[Intro: Rick Ross]
Teflon Don, woo
Ricky Ross, woo
Bricksquad, what's up? (Maybach Music)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross & Ester Dean]
I started off with a Buick, made it up to a Cady
Sold it right out my palm before we made it to baggies
Real with my people, to this very day I'm loyal
Hot up in this kitchen as my fuckin' pot spoil
All the baddest bitches Spanish girls, I call 'em 

[? 0:28]
Quick to run the train, next stop, just let your boy out
Smokin' with a Elsa, bitch, I think I'm Sosa
Peach Versace loafers, guy out, they like both now (Get money)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Yellow Benz with a spoiler kit, with my spoiled lil' chick
Yellow diamonds on my neck and wrist, match this yellow bitch
She a trip, shawty, she the shit, she know she the shit
If you don't buy her what she want then she throw a fit
She a bitch, shawty, mean as shit but she super thick
And she act silly like a kid, give her candy stick
She a pit, make her flip a brick, make her sick a chick
Since a jit, I've been slangin' dick, Gucci Mane the shit (Burr)
I met a girl name Susie, I let her join my group
I know she not a groupie, so I let her in my coupe
I stashed her in my fender wall and stashed her in my tire
Susie is a money maker but that bitch a liar
Susie roll in '08 'Rari but that girl on fire
Pull us over Candler Road, said she had some priors
Ten bricks in my car, shawty singing like Mariah
Singing like the choir, better yet singing like Mya (Bitch)

[Verse 3: Ester Dean]
Well, my name is Susie and Gucci think I love him
That sucka think I'm loyal but I fucks with all the hustlas
I be wit' all the ballas, I be at all the spots
I might be in yo' kitchen, nigga, cooking with yo' pots

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Ester Dean]
I think I love her
Nigga, you don't love me, nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I think I love her
Nigga, you don't love me, nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I know I love her
Nigga, you don't love me, nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I know I love her
Nigga, you don't love me, nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I think I love her

[Interlude: Gucci Mane]
Told my boy, man, Polow Da Don
I think I love this girl, man, huh, why?

[Verse 4: Gucci Mane & Ester Dean]
She sweet but keep kief, she stains her Irene
Two piece, she dime piece and jeans, they dead meat
She sweet, she so deep, she read with good teeth
Two jobs, she get cheese, her dates, are my treat
How neat, she loves to eat, we eat bon appétit
We feed, she's so neat and like me, she so neat
Nigga, always talk but I run the block
This bitch is so hot, my clique, I close shop
My wrist froze with rocks, I cop all the drops
Unfold all the knots, expose the have-nots
My hoes pose with pot like young Goldilocks
We got white bulging rocks, Ziploc stocks to cop
We never closin' shop, we hot, steaming hot
I'm Susie Sarah plot, a click clack, p-pop-pop

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Ester Dean]
I think I love her
Nigga, you don't love me, nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I think I love her
Nigga, you don't love me, nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I know I love her
Nigga, you don't love me, nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I know I love her
Nigga, you don't love me, nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I think I love her

[Outro: Ester Dean]
Hey, hey, hey
Get money

[Verse]
I say, "Abracadabra and hocus-pocus"
Then the top disappeared and I went to Strokers (Let's go)
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare, I ain't no local joker
But I'm locally invested in Coca-Cola (Zone 6)
I made a Holiday Season on baking soda (Holiday Season, it good)
Give you one more summer, then I'm takin' over (Guwop)
I got a hunnid pounds of loud, you can smell the odor (Holiday Season)
I got the best imported foul, but don't tell I told you (Woo)
I'm a Brick Squad soldier, I thought I told you
Mr. Ice Cream Man, I'm smoking Doja
Pull up to the bank in a brand new Testarossa
Then walked in the club and then set off an explosion

[Intro]
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh

[Verse 1]
I am the hottest in the whole metropolitan (yeah)
With so much knowledge that I overlook college, man
Is my mic on? Mama said "Just do it" so put your Nikes on
Aight mom, but these niggas out here rule this jewel to Jesus
And don't believe in me like Jews do Jesus (yeah)
I'm tryna make it out the rooms at the same reaches (aha!)
And see a million dollars but I never knew reaches (never did)
But now my change up like a picture (uh-huh)
I ain't lookin' at a poster but I see the bigger picture
And I used to do it at a momma basement like Tigga
But a nigga so hungry, I'm about to eat ya dinner (ye-up)
I'm here in the beginning and the end like winter
No matter what, was always told to "Go on! Keep your chin up!" (yeah)
Because you got to work it up like chin-ups
And get on the rebound like a sit-up, eh-heh

[Chorus]
All my life
How old they been puttin' me down? (they been puttin' me down, they been puttin' me down)
It's been all my life (uh)
Tryna get off the ground (we on the rise, we on the rise, we on the rise!)

[Verse 2]
Well, they say "You can only go as far as you can see"
If that'll determine all you could be
If that's the answers, I got 20/20 vision
'Cause a nigga out here gettin' what these other niggas didn't
Dawg, I went to eat-in like savages
So not eatin' at all like Africans
And my average is above averagin'
So they ain't gettin' none like after 

[?]
I ain't always had money but was rich in spirit
I always made noise even if you ain't hear it
No questionin', I'm ahead of them
And moved up like my last name Jefferson
The truth, my first name should've been evidence
'Cause some of y'all bitch made like estrogen
But ain't shit changed until the money out the ass
Like a nigga shit change, haha
(Damn!)

[Chorus]
All my life (uh, uh)
How old they been puttin' me down? (they been puttin' me down, they been puttin' me down)
It's been all my life (uh)
Tryna get off the ground (we on the rise, we on the rise, we on the rise!)

[Verse 3]
They underestimate 'cause I'm underage (uh-huh)
But I'll put in work like a brother that's underpaid
So, I'm paid like church on a Sunday
And fresh to death (uh), I belong on a runway
My pockets went from super broke to super swole
So now I ball like the Super Bowl
I ain't see me in the draft, it ain't eight in the morning (uh-huh)
But you see me first class (uh)
And I'm pickin' up that paper like a nigga work trash, damn!

[Chorus]
All my life (uh, uh)
How old they been puttin' me down? (they been puttin' me down, they been puttin' me down)
It's been all my life (uh)
Tryna get off the ground (we on the rise, we on the rise, we on the rise!)

[Verse 1]
As to the drifters of the high rift plains
They can see the ashes, and the acid rain
It turns to dust before my very eyes
And it chokes to death within the smog it lies

[Chorus]
​Take one look at your skies
And in the darkness realize
Kill fear, the power of lies
For we will not be hypnotized

[Verse 2]
Turn back the clock within your glass of sand
To a time of love within this blackened land
A silent child climbs a mound of char
Where he plants a seed that grows beyond the stars

[Chorus]
Take one look at your skies
And in the darkness realize
Kill fear, the power of lies
For we will not be hypnotized
Take one look at your skies
And in the darkness realize
Kill fear, the power of lies
For we will not be hypnotized

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh

Take one look at your skies
And in the darkness realize
Kill fear, the power of lies
For we will not be hypnotized

Damn, got the bleach and washing powder
I got ten G's, he make ten dollars an hour
Want some cocaine but I served his ass some flour
I count ten G's, he make ten dollars an hour
Young Gucci Gucci, I'm the Gucci Mane
I got them kilos cookies, call me the cookie man
Damn I make it rain, make it hurricane
I make Katrina, I make it Katrina
Throwin' mothafuckin' hundred dollars like a frisbee
Smokin' on the drizzy, got yo' baby momma dizzy
Uh and yo' nigga just a worker
I brought you to yo' momma house, smellin' like purple

[Intro]
Drumma Boy
Brrr (Hey boy)
Big Gucci (Hey)
Yo playa (Hey boy)
Brrr

[Verse 1]
I got a homie named Frankie (Frankie), last name Mueller
And he hang with my panky (Panky), ice cooler
And my role you should thank me (Thank me), thank my jeweler
'Cause he got me so icy (Brrr)
If another hater try to take my jewelry, I'ma probably have to go and pick a jury
I'm goin' M6 karats, can you hear me?
I'm so flashy, suckas can't stand near me
When I be a granddad, I tell my grandchildren
When I was 30 years old, I had 30 million
Came a long way from trappin' in a vacant building 60,000 people screaming such a great feelin' (Gucci)

[Chorus]
Think he all that, he think he all that
He think he all that but I don't believe that
Gucci Mane wack, Gucci can't rap
Gucci ain't trap but you don't believe that
I'm tryin' to get fat checks and all that
You think you go harder but I don't believe that
And you don't believe that
Know you from way back
You don't believe that and I don't believe that
We just don't believe that

[Verse 2]
It is not that easy
You gon' have to try harder to deceive me
Before I ever started gettin' rap money (Money)
I was wrappin' up them things like a mummy (Dummies)
Your whole crew like food for my tummy
And I'm hungry right now so its ovey
I'm the hood MVP with a trophy (A trophy)
I got five rings on like I'm Kobe (I'm Kobe)
I'm puttin' it down like my good partner Toby (Toby)
He in the feds, yeah, them people gave him 40
I'm still ridin' around the city with the .40 (Shawty)
I think what the fuck I wanna think just run up on me (On me)

[Chorus]
Think he all that, he think he all that
He think he all that but I don't believe that
Gucci Mane wack, Gucci can't rap
Gucci ain't trap but you don't believe that
I'm tryin' to get fat checks and all that
You think you go harder but I don't believe that
And you don't believe that
Know you from way back
You don't believe that and I don't believe that
We just don't believe that

[Verse 3]
I just got a text message, should I say a sex message?
Say she got an ice fetish, told her get her mouth ready
Hydro got my light-headed, Lambo got her sightseein'
Not the average human bein' so I'm ridin' in European
Paid 'em and I bring 'em in, start out friends and end up fuckin'
Please don't ask her once again, they at my hotel goin' in
Gucci Mane be goin' in, fuck your throat, go again
DJ hit my ho again, tell me what you recommend
I put it down, I fly em in, fly 'em out then go again
I get around like 2Pac 94' but its 2010
17 Brick Squad Records, I'm a busy man
Stay out Gucci business, this ain't where the rings on Gucci hands

[Chorus]
Think he all that, he think he all that
He think he all that but I don't believe that
Gucci Mane wack, Gucci can't rap
Gucci ain't trap but you don't believe that
I'm tryin' to get fat checks and all that
You think you go harder but I don't believe that
And you don't believe that
Know you from way back
You don't believe that and I don't believe that
We just don't believe that

[Verse 1]
Gucci Mane, I'm the goddamn man
Ten diamonds on my hand
Damn, who's your diamond man?
Illest rapper in the industry be askin' man
But he 

[?] Gucci the 

[?]
Took her to the tale but Gucci done bought her furniture
I keep her hair thick so hoes can't outshine her
You little bitty stone, then Gucci 

[?] her
Everything designer, truly hard to find her
Dine with a man who I can buy some diamonds
Pink princess color carats got her shinin'
Pound of bubble kush and purple 

[?] when she reminded me
If I'm not home, the trap is where you find me
"Gucci, what you doing baby? Cookin' up a nine-piece"
I'll be home shortly so baby just wait for me
Game ain't promise us tomorrow so pray for me

[Chorus]
I can't stop sellin' blocks
Baby, I won't stop, I'ma sell these blocks
I can't stop and I won't stop
But one rule I got is respect my gwap
I can't stop sellin' blocks
Baby, I won't sellin', I'ma sell these blocks
Baby, I can't stop, baby, I won't stop
Only rule I got is respect my gwap

[Verse 2]
They call me guacamole, Jocab, not the Rollie
80 grand Louie, yellow diamonds are moonin'
Green diamonds are groovy, pink diamonds are fruity
Black diamonds are ruthless but the watches are stupid
I'm overdoin' it, Benz coupe on the dub trays
Lev came back to the part, that's a replay
Eight 10, 15, 20 in one day
30, 40, 50 G's, made that in one play
Shawty hit my onion, he say he want gunplay
A stubbed .357 to me a AK
A 3A stub nose workin' like SK
Shawty want some gunplay, meet me on the foreway

[Chorus]
I can't stop sellin' blocks
Baby, I won't stop, I'ma sell these blocks
I can't stop and I won't stop
But one rule I got is respect my gwap
I can't stop sellin' blocks
Baby, I won't sellin', I'ma sell these blocks
Baby, I can't stop, baby, I won't stop
Only rule I got is respect my gwap

[Verse 3]
A mill' worth of jewels, 1:06, get a interview
Still in the 6, wrappin' bricks in the M2
A brick for a feature? A bill for a interlude?
Bust the brick like the twat of a prostitute
Mustard colored Benz and the diamonds are mustard
Red inside with the ketchup tennis shoes
Meatloaf Bugatti, Asantis are gravy
Me and Mony Mo goin' half on the baby
A baby time four time ten time ten
Charged nigga one just to bring the shit in
I'm 

[?] 20 shawty 

[?] shawty
I'm autogram shawty, Gucci, don't shout me

[Chorus]
I can't stop sellin' blocks
Baby, I won't stop, I'ma sell these blocks
I can't stop and I won't stop
But one rule I got is respect my gwap
I can't stop sellin' blocks
Baby, I won't sellin', I'ma sell these blocks
Baby, I can't stop, baby, I won't stop
Only rule I got is respect my gwap

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
If you're out there in the street, and your lookin for me
Bitch, I be hustlin like a dog, tryna make ends meet
Anybody ever try to get in my way
Then you know Imma be going to jail for murder today

[Verse 1: Boo]
Put the shot, then head straight to the block
Call me and Wayne Smooth with the rock
Rich and move work, you get it out quick

Blow one, motherfucker, get how we live
But we still throgh it up, that's how we is

[Verse 2: Mack Maine]
Make it rain, make it flood in the drout

That's why I chuck 4 blocks, come with 4 pocks
Bad bitches cookin for me, the feends is lookin for me

Pour up a 4 a lil, before I'm myself
You know you might see me on the flight, or in the Caraira
Yeah, we got that white, but we still the stars of the eara

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
If you're out there in the street, and your lookin for me
Bitch, I be hustlin like a dog, tryna make ends meet
Anybody ever try to get in my way
Then you know Imma be going to jail for murder today

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Smokin something, man, feelings beating me down
Bad asses, sellin Crack and stacks
Shit whent from tarific to tragic
Niggas talkin shit, I'll put a hit out on them bastards
Slow them boys down, like Los Angeles trafic
My diamonds is dancin, like television static
Don't throgh the coach on the first day of practice
Donuts in the 24, bitch, I'm matchin
I'm a green feend, no controlin me
Talkin bout that Cabbage, I be stackin
You niggas is pussy, you be foldin and crackin
My niggas is wishin, I tell m to have it and let shit happen
Cuttin down the neck from the bottom of the baskit
These 16s make you rearange your brackets
Hit the final four with my final horse
Fall asleep in the sky, box orbs

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
If you're out there in the street, and your lookin for me
Bitch, I be hustlin like a dog, tryna make ends meet
Anybody ever try to get in my way

[Verse 4: Mack Maine]
Hate it or love it, we thuggin in public
You rappers ain't eatin, your food cost out of your budget
Your rappers half edea, you spittin your court cases
I spit that boss music, try the fource music

And I ain't talkin Coopes, I said pay attention

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
If you're out there in the street, and your lookin for me
Bitch, I be hustlin like a dog, tryna make ends meet

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
As I kick back and relax, shorty head in my lap
In the back of the Bentley, getting head in the back
And she ain't got a head from a nap, so pushin on her head from the back, give me that
Up and down, down and up, give me that
Laffy Taffy came on, she give me head to the snaps
She make me like the song, she wrong
She bout action, bout work
She suck dick like a vacume suck durt
I'm a quick picker upper, cause she quick to pick me out
Quicker than a nigga tell her, pick the nut up
Now let me tell you bout this 6 shot Roogger
That I keep for you busters if you twitch, I shoot shit
I'll buck ya, I'll bang ya, move ya like a dead car battery
Trust me, boost ya, no car cables
I'll hang ya, like a coat in the closet, no coat on the hanger
Just hanging in the closet, boy, I could just leave you where you stand, or I could just shoot you in the end, meet you where you land

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I came to rep my hood, I gotta ride clean
I gotta smoke good
I'm ballin on big, fancy cars like Suge
I ain't gotta explain what's already understood
Baby, I'm a G, I'm just tryna get more
I'm hot as 3 80, keep it warm like wool
Niggas talkin shit, I wish a nigga would
Boy, smellin like shit, from a bull, boy
I gotta lot, but I could never get enough
Man, the 26 inches got the Lolo sittin up
Mack could fix it, so you need to hit him up
Rocky Marsiano, I beat the pussy up
You not a Saprano, pussy nigga, get fucked
Hit a nigga from a hundred yards away
You really ain't prepared, dog, chopper split your ass in half, not even share ya
That's the game, stop lookin for a fair call
Pussy cat niggas, watch you cough up a hairball
Lookin at niggas, like why you scared, dog
Chopper rip you apart, doesn't cut hair, dog
These niggas Aerosol, soft shell Taco
Move in the Farari like a wild horse, or in my case, a mob boss
Feel my swagger, nigga
I'm walkin round with a chopper and a dagger
You play with me, faster
Pop pop, don't play with me, Casper
Duct tape, don't play with the rapper
I send it to m whole, they goin cut it faster
Bitch, make me bitch
If not, make me cum, then make me twist
Bitch, blowin these dice, make me bitch
Watch me grip my whole hand on the 8 or 6
The 5 or the 4 or the 10 or the 9
Hey lil rapper, it's fighting time

[Intro: Juelz Santana & Lil Wayne]
It's me again

[?] crack in the flesh
Santana, baby
I know y'all remember this
Yeah
Let's do it

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
A fucked up childhood, had me like damn (damn)
Watching how I move, how I hustle, how I stand (yup)
Bad enough I'm watchin for the cops in white vans (ooh)
Then I go and cop them white grams
Pop! They like, "Scram!"
I'm like, man, I gotta eat somehow, some way
Soon, now, today, ayy, listen
Told papi, "I got cake to spend, I got eight to spend
I got a spot waitin for me to put weight up in"
He said, "I like that! Here, pay for this, I front you that"
I looked, said, "Nigga, I'll be right back"
And I was right back, with that cash
Exact cash, like, "Look, now I need twice that"
I made a vow that I wouldn't be broke, I couldn't be broke
And as a man, I shouldn't be broke (nope)
So I learned how to cook, make a cookie from coke
Fiends love a good piece of cookie to smoke
And I knew that!
Now I could take ten of these, easily bake ten of these
My whip game sick, mayne, bring back slave memories
Kept those fifths with me, better safe than sorry
I wasn't just gon' let no kid stick me
I wasn't just gon' let no kid hit me (nah)
Leave me on the ground
I'm tryna send those kids with me (yup)
That's just some obstacles you go through
In the process of profiting
And progressing, they always tryna knock a man (man!)
Sometimes, you gotta pop the man, drop a man
Another obstacle to stop a man from stopping you (uh-huh!)
I thought I'd never stop dishing the white out
'Til I was treated like a surfboard and physically wiped out
Then, I thought about all the shit I could write 'bout
All the shit my life 'bout, and quick got the mic out

[Refrain: Juelz Santana]
So, be on the lookout for a straight-up menace, ayy!
Nigga be, nigga be, nigga be, nigga be
Be on the lookout for a straight-up menace, ayy!

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Ayy! Yeah, yeah
I love it! Yeah
You already know, you already know
You already know, you already know

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I don't wanna hurt nobody, but I promise
But I promise if you try me, we gon' have to rewind this track
And make me go back, that thing'll go rrrat!
That boy'll lay flat, so flat
That Act' is what I perform, all you haters
Have me in all black, like a Oakland Raider
See, I know that game, I know them scores
If your wrist ain't broke, then the world is yours
I'm feeling like Scarface, like the Cohiba
Streets reply, I look right in the four-seater
You know, I be I, get right in the four-seater
Top floor of the Four Seasons
Four of them girls
And they all know how to cook it up
And, nigga, I got some
And only one know how to bag up, bundle up
It's a cold world, now homie bundle up
We ain't on this grind for nothing, we get our hustle up

[Outro: Juelz Santana & Lil Wayne]
Ayy! It's me again

[?] crack in the flesh
Get ya money
Back Like Cooked Crack Part 2 (you know?)
The first one was sorta like a classic, you know? (crazy)
There's a lot of politics and bullshit (you know?)
But I am back like crack, baby (that's right)
So, be on the lookout for a straight-up menace

[Verse 1]
Life's a party, baby, do what you wanna do (whoa, ah)
It's all a party, baby, and I like to move with you
There's a rhythm, you can feel it, you my girl, then you mine
And if all you do is worry, you'll be running out of time
So what's the use, our time is ticking, what's your groove?

[Chorus]
But just remember we 'gon do it (ohh, alright)
Get in this party, baby, do it (ohh, all night)
This is a one time function (ohh, alright)
Move at this party, we can do it (ohh, all night) Ray, ugh

[Bridge]
Ayo-ayo-ayo (ayo-ayo-ayo)
Ayo-ayo-ayo (ayo-ayo-ayo)
Ayo-ayo-ayo (ayo-ayo-ayo)
Ayo-ayo-ayo (ayo-ayo-ayo)

[Verse 2]
This is the party baby, I wanna move with you
Try to enjoy yourself cause it might be over soon
Lost some friends at the party, had to leave early on
But we still gon' have a good time, gonna party break of dawn
So don't be you, cause all this party needs is you

[Chorus]
But just remember we gone do it (ohh, alright)
Get in this party baby, do it (ohh, all night)
This is a one time function (ohh, alright)
Move at this party, we can do it (ohh, all night) hay-oh-oh

[Verse 3]
Sign your name on the line, signature or initial
More like a get together, nothing really official
Shark attack overdose, standing next to the edge
Trying to get that picture, you ain't taking a picture
You ain't in the moment, everything that they feed you is sweet
And that sugar corny, my flavor, they can't control it
This that party you gotta move, but then you 'gon break a move

[Chorus]
But just remember they gon' do it
Get in this party, make 'em do it, baby
Baby this is a one time function, uh
Move at this party, we gon' do it
(Bring that sound in, ohh, ayo)

[Outro]
We gon' do it. get in this party, make you do it
This is a one time function, move at this party, we gon' do it
(Overtime)
We gon' do it, get in this party, make you do it (do-it-do-it-do-it)
This is a one time function
Ayo-ayo-ayo (ayo-ayo-ayo)
Move at this party, we gon' do it
Ayo-ayo-ayo (ayo-ayo-ayo)
Just remember we gon' do it
Ayo-ayo-ayo (ayo-ayo-ayo)
Get in this party, make 'em do it
Ayo-ayo-ayo (ayo-ayo-ayo)

[Verse 1]
Supercomputer status, walkin' along streets
Everyone is an addict, stumbling concrete
What was the motivation? Constant communication
Everybody wanna get chose like Moses
Came out Mother Earth smelling like roses
Summon the new edition, made it way too efficient
Made us the guinea pig and did it with no permission
Told it to call a friend, didn't tell it to listen
So very scary, so binary, zero or one
Like or dislike, coal mine canary
I dream in color, not black and white
You sell your daughter on that data stream
Dopamine make it hit now
Humans don't understand, humans gon' sell a lie
Humans gotta survive, we know we gon' die
Nothing can live forever, you know we gon' try
Life, is it really worth it? The algorhythm is perfect, mmh

[Chorus]
Everybody (Everybody), move your body, now do it (Now do it)
Here is something (Ooh), that's gonna make you move and groove
(Please don't lose that tempo)
Algorhythm
(Moving how they say so)
Algorhythm

[Verse 2]
Step, step, slide, slide
Move your body from side to side
Clap your hands, don't spite the vibe
Keep on moving, you might survive
Pressure is to evolve, take a bite of the apple
We crush it into the sauce, how do we know the cost?
How do we know the truth without feeling what could be false?
Freedom of being wrong, freedom of being lost
Wait a minute, wait a minute (Wait a minute, wait a minute)
Feelin' like the devil did it (Devil did it, ooh)
Lord willing, I'ma step to it (Step to it)
You gon' fall behind if you can't do it (Ooh, yeah)
Ooh, we eating good over here now (Yeah)
Is you eating good over there now? (No)
Human ain't the move, do I care now? (No)
Looking for something worth it, the algorhythm is perfect, mmh

[Chorus]
Everybody (Everybody), move your body, now do it (Now do it)
Here is something (Ooh), that's gonna make you move and groove
(Please don't lose that tempo)
Algorhythm
(Moving how they say so)
Algorhythm (Woo)
Everybody (Everybody), move your body, now do it (Now do it)
Here is something (Ooh), that's gonna make you move and groove
Algorhythm (Woo)
Algorhythm (Yeah, yeah)

[Instrumental]

[Interlude: Tyler the Creator & Random Girl]
Gap tooth T on the keys

[moan]

[Outro & Sample: Shane Powers]
That was new music from the soundtrack of the upcoming film 

[honk]
Be caller eight to win tickets to the triple feature the Moon Theatres tonight
Three back to back to back movies at the Moon Theatres tonight
Be the eighth caller, only on Golf Radio
G-G-O-L-F
G-O-L-F
It's Golf Radio
I drove right by the freeway on ramp
The freeway on ramp, the freeway on ramp
In an act of desperation
I tried so hard to be patient
To be patient, to be patient
All I need is one more trip to the gas station

I packed everything I own
Everything I own, everything I own
In that big green suitcase
And honestly I thought I was alone
I thought I was alone, I thought I was alone
Until I saw your face

You and I, we paid our tax
And covered our tracks and never turned our backs
And you and I went along those train tracks for miles and miles
And everyone who turned your backs
Never turned our backs
Never turned our backs
Never turned our backs
I packed everything I own
Everything I own, everything I own
Into that big green suitcase

[Intro]
Wow, San Diego thank you so much for such an amazing evening
Now this is our last song, are you guys ready to party?
One, one, one, one, one

[Verse 1]
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me, c'mon
(Too many times, too many times)

[Pre-Chorus]
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

[Chorus]
Let me hear you!
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Post-Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

[Verse 2]
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)

[Pre-Chorus]
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself (What do I say?)
I do, I do, I do

[Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Post-Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

[Bridge]
Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I (I got new)

[Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone (Yeah)
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone (Alone)
Two: Don't let him in (Uh-ooh)
You'll have to kick him out again (Again)
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Post-Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em (Hey!)
I got new rules, I count 'em (Woo!)
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
San Diego let me see you drop it! (Hey hey)
I gotta tell them to myself

[Outro]
Don't let him in, don't let him in (Jump, jump, jump)
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't let him in, don't let him in (Hey!)
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
You're gettin' over him
San Diego make some noise!
Thank you so much!
I love you, we love you and we'll be back
My name is Dua Lipa, I love you, goodnight

[Verse 1]
I still watch you when you're groovin'
As if through water from the bottom of a pool
You're movin' without movin'
And when you move, I'm moved
You are a call to motion
There, all of you a verb in perfect view
Like Jonah on the ocean
When you move, I'm moved

[Pre-Chorus]
When you move
I'm put to mind of all that I wanna be
When you move
I could never define all that you are to me

[Chorus]
So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby

[Verse 2]
You are the rite of movement
Its reasonin' made lucid and cool
I know it's no improvement
When you move, I move
You're S. Polunin leapin'
Or Fred Astaire in sequence
Honey, you, you're Atlas in his sleepin'
And when you move, I'm moved

[Pre-Chorus]
When you move
I can recall somethin' that's gone from me
When you move
Honey, I'm put in awe of somethin' so flawed and free

[Chorus]
So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to prove
And nothin' to lose
Move me, baby

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh baby, oh baby
Move like grey skies
Move like a bird of paradise
Move like an odd sight come out at night

[Chorus]
Move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to lose
And nothin' to prove
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby

[Instrumental]

[Skit: Tyler, the Creator and Woman]
Can you roll my window up?
The fuck you turn my music down for, man?
Can you roll my window up?
Why? Damn!
Cause it's windy!
But I love it when your hair-

[Outro]

[Open the car door, enters and closes it]
Yeah man what's-

[Verse 1]
I hear a sound
It's going through my brain
I hear talk of people
I feel the fallin' rain

[Verse 2]
I see a man crying
'Cause the whole world has let him down
Kids are laughing at funny faces
Of a clown

[Verse 3]
My mind is like a spring in a clock
It won't unwind
I can't see, can't think, can't feel
I'm out of time

[Verse 4]
Well, I'm up and I'm down
Now tell me where is it going to end
And you say start at the beginning of the end
My friend

[Verse 5]
I hear thunder
And I can feel the wind
And I can see angry faces
In the eyes of men

[Verse 6]
And don't forget Kent State
Where kids lay bleeding on the ground
And there's no place on this planet
Where peace can be found

[Verse 7]
So there'll be stabbings and shootings
And young men dying all around
And it keeps going through my brain
And I can still hear the sound

[Outro]
I hear talking of people
The whole world has gone insane
And all there is left is the fallin' rain
And all there is left is the fallin' rain
And all there is left is the fallin' rain

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Uh, number ones around Afros
Making figures like Hasbros
Off the field we still keep the helmet like Daft shows
Vietnam how the draft flows, private browsing, cash flows
Flow, flow, double deck, cash cash, that's a double check
Two jobs, double desk
Keep a magnum on me, you are not a fucking threat
That Vietnam, I'm too mature, dawg, I'm a ducking vet
Freudian slip, I correct my mistakes just to scope
One eye open, one eye closed, sniper face (ah, ah, ah!)
One eye open, one eye closed, pirate face
One eye woke while one hibernate
Look, it's colored people time
Both eyes open, and that is how you isolate
Optimally-speaking, global warming, ice is late
ISIS, I.C.E. is too, baby
Oh you cold cold? I'm both though
Stay dangerous as YG, you safer than a Volvo
You buy these, I sell those, I'm Crenshaw, you Melrose
Like huh? (Huh, huh, huh, huh, huuuuh)
That's street street, let's go fleet fleet
That's thirty sixes like 3 police (Woo woo woooo)
You can even lease, I'm Stephen King meets Jean Baptiste (Yeah!)
Rip locs, get the drum or something, that's 1500 or nothing huh?
These goofy niggas with they summer runs think they runnin' somethin'
They don't want none of him
I'm losing nigga, my head band is number one
The otaku, they don't understand where I'm comin' from
Choir singing and the pastor preaching and nuns will hum
Speak tongues to them, and I'm done with thought
And I ain't even begun it young, wave
Yuhh!

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Sometimes it feels when i’m
When I’m with you, it’s ecstasy (Oh oh, whoa, oh oh)
Sometimes it feels like we, met for a purpose, we’re meant to be (Ooh, oh)
And sometimes I feel like I can’t
Sometimes I feel like I can’t control it (Whoa)

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
One step, two step, three, fourth step, start to see
It’s time to take things further (Further, whoa)
And maybe you will be the one to set me free
I’m just waiting ‘til I know for sure

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
For sure, ‘til I know for sure (What?), ‘til I know for sure (What?)
For sure, ‘til I know for sure (What?), ‘til I know for sure (Uh, yeah), for sure
I’m not gonna waste my time (No)
If things are just not going right (Yeah)
For sure, ‘til I know for sure (What?), ‘til I know for sure

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Whenever you’re in my arms
It feels like it’s just a dream
I’m feeling you close to my heart and it blows me away
And everything will be okay
All I gotta see is your ways
I got so much love to give and it’s coming today

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
One step, two step, three, fourth step, start to see
It’s time to take things further (Further, whoa)
And maybe you will be the one to set me free
Yeah, I’m just waiting ‘til I know for sure (Know for sure)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
For sure, ‘til I know for sure (What?), ‘til I know for sure (What?)
For sure, ‘till I know for sure (What?), ‘til I know for sure (Uh, yeah), for sure
I’m not gonna waste my time (No)
If things are just not going right (Yeah)
For sure, ‘til I know for sure (What?), ‘til I know for sure

[Verse 3: Lil Za]
We can make it as long as we stay consistent
She looking for that special someone but tell me who isn’t?
Stuck in the middle, what ecstasy so wet it’s dripping?
I’m usually pimpin’ but tonight I pay you a visit
I knock on the door, she already ready
Model-type body, the genetics from granny
It’s going down, I got the world in my hands
I take you to Rome, way to pass the moon if I can
But anyway, the connection was unbreakable
So deep in that grip, ain’t no saving you
Ain’t nobody know about this situation
So turn off all the phones, no time for conversating
Looking in your eye is just like I travel back in time
I say to God I made her angry
You Heaven said I can't thank Him enough
To jump back into this world, is kinda testing your luck
But every now and then we get stuck, there’s broken trust
Mentally I thought we was perfect, the way we started
But mentally you got to my heart and then disregarded

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
For sure, ‘til I know for sure (What?), ‘till I know for sure (What?)
For sure, ‘til I know for sure (What?), ‘til I know for sure (Uh, yeah), for sure
I’m not gonna waste my time (No)
If things are just not going right (Yeah)
For sure, ‘til I know for sure (What?), ‘til I know for sure
Before the line say - me and you
Once upon a time in another episode
We knew every line, but we still didn't play the roles
Now I can rewind - there she goes x3
-
Now I got
No equal for my sequel
All alone in a sequel

[Verse ?: Justin Timberlake]
That's my shit
I told you, baby
Tryna get your sexy back
I wanna text you baby
What it look like?
That's over baby
But we can party all night
No sober, baby
We wanna...

People don't you be afraid
So many innocent's slain

Every shade was beautifully made

Where skin don't define any human
And stars are the only thing shootin'
Shootin', oh, oh

[Verse 4: Jussie Smollett]
Mothers that bury their child
How can we sit there and hide
Change comes when all take a stand
Now stand up, stand up

[Pre-Hook: Jussie Smollett & Alicia Keys]
Martin's speech still echoes in my brain
Every shade was beautifully made

Lyrics from Snippet

What you wanna do? (Wanna do, wanna do)
What you wanna do when it's killers in the room? (In the room, in the room)
In the room (In the room, in the room)
Killer catwalk, it's gone too soon (It's gone too soon)
New chune (New chune, new chune)
Have a good day, bitch, this is Monsé (Monsé, Monsé)
Monsé (Monsé, Monsé)
Baby, by the way, parlez-vous français? (Français, Français)
What do you have to say?

[Verse 1]
In the shadows he saw four eyes, lit by fire
Fire
He’d never done that with a lover before
Before
Meanwhile everyone else got lost in quiet
By the river
Seeking for more, of course he found better

[Chorus]
He saw them, they saw him
But everyone just kept on going
What he saw was different
He should have gone to bed
But instead he stuck around for the mood

[Verse 2]
In the shadows he saw four eyes, lit by fire
Fire
He’d never done that with a lover before
Before
He was seeking for more
Either early or too late, it was number seven
And it happened
High like a bird with his beak through the window

[Chorus]
He saw them, they saw him
But everyone just kept on going
What he saw was different
He should have gone to bed
But instead he stuck around for the mood

[Chorus]
He saw them, they saw him
But everyone just kept on going
What he saw was different
He should have gone to bed
But instead he stuck around for the mood

[Outro]
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more

[Intro: Dave Chappelle]
(Ay papi, Meek apúrate, fuck)
No more apologizing for being excellent
(Eso no importa pues, apúrate)
From now on man, fuck it, I'm just gon' be dope
(Quiero la plata, nada más)
And not apologize for it
I'm sorry I'm dope, nigga (Dámelo todo, lo quiero ya, ya mismo)
Wrap your mind around it, embrace it, this is a fact of life
(Mmm, papi)
God, I am so good (Bangladesh)
Thank you

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah, fuck up that money, then make it again
I fuck her twice, then I make her my friend
Shit, look at these haters, they hatin' again
I know they don't like it, they takin' it in
Fuck up a check, then we makin' it back
She like Chanel, I'ma drape her in that
She want the D, I've been waitin' on that
I've been doing my thing, they've been hatin' on that
And I meant what I said, I ain't takin' it back
We get you chain, we ain't takin' it back
Reach for my chain, get a fracture for that
Only speak on my name when you statin' the facts, please
I know we ballin' too much
And all of these pretty hoes fallin' for us
I say, "Ven aquí mami," and call her to us
If I give you my number, don't call me too much, comprende?
City to city, bad bitches and titties
She jump on the jet with me, she on the tour
I'm in Balenci', Laurent and Givenchy
My pockets on Benji and she in Dior
Flex on the 'Gram just to look like you got it
But really you broke (But really you broke)
Seen suckas pop shit on their Twitter
Like killers and really get smoked (Really get smoked)
Know niggas that used to be trappers on Twitter
Just telling us jokes (Telling us jokes)
While we gettin' money, just burnin' this bread
Tryna turn it to toast, for real
They say we talk about money too much
But maybe they ain't gettin' money enough
I say, "Dímelo, papi," he come with a truck
He gon' make me a tab and I'm runnin' it up, gracias

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Let me welcome you, get introduced to the king
Bentleys, Ferraris, brand new and they clean
So disappointed when niggas talk shit on their records
You see 'em, don't do anything
Okay, killin' these niggas with more than before
Been stuntin' and shinin' since back in the 90's
I'm 'bout it, forgot it, the Glock in my pocket
Remind you and plus the whole city behind me
Spent hundreds of thousands, no millions on diamonds
In Philly, they go ask Meek Milly about me
I'm solid and thorough, stand up as fuck
See these niggas, I just be like, 'What the fuck?'
Ain't no way in the hell you can fuck with us
Like a bad bitch with no furniture, I can't do nothin' with her
Still hit her and them bad bitches who hung with her
That's how I do it, can't give you the formula
Don't stop me now, I'm just warmin' up
Niggas be actin', the fuck they performin' for
Leave 'em right there for the coroner
Man, my bitch look so bad, she a foreigner
Aston Martin, the attire is formal
How we kick it, ain't shit 'bout us normal
We Grand Hustle, and schemin' and chasin' our dream
Stackin' that paper
Hearin' my raps and you see me, you see what I mean
Drippin' that flavor
Fuck niggas hatin', don't try me, I split that potato
Then go sit and eat with the mayor, skiin' in Vail
David Chappelle told me you niggas is funny as hell
Run to the smoke and then runnin' to tell
Open the vault, put you under the jail, damn!

[Outro: Female voice & T.I.]
Como dice Pablo 'Plata O Plomo'?
Así es como es
Que te vaya bien, bitch!
Hey, que pasa, mi amigo
You know that nigga?
Ay, tranquilo
What'd he do?
Hahahaha
Ask him if he got some weed
Yo quiero grande mota
Man, what'd you just say?
Cómo se dice "a lot of weed?"
(Yeah) Yeah yo quiero grande mota
Okay (Huh?)
Cocaína? (Hell yeah)
Mucho (We want that)
Ahahahahaha
Ya dig?

[Intro: T.I.]
Yeah
Hey man
I got a real short list of shit I like to do
Ya dig
Get money (Yeah)
Kick shit (I Just wanna ball, yeah)
That's the list, nigga, that's it

[Chorus: T.I.]
I just wanna ball in the wraith
With your broad in the way
And I wanna, I'ma take my shot
I pray to God, is it all in a day
Leave your daughter with the papers
Fuck a hater 'til the day I die (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck what them bitches saying, fuck what them niggas doing
Before you were getting going, I was getting to it

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Put it down, bankrolls in the neighborhood
Was catching cases, before I got to get some paper good
Lil homie asked me "Unc, how do you know you came up?"
I said you deal with less bitches wearing lace fronts
I don't like her, feel that way about a lot of rappers
I don't talk about 'em
Most these niggas ain't gon' bust a grape and they just talking loud
Godbody, got a problem, nigga go to war about it
Hm, having problems understanding your logic, man
For four hundred, I'll take your honey and tour London
Get some more money
Don't believe me? Well, you a dummy
Ain't no pun intended
Military guns in the mansion
Ain't no runnin' in it
A rubber when I fucked that bitch
It ain't no cumming in it
Since my first album, I been serious
Ain't no funny business
Bitch, ain't no funny business
No weapon against me shall prosper
But it's welcome to form
Knew from the day I was born I'd perform in the Forum
Ringing bells and blowing horns when my name called
I'm just a self-made nigga in the wraith though

[Chorus: T.I.]
I just wanna ball in the wraith
With your broad in the way
And I wanna, I'ma take my shot
I pray to God, is it all in a day
Leave your daughter with the papers
Fuck a hater 'til the day I die (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck what them bitches saying, fuck what them niggas doing
Before you were getting going, I was getting to it
I just wanna ball in the wraith
With your broad in the way
And I wanna, I'ma take my shot (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I'm a dope boy legend
Street I'm reppin
Not a stone in a watch, no charm on the necklace
They say I'm reckless, yeah, I might be
Don't give a fuck about no nigga who don't like me
Now, if I go to jail today, that bitch gon' write me? No
She gon' fuck me? No, if a nigga go broke
I bet a Wraith on the Super Bowl
In the kitchen, super cold
Six ounce, four pints, that's a super stove
Before I ever had a plaque and a hit
Boy, I bet I had a MAC and some bricks
If it's stars in the wraith, got the titles in the safe
Got the lawyers on deck, got the money for the case
Truck, truck, Lambo
Guns, guns, ammo
Me and Black Youngsta, back to back cause that's my fam-o
He a white man, kill him
For his shit, she want a check for the pussy
That's that out the North shit

[Chorus: T.I.]
I just wanna ball in the wraith
With your broad in the way
And I wanna, I'ma take my shot
I pray to God, is it all in a day
Leave your daughter with the papers
Fuck a hater 'til the day I die (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck what them bitches saying, fuck what them niggas doing
Before you were getting going, I was getting to it
I just wanna ball in the wraith
With your broad in the way
And I wanna, I'ma take my shot (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Presidential swag
In the slum with the hairnet
Running up a bag, do it for 'em just to pass out
Dab in my bag, give it to her, wear her ass out
Dick game great, give it to her till she pass out
This the real caine, add B12, pour baking soda
Stretch a quarter out a whole, and no details (No!)
Shout to all my niggas, who legitimized they figures
Now they rich and you just get it out the blue
Now he ridin' in the Rolls Royce
Came out the bottom, now he making more than ol' boy
Always been a hustler, not a robber, I never stole nothing
Trappin', flippin' work till they come up on a whole one
Huh ok, K-I-N-G, can't deny me
Niggas still rhymin' 'bout what we did in the 90's, nigga
Yeah, see it on my face, dawg
I'm just a real nigga riding ridin' under Wraith stars

[Chorus: T.I.]
I just wanna ball in the wraith
With your broad in the way
And I wanna, I'ma take my shot
I pray to God, it's all in a day
Leave your daughter  with the papers
Fuck a hater 'til the day I die (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck what them bitches saying, fuck what them niggas doing
Before you were getting going, I was getting to it
I just wanna ball in the wraith
With your broad in the way
And I wanna, I'ma take my shot (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Dave Chappelle and T.I.]
Dave Chappelle: You gone have to run this back! Hold on, one second, tho. God damn, nigga, I wasn't ready for that!
Yo, this gotta make the album
T.I.: Mmm, Everything I'm playing you is going on the album
Dave Chappelle: Nigga, this that nitty gritty for the city. That shit is what's up, like.. ding ding ding ding ding ding. Beat sound sneaky as shit! I like that. I like that

[Intro: The Weeknd]
Woah, don't you, baby, hey
It won't matter, baby
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
Woah, don't you, baby, hey
It won't matter, baby
Don't you know?
Don't you know?

[Verse]
Uh, make it out the hood, they say you Hollywood
How dare you niggas tell me that I got it good
Gotta check and treat these niggas like I'm Robin Hood
When it was time to stand up for me, see, nobody stood
And I was lookin' at you niggas, all the ones I fed
Had me grindin' all them nights when you was going to bed
And if you think I owe you something, nigga gon' ahead
Treat you like I never knew you, put it on your head
And I got Papi on my line like, 'When you comin' home?'
My mama see it in my face, she know that somethin' wrong
Bodies droppin' in my city all summer long
Out on bail but I still gotta keep somethin' on
'Cause I can't let 'em take my life, you might get left you make that right
When he got left it wasn't right, but he was tryna live that life
I call up Coon to book that jet, we like three deep, we take that flight
Used to land in California to play that studio all night, we stayin' down
For the love of them millions, ain't layin' down
Left you in the hood, what you sayin' now?
And niggas wanted the smoke, you said, "Stand down," uh
Cold heart, never get cold feet when the pressure come
It was beef, I had to tell niggas, "You better come"
Sister said they gettin' over, it's like you lettin' them
Some shit I had to learn my lesson from, uh
Checkin' in, checkin' out, I just had to check you out
2012, it was 50 niggas when I'm steppin' out
Forgot the time you asked me for a check and I ain't lend it out
I ain't even know you was upset, that's what this shit about?
A green piece of paper can turn you to a hater
When you can't bring up one time you returned me for a favor
So I pray these niggas real close, talkin' closer than my neighbors
'Cause I know the signs when niggas switch sides, catch them vapors

[Chorus]
Used to be my dawg, you was in my left titty
Scream, "Ride or die," I thought you would ride with me
Found out you was jealous, you wouldn't even grind with me
And when I copped the 6 you wanted the 550
Used to be my dawg, you was in my left titty
Scream, "Ride or die," I thought you would ride with me
Found out you was jealous, you wouldn't even grind with me
And when I copped the 6 you wanted the 550

[Outro]
See, I look at it like this
What I'm supposed to spend a thousand nights in the studio rappin' my lights out?
Goin' city to city, can't take my son to school when I want to, can't see my mama, my family when I want to
They give a nigga my money, then act like he hangin' with me
I ain't never been sweet
Far as I can remember, every time I went to jail I had to stand up in that bitch by myself
I ain't never even think about a nigga callin' my baby mama to pick my son up to take him to the movies
Go play basketball while I'm doin' this time in the cell
Actin' like I owe you somethin'
See, it hurt my heart to see some of my closest friends turn their back on me about that attention needle
Or a green piece of paper with a slave master on the front of that shit
I used to hear niggas, niggas that I was feedin', I heard 'em whisperin', "Meek Mill finished"
I was like, "And damn, I was feedin' you, bro"
All I did was keep grindin'
Through the storm, nigga, I'm like Derrick Rose on a 50-point night on a daily basis, nigga
For the love of the millions, royalty over loyalty, never get it confused
I got real friends and family that'll never turn their back on me for the love of the money
I got a homie that's doin' life—he can't offer me no money, he can't offer me nothin' but a friendship and a relationship
I talk to him seven days a week
So don't come to me talkin' 'bout no money shit, nigga
So if you feel some type of way about my money, we goin' to the furthest extent to protect that plate that goes in front of my son on the table, nigga
One love to all my family and friends that stayed down through all the madness
While I had to sacrifice and put it all on the line
One time for my mom and sister that never changed on me, even before I had money
Ride or die, no matter what
Dreamchasers for life, you dig?
Uh, I told niggas stop askin' me where niggas at
If you don't see 'em in the pictures with me, that mean they faded away
I got niggas I distanced myself from, we love each other, it's all love but everybody can't make it
Niggas wanna burn a bridge and expect you to send a yacht, huh? Where they do that at?

[Verse 1]
Wakin' out my sleep
It's like someone is there
'Cause this reflection can't be me
But I chauffeured myself here
'Cause

[Chorus]
My walk and my talk been different
My style and my thoughts been different
I got you but it's me I'm missin'
You'll agree, you'll get it
I think I went way too far tryna please you
I know I went way too hard tryna please you
And sanctions come with the harsh truth
And you gon' shoot your shot 'cause I armed you
But I'll be honest always towards you
I think I went went way too far

[Verse 2]
When the option's up to me
I do what I think you wanna see
Ten times out of ten
I'll make the same decision again
The aroma of you, girl, makes my obligation start to fade
Just to keep you close
I watch myself drift further just the same 'cause

[Chorus]
My walk and my talk been different
My style and my thoughts been different
I got you but it's me I'm missin'
You'll agree, you'll get it
I think I went way too far tryna please you
I know I went way too hard tryna please you
And sanctions come with the harsh truth
And you gon' shoot your shot 'cause I armed you
But I'll be honest always towards you
I think I went went too far

[Verse 3]
My reflection yells at me
Reprimanding turbulent demands
Based off pure instinct
That I may just not know who I am
Every time I'm by myself
I wonder why I can't help but misbehave
Just to keep you close
I watch myself drift further just the same 'cause (Oooh oooh)

[Outro]
You'll agree, you'll get it
I think I went way too far tryna please you

[Intro]
Ooooh, New York
Ooooh, New York

[Verse 1]
Grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
Seein' my face in lights or my name in marquees found down on Broadway

[Hook 1]
Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York

[Verse 2]
On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew, ladies work so hard
Such a meltin' pot, on the corner sellin' rock, preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge

[Hook 2]
I'mma make it by any means, I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York

[Bridge]
One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say
"Yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah!"

[Hook 3]
In New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York

[Verse 1]
You took my sadness out of context
At the Mariners Apartment Complex
I ain't no candle in the wind
I'm the board, the lightning, the thunder
Kind of girl who's gonna make you wonder
Who you are and who you've been

[Pre-Chorus]
And who I've been is with you on these beaches
Your Venice bitch, your die-hard, your weakness
Maybe I could save you from your sins
So kiss the sky and whisper to Jesus
My, my, my, you found this, you need this
Take a deep breath, baby, let me in

[Chorus]
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man

[Verse 2]
They mistook my kindness for weakness
I fucked up, I know that, but Jesus
Can't a girl just do the best she can?
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Think about it, the darkness, the deepness
All the things that make me who I am

[Pre-Chorus]
And who I am is a big-time believer
That people can change, but you don't have to leave her
When everyone's talking, you can make a stand
'Cause even in the dark, I feel your resistance
You can see my heart burning in the distance
Baby, baby, baby, I'm your man (Yeah)

[Chorus]
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man

[Outro]
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Take in the sweetness
You want this, you need this
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?

Climbin' up these walls
Don't you keep me up all night
Waitin' for your call

See the way you're taking care of your Mama
The way you’re taking care of me
The way you light up any room, girl
You're what this world should be

[Pre-Chorus]
Tomorrow, tonight, the rest of my life
I wanna be the man you want me to be
So startin' right now, girl, tell me everything you need

[Chorus]
I just wanna wake up everyday here in this bed
Never leave "I love you" left unsaid
It might take a hundred lifetimes to do
But baby, I just wanna be good as you

[Verse 2]
Girl, you’re more than just the surface
Yeah, you got that heart of gold
So when it comes to loving you, babe
No, it will never get old

[Intro]
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Yeah, she makes me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots
From blue jeans to leather
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Come on now

[Verse 1]
We'll be walking down the boardwalk
Watching them jaws drop
Ain't nobody lookin' at me
They're all too busy staring at what she ain't wearin'
Can you blame her, it's 100 degrees

[Verse 2]
Yeah all them girls are jealous
'Cause they know all the fellas are watching her put on a show
Yeah every time they see her
They all just wanna be her
Making country boys' hearts explode

[Chorus]
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Yeah, she makes me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots
Blue jeans to leather
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Oh my my
Come on now

[Verse 3]
She get it from her mama
Back in Tullahoma
Small town, Tennessee
She wasn't made for drama
But like Nascar in Daytona
Yeah, that girl was made for me

[Chorus]
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Yeah she makes me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots
Blue jeans to leather
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Woo

[Chorus]
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Yeah, she makes me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots
Blue jeans to leather
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather

[Chorus]
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Yeah, she makes me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots
From blue jeans to leather
Yeah, my girl was made for short skirt weather
Yellow polka dots
From blue jeans to leather
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Come on now

[Verse 1]
They say don't go to bed angry
They say always kiss goodnight
Maybe there's somethin' to it
I don't know, but what if they're right
If we're gonna be forever
If it's gonna be just us
If we're gonna ride together
Turn two to one

[Chorus]
Gotta make it work, I'm not sayin' it's easy
Sometimes we get hurt, I promise I ain't leavin', yeah
There's gonna be a couple fights
Just to see who's wrong or right
If it's love we both know what it's gonna take
Work
Yeah, we can make it work

[Verse 2]
I've seen the things that happen
One side self destructs
I've seen the beautiful madness
When things erupt

[Chorus]
Gotta make it work, I'm not sayin' it's easy
Sometimes we get hurt, I promise I ain't leavin', yeah
There's gonna be a couple fights
Just to see who's wrong or right
If it's love we both know what it's gonna take
Work
Yeah, we can make it work

[Bridge]
Can't always be there for ya
Can't always be by your side
But I promise that I'm gon' love ya
'Til the day I die
'Til the day I die

[Chorus]
Gotta make it work, I'm not sayin' it's easy
Sometimes we get hurt, I promise I ain't leavin', yeah
There's gonna be a couple fights
Just to see who's wrong or right
If it's love we both know what it's gonna take
Work
Oh no, yeah, we can make it work

[Verse 1]
There's a few more churches than there are bars
A hell of a lot more trucks than there are cars
If the sun’s still hangin' in the sky
Work day still ain't done
Where I come from

[Verse 2]
You bow your head and pray before you eat
There ain’t a single stranger on the streets
There's a lot of nowhere towns out there
But for me there's only one
Where I come from

[Chorus 1]
So if I just won't turn down on a Saturday night
And if I never learn how to back down from a fight
And if I take my hat off for the stars and the stripes
And If I just can't seem to shut it down
That's just my "where I come from" comin' out

[Verse 3]
When I shake your hand I'm gonna look you in the eye
And if I’m wrong, I’ll apologize
I'm still tryin’ to live by a couple things I pick up
Where I come from

[Chorus 2]
So if I like my music just a little too loud
And I got a couple tattoos to show my Georgia pride
And if what's on my mind is what's comin' out my mouth
And If I just can’t seem to shut it down
That's just my "where I come from" comin' out

[Bridge]
Got a lot of good, got a little bit of bad from it
Made me what I am, got everything I have from it

[Chorus 1]
So if I just won't turn down on a Saturday night
And if I never learn how to back down from a fight
And if I take my hat off for the stars and the stripes
And If I just can't seem to shut it down
That's just my "where I come from" comin' out
"Where I come from" comin' out

[Verse 1]
Remember when ninth grade was about gettin' laid
Skippin' class tryin' not to get caught?
Now you gotta take a test in a bullet proof vest
Scared to death that you might get shot
It's like I just closed my eyes
Everybody started fallin' for the Devil's disguise
That hides behind the lies
That hide the truth and I just can't take it no more

[Chorus]
So wake me up from this American bad dream
Is it this messed up, or is it really reality?
I'm becomin' numb to all of this tragedy
Somebody wake me up from this American bad dream
From this American bad dream

[Verse 2]
I remember goin' 10 over the limit would just get you a ticket
Just an inconvenience gettin' stopped
Bad cops played the jury, made the good ones worry
About showin' up and doin' their job
It's like I just closed my eyes
Everybody started fallin' for the Devil's disguise
That hides behind the lines
That hide the truth now I just can't take it no more

[Chorus]
So wake me up from this American bad dream
Is it this messed up, or is it really reality?
I'm becomin' numb to all of this tragedy
Somebody wake me up from this American bad dream
Yeah this American bad dream
From this American bad dream, oh

[Bridge]
It's like I just closed my eyes
Everybody started fallin' for the Devil's disguise
Damn

[Chorus]
So wake me up from this American bad dream
Is it this messed up, or is it really reality?
I'm becomin' numb to all of this tragedy
Somebody wake me up from this American bad dream
From this American bad dream
Wake me up, wake me up
Wake me up from this American bad dream
From this American bad dream

[Verse 1]
Life was just breathin' in and out
Like a movie with the sound turned down
It felt nothin’ like I feel right now
You said "hello" and set the room on fire
Like technicolor in a jet black night
Suddenly the sky's never been so clear
Hey what you doin' in a thousand years?

[Chorus]
If life’s just wakin' up to
Another day of lookin' at you
If all we get is just to be together
It makes me wanna live forever
You make me wanna live forever

[Verse 2]
You tell yourself that you'll never grow old
'Til you find the hand you were meant to hold
Now I never wanna see you one last time
I never wanna know a kiss goodbye

[Chorus]
If life's just wakin' up to
Another day of lookin' at you
If all we get is just to be together
It makes me wanna live forever
You make me wanna live forever

[Verse 3]
If life’s just more of the same
Makin’ you smile, sayin' your name
If all we get is just to be together
You make me wanna live forever

[Chorus]
If life’s just wakin' up to
Another day of lookin' at you
If all we get is just to be together
It makes me wanna live forever
You make me wanna live forever
You make me wanna live forever
You make me wanna live forever

[Intro]
I saw you dancin'
You moved like Sinatra
On speed

[Verse]
The lights were a-flashin'
And tongues were a-waggin'
Over you
It's too late for tryin'
It's too late for denyin'
All those little things
You and me have done
I'm sorry, hon'
I was hopin' for a recall
A mix of you high from the sun
Oh, but nothin'
Only lone magpies come

[Outro]
I saw you dancin'
You moved like Sinatra
On speed
One, one, one

Talkin' in my sleep at night
Makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out
Hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
Oh, he makes me feel like nobody else
Nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me
So I tell myself, I tell myself

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him
You ain't getting over him
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushin' forwards
But he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standing back from it
I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)
But my love, he doesn't loves me
So I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him
You ain't getting over him
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna' learn it by heart
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it 'cause I (I, I, I)

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him
You ain't getting over him

I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em (baby you know I count 'em)
I've gotta tell them to myself
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
You ain't getting over him

[Intro]
Do, do
Ah, ah
I said

[Chorus]
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me

[Verse 1]
He’s a walk with the past
Love of the fast
Girls in the fast lane
His knuckles are brass
A heart like a horse
Love of the games, gold in his veins

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Met him at the club
Singing my songs
He says, "Are you famous?"
I was once
A b-movie actress
Has been, but never was
He knows that it's love

[Verse 2]
He saw me on stage
Pointed my way
The look of desire, all on his face
I gave him the eye
And took my place
I could tell that he'd be mine by daytime

[Chorus]
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can’t stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me

[Verse 3]
He's a man with a cast
Cane and a glass
Rim full of champagne, looking for class
A mind like a steel cage
Soul full of rage
Tactical nature so they call him insane

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Met him at the club
And from that night on
He called me his princess, right on!
I'm his little ex-beauty queen
Never going back to where I've been

[Chorus]
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can't stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it’s wrong but no one can save me

[Bridge]
No one can save me
Oh, do, do, woah
When did I ever care
What they said about our love, my baby
My baby boo

Yo, our friends think it’s sad
Living so bad
I'm always crying
He’s always mad
Our life is a mess
Oh it's a shame
What did they see in each other?", they say

[Pre-Chorus 2 - Variation]
I met him at the club
And from that night on
Called me his princess, right on!
I'm his little ex-beauty queen
Never going back to where I've been

[Chorus]
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can’t stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can't stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me

[Outro]
No one can save me
No one can save me

[Chorus]
Once you say hello to her, it's over
Once you say hello to her, it's over
Once you say hello to her, it's over
Luh, luh, love
Once you say hello to her, it's over
Once you say hello to her, it's over
Once you say hello to her, it's over
Then you’ll try hard to decide should you strap in for the ride of your life

[Verse]
'Cause it all starts out so perfect
'Cause you feel you both deserve it
So you try hard to decide
Should you strap in for the ride of your life
And before you even notice
You're super deep in motion
And then you'll question if shes worth it
And if her lovin' serves its purpose anymore

[Chorus]
Ooh, once you say hello to her, it's over
Bah n' da
Once you say hello to her, it's over, over
Once you say hello to her, it's over, over
(You might as well say goodbye)
Once you say hello to her, it's over, over
(Before you even say hello)
Once you say hello to her, it's over
And you'll try hard to decide, should you strap in for the ride of your life

[Outro]
Once you say hello to her its over, over (over scat)
(Goodbye!)
(How you doing?!)
Ahh, ohh lord
Ahh
There's something about your love
That I shouldn't publicly speak of
These feelings were discovered because
You're everything that made up my love

Curious wide awake
But you're the only one in my dreams
I believe we were meant to be

You said that you needed me
Turns out you're deceiving me
Practice what you preach is key
You did what you had to do
Possible reality is seeping through
I'm just a millimeter from leavin' you
It's so bad, but there's something about your love

There's something about your love
There's something about your love
There's something about your love
(Musical Interlude)

Curious wide awake
But you're the only one in my dreams
I believe we were meant to be

You said that you needed me
Turns out you're deceiving me
Practice what you preach is key, oh
You did what you had to do
Possible reality is seeping through
I'm just a millimeter from leavin' your ass
It's so bad, but there's something about your love

There's something about your love
There's something about your love
There's something about your love
There's something about your love

(Guitar Solo)

Da-da-da-da-da-day
Woah-oh-oh-oh-no-nay
Da-da-da-da-da-noo

There's something about your love
There's something about your love
There's something about your love
There's something about your love
There's something about your love
There's something about your love
There's something about your love
There's something about your love
Bah-dap-bah-dap-pah

[Verse 1]
Yesterday's gone by
I procrastinate to cry
Askin' God why
I needed this to happen
What's said is said and done is done
I don't know when I'll see the sun
When drowning in life's deepest sea
My cookie crumble under me

[Chorus]
That's just how my story goes
And I won't, won't look back
Won't look back
Won't look back
Won't look

[Verse 2]
I focused on the parts that died
But not the parts of me that survived
I have to learn new ways to fly
Why'd I need this to happen?
As I'm joggin' through the fiery flames
And tryna save what still remains
I'm drowning in life's deepest sea
My cookie crumble under me

[Outro]
That's just how my story goes
And I won't look back
Won't look back
Won't look back
Won't look

[Chorus]
The reds and the yellows and the orange and the purple and the greens
With the indigo the turquoise the brown and the blues and the pinks
The greys and the black and the whites you gotta feel 'em in your soul
With the mattes the metallics show reflections like the silver and the gold
The reds and the yellows and the orange and the purple and the greens
With the indigo the turquoise the brown and the blues and the pinks
They greys and the black and the whites you gotta feel 'em in your soul
With the mattes the metallics show reflections like the silver and the gold

[Verse 1]
They need to convince 'em
That I am who I claim to be on this glorious mission
Open your heart, listen to part of the vision
They never seen nothing like 'em, the diamonds is missing
And when I'm feeling soft, the sounds'll be harder than this shit;
Different
And when I feel a wave
I just go with the colours and feeling the shade
Intuition got me listening, decisions made
Over for nymphos so divine that I just can't explain
There are no words for these lights that pave the way
But at the end of the night the colours save the day
Trust your gut, it'll never let you go astray
I open my eyes and I see black
Figure out how I feel then convert it to rap
The colours yelled at me don't let nothing hold you back
Eight times out of ten I walk with a sword
'Cause I just hear the voice of god and get a scope for the board
And move accordingly to what is going on
Supreme gods, mother nature plus the four on the floor
All are lying and a nigga trying to throw me to court
And then pull me to safety for more stories to tell
Dark isn't always bad, light ain't always well
Some things pretty from the outside came straight from hell
So I don't treat these people like they mean me well
Until I hear it from the colours 'cause it's hard to tell
Until I hear it from the colours, the colours themself
The colours be the codes to the truth I am eyeing
I'mma play me on the risk here to see if I'm lying
This is the colors

[Chorus]
The reds and the yellows and the orange and the purple and the greens
With the indigo the turquoise the brown and the blues and the pinks
The greys and the black and the whites you gotta feel 'em in your soul
With the mattes the metallics show reflections like the silver and the gold
The reds and the yellows and the orange and the purple and the greens
With the indigo the turquoise the brown and the blue and the between
They greys and the black and the whites you gotta feel 'em in your soul
With the mattes the metallics show reflections like the silver and the gold

[Verse 2]
Uh
I never saw a new colour but surely I felt a few
So if you die tonight, we'll say that no one is helping you
Focus on the hue of inner you feelin'
Melting through the ice around the cold heart
Spread love, go hard
'Cause this life ain't what we think it is
I ain't got it all figured out but I'm closer than kid
I think you should take advice from him
Dude who learnt more in real world than they learn from school
If you speak the colours you see the truth
And if you see the colours then add two plus two
Common sense and intuition and let them brew
Add a little honey and you can see how sweet life can be
And that's how man communicates with species
And that's how man communicates with land under the season
And that's how the man communicates to yet exceed
And that's how man understands that throwing his threes is how a

[Chorus]
The reds and the yellows and the orange and the purple and the greens
With the indigo the turquoise the brown and the blues and the pinks
The greys and the black and the whites you gotta feel 'em in your soul
With the mattes the metallics show reflections like the silver and the gold
The reds and the yellows and the orange and the purple and the greens
With the indigo the turquoise the brown and the blue and the between
They greys and the black and the whites you gotta feel 'em in your soul
With the mattes the metallics show reflections like the silver and the gold
Hey there what's your name?
We seem to be going the same way
So do you wanna join my one man band?
Do you wanna join me?
Cause don't nobody seem to understand
And they all are kinda noisy

Tell me where you've been
Since the time I realized
It looks good from the outside
Show me the state of mind
Do you wanna join my one man band?
Do you wanna join me?
Cause don't nobody seem to understand
And they all are kinda noisy

All I have is my heart in my hand
So do you wanna join me?
Do you wanna join my one man band?
Do you wanna join me?
Hey there what's your name?
Once again it slipped my mind
Da da da
Only if you have the time
Do you wanna join my one man band?
Do you wanna join me?
Don't nobody seem to understand
They all are kinda noisy

Do you wanna join my one man band?
Do you wanna join me?
Cause all I have is my heart in my hand
Do you wanna join me?
With all the times we cried
And all the times I tried
I still don't think you're mine

With all the times we cried
And all the times I tried
I still don't think you're mine
I still don't think you're fine

With all the times we cried
All the times we died
All the times you lied
And all the times the times
I still don't think you're mine
I still don't think you're mine

With all the times we cried
With all the times you lied
I still don't think you're mine
I still don't think you're mine
All the times we cried
All the times we died
I still don't think you're fine
Still don't think you're fine
And all the times
Threece!

The way you hold my hand
And tell me I'm your man
I don't think you're mine
I don't think you're mine

The way you hold my hand
And tell me I'm your man
I just don't think you're mine
I just don't think you're fine

The way we spend the day
You say you want my name
But I just don't think you're mine
Just don't think you're mine

The way you dance with me
Just dance with me
And I just, just don't think you're mine
I just don't think you're mine
The way you look at me
The way you know my name
I just don't think you're mine

[Verse 1]
Tell me girl where do you spend your lovin' is it worth it?
I'm the one asking but you should be answering to yourself so be certain
'Cause if you don't carry yourself as good as you look it is all worthless

[Chorus]
She can move her ass but can she move her mind?
I will take the risk and we'll find out in time
I'll put my chips in, hopefully the stars align
She can move her ass but can she move her mind?

[Verse 2]
What do you do, when the thing that you love is the thing that's killing you
Do you learn from your mistakes or are you symmetrical
Sex is easy, I know you please me, but what books can you read me?
(?)

[Pre-Chorus]
Does she chase the dream or does she chase the cream?
Ain't woman go to waste like a tic tic queen
Does she chase the dream or does she chase the cream?
Ain't woman go to waste like a tic tic queen

[Chorus]
But can she move her mind?
I will take the risk and we'll find out in time
I'll put my chips in, hopefully the stars align
She can move her ass but can she move her mind?

[Outro]
Tell me girl where do you spend your love?
She can move her ass but can she move her mind?
I will take the risk and you'll find out in time
I'll put my chips in, hopefully the stars align
She can move her ass but can she move her mind?

[Verse 1]
Like a baby's vocabulary grows over time
You gave me a new way to fill up mine
With you it's kinda hard to recognize the feelings is there
'Cause it's like looking at yourself in the mirror
You've seen yourself everyday
I've seen you way clearer

[Pre-Chorus]
No your situation, won't push me away
I'm way too invested in your love
While I'm paying close attention to the words that you say

[Chorus]
Do you really like me?
Is it just the sex?
Either way I'll be back (Yeah)
Tomorrow or the next

[Verse 2]
The desire to be wanted is something that keeps us going
I was kiss how our love overflowing
I freeze the frame and observe the moment, that i leave and in your pillows
I can't tell if you play this little game called denial
'Cause love these days has gone out of style

[Pre-Chorus]
No your situation, won't push me away
I'm way too interested in your fun
Eating words off the conveyor belt while I wait

[Chorus]
Do you really like me?
Is it just the sex?
Either way I'll be back (Yeah)
Tomorrow or the next

[Verse 3]
Depending on how I see the age difference can't hold us back down
But we wouldn't wanna go and do that now
You have had a long day come relax now
You don't wanna get that close then I'll take it
And let you wear me on your arm like a bracelet

[Pre-Chorus]
No your situation, won't push me away
Diamond encrusted honesty
Because every time we lay down, you keep on your wedding ring

[Chorus]
Do you really like me?
Is it just the sex?
Either way I'll be back (Yeah)
Tomorrow or the next

[Verse]
It's so sad that you have taken
Something that I can't have back
Just because I'm black
Just because I'm black
I must have been born with a bullseye
Flat on my back I don't know why
I'm so tired because I've been waiting
For justice to be served for me
Victim of this burglary
And something's wrong with that
I wonder what their people say
That's who they're learnt from anyway
Spilled my cold blood on the pavement
Watching my life slip away
Is this really happening
Just because I'm black
I'll get to speak to you someday
What made you think that was okay?
Still I went to all the hearings
As the ghost they couldn't see
Wondering if they'd honor me
That was too much to ask
But you know in this world that we live
It's hard for people with my color skin

[Outro]
So rest deep in peace
Niggerman, niggerman
Niggerman, niggerman
Working all your life
To be robbed of your chances to have any chances

[Spoken Word: Roger Taylor]
A-one, two, three, four

Do-be-de-pie, do-be-de-pie, do-be-de-doo

[Intro]
So let's get started
I’m ready to be heard

In a perfect situation
I'd have told you long ago
But now I think it's time
You ought to know

[Pre-Chorus]
So let me tell you
Right here and now

And I will tell you how

[Chorus]

To stand on hallowed ground
But know you'll be protected
As long as I'm around

[Bridge]
To ensure there's no confusion
I would like to make it clear
If you need my help
I promise I’ll be here

[Pre-Chorus]
So let me tell you
Right here and now
I’m gonna love you
And I will tell you how

[Chorus]
I'll give you my heart

You're talking to me

Only time we get rough, baby, when I'm fucking it up, giving you all that real love
Putting in overtime, working real hard

It's not always 'bout the diamonds or the ice that I buy
It's just a little milestone for a lifetime

If your rhythm is the same how are you chanting
Try to wait for you but loneliness can be demanding

If your rhythm is the same how are you chanting
Try to wait for you but loneliness can be demanding

If your rhythm is the same how are you chanting
Try to wait for you but loneliness can be demanding
"Hi Brad, it's Mom! I just want to let you know I just finished listening to every song on your album, and you guys are extremely talented. I loved it! I loved all of it. My favorite one was 'The Artist', my favorite song. And I loved the way each song fades, at the end it fades into the next one. Very clever. So that's an official critique from your mother."
Woah woah
Woah woah
Woah woooah

Give me pills
Give me a drink
TV or a magazine
Too much is
Better than nothing
For Christ's sake
Just give me something to
To keep me distracted
Keep my mind off debt
Keep my mind occupied till it's nice and fried and there's nothing left

Open the vein
Plug me in
Entertainment information
Shut the blinds
Lock the door
How do you like it?
More more more
More answers than there's things to ask
History's just a thing of the past
The whole world's at my fingertips
And it all exists to
Keep me distracted
Keep me hanging on
As long as I get some satisfaction then
Who cares what's really going on?
Time to say goodbye to all my friends
I'm getting ready for the end
I’ll remember every song I ever heard
Every chord and every word

(Oooh ooooh)

[Verse 1]
I've been watching you walk
I've been learning the way that you talk
The back of your head is at the front of my mind
Soon I'll crack it open just to see what's inside your mind

[Chorus]
Inside your mind

[Verse 2]
Maybe I will wait until you're fast asleep
Dreaming things I have the right to see
Maybe you are dreaming you're in love with me
The only option left is look and see

[Chorus]
Inside your mind
Inside your mind

[Verse 3]
I can show you the photographs of you getting on with life
I've had dreams where there's blood on you
All those dreams where you're my wife

[Outro]
Inside your mind
Inside your mind
Inside your mind
Inside your mind

[Part I: The Man Who Married a Robot]

[Spoken Word: Siri (British Male)]
This is a story about a lonely, lonely man. He lived in a lonely house. On a lonely street. In a lonely part of the world. But, of course, he had the internet. The internet, as you know, was his friend — you could say, his best friend. They would play with each other every day, watching videos of humans doing all sorts of things: Having sex with each other; Informing people on what was wrong with them and their life; Playing games with young children at home with their parents

One day, the man — whose name was @SnowflakeSmasher86 — turned to his friend, the internet, and he said, “Internet, do you love me?”

The internet looked at him and said, “Yes. I love you very, very, very, very, very, very much. I am your best friend. In fact, I love you so much that I never, ever want us to be apart ever again ever’
‘I would like that,” said the man. And so they embarked on a life together. Wherever the man went, he took his friend. The man and the internet went everywhere together, except of course the places where the internet could not go. They went to the countryside. They went to birthday parties of the children of some of his less important friends. Different countries. Even the moon. When the man got sad, his friend had so many clever ways to make him feel better. He would get him cooked animals and show him the people having sex again, and he would always, always agree with him. This one was the man’s favorite, and it made him very happy. The man trusted his friend so much. “I feel like I could tell you anything,” he said, on a particularly lonely day

“You can. You can tell me anything. I’m your best friend. Anything you say to me will stay strictly between you and the internet.”

And so he did. The man shared everything with his friend: All of his fears and desires; All of his loves, past and present; All of the places he had been and was going, and pictures of his penis. He would tell himself, “Man does not live by bread alone.”

And then he died
In his lonely house
On the lonely street
In that lonely part of the world

You can go on his Facebook

[Part II: Love Theme]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Angela
She wears it like a dress
A post-traumatic mess

[Verse 2]
And don't sleep
It hurts to be awake
The things they make her take
Angela, Angela

[Verse 3]
Oh, we don’t speak
She stayed an extra week
Oh, I see her in my sleep
Angela, oh Angela

[Part I: How to Draw]
I've not learned how to draw
I've not learned how to draw
What if you die with all of the cameras?

[Part II: Petrichor]
Take something and then make it brand new
Try and do anything fourteen times
Love yourself like someone you love, one you love
Don't take any of my advice (My advice)
Write a letter to your future self who won't change
Don't let the internet ruin your time
They can take anything as long as it's true
What they can't take is you telling them lies, lies, lies, lies

[Chorus]
Put all your stuff in a box in my room
I don't wanna write no song about you
But you show up in everything that I do
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Since you've been gone, ain't got nothin' to do
I sleep until noon, I wake up and feel bad
I think I miss somethin' I never had
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Refrain]
I just wanna unwind, unwind
Everything that makes me feel confined
Sometimes I hate sunshine
Sometimes I hate sunshine

[Chorus]
Put all your stuff in a box in my room
I don't wanna write no song about you
But you show up in everything that I do
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Now it's a cold war, who will call first?
Try to be productive at work, I just can't
I miss you a lot, but I ain't comin' back
Ooh, ooh-ooh (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Refrain]
I just wanna unwind, unwind
Everything that makes me feel confined
Sometimes I hate sunshine
Sometimes I hate sunshine

[Chorus]
Put all your stuff in a box in my room (Room)
I don't wanna write no song about you (You)
But you show up in everything that I do (Do)
Ooh, ooh-ooh (Ayy, ayy)

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
All your love letters and a pair of Ray-Bans
I'm growin' my beard, movin' back in my van
And your side of the bed still smells like you though
And these memories of us, it's brutal
You know, you know exactly how I feel
We broke up, but you be on my mind still
And the worst type of sadness you could have
Is when you miss somethin' that doesn't miss you back

[Chorus]
Put all your stuff in a box in my room (Room)
I don't wanna write no song about you (You)
But you show up in everything that I do (Do)
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Intro]
'Cause after the afterparty, we’re gonna keep it goin'

I think it’s almost 4 AM but baby I'm still feeling just fine

So everyone say, "We don’t wanna stop!"

[Chorus]
’Cause after the afterparty, we're gonna keep it goin’

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We're all in love
We're all in love

[Verse 2]
I'm hangin' on my best friend's couch and my clothes are all on the floor
I got glitter in my underwear like it was Studio 54, yeah
I can't remember why I love it, but I need it baby, clap bring on the encore
Let's pour another drink, the glasses go
Yeah, we're always up for one more

[Pre-Chorus]
Uh huh, uh huh, we're all in we're all in love
So everyone say, "We don't wanna stop!"

[Chorus]
'Cause after the afterparty, we're gonna keep it goin'

We're all in, we're all in love, yeah
'Cause after the afterparty, we're gonna keep it goin'
We're gonna rip it up, we do it through the AM

[Verse 1]
Just a pretty girl on a TV screen
Stuck inside a silver cage
Body tangled up in chains
Looking for the light in the misery
Trapped behind the windowpane
Everyday I feel the same
Close to giving up, giving everything
Struggling for air, I'm blue
Fucking with my head, confused
Sick and tired of drinking your sympathy
Fighting back, not gonna lose
It's true, I'm through, flying with you

[Chorus]
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, will you ever regret me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Promise, baby, that you will never forget me

[Verse 2]
Breaking down the doors, I'm invincible
See if you could stop me now
Super heroine, no doubt
Treating me like I was invisible
Thought that you could shut my mouth
But now I'm gonna burn you out

[Chorus]
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, will you ever regret me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Promise, baby, that you will never forget me

[Bridge]
I want to get out of here
I want to get out of here
We're breaking up, I'm breaking down (Woah-oh-oh)
I want to get out of here
I want to get out of here
I'm moving on, we're over now, over now (Oh!)

[Chorus]
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, will you ever regret me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Promise, baby, that you will never forget me

[Chorus: Young Thug (with Shiloh Dynasty & 6LACK)]
You said no interest (Tsh-tsh-ah)
Said you found a better climax (Tsh-tsh-ah)
You said he's swagged out (Tsh-tsh-ah), you leave (Tsh-tsh-tsh)
It's like a shot to the back (Tsh-tsh-ah)
Through the nose of a barrel (Tsh-tsh-tsh)
For you don't want to go (Tsh-tsh)
But leave, like it's nothing (Tsh-tsh-ah)
You said no interest, said you found a better climax
You said he's swagged out, you leave
It's like a shot to the back
Through the nose of a barrel
For you don't want to go
But leave, like it's nothing
(We got London On Da Track)

[Verse 1: 6LACK]
I just be watching my words (Words)
You say whatever the fuck (Fuck)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Hu-uh, hu-uh, she r-i-i-ide

Bitch it's pimpin' can't you tell? (Yeah)
This is pimpin', can't you tell? (Yeah)
This shit look fishy, I don't wanna see
Emergency, I'm tryna go to sleep
Money cut down a load of trees
Sauvage Dior, this ain't no Creed
My dog got a deal, he back on the street
This bitch is so real, she as bad as can be
I had bitches around they was backstabbing me
I went straight to the racks like a hemi in me
Good energy, I invest in my queen
I can ride on this hoe like a new 12 speed
My bitch, bad, tragedy
Bitch, bad, tragedy

[Chorus: Young Thug & Shiloh Dynasty]
You said no interest (Tsh-tsh-ah)

[Intro]
Better
Nothing, baby
Nothing feels better
I'm not really drunk, I never get that fucked up
I'm not, I'm so sober

[Verse 1]
Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are
(Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are)
I'm good on the side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark
(I'm good on the side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark)
No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored
(No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored)
'Cause I live down the street
So we meet when you need and it's yours
All I hear is...

[Chorus]
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I'll admit
Nothing feels better than this

[Verse 2]
You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around
(You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around)
You keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feeling it now?
(You keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feeling it now?)
'Cause I am
I got so high the other night, I swear to God, felt my feet lift the ground

Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like

[Outro]
Nothing feels better than this

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
A day in a life of a kid in America
Everyone's a critic, watch them criticize your character
Everybody watching ya
People love to stare at ya
Everybody's greedy ain't nobody tryna share with ya
Our leaders are embarrassing
I think they need some parenting
Tell me why they playing with the fire and the kerosene?
Kids on the Percocet, trippin' on the medicine
Call it like I see ya we some drugged up Americans
Everybody's following
Ain't nobody leading
People lovin' guns more than kids is the season
And they say the reason is to protect their freedom
But we don't believe 'em

[Chorus]
'Cause all that we are
All that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
And all that we have
All that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
That's all that we are
That's all that we are
That's all that we are
Is big, big love
Is big, big love

[Verse 2:  Taboo]
When I was a young boy
Used to hear the people say
Power to the people but we them people nowadays
We ain't never giving up
Now we got our hands up
We can't breathe, cause their hearts ain't big enough
All we need is just us, hate got ya guessing
War is the answer but really, what's the question?
Money got 'em stressin'
Fear got 'em flexin'
Phones got us zoned out
Now we lose connection, please stand by
It takes you and I to keep the hope alive
'Cause we're living in a time where you're fighting to survive
And all we need is love

[Chorus]
All that we are
All that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
All that we have
All that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
That's all that we are
That's all that we are
That's all that we are
Is big, big love
Is big, big love

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap]
Life is a blessing
Knowledge is a weapon
You should choose love instead of being reckless
Candle in the darkness, hope changes the heartless
Here's love to guide you, I'll be there regardless
Situation global, we're like in a rowboat
Swimming up the river, so I can deliver
Messages to masses, no matter your status
Nothing's ever over, we believe in second chances
Many people dying, governments are lying
Stand for our rights and please no more violence
Talk with the kindness, together we're united
When we are one
Nothing can divide us

[Chorus]
All that we are
All that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
All that we have, all that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
All that we are
All that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
All that we have, all that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
That's all that we are
That's all that we are
That's all that we are
Is big, big love
Is big, big love

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Go down
Soft sound
Midnight
Car lights
Playing with the air
Breathing in your hair
Go down
Soft sound
Step into your skin? I'd rather jump in your bones
Taking up your mouth so you breathe through your nose
Home

Home
Home
Home
Home
Home
Home
Take me home

Just do it right
Make it perfect and real
Because it's everything
No everything was never the deal

So grab your things and stumble into the night
So we can shut the door on terrible times
No

Yeah, do it right
And head again into space
So you can carry on
And carry on, and fall all over the place
This is the trick, forget a terrible year
And we can shut the door until it gets weird

And this is what you waited for
But under lights, we’re all unsure
So tell me
What would make you feel better?

As night has such a local ring
And love and rock are fickle things
And you know it
Yeah, you know it
Yeah, you know

Take

Forget your past
This is your last chance now
And we can break the rules
Like fuck all will last

You might forget
Forget the sound of James' voice
Though you should not forget
Yeah, don't forget
All the shit that we laughed about
And after rolling on the floor
And thankfully, a few make sure that you get home
And you stay home
’Cause you better

'Cause you're afraid of what you need
Yeah, you're afraid of what you need
If you weren't
I don't know what we'd talk about

Yeah, no one ever knows what you're talking about
So I guess you’re already there
And no one opens up when you scream and shout
So it’s time to make a couple things clear

If you're afraid of what you need
If you’re afraid of what you need
Look around you, you're surrounded
It won't get any better

And so say goodnight

I Want Your Love

What am I gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna?
What am I gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna?
What am I gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna?

What am I gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna?
What am I gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna?
I can't kick this feeling when it hits
Do you feel like you ever want
To try my love and see how well it fits?
Baby, can’t you see what you do to me?
I can't kick this feeling when it hits
All alone in my bed at night
I grab my pillow and squeeze it tight
I think of you and I dream of you
All of the time, what am I gonna do?

I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I need your love
I'll share my dreams and make you see
How really bad your love I need
I want your love, I need your love
Just like the birds need sky above
I'll share my dreams and make you see
How really bad your love I need

[Verse 1]
Fear fun, fear love
Fresh out of fucks forever
Tryin' to be stronger for you
Ice cream, ice queen
I dream in jeans and leather
Live stream, I'm sweet for you

[Chorus]
Oh God, miss you on my lips
It's me, your little Venice bitch
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss

[Post-Chorus]
You're in the yard, I light the fire
And as the summer fades away
Nothing gold can stay
You write, I tour, we make it work
You're beautiful and I'm insane
We're American-made

[Verse 2]
Give me Hallmark
One dream, one life, one lover
Paint me happy in blue
Norman Rockwell
No hype under our covers
It's just me and you

[Chorus]
Oh God, miss you on my lips
It's me, your little Venice bitch
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss

[Post-Chorus]
You're in the yard, I light the fire
And as the summer fades away
Nothing gold can stay
You write, I tour, we make it work
You're beautiful and I'm insane

[Verse 3]
You heard my baby's back in town now
You should come, come over
We'll be hanging around now
You should come, come over

[Chorus]
Oh God, I love him on my lips
It's me, your little Venice bitch
Touch me with your fingertips
It's me, your little Venice bitch

[Verse 4]
Back, back in the garden
We're getting high now because we're older
Me myself, I like diamonds
My baby, crimson and clover

Jealous of your love

Jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be
Jealous of your love
Mommy thinks im weird

Daddy knows whats on my mind
Lucy's too insane
Lucy’s too insane for me
Mary's more my type
Mary knows what's right for me

I’ve been acting dumb
I've been acting dumb all day
Give me something nice
Let me push the past away
I don't wanna die
I just wanna close my eyes
Give me something nice
I wanna go away for awhile
Can't come back
Had a heart attack
I'm a good man
On a different track
You do see
You don't wanna see
But you do see
That's what bothers me

Can't come back
Had a heart attack
I'm a good man
On a different track
You do see
You don't wanna see
But you do see
That's what bothers me

Can't come back
Had a heart attack
I'm a good man
On a different track
You do see
You don't wanna see
But you do see
That's what bothers me

[Intro]
Uh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse: 1 Mac Miller]
I came through whippin' somethin' clean like a bald head
Bitch with me drop dead gorgeous, plus she well read
I'ma get brain on the plane if it's overnight
I'ma maintain in the game, I ain't overnight
Colder than some polar ice, or like the ghost on poltergeist
Opinions suck, I know I'm nice, money talks, you overpriced
I'm doper, fuck a sober life, you local, you ain't smokin' right
My weed loud as Hulk Hogan fights when he rip the shirt
On the throne, you kickin' dirt, sip this purp, and spit berzerk
You a bitch, your chick a flirt, stop your crying, get to work
I talk shit, got the stats that'll back it up
My shit adding up, racking up a plaque a month
And that loud ass bass you hearin', that's the trunk
That vibration on your body, now that's a bump
You can tell us who you are, you don't have to front
You ain't a captain, you just Captain Crunch

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Came through stuntin', you came in buggin' now
I came in real, and you came through frontin'
You can hate me all you want, but you ain't doing nothin' (nothin')
All that money don't make you nothin'
Came through stuntin', you came in buggin' now
I came through real, and you came in frontin'
You can hate me all you want, but you ain't doing nothin' (nothin')
And all that money don't make you nothin'

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I rock A-P-C's, some B-A-P-E's
So many different clothing brands, I got A.D.D
Bought a big ole' crib, you can picture me in it
Just decided that the sky isn't really my limit
Somethin' cold in my cup, some weed, rollin' a blunt
Smile long, like I convinced Oprah to fuck
I think I lost my mind, need a Amber Alert
You can't talk that shit unless you stand in it first
Turn a bitch to fan, even hand her some merch
To be a legend, you gotta start out with that amateur work
And I paid my dues, walked humbly on an ego trip
Sleepin' with a freaky bitch, you was chillin', chiefin' fifth
Doin' drugs with a porno chick, watchin' porno flicks
Make her own movie and I'm scorin' it
I'll see you in hell before I see you winnin'
Did it myself, and I beat the system

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Came through stuntin', you came in buggin' now
I came in real, and you came through frontin'
You can hate me all you want, but you ain't doing nothin' (nothin')
All that money don't make you nothin'
Came through stuntin', you came in buggin' now
I came through real, and you came in frontin'
You can hate me all you want, but you ain't doing nothin' (nothin')
And all that money don't make you nothin'

[Verse: Gucci Mane]
I got thirty thousand grams in a black on black van
Tell Chapo im his number one fan
I'm at Bent Taco with a hunnit' A-bands
And you ain't gettin' no work listenin' to this money change hands
I'm tryna sow the whole block up that's my plan
We can have a gun fight like i walked and i ran
Half a mill on el tran
Sellin' (?) to make bands
Im movin kushy, you's a pussy pussy, come between friends
If my Vo try to book me, I'ma get the front end
Style sixty niggas wit' me with a 100 elf hands
Ice cubes on my wrist
Bitch, I got a Mac-10
I put her out
She got her mom like i let her back in
Its Gucci!

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Came through stuntin', you came in buggin' now
I came in real, and you came through frontin'
You can hate me all you want, but you ain't doing nothin' (nothin')
All that money don't make you nothin'
Came through stuntin', you came in buggin' now
I came through real, and you came in frontin'
You can hate me all you want, but you ain't doing nothin' (nothin')
And all that money don't make you nothin'

[Outro: Gucci]
Its Gucci
Whats happenin?
Smoke somethin
Po' up
Get you some money
Burr
Haa Squad
Shoutout to my boy Mac man
Its Gucci
You know how we rock
He ain't gettin no money
He don't need nothin'

[Verse 1: Taio Cruz]
I could dream of ways to see you
I could close my eyes to dream
I could fantasize about you
Tell the world what I believe
But whenever I'm not with you
It's so hard for me to see
I need to see a picture of you
A special picture just for me

[Chorus: Taio Cruz & Ke$ha]
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Just take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Just send a dirty picture to me
Send a dirty picture
Just send a dirty picture to me
Send a dirty picture
Picture, picture, picture, picture
Picture, picture, picture, picture for me

[Post-Chorus: Taio Cruz]
Uh
Snap
Uh
Snap

[Verse 2: Taio Cruz]
Whenever you are gone, I just wanna be with ya
Please don't get me wrong, I just wanna see a picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture

[Verse 3: Ke$ha]
Whenever you are gone, I just wanna be wit ya
Please don't get me wrong, I just wanna see your picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture

[Pre-Chorus: Taio Cruz with Ke$ha]
I could dream of ways to see you
I could close my eyes to dream
Fantasize about this with you
But the way is never seen, oh

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Just take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Just send a dirty picture to me
Send a dirty picture

And we turn up, never turn down

Her feet like they never touched the ground
I like her red, but she light brown with the perfect smile
Same smile on our first child, whoa
Wait, wait Tune you need to slow down

[Verse 3]
Lord, I don't know what I'm doin'
But you know just what I'm doin'
So with that said I'ma keep doin', keep doin' just what I'm doin'
My homies ask me how I'm doin', I can't wait to say I'm good
They say, "Be careful, she know what she doin'
But as long as you good then we good," that's my niggas
Nigga you hooked, you just don't know how happy you look

You make it look worth it, you makin' me nervous and got these hoes shook

[Intro: Sampha & Lil Wayne]
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Work out, yeah
I'm in this bitch
Yeah, was on the outside, looking in this bitch
But now I’m in this bitch
Yeah, I'm in this bitch

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi, you a genius
Looked in the mirror said
"Don't let the money come between us"
I’m loaded, loaded at my earliest convenience
But fuck 'em, I feel like I got ten middle fingers
I'm sippin', sippin' in this bitch and poppin' uppers
Girl, take this, this that shit that give a flower color
And some bitch named Wonder Woman told me not to wonder
The crumbs, you only see 'em when the cookie crumble
Real shit, nigga, my candle still lit
Had to swallow my pride, though, swear it tastes like spearmint
Big up to my nigga with a strap on 'em
I never turn my back on ’em
’Cause nigga act like they cool with ya
But a lot of these niggas be transformers
A lot of these players be bench-warmers
The game ain't easy, but it’s fair, nigga
I'mma sit in this throne so long
'Til it's a fucking rocking chair, nigga
Bad bitch play with my hair, nigga
Said, "Relax, Tune, baby don’t stress out"
But I got a lot of shit on my mind, though
She said, "Let that shit work itself out"
"Let that shit work itself out"

[Interlude 1: Lil Wayne & Sampha]
C5
Yeah, back in this bitch
Tune you left this bitch
Like you knew this bitch was gon' let your ass back in this bitch
Let it all work out, let it all work out
But ain't nobody else like you in this bitch
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out
Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Cita, you a psychic
'Cause you said there be days like this
They want a piece of me, I ain't the one that's serving slices
Please swallow, I had my share of dirty diapers
Real shit, pussy niggas on that guilt trip
It'll be on in a heartbeat
You can't hear no pussy nigga's shit skip
I fear God, never fear men
Give back, never give in
Beat odds, never beat women
Keep an open mind, let 'em peek in it
Reach highs, never reach limits
Need minds, I don't need plenty
This C5, this for BI and Left Eye, and T-Boz
When I seen Chilli at the Floyd fight
I almost asked her to creep with me
But I was young, and I held my tongue
But with that tongue, I just keep spitting
So it all worked out

[Interlude 2: Lil Wayne & Sampha]
And now I'm in this bitch
And life said, "Tune, you knew me for way too long"
I never change, you know I been this bitch
And then she said, "Let it all work out"
"Let it all work out, let it all work out" (Yeah)
"Let it all work out, let it all work out"

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi, you a monster
Looked in the mirror, but you wasn't there, I couldn't find ya
I'm lookin' for that big, old smile, full of diamonds
Instead, I found this letter you ain't finished writin'
It read, "I'm sorry for even apologizing"
I tried, compromising and went kamikaze
I found my momma's pistol where she always hide it
I cry, put it to my head and thought about it
Nobody was home to stop me, so I called my auntie
Hung up, then put the gun up to my heart and pondered
Too much was on my conscience to be smart about it
Too torn apart about it, I aim where my heart was pounding
I shot it, and I woke up with blood all around me
It's mine, I didn't die, but as I was dying
God came to my side and we talked about it
He sold me another life and he made a prophet

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Sampha & Jacida Carter]
Yeah, and he said
"Let it all work out" (Yeah)
"Let it all work out"
(I'm still in this bitch)
"Let it all work out"
(Yeah, thank God 'cause I'm still in this bitch)
"Let it all work out"
Let it all work out (Phew)
"Let it all work out"
(But he said, "Remember this:")
"Let it all work out"
"Let it all work out"
("Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch")
"Let it all work out" (Yeah)
"Let it all work out"
("And don't forget what I did this, bitch")
"Let it all work out"
("Can't even remember when I didn't, bitch")
"Let it all—"
"Let it all work out" (Yeah)
"Let it all work out"
("Now I'm out this bitch")
"Let it all work out"
("I'm out this bitch")
"Let it all—"
("And it all worked out")
Love you, Dwayne

[Intro: Crystal Torres]
Imagine, imagine

[Chorus: SIMON SAYZ]
If I coulda, brought it back
I wouldn't change a fucking thing
If I coulda, brought it back (yeah, yea yea yea yeah)
If I coulda, brought it back
I wouldn't change a fucking thing
If I coulda, brought it back
(I'ma do the same thing, I'ma do the same thing)

[Interlude]
Man, fuck college! We finna do this rap shit

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
My mind's like 5 mics, rhyme tight, fuck it
Limelight, shine bright, life short, love it
Let's fill it with experiences
Balls in my hand like the grand prize game, aiming for pocket sixes
Throw back so that, you know when I say
Back in the day, you know exactly where I go at
Expanding my vocabulary
Rapping every word off the magazine covers down at Walgreens
That's a .357 Magnum like Tackleberry
Academics took a backseat like Hightower
I flowered my power, yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus: SIMON SAYZ]
If I coulda, brought it back
I wouldn't change a fucking thing
If I coulda, brought it back (yeah, yea yea yea yeah)
If I coulda, brought it back
I wouldn't change a fucking thing
If I coulda, brought it back
(I'ma do the same thing, I'ma do the same thing)

[Interlude]
Yo, we got a contract on the table from Atlantic Records
What do you think?

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Well every rose has its thorn, and if I could be reborn
I mean to be the king, even Jesus puts 'em on
So, Atlantic ocean motion might make you sell funny
Betcha didn't know the advance went straight to bail money
That's right, to free Chilly Chill
And to do it all again, I would sign another deal
Still kinda paranoid from when they leaked my tape
Jeopardize being friendly just to keep mine safe
When keeping it real goes right, I couldn't keep my faith
By third album I was done, you shoulda seen my face
Fuck Craig, fuck rap, fuck this, fuck that
Fuck your 360 deal, nigga, that shit's wack
I was Truth.com with no backup plan
Got blackballed, couldn't find a job, tryna backup dance
That shit was crazy, thanks to my back-up fans
I guess what lawyers can't do, (we are Anonymous) the hackers can

[Chorus: SIMON SAYZ & Crystal Torres]
If I coulda, brought it back
I wouldn't change a fucking thing
If I coulda, brought it back (yeah, yea yea yea yeah)
If I coulda, brought it back
I wouldn't change a fucking thing
If I coulda, brought it back
(I'ma do the same thing, I'ma do the same thing)

[Interlude]
You wouldn't change nothin'? Like nothin'!?

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Well, that's not totally true
Young Lupe, I wish I could be totally you
But that's the way it works, came to bring the pain, that's the way it hurts
Picking in the scabs from the past just gon' make it worse
Can't be 21 every time I sit and make a verse
When I did that song with NumbaNine, I was tryna break the curse
The good don't make it out of the hood unless the hood make it out you first
All you needs just to believe that you can leave
Crown B and Es made me believe that I could lead
Righteous deeds, planting seeds for good society
So you see that I can't be totally new
Cause there's a future Lupe out there that wanna be both of me too
And nobody really knows what the future holds
All the future sins for our future souls
And what I am doing now I couldn't do before
What would you do, man, if you could go?

[Chorus: SIMON SAYZ & Crystal Torres]
If I coulda, brought it back
I wouldn't change a fucking thing
If I coulda, brought it back (yeah, yea yea yea yeah)
If I coulda, brought it back
I wouldn't change a fucking thing
If I coulda, brought it back
(I'ma do the same thing, I'ma do the same thing)

[Intro]
Turn the beat up some more
Ay-yeah-yeah, anchors

[Verse 1]
Uh, rectangle full of color
Complicated man sits, dedicated to the rudder
Under Apollo, over feeling under as a swallow, Wadjet wallows
Instead he looks for Yetis in tomorrow
And do-gooders become regretters for giving garble
At the art show out in Park Slope
Broken dancers rather flatten cardboards than work at Arco
Flippers who feat feets riff contortionists hips and grease slippers
Tweezers release slivers
From lines with deep splinters, paws for sweet skippers
Another key-figure's of East River's who eat liver and drink liquor
And root for Bird due to an unconscious urge to beat niggas
Who prefer sweet, steep sleep
And to pull hoes with the ease of police triggers
Sikhs at the hair show, Arabs at the airport
Caucasians in the projects, niggas anywhere though

[Refrain]
People lovingly exclaim
People lovingly exclaim
People lovingly exclaim
People...

[Hook]
Beauty is the largest
Obstacle to obsess
Decorate the sergeant
Community resistance in progress

[Verse 2]
Pull out game strong like the Waco Kid
But also like a lifeguard, now that don't even make no sense
But since, if the swimmers ain't got no rings on
Don't be a fag, let me stab that Yoo-Hoo with my ding-dong
Fruits of interracials, my banana's bigger than King Kong
Both ways seem wrong like nobody in China is good at ping-pong
Seem wrong?
That's evidence they shouldn't be passing their genes on
That was racist, but I'ma run with it
Like every sagging pair of pants has to have a gun in it
So I undid it, like a Singapore with gum in it
Does that mean if I let you ride it, I can put my thumbs in it?
Uhn—nasty, but let the moment pass, only wave if they ask
And catch me at the scene of the crash, karma
They hate blood like Blade
So they hate cuz like an English teacher grades

[Hook]
Beauty is the largest
Obstacle to obsess
Diaspora and sonnets
Community resistance in progress

[Refrain]
People lovingly exclaim
People lovingly exclaim
People lovingly exclaim
People...

[Verse 3]
The city: population control, occupation parole
Hope the swayed persuades and this conversation cajoles
Not to be Enron
Alexander Hamilton of Cassandra's Agamemnon
The environment is more than just a panda at the wind farm
Looks cool but it's bull as cool fusers
And the abusers fuel the dull losers
To make fools of the schools and pool Bueller's
The crusade to legislate oxygen
And put it in a box just like Desiree Washington
Fortune cookie, First Panda accelerated profit
And hope Santa fill my socks with highly-decorated moccasins
My, how the roles have reversed
So now we gotta eat 'em for dessert
Bop the kids just to free 'em from the curse
Dress up the thots in lingerie and feed 'em to Levert (uh-huh)

[Hook]
Beauty is the largest
Organize the objects
Diaspora and sonnets
Community resistance in progress

[Outro]
Diaspora and sonnets
Community resistance in progress
Woah—the people lovingly exclaim (people lovingly exclaim)
People lovingly exclaim (people lovingly exclaim)
People lovingly exclaim (people lovingly exclaim)
Community resistance in progress
Pe-pe-people lovingly exclaim (people lovingly exclaim)

[Elena Pinderhughes Flute Solo]

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Uhh, I exist, spoken in a confident voice
Can world shift and continent hoist
Look under for the plunder
A rich man's song that gets sung for a sum out the lungs of a stunner
But life turns to a station and a hustler to a hummer
Went from speaking and now not even sinking
The game is karaoke ’til it tries to punish poke me
Kinda throw me words slowly, fade degrading in the foley
Waving metal sheets make thunder
Fooling I was younger; fool me when I'm older
Fool me now, screw me down to the sofa, taking Soma
Drinking soda, eating vulture, tweeting vulgar
Playing Madden getting fat and getting cultured with the quotes
In the hopes people will get the jokes
If it rains you will get the float
But only if they're still building boats

[Interlude: Dr. Eric Thomas]
But your values system says you believe in sleep
More than you believe in grinding
Your values system says you are a consumer and not a producer
That you’re spending more money than you're making
Why? Because you're a consumer, you're reading all the books
And you're saying everything the books are saying
But those books are not in alignment with your values!
And you're gonna go to the next level
Your values are gonna have to change

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Uhh, Drunken Fist versus Praying Mantis
Was it God's plan or man mismanaged to turn New Orleans to Atlantis?
They lie in the streets to lambast
The black land swam at like a HE MAN in a bathtub
Fire! Cup up the bad blood
Hope hand tugs come right after the lackluster backrubs
Or half structured or tech hubs or wack love
That's stacked as if chance in community chest
God said, "Don’t you ruin me yet
Until I give them everything and there’s just two of these left"
Black bumper slow fades into a vista
Rapid cuts a stock footage which freezes on a listener
Give me love, lovers
I read it like blood color on the head of a flooded structure
Can't keep the duck rubber under, fundamentally it’s buoyant
It rises like court rooms to swoon for your enjoyment

[Chorus: Nikki Jean]
Every single word you said
Will you say it to me?
Well it stays with me
I heard every single word you said
Will you say it to me?
Well it stays with me, hoohh

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Trap music meets trapezoids, fake his own death
They roll rocks like asteroids to the crest
Think outside the box, I wrap a toy in a cheque
Then watch a sissy fuss with a boy in a dress
Mad at the world, in a voice of a man
With a bag of a girl, she just avoids the success
It's what he said, or what she said
Double entendre no matter how you play it
Then he takes the sex tape and destroys the cassette
And puts the ribbon in the sky like the limited of eye
Then prepares to utter, what's been a symbol in its side
Against the ticker tape scene in a Silver Lake dream
Sorta orders the lungs to unmilitate screams
Shouts to a forged son with imitate beams
In a blue sky filled with pornographic strings
Getting caught up in the trees, I still believe in Jesus!

[Interlude]
Our purpose is to ensure
That literature and art sit well
Into the whole revolutionary machine
As a component part
That they operate as powerful weapons
For uniting and educating the people
And for attacking and destroying the enemy
And that they help the people fight the enemy
With one heart and one mind

[Chorus: Nikki Jean]
Every single word you said
Will you say it to me?
Well it stays with me
I heard every single word you said
Will you say it to me?
Well it stays with me

[Outro: Bishop Edgar Jackson]
There was a man who wrote many things
But Carlyle said, um, that we could not be ruined
Because no lie could live forever
William Cullen Bryan said, "Truth crushed to earth, would rise again"
And James Russell Lowell, made it more plain
That we would not be ruined or destroyed
Because he said that, "Truth, forever on the scaffold, lies forever on the throne
But that scaffold sways the future, and behind the dim unknown
Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch, above his own"
These powerful scriptures were also used by the man
In whom we celebrate his birthday today, Dr. Martin Luther King
And Dr. King told us to practice non-violence and the power of love
Non-violence and the power of love has brought us thus far
The agape love that we have for ourselves
That we have for our people is the reason why our people
In this particular diaspora called, North America
Have not been totally ruined
We have not been totally destroyed, we have not been exterminated
So therefore, uh, my dear brother, um, Wasalu
We call you, we thank you for what you've asked me to do
And we shall continue to study to show ourselves approved under God
Workman that needn’t not be ashamed
Rightly this dividing the word of truth
And so at this time, in this city
Where young men's lives are not worth much
In this city where our people have been discriminated against
And kept from the resources which we
Rightly deserve as a majority of people in the city
We are dependent upon the most high creator of the ends of the world
That I call Elohim Jehova
And we are dependent upon him to keep us from falling
To keep us from being ruined, to keep us from being exterminated
And we thank the Almighty
For the privilege of being here with my niece
Is to impart these words
And I hope it would be of assistance in this project
God bless you and thank you

[Intro: Timbuck2]
Me and Lupe Fiasco, Hollywood, California
Palm trees, Hollywood lights, enjoy the show
Before we take it down
I need everybody in the building tonight right now
From front to back, left to right, to put both hands in the sky
Right now before we get to the next song
We got any hip-hop fans out there?
Where y'all at? Make some noise
Y’all ready for Lupe Fiasco?
Let me hear you make some fuckin' noise

[Refrain]
Say insane, insane in the brain
In the brain, I bring the pain
Yeah, I came, that's why I came
In the game to do my thang, so whatchu think?
Write my story on the wall, on the wall
On the wall, ah-all, in Hall of Fames
Got a day in the city, ooohh
Not too gangster to be dancin’ in the video
Say insane, insane in the brain
In the brain, I bring the pain
Yeah, I came, that's why I came
In the game to do my thang, so whatchu think?

[Verse 1]
See when loves comes from the center, I'm Mutombo to my members
I heard you heard that I was fly so I'm Dumbo to my listeners
Gimmie them inches I make miles out them bitches, brew
Listen, you couldn't do a mountain trial while on my intertubes
Tour de Force, tied so I am not the daddy
Had to move the club all by myself 'cause I ain't had no caddy
Gladly, didn't always have that cake but I always had a patty
Or at least a home girl like Aesha from Cincinnati
Word to Ken and Kathy, who says that we can’t be happy?
Sadly that it ain’t no joke on that block, like Laffy Taffy
Tried to trap me, dug out like a nappy snappy, even Lassie
Attacked me, tag me for grapplin' so I can get back to wrasslin’
For the love because the foundation is my heart, that's my start
Play my part, make communications with my art
Give my DJ the Serato, got that chico from my vatos
Down in Chicos in El Paso, Tapatío on my tacos

[Chorus]
Gimme the mic (whatchu want?) Gimme the mic (whatchu want?)
Gimme the mic (whatchu want?) Gimme the mic (whatchu want?)
Gimme the mic (whatchu want?) Gimme the mic (whatchu want?)
Gimme the mic (whatchu want?) Gimme the mic (whatchu want?)
Gimme the mic (whatchu want?) Gimme the mic (whatchu want?)
Gimme the mic (whatchu want?) Gimme the mic (whatchu want?)
Gimme the mic (whatchu want?) Gimme the mic (whatchu want?)
Gimme the mic (why?) Cause they ain't kickin' it right

[Verse 2]
Yeah, uhh
Doin’ them capers for the paper like I'm Superman
Past, wanna put it all behind me like a movin' van
Future, want it cuter than Karrueche Tran, Hula dance
Not like Yokozuna in booty pants, on Hoover, I do the Dam
Or at least I'm tryin', in the hopes that I see some diamonds
On a boat and a piece of mind and on a coast with a decent climate
Where dopes wanna seek refinement
And the pros wanna keep it client
And the cults wanna see my rhymin'
For the dose of the secret science (yeah)
Wade through the maze on the way
To the stage at the pace of "Amazing Grace" (okay)
And a raisin raised in the rays of the Sun
Wouldn't fade in the shade of the day (okay)
Will you lay in a cage with a snake
Gettin' flailed on the back and it nailed to the palm?
Not the nails from salons but the nails that attack
And a rusty razor blade to the face
To clear your sins? Nah
They don't want that fate, no
They won't take that place, yeah
Gotta get mine from the love from below and above in the mud
And the mind of a kind that recline, and relaxed
But design all the time like floods
If you see me from the high road, more Tzatziki on my Gyro

[Chorus]
Gimme the mic (whatchu want?) Gimme the mic (whatchu want?)
Gimme the mic (whatchu want?) Gimme the mic (whatchu want?)
Gimme the mic (whatchu want?) Gimme the mic (whatchu want?)
Gimme the mic (whatchu want?) Gimme the mic (whatchu want?)
Gimme the mic (whatchu want?) Gimme the mic (whatchu want?)
Gimme the mic (whatchu want?) Gimme the mic (whatchu want?)
Gimme the mic (whatchu want?) Gimme the mic (whatchu want?)
Gimme the mic (why?) Cause they ain't kickin' it right

[Refrain]
Say insane, insane in the brain
In the brain, I bring the pain
Yeah, I came, that's why I came
In the game to do my thang, so whatchu think?
Write my story on the wall, on the wall
On the wall, ah-all, in Hall of Fames
Got a day in the city, ooohh
Not too gangster to be dancin' in the video

[Verse 3]
Yeah, uh, uh
Happy Timbuck2 Day, in the groove you got that Lupe
And I'm smooth as Michael Bublé eatin' creme brulee and Kool-Aid
You can scroll down just like Jubei
My whole timeline got that sousei
Hard and soft when I lay it down, gotta Wu-Tang logo on my duvet
That's ying-yang, that's Baby Boy and Ving Rhames
That's the best of both worlds like God caused the Big Bang
(Mind blown) Now this might drive you insane
Keep blacks all around that waste, but don't wanna make us senseis
That's senseless, since slaves, man's like, "I don't wanna work, send slaves
On ships, on waves, in waves", okay
Colder than a goalay, golder than my Rolay
Told her hope and hold her 'lobe just like Evander Holay
That's cleaner than a solar panel, power panoramic camera
Tanner family photo album, used to smuggle cocaine
Now they don't want that beef, let that child talk like a king
Let that cow walk in the street, extra mild sauce on my wings

[Chorus]
Gimme the mic (whatchu want?) Gimme the mic (whatchu want?)
Gimme the mic (whatchu want?) Gimme the mic (whatchu want?)
Gimme the mic (whatchu want?) Gimme the mic (whatchu want?)
Gimme the mic (whatchu want?) Gimme the mic (whatchu want?)
Gimme the mic (whatchu want?) Gimme the mic (whatchu want?)
Gimme the mic (whatchu want?) Gimme the mic (whatchu want?)
Gimme the mic (whatchu want?) Gimme the mic (whatchu want?)
Gimme the mic (why?) Cause they ain't kickin' it right

[Refrain]
Say insane, insane in the brain
In the brain, I bring the pain
Yeah, I came, that's why I came
In the game to do my thang, so whatchu think?
Write my story on the wall, on the wall
On the wall, ah-all, in Hall of Fames
Got a day in the city, ooohh
Not too gangster to be dancin' in the video

[Outro: Timbuck2 & Lupe Fiasco]
We got any hip-hop fans out there?
Where y'all at? Make some noise
Got a day in the city, ooohh
Not too gangster to be dancin' in the video
Timbuck2, basically just a kid from Chicago that loves DJ'ing

[Intro: Leila Z. Braimah-Mahamah]
Aloft all hands, strike the top-masts and belay
Yon angry setting sun and fierce-edged clouds
Declare the typhoon's coming
Before it sweeps your decks, throw overboard
The dead and dying – ne'er heed their chains
Hope, hope, fallacious hope!
Where is thy market now?

[Intro]
We are a people who have historically been on the verge of extinction
Freeway
We have been at many times, under much stress
Since being brought into this country
On many, many slave ships

[Verse 1]
Preparations, reparations from segregation
Genius at Genesis, master system SEGAs
Punjabi mommy, dissecting Vedas on Sepulveda
Anointed players who coin phrases, that's metal paper
Level layers, several shades of grey and submission for it
MILF lover under silk covers who kiss her horses
Pilates central to preservin’ the body temple (oh yea)
Jazz classics combatin' the fattest ass, status
Quotient; my potions soakin' like boats in oceans
Motion sickness, I overdid all my finesse pack
Multidecker, new refreshment, lessons from jet snacks
My momma wisdom, my competition is setbacks
Jetlaggin’, very swaggered, my Jordans dirty
AMG performance, my foreign don't show no mercy
Mere products, objects, meaningless to the over-standers
Contemplatin' with industrialists and social planners
Manillas!

[Chorus]
Don't ruin us, don't ruin us, don't ruin us, don't ruin us
Don't ruin us, don’t ruin us, don’t ruin us, don't ruin us
Don’t ruin us, don't ruin us, don't ruin us, don't ruin us
Don’t ruin us, don't ruin us, don't ruin us God said

[Verse 2]
Life's work, overseeing the Five Classics
You can accomplish anything if you survive blackness
Sober living, Kosher kitchen, and co-defendants
Soda sippin', the soca rhythms, and global vision
Fear no verdict, but I feel allergic to local prisons
My new resurgence, a due return into socialism
Youth moves pay dividends as an old man
Snake-headed Mayan goddess body with gold hands
Father sins, send his twins into the underworld
Though legendary, I weapon carry for same goals
My February's is necessary to save souls
Epilepsy diamonds flicker foolish on the cuff wrist
Do my duty to be useless to the fuck shit
Manufacture finished goods to service local needs
Dashboards lack the means to show my total speeds
Fast forward florists forge orchids to go with me
Construct the future with thirty bars
Long tenures, I'm returning home to dirty cars
Jasmine necklace from a poor woman on Hindu streets
I gave her Rupees, she gave me beauty, I temple creep
Manillas

[Chorus]
Don't ruin us, don't ruin us, don't ruin us, don't ruin us
Don't ruin us, don't ruin us, don't ruin us, don't ruin us
Don't ruin us, don't ruin us, don't ruin us, don't ruin us
Don't ruin us, don't ruin us, don't ruin us God said

[Verse 3]
Roman logic, Greek prophets, and add tutors
B-more young'ns, they 12 o'clock, and then jump the scooters
Through entertainment, I end the training to run the future
Anton Chekhov my checkouts, too much for your computers
Chakra waves, singin' bowls, stirring, I'm Dalai Lama
Creation, step in my mental selection Bobby Konders
Nightmare women, dream girls, and body monsters
Don't confuse my temptation battles for batty mantras
Sole pilot til' my reputation is bodhisattva
Word to Botticelli saw Venus in this topless opera
Lost the combination need security to come and pop-a-lock'a
Still no drinkin', just bought this champagne here to watch this vodka
Punk band merchandise patches on leather coats
Tell you tales of illegal sales by fetid boats
Swallowed by waves, the hollow graves, they'll never float
Sunken ships carried slaves, tokens to western coasts
Manillas

[Chorus]
Don't ruin us, don't ruin us, don't ruin us, don't ruin us
Don't ruin us, don't ruin us, don't ruin us, don't ruin us
Don't ruin us, don't ruin us, don't ruin us, don't ruin us
Don't ruin us, don't ruin us, don't ruin us God said

[Outro]
Copper alloy bracelet forms were recognized and used for currency
As transactions from the end of 15th century to the mid 20th century
Their metal content varied from copper to brass
Most Manilla were manufactured in England or France
And like trade beads, were used for trades with Africa
The local chiefs on the slave coast of West Africa traded their human cargo
For many different commodities and the Manilla was one of them
This Manilla was manufactured in Birmingham between 1830 and 1850
Was being shipped to Africa to be bartered for one slave, each Manilla
These slaves were then packed into hulls of ships
And taken to the West Indies and the Americas
To be sold for vast profits if they did not die from the journey
The Duoro was one of the slave ships
With trade goods on her way to Africa to pick up her human cargo
When she hit a rock and sank in 1843

[Intro]
Let me tell you 'bout the 'ting
Come sit 'round the fire
Me tell you where we come from
Me tell you the story

[Verse 1]
Some men wanna live like a banker
Fill up the ship then pull up the anchor
Pay the man dem to come run and take ya
Rassclaat chain in a brainwash nature
Joggin' in y'all clothes to the tailor
Drop leg to di riddim of the maker
Mash up di boat ah di fassyhole sailor
No rain a fall pon a Babylon acre
Zinc fence but me mind is a mansion
Dem a sufferer, we still have a bashment
Him inna cross but im still be a-dancin'
Every ting cook a curry like a champion
In a jam, but the man, him a jammin'
Original, you should come follow fashion
Me already dun seen what the future hold
Nuff gold for the dark hearts and the chasms
So big up your chest
Like a skin teet in a bad man wagon
No fear, me a duppy assassin
Make a wish me a dutchie Aladdin
Wah dem i-sire for dem earthstrong?
Give thanks to the first Gong
Di man word like a bird song
Iya self me a work pon (Fyah!)
Me gon tell ya bout the nation
Gravelicious men in them wicked navigations
Small up the slaves and stuff them in arrangement
We the children of the first generation

[Pre-Chorus]
Fire burn (atat tat tat tat)

Real mumma (atat tat tat tat)
Soon forward (atat tat tat tat)
Fire burn (atat tat tat tat)

[Chorus]
All I got is gold, golden memories
When I think about what you meant to me
All I got is gold, golden memories
When I think about what you did to me
When I think about, when I think about (reparation)
When I think about, when I think about
When I think about, when I think about
When I think about, when I think about (respect)

[Verse 2]
Man dem a come down from England
And dem wah commerce for your kingdom
Say 'em got nuff Manilla for the yute
And the gal and the man, would you bring some?
Tallawah and bashy, yuh sight me?
Say him don't want the likkle or the feisty
Say him got nuff bickle for the trip
Nah worry 'bout a thing man, everyone irie
Fuckery, mi nah wan' fi do it
And the samfie man wan mi fi trade pickney
For a quattie, baldhead must think me foolish
Me put a cutlass in this nuisance
Bwoi, wake up from your dream
To the smell and the sound and the screams
And the panic of the captain and the crew
Who don't know what to do as the ship comes apart at the seams
Got 'em, ship gets pulled to the bottom
By a group of men and women holdin' ropes with large hooks
On the ends specifically designed for catchin' boats
Crew in disbelief as they choke
The weight of the chains on the slaves
Pullin' down to what they think are they graves
Afraid as they sink from the surface of the sea
'Til a soft voice in the water tells them, "Breathe"

[Pre-Chorus]
Fire burn
Fire burn (atat tat tat tat)
Babylon (atat tat tat tat)
Real mama (tat tat tat tat)
Soon forward (atat tat tat tat)
Fire burn (atat tat tat tat)

Downpressed (atat tat tat tat)
Jah bless (tat tat tat tat)

[Chorus]
All I got is gold, golden memories
When I think about what you meant to me
All I got is gold, golden memories
When I think about what you did to me

[Verse 1]
Wade with us
Baptize and convert to the waves with us
I tuned in to what the future holds
I could never be a slave, niggas
They gon' have to pay me, Navy
Downloaded by the tidals like Jay-Z
That's a roll offshore like an A.P., Davy
Jones' locker on top of those hoppers off the side of the ship
Suicide, didn't die from the dip
Submarine man, keep your eyes on the blips
Sonar, echolocation, know where we are facin'
Get back to our nation—oh, Lord!
So we walkin' back to Africa
And I found a detour to the seashore
Yes, jumped off the deck
To leave footsteps on the depths of the sea floor, ayy

[Chorus]
My bones is why the beach is white
Why the beach is white 'cause they bleached us light
So I'm goin' back home, I took a leap last night
So I'm walkin' on water 'til my feet just like Jesus Christ
Wow, walkin' on water
Wow, wow, walkin' on water
Wow, wow, walkin' on water
Wow, wow, walkin' on water, ayy
My bones is why the beach is white
Why the beach is white 'cause they bleached us light

So I'm walkin' on water 'til my feet just like Jesus Christ
Walkin' on water, wow, wow
Walkin' on water, wow, wow
Walkin' on water, ayy

[Verse 2]
Yeah, uh
Dive with us, vibe with us
Imbibe with the tide
Sea salty 'cause it cry with us when we looked it in the eyes
Like how could you help her?
Poseidon apologized and said that I'm sorry, we're shelter
Y'all can live down here forever, drownin' is severed
From all your lungs and the lungs of your sons
Tell your daughters the water's a treasure
Summon the forest
Talkin' to trees, now how could you be in the chorus
With something so horrid?
You became boards for the floors and the doors of the warships
Anthropomorphic, the forest returned with a match
Made from itself and said, "Burn us with that"
Then left again and came back with a axe
We can serve you as furniture or furnace us black, ayy

[Chorus]
My bones is why the beach is white
Why the beach is white 'cause they bleached us light
So I'm goin' back home, I took a leap last night
So I'm walkin' on water 'til my feet just like Jesus Christ
Wow, walkin' on water
Wow, wow, walkin' on water
Wow, wow, walkin' on water
Wow, wow, walkin' on water, ayy
My bones is why the beach is white
Why the beach is white 'cause they bleached us light
So I'm goin' back home, I took a leap last night
So I'm walkin' on water 'til my feet just like Jesus Christ
Walkin' on water, wow, wow
Walkin' on water, wow, wow
Walkin' on water, ayy

[Verse 3]
Yeah, shipwreck with us
Grab vessels, bring 'em down to the depths with us
Take ahold of the bow of the Jesus

Walkin' on water, ayy

[Verse 4]
Yeah, uh
Rise with us
From out the sevens to the Heavens in the skies in us
Conversations with the constellations
While you navigate the haters, black baby alligator baiters
Supposed to do greater, with all of your alphas and betas
And minors and majors
You were so busy just tryin' to shine
You shoulda been tryin' to save us
Star said, "Excuse our behavior
We will be indebted to you for all of eternity
If you counseled your heart and forgave us
Remove all our favors from childrens of sailors and slavers
Repay you with acres
But here in the heavens where harvest is greater
A meager inheritance, pardon our arrogance
Those with Americans, guide them to places much safer, ayy"

[Chorus]
My bones is why the beach is white
Why the beach is white 'cause they bleached us light
So I'm goin' back home, I took a leap last night
So I'm walkin' on water 'til my feet just like Jesus Christ
Wow, walkin' on water
Wow, wow, walkin' on water
Wow, wow, walkin' on water
Wow, wow, walkin' on water, ayy
My bones is why the beach is white
Why the beach is white 'cause they bleached us light
So I'm goin' back home, I took a leap last night
So I'm walkin' on water 'til my feet just like Jesus Christ
Walkin' on water, wow, wow
Walkin' on water, wow, wow
Walkin' on water, ayy

[Outro]
Seas, all that I have for you, forest
Fire and maps for you, stars
Fall off the flag for you, sugar
Sweeten the path for you, seas
All that I have for you, forest
Fire and maps for you, stars
Fall off the flag for you, sugar
Sweeten the path for you, seas
All that I have for you, forest
Are fire and maps for you, stars
Fall off the flat for you, sugar
Sweeten the path for you, seas
All that I have for you, forest
Are fire and maps for you, stars
Fall off the flag for you, sugar
Sweeten the path for you

[Chorus: Nikki Jean & Lupe Fiasco]
Fish is my friends and the whales is my homies
Octopuses my people, the shrimp, they all know me
The sharks is my niggas, the dolphins is with us
The crabs is my comrades, the seahorse be holdin' us down
Jellyfish, they just be rollin’ around
Lobsters is cool, they are not food
They part of the crew
And that mean they down (that mean they down)

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Life Aquatic, product of the passage, ooh
Stay there with me, lookin' like Atlantis (ayy)
We're off to build another planet (ayy)
See a ship and then we’re really goin' savage (ayy)
From the home, we was lost in the Atlantic
I wouldn't make it, but we'll find a way to manage (ayy)
Titanic when we're breakin' off the damage
I ain't gotta say it man, that wave is automatic
Me and my partnas, say your life is a beach, no
But life is a beach though
Yeah, it's down here on the sea floor (yeah)
And now we’re really gettin’ deep though
I feel I'm golden (no)
I don’t take shit from no one (no)
I just be floatin'
We're down in the ocean

[Chorus: Nikki Jean & Lupe Fiasco]
Fish is my friends and the whales is my homies
Octopuses my people, the shrimp, they all know me

Lobsters is cool, they are not food
They part of the crew
And that mean they down (that mean they down)
And that mean they down, that mean they down

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Throw us in the water, execution
We really thought we wasn't gonna do nothin'
But the sharks and the dolphins gonna do somethin'
Walked up out that water, evolution
Ayy, ayy, revolution
Pass the plate, you should make a contribution
If you ain't got it then you gotta go and get it
Climate change, chain flooded, call it sleepin' with the fishes
Tired of all these bitches, in my net it's just fishes
In my net it's just swishes, boom
And you know I'm a floater, ballin'
Coachin' from the ark, Doc Rivers, call Flipper my nigga
Say you got it for the low (low)
Say you got it by the boat (by the boat)
When you whip it in the water (whip it, whip it)
If it's real, it'll float

[Chorus: Nikki Jean & Lupe Fiasco]
Fish is my friends and the whales is my homies
Octopuses my people, the shrimp, they all know me
The sharks is my niggas, the dolphins is with us

And that mean they down (that mean they down)
And down, and down, and that mean they down

[Bridge: Lupe Fiasco]
One time for my homies at the bottom
Told some lies, keep it real for the bottom
Some of y'all ain't allowed at the bottom
9th Ward, it was down at the bottom
Katrina had it down at the bottom
Pine Ridge, it be feelin' like the bottom
Gaza Strip, baby, tough at the bottom
So you gotta give it up to the bottom
Some only really talk about the top
But I wanna talk about the bottom
I know everything got a lot
But I want them to know that I got 'em, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Nikki Jean & Lupe Fiasco]
Fish is my friends and the whales is my homies

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
(Are you scared? Are you scared?)
Uhh, turn up, turn up

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Let me flex, get up, brush sand off myself
I was just holding my breath
Blue shorts, red shirt, how I'm dressed
I look fresh, and I feel
Bleeeeeeeeeeessed
What's your name? My name Alan
Sounds like Aylan, I love smiling
I got talents, I can do flips
I can keep my balance, I love dancing
Matter of fact, can I have one?
Right now, y'all heard the man, lights out
And the moon turns into a disco ball
Heaven, better come and get your daughter
Waltzing all on top of that water
Then Whip, then Nae-Nae, then dip
Down in my submarine
I got a pair of seats
Raise the periscope, to see parakeets
And the dinosaurs don't be scaring me
I got my own personal Dairy Queen
Satisfaction is guaranteed
I'm rather dashing, apparently
Got an airplane too, won't you come fly through the air with me?
Best thing of all
My mother says that I'm very sweet
Jonylah says "It's all cool, but what about school?
And ain't you Muslim? You can't talk 'til you marry me”

[Chorus: Crystal Torres]
The waves can be your cover, the beach can be your pillow
My heart can be your house, my eyes can be your windows
To teach you how to swim and then we'll play Nintendo
Beating all of your friends, dancing to the tempo
Go Alan, go Alan
Go Alan, go Alan
Go Alan, go Alan, go Alan, go Alan
Go Alan, go Alan, go Alan, go Alan, yeah

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
And they say, yeah (now entering)
Now entering that Canadian Olympic swimming team
And those medals are just glistening, so gold
So cold, yeah
And Alan did the most, all those world records he broke
That's why his nickname is the lifeguard and my God is he dope
Michael Phelps cannot believe it even though he is his coach
He might be the next Steve Zissou, or maybe Jacques Cousteau
Where he saw that little boy, go and fall off of that boat
So he jumped off in that water swam him right back to the shore
Now ain't that wild, crowd goes wild
Little boy scared so the child won't smile
So Alan get a towel to dry him off and wipe him down
Put an ice cream out, that's more his style
Father runs down that beach
Sees his son just playin' in the sand
Hugs Alan who says he's a brave little man
Walk away little boy, turns around and waves his hand
Call Jonylah say, "Guess what I did today?
Got my rescue on saved a kid today
Had my wet suit on and my fins today
Even taught him next time how to swim away"
You should really feel good that you gave your help
Might get you into heaven, might raise your health
Might get a lot of blessings, might raise your wealth
Bet you ain't even know that you saved yourself

[Chorus: Crystal Torres]
The waves can be your cover, the beach can be your pillow
My heart can be your house, my eyes can be your windows
To teach you how to swim and then we'll play Nintendo
Be with all of your friends, dancing to the tempo
Go Alan, go Alan
Go Alan, go Alan
Go Alan, go Alan, go Alan, go Alan
Go Alan, go Alan, go Alan, go Alan, yeah

[Outro: Crystal Torres & Lupe Fiasco]
The waves can be your cover, the beach can be your pillow
My heart can be your house, my eyes can be your windows
To teach you how to swim and then we'll play Nintendo
Be with all of your friends, dancing to the tempo
(Are you scared?)
Go Alan, go Alan
Go Alan, go Alan
Go Alan, go Alan, go Alan, go Alan
Go Alan, go Alan, go Alan, go Alan, yeah

[Interlude: Brother Nate]
Helter skelter is the order of the day
Watch what you say and what's being said
When you bow your head make sure your words are true
Make sure your god is in you
Make sure your god is in the things you say and do

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
And they say

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Opium to the ceiling
All for the love of plugs, squealing "ugh", healing
No more Timberland turf, you're too soft for this
Award-winning awkwardness you walking off into the office with
In the rims with friends' ends like state trials and Paypals
In nondescript homes in Arizona
In sub-divided neighborhoods, with floors made of solid wood
In roofs of clay tiles sits a couple million dollars
Said I tried but the old me blew it
Exactly how you knew I'd do it
All my brothers, I would love to paint 'em Jewish
Reinfiltrate the movement and assassinate the music
Exaggerate the ass and face then masturbate to it
The constituency brilliant, but the candidates are stupid
I'm too rude to ask for nudes
But way too ruthless not to pursue it

[Chorus: Nikki Jean]
Maybe, maybe you'll feel me when I
(Maybe you can feel me when I)
Feel me when I say (feel me when I say)
Whatever don't kill me (if it don't kill me, don't kill me)
Gets me through the day

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Chorus to the horses made her body porous
Absorbing up the pork made 'em enormous
Fear of rape made 'em informant
Fully 'shroomed in the motel room waging the torment
Never trust a dope fiend with your hopes and dreams
Let 'em play in museums with the dead bodies and broken things
What happens when the sugar barons meet the coca kings
And they beam it into space
Seem to be in place at the parent teacher conference
With hallucinations screaming in her face
The cleaning lady crazy, she say she got a demon in the safe
But it's eating through the back and soon be leaving through the gates
The hollerer shouts, "Who's bright enough to pay a toddler
To watch a ghoulish Oxycontin gobbler on Hanukkah?"
Maybe a Phoenix-based multi-million dollar launderer
Who fucked the cartels so bad, she attends court on the monitor

[Chorus: Nikki Jean]
Maybe, maybe you'll feel me when I
(Maybe you can feel me when I)
Feel me when I say (feel me when I say)
Whatever don't kill me (if it don't kill me, don't kill me)
Gets me through the day

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Bad trippin' through the tenderloin
Slimmer than a slot to enter coins to let a nigga join
A figure skater like Michelle Kwan
Aluminum illuminated to a hail bomb, ice
Then hold onto it like the L. Ron device
Then pass the audition
To the poor hands sided in maelstrom's position
Street sales in comparison pale to the Scottsdale bail bonds commission
It's like trappin' out the pawn shop
Gettin' close to the magic like the wrappin' on the wand box
Third layer from the wave
And grant absurd last prayers and first favors from the grave
To crack the pipes like icy nights and turn mayors into slaves
Politics bring fevers to punish dealers
Adjudicate the Jostens and stop the ring leaders
The Geese Howards and King Ghidorahs
Cook E in the family tree for steam fevers

[Chorus: Nikki Jean]
Maybe, maybe you'll feel me when I
(Maybe you can feel me when I)
Feel me when I say (feel me when I say)
Whatever don't kill me (if it don't kill me, don't kill me)
Gets me through the day

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Compose yourself, like a self-aware opera
Conjurer, in the zone like Sonic to
Produce me a sign of the end-times
In time to make profit off the T-shirts
And monetize all the research
And leave Earth feet-first
Breech, behold
Whites get whiter in the cold
And colors don't fade in the bleach, hah
Applause then fall through a man-made south
Talking to a doll at the pancake house
Then bring the lightsaber-ers
So bring the lampshades out, mood
To say something lewd on the news
And move like views on a cruise
And fuse like Q’s into U's
Ah, ooh, ah, ooh

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco & Nikki Jean]
Which side are you on?
Am I getting warmer? Cause I can't hold on
Are you close to me? Sunset so long
And can you call me? Cause I lost my phone
Should I wait for you? Or should I go home?
I can’t function, these drugs are too strong
I'm seeing stars now, but I'm still unknown
Out here alone, sunset so long, so long

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Mates for life, chillin' like space with ice
High as a cape
Snakes hiss, like air at the Sinclair
When you put it in they face like skin care
But they just egg 'em on like a hen chair
I've done that, I've been there
This a comeback, let me unpack
And unwrap souvenirs
Free as a speech on the untapped
Flat like time on the run
Why you bring a holster to a gun rack?
That's the alpha and omega, that’s the vodka and the vomit
Why you playin’ soccer with the Sonics?
That's a iPod to the Amish
You should get involved with the honest
Where everything’s honored like Elijah Muhammad
Mixed with the pontiff, hooked on phonics
Let's be liars, that's not chronic
Condone Islamic, and it's haunted, ay

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco & Nikki Jean]
Which side are you on?
Am I getting warmer? And I can’t hold on
Are you close to me? Sunset so long
And can you call me? Cause I lost my phone
Should I wait for you? Or should I go home?
I can't function, these drugs are too strong
Stro-, stro-, stro-, stro-, stro-, stro-, stro-, stro-
Stro-, stro-, stro-, stro-, stro-, stro-, stro-, stro-
Stro-, stro-, stro-, stro-, stro-, stro-
(I've always loved you)

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Sun god Sam and the California drug deals
Rain drop Wayne and the Bangkok love bills
Hoin', she knows that I'm crooked like Owen
But still goin' like a paradox, parasite, know it ain't right
Whether it's fair or not she knows that I'm horny like Triceratops
Together, but separated like a pair of socks
Wow, like Pac using both hands
And his head is the O
I only follow escorts now, call it sticking to the program
Fucking all the police addicted to the pole dance
C'm'here like Pol Pot
You love it over here like gold watch
I would treat the box like it's UPS, I would treat the box like a sneakerhead
If you shake and throw it like a match with a cigarette
Then drop it like a match on a gas trail
Fix another round for the mob, you the bomb
Like Jihad, up and down 'til the guards of the back fell
Still wanna, put my meat up in your V like I'm Maxwell
Stick a fork in it, dog, it's important to y'all
But it's pork in it so it ain't important at all
Saw an underground lair with a torch in the hall
When unfortunate calls from the horoscope cards
And the fortunes and balls
Outfit so small, saw a portion of drawers
Carrera slide off the track and put the Porsche in the wall
Like skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco & Nikki Jean]
Which side are you on?
Am I getting warmer? Cause I can't hold on
Are you close to me? Sunset so long
And can you call me? Cause I lost my phone
Should I wait for you? Or should I go home?
I can't function, these drugs are too strong
I'm seeing stars now, but I'm still unknown
Out here alone, sunset so long, so long

[Intro: Troi Irons]
You and me, I'm curious to see
Could we be everything you need?
You don't have to go, go, go
We can be alone, alone, together in this

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, uh, yeah
She just walks, and talks to the noise in her heads
Safe in the middle but destroys at the edge
Burns up the nest and poisons the eggs
When the sound hits the ground, the tone seems to beg
For the dark, wanna dart but it's too hard to march
When your heart's nailed down to the "start, on your mark"
Then a spark but she parked, too caught up in the blitz
To risk ripping them apart
So she wanna stay, on a high tonight to survive
The eyes pry wide down the manor
Opening the face to be go washed and awash in the glow
Of the faraway souls of downtown Atlanta
My report, a million similar souls signaling
Hoping to be a synonym for now
Put in a pill again when it drowns, when the night comes 'round
And the sky opens up and the lights come, down

[Pre-Chrorus: Troi Irons]
Fluorescent, iridescent
Are you gonna take it all away?
Fluorescent, luminescent
Are you gonna take it all away?

[Chorus: Troi Irons]
You and me, ecstasy (X-XO)
You and me, ecstasy (XO)
'Round and 'round, we can't slow down
Come too far, we can't stop now (X-X-XO)
You and me, ecstasy (X-XO)
You and me, ecstasy (XO)
'Round and 'round, we can't slow down
Gone too far, we can't stop now (X-X-XO)

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Uhh, she just runs, and comes to the back of the beginning
Which once was the happiness of winning
The killing contrived the inner vibe, tried to fill her in size
But didn't survive the attack of other feelings
Cracking at the seals, life-hacking it, backing it
Something real as the key to the ease of the bees in the ceilings
Fauceting all the things down from the dark clouds
The valve house, canals, the foul, the undependents 'til it breaks
The surge, tsunamis down advantages
Knocking down establishments, washing out the catalyst of fate
Weight filling the room, moon, the moon
And the wanderlust stuck in downtown Los Angeles
(A report!) A billion similar souls signaling
Hoping to be a synonym for now
Put in a pill again when it drowns when the night comes 'round
And the sky opens up and the lights come, down

[Pre-Chorus: Troi Irons]
Fluorescent, iridescent
Are you gonna take it all away
Fluorescent, luminescent
Are you gonna take it all away

[Chorus: Troi Irons]
You and me, ecstasy (X-XO)
You and me, ecstasy (XO)
'Round and 'round, we can't slow down
Gone too far, we can't stop now (X-X-XO)

[Bridge: Troi Irons]
They're right where I stay
Surround us
In the revend night babe
They found us
Fluorescent, iridescent
Are you gonna take it all away?
Fluorescent, luminescent
Are you gonna take it all away?

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Uhh, they combed Earth to seek out a soul to research
Identify the atoms united to make it work
Then wreck it, re-order, re-organize and perfect it
Then let it, forget it, then stepping into the method
Let it shed its aesthetics into ascetic
State of ethics vetted to better his new genetics
Medics, headed where warfare's kinetic
The square's self aware and dares to self edit
And pregnant, batters, data no longer matters
Platters shatters scatters the fragments all on fanatics
Damage, managed to still be able to feel
Some of the long lost magic of downtown Damascus
Infinity, similar souls signaling
Hoping to be a synonym for now
Put in a pill again when it drowns when the night comes 'round
And the sky opens up and the lights come, down

[Chorus: Troi Irons]
You and me, ecstasy (X-XO)
You and me, ecstasy (XO)
'Round and 'round, we can't slow down
Gone too far, we can't stop now (X-X-XO)
You and me, ecstasy (X-XO)
You and me, ecstasy (XO)
'Round and 'round, we can't slow down
Gone too far, we can't stop now (X-X-XO)

[Interlude: Dr. Nolan Shaw]
Adults are responsible for teaching children how to observe the ways of their ancestors. In fact, God insists that adults talk to their children when they sit at home and when they walk along the road. When they lie down, and when they get up. In other words, God is saying, "Don't mess up the children". African American families are being driven further and further apart from each other, to the extent their children, particularly those living in urban neighborhoods, are growing up without the benefit of having adults in whom they can confide. Consequently, African-American cultural values are at risk of being lost, like teaching children to respect their elders and saying "thank you" or "no thank you" and other forms of common courtesy. God is saying, "Don't mess up the children"

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco & Damian Marley]
Facts from the 'Raq
Yout!

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco & Damian Marley]
Port-au-Prince is a kingdom, Kingston is a kingdom
New Orleans is a kingdom, South Central is a kingdom, yah
Freedom, free men without freedom
Black life is a kingdom, why kill yourself for no reason, for?
(Facts from the ’Raq)

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Hold the sword like a hand should
Rights of passage into manhood
Heightened malice in the land, look
Like the lights of havoc do no damn good
Half sleep from being overpreached
The other half sleep cause the Xan good
A chief would take his hand like a thief
And make him stand like a man would
In the face of an ambush
To the back of they attack
Front of they frontline, out the plane
With no parachutes in they backpacks
Choppin' weed then droppin' seeds
Then flowers grow where they land at
Proper deeds on top of these
To make power flow from they handclaps
Suicide, it’s a suicide
You and I, we're the new divide
Who arrived to see you survive, that means
Two would die to make you alive, it means
You should ride for the two that died, that means
You will ride with the youth inside your king
You are lying with the truth beside the things
Wise to the lies that the youth provide and bring war

[Pre-Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]
Does a king make a kingdom, or the kingdom make a king?
Is it free when it's freedom, or being dumb mean you free?
Does a king make a kingdom, or the kingdom make a king?
Is it free when it's freedom, or being dumb mean you free?

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco & Damian Marley]
Port-au-Prince is a kingdom, Kingston is a kingdom
New Orleans is a kingdom, South Central is a kingdom, yah
Freedom, free men without freedom
Black life is a kingdom, why kill yourself for no reason, for?

Why kill yourself for no reason, for?

[Verse 2: Damian Marley]
Well if man was meant to fly, Jah woulda made us all with wings
Well he made us all with crowns, that mean seh every man a king
Your mind it is your castle, mind cyan govern how you think
The ghetto is a kingdom, care not how the gully stink
No one can change my mind, no I am thoroughly convinced
My woman is a queen that bring forth more princess and prince
And if you add up the equation, it must mean I'm royal since
Everyone in my surroundings is of royal heritage
Not everyone of royal blood dress up in a mink
Whole heap of king and queen with dem roof make out of zinc
So Jah bless the baby mother washing nappy in a sink
And ah raise the generation weh ah take it to the brink

[Pre-Chorus: Damian Marley]
Does the king make a kingdom, or does a kingdom make a king?
This hidden empire have kings and queens that no one's noticing
Does a king make a kingdom, or does a kingdom make a king?
This hidden empire have kings and queens that no one’s noticing

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco & Damian Marley]
Port-au-Prince is a kingdom, Kingston is a kingdom
New Orleans is a kingdom, South Central is a kingdom, yah
Freedom, free men without freedom
Black life is a kingdom, why kill yourself for no reason, for?

Why kill yourself for no reason, for?

[Outro: Lupe Fiasco & Damian Marley]
Only fools would feel proud of a dead man
My mind is an excellent weapon
I will not die for a label, let’s come to the table
And put together all our blessings
Our blessings religious, our blessings ability
Our blessings materially, identify enemy
Disconnect from the mentally
Put all of our energy into the kingdom
Back to the front on my way now
God has to show you your way 'round
Tired, I watch while you lay down
You go while I sleep, I put heart to the beat
Take a part of my piece and inherit the heritage
We're not American dreamin'
We’re realizing a kingdom
Only fools would feel proud of a dead man
My mind is an excellent weapon
I will not die for a label, let's come to the table
And put together all our blessings
Our blessings religious, our blessings ability
Our blessings materially, identify enemy
Disconnect from the mentally
Put all of our energy into the kingdom
Back to the front on my way now
God has to show you your way 'round
Tired, I watch while you lay down
You go while I sleep, I put heart to the beat
Take a part of my piece and inherit the heritage
We're not American dreamin'
We're realizing a kingdom

[Verse 1]
Oh yeah
Candles burning low
Lots of mistletoe
Lots of snow and ice
Everywhere we go
Choirs singing carols
Right outside my door

[Chorus]
All these things and more
(all these things and more)
That's what Christmas means to me my love
(that's what Christmas means to me my love)

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah

And ya know what I mean
I see your smiling face
Like I never seen before
Even though I love ya madly
It seems I love you more
The little cards you give me
Will touch my heart for sure

[Chorus]
All these things and more, darling
(all these things and more, darling)
Whoa
That's what Christmas means to me my love
(that's what Christmas means to me my love)

[Verse 3]
Oh yeah ha ha
I feel like running wild
(Running wild)
As anxious as a little child
Greet you neath the mistletoe
Kiss you once and then some more
And wish you a Merry Christmas baby
(wish you a Merry Christmas baby)
And such happiness in the coming year
(Happiness in the coming year)
Oh baby
Let's deck the halls with holly
Sing sweet silent night
Fill the tree with angel hair
And pretty, pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight

[Chorus]
All these things and more, baby
(all these things and more, baby)
Whoa
That's what Christmas means to me my love
(that's what Christmas means to me my love)
Oh baby baby

[Outro]
Yeah
Candles burning low
Lots and lots of snow
Alright
Christmas bells are ringing
Christmas choirs singing
Coo
Christmas mistletoe

[Intro: Matt Champion]
"—perfectly fine, that's fine!"

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Said nigga, brother, nigga, brother, what you living for?
Is you gon' finish what you started? What you quitting for?
They told me God gave me a mission, but I'm missing the supplies to complete it
I ain't the one you should read in, I'm used to being defeated
So nigga, brother, who you standing with?
I'm independent 'cause these parties never planned for this
Brother nigga with a brain, unintentionally swerving in every lane
The feeling's never the same, you chase what you couldn't gain
I'm so accustomed to flames, I couldn't tell you what's fire
Situation is dire, hear them calls from the choir
The disposition acquired from my position on Earth
Is telling me, "Decapitate everything for what it's worth!"
When I die, these words gon' need separate caskets and a hearse
I don't rhyme; I freeze time and let these hands just do the work
I'm in tandem with my curse, going manic since my birth
See the canvas as I planned it, I'm commanding with my nerves, ah

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumping
Tell my boy I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll
Build a different house with some different functions
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumping
Tell my boy I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll
Build a different house with some different functions

[Bridge: bearface]
Try to treat man like baby
Feel the teeth sink in like rabies
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Boy, you know you don't look fly
Them gold chains turn your neck green, bye
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Nothin' different now (Woo!) all around now (Woo!)
Who you keep around now? That's a big reflection
Don't like how they talkin' to me—why they walkin' to me?
Wear your shit upon your sleeve, soul projectin' on me
Sense is your surround sound, what's your take on me?
Kill the ego now, what that make of me?
Angle widescreen, couple sips of Tanqueray
I'ma throw a couple punches, I'ma do it anyway
Chin up, little son, I'm slidin' like the macarena
Lose time, pen it, style spiced on, jalapeño
Supersonic, move through tunnel, two-wheel cycle, Spike Lee
Silence crowd better than 9 millimeter with extended suppressor
Bustin' out the function, highly comfortable
Got this Martine on my body, man, my sweat lethal
Sweet kisses like the candy out the carnival
I'ma call my own shots, hit the audible

[Verse 3: Joba]
Impending death is the only sign of life
I'm throwing Hail Marys 'til I die
Throw it up, all I have is peace of mind, throwin' up
Have my wings clipped, I don't need them shits
Learn to fly again
Fast track to last place, I swear
I've never been up top but I'm up here somewhere
Out here, nobody can tell me shit
Shit, never mind what I did back then
You should take a look at yourself instead
Maybe you can find yourself, love yourself
Here's to health and here's to wealth, all together now

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Jaden]
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumping
Tell my boy, I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll
Build a different house with some different functions
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumping
Tell my boy, I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll
Build a different house with some different functions

[Verse 4: Merlyn Wood]
Hoo! Voodoo Man
Momma took me to the church, and I sang a hymn
Co— Colonized Chris-ti-an
Now I'm losing my reli-gi-on
God damn, so narcissistic this millennium
Fuck you and the bubble that you livin' in
I don't go to church, but I'm so spiritual
Pulled my life out of dirt, that's a miracle
If Jesus was a pop star, would he break the bank?
All these diamonds in my face, I'm shining like the day
I'm living in my prime, man, what can I say?
If the service is a hour, I'm a hour late

[Intro]
Take it all, or leave it

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I can't sleep like I used to
The world will try to tell you who you are before you get to
Explain yourself, your thoughts
Your motives and all of your reasons
Two albums every season, what the hell do y’all believe in?
Why the hell do y'all keep reachin'?
In the evenings when I see ’em
I tell myself that love will be the thing to keep us from grieving
Need something new to believe in
'Cause these new niggas'll change on you
I mean they change on you
Why the hell the BBC only writes about me
When it comes down to controversy?
What about three CD's in one year with no label?
Then we signed and our story turned into a fucking fable
I was that nigga in a room
With no motherfuckin' cable and no table
Now my mom call me whenever she need her car note
Cellphone, whatever bill paid too, y'all niggas losers
You don't understand why I do what I do, so let me do it
Get the hell on, let me do it, get the hell on, let me do it

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I don't speak like I used to
I’m thinking of a way to change the world that I move through
I feel like Nikola, what I invent is what I’m true to
I feel for Nikola with these ideas that I grew through
I know that when they see a brilliant mind they'll just abuse you
It’s hard to feel what's real, some nights I'm scared that I'm delusional
I’m scared I'm more like Nikola than I'd ever collude to
I'm scared of what can happen when ideas will consume you
'Cause there isn't room for peace I can achieve

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout

[Bridge: Merlyn Wood]
Stay rough, get buff, get out, hey, boy
Stay rough, get buff, get out
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys
Hey, boy, stay rough, get buff, get out
Hey, boy, stay rough, get buff, get out
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys

[Verse 3: Joba]
Don't mind me, I'm just killin' time (You can pick me to pieces)
But if you've got a lifeline, throw it, throw it
Don't mind me, I'm just killin' time (You can pick me to pieces)
But if you've got a lifeline, throw it, throw it

[Verse 4: bearface]
Why the fuck would you share this shit with these people?
I don't know these people, I don't know you either, no more
I'm at war with myself
Every time I see this shit I wanna kill myself
And they coming for my mother, sending bullets for my head
Think they fallin' in love but I'd rather be dead
Please just leave me alone, I don't wanna be read
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout

[Outro: Merlyn Wood, Matt Champion, Ashlan Grey, Jabari Manwa, Joba & Romil Hemnani]
It's the best years of our lives, motherfucker
You are now about to experience
These are the best years of our lives
I feel you

[Intro: London Community Gospel Choir, bearface]
I gotta get that bag
It's a thug life, it's a thug life
I gotta get that bag (Run, sha-na-na-na-na-sha-ah)
It's a thug life (La-da-da-da)
It's a thug life (It's a, oh-uh-oh)
Ooh-ah (Sha-na-na-na-na-na-sha-ah)
La-da-da-da (It's a— ooh-uh-oh)

[Verse 1: bearface]
Try to treat man like baby
Feel the teeth sink in like rabies
Boy, you know you don't look fly
Them gold chains turn your neck green, right?
Ah ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Ah ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Ah ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Ah ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah ah

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
It's different reconciling with skeletons I ain't know I possessed
I sought perfection out in ways I no longer accept
I understand what I neglect in times when I obsess
I'm learning to confess, this fate is harder to digest
The biggest threat I'm up against is who I face in my reflection
Depression still an uninvited guest I'm always accepting
Can't help but meet the feeling with a familiar embrace
When I know that it'll kill me if I give into my brain
I see the shadows inside—they ten feet tall with no eyes
They put my head in the water, and it's so beautiful under
The sun reflecting off the corals, colors I can't describe
To make the darkness divine

[Outro: bearface]
Sha-na-na-na-na-sha-ah
(La-da-da-da) It's a, oh-uh-oh
Ooh-ah
Sha-na-na-na-na-sha-ah
(La-da-da-da) It's a, oh-uh-oh
Ooh-ah
Sha-na-na-na-na-sha-ah

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Big old whiskey on them icy rocks
Flood down some veins like oxy does
I need fresh air, I need oxygen
Who the hell you fooling? It's so obvious
I don't feel it, I don't see it, this is blasphemy
I can't help but feel like you is after me
Is you drinking for the pain? Is you drinking for fun?
There's a party outside, 'til the morning gon' come
Is you dancing all alone? Is you dancing for someone?
There's a party outside, know the night is young
Is you having fun?

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Say it with your chest, say it with your chest
Pray it work again
Putting diamonds on my back, putting diamonds on my back, yeah
Say it with your chest, say it with your chest
Pray it work again
Putting diamonds on my back, putting diamonds on my back, yeah

[Chorus: bearface]
But you know if I waste my time
Talking 'bout what ain't mine
And you know I'll be last in line
Just like last, last night

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I said, I said "Who that? Who that? Who that? Who that?"
Lurking in the shadows
Tryna catch me liberating spirits from the gallows
They wanna blackball me, but I held my avocados
Then they melt down like the hash we mix in our tobacco
Circle tighter than the Castro, they feeding you Castrol
You'd think that it's gas, you turn the key, it's a fiasco
Could be stronger than Vibranium, don't mean that I ain't fragile
Grapple with reality to break out of these shackles

[Chorus: bearface]
But you know if I waste my time
Talking 'bout what ain't mine
And you know I'll be last in line
Just like last, last night

[Verse 3: Joba]
Suicidal thoughts, but I won't do it
Take that how you want, it's important I admit it
I'm afraid of commitment, don't know how to fix it
Maybe codependent, can't tell the difference
When the push comes to shove, I'd rather bend than break
But something's gotta give, ain't that what they say
When you're torn between reality, and a choice you could have made
Or should've made, they're not the same, I'm not the same
Maybe I'm broken, either way I'm clinging on closely
I know it's unhealthy, appreciate your patience
I know that I'm selfish, do my best to be selfless
I know that I'm changing, I know that I'm changing

[Outro: London Community Gospel Choir]
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more

[Chorus: bearface]
She said, "Baby boy, why you looking grimy as shit?"
I'll make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
Now look, look

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Trade in that noose they put around us for a Cuban link
So my ancestors can see me shining, tell me what you think
I remember the illusions that they tried to move to me
That pollution still ain't stunt my evolution
What you choosing?

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
No chip on my shoulder, hunnid leagues under the sea (Hoo!)
We live life like cheetah power up like Hummer diesel
Golden chain for niece and nephew
Pessimistic, I do not hang 'round them boys
Metaphysics, need another dimension I can enjoy

[Chorus: bearface]
She said, "Baby boy, why you looking grimy as shit?"
I'll make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
Now look, look
Baby boy, why you looking grimy as shit?
I'll make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
Now look, look

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Reporting for the operation
I learned that the beauty is in the creation
I added my detail for decoration
So, baby boy, what's the occasion?
You dressed like you 'bout to take over a nation
Avoiding social litigation
When that admiration turns into abrasion
Y'all can find another station
Otherwise, stay tuned, evolution coming soon
Rolling deeper than a dune
Howling at the moon, I'll be back in June
Told my baby I'd be back in November
Did some Beatles shit to kick off this September
Crazy, 'cause in 2010, I had some old friends
That thought I'd be another—

[censored]
Go fucking figure

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
If I pull up out the tool
Riding still up on the roof
Seems like only legends do
(Check this, hot lookin' babes!)
Bitch, and that's the fucking move
(I feel you, when she said—)

[Chorus: bearface]
She said, "Baby boy, why you lookin' grimy as shit?"
I make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
Now look, look
Baby boy, why you lookin' grimy as shit?
I make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
Now look, look

[Verse 4: Joba]
Good riddance, goodbye
Out of sight, out of mind
Cutthroat every time
This time, I get what's mine
Where the hell is your backbone?
Ducking me like Whac-A-Mole
Looking like an inflatable at a car show
A spectacle
Lick my finger, bet I found the wind
I follow that shit wherever it blows
You hung yourself, that's not my fault
I just supplied the rope, ugh!
Most thoughts, I don't think twice
Make decisions I'll die by
Never asked for the drama
But I'll turn it into dollars
Dollars, dollars, dollars

[Outro]
"Do you think about me?"
Ohh, ohh

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Something about him
His car ain't nice and flashy (Yeah, yeah)
There’s something about him
Yeah, his attitude is like magic (Yeah, yeah)
There's something about him
I know I got to have it
And oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Refrain: Kevin Abstract]
I really like how you do all the things that you do
I really like how you say all the things that you say (I love him!)
I really like how you do all the things you could do
I really like all the things that you really could say, ayy
I really like how you move when you're out by yourself
I really like all your crew and you can take ’em to hell
Boy, don't you know I fucking got you? Right, right

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
There's something about him
His car ain't nice and flashy (Yeah, yeah)
There's something about him
Yeah, his attitude is like magic (Yeah, yeah)
There's something about him
I know I got to have it
And oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
I love him, I love him
Something about him

There's not a soul in here

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
Pull to your house and dump like the trash man
All up in your grill, but I'm not a fan
Merlyn, I do no hat trick, just show me where the cash at
Then show me where the hash at, fuck that
Show me where the cash at
(There's not a soul in here)
I would rather be on acid, rather make investments
They'll come out of that debt, we'll come out of those bedsheets
I'm like the IRS, pull up to your address
I was trying my best to seizure, but pull it like Keisha
(There's not a soul in here)
Johnny Dang gon' ice my diamonds, up out that freezer
I used to be broke, I don't got amnesia
I used to deal with both, now it's black victims
She know not to call collect if she go to prison
(There's not a soul in here)

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat (Ba-dam!)
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at (Show out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that (Ayy, clip, ho out, throw down, ho out, know 'bout, throw down, hold out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that
(There's not a soul in here—)
Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat (Ba-dam!)
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at (Show out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that
(Ayy, clip, ho out, throw down, ho out)
(Now 'bout, throw down, hold out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
At night, I bring them out, I was sleeping upside-down
Keep you up, I come around, they stay right up on my tail
Send me a pic whenever it slip, hoping this outflow my scales
Full throttle whenever I blaze, fifty mil', put it all in my will
(There's not a soul in here—)
Human, I see through your eyes, until my CCC wide open to my skin
They can see they run, they feel like they been kicking DDR
Bustin' out the bar, human of the tour
They grip three types of the gas, miss the days I can't get back
(There's not a soul in here—)

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat (Ba-dam!)
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at? (Show out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that (Ayy, clip, ho out, throw down, ho out, know 'bout, throw down, hold out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that
(There's not a soul in here—)
Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat (Ba-dam!)
G-P to S and figure, where you niggas at (Show out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that (Ayy, clip, ho out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that

[Intro]
"I'm Sammy Jo, and my favorite colors are, um, black and red."

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Let me find my way out of this bitch (Uh)
Find myself high in the distance (Uh)
Find me up, lying in this ditch (Ugh)
With a wrist and some diamonds a-mixin' (Woo)
If I can't find the time to get my heart out (Ugh)
Would you stomp 'em out when we slow the world down? (Ugh)
Would you hold it down for me when my heart pound? (Ugh)
Ain't no telling, no telling, so call the coroner
Let me find my way out of this bitch (Ugh)
Find myself high in the distance (Ugh)
Find me up, lying in this ditch (Ugh)
With a wrist and some diamonds a-mixin' (Woo)
If I can't find the time to get my heart out (Ugh)
Would you stomp 'em out when we slow the world down? (Ugh)
Would you hold it down for me when my heart pound? (Ugh)
Ain't no telling, no telling, so call the coroner

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
Ayy, I'ma just bounce with that
In fact, I bought a whole damn house with that
Ayy, hand me where the ounces at
Tell me where the damn these ounces at
Ayy, tell me where the ounces at
Tell me where the ounces, ounces at
Ayy, tell me where the ounces at
Tell me where the ounces, ounces at

[Verse 2: Joba]
It's getting hot, you best just—
Woo! Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down, simmer down
The effects can't touch this
Woo! Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down, simmer down
Stand up, stand down, bitch
Woo! Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down, simmer down
Wait, wait, wait

[Verse 3: bearface]
I'm alive, I'm alive, the bags in my ride, I, I
I ain't ever been the one that's scared of you
Baby, you can come and get it
I'm alive, I'm alive, the bags in my ride, I, I
Baby, when the karma gets you, yeah
Maybe you can run away with us

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
In my bag, in the vault
Moving on, move along, ain't my fault
Moved too fast, life had skidded to a halt
Got back on the road and made it to the start
Disregarding the emotional discharge
Can't forget the mission put into my heart
I ain't playing games with you to play your part
Standing up with pride behind my battle scars

[Verse 5: Matt Champion]
Money walk and money talk, but money no make comfortable
Big-ass house and big-ass car don't add up when you die alone
I want wife, nice life, highlights with some little clones
I want bliss, no strife
Rewind, don't slice around my aura with the better lies
I want a better life, bend around the corner
One deep, eyes shut, really know the place
Projecting on me, I don't correlate
Straight from manipulation, wouldn't wanna infiltrate my brothers
Still wanna get me high, eyes low off that methadone
Always throwing curve, like a reaper scythe
Gnawing on my wood like a termite
Entering my world like a parasite
(Parasite, parasite, parasite, parasite, parasite, parasite)

[Verse 6: Joba, Kevin Abstract]
Praise God, hallelujah! (God, God)
I'm still depressed (Damn, damn)
At war with my conscience
Paranoid, can't find that shit
Woo, praise God, hallelujah! (God, God)
I'm still depressed (Damn, damn)
At war with my conscience
Paranoid, I can't—

[Breakdown: Kevin Abstract]
Let me find my way out of this bitch
"I'm Sammy Jo, and my favorite colors are, um, black and red." (Damn)
(Ugh) With a wrist and some diamonds a-mixin'
(Ooh da-aa, da, da, da, da)
If I can't find the time to get my heart out (Ugh)
Would you stomp 'em out when we slow the world down? (Damn)
Would you hold it down for me when my heart pound? (Ugh)
Ain't no telling, no telling, so call the coroner

[Outro: bearface, Kevin Abstract]
Sittin' on your porch, across parking lots and you
Light it up, better dodge the cops
And I'll never get sick of playing with your locks
I, I miss you lots, I, I miss you lots, I, I
Sittin' on your porch, across parking lots
That's all I got for you
And I'll never get sick of playing with your locks, I, I
That's all I got for you
Sittin' on your porch, across parking lots and you
That's all I got for you
Miss you lots, I, I miss you lots, I, I
That's all I got for you
Sittin' on your porch, across parking lots
That's all I got for you
And I'll never get sick of playing with your locks
I, I miss you lots, I, I miss you lots
I, I miss you lots, I, I miss you lots, I, I
That's all I got for you

[Intro]
Take it all, or leave it
I feel you

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
When there's a rough patch, don't eye for the parachute
They goin' AWOL the second that the light goes on
This a treat, ain't it, soon as she hit the powder room
I pull it back and check my roots, and yeah, I'm 'bout to bloom
It's that '90 raised from hell shit, parlay like when the lane switch
Combat how you feel, strobe light, I hit the killswitch
Neck twist like Exorcist, I'ma see you 'round
'Cause tonight's the night I'm losin' all I'm doin', I'm about this

[Chorus: Joba]
White cuffs, wood grain
Money in the suitcase on my way to the bank
White cuffs, wood grain
Money in the suitcase on my way to the bank
On my way to the bank, on my way to the bank
On my way to the bank, suitcase
On my way to the bank, on my way to the bank
On my way to the bank

[Verse 2: Joba]
'Til the casket drops, I will play God
Fuck the world, let's start a riot
Got too much, too quick
God damn, I'm feelin' sick, bitch, call the doctor
Don't act like I ain't been dead to ya
Don't act like I ain't deserve this shit
Couldn't last a day inside my head
That's why I did the drugs I did
Got issues with these motherfuckers
Looking down from they pedestals
From that petty view, on that petty shit
Pray for peace with a knife in my hand
Speak my piece like a gun to my head
Come equipped just to blast this shit
Misunderstood since birth
Fuck what you think, and fuck what you heard
I feel betrayed, you can keep the praise
And all of the fuck shit need to get away
Still ain't got the fright to the fickle-minded people
I thought I knew better, wish I knew better
Should have known better, wish that I was better
At dealing with the fame and you fake motherfuckers
Guess I'm too real

[Break: Lavaman]
Excuse we?
Let we pass, rum is the gas
We ain't play nice, little guy
Doh blame meh, blame di rum, no t—

[Bridge 1: Merlyn Wood, Lavaman]
I be in my bag (Excuse we?)
Goin' in (Let we pass, rum is the gas)
Guess who isn't built for this, man?
Me and my thugs built for this, man (Yeah)
We goin' for the gifts and the grams (Doh—)
I be in my bag (Excuse we?)
Goin' in (Let we pass, rum is the gas)
Smokin' all the grams in this bag
Man, you isn't built for this, man (Yeah)
Run it like the gingerbread man (Doh—)

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Fuck that shit, stay hydrated, nigga
I'ma lick that bitch, go home, kiss my momma, wassup?
Wassup?
Black power fist hangin' from my black 'fro
Yo, she saw me in that cereal, she want to lick a Oreo, damn
Break the dam when I spit the flow
I'm on the lamb like the fuckin' wool
Hoppin' out the van, I'm at Abbey Road
Fans with cameras in the bathroom, man, that's difficult
I just wanna smoke a Backwoods by my lonely self
Chill, watch numbers go up, book off the shelf
I found myself and put my face on a missing shirt
I dropped out with no promise that this shit would
(That this shit would work, work, work
Work, work, work, work)
(Work, work, work, work, work, work, work, work)

[Bridge 2: bearface]
With the dogs in my ride, know the doors suicide
Paranoid, do or die, you should know we never lie
With the dogs in my ride, know the doors suicide
Paranoid, do or die, you should know we never lie
Pull up with the racks to your shop
Cop a medallion or three, I'm the don
Zim, zim, zim out the Bim', get shot
One mill, two mill, three, that's a lot, damn

[Chorus: Joba]
White cuffs, wood grain
Money in the suitcase on my way to the bank
White cuffs, wood grain
Money in the suitcase on my way to the bank
On my way to the bank, on my way to the bank
On my way to the bank, bank, bank, suitcase
On my way to the bank, on my way to the bank
On my way to the bank, bank, bank

[Intro: Matt Champion]
"Yo, get—

[censored]—turn that shit over, boy!"

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
¿Cómo se dice? Don't touch on me with them dedos
I minimize all your credentials, I maximize all of my pesos
I want that dance that can do it, give it to me straight, don't dilute it
I'm one-handed like Odell, numb the pain like Orajel
Up and down like gopher bear, hand on me like "Oh, well"
What that smell like, oh, Chanel? Way too deep like depths of Hell
Need a smoke and shot of whisky, down this bitch like, "Oh, they prissy"
Talking smack, oh, don't get lippy, love on you, oh, don't forget me

[Chorus: Matt Champion]
Coming like—ee, ee, ee, ee, woah, woah, woah
Take 'em back—ee, ee, ee, ee, woah, woah, woah
Talkin' up—ee, ee, ee, ee, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Radiation is present, got my reflection iridescent
Every little moment I step in might shift the planets direction
Glitch in the system is present, you might wanna check the connection
I don't give a fuck about freshmans, I don't give a fuck about veterans
If your perception ain't ascending, it's no reason for extension
Of my energy, this shit only happens once in a century
It's elementary when all you speak is rudimentary
Paradiddles hidden in riddles; vapid and accessories—
So please, don't get it mistaken, opportunities taken
Didn't want to be patient, we had to fight for this thing
Ain't no acting complacent, the disrespect been too blatant
We claimed this spot from the basement, so tell me, who you again?
Oh you was this, you was that? But now you washed, and you hate it?
You taking shots with revolvers, I got two drones at the station
Hit the button, they might come and leave your legacy vacant
You paved a path we didn't want to get demolished with aging

[Breakdown: bearface, Kevin Abstract, Dom McLennon]
Ayy, ayy, we get money, get dough
Dame más, mi princesa says so (Uh)
Even though my teeth not gold
Baby girl know our pockets drip folds
(Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!)
We get money, get dough
Dame más, mi princesa says so (Uh)
Even though my teeth not gold
Baby girl know our pockets drip folds

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Money on my—, money on my—
Niggas that I—, niggas that I—
We said what's up—, we said what's up—
Message that I—, message that I—
Call her brother—, call her brother—
Niggas lookin'—, niggas lookin'—
Let my niggas—, let my niggas—
Niggas with that—, niggas with that—

[Chorus: Matt Champion]
Ee, ee, ee, ee, woah, woah, woah
Take 'em back—ee, ee, ee, ee, woah, woah, woah
Talkin' up—ee, ee, ee, ee, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Outro: Dom McLennon]
Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!

[Interview: Cam'ron & DJ Whoo Kid]
"Amazing how back then fame was more important than the business, like—"
"Yeah, you know, that's what I was explaining to somebody. I said I didn't mind gettin' jerked because I was like, I just want my record on the radio, I just wanna shoot videos"
"...And get it popping"
"I just wanna get popping. Look, I don't care—take my publishing, I don't know what that is anyway, you know what I'm saying? Like just take my shit so I can have a video and songs on the radio, I'll figure it out later"
"That's crazy, man"
"And then the next album, I'll start and I'm like, damn, these checks ain't like the checks I'm used to niggas seeing. I'm not being able to get four or five cars or jewelry or things I wanted to get, so I'm like let me figure out what's the loophole in this shit. Why I'm not winning"
"But isn't it crazy that it makes you question what kind of friends you had back then? Because they weren't telling you how the business was running and they were just—"
"See, that goes to show, maybe they wasn't never really my friends..."

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I can barely rap, I can barely dance
I can barely laugh, I can barely hang
I need a male stripper, do a belly dance
For me and my boyfriend, that's entertainment
And I'm drunk as fuck, my nigga sucks up
I need a reason to get my bucks up
I need a reason to care about society
They need a good enough reason just to hire me
But honestly, you see, my mom can't walk
And her lungs don't work like they used to
I feel like it's my fault 'cause of music
I be saying shit that's just fucking rude and untrue, and
But truthfully, your words had damage, and it's cruel to me
But even more cruel to be dissing you
In front of niggas that pay to hear me
Sometimes I be wondering, why I been tripping off it
I should probably spend my time writing rhymes in the dentist's office
That's killing two birds in one stone
When I was younger, way before I was grown
I wanted a deal with Death Row or Rhymesayers
I'm saving my time for mics later
I might save it, depending on the shit that y'all write later
I hate writers, I hate tweets, I hate journalists
They hate truth, they hate peace; they want my niggas to burn with us

[Verse 2: Joba]
Flicking on the face of my wristwatch
Watch the time stop just to speed up, watch life unfold
And between the tick-tocks, speeding down the one-way
Fuck these signs, fuck these lights, put my life on the line
When it feel right, I'm fine, no, I'm not lying, don't ask me
I'll pay the fine, I'll pay the toll, just hope I don't crash it
But hey, if I do, it will be a blaze of glory
Engulfed by the manifestation of death behind me
All my life I've felt inadequate
And through the years I've dealt with tragedy after tragedy
God, send a message, send a messenger my way
Never claimed to be a saint, forgive me
Feel like the light that I was blessed with has diminished
I'm haunted by the visions of my youth turned true
I've come to expect my expectations aren't true
But I'm a master of believing my lies
And you can't break me, and I can't brake at the speed of light

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
I'm afraid to share the bed—what if she want money later?
Like she got laid off—ugh, hit my lawyer for some paper
I'm afraid to speak my pains—like, "You lucky where you at"
"You cool, but quit complaining 'bout all that"
That's why I'm showing up late
I'm not tryna be a dick, but my time is not to waste
For my shell, fuck the small talk with my sensei
Where my sense at? Four-cylinder go round
Lincoln Town Car pick me up, drop me off
I got bubble under my biceps, sneak me into the sidestep
Ego is getting sized up, I be on butterfly effect
Fuck it, I'll be myself now, tell 'em I'll take no shit now
Tell 'em they work for me now, tell 'em my tears, they bleed down
Tell 'em I work, like, what, what time for me now?
Wondering, "Who is me?" now, wondering where you been now
Lose you in crowds, I see now
Fourteen, I see 'em all inside of me now
Bank account move like speeds now, make it from ways to feed now
Thinking of ways to be everything but right now

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
It's crazy how things feel the best when reminiscing
'Til we check ourselves
It's crazy how people who left say they feeling left out
When we step for health
Still accustomed to nights filled with solitude
I don't always remember to call goodnight
I don't always remember my altitude
I don't always remember to stop the fight
But I might check my sight, it ain't right
Yeah I know, but my strife overwhelms, every night
Until I'm forced to close my eyes
Brain disease, parasite, eating me from inside
Emotions bleed, I can't believe
How I'm sleeping through the night

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
My arms are always open, your fears always rollin'
In the deep, and you can't control it
What you want, what you want? Emotion?
My arms are always open, your fears always rollin'
In the deep, and you can't control it
What you want, what you want? Emotion?

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I need to step out with no frustration
I need a permanent getaway vacation
They got a permanent hit list, my nigga
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
50 did it right

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
I could've been homeless
I thought I moved to orphanage for the summer
I could've been homeless
Before I had a goal, I had a course

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
My people still dry snitchin' whenever they touch the mic
That's what happens when a therapist isn't somewhere in sight
Take flight, never leaned to the left, or the right
'Cause they turn the other cheek when our niggas start to die
When our women start to die, when our children start to die
I don't feel their empathy, we been displaced too many times
Every summer in the city start to feel like Columbine
'Cause you gotta get yours, and I gotta get mine
One time for the paragons of the paradigm
When you underground, they gon' only try to undermine
Use the track as a gymnasium to get into the stadium
You couldn't match my alien, I'm glowing like uranium

[Segue: Kevin Abstract and Dom McLennon, Beyoncé]
One time for the— one time—
One time— nigga, one time— nigga
One time— nigga, one t—
Nigga (Yes) nigga, nigga (Yes)
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
50 did it right, 50 did it right (Yes)
Wish I could call every successful black rapper for advice
How the fuck do I make this shit last my whole life? (Yes)
What if they don't want to come to the concert tonight? (Yes)

[Segue reversed] (Yes)
Nigga (Yes) nigga, nigga (Yes) nigga

[Bridge: Matt Champion, Beyoncé, Kevin Abstract]
(Oh) Tuggin' on my pinky ring (Yes)
Smelling like chrysanthemum
(Honestly, I just want that) (Yes)
I just want that, I just want that, I just want that, I just want that
(Oh) Tuggin' on my pinky ring (Yes)
Smelling like chrysanthemum
(Honestly, I just want that) (Yes)
I just want that, I just want that, I just want that, I just want that
(Just give me what I need)
(Oh) Tuggin' on my pinky ring (Yes)
Smelling like chrysanthemum
(Honestly, I just want that) (Yes)
I just want that, I just want that, I just want that, I just want that
All my jewelry, and all my niggas (Yes)
All my jewelry, and all my niggas got that, yeah  (Yes, yes)

[Outro: Kevin Abstract, Beyoncé]
Ooh, ooh (Yes, yes)
And you know I got it (Yes)
Just give me what I need (Yes, yes)

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
They split my world into pieces, I ain't heard from my nieces
I been feeling defeated, like I'm the worst in the boyband
I ain't sleep in some weekends, tryna headline both weekends
Lead my niggas, y'all sheepin', I keep the world in my hands
I know accounts should be deleted
I know some niggas should stop hitting my phone
Whenever they needing money or favors done
'Cause I'm still worried 'bout when Ashlan finna put the razor down
So I don't really give a fuck about what story they done spun
And I ain't done (No, no)
Yeah (Tell something)
And I ain't done, you heard me?
I ain't done (Yeah, I'm screaming oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
I really miss the old days before the cosigns
I really miss them cold days before the road signs
I really miss when I ain't know which way I was supposed to head
And I was pressed because my shawty gave me cold signs
I was writing poems 'bout her dawg in study hall
And she was mad 'cause I never wanna show her off (Scared)
And every time she took her bra off my dick would get soft
I thought I had a problem, kept my head inside a pillow, screaming

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
I don't wanna waste no more time
I'm ready to go
I put my life on standby
I can leave you alone

[Scratches: Kevin Abstract]

[Verse 2: Joba]
'Cause we're born with a dollar sign attached to our temple
Life is a dish served cold most times
And all my life I've taken handfuls
Force-fed by the hand that feeds us
But not all hands created equal
I stand by
Waiting for something good to come
In due time
The skies will split for the sun to smile

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
My mother called me today
She said she thought she felt my energy a country away
I apologized for not calling enough due to weight
But couldn't tell you if I kept it in my head to decay
I asked her, "Why this world love echoing hate?"
She said, "Don't let those who don't know you start dictating your fate"
I think the hardest part of love could be rebuilding the breaks
Conditioned to omit them until our foundation will shake
It's no debate
The road to peace is filled with snakes, you gotta keep your cool
And recognize the wolves that wanna try and leave you wool
Don't let 'em treat you like a window, you know you're a jewel
This world is cruel and not as simple as they teach in schools
Sometimes you gotta step away and check your own intentions
And analyze if what they do can compromise your vision
If people trust you, they don't need to question your decisions
You never needed them if they make you another villain

[Interlude: Joba, Sammy Jo & Tune Up]
Pressure
"They tried to take the bike. And they took my friend's bike and then my friend was gonna get it back but then he didn't get it back and then we had to go to the police station. And then, um, then some  (Pressure) random stranger brought back his bike. We just, you know, and we didn't tell our mums so we got in trouble (Pressure makes me—) because they found out like a day later."
Do you want to start the game again?

[Bridge: Joba]
Pressure makes me lash back, wish I could get past that
I can't take a step back, makes me wish you'd pass that
Pressure makes me lash back, wish I could get past that
I can't take a step back, makes me wish you'd pass that
Take it all, or leave it
Pressure makes, pressure makes, pressu—
Wish I could, wish I could, wish I—
I can't take, I can't take, I can't—
Makes me wish, makes me wish, makes me—
Pressure makes, pressure makes, pressu—
Wish I could, wish I could, wish I—
I can't take, I can't take, I can't—
Makes me wish, makes me wish, makes me—

[Outro: Joba]
Sipping on my pain, smoking by my pain
Ingesting my pain, I just wanna play
Sipping on my pain, smoking by my pain
Ingesting my pain, I just wanna play
Take it all, or leave it
Sipping on my (Sipping on my), smoking by my (Smoking by my)
Ingesting my (ingesting my), I just wanna (I just wanna)
Sipping on my (Sipping on my), smoking on my (Smoking by my)
Ingesting my (ingesting my), I just wanna (I just wanna)

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Seasons changing, summer starts to leave
Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, and spring
Eighty degrees, warmin' up for me
I fell deep, sun ain't have to leave
Open my eyes and see
We will float over water, leaning into shore
As we make our nirvana, sacred, so pure
Lift up the child, I know we will

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I chose not to be a slave
Dropped the Wave Runners, now we run the wave
Like we ain't had all the hood rats in Mud Rats
Like you ain't had 'em at good stats and all that
Nobody gon' ruin me
I just called my wife up, let's get Hoover free
I put all my ice up and my Louis V
I just copped my mama crib, I'm back over East
Let me get your ear like Holyfield
From the home of Soldier Field
Coming home, that's how a soldier feels
All that killin' over, that's just overkill
Yeezy back in the Chi', this that Oprah feel

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Seasons changing, summer starts to leave
Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, and spring
Eighty degrees, warmin' up for me
I fell deep, sun ain't have to leave
Open my eyes and see
We will float over water, leaning into shore
As we make our nirvana, sacred, so pure
Lift up the child, I know we will

[Open Verse]

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Seasons changing, summer starts to leave
Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, and spring
Eighty degrees, warmin' up for me
I fell deep, sun ain't have to leave
Open my eyes and see
We will float over water, leaning into shore
As we make our nirvana, sacred, so pure
Lift up the child, I know we will

[Intro]
You sound like a bitch, bitch
Shut the fuck up
When your fans become your haters
You done?
Fuckin' beard's weird
Alright
You yellin' at the mic, fuckin' weird beard (You want smoke)
We doin' this once
You yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird
Why you yell at the mic? (Illa)

[Verse]
Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, "Woo!"
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines ("Slim, you're old")—ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
…Dictionary…
"Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery," oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write "Not Alike"
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells—attempt fails! Budden—L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

[Outro]
You fuckin'—oh
And I'm just playin', Diddy
You know I love you
I am a bastard
And my name is Bill

I wake up at seven o’clock
I'd call in sick but I’m scared to talk

I hate to see you look so sad
But please don't make me feel so bad

Because I'm a bastard
And my name is Bill

I'd like to say “I wanna die”
But when I tell you I start to cry

I am a monkey whose name won't stick
But I won't charge you for this trick
Yeah, I won't charge you for this trick
I won't charge you for this trick
I won't charge you for this trick
I won't charge you for this trick
I won't charge you for this trick

[Chorus]
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you
But I love you

[Verse 1]
Always treats me like a fool
Kick me when I'm down, that's your rule
I don't know why I love you
But I love you, ooh

[Verse 2]
Oh, you never stop your cheatin' ways
With another guy, you laugh in my face
Lord, how long must I be disgraced?
'Cause I love you
Oh baby, baby, baby

[Chorus]
I don't know why I love you
I don't know
You and me, baby, oh
I don't know why I love you, baby
But I love you, baby
Oh darlin', darlin', darlin'

[Verse 3]
You throw my heart down in the dirt
Oh, ou made me crawl on this cold black earth, baby
No, I never, I never knew how much love could hurt
Oh, until I loved you, baby, 'til I loved you, baby, baby

[Verse 4]
Oh baby, I can't stop
I can't stop crying, can't you see
Here I'm pleadin on my knees, I'm on my knees
Won't you help me, help me please
'Cause I love you, I love you, baby
Woo, sure enough, baby, yeah

[Outro]
I don't know, you don't know
We don't know nothing about it
Can't do nothing about it
I don't know, baby, I don't know
Oh baby, baby, sho nuff, I love you
I don't know, you don't know
We don't know nothing about it
Can't do nothing about it
I don't know, baby, Motown can't do nothing about it
Berry can't do nothing about it
Oh baby, I don't know why I love you, baby
I don't know why I love you, love you, baby

[Verse 1]
Living the dream
At least what the dream used to be
There's people I don't know that know me
I'm quite well off, relatively
Writer's block accompanied by some depression
Without these songs, what am I worth?
If I'm not singing, no one hears my words except her

[Chorus]
My backyard tree doesn't know what she needs
Or what she wants, she just grows on
She left me so low to the ground
She left me here without a sound
Paper news and pay-per-views
They're all but gone, but my tree lives on
Asked her how she came to survive
She whispered, "The mindless will thrive"

[Verse 2]
Day one at my therapist's building
All these cars are so expensive
I guess the money brings expenses (Pay up)
So run along through this life with no sure ending
Create what you like and break the rest
There's hope for more than just the best (Probably)

[Chorus]
My backyard tree doesn't know what she needs
Or what she wants, she just grows on
She left me so low to the ground
She left me here without a sound
Paper news and pay-per-views
They're all but gone, but my tree lives on
Asked her how she came to survive
She whispered, "The mindless will thrive"

[Verse 1]
This toil's not what I'm made for
Head's not so full anymore
The load was not so hard to carry
A lack thereof brought me to my knees
You tested my maturity
The apple takes bites out of me
I wanna see a fight
I wanna see a fight
I wanna fight this setting sun
But it took far too many months to learn that suns can't be outdone
They'll burn your skin off, even the pretty ones
But they're only pretty due to pollution
What is beauty if what creates it is bad?
I'm fully here but fully sad
I want to sing but just to add to all the sounds that turn monotonous before long
And you're just like them
The trees withstand the storms, but don't assume they wouldn't like to fall
I think it would be nice to fall asleep and know that I'm not all yours
I'm not all yours
Well, there is plenty out there still to see
And you were not required to stay with me
And there's no other like you, but that's okay because there's billions like me
You were very difficult perfection, but I prefer easy mediocrity

[Bridge]
I think I know more with each stage I pass through
And I think I like the thought of not seeing you
I'm awake in the ground, the darkness soothes my eyes
And I hear shovels digging and killing the mood
But what more can I do?
I've got no more than some nights full of fun
And some popular songs and a girl that's my type
Plus a lot more who aren't in love with me
But in love with the music I write
That means something, right?
Well, they say it does
Soon as the words leave my mouth, they create a buzz
Soon as the tone leaves my voice, I start trying to sound like I'm an actual rapper
I never claimed to be
And, honestly, I never promised you anything
I don't do this for the sake of satisfying the fans
And while it's nice to know I made the song that's making them dance
I find it necessary that I say some things in advance

[Outro]
This started out as a vie for attention from an ex
And I'm the most creative when I'm an emotional wreck
Every happy song I've written ended up pretty bad
And it's hard to smile when they only cheer if you're sad
I never promised you a genre or a dance-able song
I never promised that this one wouldn't go on for too long
And I don't care if they listen
They either won't or they will
But I've been just talking for two minutes and you're listening, still

[Verse 1]
Perfume on my shirt puts me in the past
Too lonely to be happy, but too afraid to ask

[Chorus]
Here I am again, stuck in the middle
Here I am again, stuck in the middle, yeah

[Verse 2]
Too young to settle down, too old to be in bars
It's hard to take it easy, it’s easy to be hard, yeah

[Chorus]
Here I am again, stuck in the middle
Here I am again, stuck in the middle

[Bridge]
Forgive me, I am building my ship as it sails
How do I become who I wanna be while still remaining myself?

[Verse 3]
People love the old me and don't know where he's gone
Too tired to be famous, too vain to be unknown, yeah (Hey)

[Chorus]
Here I am again, stuck in the middle
Here I am again, stuck in the middle
Here I am again, stuck in the middle
(Here I am, here I am again)
(Here I am, here I am again)
Here I am again, stuck in the middle (Ahh)

[Outro]
Here I am, here I am again, here I am
Here I am, here I am again, here I am
Here I am, here I am again, here I am
Here I am, here I am again, here I am

[Intro]
Woo, woo, ah
Woo, yeah, yeah
Woo, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh huh
Yuh

[Verse]
Yeah, it’s true, the Lamborghini truck light blue (True)
The shotty down my leg and we stuck like glue (true)
My shorty like, “Damn, nobody fuck like you” (Ay, no)
One love to my uptown crew
This new shit swing like Tiger at the Masters (Uh huh)
Man, I don't fuck with none of these bastards (None of 'em)
I'm like a fucking father to these bastards (Uh)
Shut the fuck up and eat your pudding (Pudding)
Twenty alligators died for this shit I put my foot in (Foot in)
You barely got your footing, everything I did, they said I couldn't (Uh)
Now it's middle finger up with the hoodie (Uh)
Eyes dumb low blowing goodie goodie (Uh)
Baklava, bestseller (True)
How we celebrate? Went to 125 and bought a red leather (Another fact)
Man, your boy is on another planet
He just sitting in the whip by himself bumping Janet
Rhythm Nation, living life without no limitations (Uh)
Tryna have enough money that'll fill the basement (Please)
And enough drugs to fill my face with
And enough to give the M6 a facelift (Damn)
Turn that motherfucker to a spaceship (Woo, yup)
All these women calling me Taye Diggs (Uh, woo, yup)
It's me (Yeah, yup, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
And I'm just out here living my best life (It's true, oh shit, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I'm just out here living my best life (Yeah, uh, uh huh, whatever, yeah)
And I'm just out here living my best life (Uh, whatever, whatever, whatever)
But somebody always tryna fuck it up

[Intro]
E-yeah-yeah-yeah (Oh)
Whoa
E-yeah-yeah-yeah

[Verse]
I just seen lil' mama Instagram and she flexin'
Don't care about your puppy, just that ass and them breastses
Oh, girl, you a model? Damn, I never woulda guessed it
And if you tryna throw out all them vibes, I'ma catch 'em
The lifestyle we live is just too dangerous
Paranoid since they've been leakin' my shit
Wonder if it'll come out on the web
And I can't help all these bitches on my dick
Takin' a photo and postin' that shit
Comin' home late and I crawl into bed
She always be askin' me, "Where have you been?"
Whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
The world has gone to shit and we all know that
People freakin' out, like, hit the Prozac
Leon DeChino shorts got all the blogs mad
Well, fuck the internet, and you can quote that, whoa

[Chorus]
Instalove
Well, if ignorance is bliss, then don't wake me up
And I'll prolly be the last to know (Whoa)
'Cause I don't get on the internet no more
Instalove
Well, if ignorance is bliss, then don't wake me up
And I'll prolly be the last to know (Whoa)
'Cause I don't get on the internet no more

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Intro: Earl Sweatshirt]
The Wrong Tundras

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
The boy been gone a few summers
Too long for road running
Trunk full of old hundreds
Of course my old level was foggy
Grope rubbin
Don't, tell me they don't hunt us for sport I chose substances
No cuddles the bases is all covered
Niggas come in the door and smoke something
Choke up on a slugger for home run ins
Nigga its all chest thumpers
Hair 

[?]
We press up on it boy no more bluffin
Cold summers, don't tussle with strangers
Some of those keep one in the chamber
Three spliffs had my weak tips clipped
I was stuck in a hanger nigga
Muffle my pen and muzzle my brain up
Really i'm just making sure my promises kept
Chuck a deuce if you know its the end
Kept the truth and my palm in my chest
See a dude keep a noose hanging off of my neck

[Bridge: Earl Sweatshirt]
We got the juice niggas corny as shit
We on the loose niggas know what it is
We making moves, you niggas corny as shit
We got the juice niggas know what it is (yeah)

[Outro]
Days like these we know there is no hope, or at... Days like these we know there is no hope, or at least none that we can trust, all the old ways are dead or dying, and this is as it should be

[Verse 1: Taio Cruz]
I could dream of ways to see you
I could close my eyes to dream
I could fantasize about you
Tell the world what I believe
But whenever I'm not with you
It's so hard for me to see

And take a dirty picture for me, act like you're in Playboy
Show your sexy pose, with no clothes
Baby, can you do that for me?
Nice! Who looks that nice?
I double take, had to look at twice
I bet you won't look at price

Snap, uh
Click, click, snap
I don't want to lie, can we be honest?
Right now while you're sitting on my chest
I don't know what I'd do without your comfort
If you really go first, if you really left
I don't know if I would be alive today
With or without you like night and day
Read and repeat every conversation
Being with you, everyday's a Saturday
But every Sunday you've got me praying
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone
Don't leave me a-
Leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me a-
Don't leave me a-

I don't want to call and you not answer
And never see your face light up my phone
Never see you singin' Tiny Dancer
Everytime my head hurts, everytime I'm low
'Cause I don't know if I would be alive today
With or without you like night and day
Everything about you uncomplicated
Here with you, everyday's a Saturday
But every Sunday, you've got me praying
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone
Don't leave me a-
Leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me a-
Don't leave me a-
Don't you ever go
Don't you ever leave me
No
Verse 1:
I know my parents loved me
Stand behind me come what may (hmm)
I know now that I'm ready, yeah
For I finally heard them say

It's a different world (ooh ooh)
Than where ya come from
Yes it is now, yeah

Vese 2:
Here's our chance to make it
If we focus on our goal
You can dish it, we can take it (hey!)
Just remember that you've been told

Chorus:
It's a different world (it's a different world)
It's a different world (it's a different world)
Than where ya come from
Ooh ooh oooh
Than where ya come from!

[Intro: Dave Chapelle]
This is OG season
I'm your man, Dave Chapelle just shouting at everybody who went through it
Who stayed the course, who held firm
I don't know what to say, nigga, I don't know what to say

[Chorus: T.I.]
Man, what can I say?
I was just another nigga from the town
Tryin' to find a way to get paid
Man, what can I say? (What?)
Big body, 100 thousand dollar car
I pull up in new one, every day
Man, what can I say?
I'm getting too much cake for a safe
Made way more money than mistakes
Man, what can I say?
Went from a young nigga to a whole great
All in a day's work
Man, what can I say?

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Maybe, I should start with my first point
Started out selling weed in the shake joint
I went from nothing to playing on a world tour
What else could a Bankhead nigga ask for?
I will respect a hustle if you earn from it
A mistakes worth makin' if you can learn from it
I knew the sun was for sure coming
When a nigga called himself a killer but they nosey as an old woman
We had a problem, we just stole on him
And nowadays niggas found a way but no one told on 'em
He got a dub, hope they give him some parole on it
Everything glitter ain't got gold on it
Okay, now, everybody know that we don't play around
That boy be pillow-talking, beware, what you say around him
And Vera Wang and McQueen, I got nice things
Started serving these suckers 'round nineteen
I don't give a damn 'bout what you think you might seen
Look, you better clean your eyes, get some Visine
What can I say that you have not seen
Been on a cannonball run at the bag going high speed
Stop at nothing if you're out for somethin'
And my momma couch stuffed with stacks of hundreds
Safe deposit box, it's for my childrens' colleges
If you ever start a business, you won't go to college

[Chorus: T.I.]
Man, what can I say?
I was just another nigga from the town
Tryin' to find a way to get paid
Man, what can I say? (What?)
Big body, 100 thousand dollar car
I pull up in new one, every day
Man, what can I say?
I'm getting too much cake for a safe
Made way more money than mistakes
Man, what can I say?
Went from a young nigga to a whole great
All in a day's work
Man, what can I say?

[Post-Chorus: T.I.]
You can't talk to me, homie, I suggest you send your boss to me, homie
Man, what can I say?
In the Dawn with the top down on it, ducking suckers tryna block my moment
Man, what can I say?
And you gon' be mad when I get her
Sad when you found out I hit her
Man, what can I say?
I promise, it don't get no realer
Forever, been a stand up nigga
Man, what can I say?

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Walk it how you talk it, play it how it go
Learn to peep a fuck nigga with your eyes closed
Learn to turn your neighborhood from a eye sore
The real-estate people wanna come and buy more
In the trap, with a trap door
If the task force come, I'll be gone before you open that door
Gold bar buy 'em off shore
Well, you can save yourself some money on the taxes but it cost more (What?)
Lawyer doing deals on the golf course
You catch a charge, they can get it tossed for you
Throw it out, nevermind what the outcome is
You're missing game, how you listen with your mouth running
I done forever had the South running
Went to New York and hollered Bankhead, they respect where I'm comin'
From, I don't give a damn, give me my money
The country niggas over there, shawty, I'm a southern
Don't let nobody give you nothin' you ain't earn from 'em
'Less you finessing for some bags and you swerve on 'em
Forever kickin' shit, you'd think a turd on me
How you come out your fuckin' face? You got some nerve, homie
I'm only living for the rare moment
Like the time you deliver for your kid, with your word on it
When you the king and your reputation stay clean even when they try to throw dirt on it

[Chorus: T.I.]
Man, what can I say?
I was just another nigga from the town
Tryin' to find a way to get paid
Man, what can I say? (What?)
Big body, 100 thousand dollar car
I pull up in new one, every day
Man, what can I say?
I'm getting too much cake for safe
Made way more money than a mistake
Man, what can I say?
Went from a young nigga to a whole great
All in a day's work
Man, what can I say?

[Post-Chorus: T.I.]
You can't talk to me, homie, I suggest you send your boss to me, homie
Man, what can I say?
In the Dawn with the top down on it, ducking suckers tryna block my moment
Man, what can I say?
And you gon' be mad when I get her
Sad when you found out I hit her
Man, what can I say?
I promise, it don't get no realer
Forever, been a stand up nigga
Man, what can I say?

Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
While we all sup sorrow with the poor
There’s a song that will linger forever in our ears
Oh, hard times, come again no more

'Tis the song, the sign of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh hard times, come again no more

While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
There are frail forms fainting at the door
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say
Oh, hard times, come again no more

'Tis the song, the sign of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh hard times, come again no more

There’s a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away
With a worn heart, whose better days are o'er
Though her voice it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day
Oh, hard times, come again no more
'Tis the song, the sign of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh hard times, come again no more

'Tis the song, the sign of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh hard times, come again no more
Oh, we hear church people say
They are in this holy way
There are strange things happening everyday

On that last great judgment day
When they drive them all away
There are strange things happening everyday

Everyday
(Everyday)
Everyday

There are strange things happening everyday

Everyday

There are strange things happening everyday

If you want to view the climb
You must learn to quit your lyin'
There are strange things happening everyday
If you hew right to the line
You can live right all the time
There are strange things happening everyday

Everyday

I'm a drifter, a driftin' drifter
Got no place to call my home no more
I'm a wanderer, a wandering wanderer
Got no one to call my own no more

Got no strings to tie me down
Got no cause to hang around
What difference does it make which way I go
Got an empty feelin' down inside
Still I need to stay alive
And who can tell what waits beyond this road
I'm a drifter, a driftin' drifter
Got no one to call my own no more

Got no strings to tie me down
Got no cause to hang around
What difference does it make which way I go
Got an empty feelin' deep inside
Still I need to stay alive
Who can tell what waits beyond this road
I'm a drifter, a driftin' drifter
Got no one to call my own no more
Got no place to call my home no more
That big eight-wheeler rollin' down the track
Means your true lovin' daddy ain't comin' back
I'm movin' on, I'm movin' on
You were flyin' too high, for my little old sky
And I'm movin' on

That big loud whistle as it blew and blew
Said hello to the southland, we're comin' to you
I'm movin' on, oh, hear my song
You had the laugh on me, now I'm settin' you free
And I'm movin' on

Mister fireman, won't you please listen to me
Cause I got a pretty mama in Tennessee
I'm movin' on, keep rollin' on
You gotta shovel the coal, let this rattler roll
Keep movin' on

Mister Engineer, take that throttle in hand
This rattler the fastest in the southern land
Keep movin' me on, I stayed away too long
You gonna ease my mind and put me there on time
And keep movin' on
I've told you baby, from time to time
You just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
I'm movin' on, I'm movin' on
You've broken your vow and it's all over now
I'm movin' on

You've switched your engine now I ain't got time
For a triflin' woman on my main line
I'm movin' on, you done your daddy wrong
I warned you twice, now you can settle the price
But keep movin' on

But someday baby, when you've had your play
You want your daddy but your daddy will say
Keep movin' on, you stayed away too long
I'm through with you, too bad you're blue
Keep movin' on

[Verse 1: Johnny Cash]
I met you in the shadows and your face was all aglow
I remember it so well, though it was many years ago
We both knew something happened without a lot to say
But we had other lives and so we went our separate ways
But our hearts communicated and every time we passed
We were gradually building something that would forever last

[Chorus: Johnny Cash and June Carter Nash]
As long
(As long)
As the moon
(As the moon)
Shall rise
(As the moon shall rise)
As long
(As long)
As the rivers
(As the rivers)
Flow
(As the rivers flow)
As long
(As long)
As the sun
(As the sun)
As the sun will shine
As long
As the grass
Shall grow

[Verse 2: Johnny Cash]
My heart was calling for you when one night you came along
We danced around each other but then we sang our song
Our harmony was shaky, and the pitch not very true
But then, you gave in to me and I gave in to you
We had to fight the world and we fought with all we had
We vowed to be together through the sweet times and the bad

[Chorus: Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash]
As long
(As long)
As the moon
(As the moon)
Shall rise
(As the moon shall rise)
As long
(As long)
As the rivers
(As the rivers)
Flow
(As the rivers flow)
As long
(As long)
As the sun
(As the sun)
Will shine
As long
As the grass
Shall grow

[Verse 3: Johnny Cash]
I hear you whisper every night: "May I have this dance?"
And though I'm not light on my feet I always take the chance
We've gone through many storms and often walked through fire
But always our loving faith took us higher and higher
We know the mystery of life, it's love hard and long
(I love you)
I love you and I always will. As long...

[Chorus: Johnny Cash and June Carter Nash]
As long
(As long)
As the moon
(As the moon)
Shall rise
(As the moon shall rise)
As long
(As long)
As the rivers
(As the rivers)
Flow
(As the rivers flow)
As long
(As long)
As the sun
(As the sun)
Will shine
As long
As the grass
Shall grow
With the twilight colors falling
And the evening laying shadows
Hidden memories come stealing from my mind
And I feel my own heart beating out
The simple joy of living
And I wonder how I ever was that kind
But the wild road I was rambling
Was always out there calling
And you said a hundred times I should have died
Then you reached down and touched me
And lifted me up with you
So I believe it was a road I was meant to ride

I'm like a soldier getting over the war
I'm like a young man getting over his crazy days
Like a bandit getting over his lawless ways
I don't have to do that anymore
I'm like a soldier getting over the war

There are nights I don't remember
And pain that's been forgotten
And a lot of things I choose not to recall
There are faces that come to me
In my darkest secret memories
Faces that I wish would not come back at all
But in my dreams parade of lovers
From the other times and places
There's not one that matters now, no matter who
I'm just thankful for the journey
And that I've survived the battles
And that my spoils of victory is you
I'm like a soldier getting over the war
I'm like a young man getting over his crazy days
Like a bandit getting over his lawless ways
Every day gets better than the day before
I'm like a soldier getting over the war
Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus: Kanye West & Chance The Rapper]
Where I'm from, I know people just do (Do it)
We don't try (Hol' up)
We don't even stop speak, no lies (Hey)
We coupe, on the troop, my eyes (My eye, my eyes)
The truth is not in the words, it's in my eyes (Woo)
The truth is not in the words, it's in my eyes
The truth is not in the words (Hey)
The truth...

[Intro]
Like a bird on a wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free

[Verse]
Like a fish on a hook
Like a knight from an old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons with thee
And if I have been unkind
I hope that you will just let it go by
And if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you
Like a baby stillborn
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me
But I swear by this song
By all I have done wrong
I'll make it all up to you
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch
He called out to me "Don’t ask for so much"
And a young man leaning on his darkened door
He cried out to me "Hey, why not ask for more"

[Outro]
Like a bird on a wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free

I'm Weezy baby, no hard labor
I beat it up, I throw haymakers
And I ain't tryna be a heartbreaker
And that's word to the pacemakers
I'll shake her off like a salt shaker
If she ain't tryna be a team player
We could watch what we had go up in flames
That's cremation
I'm bein' patient when we embracin'
We just kick it 'til my knee in braces
But I close my eyes and start seein' faces
Of all the bitches that she replacin'
And my old hoes will be elated
To have the chance to be reinstated
And these new hoes will be elated
To have the chance to be my latest, and that's real

[Intro]
You know what the fuck goin' on, man
You better strap in your seat
Well, it's gon' be a rough ride
It's the king, bitch
(Just Blaze)

[Verse 1]
No introduction really necessary
Get the message like a secretary
Boy, I'm legendary
When I'm dead and buried, still be kicking flavor in the cemetery
Trap music originator, fresh off of my hiatus
Yellin', 'Fuck you' to all of my haters, they Skywalker, I'm Darth Vader
Promise, I don't give a shit about 'em
Let 'em know, turn him red, tell 'em he don't even matter, yeah!
Like I'm pimpin in a Kangol and a new Cadillac with some all gold hammer
Long as I remember, I done ran Atlanta
I could give a damn 'bout a dog faced hoe
Sister used to gettin' thangs from a check, so how can I
Settin' numbers in the hood, do what I say do
Tell 'em niggas break bread or fake dead
Or bare it, they hate that, 50 million, yeah, died to make that
Middle finger, if you vote for Trump, see me outside well you know what's up
I ain't hearing no peace talk, ain't shit funny, no hee-haw
Like a Black Panther, we armed to the teeth, cracker tried me, we squeeze off
Swear to God, I could've been Freddie Gray or Mike Brown gettin' shot down
With a pistol on me and a half a brick of yay, blam-blammin' by Sandra Bland
Listen, boy, your challenge with the runnin' man
I will challenge with a gun in hand
What you see before you, fuck what they done told you
Bitch I brought this shit from nothin', man
Grand Hustle over errythang, Molly, Becky and the Mary-Jane
It's the king, nigga like a 18-wheeler swervin' in and out of every lane
Never been a part of they in-crowd, got a problem with me? I say, 'Fuck y'all'
Got the same friend that I came in with, duckin' all that lame shit, ayy
Everyone I know is on go, drive-bys all rolled in a 4 by 4
Believe, if I catch him, that the hoe gon' go
See me with it, you ain't gon' see the hoe no more
They love when I talk that shit
Roll by the car lot, went and bought that shit
Caught case after case and I fought that shit
Then watch he give a damn, went and off that brick
I lived the shit that they rappin' 'bout
Care nuttin' 'bout what they cappin' 'bout
Bankroll mama, we know what this, we cashin' out, we baggin' up
Stackin' up them zeroes, certified neighborhood hero
You can try one of them sucka niggas, better not try it with me though
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Bridge]
You know you done fucked up, don'cha?
You know you done fucked up, don'cha?
Ain't no stoppin' this shit, partna
And you know what happened if you run me hot in this bitch, now

[Verse 2]
We turned to the max, Atlanta hat
Cocked to the left, turned to the back
Nigga tried, see, we weren't havin' that
Send shots where your bandana at
Drop a nigga off where Alabama at
That's what nigga get for tryna battle rap
Head shot, should be one and done
No drive-by, but we run and gun
A nigga walk up to you, while you showin' off stunts
Tell you, "Up your jewelry, nigga, run that money"
Nigga playin' games, think it sure not funny
'Til my young nigga went and done it for me, yeah
For the love of the bankroll, keep your business to yourself
Nigga, don't nobody care 'bout it
Don't nobody wanna hear 'bout it
You got problems, huh? Well, it's the same thing for everybody
And, nigga, I ain't gon' lie, I promise, not a day go by
I ain't on the grind, if I ain't on fire
If any thing that I want, I can go buy
Tryna put six wheels on a Range Rover
I ain't playin' no games, not with you, no sir
If you think you're at the top, tell 'em move over
Modern 2Pac and the new Hova, goddamn
Know the hustle now, come with us and down
We dodgin' suckas, steady duckin' clowns
We chasing mills so we can put that down
Bullshit talk but we run that town
But with millions and no cap and gown
Went from trappin' raw, look what happen now
Metal throne, concrete crown
Cross that line, you're gettin' beat down
Real dope boy veteran, dope boy academy
These dope fiends still remember me when they were sick and needed their medicine
You better watch it partner, you ain't' from 'round here
Think it's sweet, you got the wrong idea
Get stripped naked, left out there, tell 'em, "So, what the fuck I care?"
'Bout the trap music, all black Uzi, still packin', I'm that stupid
Still down to do it, if you act stupid, get locked up and get back to it, yeah
Trap music, all black Uzi, get locked up and get back to it, yeah

[Intro: T.I.]
Some shit never change, nigga
Aha, ayy, yeah

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Frank Muller, put one, two to your medulla
Oblongata, there is none hotter
I'm so in love witcha girl, it's just somethin' 'bout her
I'm havin' fun with her, you better come get her
I fuck her face, bust one on her concealer
And make another girl lick it off, I'ma dumb nigga
Since a young nigga, I've been a made man
My bitches come with fat ass and a spray tan
Spend a whole bag, then run up more
I won a 100K shootin' dice, 10 to 4
Playing poker, put the sack up, go all in
Lose, double down, win, go to Dubai
If you wanna win big, the risk gotta be high
Want them bad bitches all on your dick, you gotta be fly
Yeah, he cool but he not a T.I., I will be damned
Watch him do designer drugs by the gram, get what they asked for
Life be action packed but don't nothin' distract from the cash flow
Dope boy fashion, avoid fuck boys, hate 'em with a passion
I'm sucka-duckin' gettin' money, a hard dick all a bitch got comin', yeah

[Chorus: T.I. & Jeezy]
All I know is more & more (aha)
Goin' to the grave 'fore I'm going broke
Do it all against the odds, baby, lord knows
Puttin' on, homie, that's what I was born for (You know what this is)
Hunnid bands (Yeah)
All I know is more & more (Aha) (Wassup)
Goin' to the grave 'fore I'm going broke (Tip, I got you, nigga)
Do it all against the odds, baby, lord knows
Puttin' on, homie, that's what I was born for (You, know what this is)
Hunnid bands

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Dope boy, bitch I ain't got to say it again
It's the king and the don, you gotta play it again
Drop the top, lace your boots up, grab your scale
All you see are triples Es like you're weighin' a whale
See, I'm straight up out the gutter, it ain't hard to tell
Flex, made that yellow butter, it ain't hard to sell
Thirty rounds up on my hip, make it hard to walk (Damn)
Caller from a private number, make it hard to stalk
Drop the top on a 'Rari, nigga, I'm so made
Left the Dawn in the Bend, Dade, I'm so paid
And she came to the mansion, yeah, the bitch got slayed
Skinny dippin' in the pool yeah, lil bitch got saved, huh

[Chorus: T.I. & Jeezy]
All I know is more & more (Aha)
Goin' to the grave 'fore I'm going broke
Do it all against the odds, baby, lord knows
Puttin' on, homie, that's what I was born for
Hunnid bands (Yeah)
All I know is more & more (Aha) (More & more)
Goin' to the grave 'fore I'm going broke
Do it all against the odds, baby, lord knows
Puttin' on, homie, that's what I was born for
Hunnid bands

[Verse 3: T.I.]
All I know is get this check and the respect
Fly the family from Atlanta to Hawaii and back
Why would you act slow? No, I'm not an asshole
Get your ass blown smooth off for doin' too much
Had it with the other nigga that was tryna move up
It is what is, ain't no way to make a do-up
Better know that we was sellin' crack until we blew up
Was trappin', everybody knew us and then the mill' came
Done been through so much shit that I'm numb to it, don't feel pain
Just heard Urban Legend the other day and it still bang
Get a hustle (Get it)
Make it double, want some weight, you need some bigger muscles (You need it)
Finesse the plan, then work your way throughout the filibuster
Tryin' not to kill a sucka, that's a hard job (Ya dig)
But I'ma still try my hand with a card shark
Boy, I've been gettin' it out the mud since 14, makin' it do what it does
True trap nigga

[Chorus: T.I. & Jeezy]
All I know is more & more (Aha)
Goin' to the grave 'fore I'm going broke
Do it all against the odds, baby, lord knows
Puttin' on, homie, that's what I was born for (You know what this is)
Hunnid bands (Yeah)
All I know is more & more (Aha) (More & more)
Goin' to the grave 'fore I'm going broke
Do it all against the odds, baby, lord knows
Puttin' on, homie, that's what I was born for, uh huh
Hunnid bands
All I know is

[Outro: T.I.]
Some more and some more is all I know, man
You know what I mean?
Been big shit poppin' for a long time, you understand that?
Hey, we do this shit for bread and meat; we don't win then we don't eat, you understand?
Yeah, yeah, talk while we spit is what we do all day, man
I mean, try to be humble as I can be
But truth be told, none of you nigga can fuck with me, you understand that?
It's the motherfuckin' king, nigga
Come hell or high water, accept no substitution
Stay solid all the way through it
Fuck what a hater got to say
What I did, can nobody undo
Build this shit with my bare hands, man
Bare witness to the greatness
It's upon you
This is the Dime Trap

[Verse 1]
Goddamn, man-child
You fucked me so good that I almost said "I love you"
You're fun and you’re wild
But you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through
Your poetry's bad and you blame the news
But I can’t change that, and I can't change your mood, ah

[Chorus]
'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue, blue

[Verse 2]
Goddamn, man-child
You act like a kid even though you stand six foot two
Self-loathing poet, resident Laurel Canyon know-it-all
You talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you
But I don't get bored, I just see it through
Why wait for the best when I could have you? You?

[Chorus]
'Cause you’re just a man
It’s just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue
You make me blue

[Outro]
Blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator & Choir]
You're a mean one
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel
Mr. Grinch, you're a bad banana
(Mr. Grinch), with the greasy black peel
You're a vile one
You got termites in your smile
You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile (Mr. Grinch)
You’re a foul one
Friends you don’t have none
I wouldn't touch you with a 39-and-a-half foot pole!
You're a monster
Your heart's an empty hole
You got garlic (You got garlic) in your soul
You got garlic in your soul

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator & Choir]
All them smiles homie
I turn 'em to frowns
All them decorations
I tear 'em down
You can ask Max, I don't play around
Ayo (Ew...)
Who is this mean fellow
With his skin all green and his teeth all yellow? (Ew...)
What you so mad for?
Halloween come around and we ain't knockin' at your door, mane

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Choir]
Mr. Grinch, you're a bad banana
You're gonna spoil everybody with your bad attitude
(Spoil everybody)
Mr. Grinch
La-la-la
Who is this mean fellow
With his skin all green and his teeth all yellow?
(La-la-la-la)
What you so mad for?
Halloween come around and we ain't knockin' at your door!
(La-la)
Bad banana

[Verse]
Young Draco nigga, you know I'm real nigga
I slide in that Bentley, they think I'm drug dealer
Jump out the top and my young nigga flip the switch
Quarter million in one day just to be specific
Fuck with Draco nigga I empty the clip
Had to go run it up, trappin' through the 6
Hop out the Rari, I look like the man
Round 250,000 on my Instagram
Look at it bitch, she staring, she my biggest fan
Whippin' my wrist in the pot like a ceiling fan
Who is him? I ain't ever heard of him
Make the wrong move then you know Draco's shoota gon murder him
Hop in the Lamborghini then I swerve on 'em
Junkie hit my front door, know what I'm servin' him
Front door back door, with the draco
Front door back door, front door back door
Trappin' a nigga runnin' up them pesos
Call up my plug he gon pull up with a whole case load
Stackin' up M&M's just like they Lego's
Call up my shooters, they shoot when I say so
Fuck with Lil Soulja, I'm sprayin' with the draco
Servin' the junkies, run up a bankroll
Ballin' on niggas, I sprained my ankle
Ran up them M's, nigga I got pesos
Fuck with the gang and we shootin' shit up
Fuck on yo bitch, you know what's up
I do a show, I'm on a tour bus
I'm in LA, now I'm up in New York
Fifty thousand in one day, that's just Soulja
Young nigga puttin' them bricks in a Rover
VVS diamonds, they come out the water
Young Draco nigga, I'm fuckin' yo daughter
Young Draco nigga, Ferrari the sport
Young Draco nigga trappin fuck nigga, come place yo order
Titanic my chain, put it in the water
VVS Audemars look like some coke
Young Draco pull up shootin' shit at that Madi Gras
I take a brick, ship it to Panama
100 bricks, put it in my momma house
Whip out that draco like what they talkin' bout?

[Intro: Rihanna & Hins Cheung]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
That's how much I love you (yeah, yeah)
That's how much I need you (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Rihanna & Hins Cheung]
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No)
我也失望
相處那麼長 相好那麼短
總是在親吻中善忘 討厭那快感
把錯誤都給遺忘
(But I hate it)
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
(But I hate it)
你的指尖擦過臉龐
就忘了爭吵的損傷 就像矛盾
都與我們的未來無關

[Chorus: Rihanna & (Hins Cheung)]
And I hate how much I love you, boy (yeah)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy (oh whoa)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so (oh)

[Verse 2: Rihanna & Hins Cheung]
你明白你擅長 把弄我的遐想
從苦痛變換成狂歡
Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I (I)
Love you beyond the reason why (why)
And it just ain't right

[Chorus: Hins Cheung & (Rihanna)]
And I hate how much I love you girl (oooh)
恨自己一邊愛一邊忍受 (yeah)
And I hate how much I love you girl (yeah)
愛恨都是種挑逗 (oooh)
But I hate that I love you so

[Bridge: Hins Cheung & Rihanna]
One of these days, maybe your magic won't affect me (no)
And your kiss won't make me weak
我的思想 都被困在
你能透視的目光
美麗的咒語 已種在我身上
Yeah, ooh
Hate that I love you so

[Chorus: Rihanna & Hins Cheung / Both]
That's how much I love you
As much as I need you
How much I need you
How much I love you
That's how much I love you
Oh, I need you
That's how much I need you
I need you
And I hate that I love you so
And I hate how much I love you girl
I can't stand how much I need you
(I can't stand how much I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy
But I just can't let you go
(But I just can't let you go)
And I hate that I love you so (Ohhh)
And I hate that I love you so, so

[Intro: Rihanna & Hins Cheung]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
That's how much I love you (yeah, yeah)
That's how much I need you (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Rihanna & Hins Cheung]
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No)
為我設想
別叫我歡暢 可惜親吻你
忘掉在溫馨中帶涼
視你如偶像 忘掉這麼想最傷
(But I hate it)
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
(But I hate it)
事實是你一刻技癢
便自動勾起我幻想 消失智商
自問我討厭這份遐想

[Chorus: Rihanna & (Hins Cheung)]
And I hate how much I love you, boy (yeah)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy (oh whoa)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so (oh)

[Verse 2: Rihanna & Hins Cheung]
實在你也知道
我開心因見到
平和地相處的美好
Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I (I)
Love you beyond the reason why (why)
And it just ain't right

[Chorus: Hins Cheung & (Rihanna)]
And I hate how much I love you girl (oooh)
我未能拋得開痛著醉倒 (yeah)
And I hate how much I love you girl (yeah)
無法遺失的擁抱 (oooh)
But I hate that I love you so

[Bridge: Hins Cheung & Rihanna]
One of these days, maybe your magic won't affect me (no)
And your kiss won't make me weak
最恨世上 講相知
得你能透視至此
大概這點心意 像咒語玩意
Yeah, ooh
Hate that I love you so

[Chorus: Rihanna & Hins Cheung / Both]
That's how much I love you
As much as I need you
How much I need you
How much I love you
That's how much I love you
Oh, I need you
That's how much I need you
I need you
And I hate that I love you so
And I hate how much I love you girl
I can't stand how much I need you
(I can't stand how much I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy
But I just can't let you go
(But I just can't let you go)
And I hate that I love you so (ohhh)
And I hate that I love you so, so

[Verse 1]
Does she dress in cool clothes? Did you meet in Paris?
Bet she's beautiful and perfect, everything I'm not
Wish that I could find out all your little secrets
Talking like a psychopath, I know I've gotta stop

[Pre-Chorus]
Head against the wall
I've been here before
I can't let you go

[Chorus]
It's hard but it's true
I can't stop myself from thinking 'bout you
It's hard but it's true
I can't stop myself from thinking 'bout you
But you're thinking 'bout someone new
But you're thinking 'bout someone new

[Verse 2]
In New York, 3AM, I'm sleepless
It's like I can't escape your face, I see you everywhere
You're standing in the spotlight
It's like you're on the TV
I'm checking every window I walk past in case you're there

[Pre-Chorus]
Head against the wall
I've been here before
I can't let you go

[Chorus]
It's hard but it's true
I can't stop myself from thinking 'bout you
It's hard but it's true
I can't stop myself from thinking 'bout you
But you're thinking 'bout someone new
But you're thinking 'bout someone new

[Bridge]
I still wear your T-shirt in my bed
Ooh, it feels so good when you're inside my head
It's hard but it's true
I can't stop myself from thinking bout you

[Chorus]
It's hard but it's true
I can't stop myself from thinking 'bout you
It's hard but it's true
I can't stop myself from thinking 'bout you
But you're thinking 'bout someone new
But you're thinking 'bout someone new

[Verse]
Boy, you really messed around
Put me six feet underground
Always kick me when I'm down
But I'm still driving through your town
I wish that you could wear my crown
And feel the weight I'm feeling now
But I can't help but say your name
It's lightning when you're in my veins

[Pre-Chorus]
Tried to fake it, I can't take it
Boy you trapped my heart
I can't shake it, 'bout to break into a hundred million parts

[Chorus]
I need your love
I need it even when it hurts me
I won't give up
I won't give up, so come and get me
I need your love
I need it even when it hurts me
I won't give up
I won't give up, so come and get me

[Verse]
Boy, you really messed around
Put me six feet underground
Always kick me when I'm down
But I'm still driving through your town

[Pre-Chorus]
Tried to fake it, I can't take it
Boy you trapped my heart
I can't shake it, 'bout to break into a hundred million parts

[Chorus]
I need your love
I need it even when it hurts me
I won't give up
I won't give up, so come and get me

[Bridge]
Boy, you really broke my heart
Took my love and tore it up
But I'm coming back for you
Coming clean out of the blue
All the things you did to me
I forgive them quietly
But I will never forget
And still I end up in your bed

[Chorus]
I need your love (I don't want it)
I need it even when it hurts me (You really hurt me, baby)
I won't give up (Now, I'm giving up)
I won't give up, so come and get me (Don't you come and get me, baby)
I need your love (I don't want it)
I need it even when it hurts me (You really hurt me, baby)
I won't give up (Now, I'm giving up)
I won't give up, so come and get me (Don't you come and get me, baby)

[Verse 1]
Let us be wrong and let's begin
A mistake that turns into perfection
I want to see you sliding in my underworld
This time I plan to let you in
I'll be a victim of my own invention
Let us be wrong and let's begin
Once and for all

[Pre-Chorus]
What heaven weaves and braids
No man shall undo
And I've been custom-made for no one but you
You know it's now or never

[Chorus]
I have a feeling inside
(Despacio, despacio, comienzas a caer)
And intuition's always been a woman's guide
(Te siento, te siento, desde antes de nacer)
We've been wanting each other since before we were born
(Adentro, adentro te vas quedando)
And I will want you even after I am gone
(Así, estoy dispuesta a todo amor)

[Verse 2]
This time I plan to let you in
I'll be here in full subordination
I'll be devoted to your will
Once and for all

[Pre-Chorus]
Love is only pain disguised as a kiss
So make me feel it now
Let's get on with this
And the sooner the better

[Chorus]
I have a feeling inside
(Despacio, despacio, comienzas a caer)
And intuition's always been a woman's guide
(Te siento, te siento, desde antes de nacer)
We've been wanting each other since before we were born
(Adentro, adentro te vas quedando)
And I will want you even after I am gone
(Así, estoy dispuesta a todo)

I have a feeling inside
(Despacio, despacio, comienzas a caer)
And intuition's always been a woman's guide
(Te siento, te siento, desde antes de nacer)
We've been wanting each other since before we were born
(Adentro, adentro te vas quedando)
And I will love you even after I am gone
After I am gone

[Verse 1: Jazze Pha]
Like no pressure (no pressure!)
Like a pistol out the top dresser (pew!)
My shit bang, I get cash, all hunnid dollar bills, no chingaling
Cool like the other side of the pillow (aye!)
Caddy got white walls on it (skrr, skrrt!)
Big daddy got ice all on me (blingin')
Super clean like Lysol, homie (ooh)
You say it’s some 

[?], I say it's a shame, but you would give me your body before your name
And I don't know why
And I can’t explain
I, spin around like Michael Jackson (uh-huh!)
Reminisce 'cause I'm 'bout that action (uh, nah!)
Just wanna give some satisfaction!

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract  & Jazze Pha]
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
Put my dogs in a pack formation
Niggas say my name when they agitated
Nigga learn better, you can ask yo' lady
Pretty bad thang, wanna have my baby
Nigga I'm rich, I’m just actin’ broke
I don't understand what you hate me for...

Pouring rain, it's pouring rain out
I'm afraid I might forget
What if the good memories start to fade out?
Things change, yeah
But I get flashes of home now and then
In my head
Do you remember my Civic?
Dark green, dark green
With tan seats, tan seats and no A/C
It was sweet to me

[Chorus]
I had a wide angle, smile and a mouth full of gold
Candy eyes, candle eyes burning bright down the road
Through Carolina, warm air Carolina

[Verse 2]
Slowly, yeah
Days get grayed out
What if I can't fix my head
What if I can't fix my head now
I don't wanna forget us with

[Chorus]
The wide angle smile and a mouth full of gold
Candy eyes, candle eyes burning bright down the road
Through Carolina, warm air Carolina
I had a wide angle smile and a mouth full of gold
Candy eyes, candle eyes burning bright down the road
Through Carolina, warm air Carolina
Ninety-five, ninety-five, ninety

[Verse 3]
I found a photograph, all faded and bunched
I had a camo hat, leaning on a red truck
On Nico's red truck
He moved to Baltimore City, then he moved to Philly
We don't speak much, the last year's been so busy
I can't keep up, the years move by so quickly
I can't keep up, I can't keep up
I rode my bike to the YMCA
Got my first pay-check from working the day-care
It got wet, 'cause it rained on the way back
But I loved the smell, so I just inhaled
I stopped in a field for a minute when night fell
The big moon burned and the rim of the bike wheel
Was white from reflecting
I don't wanna forget the way it felt
One summer, hot, slow, wet
I had a wide angle smile in these pictures that you took
It's strange, I forget that's how I looked
It's strange how much can change in just a short time
It's strange I'm getting older, I'm afraid
I found a photograph all faded and bunched
I had a camo hat, leaning on a red truck
On my friend's red truck
On my friend's red truck

[Intro: Yaeji]

Bedsheets turn to a white dress

I am the Grinch, Cindy Lou who?
I live in Who-ville, who are you?
I got a dog, his name is Max
Coffee in my cup, that is a fact
I was in snow, ain't need a coat
Max with the sled, off with their head
I don't like love, I don't like fun
When I'm around, Christmas is done

Don't knock, no gifts over here

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]

You can take that over there and I don't really care
Tell your homeboy in the red suit to chill

[Pre-Chorus]
I pulled up a foreign, they told me it's okay
No-no, no, no-no, I never went, no-no
I'm coppin' a four-door, a-dunna-dun-dun-dun
They coppin' them commas, yeah
Now I watch it unfold at the top of that, oh
And I lie on the run, run, run
And I watch it unfold at the top that, oh
And I lie on that run, you mo'fucker

[Chorus]
Wake me up from this nightmare that I live
It's something inside of me keeps on givin' in, ayy, ayy
Wake me up from this dream that never ends
Haunting me, haunting me 'til my bitter end, ayy
Wake me up from this dream that never ends
Something inside of me keeps on givin' in, ayy, ayy

[Bridge]
It ain't over, no, it ain't over
No, it ain't over

Wake me up from this dream that never ends
Haunting me, haunting me 'til my bitter end, ayy
Wake me up from this dream that never ends
Something inside of me keeps on givin' in, ayy, ayy

[Verse]
I don't know how to cop no foreign
I don't know when another man comes
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know when another man comes
And I wanna wonder when the pain will stop
And I wanna wonder when I paid a lot
And I wanna wonder when the pain will stop
Oh, ohh, oh, woah

[Outro]
Wake me up from this nightmare that I live
It's something inside of me keeps on givin' in

[Chorus: Reginae Carter]
Welcome to your name in lights
All the lighters in the sky (Yeah)
You must be famous
This is how you live your life, different city every night (Yeah)
You must be famous, famous

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'ma be on the TV, mama, Pac voice
People point at me, say, "Oh my God"
They got a point
Tried to blow my nose and blew my mind
It's mind-blowing
And gold diggers dig until they find oil
And I'm sittin' here reading what was written 'bout what I do, what I didn't
I ruined relationships before my image, but
All I ever wanted was everybody's attention
'Cause most people are nobody 'til somebody kill 'em
Probably thought that my career be short and sweet
Wishin' I was in your shoes, I'd take them off and find a beach
And superstars don't sparkle, we high-beam
And you can't spell fame, without me
And may my Hall of Fame speech be short and sweet
Like, "Thank God, fuck fame, and thank me"
'Cause superstars don't sparkle, superstars beam
I was your main man, 'til I went mainstream
I'ma be on the TV, mama

[Chorus: Reginae Carter & Lil Wayne]
Welcome to your name in lights (Woo!)
All the lighters in the sky (I must be famous)
You must be famous (Yeah, oh my God I must be famous)
This is how you live your life (Yeah)
Different city every night (I must be famous)
You must be famous, famous

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Rich and famous, it's better to be rich and famous
Message to my lawyer: "Don't let me make these bitches famous"
You know entertainers, sex, drugs and entertainment get so instantaneous
Simultaneous, miscellaneous, party long and hard
And pray death is quick and painless
Livin' in the spotlight, twist the light bulb when it's blinking
I'm never alone
I got my demons and my angels
Can't talk to myself, 'cause mama said don't talk to strangers
Relatives; ain't seen 'em since the grass been greener
And some people say I changed but they can't hear me jingle
I want Tina and Nancy, I get Nancy and Tina
Never question myself, unless I ask, "Am I dreamin'?"
The fan mail and subpoenas, jail cells to arenas
Car wash to the cleaners, Walmart to Neiman's
They told me time would tell
I told time to kiss my ass
And I heard, "Can you look this way? Can you look this way?"
Flash! I must be famous

[Chorus: Reginae Carter & Lil Wayne]
Welcome to your name in lights (Yeah!)
All the lighters in the sky (You must be famous)
You must be famous (I'ma be on the TV, mama!)
This is how you live your life (Yeah, yeah)
Different city every night (Oh my God, I must be famous)
You must be famous, famous

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
You probably thought that my career, be short and sweet
You wish that I was in your shoes, I'd take them off 'cause life's a beach
And superstars don't sparkle, we shine deep
And you can't spell fame, without me
And may my Hall of Fame speech be short and sweet
Like, "Thank God, fuck fame, and thank me"
'Cause superstars don't twinkle, superstars gleam
I was your main man, 'til I went mainstream
I'ma be on the TV, mama

[Chorus: Reginae Carter & Lil Wayne]
Welcome to your name in lights
All the lighters in the sky (Oh my God, I must be famous)
You must be famous (Oh my God, I must be famous)
This is how you live your life
Different city every night (Oh my God, I must be famous)
You must be famous, famous

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
I'ma be on the TV, mama
Kiss my motherfuckin' ass

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Oh, you ain't heard?
Him and dopeman ain't cool no more
'Cause dopeman tried to charge him double for the usual
Damn
You just don't hear good news no more
After I tell this story, I gotta kill who I told
Okay, his new package had came in
Had the whole house stankin'
Traphouse doorbell ringin'
Traphouse gettin' too famous
His traphouse poppin' all night
The porch light should be strobe lights
That shit them police don't like
You know them pigs no good like pork rinds
Gotta go home to that whore wife
That don't never wan' fuck, just start fights
And he just made a hard right at the wrong time
They pulled him over, if they only write him a ticket, he'll be alright
Yeah, right
‘Cause you know he fit the description of a black male that sell white
AK on the backseat
Trunk full of cocaína
He stepped on the gas and got ghost on 'em
His bitch scream like she seen one
He said, “Shut up while I speed up”
She said, “I think you lost 'em," now he think he lost 'em
Now he lost his train of thought
The voice in his head said, “All aboard”
And he woke up, don't listen to that bitch
She coked up off of his stuff
And he know it's good
Where the popcorn? This story good, call Hollywood
But anyway, let a nigga get back to it
He came to a neighborhood and he zig-zagged through it
He didn't see the lights, but he still heard the sirens
Cut off all his lights and they drove right by him, woo
Chapter two
Traphouse just got cable
Stuntin' on the neighbors
The cable man was the feds though
A four-year-old was in bed though
He woke up when he heard the Glocks cock
You wouldn't believe what happened ten seconds later
To be continued, dot, dot, dot

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Ten seconds left, he gon' get it
Mag in his mouth, mean like a fitted
Caught him in the pool room, two to his head
In the room and boom, they did it, wow
Face on the ground, Ace of Spade on the ground
Run, bullets, they'll chase you around
Don't listen to me, these niggas ain't playin'
Yo, they'll lace 'em down, feel it
One hit Willy
Other nigga live with a milli
Other nigga ride him Phillies
Run through the hood, all blood, blowin' bills on grils
Just chillin' up in New York City
One got witty
Took his mask off, he a dumbass
Got him on viddy
Somebody yelled out, “Yo, that's 'Chelle”
Blaow, blaow, caught her in the titty, huh
Four more shells went to his face like gazelles
Bloody, they laced him up well
Niggas stop shootin', get the loot
Stop bullshittin', boy, you wild, stop playin' yourself
This ain't good, now they fucked
Police barricade the buildin', what?
Now we stuck
Now this clown-ass nigga just fucked us all up (Up)
Eleven more shots
Came to the door was the cops
Chain popped off, caught him in his top
Fell to the floor, damn four-year-old shorty just looked up
Said, “They got you”
Damn, another nigga dead
Another nigga head licked, damn, they copped out
What's it all about, kid?
Max out, shed, play the background, we's out
Mwah

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
There's always more to the story (To the story)
There's always more to the story
You ain't hear it from me (Hear it from me)
And what you hear, don't repeat (Don't repeat)
Or disappear in your sleep
And you ain't hear this from me (This from me)
There's always more to the story (To the story)
And that's the moral to the story
Nigga, listen to me (Listen to me)
Fuck what you hear in these streets, yeah (Streets)
And if I hear you them people
You ain't hearin' from me (From me)

[Intro]
(MonstaBeatz)

[Verse 1]
I just bought myself a 9 and my brother a TEC
Got too much on my mind, hit the blunt and reflect
When I was under arrest, my bitch was under duress
I bet she fucked while I was gone, then I doubled the bet
I smoke weed in Amsterdam and I smuggle the rest
I act like I'm shakin' your hand and you'll get punched with the left
And you can get killed for shit you said under your breath
And if you do choose to bark, it ain't nothin' to a vet
Man, fuck these niggas, I ain't stuntin' these niggas
Yo bitch about to swallow a bunch of me's, nigga
I got a white girl fuckin', suckin' me, nigga
While I'm thinkin' 'bout the days that it sucked to be niggas

[Chorus]
Bought myself a 9 and my brother a TEC
Nigga, keep your head up like that gun to ya neck
And my bitch was scared to fly 'til we fucked on a jet
Fucked her in the cockpit, all these buttons to press

[Verse 2]
I just got myself a blonde with the puffiest chest
I just bought myself some time, wrote my Rollie a check
Ridin' in a double R, just regrettin' regret
Getting loaded more than once, no Russian Roulette
I just left King of Diamonds, I just fucked a baguette
I ain't called her since that day, I just wasn't impressed
Bull with a nose ring, startin' a bunch of BS
Hide the gun, knock on your door, dressed like UPS
Man, fuck these niggas, I ain't stuntin' these niggas
I'm a bear coughing up a bunch of honeybees, nigga
Got hoes under me, like a submarine, nigga
Got a bitch with a clit like a butter bean, nigga (Uh)

[Chorus]
Bought myself a 9 and my brother a TEC (Yeah)
Bought my sons toys and my daughter a pet
Bought my homeboys choppers and my woman a dress
And to catch me if I fall, I bought my mother a net, let's go

[Verse 3]
Anyone could get knocked off, any bitch could get knocked up
Baby daddy get locked up, sell everything, put the house up
Don't say anything, keep your mouth shut
Except two words and that's "how much"
If I do get out, we're skippin' town
She said what about her mama
I paused
I said, "I gotta do what I gotta
Is you gon' ride with me or you not?"
And she start cryin' and said, "I'm not"
And I paused
I said, "It's probably what's best
Well, I'll be back when pigs fly
So they can't follow me on my jet"
I tell my pilot where to go next
I bring that problem to your doorstep
I catch you slippin' while you tired
Like the road wet, like it's no sweat
I'm Tunechi, hi, I'm here to collect
They wondering why I ain't gettin' no rest
'Cause that's just too close to arrestin'
And too far from "serve and protect"
So, Police, read me my wrongs, or just leave me alone
Rubbing, squinting my eyes, I still don't see where I'm wrong
Sold my soul to the streets, they bought it previously-owned
Went to jail for a Glock and soon as I got home

[Chorus]
I went and bought myself a 9 and that new MAC-11
You talk shit at 10:59 and make the news at 11
Bitch, I'm the wildest motherfucker on a team full of rebels
Young, wild motherfucker to a MILF, cougar, leopard

[Verse 4]
I'm a lion, motherfucker, to these hoes 'cause you can sweat a little
Euro my secret weapon like Mark, Jackson and Stephen
I see plain-clothes pigs and unmarked intrepids
My bitch believe what I say, I told her salt was pepper
I'm cold as malts and metals, sell stolen parts, whatever
Put three holes in your head like a bowling ball, don't spare 'em
And all my niggas in jail, that's bullshit, I smell ya
Remember Destiny's Child? My favorite one was Farrah, man

[Chorus]
Bought myself a 9 and my brother a TEC
I know you don't want war like you just a cadet
Tell a motherfucker who next, "Motherfucker, you next"
I'm the best rapper alive and they love me to death, bye

[Outro]
Yeah
Fuck these niggas, I ain't stuntin' these niggas

[Intro]
Yeah
Scoob in this bitch with me
But this about you
Ooh

[Chorus]
Girl, you know I love you, and I'm there for you
I got some new shoes and a bag of hair for you
I got some candles lit and some underwear for you
Let's have a little hot girl, name her "Celsius"

[Verse 1]
I know there's gotta be a Heaven, 'cause you fell from one
And you've been nothin' but an angel since I helped you up
Sometimes, I gotta ask myself what kinda spell I'm under
But tonight, she wore that dress I gotta help unbutton

[Refrain]
And she shake it like a dog, hop like a frog
Ride it like a horse, scream and holler 'til she lose her voice
Yeah, she shake it like a dog, hop like a frog
Ride it like a horse, scream and holler 'til she lose her voice, yeah

[Break]
'Til she lose her voice, like
Girl, you know I love you, and I... Let's go

[Chorus]
Girl, you know I love you, and I'm there for you
I got some new shoes and a bag of hair for you
I got some candles lit and some underwear for you
Them edible underwear, I ate a pair for you

[Verse 2]
Ooh, now she on a handstand (Ooh), I'm her number one fan (Ooh)
She the intelligent one, I'm just me with my dumb ass (Oh)
She a slim, fine woman with some twerk with her (Twerk with her)
She ain't got a lot of ass, but I could work with her (Oh now)

[Refrain]
'Cause she shake it like a dog, hop like a frog
Ride it like a horse, scream and holler 'til she lose her voice
Yeah, she shake it like a dog, hop like a frog
Ride it like a horse, so I ain't got a choice
She pop it like a tart, then stab it like a heart
She sad when we depart, she watching her remarks
And she said, "We gon' ride this shit on out, if not, we walk"
I said, "Fuckin' right"

[Chorus]
Ooh, you know I love you, and I'm there for you
I got some new shoes and a bag of hair for you
Just ask my bitch about me, I got her a belt Vuitton
And this dick is A1, pussy well-done

[Post-Chorus]
And she say, "Ooh baby, ooh baby
Ooh baby, that dick drive me crazy"
She say, "Oh lordy, oh lordy
Oh lordy, that dick got me crawling, ayy
Oh lord," 'til she lose her voice, like
She said, "Ignore them hoes, better not"

[Bridge]
She said, "Them hoes, better not fuck with my Tunechi" (Ayy)
"He got a magic stick and know how to use it" (Ayy)
She said, "Them hoes, better not fuck with my Tunechi" (Ayy)
"He got a magic stick and know how to use it" (Ayy)
Uhh, she a slim, fine woman with some twerk with her
She ain't got a lot of ass, but I could work with her
She a slim, fine woman with some shit with her
She ain't got a lot of ass, but she pretty as fuck
And she can shake it like a dog, shake it like a dog
Shake it like a, now take that dog for a walk
And want you to walk it like a, serve it like a, bounce it like a, yeah
Walk it like a, serve it like a, bounce it like a, yeah

[Outro]
Girl, you know I love you and I care for you
Girl, you know I love you, I go hard for you, it's from the heart
Girl, you gotta monkey on that dick, monkey on that dick
Act a donkey on that dick, pony on that shit
Let me see you monkey on that dick, monkey on that dick
Act a donkey on that dick, pony on that shit, ooh, you gotta

[Verse 1]
Uh, we had lunch
We talked about love and shit
She looked me in my eyes
And then said the next dick she'd take
Would be her husband's dick, damn
See, I had the steak, she had the lobster
I say, "I want you on my team," she say, "I don't join rosters"
"Oh, believe that," and then the drinks came
And then the mood changed and then her answer switched
She let her hair down and lit a cancer stick
She saw it turned me off and said she tryna quit
She went to the ladies room and I hopped on my phone
Most likely she doin' the same thing

[Chorus]
Like, "Girl, what you think?
Um, should I do it?"
She say, "Shit, I don't know
You know these niggas, he probably used to it"
Her other friend grabbed the phone and said
"That bitch just hatin', you better fuck that nigga
That bitch just hatin', you better fuck that nigga"
And then she say, "If you do, you better fuck him good
'Cause if another bitch could, she gon' f—"

[Verse 2]
We had dinner
We talked about the future
She said I could have chose any bitch
I would beg to differ, but beggars can't be choosers, yeah, mmm
And see, I had the shrimp, she had the pasta
She said she don't like rappers, we got something in common
I said, "Especially that nigga Wayne"
We both laughed and then the wine came
And then her mind changed
She loosened up her blouse, her smirks turn to smiles
It was a full moon when she turned around
She used my restroom, she say, "You know, girl stuff"
She left the water runnin' and hit her girl up

[Chorus]
Like, "What you think?" (Haha)
"Should I do it?"
She say, "Shit, I don't know
You know these niggas, he probably used to it"
Her other friend grabbed the phone and said
"That bitch just hatin', you better fuck that nigga (Yeah)
That bitch just hatin', you better fuck that nigga" (Yeah, yeah)
And then she say, "If you do, you better fuck him good
'Cause if another bitch could, she gon' f—"

[Verse 3]
We had breakfast, yeah
We fucked all night long and shit
We fell asleep naked, so when we woke up
She wanted that morning dick (I gave it to her too, hmm, yeah)
I had the grits, she had the waffles
She say she drank too much last night and I shoulda stopped her
I say, "Believe that," and then my phone rang
She saw my girl name and then her world changed
She put her clothes on and said, "I'm going home, Wayne"
I said, "Lisa, chill," and that was the wrong name
She hit her girl up and said, "I hate rappers"
And then her girl laughed and said, "Bitch, what happened?"

[Chorus]
She said, "What you think?
Fuck, why did I do it?
Bitch, I bet that nigga knew he was gon' fuck
From 'Hi, how you doin'?"
And then her friend on the phone say
"Girl, I was just trippin', I woulda fucked that nigga
Girl, I was just trippin', I woulda fucked that nigga" (Yeah)
And then she said, "Yes, I did, and I fucked him good
So I hope he tell his girl that I fucked him good"

[Chorus: Mikky Ekko]
A sorry's not easy to change
When the love you know slips away
But all I know is that too much is not enough
And that's why you the one I hold onto
Good poison love
Ahh-ahh-ahh

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Mikky Ekko]
A sorry's not easy to change
When the love you know slips away
But all I know is that too much is not enough

Good poison love

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Mikky Ekko]
A sorry's not easy to change
When the love you know slips away
But all I know is that too much is not enough
And that's why you the one I hold onto
Good poison love
Ahh-ahh-ahh

[Verse 1]
Oh, my holy Lord
Sets my soul on fire
Flames of love and sweet perfume
She's my heart’s desire
She's an angel straight from Hell
Draws me to the deep
In the darkness way below
It's my heart she’ll keep
Yeah

Thunder underground
Watch the castle fall
Sound of wind it takes the sky
And winter takes us all
Mountain high against the sky
Watches as we pray
Laughing loud and smiling proud
This is where we lay

[Chorus]
Lover
Leaver
Taker
Believer

[Verse 2]
Oh, God Hellfire
Witch of Endor raised
Saul would fall to his knees, watch the fire rage
Satan plays his flute for him
The sound it burns his ears
Watches as the peace of man slips and disappears

Lover
Leaver
Taker
Believer, believer

[Verse 1]
Do not lie to us
Don't hide your eyes from us
I will take this offered cup
I will sit upon your floor
Tell your stories, tell of your pain
That's what I came here for
And your children come and go as you weep

[Verse 2]
But what have I if I have not love?
I am a waste
My words are empty vessels if I do nothing in this place
And we can scream into the shadows
And it's good that we can
But walk with me I think we'll find a way
And walk with me I think we'll find a way

[Verse 3]
But I'll meet you at the delta
Where the rivers run into the sea
And I'll meet you at the delta
What's behind, I can clearly see
But that beyond, that's beyond me

[Chorus]
When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
And does your love prefer the other?
And does your love just make you feel good?
Does my love prefer the other?
Does my love just make me feel good?

[Verse 4]
When it's all just dust to dust
And that's how it will be
When it's all just nothingness
That means nothing to me
When it's all just dust to dust
And how it will be
When it's all just nothingness
That means nothing to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Does my love prefer the other?
Does my love just make me feel good?
Does my love prefer the other?
Or does my love just make me feel good?

[Chorus]
When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
Does your love prefer the other?
Does my love just make me feel good?

[Intro: Daft Punk]
Work it, make it, do it, makes us
Harder, better, faster, stronger

[Hook: Kanye West]
N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
‘Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
‘Cause I can't get much wronger
Man, I've been waiting all night now
That's how long I been on ya
Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger
(I need you right now!)
(I need you right now!)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Let's get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, ‘cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
‘Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit

[Spoken: Kanye West]
Aww, nah, nah, we can’t give ‘em all that. We can’t give ‘em everything. Graduation is coming—it’s coming, quite soon. The album is getting pushed up as we speak. As I’m speaking right now, the whole building’s going crazy and pushing the album up. They like, “Kanye’s doing drops, let’s push the album up.” You know? The more drops I do, the earlier the album’s gonna come. So just, the more shit I talk, the sooner y’all’ll get the shit.

[Verse 1]
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It is the grounding of a foot uncompromising
It's not forgoing of the lie
It's not the opening of eyes
It's not the waking, it's the rising

[Verse 2]
It's not the shade, we should be past it
It's the light, and it's the obstacle that casts it
It's the heat that drives the light
It's the fire it ignites
It's not the waking, it's the rising

[Verse 3]
It’s not the talking it’s the doing
It’s the hand that yearns for work, in its renewing
Of the self each time you try
Of purpose and of pride
It’s not the waking, it’s the rising

[Verse 4]
It's not the song, it is the singing
It is the hearing of a human spirit ringing
It is the bringing of the line
It is the baring of the rhyme
It's not the waking, it's the rising

[Chorus:]
And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, oh
Nina cried power
Billie cried power
Mavis cried power

And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, oh
Curtis cried power
Patti cried power
Nina cried power

[Verse 5]
It’s not what’s in front but who’s beside you
It’s all that came before and what it provides you
All those that held the line
Who wouldn’t bow down and resign
It’s not the waking, it’s the rising

[Verse 6]
It's not the wall but what's behind it
The fear of fellow men, his mere assignment
And everything that we're denied
By keeping the divide
It's not the waking, it's the rising

[Chorus]
And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, Oh
Nina cried power
Billie cried power
Joni cried power

And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, Oh
James Brown cried power
Lennon cried power
Nina cried power

[Bridge]
And I could cry power
Power has been cried by those stronger than me
Straight into the face that tells you
To rattle your chains if you love being free
I could cry power (power)
Power is my love when my love reaches to me
A perfect show of love
Any act of hope and love
In its actuality

[Chorus]
I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, Oh
Curtis cried power
(Dylan) Cried power
Marvin cried power

Cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, Oh
Power
Power
Nina cried power

[Intro: Joelle James]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Chris Brown & Joelle James]

[Refrain: Chris Brown]
Who cares about me, girl?
Oh, do you care about me, girl?

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Joelle James]
Girl, I put you first in everything (Everything)
How could your mouth lash out on me? (Oh, out on me, out on me)
Ooh, was this the same girl
Who wouldn't leave without saying I love you?
What did I do? Oh, girl, you never cared about me, girl

[Refrain: Chris Brown]
Who cares about me, girl?
Oh, do you care about me, girl?

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Joelle James]
Oh, ‘cause if you did then you wouldn't leave, oh, no (No, woah)
And if you did, my heart would be beating, oh (Woah)
But it ain't beating, no, no, no, ain't beating (Oh, no)
My heart ain't beating, no no no, ain't beating, woah

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Joelle James]
Was it true, oh why?
In love, and she's my woman, I gave it all to you
She bad, the baddest, no issue
I love my baby, she lifts me up
She's got it all
I love my baby, she lifts me up
She lifts me up, oh-oh, oh
‘Cause if you did

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
‘Cause if you did then you wouldn't leave, oh, no
And if you did, my heart would be beating, oh
But it ain't beating, no, no, no, ain't beating (Oh no)
My heart ain't beating, no no no, ain't beating, woah

[Outro: Chris Brown & Joelle James]
Was it true? Oh, no, no, no
In love, and she's my woman
Mmm

Tied in with niggas, you tied in with bitches
You tied in them lies with these prime time niggas
Selfies with your bestie, and the media got you feeling testy
You know I'm young, and I'm restless
I got to much on my mind for some bullshit
I got a lot to do, and I got a lot to say
I got a lot to prove, and I like myself today
Wide open, in the open
Lights closed in, in the world in
I said too much on my mind (Yeah, yeah)
And this is how I feel all the time

[Chorus: Amine]
Go see the world, tell all the boys
Don't need faith, wanna get us
Tryna hold you down, but you just wanna stop
Stuck on the money, but you just want a boy
You're tied in, but your mind's out
Tied in, but your mind's out
Tied in, but your mind's out
You stuck on the money, but you just want more

Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
She gon’ have a nigga bring sand to the beachside (woo!)
We fly, we buy, we drop the Phan', see why
The sand looks sweet, like honey in the beehive, through it back, Eli (Eli)
’Cause she said she love this D, and I say I love that bod' (I do!)
I think she in love with me 'cause that watch aboard say love o'clock

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Ayy, ayy, I'm drippin' again
The way that I drip this shit should be a sin
Ayy, ayy, divorce all my friends
I'm not a Migo, 'bout to trap out the Benz
Ayy, they told me don't spend
I went got the racks and I did it again
Ayy, I think she a twin
Plus she got red calamari skin
Ayy, you don't got no wins
You should grab something white and just throw it on in
I went to school, got suspended
I told her I want some head, bobby pin
If the lil... don't got class, yeah, we call it truancy
I ain't had no money to spend
I got my first check and went paid off my rent

[Verse 1: Jaden Smith & Young Thug]
I poured a four from the clouds down
And my head floating in bliss (Goddamn)
I'm on the phone with big bro now (Damn)
He told me keep Benz on the race (Goddamn)
Until you see it like this, I promise man you'd never think it exists
Straight out a jet to the crib, I'm quick with the switch
Man we never miss, okay (God)
'Bout to turn up in the club, man, back the fuck up
We ain't takin' no pictures
See all the wings in the front, it's us
We had to triple the digits
See all those sexy mamas blowing kisses, man
We had to grant all they wishes (We grants-)
Casamigos got me spinnin'
But I want some spendin' some out wit' some dealers
Let's go (Goddamn)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I'm rocking Dior Sauvage (Damn)
I'm higher than Scotty, they calling me Pippen (God)
I got some Cartier vision, it costs me six thousand
I'm watchin' these women
Money's the reason I'm sinning
Money's the reason I gotta take Ritalin
You niggas don't care 'bout women
Just shut the fuck up, yeah I'm taking care plenty
I put Chanel on a belt buckle, of when my price is half off
I keep a stick for my cover, got way more girls than Hugh Hefner
Got the same name as the butler
But more money than Ashley and her mother
Got a backwood full of sherbert, I'm 'bout to smoke like a murder

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Ayy, ayy, I'm dripping again
The way that I drip this shit should be a sin
Ayy, ayy, divorce all my friends
I'm not a Migo, 'bout to trap out the Benz
Ayy, they told me don't spend
I went got the racks and I did it again
Ayy, I think she a twin
Plus she got red calamari skin
Ayy, you don't got no wins
You should grab something white and just throw it on in
I went to school, got suspended
I told her I want some head, bobby pin
If the lil... don't got class, yeah, we call it truancy
I ain't had no money to spend
I got my first check and went paid off my rent

[Verse 3: Jaden Smith]
Ooh, hop out the back of the turn up
Avoid all the cameras, I did it on purpose
She tryna act like she perfect
I see all the masks that you leave on the surface
She made me write all my verses in cursive
She need all them purses at Hermès
That's like 25 racks and we always on a roll
Man, we always working, let's go

[Verse 4: Young Thug]
Ay, let me pour up some Act, got some brand new graffiti
It's going down my back
I got Chanel slippers, Gucci pennies, baby, girl you can pick
Rocking Giuseppe Zanotti's a night
I spent half a million designer on kits
I got Chanel slippers, Gucci pennies, baby girl you can pick
I got so high, went off the equator, I feel like Buzz Lightyear
I met a broad, skinny like nails, and I was richer than ice cream
I had to grind without a rail, now all my cars got Nitron
Straight to Dubai, I feel like the mail, I was on a Global Express

[Outro: Young Thug]
I had to grind without a rail, now all my cars got Nitron
Straight to Dubai, I feel like the mail, I was on a Global Express
I'm in London, got my beat from London

[Intro: Young Thug]
Tell them pussy niggas take a look at what they done created
Ooh

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I got real runnin' through my veins
I put VVSs in my chains
Remain the same and change up domain
And most these niggas change up for change

[Post-Chorus: Young Thug]
I’m just sayin' tell them pussy niggas take a look at what created
Tell the hoes take a look at what they done created
Tell the cops they gon' start chaos if they raid it
Commanding war, made somebody bleed

Tell the critics that they talkin' 'bout the fuckin' founder
Tell Scott I'm on the way, I’m gettin’ fuckin' faded
Call your mama, Thugger, tell her that you fuckin’ made it

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Came from the ground to the top, uh
I'm 'bout to rob me some rocks, uh
I'm ’bout to set up a shop, uh
I'm 'bout to buy back the block, uh
I got respect for the 'Wop, uh
First nigga gave me a knot, uh
I put some keys in the pot, uh
She got Versace on her crotch, uh
It's purple, but this is not Watson, uh
I make that bitch squirt, it's a thot, uh
I turn a lil' bitch to a lot, uh
My watch on the floor, need a mop, uh
Rob Jack if he come out the box, uh
I got a tail on, it's a fox, uh
I'm banging that fire, fox, uh
My bitch get wild, uh
Bloody cross on like a pastor
Cooking fish scale with no batter-er-er-er
Chains on me like Jerry Springer beads, ay
I repent for my sins everyday

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I got real runnin' through my veins
I put VVSs in my chains
Remain the same and change up domain
And most these niggas change up for change

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
You keep playin' and you get knocked off
I hate to say it but I'm ready for the pop off
Got lil' mama outta drama, I'm talking topped off
She said she ready, let's get it, I got combos
I'm talkin' jumbo, eat me up like mumbos
Beat it up, got me jumpin' off the top rope
Beat it up, got me slidin' off the sliding board
Leave it stuck, man, lil' shawty ain't cleaned out though
I got my money up and I heard that you want some
Nigga moon walkin', Michael Jackson moves
I got latitude, I got gratitude
And if you look up at the moon, you'll see my attitude

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I got real runnin' through my veins
I put VVSs in my chains
Remain the same and change up domain
And most these niggas change up for change

[Post-Chorus: Young Thug]
I'm just sayin' tell them pussy niggas take a look at what created
Tell the hoes take a look at what they done created
Tell the cops they gon' start chaos if they raid it
Commanding war, made somebody bleed
Now I ain't worry 'bout you gettin' past these fuckin' bouncers
Tell the critics that they talkin' 'bout the fuckin' founder
Tell Scott I'm on the way, I'm gettin' fuckin' faded
Call your mama, Thugger, tell her that you fuckin' made it

[Verse 3: T-Shyne]
Yeah, I got real runnin' through my veins (Through my veins)
I heard they tryna find us out in Vegas (Out in Vegas)
Different frames, I got fifty shades (Fifty shades)
I called my dad and told him that we made it (We made it)
Lately, I've been riding in a Ghost (In a ghost)
So much stress, they thinking that I'm gonna overdose (Dose)
You talk shit, and you get comatose (Comatose)
All this money, we gon' need a vault (Need a vault)
My bitch is bad, so designer, she gon' need it (She need it)
C at the bottom of her feet like she Jesus (Chanel)
Pussy water, so I'm seasick (I'm seasick)
And we done made it out the struggle, best believe it (Best believe it), ayy

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I got real runnin' through my veins
I put VVSs in my chains
Remain the same and change up domain
And most these niggas change up for change

[Intro]
Hey, mama (mama), I'ma tell you why (I'ma tell you why)
I can't go to Horace Mann Junior High

[Verse 1]
Raymond Elementary was all good, 'cause it was in the Eight-Trey neighborhood. Horace Mann Junior High was all bad, so many Rolling 60's it made me mad. The Rolling 60's, the rival gang, swamp water deep doing thay thang, Horace Mann Junior High two blocks from my house, no Glocks. I had to run like a mouse, a lot of Trey's died and went to the pen, claimin' Rolling 60's was a popular trend. Salt and Pepper came out from the polygram camp with a song named "Tramp". The Rolling 60's called the Eight-Trey's Tramps. They bumped Salt an' Pepper with major amps, the Eight-Trey's called the 60's sissies, even since the 60's

[Hook]
I can't go to Horace Mann, I can't go to Horace Mann
I can't go to Horace Mann, You don't understand
I can't go to Horace Mann, I can't go to Horace Mann
I can't go to Horace Mann, You don't understand

[Verse 2]
Horace Mann, 2 blocks from the gansta's ride, but they bustin' Rolling 60's from the west side. My hood is close but the O's (?) are deep. One wrong move and they'll play me cheap. I really didn't bang but then again the Tramp talk was gettin' under my skin. One day before my homeroom class, this dude hit up every person he pass, he got to me, I said "ETG", He said "OK, We'll see". I thought we were going to fight. But he wasn't trippin', he just sat tight. Lunch time came I was grabbin' a bite, I spotted homie tellin' every 60 insight, where I was from and who I was. I can't go to Horace Mann, cuz

[Hook]
I can't go to Horace Mann, I can't go to Horace Mann
I can't go to Horace Mann, You don't understand
I can't go to Horace Mann, I can't go to Horace Mann
I can't go to Horace Mann, You don't understand

[Verse 3]
I went to school the very next day. On alert, 'cause I'm from Eight-Trey. Bust Six-O, I was outside my class, Starched up Khakis hangin' off his ass, he said, "cuz, I heard you was a Tramp", I socked him six times like a boxin' champ. I ran, I left Horace Mann, runnin' fast as I can, please understand, it felt like a track meet down on sixty ninth street, just a little kid tryna keep from gettin' his ass beat. All the rolling 60's saw what I did, the whole school chasin' that Eight-Trey kid, when I got to western they let me go, all the Eight-Treys at the liquor sto'. I crossed the street, they shook my hand, I said "Cuz, I can't go to Horace Mann"

[Hook]
I can't go to Horace Mann, I can't go to Horace Mann
I can't go to Horace Mann, You don't understand
I can't go to Horace Mann, I can't go to Horace Mann
I can't go to Horace Mann, You don't understand

[Verse 4]
Back to school, day number three, everybody know I'm from ETG, so I stay low-key and on my toes watchin' out for the Six-O's. No Rolling 60's the coast was clear, I hit the bathroom and unzipped my gear, it took so long to drain my donkey-kong, I felt something was wrong, see for I could finish relieving myself I looked and I wasn't believing myself, eighty-three Rolling 60's walked on in, now the rat-pat was about to begin. I heard a loud noise, I heard it a lot to tell you the truth I thought I got shot, I was layin' in bed and told my wife, "The North-Ridge earthquake saved my life"

[Hook]
I can't go to Horace Mann, I can't go to Horace Mann
I can't go to Horace Mann, You don't understand
I can't go to Horace Mann, I can't go to Horace Mann
I can't go to Horace Mann, You don't understand

[Outro]
Hey, mama, I'ma tell you why
I can't go to Horace Mann Junior High
You don't understand

[Verse: Aminé]
Miami Vice, nahnah, nahnah, nah
Yeah, Miami Vice
Look
Black man, self-made, I don't need your pity hoe
If you call me nigga I might pull up at your rodeo
Living black excellence, my pockets looking Terrio
Only time I'm seeing bars is when I watch his video
Skrrt on a nigga if he skrrt on me
If her skirt big enough she could skrrt on me
Shorty got more tits than Dexter's sis, DD
Ass too thick I gots to hit, TD
Fuck my shoes you can't even fit in my socks
Niggas who don't like me are the type to eat a Tide Pod
Rap the new rock and roll motherfucker
And if you don't like it better roll motherfucker
Last too long so I fuck her eight to eight
Since when did pop songs have a fucking 808?
I mean we control the culture put the food up on the plate
Nicki posted up that picture 'cause she knew that's what it takes
See the beautiful thing, about being black
Is we can take the negative and we make it crack
I'm a asshole, but my president's a shithole
Snake eyes probably the only way his dice roll
2018, you still homophobic
Why my makeup looking better than your girlfriend?
Momma I'm so sorry, these niggas so obnoxious
Fuck a hater when my red Mercedes polished
If I need some love, you know I'm calling momma
If I need a whip, you know I'm calling Arthur
When I need a vid Mikey know there's no one better
And if I need advice then you know I'm calling never
Uh, rocking Helmut Lang bitch, tell me what you think
Balenciaga Prada Club Banana got a name
The album just went gold, the package like my size
My top five is only Aminé times five
Bitch
Hi Sir
We 

[?]
So listen to me please
You ain't let nobody in my 

[?] fight
Nah, 

[?] hit at me
Fuck, that's on the list
Fuck that list, man

[?] Double MF

Oh shit!
Fucker, come here, get out of here
Yeah, what now?
Fucking knife to a gun fight, nigga?

[Shots]

That's what you get for fucking with double R

[Verse]
I want to love you and treat you right
I want to love you every day and every night
We'll be together with a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter of my single bed
We'll share the same room
For Jah provide the bread

[Chorus]
Is this love, is this love, is this love
Love that I'm feeling?
Is this love, love, love
Love that I'm feeling?
I want to know, want to know, want to know now
I got to know, got to know, got to know now

[Refrain]
I-I-I-I-I-I, I'm willing and able
So I throw my cards on your table
I want to love you
I want to love and treat, love and treat you right
I want to love you every day and every night
We'll be together
With a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter, yeah
Of my single bed
We'll share the same room, yeah
For Jah provide the bread

[Chorus]
Is this love, is this love, is this love
Love that I'm feeling?
Is this love, love, love
Love that I'm feeling?
Oh yes I know, yes I know, yes I know now
Oh yes I know, yes I know, yes I know now

[Refrain]
I-I-I-I-I-I, I'm willing and able
So I throw my cards on your table
I want to love you
I want to love and treat, love and treat you right
I want to, yeah
Here I lay all alone
Tossing turning
Longing for some of your tender love
I'm waiting for the right moment to come
So I can thank you for all the tender love you've given to me
Tender love
Love so tender
Pulling me close to you
Baby, I surrender
Candles they light the dark
Now I see how lovely the feelings are
All the tender love you've given to me
I want you more and more
Can't resist you
Move then I feel your touch
Tender love
Jabbing me straight from the heart
Lonely mirror
Please let me be a part
Of the tender love you've given to me
Tender love
Love so tender
Pulling me close to you
Baby, I surrender

[Intro: Dave Chappelle]
All my life all I wanted to do was be great
If the stakes are everything, you'll tell yourself anything you need to hear to survive
Everything I say is the truth and that's a lie
And that's the motherfucking truth

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hmm, remember all I ever wanted was a gold chain and a ride worth 400 plus
Revenge paid to anybody who dishonor us
I'm sensei to them young niggas under us
Been a made man, look what I done made, man is you kiddin'?
When trap nigga needed a way, who did it?
Every song I gave you had some truth in it
Givin' you the pudding, look at it, the proof in it
Went from servin' junkies in hoopties to new Bentley
These suckas just be jumpin' through hoops and they too friendly
That's why I don't politic they said
They all cool it just that I don't fuck wit' nigga much
They change numbers, ain't no need for us to keep in touch
We wasn't famous, we'd be tryna hit them niggas up
I'm standoffish, I swear I walk in rooms, be listenin' to y'all talkin'
See that you ain't talkin' 'bout shit and I start walkin'
Hey, 'cause I ain't here to waste time
Don't wanna put energy in no lame nigga
I don't want no lame nigga takin' mine
But you wanna ball, I could show you how
You like a broad? I could teach you how to turn her out
Show you how to buy 'em low and sell 'em high
But don't assume that it's all that I know about
A made me, I did biz, that's while I raise kids
I got married and fucked it up, that what fame did
Marriage counselor tell me focus on what the pain did
Too busy focusin', tryna do what Jay and Dame did
I'm on a path; I got a purpose, to reach a destination
And either you helpin' me get to it or you in the way

[Chorus: Sam Hook]
Hope they wasn't lyin' when they said it all comes back around, baby
Stuck up here, tryin' to let you go but it's such a long way down
But if it's still a Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall, well I'm still breathin'
If there's something I can say before you finish leavin'
And if everything still happens for a reason, maybe you come back around just like the seasons
Like the seasons

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I'm so extreme, I've never been a man of moderation
See, subtlety just ain't my cup of tea
Don't want my grass green, I want the lobby decorated
And last thing I need somebody sayin' I'll never make it
Don't give a damn, you can catch me with whoever naked
Still some forms of disrespect, I ain't gon' never take it
Even with my vocabulary, can't explain it
I'm sorry what you thought I was, I just ain't that
Guess that's why you say I ain't shit, big will keep rollin' though
Holdin' up the block, doin' such and such with so and so
Que sera, sera
Cure it with a hundred million party like it's Marti Gras
Got some bad Latino wit' me, they some laddi daddi das
See, you said they be hatin', I say send 'em my regards
Bury it under T and A, I call that R&R
Tryna get some stripes on me, that's how you start a war
I been practicin' my reaction to niggas coming with stupid shit
Fuck out my face, man, the conversation over with
I'm done talkin'
How was that-was that good, for real?

[Chorus: Sam Hook]
Hope they wasn't lyin' when they said it all comes back around, baby
Stuck up here and tryin' to let you go but it's such a long way down
But if it's still a Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall, well I'm still breathin'
If there's something I can say before you finish leavin'
And if everything still happens for a reason, maybe you come back around just like the seasons
Like the seasons

[Outro: Dave Chappelle & T.I.]
I'm not promisin' to be perfect but I'll try my best to be great
This ain't no game, this a mother fuckin' trap
This ain't no game, this a mother fuckin' trap

[Verse 1:]
(Last night)
Our lovers' quarrel
(I was thinking about you)
Hurts more than I can say
(And it was kind of dirty)
All night
(And the way that you looked at me)
Help me here
(It was kind of nasty, aah!)
Help me here
(It was kind of trashy)
’Cause I can't help my mind from going there!

[Pre-Chorus:]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you

[Chorus:]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams
Doing really nasty things
Damn, you were in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams

[Verse 2:]
We could be caught
(I just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought
(’Cause I'm broken)
Let's white
(By the one before)
Glove the bed
(He was kind of nasty)
Help me here
(And I feel so trashy)
'Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads!

[Pre-Chorus:]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you

[Chorus:]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams
Doing really nasty things
Damn, you were in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams

[Bridge:]
We were in the swimming pool
I was naked, boy so were you
When we bumped this song while we made love
Dangerous poetry rhymed with our bodies
Sine in the times to the cry of a 1000 doves

[Spoken Interlude:]
I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple drinks and...
Oh my God!

[Chorus:]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams
Doing really nasty things
Damn, you were in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams

[Verse 1]
Spent 24 hours, I need more hours with you
You spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent the late nights making things right between us

[Refrain]
But now it's all good, babe
Roll that backwood, babe
And play me close

[Chorus]
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
Till sundown when I come through

Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too

And play me close

[Chorus]
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me

[Bridge]
Maybe it's six forty-five
Maybe I'm barely alive
Maybe you've taken my shit for the last time, yeah
Maybe I know that I'm drunk
Maybe I know you're the one
Maybe I'm thinking it's better if you drive

[Chorus]
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
Till sundown when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
(Come on

[Verse 3: Millie Bobby Brown]
Not too long ago, I was dancing for dollars
Know it's really real if I let you meet my mama
You don't want a girl like me, I'm too crazy
But every other girl you meet is fugazi
I'm sure them other girls were nice enough
But you need someone to spice it up
So who you gonna call? Millie, Millie
Come and rev it up like a Harley, Harley
Why is the best fruit always forbidden?
I'm coming to you now doing 20 over the limit
The red light, red light stop, stop
I don't play when it comes to my heart, let's get it though
I don't really want a white horse and a carriage
I'm thinkin' more a white Porsches and carats
I need you right here 'cause every time you call
I play with this kitty like you play wit' your guitar

[Chorus]
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
Till sundown when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]

Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you

[Outro]
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Forever young
I wanna be forever young

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Tellin' me the things you that heard about
Nothin' good comes when you searchin' for the wrong things
Somethin' feels off when I come around
Askin' me questions like, "What do I believe in?"
"You," everyone's a saint 'til the church lets out
That goes for you too
Everything ain't perfect but I do it for...

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Who is you to judge me?
Just 'cause I'm drunk and stumblin' out the club, me, her and her girlfriend
Ain't nobody perfect but the Lord
You always quick to point out all my flaws when I was leaving out yours
Here's a message little girls, little boy
You could be the dirtiest muh'fucker in the world but have morals
Don't nobody give you nothin' 'less you work for it
Ladies get an education, you ain't gotta twerk for it
You know the Lord send you a sign, don't ignore it
And that's whether you study from the Bible or Quran or the Torah
We original, indigenous, god among men
It's two things that's yours, your body and your sin
Gotta claim 'em, just like these so-called conservatives
Fight against the rights of homosexuals then go home and play with lil' kid
Shit, I promised all the shit that I'd ever did
Was to move out and leave the hood and keep me from trappin' not up the river
And my testimony my testament
All the bullshit that I seen happen in life turned me into a pessimist
I'm cynical, yeah, I learned life is all about principle
You so judgmental 'cause you miserable
And my inner peace ain't expendable

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Tellin' me the things you that heard about
Nothin' good comes when you searchin' for the wrong things
Somethin' feels off when I come around
Askin' me questions like, "What do I believe in?"
"You," everyone's a saint 'til the church lets out
That goes for you too
Everything ain't perfect but I do it for...

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I never seen nobody end up in the right place
Worried about the wrong thing
So in tribulation, better do your own thang
See, some of my partners trap and some of 'em gang bang
Some of 'em snort powder, just barely maintain
No fuckin' with the Cali, got degree in Physics
Came home with a diploma, got a job makin' pennies
Homie like me who ain't finished high school, dropped out and went to prison
Still ended up runnin' multi-million dollar businesses
Man, if I tell you shit I knew about
You can tell the difference between me reflectin' and tryna glorify
'Cause most the time this shit be borderline outta line
And you just wanna monetize, only focus on the bottom line
When it deeper than that
We here to analyze life and hope the people connect
We not just out here sellin' reefer, find the cheaper connect
Just waitin' on TIP to spit some shit again a G could respect
For real

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Tellin' me the things you that heard about
Nothin' good comes when you searchin' for the wrong things
Somethin' feels off when I come around
Askin' me questions like, "What do I believe in?"
"You," everyone's a saint 'til the church lets out
That goes for you too
Everything ain't perfect but I do it for...

[Outro: T.I.]
Yeah, you see the shit they missin' today is the G-code
You know, what we did, man, we did out of a lack of options, you know?
But we stuck to a code
You win, you lose, but you abide by the code
You dig what I'm sayin'?

Do what you want, what you want with my body
Write what you want, say what you want about me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want, what you want with my body
What you want with my body

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
You can't have my heart and you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can't stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

[Hook 2: Lady Gaga]

[Verse 2: Christina Aguilera]
My bones hurt from all the shows, mmm
But I don't feel the pain, 'cause I'm a pro
I, I sink in
Then I'm okay
'Cause my body belongs to you when I'm on stage, hey
(Hey, hey, hey)
Do what you want, do what you want
Oh
My voice
My life, hey
Do what you want with me
Woo, oh
What you want with my body (body, body...)

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Christina Aguilera]
You can't have my heart and you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can't stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
What you want with my body
Do what you want
What you want with my body

[Bridge: Lady Gaga & Christina Aguilera]
Sometimes I'm scared, I suppose, if you ever let me go
I would fall apart (apart) if you break my heart (ooh-oh)
So just take my body
And don't stop the party

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Christina Aguilera]
What you want, Lady Gaga
You can't have my heart and you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
What you want, Lady Gaga
You can't stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
What you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with my
What you want with my body, world
What you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with my
What you want with my body
Do what you want
Do what you want (body)
Do what you want
Do what you want
Do what you want
What you want with my body

We The Best music
DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
I don't know if you could take it
Know you wanna see me nakey, nakey, naked
I wanna be your baby, baby, baby
Spinning and it's wet just like it came from Maytag
White girl wasted on that brown liquor
When I get like this I can't be around you
I'm too lit to dim down a notch
'Cause I could name some thangs that I'm gon' do

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts

[Interlude: DJ Khaled]
Let's go!

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
I hope you know I'm for the takin'
You know this cookie is for the baking (ugh)
Kitty, kitty, baby give that thing some rest
'Cause you done beat it like the '68 Jets
Diamonds ain't nothing when I'm rockin' with ya
Diamonds ain't nothing when I'm shinin' with ya
Just keep it white and black as if I'm ya sista
I'm too hip to hop around town out here with ya
I know I get

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts

[Verse 3: Bryson Tiller]
Ayy, I heard that pussy for the taking
I heard it got these other niggas goin' crazy
Yeah I treat you like a lady, lady
Fuck you 'til you're burned out, cremation
Make it cream, yeah, Wu-Tang
Throw that ass back, bouquet
Call me and I can get it juicy
I can tell you're gone off the D'USSÉ
Careful mama watch what you say
You talking to me like ya new bae
Girl, talking like you tryna do things
Now that pipe got her running like she Usain, baby
You made me drown in it, touche, baby
I'm carrying that water, Bobby Boucher, baby
You know I'ma slaughter like I'm Jason
Bust it, why you got it on safety?
White girl wasted on brown liquor
I probably shouldn't be around you
'Cause you get wild, wild, wild
You looking like there's nothing that you won't do
Ayy, girl that's when I told you

[Chorus: Rihanna]
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts

[Intro: T.I.]
Still hustlin' at five in the mornin'
These retro Jordan's ain't never walked a mile
And I'm knowin' no matter what they said, heavy the head
Who said shit would be simple?
To get rich and stay out the trunks of Lincoln Continental
Remember barely gettin' by applyin' fundamentals
In these streets you either eat or become dinner
Ain't shit to win when you already got it all
But go from havin' no options to buyin' mansions, Versace and shit

[Chorus: Watch the Duck]
You don't know the risk if you ain't carried the weight
If you ain't never been down the road that wasn't already paved
Some shit I don't remember, And some I'll never forget
Ain't nobody give me nothin', ain't nobody tell me shit
Big ol' drip

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Overcame the odds, did our thang
That's why can't nobody tell me a bitch ass thang
'Cause there weren't nobody around when it was me and the squad
Trappin' in the shadows, sellin' crack in the dark
Was pushin' poison, I wonder sometimes did it matter to God?
That I didn't have no hot water and my stomach was growlin'
Learned to think outside the box watchin' niggas around me
And bein' stupid, that'll have ya ass in the county
And bein' dumb'll get ya shot, boy
Pay close attention when niggas run in your spot, ready for you to die
That's why you better have your head on a swivel and your antennas up
Fucked around, get killed by a police the way you reachin', bruh
When the odds stacked up against you, if nothin' ventured, nothin' gained
Gotta do more than sit and complain
Every album I made was a product of pain
You really think you ain't gon' change comin' far as I came? Come on

[Chorus: Watch the Duck]
You don't know the risk if you ain't carried the weight
If you ain't never been down the road that wasn't already paved
Some shit I don't remember, and some I'll never forget
Ain't nobody give me nothin', ain't nobody tell me shit
Big ol' drip

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Dangerous lifestyle from jumpin' the turnstile
Refused to pipe down, the shit we would burn down
Distractions everywhere, some shit you just gotta turn down
And ain't no freebies in this shit, you get what you earned now
Yeah, you live and you learn but you reap what you sow
And your intention ain't what you'll be held accountable for
It's your actions, it don't matter what you do for yourself
If every time somebody call on you and you ain't no help
That ain't no king shit
All that stuff you buyin', it don't mean shit
On some boost your self-esteem shit 'cause you ain't seen shit
Callin' me an activist, stumbled on it by accident
You can say I'm passionate but not a politician though
On IG I'm killin' that fashion shit, I be drippin' with
Raf Simons trench coat, cashmere turtleneck
Hideoki three piece pinstripe with the collar bar
Rose gold cuff link, same as the Audemar

[Break: T.I.]
Hey, back against the wall, would you risk it all?
I figure if I could get me some, I could get it all
Started with a bankroll small as a tennis ball
Now in my city I'm big as Pac and Biggie Smalls
God with me, whom shall I fear
There no more beggin' folk for shit we oughta get ourselves, and
Just so I'm clear, what it took to get here, you got no idea
For real

[Chorus: Watch the Duck]
You don't know the risk if you ain't carried the weight
If you ain't never been down the road that wasn't already paved
Some shit I don't remember, and some I'll never forget
Ain't nobody give me nothin', ain't nobody tell me shit
Big ol' drip

[Intro: Victoria Monét]
I loved you
When there was nothing
And now look what you've done
To me

[Chorus: Victoria Monét & T.I.]
It's amazing how
Yeah, yeah
You hurt me so
Goddamn, yeah
How could you do this again?
You must work really hard to fuck up this much, uh
That shit is amazing, I swear (I say, ayy)
It's amazing how
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You hurt me so
Goddamn, man, you fucked up again?
Over and over again
Sheesh, how the fuck you keep up with this shit
(Damn) You never cease to amaze me, man

[Verse 1: T.I.]
It's a, amazing all the shit I done
Such examples I've been setting for my son
All she did was stay down and have my kid
All the time just to realize I ain't shit
Such audacity that I must have
To get in men company and slap on ass
Damn, if I must say in my defense
I think should get credit for the asses I resi-
What? Goddamn, now she get upset
Huh, hang up in my face and block my number and shit
Thinkin', 'you fucked that up again, man, why don't you just apologize?'
For all the time you done got caught out in all the lies
For all the time that shawty put in on this long ride
I'm 'posed to show her compassion, I show a lot of pride'
Then when she looked at me, told me, "You runnin' out of time"
But this gon' feel different on the other side, it's gon' be amazing

[Chorus: Victoria Monét & T.I.]
It's amazing how
You hurt me so
Yeah
How could you do this again?
I swear, man, uh
Just when I think you can't fuck up no more (I say, ayy)
It's amazing how
Here this nigga go again, yeah
You hurt me so
I can set my watch off for you
Over and over again
Fuck is wrong with you, dude?
(Ayy) You ain't shit, you know that, my nigga?

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I—I say
It's a, amazing how far I've come
Homicide, fed time, auto-gun
I used to take girls gettin' work on the run
Cut to the day and, man, I get in trouble flirtin' with one
Goddamn, like the one we love, hurt her the most
Broken promises and broke your heart, fill up the boat
Make it too heavy when the water deadly
Holler at your capture, tried to tell you but you're hardheaded
They all meddlin' in your business, 'cause they all messy
And I don't let them bitches stress me that be y'all headache
Got all my life to make you happy, this a small delay
Don't sweat the small shit
Said I'd be dead in my twenties, I bet they all pissed
Drippin', spendin' eighty in Venice, same at the dentist
Hopin' the gifts'll change your perception of me
Look how I went from kissin' and lovin' her
To bein' just a nigga that she suffer for, damn, that's amazing

[Chorus: Victoria Monét & T.I.]
It's amazing how
Man
You hurt me so
You really fucked that up, bro
How could you do this again?
Nobody could'a did that like you, man, congratulations, man
Never cease to amaze me, man, it's just amazing
It's amazing how
I tell you, for a brilliant motherfucker you plum dumb sometimes
You hurt me so
Look at what Mr Fuck Up has fucked up again
Over and over again
Round of applause for Mr Fuck Up, please. Everybody stand up

[Post-Chorus: Victoria Monét & T.I.]
How could you, how could you hurt
Yeah
How could you, how could you hurt me
Just when we think
No one can fuck up as much as they fucked up before, he is, he set the new standard
He's raising the bar, this shit's a—fucking—mazing people
How could you, how could you hurt
Pay homage where homage is due
How could you, how could you hurt me
You can learn a lot from anybody, man
Even a motherfucker who show you exactly what not to do, you know?
Anybody in life, man, you know what I'm saying?
How could you, how could you hurt
Fuck a role model, get a real model, man
Somebody who gon' be real with you all the time
How could you, how could you hurt me, oh baby
Good or bad, you know?
A role model just playing a role, you know?

[Outro (Sampled): Lauren London & T.I.]
LONDON: Give me back my necklace!
T.I.: No
LONDON: Give me my damn necklace back!
T.I.: Why should I?
LONDON: 'Cause it's mine... and it means something to me
T.I.: Man, watch out

[Intro: Anderson Paak]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohhh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Anderson Paak]
You walking off like that's it now
Talking all of that shit now
All that noise I can't hear now
It can't get much worse than this now
Baby, how hard you gon' get now?
How long are you gon' stick around?
When the money get low
It's like I never see your pretty smile
But at least I know (Ah, yeah)
At least these things I know (Yeah)
At least these things I know (Yeah)
At least these things I know (Yeah)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ay, man, one thing I know 'bout me is me (I know it)
I'm already knowin' and you might think that I'm already going
Looking at your phone, you see me call, you ignore it
Make me wanna call another whore up
My pimp kicking in, too high for this shit
Aye, man, them games you be playing, too fly for this shit
I die for this shit
And you don't really know that's what you got, do you?
And you don't really see the mirror once you got, do you?
See, you should never take advice from a person when they ain't gon' be affected by the outcome
And when you're looking at the life of a person
When you get a 100 million when you like such a person
If it was Sodom and Gomorrah would you look back?
If it was just me, you, the kids and the book bag
Especially if I told ya ass not to look back
Tomorrow brighter than the past, hate to see you turn to ash
Shawty, I don't play nothin', you've been A1, you my day one
You can't say shit, attention pay none to their opinion 'cause they be on
All that fake shit, I go take shit to the extreme
Fuss and fought 'bout, shit I thought 'bout
You and whoever it ain't shit to talk 'bout (Bitch)
Call you a bitch, then you just walk out

[Chorus: Anderson Paak & T.I.]
You walking off like that's it now
Talking all of that shit now
All that noise I can't hear now
It can't get much worse than this now
Baby, how hard are you gon' get now?
How long are you gon' stick around?
When the money get low
It's like I never see your pretty smile
But at least I know (Ah, yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I don't deserve you, lucky to have you
I hate to see you just walk away
Well, I know that it ain't gon' be
Cool with the game, you playing on me
So no more back and forth about this and that
No more tit for tat, what bitch is that? What nigga called?
You let a nosey broad get all in your head, well, fuck both of y'all
Ah, it's solid as it get now
And said if I were where you at
Well, tell me why every time I turn around
It look like you packing your shit and you're going on
But, shawty, going on, call her and she ain't got her phone on
Enjoy, hope you love that nigga
A sucker? Sorry, I never was that nigga
Now I'ma have to tag me a hoe or two
Pour up a pint to get my mind off the thought of you
Man, I'm just playin', you my mind, all I want you
And slow down, lil' mama, where you walking to?

[Chorus: Anderson Paak & T.I.]
You walking off like that's it now
Talking all of that shit now
All that noise I can't hear now
It can't get much worse than this now
Baby, how hard are you gon' get now?
How long are you gon' stick around?
When the money get low
It's like I never see your pretty smile
But at least I know (Ah, yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me

[Verse 3: Anderson Paak]
Promise when I make my first mill', we can still take a train to the steakhouse
And promise when I get you this Chanel, you'll pawn that shit if I don't make bail
I know that I ain't that only one that believes
That when the money longer than a Grey Hound
Every body wanna see
But when it's time to gas that bitch, you niggas can't pay now
A hundred G's would get you thirty even
You always eatin' take-out
Told your ass to get a couple drinks, ohh, you order champagne now
Grand Marnier, now
Oh, you shopping everyday, now
Closet looking like a Louis V playground
Walking out the front door in the goddamn shoes I pay for
Damn, and I'm the one to blame now
Banana peel the whole bank account
I'm living with a ape now
She only want the cake now
Selfies, all you take, now
I'm selfish if I break now
I'm begging you to stay around 'cause you're

[Chorus: Anderson Paak & T.I.]
You walking off like that's it now
Talking all of that shit now
All that noise I can't hear now
It can't get much worse than this now
Baby, how hard are you gon' get, now?
How long are you gon' stick around?
When the money get low
It's like I never see your pretty smile
But at least I know (Ah, yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me

[Outro: Dave Chappelle]
Nothing feels better than fighting and winning

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Yeah, from the cracks and the holes in the pavement
Ain't no hope for the youth, Lord, save me
Gotta smile through it even though you hate it
All I ask is that you pray for me

[Verse 1: YFN Lucci]
You know we always payin' attention
Always out handlin' business
Niggas in they feelings
Certain shit can't be given
I'ma go and get it, yeah
Niggas got they hand out, shit, that ain't the way we livin', yeah
That ain't the way that I pictured thirty hoes and ten of us niggas
See, that's the way we kick it
Twenty of us, and ten of us probably got an extension
Everybody playin' broke 'cause they think I can fix it
Everything that you got, that shit probably rented
I know my partners wit' me
Ain't no stoppin' this shit, the sky is the limit, yeah

[Break: YFN Lucci]
Who gon' ride wit' me?
Ayy, who gon' ride wit' me?
Yeah, death before dishonor but you lied to me, dang

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Made it to the top from the gutter
Promisin' the hood I came from it'll never be another, yeah
Remember trappin' in the hood, duckin' under cover
Buyin' hard ounces for my msms brother
Tryna block mine, boy, you get knocked out, hah
I'm wit' the shit you know that you are not 'bout
Old nigga with some long money
Nigga try me, I'ma get it all from ya
Listen, I ain't worried 'bout the small, run it
Got my chrome on his dome then it dawned on him, dead 'em
Plans too large, huh, nigga get on your ass, you put laws on 'em
Fuck that shit, I'ma still sic my dogs on 'em
Don't care how many police you call on 'em
Ridin' wit' my niggas 'til the wheel fall, if you got the dice, put it all on
Live by the sword or die by it but sometimes you gotta fall on it
Hey, ain't it funny how the dumbest niggas know it all, don't it?
Nigga, keep it silent, you ain't lived through it, don't talk 'bout it, yeah
Sixteen totin' A-K, havin' turf war
I got a record deal, started sellin' dope for my first born, I swear
Look at God, won't He do it?
Gotta run a bag up to somewhere good 'til the bullshit I did null and void
Skully pulled up, forty in my hoodie, hah, and you better not make me pull it
One thing about a sucka nigga, he gon' talk cash shit 'til he run into me
Drop a bankroll on his main bitch, make her go and do it for me
No Hollywood, couldn't fake my life
Quarter million cash on a brand new jet
Crowd me, nah, nobody can do that
Slide a bag, sip on yac, and let 'em handle that
Trap nigga whippin' work in the bando
You violate, retaliation got me mando
I keep a pistol on me 'cause the bands I done ran up
Numbers scratched out, paper runner
Strategy used to be take Atlanta
Spread it then makin' it in Savannah
Runnin' my play up the East Coast
I done tested the caliber, YFN Lucci
Kickin' shit in the Caribbean
Know you pussy, can't even open eye when you shoot
When you live wit' that bullshit, you die wit' it too
I would talk but could not be alive wit' the truth
When you owe me and then gettin' fly wit' it too
Bringin' some action, survive wit' it too
Swear, I'm smokin' on nothin' but power
I get money and dodgin' them cowards

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Yeah, from the cracks and the holes in the pavement
Ain't no hope for the youth, Lord, save me
Gotta smile through it even though you hate it
All I ask is that you pray for me

[Break: YFN Lucci]
Who gon' ride wit' me?
Aye, who gon' ride wit' me?
Yeah, death before dishonor but you lied to me, dang
Who gon' ride wit' me?
Aye, who gon' ride wit' me?
Yeah, death before dishonor but you lied to me, dang

[Outro: Dave Chappelle]
This next beat is so god damn sinister that I don't even, ahhm
It makes me feel like everything
It's just that nitty, gritty, fuckin' dirty South shit
It makes me feel good
This right here, this one's for the pull-up

[Chorus: London Jae]
When the sun goes down and ain't nobody around, I'ma be there
And when you tryna find forever and you lookin' in the clouds, I'ma be there
And when they say that all hope is gone and all lost is lost, yeah
And when you look up in the stars, hopin' I can fly where you are, I'ma be there
And when the sun goes down and ain't nobody around, I'ma be there
And when you tryna find forever and you look up in the clouds, I'ma be there
And when it's all said and done and ain't no one else to call, no
And when you look around it was you that did it all

[Verse 1: T.I.]
If it all fall down, when the smoke clear look around
Betcha see me standin' on a pile
If it all go to hell, I'ma fire a blunt up in the air
Save some for my partners if they there
I declare, I ain't a shoe-in to get in Heaven
But I can make it if God in a good mood, bein' fair
Allow me to prepare, 'cause I know that death comin'
Niggas makin' excuses, they be runnin' from truth
It make they stomach hurt
Further more, a nigga don't want a revolution
These niggas wanna ride a vert, nigga wanna spit a verse
And then write about things they didn't do
See I ain't never did that shit to you
Been a hundred from the start, look
We did some monumental, legendary shit, man, I'm glad I was a part of it
So even if we part ways, we'll always have the good days
And they gon' always be there, yeah

[Chorus: London Jae]
When the sun goes down and ain't nobody around, I'ma be there
And when you tryna find forever and you lookin' in the clouds, I'ma be there
And when they say that all hope is gone and all lost is lost, yeah
And when you look up in the stars, hopin' I can fly where you are, I'ma be there
And when the sun goes down and ain't nobody around, I'ma be there
And when you tryna find forever and you look up in the clouds, I'ma be there
And when it's all said and done and ain't no one else to call, no
And when you look around it was you that did it all

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Hey, when your back against the wall, you think all lost
I'm in your mind helpin' you examine all thoughts
Fuck what them niggas talk about, just talkin'
That's just their way of sayin' that they don't see me that often
I be here for ya, when them niggas get too weird for ya
That shit they make don't feel real to ya
See me every year they like, "Damn, he been around for a long time"
"But it better when he here, we know he definitely real"
And that should be the deal breaker
I oughta call these niggas soft, shakin'
They be droppin' salt on a player like they killin' a snail
Few years ago they better get me, that shit still in the air
Bitch, I'ma be here, huh
I drop shit when I feel like it
Long as I know that I kept it real with all my real niggas and they still with me, I'm cool
Until you get what you supposed to, I'ma keep the champagne cold for the toast
I'ma be here

[Chorus: London Jae]
When the sun goes down and ain't nobody around, I'ma be there
And when you tryna find forever and you lookin' in the clouds, I'ma be there
And when they say that all hope is gone and all lost is lost, yeah
And when you look up in the stars, hopin' I can fly where you are, I'ma be there
And when the sun goes down and ain't nobody around, I'ma be there
And when you tryna find forever and you look up in the clouds, I'ma be there
And when it's all said and done and ain't no one else to call, no
And when you look around it was you that did it all

When the sun goes down and ain't nobody around, I'ma be there
And when you tryna find forever and you lookin' in the clouds, I'ma be there
And when they say that all hope is gone and all lost is lost, yeah
And when you look up in the stars, hopin' I can fly where you are, I'ma be there
And when the sun goes down and ain't nobody around, I'ma be there
And when you tryna find forever and you look up in the clouds, I'ma be there
And when it's all said and done and ain't no one else to call, no
And when you look around it was you that did it all

[Outro: T.I.]
You know what they say
What the devil mean for bad, God use it for good, right?
Well, I'm sure the people who put crack cocaine in our communities infested us with all this hate, all these guns, all this violence, all this rage
You see they never counted on us takin' those very experiences, packaging them as philosophical presentations set to music about the experiences
And how many people would relate to it and how much commerce would come from it
Yeah, they didn't count on that
Heh, that they dumb ass
It's trap music

[Intro]
Hey, check me
I ain't-I ain’t gon' go back and forth
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Went insane in the Nineties and then I bounced back
Could of this year, lookin' like I lost my mind again
Now, did I find it (No?)
Life is all about timin’ (It is)
Gotta know the devil's in the details
That why when you doin' deals, I would wanna read the fine print
I'm the king, nigga, no denyin' that (Uh uh)
But nevermind that, just a solid nigga tryna find solutions to the generation problem
Make a couple hundred million dollars in the process (What wrong wit' dat?)
And my mind set, it fluctuate from gettin' a bunch of paper to the revolution to a six shooter
Fuck the President and fuck politics (Fuck 'em, yeah)
I’m just a family man, former dope boy
So you know I ain’t goin' for no bullshit, no
They stay cappin’ I make happen, shit
Muh'fucka think can't happen
They shit talkin', I’m face slappin'
No convo, I'm talkin' straight action like the old days
Met the forty cal, spin 'em 'round like the O-Jays
Hit 'em four time with the four-four bumpin' Jay shit, yeah
Never tolerated disrespect, I ain't the one to play with (Nah)
Way a minute, now
Cross that line; he wouldn't dare
In shark water, way deep out there, yeah

[Chorus]
I ain't never lived in the moment
Busy tryna find another way to feel that rush
Man, fuck the celebration, concentrate on gettin' bigger
I'm tryna find a way to feed all these niggas
Can you carry that load?
Wanna live that life?
The shit you doin', homie, I done all that twice
That's a light day
The shit you doin', homie, I done all that twice
That's a light day

[Verse 2]
Okay
Death before dishonor amongst us thieves is honor, okay
With y'all it's me and mine, with us it's we and ours
Okay, okay, with us we hit a lick and bust it up
You hear the lick, kill your homie, and keep from splittin' it
See, treachery will never be cool
Whatever we do, we straight up
Tuck no tail, take no shit
Consider your decisions, the consequences and benefit
'Fore you just go out, gettin' into shit
Gone be some real when the sentence hit
Then a cold penitentiary, said you gon' be gone a quarter century
Say, when they mention your name, nigga go to forgettin' shit
Your co-defendant singin', was on some Boyz 2 Men shit
Fundamentals, move work and rental
Hustlin', business to attend to
Broke shit, I wasn't into, couldn't do it
Operation by any means make it outta the hood
Love to see my momma doin' good, uh
Love to see my niggas stackin' money, gettin' to it, shit
But when the light don't shine and the ice don't glow 'cause your window closed, you know

[Chorus]
I ain't never lived in the moment
Busy tryna find another way to feel that rush
Man, fuck the celebration, concentrate on gettin' bigger
I'm tryna find a way to feed all these niggas
Can you carry that load?
Wanna live that life?
The shit you doin', homie, I done all that twice
That's a light day
The shit you doin', homie, I done all that twice
That's a light day

[Outro]
That's a light day, oooooh
That's a light day
That's a light day
Oooooooh, that's a light day

[Intro: Dave Chappelle]
Who the fuck is that?
Yeah, bitch, it's me, it's me
So humble, I'm so humble

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ay, tell me what you gon' see looking back at yo' life
Won't be worth a damn, if you ain't living it right
All we know is stripes, learned to die for respect
You make a lot of money, they admirin' that
We gettin' bags here, playa, it just is what is is
Fall, fly, do or die, kill or be killed
Remember, walking Bankhead was a terrible thought
Intensions ain't work, tryna come up now
I'm prayin' God blessed me and this life I chose
'Cause the new Benz dropped, can't be ridin' the old ones
In 12 hours, I done raised hell and shit
Middle of the crack era, tryna sell and shit
In Vegas, fightin' police, me and Jeezy and 'em
Hit the strip, Fat Burger, did my thing again
All I do is kick back, blow gas and smile
Reminiscin' 'bout when I was young and wild
You're still feeling the effects of the shit we did
Before us, drug dealers didn't get this big
Where I'm from, it ain't glamorous, quite the different outcome
You have a run, get indicted, then forget about him
So much greatness but not so many make it, wonder how come?
It's been that way since Huey Newton, Martin, Malcolm
I got a grind and a hustle I inherited
Plus a 1 of 1 drip that my daddy had

[Chorus: T.I.]
Ay, tell me what you gon' see when you looking back at yo' life
Ay, tell me what you gon' see when you looking back at yo' life
Looking back at yo' life
Ay, tell me what you gon' see when you looking back at yo' life
Looking back at yo' life
Ay, tell me what you gon' see when you looking back at yo' life
Looking back at yo' life

[Verse 2: T.I.]
On the front line facin' off with the L.A.P.D
Only nigga ain't a gang member is me
I'm certified through and through, ain't nothin' flawed 'bout that
The nigga was talkin' shit in Houston, went and saw 'bout that
In Cincy, caught me slippin', lost my homeboy 'bout that
Some bystander died after but never quite got back
I heard they caught 'em, I'm thinkin', 'We could pay the bond, I bet'
And then wait, 'Am I a maniac for thinkin' of that?'
Listen, my freedom on the line, I'ma square up and cap
But nigga lyin', talkin' 'bout I told, he really chillin' with a rat though
We through Paperwork party, show mine on a yard
In gen pop, coached ball, taught a class and all
With the only one from Georgia gettin' regular visits
Filled up a couple busses so my people could kick it
Really did that, how the fuck you live with yourself?
Knowin' the only thing you ever did, you did it for self

[Chorus: T.I.]
Ay, tell me what you gon' see when you looking back at yo' life
Ay, tell me what you gon' see when you looking back at yo' life
Looking back at yo' life
Ay, tell me what you gon' see when you looking back at yo' life
Looking back at yo' life
Ay, tell me what you gon' see when you looking back at yo' life
Looking back at yo' life

[Outro: Dave Chappelle]
Everything I say, is the truth. And that's a lie. And that's the motha fuckin' truth

[Verse 1]
I needed someone to depend upon
I was alone, I was emotional
Searching for the right emoticon
To expand my mental lexicon

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Then Gemma told me that she met someone
It was the person I'd been counting on
It felt good, it felt transitional
A feeling I'd been waiting on

[Chorus]
You were floating like a lilo
With your eyes closed, going where the tide goes
Caught in flux, you drifted 'til you hit the sides
Hold my breath another minute
I can keep my head, there's nothing in it
I'm a patient wave
And it's an easy ride

[Verse 2]
I saw myself an intellectual
I thought that I was capable
Every move was just habitual
And life was just a ritual

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Then Gemma told me that she met somebody
Nobody else could take me from myself
I wasn't searching for it anymore
The feeling I'd been waiting for

[Chorus]
You were floating like a lilo
With your eyes closed, going where the tide goes
Caught in flux, you drifted 'til you hit the sides
Hold my breath another minute
I can keep my head, there's nothing in it
I'm a patient wave (I'm a patient wave)
And it's an easy ride

[Bridge]
Floating like a lilo with you
Going where the tide goes
Floating like a lilo with you
Going where the tide goes
Floating like a–
Floating like a–
Floating like a–
Floating like a–

[Chorus]
You were floating like a lilo
With your eyes closed, going where the tide goes
Caught in flux, you drifted 'til you hit the sides
Hold my breath another minute
I can keep my head, there's nothing in it
I'm a patient wave (I'm a patient wave)
And it's an easy ride

[Verse 1]
Li'l Abner
Don't marry that gal
Even though she's nice as she can be
When you don't say nothing never
Will she make believe you're clever
Like for instance, me

[Verse 2]
Li'l Abner
Don't marry that gal
Even though you has that license fee
Would she put up with your yawning
And not hate you in the morning
Like for instance, me

[Verse 3]
Why take a chance on a new love
'Specially a gal you don't know
Come back to me and your true love
And the folks who miss you so

[Verse 4]
Li'l Abner
Don't marry that gal
Don't make my love for you a mockery
Though it sounds like foolish hokum
There's just one girl that rates a yokum
And that gal is me

[Intro: Ant Clemons]
We need peace, love and harmony
Must achieve all that we could be
Just love on me 'cause that's just what I need
Your love on me is all I ever need, need

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Part of my flesh be blendin' in with my soul
Do what I feel and I live what I say so
Oh, been travelin' a million miles on this road
I wasn't leavin', I was on my way home
Oh, I wasn't leavin', I was on my way home
I wasn't leavin', I was on my way home
Oh, I wasn't leavin', I was on my way home
I wasn't leavin', I was on my way home

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
They be sellin' somethin' when it's not shame
West stole West, simply got shame
Givin' up, I'm givin' up my slave name
Oh, no, no, I'm givin' up my slave name
Saint, you don't really need a last name
North, you don't really need a last name
Bump on the song for the dark chains
I'm givin' up the slave name
It's a choice for me
Y'all can't cut out the voice in me
Y'all can't do nothing, get mad at me
Y'all came for my anatomy
Y'all can't cut out the Harriet
I don't care how you carry it
Stomp, stomp, that'd be very lit
God stomp, wanna be alien
Saint, you don't really need a last name
North, you don't really need a last name
And Chicago, yo, they lost, but we not bought
Oh, then he tells 'em

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Part of my flesh be blendin' in with my soul
Do what I feel and I live what I say so
Oh, been travelin' a million miles on this road
I wasn't leavin', I was on my way home
Oh, I wasn't leavin', I was on my way home
I wasn't leavin', I was on my way home
Oh, I wasn't leavin', I was on my way home
I wasn't leavin', I was on my way home

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Ant Clemons]
It's like they take our slave women
And bend them quicker than when we hit it
Where you think lightskin came from? (Huh?)
I heard the Chinese buyin' Africa quicker than we would get it
And if you tell somebody you goin' to Africa
Somebody would laugh at ya
Like the top off it, and spend it at the Gucci store
Hold on more, woah, woah
Don't tell me 'bout them woke facts (Woke fact)
Them just sound like broke facts (Broke facts)
I don't know who the fuck told you that (Told you that)
I don't know who the fuck sold you back (Told you that)
Buy your freedom 'fore they sell you back (Sell you back)
Why we need 'em? They just sold you crack (Sold you crack)
So let's done 'em, where the soldiers at? (Soldiers at)
Most of them ain't running, most of them want that bump (Ooh)
Face the gun in the sun, we been brainwashed (Ooh)
Fuck that, we in our own holocaust (Ooh)
It ain't never ended, it all depends (Ooh)
The Jews, least they said, never again

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Part of my flesh be blendin' in with my soul
Do what I feel and I live what I say so
Oh, been travelin' a million miles on this road
I wasn't leavin', I was on my way home
Oh, I wasn't leavin', I was on my way home
I wasn't leavin', I was on my way home
Oh, I wasn't leavin', I was on my way home
I wasn't leavin', I was on my way home

[Outro: Kanye West]
Saint, you don't really need a last name
North, you don't really need a last name
And Chicago, yo, and Chicago

[Intro]
I wake up and count my
I wake up and count my

[Chorus]
I wake up and count my blessings, never stressing
I wake up, I pray that God lead me in the right direction
Yeah, wake up and count my blessings, never stressing
I wake up, I pray to God hoping that he get my message, yeah
I've been on the low, low, low
I do not know, know, know
Just what I want, want, want
So got me Lord, Lord, Lord
I’ve been on the low, low, low
I do not know, know, know
Just what I want, want, want
So got me Lord, Lord, Lord

[Verse 1]
No one ever saw the vision (They didn't)
Told me I was too young, too calm in this game
But I envisioned something different
Yeah they turned me down, told me I was trippin'
Now we planning trips and plotting on the mission
And because of my age, man, there’s been division (Oh yeah)
They say pave the way, man, that's my decision
Never been forced, honestly its sickenin'
Now they making claims (They making claims)
Man that's so insane (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Talking about, "I changed" (What)
But I've been this way
They said, "Your dream's too big"
Now take a look at what I did
I'm 'bout to take over the game
No questions, boy, that’s it
I swear to God

[Chorus]
I wake up and count my blessings, never stressing
Every night, I pray to God, lead me in the right direction
Yeah, wake up and count my blessings, never stressing
I wake up, I pray to God hoping that he get my message, yeah
I been on the low, low, low
I do not know, know, know
Just what I want, want, want
So got me Lord, Lord, Lord
I been on the low, low, low
I do not know, know, know
Just what I want, want, want
So got me Lord, Lord, Lord

[Verse 2]
I know they hatin’ (I know, I know)
I pay them no attention (No, no, no no)
They trying to imitate me
But I should probably mention
There's only one little kid
Couldn’t care less about what you did
Or what you doing honestly
Too concentrated on my biz
I don't got time for their games
Don't pay no mind to these lames
I'm in my own separate lane
I mean, I’m just sayin'
I'm gonna put in honest work
I've seen how far I can get
See all the hate, it don't work
We got the platinum on set, yeah

[Chorus]
I wake up and count my blessings, never stressing
Every night, I pray to God lead me in the right direction
Yeah, wake up and count my blessings, never stressing
I wake up, I pray to God hoping that he get my message, yeah
I been on the low, low, low
I do not know, know, know
Just what I want, want, want
So got me Lord, Lord, Lord
I been on the low, low, low
I do not know, know, know
Just what I want, want, want
So got me Lord, Lord, Lord

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah
C5

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Don't cry, don’t go
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Why y’all staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin' down?
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No, a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one, it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I’m hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads: "Don’t cry, stay tuned."
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin’ afterlife
Rest in paradise

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry), don’t go (Why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry, don't cry)
I fuckin' love you, woah (Don't cry, don't cry)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like, "dun-dun-dun-dun-dun"
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, "It's just you and I"
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry), I fuckin' love you, woah
(Triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife, rest in paradise)
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah (Don't cry)

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Don't cry, stay tuned
And triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife
Rest in paradise

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I used to smoke to get high, now I smoke to get vibes
I used to tote the semi, I still tote the semi
I used to walk a thin line, now I'm walking chin high
I used to fuck and get tired, now I fuck her ten times
She used to make me dick rise, now she make me ribeyes
She used to make me six-nine, now she make her friend try
She used to make me love her, now she make me realize
It's money over bitches 'till the day I dizz-ie
Keep it on the East Side, keep it on the B-side
I feel like Ivan Drago, if he dies, he dies

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Find out where he reside and find out where he hide
Run up in that bitch like, "Hey," pop-pop-pop, peace sign
Percocet, promethazine, you can call me P-Rod
Taking shots at my team, you must be getting senile
You goin' at my slime then you're going at me, slime
Your blood all over the scene, it look like red cheap wine
I'm smoking on a key lime, you look like tea time
Look like honey to my beehive, I close your sweet eyes
Shoot ya in ya head, give ya ass three eyes
And you still ain't seen a fucking thing until you C5
I remember you, I was never into you
I tell my shooters, shoot you and whoever resemble you
And every member who had been a friend of you or kin to you
They in it too, and bitches too, they mention you, they dentures loose
Run up in a nigga house, pistol in that nigga mouth
Safe code now nigga, cough it up or spit it out
Oh my God I'm flipping out, flipping out then dipping out
I tried to turn the fuckin' page, oh my God, I ripped it out

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I used to smoke to get high, now I smoke to get vibes
I used to tote the semi, I still tote the semi
Keep it on the East Side, keep it on the B-side
I feel like Ivan Drago, lil bitch, and if he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
Yeah, run up in that nigga house, pistol in that nigga mouth
But he be talking out his ass, what is all that shit about?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I used to know you niggas, I don't know you niggas
I just ignore you niggas, I don't bro you niggas
With my bros will smoke you niggas, like we grow you niggas
Kill your ho too nigga, and your go-to niggas
I've been riding 'round the city with the safety off
Glock nine and it's pretty like a baby doll
You niggas bitches and it's pissing all the ladies off
My finger sitting on the trigger like a La-Z-Boy
If there was beef, I'm in the kitchen with the apron on
Put his words on the plate, that nigga ate 'em all
And I ain't wit' the talking, but damn now he talking
Nigga spilled the beans, damn, now it's coffee
Looking for your pussy ass like I got a warrant
I throw on the ski mask, that's a private party
Bullets jumping off your ass like they shock absorbant
Rock your bells, LL, nigga locked and loaded

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I used to smoke to get high now I smoke to get vibes
I used to tote the semi, I still tote the semi
Keep it on the East Side, keep it on the beast side
I feel like Ivan Drago lil bitch, and if he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
Yeah run up in that nigga house, pistol in that nigga mouth
But he be talking out his ass, what is all that shit about?
I used to smoke to get high, now I smoke to get vibes
Used to tote the semi, I still tote the semi
Keep it on the East Side, keep it on the B-side
I feel like Ivan Drago lil bitch, and if he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
Yeah, run up in that nigga house, pistol in that nigga mouth
But he be talking out his ass, what is all that shit about?

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Mulah, baby
And you still ain't seen a fucking thing until you C5

[Skit: Jacida Carter]
I still don't know today
Was he playing with the gun or was it an accident
I still... I just don't.... I.... I be wanting to ask him but I never asked him after all these years
Was that a accident or did he... or was he playing with the gun
So I never really found out about what...
You know what happ-... what really happened with him and that shooting

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
As I wipe the stars off the windows on my space ship
Call out the spirits in my basement
Crawl out the center of the snake pit
And fall into the middle of her greatness
Fireballs reflect off the frames of the pictures
She's not at all impressed with the flames or the flickers
But take her for a walk on the moon she wear her slippers
The end of the world is coming soon, I’ma miss it
The sky is falling down, I am falling for her quicker
We hide amongst the clouds, then we pardon the enigma
High above the ground but I'm under her charisma
Her sound is in surround when I'm in her solar system
The quiet calms my quasars, the eclipse is eclipsin’
My astronaut helmet kinda shifted, full of lipstick
Planet of the aches, and she is my prescription
We out of this world, baby, we have been evicted

[Chorus: Lil Wayne / Lil Wayne & Nicki Minaj]
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactical, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Open up the curtains
Window-watchin', people killin', robbin’
The sky is fallin’, fallin' down
I turn into news, and this is the apocalypse
People livin’ on their rocket ships
My mama always told me that there would be no stoppin' this
Fireball reflections on the friends and the pictures in my room
Of I and you
Tell me, will I see you soon?
Meet you on the moon?

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & (Lil Wayne) / Both]
Intergalactic love
The sky is falling, falling down
I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
I'll be waiting, I’ll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactic, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you (for you, for you)
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Intro]
Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me center my ego
When I think I'm bad like Michael
He bring me back down to Tito
Man in the mirror,, my hero
He helped me see like a eagle
He helped me hear enemies cry wolf
Then he see me take off my sheep clothes

[Verse 1]
Hasta la vista, adios
Beat the odds like mosquitoes
Keep in mind I'm a negro
So my open mind got a screen door
Bitches wan' come play the lead role
And end up with nothin' but B-roll
Sit on the dick in a C-4
Then I come back with a cheat code
Pill bottle only half full
But fuck it, my nigga, I'm past good
Sexy bitch rubbin' my tats good
But before she do, bitch, wash yo' hands good
I'm flexin' muscles that you can't pull
You can't make a fist 'cause I'm a handful
I never really knew my dad good
But still grew up to be the big bad wolf
You always see me with the white cup
Some people say that is a bad look
But take a good look at what you are lookin' at
You never know when it's your last look
It's written all over my face
It's tattooed, it can't be erased
One of a kind, I can't be replaced
In case that mirror breaks

[Chorus: Nivea]
Well it's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
Tryna get back right with ya
'Cause I've been on my own
Or at least that's what it feels like
Wanna get back right with ya
It's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like

[Post-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me center my evil
I see the fire in his eyes
But he keep my blood temperature zero
Man in the mirror, my 'migo
Crème de la crème de la Créole
Couple a cracks in the mirror
Even through the cracks, I see no cracks in me though

[Verse 2]
Daytime start to turn black
Everything stop like start to twirl
Thank God Weezy back
Order is restored, all is right with the world
Last time become lost time
No free time, 'til I bought time
No tea time, no off time
No me time, on y'all time
Blessings shower from the north side
From the brightest flower out the darkest skies
Love is blind but we caught eyes
It's a bumpy road but a joyride
Still can't ignore my rappetite
Like a hungry shark in a koi pond
Still the motherfuckin' best rapper, a-live
Nigga, y'all died

[Chorus: Nivea]
Well it's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
Tryna get back right with ya
'Cause I've been on my own
Or at least that's what it feels like
Wanna get back right with ya
It's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
'Cause I've been on my own
Or at least that's what it feels like
Wanna get back right with ya
Yeah It's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Man in the mirror, my hero
He got me center my ego
When I think I'm bad like Michael
He bring me back down to Tito
It's written all over my face
Tattoos that can't be erased
One of a kind, I can't be replaced
In case that mirror breaks

[Intro: Lil Wayne + sample]
"If it wasn't for Wayne, it wouldn't be"
"You tatted your face—"
Bugatti, new boo
"You screamed, 'Suu whoop'—"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
"You bought a Bugatti—", so you can flex
"And most of the bad bitches your ex"

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo, new subject, new paper, new class, new school
New buddies, new haters, new ass, new boobs, much later, too soon, too bad, too cool
Too hot, too lit, too high to move, two eyes to view but too blind to bloom
Who lied to you? Two middle fingers that's up high to whom it may consume
Kaboom, goddamn, who knew that I am the guru with voodoo that sued you to high hell
With shooters that shoot through the iron, man, and see through the con man and now he a dyin' man
I turned a goddamn into a God's Plan go over the diagram and get to the job, man
Watch for the spy cam, sit back and watch, and do not watch your watch hand, give me some time, man
I am the bomb, man, I am gon' swim 'til I come out on dry land or on the fryin' pan
No, we did not land on Plymouth Rock, but it landed on our land, now I'm just buyin' land
Back to the block where they got more rock fans than a fuckin' rock band under a rock, man
We need Barack, man, I do what I can to keep it solid as a-- you know what I'm sayin'
With some rock playin'

[Chorus: Sample + Lil Wayne]
"You tatted your face and changed the culture" (You changed)
"You screamed, 'Suu whoop,' and them gangsters loved you" (Yeah, yeah)
"You bought a Bugatti so you could flex" (So you can flex)
"And most of the bad bitches your ex"

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I started this shit, you just part of this shit, I'm the heart of this shit, and the heart doesn't skip
Take the heart of yo' bitch, 'cause like Bart, you a simp, and your water don't drip so your garden ain't shit
You just countin' the money, I'm drownin' in money, like, "Where the fuck is the lifeguard in this bitch?"
I go Mars in this bitch, watch me orbit and shit, for the art of this shit, Andy Warhol and shit
Go retarded as shit, you go sweet, tangy, I go tart on this shit, I'ma barf on this shit
I'm a martian and shit, you an orphan, lil' bitch, if I taught you some shit, that's like Harvard, lil' bitch
You ain't talkin' 'bout shit but you softer than shit, walk it like you talk it, now you walkin' in shit
I go Marvel movie on some marvelous shit, in the spotlight too long, should be darker than this
This is Tha Carter, lil' bitch

[Chorus: Sample + Lil Wayne]
"You tatted your face and changed the culture" (You changed)
"You screamed, 'Suu whoop,' and them gangsters loved you" (Yeah, yeah)
"You bought a Bugatti so you could flex" (So you can flex)
"And most of the bad bitches your ex"

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I started this shit, they borrowed this shit, I thought of this shit, they thought it was it
I'm doggin' this shit, they bark and they sit, put a fork in that shit, which drawer to look in?
I brought in this shit, the starters get benched, the orders get sent, then targets get hit
Billion dollar smile, I sell myself short if I grin, I'm bargainin' then
Apartments and shit, I could park in this shit in the foreign car that I could talk to and shit
With a cultural bitch I can talk to and shit 'bout the culture and shit, how I altered this shit

[Bridge: Lil Wayne + sample]
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo, tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
All of that shit, just Tha Carter, lil' bitch
You changed, suu whoop (You tatted your face)
Bugatti, new boo ("You screamed, 'Suu whoop'—")
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
Tunechi
("If it wasn't for Wayne, it wouldn't be")

[Outro: Sample]

Fucked her right good night, die wit' em open

Cocaine, bakin' soda, and some hot water
Kept the fiends comin' back to me, not karma
Smiled at my first kilo like a proud father
Smiled at my first judge like I'll be out tomorrow
Keep the Glock on 'em
All eyes on me, I had a Pac moment
This a Mannie Fresh beat and I go Pac on it
My homeboys proud of me like Barack homies
Your homeboys tired of me, I hope they die yawnin'

Ladies and gentlemen, C5, Wayne time

If you ain't got a lighter, what the fuck you smoking for?
We hot! (Haaa)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
What the fuck, though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo
You a roughneck, I'm a cutthroat
You're a tough  guy, that's enough jokes
Then the sun die, the night is young though
The diamonds still shine in the rough, ho
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, where the ones go?
It's a shit show, put you front row
Talkin' shit, bro? Let your tongue show
Money over bitches, and above hoes
That is still my favorite love quote
Put the gun inside, what the fuck for?
I sleep with the gun, and she don't snore
What the fuck, yo? Where the love go?
Trade the ski mask for the muzzle
It's a blood bath, where the suds go?
It's a Swizz beat, there the drums go
If she's iffy, there the drugs go
If she sip lean, double-cup toast
I got a duffle full of hundos
There the love go, where's the uproar?

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
I come out the scuffle without a scuff, woah
Puff, puff, bro; I don't huff though
Yellow diamonds up close, catch a sunstroke
At your front door with a gun stowed
"Knock, knock. Who's there?" is how it won't go
This the jungle, so have the utmost
For the nutzos, and we nuts, so
What the fuck, bro? It's where I'm from, bro
We grow up fast, we roll up slow
We throw up gang signs, she throw up dope
Dreadlock hang down like you dun know
Put the green in the bag like a lawnmower
Hair trigger pulled back like a cornrow
Extra clip in the stash like a console
Listenin' to Bono, you listen to Donald
What the fuck, bro? Where the love go?
Swizzy, he the chef, I like my lunch gross
Just look up, bro, there the Scuds go
I see the shovel, but where did bruh go?
Hmm, to the unknown
Only way he comin' back is through his unborns
If you see what's in my bag, think I'm a drug lord
It's empty when I give it back, now where's the uproar?

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
(Fly) Let it fly
Let it fly like the birds in the sky
Hotter than the weather in July

She just get so wet, I slip and slide
Had to get it back to give 'em five
I, I, I...

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Yeah, it's Mr. Michael Myers, man (Michael Myers)
Word to Moneybagg, I keep it comin' in (Woo, woo)
By the way we work, you think I had a twin (Twin)
I'm tryna run the game, it ain't no subbin' in (Naw)
You can't phase me, slidin' from a dangerous life (It's lit)
Always down to ball, I'm tryna drain these nights
See the smoke clouds through the entertainment lights
The way it go down we takin' fours and keepin' doors tight, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
We at the top, end of discussion (Discussion)
They mixin' alcohol and that 'tussin (Ooh)
The demon in their eyes and they clutchin' (Scared)
I feed 'em Adderall and they bussin', yeah (Pew-pew-pew-pew-pew)
I kept the towel, not throwin' in, I'm ridin' 'round in my ends
I got a driver for the Bent' to drive me 'round when I'm bent
I keep some pussy just to lick to help me out when I vent
She wanna hit that shit again, nah (Brr-brr)
(Brr-brr) That's the phone call, when my blood ring
It's Tha Carter V, let the thugs sing (Thugs)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Let it fly (Brr, fly)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne & Travis Scott]
It's alive, it's alive, I'm revived
It's C5, been arrived, kiss the sky, did the time
Please advise, it is advised to be advised, and we advise
You not fuck with me and mine, and keep in mind that we don't mind
Losin' our minds, free your mind, read your mind, read your mind
Body take a week to find, the cops gon' be like, "Never mind"
What's on your mind? Put the pistol to your mind and blow your mind
Control your mind, mind freak, no sober mind, I'm so behind
But front line, you crossed the line, and you better know your lines
And if you gettin' out of line, I hang you with a clothin' line
Wring you like an open line, keep your stanky ho in line
Them hoes be lyin', it's a thin line, and I know you know the line
Second line, second line, Tunechi got effective lines
Rough edges like a box of Checkers fries, that's a line
Catch the line, American flag, less stars, extra lines
Stretch the line, skip the line, 'til you no more next in line
Yeah, Tunechi-Tune a lunatic, my goonie-goons the gooniest
Run inside your room and kill you and who you roomin' with
The Uzi with the booty clip, more than one, I'm too equipped
Talkin' 'bout some fake niggas, based on true events
Tryin' not to get pinched, smokin' on a stupid stench
Lookin' in the mirror tryin' to figure where my pupils went
Flashy with a boujee bitch, Travy, that's my hooligan (It's lit)
Take the T off Tunechi and look at it as the crucifix, bitch

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Travis Scott]
C5, best rapper alive
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let it fly

[Chorus: Thomas Troelsen]
You cannot break down what can't be broken
Out of all the rankless, I was chosen
When all of the lights, they get low
And all of the curtains, they close
You cannot break down what can't be broken

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
They can do all they can do but they can't break unbreakable
They scared to face the truth because they hate the view
They taste the juice, I hope it make 'em puke, I'm breakin' loose
Should I throw up the deuce or should I wave the deuce?
In 1982, my momma taped me to a space shuttle
Say, now I'm raising you and ain't no baby food
Unless you go and take the neighbors' food
And be afraid of who, I made the loot
When money went from army green to navy blue
I said salute, bulletproof, I gave 'em proof
Sometimes feel like my head a screw, twisted like tornadoes too
Man, I'ma need some Krazy Glue
Her walls is what I'm breaking through
Her nails, she gone break a few
You can never break me down, and I can't hit the brakes for you
(errr!)

[Chorus: Thomas Troelsen]
You cannot break down what can't be broken
Out of all the rankless, I was chosen (Yeah)
When all of the lights, they get low (Low)
And all of the curtains, they close (They close)
You cannot break down (You can't) what can't be broken

[Post-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
G-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code
We bros (Can't be broken)
We bros, we bros, we can't break for these hoes
G-code (Can't be broken)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I ain't finna break or fix the brakes
You emulate, I'm laughing in your face
Now fix your face, I can't disintegrate, 'cause I facilitate a mil' a day
For like a million days
At least the bills are paid, the children safe
Want to get away? No, I'm here to stay
I'm really great, but don't discriminate
'Cause I done seen a mirror break behind a pretty face
You stickin' out your chest, your titties fake
Don't make me pick your fate
I'm pickin' out a mate, she get replaced
The heart was built to break
I'm smoking icky, watching Ricki Lake
I got a lawyer that turn any case into a pillow case
My killers straight, let's do some Q&A
You saw the news today
Got news to break and rules to break
It hurt to say, they want to get Lil Tune to break
It's worth the wait, commercial break

[Chorus: Thomas Troelsen]
You cannot break down what can't be broken (G-code)
Out of all the rankless, I was chosen
When all of the lights, they get low
And all of the curtains, they close
You cannot break down what can't be broken (Uhh)

[Post-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
G-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code
We bros (Can't be broken)
We bros, we bros, we can't break for these hoes, G-code
(Can't be broken)

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
If you saw me, would you understand
That I can't stand you with another man?
I see you happy where your life is at
I see you smile, I can't live with that

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
'Cause what about me? Yeah
I stayed up all night for you
Girl, girl, what about me? Yeah
I shut down my life for you
Now you run around with him, and him, and him
How you do that?
How you act like I never held you every night?
And now you never call back, please
Girl, girl, what about me?

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Oh, tell me do you ever think about it?
Those lonely nights when you 'bout lost it (Oh)
The only time that you would call
Was just to tell me it's my fault (Oh)
I let you cry, I let you worry
I let you yell, I let you hurt me (Oh)
I gave you everything you needed
Now you gone, gone, gone
Tell me, how you do that to me? Yeah

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Girl, what about me? Yeah
I stayed up all night for you (Yeah)
Girl, girl, what about me? Yeah (Girl, what about me?)
I shut down my life for you (I shut down my life)
Now you run around with him, and him, and him
How you do that? (Oh)
How you act like I never held you every night?
Now you never call back, please (Please)
Girl, girl, what about me?

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
Oh, girl, girl, girl, what about me? Me?

[Verse 2: Sosamann]
Do you think about me?
When I'm flying OT, I be up in them streets
You tellin' me that you gon' leave
Hittin' my phone with the beep (Boom!)
Knock it out, baby, creep
Oh, 'cause I just wanna see you smile
Did none of them tears ain't for you, baby
And they ain't matchin' yo style
I'm kickin' it flav with yo sauce
I'm counting them lovers
I'm thinking bout you, and all of the things that we used to do
And all of this you went through
Girl, I don't want you with no other dude, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Sosamann]
Girl, what about me? Yeah (Girl, what about me?) (Oh)
I stayed up all night for you (I stayed up all night) (Oh)
Girl, girl, what about me? (What about me, girl? Yeah, what about me, girl?)

Now you run around with him, and him, and him
How you do that? (How, girl?)
How you act like I never held you every night?
And now you never call back, please (Please)
Girl, girl, what about me? Me? (Yeah, what about me?)
Oh-ho-oh

[Intro]
Ah-em

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I ain't shit
Sometimes a nigga feel like shit
Talkin’ 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, "Dear Life" shit
So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it
I just hope I die for a reason
They probably won't miss me ’til they need me
Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord
I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, "Dear Life" shit
Way too concerned to be conceited
I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord
Die tryna reach 'em
They care more about how much I leave than
Where I leave it
I hope I leave more of an impression on my kids
To be destined to have blessings to believe in, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, "You're a son of a gun"
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, "I won’t hesitate to fuck a young nigga up", Lord
A few bitches left me, that only got a new bitch elected
My old bitch was too disrespectful
And only get my new bitch respected
That’s power, yes, it's now or next
Can’t lie though, I tried though
I'll die tryin', that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasin’ our dreams
Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I'll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is as it appears, oh shit
The object in the mirror is more near than it appears, oh shit
And sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird
He done died so many times but still here, why am I here?

[Chorus]
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?

[Verse 2]
Naked bitches really love ones
Sometimes our loved ones don't love us
I'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love
Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber
I just tell my lady, "Nothing's easy"
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
I can't deny it, you can't tame my lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string, I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but it's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real, the shit I'm talkin' way, way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
Gettin' high after I paid the bill, lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns, I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tags no mistakes, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice bath when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Mama told me, "Fuck the world and be so aggressive
Be self-fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive
Don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious"
'Cause if we could buy time, every store would sell it
If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling
I keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' a sober headache
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter

[Chorus]
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question I ask the reader, God bless the reader
Dear Life, what is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question

[Outro: Jacida Carter]
You know, when he told me Toya was havin' a baby, I say, "Y'all young. You know y'all young." But I said, "Be the best father you can be," you know. And truly, he is that.

[Intro]
Zaytoven

[Chorus]
If lovin' me is wrong, I don’t wanna be right, damn bitch, you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time I thought I was wrong and I was only mistaken
I live all alone, no house telephone, talk to you later
I’m never home, one time I thought I was home and it was only the matrix

[Verse 1]
Off button, pause button, stop button, lock button
Belly button, big ol' titties, she pop buttons, head buttin'
Versace button down unbuttoned to the top button
Percocets, that's my buttons, hit the pop button
Psychopath, blunt big, big as Mama June off the diet plan
Smokin' science lab
I should have a tattoo that say, "I am nothin' like my dad"
Jesus Christ, amen
My hand in the psychic's hand, she see righteous plans
I see business plans then I lose my mind and my attention span
She see empty hands like, "Oooh, Lordy," smellin' like Cool Water
Just got them new Cartier, the Rollie was too salty
That’s rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
My little bitch body a trophy
Naked pics, five in the morning, sunglasses, smilin’ emoji
Pull up on the opps, surprise party
Better get up and stand up like Bob Marley
That is your homie, he died for ya
Check your home screen, that's God callin’ (Hello?)
We makin' an impact, my nigga
We not just black, nigga, we rich and black, nigga
And all them bitches they been after niggas
They run away then they come limpin' back, nigga
Amen, feeling like Our Father
Should I get off my high horse to get on my flyin' horses?
That’s rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
My lil' bitch body'll solve it
And when you say, "Timber," please, will you whisper?
My nigga, I'm quietly fallin', shhhhh

[Chorus]
If lovin' me is wrong, I don't wanna be right, damn bitch, you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time thought I was wrong and I was only mistaken
I live all alone, no house telephone, talk to you later
I'm never home, every time I thought I was home it was only the matrix

[Bridge]
Hello? Hello? Rich nigga, rich nigga, rich nigga
That's rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
I got rich nigga problems, lil whoadie

[Chorus]
If lovin' me is wrong, I don't wanna be right, damn bitch, you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time I thought I was wrong, I was only mistaken
I live all alone, no house telephone, talk to you later
I'm never home every time I thought I was home it was only the matrix

[Verse 2]
Rest in peace, I rest in peace and harmony
I don't talk, I speak, after I pray, I preach
I don't play, I cheat, after I stay, I leave
The fork in the road, grab the fork and eat
Turn that piggy bank to some hog head cheese
But you doin' nothing, well they say, "Nothin' ain't never worth nothin', but it's always free"
Psychopath
Blunt thick, thick as Mama June off the diet plan, smokin' science lab
I should have tattoo that say, "I'm nothin' like your man"
Jesus Christ, Amen!
My hand in the psychic' hand
She see righteous plans, I see power plans
She take my hands put 'em in her pants
Do the hyphy dance then I wipe my hands
Feeling like Our Father
Should I get off my high horse to get on my flyin' horses?
That's rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
That's rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil whoadie

[Refrain]
You got penny pinch nigga problems, lil whoadie
On the bench nigga problems, lil whoadie
I got a bitch nigga problem, lil whoadie
More bitches more problems, lil whoadie
That's rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
What is this nigga problem, lil whoadie?
I got rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Yea

[Chorus]
If lovin' me is wrong, I don't wanna be right, damn bitch, you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time thought I was wrong and I was only mistaken
I live all alone, no house telephone, talk to you later
I'm never home, one time I thought I was home and it was only the matrix

[Sample: Lil Wayne & David Letterman]
Is it true you performed with Willie Nelson at the Country Music Awards?
I don't know, but I know I did perform at this bad ass bitch birthday party recently. She was crazy, stupid thick

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Mack in here
Pooh in here
Scoob in here with me

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tell them hoes get they mind right, tell them niggas back up
Man, I heard the truth is hard to swallow, do you have cups?
Used the rope to hang myself to tie a money bag up
Tell ’em get they iron right before Iron-Man come
Tell 'em bring my car around, tell 'em bitches lap up
I’ma cut this music down, tell 'em put they APs up
Tell 'em throw they pride out, roll the windows back up
Money in the air, who said white men can't jump?
Catch that nigga late night on the phone at a gas pump
Let me get the phone and the car once it's gassed up
AK-47 make a sittin' duck stand up
I could let it blast, but I much rather have one
Tell 'em bring my car around, tell 'em bitches lap up
Then them hoes get passed down, then them hoes get passed up
Sittin’ on this money to me feel like a cactus
I’m stickin' to this shit, you would’ve been have hopped yo' ass up

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Tell 'em, I got hittas woadie (Hittas woadie)
I got, yeah I got plenty woadie
I got hittas woadie (Hittas woadie)
I got, yeah I got plenty woadie (Plenty woadie)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I got hittas woadie, yeah I got plenty woadie
And they just wait for the word, this shit like Wheel of Fortune
Goddamn, these snitches nosy, goddamn, these snitches nosy
Nigga, I'm a ass with that semi; call me semicolon
Yeah I got hittas woadie, yeah I got plenty woadie
They kick the door and kill yo’ ass and leave the children snorin'
I'm sippin' lean out a glass, make me feel important
I made some green in the past and now it's good as golden, yeah

[Interlude: Katie Couric]
Clearly, Lil Wayne answers to no one

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I got hittas, woadie
I got, yeah, I got plenty, woadie (Plenty woadie)
I got hittas, woadie (Hittas woadie)
I got, yeah, I got plenty woadie

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & Drake]
I'm so lifted, I'm so lifted
I wrote my will in hieroglyphics (In hieroglyphics)
Weezy, where you been? The people miss you
Crickets
I got hittas and they not kidders, that's my niggas
You got niggas but they not hittas, they got jitters
They get hit up, I'm placin' figures on your niggas
Takin' bidders, yo' bae, yo' niggas, don't make a difference
I got shooters, on pharmaceuticals​, they armed and brutal
Armed intruders, 'cause we don't doodle, we draw conclusions
I got sprayers, all type of sprayers, we gon' need Google
I got paper, on top of paper, we gon' need rulers
I'm effective, been doin' numbers since Roman numerals
Strong as sumo, we armed as usual, my hittas hungry
Charleston Chew you, bazookas chew you, just like Bazookas
Don't confuse 'em, we only hittas, y'all only humans
Don't get hit up, woadie (Hit up, woadie, hit up, woadie)
'Cause I got hittas woadie

[Outro: Jacida Carter]
He's a very smart child. And I just said he was a genius, you know what I'm sayin'? Which I used to pray, and ask the Lord to send me one. You know, he did. He's so smart, I can't teach him nothin'. He's done been here before

[Chorus]
Momma said God took his time when he made me
I put my pride to the side, off safety
I'm on a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
I put my pride to the side, off safety
I'm on a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me (Yeah)
God took his time when he made me
I put my pride to the side, off safety
And look alive, look alive

[Verse 1]
Smoke one, ready to po' one, tote one, scared of no one
You never know when your close ones is a pussy 'til your nose run
Bickin' back bein' bool, trigger happiest goons
Bigger mansion and pool, I need a map for this room
Don't need a casket to view 'em, you can leave the rats in the sewers
I'm speedin' past in the newest soft top like the Jewish
Thrasher Sweatshirt, Vans on, all the bitches hands on
Fucked your bitch for a Sams card, a SIM card and an Android
Shots all in the airway, bullets make 'em do ballet
Pullin' triggers like hairspray, shoot 'em in the head, bad hair day
In broad day like "let's play," lil' kids playin' jump rope
Leave his body on the front porch, it's a cold world but the sun show
Where the paper and the drugs though, at your neighbor with the snub-nose
I be seen with the unseen, you be seen with the unknowns
All your bitches in the done zone, all my bitches in the fun zone
Swallowin' all my unborns, say it taste like a love song
In the cut like a cutworm, keep it cool, keep the cup warm
Rum-bum-bum-bum-bum, if they come for 'em, I tell 'em

[Chorus]
God took his time when he made me
Got my pride to the side, off safety
On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
Pride to the side, off safety
On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
God took his time when he made me

[Verse 2]
Sorry, boys, bar is closin', where we goin' for breakfast?
Put pressure on the precious, and put extra on the extras
Extra ready for my presents, extra sexy but she selfish
Just want me to see selfies of the pelvis, overwhelmin'
Talkin' money over salmon in Italian in Australia
Fuck it even have some salad, I'm just valuin' the value
Wake up and smell the azaleas sang her prayers like Mahalia
I just don't know what to tell ya, but, hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Devil lies jumpin' at ya, comin' from what's comin' at ya
I come from where they come at ya, in a way you can't come back from
I attack from every crack, while you been chillin', I been active
I been still inside the action, you been actin' I been buildin'
You been blabbin', you been bickerin'
I been blackin' I been sippin' like the Dracula
I been feelin' like Galactus
Got a million in the mattress, a gazillion in the pantry
If you don't know that I'm the answer, you should kill who you been askin'

[Chorus]
Momma said God took his time when he made me
I put my pride to the side, off safety
I'm on a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
Pride to the side, off safety
On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
God took his time when he made me
Pride to the side, off safety
Look alive, look alive

[Outro]
Look alive, look alive, yeah
Look alive, look alive
Momma said God took his time when he made me
Look alive, look alive
Carter Five, Carter Five, yeah
Carter Five, Carter Five
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Mmm...

[Chorus]
I don't know who you are anymore
Talkin' to the man in her mirror
That been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
But, you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care, so who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women
Puttin' cups up, gettin' fucked up

[Post-Chorus]
And, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's so fucked up

[Verse 1]
Damn, love don't live here
Love, I don't live here
She say, "Why you leave your shit here?"
I'm tryna be sincere
When we both know it ain't right
She hate that we can get loose
But I can never hang tight
But, we don't even make love anymore
Actin' like our phone got our attention
Though we watchin' television, and it's painless
We act like we strangers
I just don't know who we are anymore, damn
I'm not supposed to be here
'Cause love don't live here
But I'm here, and she here
She tell me stay all night
She just want a refill
And then she want to start fights
'Bout "What about how she feel?"
She tell me I'm a cheap thrill
I know she don't mean that
She think I feed her lies
But I don't get no feedback
As she watch me pack
"Baby where my keys at?"
Kiss her on the forehead and tell her that I'll be back
Her teeth smacked

[Chorus]
I don't know who you are anymore
Talkin' to the man in her mirror
That been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
But you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care
So who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women, puttin' cups up
Gettin' fucked up

[Post-Chorus]
And, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's so fucked up

[Verse 2]
I was talkin' to myself the other day
My homies call me cray, my mama tell me, "Pray"
She say, "I need a day", I said, "I need a bae"
She said, "Believe in faith
Ma, they love me either way"
Hold up, wait
Let me set my alarm
You say "Don't sweat your alarm"
And now the pressure is on
So now there's sweat in my palm
But her reception ain't warm
So my deception performs
And then that silence is awkward
Like am I deaf or alone?
I got a jet in the morn'
And she upset and I'm calm
And when a woman is scorned
Is when your welcome is worn
And now her temperature's showin'
And I just weather her storm
And she expect me to stay
I be like, "Let go my arm!"
She said...

[Chorus]
I don't know who you are anymore​
Talking to the man in her mirror
I've been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
And she say, you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care
So who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women, puttin' cups up
Gettin' fucked up

[Post-Chorus]
She say, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's what's fucked up

[Outro]
She say we don't make love anymore
Actin' like our phone got our attention
Though we watchin' television, now it's painless
We actin' like strangers
Like we don't know who we are anymore
Perfect strangers

[Chorus]
Because my days is a mess
My nights is a mess, my life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
Fuck it, my bae is a mess
My side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

[Verse 1]
She gon' have to excuse my ex
I'ma have to excuse her pets
She gon' have to be juicy wet if she gon' ride on this Tune Express
I'ma have to excuse her text
She gon' have to exclude the rest
She gon' have to tell dudes to step
Nigga, to the left, nigga, to the left
Messy, messy on some Percocets
Smoking purple veggie, that's my herbal essence
With a curvy, sexy woman hurting extra 'cause I'm working extra
I just heard her lecture, but I swerved the questions
And reserved a section with a bunch of bitches that prefer the pleasure
It's quarter-to-seven
They just heard the shower water runnin' in the morning
Dirty Devil, I'm a mess

[Refrain]
But I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
And I can hear her teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn into XO
Put yourself in my shoes but you got to tiptoe

[Chorus]
'Cause my days is a mess
My nights is a mess, my life is a mess
My life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
But fuck it, more ones, my bae is a mess
My side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

[Verse 2]
Yes, no pressure, it’s a jungle out here
Fell in love with a stripper, Lord, I know she got bills
But I'ma make it rain until she see a flood of ideas
Got me all up in my feelings without knowing what I feel
I'm a mess
And now she over talking about staying over
And she ask could she call her clan over?
I say that's the shit and now we asshole-ing
Now fast forward 'til the morning time
Broken glasses with a bunch of ashes, makeup, and lashes
Out of place mattress, shit happens 'cause my days is a mess

[Refrain]
I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
And I can hear her teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn into Petrol
Put yourself in my shoes but you got to tiptoe

[Chorus]
'Cause my days is a mess
My nights is a mess, my life is a mess
My life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
But fuck it, more ones, my bae is a mess
My side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

[Outro]
Yes, fuck it, more ones, fuck it, more ones
Fuck it more ones, fuck it, more ones
I'm​ making a mess with all of these ones
Fuck it, more ones, fuck it, more ones
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
But fuck it, more ones

[Verse 1]
Sleepin' with the enemy, my demons are too intimate
She's sleepin' very gently so now they're startin' to enter it
And now they're startin' to mentor me, geekin’ like Brittany
Tweakin' my energy, eat and die sympathy
Scream and cry infamy, come alive mentally
And love die physically, my love cry miserably
Hugs gettin' looser, her tongue tied kissin' me
She fucked thy niggas, see now they both iggin' me
But demons got dignity, demons got memories
I had a lil' revenge in me, so now I'm at sentencin'
'Bout to stop gigglin' and dinner start sizzlin'

[Bridge]
A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands
She agree to my demands too
Brought the demon out her ass too
I'm a demon, I demand you

[Chorus]
A demon with demands, a demon with demands
I'm a demon with demands, I got demons on demand
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a demon, I demand you
You brought the demon out the man, ooh
Brought the demon out the man, ooh
The demon out the man, you
Brought the demon out the man, ooh

[Refrain]
You done pulled the demon out the man, pulled the demon out the pants
Put the demon in your mouth then pulled it clean up out your ass
Took her demon by the hands, asked the demon, "Can we dance?"
Found a halo in her trash but she don't talk about her past

[Bridge 2]
A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands
A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands

[Chorus 2]
A demon with demands, a demon with demands
I'm a demon with demands, I got demons on demand
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a demon by demand too
Yeah, brought the demon out the man, ooh
She agree to my demands too
You done brought the demon out the man, ooh
Brought the demon out her ass too

[Verse 2]
Sleepin' with the enemy, my demons are too intimate
She's sleepin' very gently, so now they're startin' to enter it
And now they're startin' to mentor me, geekin’ like Brittany
Tweakin' my energy, eat and die sympathy
Scream and cry infamy, come alive mentally
And love die physically, my love cry miserably
Hugs gettin' looser, her tongue tied kissin' me
She fucked thy niggas see now they both iggin' me
But demons got dignity, demons got memories
I had a lil' revenge in me, so now I'm at sentencin'
'Bout to stop gigglin' and dinner start sizzlin'

[Bridge 3]
A demon, with demands
A demon, with demands

[Refrain]
You done pulled the demon out the man, pulled the demon out the pants
Put the demon in your mouth then pulled it clean up out your ass
Took her demon by the hands, asked the demon, "Can we dance?"
Found a halo in her trash but she don't talk about her past

[Outro]
Brought the demon out her ass too
You done brought the demon out the man, ooh
Demonic, demonic
Demonic, demonic
Demonic, demonic
Demonic, demonic, demonic
Demon with demands, demon with demands
Demon with demands, demon with demands

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I thank the Lord I'm not a broke nigga, I’m dope, nigga
Change my name, I ain't like average Joe, nigga
Up above wit' my above average ho, nigga
Tight frame with a tight cameltoe, nigga
I got killers on the front line, you on the sideline
Follow the guidelines or you be in the skyline
Killas on the inside, and on your blindside
Shoot you right between your motherfuckin’ eyebrows
Ooh, kill 'em—it's that "Carter V," let me get 'em
I'm feeling like John Gotti Lennon
And you gon' respect my mind and my sign and my emblem
You got money on your mind and we aimin' at your temple
Check me out or just be quiet in the library, nigga
Or the flowers on your grave gon' be dyin’ every winter
And as long as I’m alive I'm a financial wizard
Long as I can make a dollar out a dime and a nickle
Thank the Lord I’m not a broke nigga

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
I get money, I'm a hustler
So if you buyin' what I'm sellin’, you a customer
See I can get it to you anywhere, anything
But it's point-blank range when the pistol bang
I mix it up, I fix it up and I switched it up
I locked down this end and got it twisted up
See I'm a dog, but I loc with my locs
They say, "You are what you smoke"

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I grew up around dope niggas
Uh, uh, uh, dope niggas
I grew up around dope niggas

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I grew up around dope niggas and cold killers
And most niggas was both, nigga, two sport niggas
I was no different from those niggas, but I was chose, nigga
See those niggas saw more in me than these hoes, nigga
Momma was a go-getter, a coach, nigga
Taught me everything I know, nigga, a soul sister
Taught me how to be a goal tender, support system
For that bitch who played her role with ya and those children
I ain't lyin', slime, all my niggas balling, it's a fuckin' team sport
I could change the world, but I done lost the remote
All my niggas balling, that's how it's supposed to be, ho
I could change the world, I'd rather change to beast mode
Coke sniffers and dope stickers
And most niggas was both, nigga, explode, nigga
Pop a motherfuckin' cork, nigga, to those niggas
'Cause life's too fuckin' short, nigga—get old, nigga
I ain't lyin', got a gold mirror just to see my goals clearer
Be a role player, role model, while you roll with 'em
They say you don't need to be with us, stay on the road, nigga
That way I wouldn't come to the end of the road with 'em
Man, all my niggas targets, that's includin' me, ho
I could change the world, I'd rather change the people
And definitions 'cause we're defined by our legal roles
All your haters fuelin', and my needle broke
Lord, I ain't a broke nigga

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Lil Wayne]
I get money, I'm a hustler
So if you buyin' what I'm sellin', you a customer
See I can get it to you anywhere, anything
But it's point-blank range when the pistol bang
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga
I mix it up, I fix it up and I switched it up
I locked down this end and got it twisted up
See I'm a dog, but I loc with my locs
They say, "You are what you smoke"

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I grew up around dope niggas
Uh, uh, uh, dope niggas
I grew up around dope niggas
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga

[Intro]

[Verse]
Every nigga that's trippin' around me, serve as reminder that
I gotta watch my step
I keep it quiet as kept (Ayy, ayy)
Yeah, I think I spent most of my life depressed (Most of my)
Only thing on my mind was death (On my)
Didn't know if my time was next (Next, yeah, yeah)
Tryna refine this shit, I redefined myself
First I had to find it (Uh)
I couldn't find a friend, had to rely on my wits (Rely on my wits)
I be with Mike and Med (Mike, Med)
Nowadays I be with Sage and with Six-press, ya dig? (Press)
I'm in L.A. with Glen, please come and claim ya kid
I cannot play with them (Yeah, yeah, uh, whoa)
Let's try a different approach out
I celebrate with a toast
Brodie, you know if you with me we homebound (Homebound)
I need a city to hold down (Hold down)
You niggas gave me a coast (Yeah)
You went and gave me a cape (Cape)
But that never gave me no hope (Hope, yeah, hope, hope)
I found a new way to cope
It ain't no slave in my soul
But I keep the memories close by (Close by)
Even when I hit a low (I hit a low)
I still give thanks to the most high
I can't do favors no more
If you lame and you broke and you waiting for co-sign
I'll take a plate to go
Bread I could break with bro
Noose on my chain is gold
Tell me how you been faking the whole time? (Whole time)
That's a surveiller's goal
These niggas be playing for both sides
This shit could take a toll
There ain't no— (Bro)
There ain't no— (Yeah, shit)
It ain't no place to— (Uh)

[Outro]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Mm-mm-hmm

[Intro: Lady Gaga]
Do what you want

But then I trip upon myself and I fall

But then you print some shit that makes me wanna scream

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
So do what you want, what you want with my body

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Early morning, longer nights (yeah)

Crazy schedule, fast life

I could be the drink in your cup (cup)
I could be the green in your blunt
Your pusher man
Yeah, I got what you want (want)

After the show, it's the afterparty
It must be the remix, yeah
After the show, it's the afterparty
It's the afterparty
Gotta be the remix, yeah

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Sometimes I'm scared, I suppose, if you ever let me go
I would fall apart if you break my heart
So just take my body, and don't stop the party

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & R. Kelly, Both]
You can't have my heart and (help me now)
You won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body (with your body)

What you want with my body, world
Help me now

[Verse 1: Common]
Are we living in a dream world?
Are your eyes still green girl?
I know your sick and tired of arguing
But you can't keep it bottled in
Jealousy, we got to swallow it
Your heart and mind baby follow it
Smile, happiness you could model it
And when you feel opposite
I just want you to know
Your whole being is beautiful
I'ma do the best I can do
Cause I'm my best when I'm with you

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Come close to me, baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy
What's it without you?
(Nothing, nothing)

[Verse 2: Common]
Put down your bags love
I know in the past love
Has been sort of hard on you
But I see the God in you
I just want to nurture it
Though this love may hurt a bit
We dealing wit this water love
We dealing wit this water love
I want to build a tribe wit you
Protect and provide for you
We dealing wit this water love
We dealing wit this water love
I want to build a tribe wit you
Protect and provide for you
We dealing wit this water love

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Come close to me, baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy
What's it without you?
(Nothing, nothing)
Alright!

Well, baby
You know
How you
Are doing me wrong

Why you gotta be so mean?
Why do you gotta be?

Uh, I hang up
On you

But I can't
Wick it alone
I come
Everything goes wrong

Why you wanna put me down?
Fuck around all over town?
Uh, I hang up
On you

Well, baby
You know
How you
Are doing me wrong

Why you gotta be so mean?
Why do you always gotta be?

Uh, I hang up
That's what you want
Uh, I hang up
Uh, I hang up

[Chorus: Georgi Kay]
In my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
The dreams we had, the love we share
This is what we're waiting

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
In my mind, I’m a legend
In real life, I'm a legend
Can't stop, never stop winning
All this money flowing
In my time learned a lesson
They don’t like when I'm living
But I can't stop, can't be finished
You already know it
A thousand of miles, top ten, independence
Show my talents will get it
No less than a living legend
I took it to eleven from an Acura Legend, ya feel me?

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
My life and I li-li-li-li-live it
Got no tax and no credit li-li-li-li-limits
Well I guess I did it with the di-di-di-di-digits
My watch is so freezing, it's frigid
I winning, you winning, we winning

[Chorus: Georgi Kay]
In my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
The dreams we had, the love we share
This is what we're waiting

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
We all came from the bottom
We all came for the stardom
Started climbing the charts
And we ain't ever look back
This flyboy live no borders
Down Florida to Angola
Been down four in fourth quarters
But we ain't ever look back
Been on the top of levels since I leveled up
See I’m one in a milli-milli-milli-million
Trap is back and, damn, I feel like Serena
Hundred mill later, I feel like a leader

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
My life and I li-li-li-li-live it
Got no tax and no credit li-li-li-li-limits
Well I guess I did it with the di-di-di-di-digits
My watch is so freezing, it’s frigid
I winning, you winning, we winning

[Chorus: Georgi Kay]
In my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
The dreams we had, the love we share
This is what we're waiting

(In my mind, in my head)

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
My life and I li-li-li-li-live it
Got no tax and no credit li-li-li-li-limits
Well I guess I did it with the di-di-di-di-digits
My watch is so freezing, it’s frigid
I winning, you winning, we winning

[Chorus: Georgi Kay]
In my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
The dreams we had, the love we share
This is what we're waiting

(In my mind, in my head)

(In my mind, in my head)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
It was eye witnessing poverty
Burning bullets allowing these walls breaking
Devour these laws trying to empower me
I thought I knew the reason you grew to love sour diesel
Smoking like locomotive your focus was hourly
And then you caught me your pity party had towered me
Shower me with the will that never dried
I tell you put your worries and friendly doubts to the side
I doubt that you listen, it’s stuck in your system I tried
She’s been miserable, she’s been living in prison
Soaking up life’s reality this is the visual
Baby daddy a light build blade walking with highheel
Paid stalking that avenue, never knew how the light feel, I
Got a plan got a plan for ya
I just just might hold a couple bands for ya
And leave this message in the sand for ya
Tell me you’re ready to change
She said naw nigga it’s part of the game
Just like Heroin

[Chorus: Lance Skiiiwalker]
Streets don't fail me now need you right on time
Say, right on time
Please stay paced and the ground need you right on time
Say, you right on time
Streets don't fail me now need you right on time
Say, you right on time
God, please lift the smile need you right on time
Say, right on time

[Post-Chorus: SZA]
Runaway from the fire, I fly downhill
Lay your head over this side, now
You keep pain on the inside, now
Whats been eating you, who's been needing you
You been keeping it down, and
You been taking me higher and higher

[Verse 2: Punch]
Functioning addict, I’m high off her passion
Chasing history’s baddest, I mastered this apparatus
Rackin' my brain, I'm scared of being average
Going against the grain just tryna maintain my savage
Foolish of her to try to play towards my vanity
And foolish of me to let her do it, I love calamity
I love a challenge, naw I love the fantasy
And this is high stakes I risk it all for a pair of snakes
Connect the dot nigga this is fate
I'm talking predestination
I'm talking blind dedication
Plan B is contraception we didn’t make it
Sexercise a little bit of patience
The love of the rush is us
I'm addicted to violence, helicopters, and sirens
Blood pressure is skying, nigga I'm trying
I never felt more alive than I felt dying
Heroin

[Chorus: Lance Skiiiwalker & SZA]
Streets don't fail me now need you right on time
Say, right on time
Please stay paced and ground need you right on time
Say, you right on time
Streets don't fail me now need you right on time
Say, you right on time
God please lift the smile need you right on time
Say, right on time

[Post-Chorus 2: Isaiah Rashad & SZA]
I heard you spending all your time baby (Ohhhhhh)
And you could never get a dime baby (Never get a dime)
At least a nigga got a dime baby (At least a nigga got it)
It's hard to come home (Hard to come home)
It's hard to come home (Hard to come home baby)

[Verse 3: Jay Rock &  Kendrick Lamar]
She my gift and my curse, she really quenching my thirst
Baby my vice, she got me driving with no headlights (Is that right?)
She know my thoughts, pleasures, and pain
Everybody love her and she love everybody the same
She said I got a plan, got a plan for ya
I might hold a couple bands for ya
Leave a message in the sand for ya
Tell me you want me to change, hell naw I'm still sippin' the same
Nigga it's just like heroin

[Verse 1]
When I jumped off the porch
I was forced into last resorts of a temper gone short
And, of course, when that took its course
I was hoarse from yelling out
Demons that fought inside of me taught society how to rejoice
The killers on sight of me, privacy obviously was lost
And the fraud piracy of the streets in my odyssey
Caught a bullet that probably destroyed
A good kid in a mad city, slightly annoyed
I walked down the street with no heat
And run into beef when I'm just a vegan
Reekin’ the scent of a saint, sinner smell it then start squeezing
Pellets that's tumblin' straight at my melon, apparent reason
Probably was because of my cousin cuzzin’ a blood
That was bloodin' in public
And Kendrick seen with him last weekend, cousin
But you ain't no kin to me, 'stead of Kendrick, I'm Kennedy
Assassinate my character, sure that's your remedy
Fair enough, I got enemies but I don't bang
But that's the repercussions like
When your cousin is cuzzin’ a blood
Then you’re by yourself at the Compton parade, he said:

[Pre-Chorus]
Aye, look, homie, I gang-bang (Pump, pump)
A gang member, I'm active, I do my thing (Pump)
I do my stuff (Pump)
I’m really from the sect, tho (Pump, pump)
And if you is or ain't, I still need to know

[Chorus]
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay

[Verse 2]
I seen 'em from afar then I seen a piece of my jaw
Like on the ground, you know the sound
When you hear the people in awe
Sympathetic 'cause they like seeing you
Tryna fight back at a pack of piranhas
I promised three of ’em, beat the black off my back
And pajamas was almost needed
I should've went to sleep and seen some sheep
When I greeted the pavement
Got up and seen the shock on their faces
Like "damn it, he made it"
My luck in the palm of a cherry bomb
And they waitin' to blow up on me
My homies are not alarmed
Then I heard someone's firearm
Make a sound like it waved around my direction
I'm guessing this is the part where my heart
Expected to drop in a second, look at the faults
I've made in the shortest amount of time
And in back of my mind I'm like "this the loss I'ma take"
My fate was distraught
A cape and some superpowers can't save me
I'm probably pushing up daisies
Before I can make my way to the car
Cross cancel and right before I seen
The black glove raisin' the handle, he said:

[Pre-Chorus]
Aye, look, homie, I gang-bang (Pump, pump)
A gang member, I'm active, I do my thing (Pump)
I do my stuff (Pump)
I'm really from the sect, tho (Pump, pump)
And if you is or ain't, I still need to know

[Chorus]
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay

[Verse 3]
Bitch, I'm bustin' back, I'ma borrow my uncle's strap in a minute
Jump in a Civic then wear that bitch on my lap
I was timid but now I'm tempted
And tenants alert me on where you at
I'm a menace when I'm offended, relentless, I will react
Then somebody said the dispatch
Of an officer, got his mind made on off'n ya
That's a fact when you're black and undeveloped
You're profiled as a felon
I'm bailin' down Boulevards with my basketball and a backpack
Gym shoes and my nap sack
Hair nappy, my ball cap backwards
And then I look back, strobe lights on my tail pipe
Turned left then I turned right
Turned deaf 'cause the sirens is loud
As the colors of pink and yellow on Wesley Snipes
Pray to God I don't get sniped
Pray to God that the sunlight stay shining for 30 more minutes
Hope that a witness around when I'm 'bout to cut off the engine
Vengeance of hatred is what I'm facin'
Even though being a criminal ain't my memo
But this is what he said when I dropped the window:

[Pre-Chorus]
Aye, look, homie, I gang-bang
By the time you hear the next shot, you'll learn that L.A.P.D. is the biggest gang (Pump)
I do my stuff (Pump)
I'm really from the sect, tho (Pump, pump)
And if you is or ain't, I still need to know

[Chorus]
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay

[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Ha-ha-ha, ha, uh

[Verse]
I said chilling in my tipi, no Indian but he be
The realest shit, I must admit, I'm basking in my feces
My style is harder, yours is watered down, Fiji
The bible or my CD? Both of them are said to be the
Formula to live your life, or coping with the ills
No time to play kid, I think you needs to chill
Houseparty with killers, pray for it to defill us
Where exes think it's buffy, and chandeliers hang from ceilings
I'm dreaming, I'm scheming to be major
Composer like I'm Mozart, the sequel to Amadeus
Today is, the day I see the sun, ignoring all the rain
The fat lady has sung, octaves as high as planes
Paper by the forest tree, acres of the THC
I don't smoke but homies do, find a cloud then have a seat
Wonder how Meyer Lansky live to see 80
I just wanna see Mercedes give me head in Mercedes
'Knahmean?

[Pre-Chorus]
And guess what?
I need all of mine's—mo' paper, mo' dough
I need all of mine's—more pussy, more hoes
I-I need all of mine's—and yeah, publishing, can't forget publishing
Nigga

[Chorus]
Just ride, don't ask where we going (Ay)
Journey through the sky, cloud nine, no Boeing (Ay)
Baby take your time, I'ma keep it in control and
Give you what you need and give you what you want in life

[Outro]
I need all of mine's
I need all of mine's
I-I need all of mine's
Just ride, don't ask where we going
Journey through the sky, cloud nine, no bowing
Baby take your time, I'ma keep it in control
Give you what you need and give you what you want in life

[Chorus]
You can own this city
You have everything you need
All it takes is all you got
Life don't ask you if you're ready or not
You can own this city
Deep inside you hold the key
While the world is fast asleep
You can take it all if you just dare to dream

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Talk about goals
Talk about a pen and a pad and the pad of your house
With a permanent flow
Hennessy on the floor looking at a video on the couch
And the couch is cold
And the pouch in your mama pocket got a permanent hole
And your brother pout 'cause he want food on the stove
And a pedestal with a silver spoon, and a big pool
With a big room and a closet, cause it
Hurt when you laughing at his clothes
Looking at him like he ain't shit
Forever living in that commode
Time flies and I watch it tick
Look in the mirror and I gotta take risk
Like blood on the sheet of a suicide note
Tripod then I aim it at your soul
For bright lights
Bite like a alligator when I write
Hungry, come see determination upon me
Come see the visionary in my sight
My life premeditated by ambition
Pistons from my Nikes take off
No assistance, I'm persistent
Adolf, more than I can chew with this thought

[Chorus]
You can own this city
You have everything you need
All it takes is all you got
Life don't ask you if you're ready or not
You can own this city
Deep inside you hold the key
While the world is fast asleep
You can take it all if you just dare to dream

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Let's talk about pressure
Let's talk about depression
Let's talk about desperate
Times
Everyday I'm guessin'
My mind, It'll never end up resting
I climb a ladder every second
I find another mountain top
Another video I watch when that video go off
I jot like Edgar Allen, matter fact a thousand
Soldiers never could war off my talents
I wanna reassure my talents
I wipe my face but never throw my towel in
I'm often prowlin'
The edge of a quantum jump in my head
I'm a monster from anywhere but Earth
And I'm 1 of 1 ever since my birth, I came for some bright lights
Bite like a bear trap when I write
Hungry, gotta chip on my shoulder
I took it off and ate it
I made it a full meal
And I'm still craving, my front teeth
I sink in the rap game
My name will attract fame
My veins got the blood of a king in it
When it pours down, now Snoop's on stage and he say
"Kendrick"

[Chorus]
You can own this city
You have everything you need
All it takes is all you got
Life don't ask you if you're ready or not
You can own this city
Deep inside you hold the key
While the world is fast asleep
You can take it all if you just dare to dream

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
So what you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
You can run, you can hide
But when you are chosen
The walls they close in
Your forefathers look you in your eyes
So what you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
You can run, you can hide
But when you are chosen
The walls they close in
Your forefathers look you in your eyes

[Chorus]
You can own this city
You have everything you need
All it takes is all you got
Life don't ask you if you're ready or not
You can own this city
Deep inside you hold the key
While the world is fast asleep
You can take it all if you just dare to dream

[Intro]
Oh, lord, oh, lord
Pretty ass girl over there, come play on ma nappy hair! (*Laugh*)
Drizzy Drake, here we go, look

[Verse 1]
Bitch, I'm gettin’ it how I live, I put that on my left rib
25 with no kids but this dick you can babysit
25 lighters in the sky, what life is a real nigga
20 Al-Qaeda bomb when I do sight 'fore I kill niggas
Passion my preference, Benjamin Franklin my medicine
The MVP let him in, I'ma fuck up his letterman
Jackets with pendants on them
And I got plenty war story, politic never depended on ’em
Uncle Sam never did shit for me, momma made miracles
Choppers drove me hysterical, cartoons and cereal
Pyramids on Imperial, that's the projects
And I make that progress from a tedious process
I'm a problem better yet a prospect, fuck that I'm a Loch Ness monster
Conquer, Compton, Hail King K-Dot, aka them casings of AK just sprayed your way uh, compensate for shooting for the stars muhafucka, click, brrt
Shooting up the charts, muhfucka
See, a rich nigga will buy anything that you sell 'em
A broke nigga believe anything that you tell 'em
I let smokers pump my gas, but I do that very seldom
Drop your ass at the unemployment, the only way I help 'em
They call me a role model, I'm still a baby myself
Hungover from last night, got to speak at your school at 12
Hennessy with the Sprite had me bouncing like Rumpelstiltskin
They caught me rummaging through women, I’m laughing like Elliott Wilson (*Laugh*)
Pay me respect and pay me on my checks
My first 50 thousand collected paid off some street debts
You know killers that looked out for me back when I was hungry
We go back like Reebok classics and black and blue saucony
I got a genuine clean slate, never you ask for my fucking rate
Never I’m handing out favors, bitch, every show now is 200k
As I write down my new bucket list, I can look down on your fucking hate
Get the fuck up when I'm in your presence, you listen when I fucking say

[Outro]
"What the fuck you niggas want from me? The only nigga that I owe is God!
Huh? Huh? Drizzy
What the fuck these niggas want from me? The only nigga that I owe is God!"
Christmas time is here
Happiness and cheer
Fun for all that children call
Their favorite time of year
Snowflakes in the air, yeah
Carols everywhere, oh
Olden times and ancient rhymes
Of love and dreams to share
Sleigh bells in the air
And beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there
Christmas time is here
We'll be drawing near
Oh, that we could always see
Such spirit through the year

Yeah, Christmas time is here
We'll be drawing so near
Oh, that we could always see
Such spirit through the year
Oh, celebrate, celebrate, celebrate, yea
It's Christmas time, yeah
Mmm, celebrate, celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate, oh oh oh it's Christmas time right now
It's here, it's here celebrate, celebrate, celebrate

[Verse 1: SZA]
I know I wanted to be your pretty lover
I only wanted to be your undercover
And now you can't commit, baby, now you're throwing fits
'Cause your phone ain't ringing like it used to do
How do you feel?
Now you wanna take it back, now you wanna ghost somebody
Why you gotta treat me like that, you're already with somebody

[Refrain: SZA]
Suddenly I don't understand, when I call, when I come by
I don't need no man

[Chorus: SZA]
Suddenly you wish we were back together
Telling me you wanna get back together
Just the way you had me was so much better
Say you didn't think it would be forever
(Ooh)

[Verse 2: SZA]
I don't know I just, I have better things to do
Better men to call, better time to spend an'
How d'your man try to get you up, get you up, get you-
How do you look good, when you put it like that?
How d'you look good, when you put it like-
How d'your man try to get you up, get you up, get you-
How do you look good, when you put it like that?
How d'you look good, when you put it like-

[Open Verse]

[Refrain: SZA]
Suddenly I don't understand, when I call, when I come by
I don't need no man

[Chorus: SZA]
Suddenly you wish we were back together
Telling me you wanna get back together
Just the way you had me was so much better
Say you didn't think it would be forever
(Ooh)

[Verse 3: SZA]
Hello? Yeah, I hear you
Yeah, yeah, I've seen you calling
Six times, I don't know, I just
I have better things to do, pass the times it's-

[Refrain: SZA]
Suddenly I don't understand, when I call, when I come by
I don't need no man to fly, maybe we

[Verse 4: SZA]
Maybe we get back, maybe we don't
Maybe we call, maybe it's gone
Maybe you'll love me, maybe you won't
(Ooh)
We'll see, come again, we can talk about it
Suddenly you wanna, call on, or love on, or hold on to my-
Well call them other girls
You can try, you can see, if it works, gladly
I'm a little bored, I got a little more things to entertain my time
And summer getting real close, weather getting real hot
Shorts getting real short, skin getting real tight

[Bridge: SZA]
(Back together)
I don't want a place for you
(Back together)
I don't even have a place to even begin getting back to you
(So much better)
I think you've run its course
(Be forever)
I think you've reached the end of the line, darling
I think you've reached the end
Keep it classy, don't cry
I know it hurts, I know you want it
I know you long for the love
So "back together" sounds like an old tune
Like a holiday since passed
Just a call I won't answer no more

[Outro: SZA]
(Back together)
(Back together)
I'm onto new things, new sounds, new feels, new times
(So much better)
And you old news (Be forever)
You old news, I can't stand it (Ooh)
I don't know I just

[Chrous]
That pussy got a spell on me
That pussy got a spell on me
That pussy got a spell on me

That pussy got a spell on me

That pussy got a spell on me
That pussy got a spell on me

[Chorus: The Younghearts]
We got love, love, love
You better believe it

[Verse 1: Teyana Taylor]
I got house and a carriage, yeah
I got Black love and marriage, yeah
They gon' say you can’t have it, but
I'm like, "Don't kill the messenger"
We gon’ break the stigma up
Huxtables turned to Obamas
It ain't about where you been, where you from
What you got
It's all about love
Self-love is the best love
When you gon' take that wristband off?
That pity party been over
Don't need make-up to dress you up
I gave birth on the bathroom floor
Just me, Iman, and headphone cords
Don't let this life defeat you
I hope this message reach you

[Refrain: Teyana Taylor]
Throw your hands up
Play catch with the hunnids, love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies, home is where the heart is
Throw your hands up
Play catch with the hunnids, love is the new money
I’m just chillin’ with the homies, home is where the heart is, ahh!

[Chorus: The Younghearts & Teyana Taylor]
We got love, love, love
You better believe it (Say, love, love)
We got love, love, love
You better believe it (Say, love, love)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I live in abundance, love is the new money
I'm mentally wealthy, spiritually conscious
I’m fresh out of Onyx, I'm ballin', I'm ballin’
I play with the hunnids, love is the new money
That's my frequency, spark up, burn the sage
Clear the room, heal the hate, love is the new wave

[Refrain: Kanye West]
Play catch with the hunnids, love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies, home is where the heart is
Play catch with the hunnids, love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies, home is where the heart is (Ahh!)

[Chorus: The Younghearts & Teyana Taylor]
We got love, love, love
You better believe it (Say, love, love)
We got love, love, love
You better believe it (Say, love, love)

[Refrain: Teyana Taylor]
Play catch with the hunnids, love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies, home is where the heart is, ahh!
Play catch with the hunnids, love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies, home is where the heart is, ahh!
(Throw your hands up, throw your hands up)

[Outro: Lauryn Hill]
Above all you keep your clarity
You keep your focus
You keep your sense of love
And you keep your sense of purpose
Those are, they're integral
You know, they're key
Happiness
You know, um a lot of people define success differently
You know for me
You can have everything
You could have all the money in the world
But if its not enjoyable, if its not sustainable, you know
If you can't be a person of integrity while having all these things
What does it matter?
What does it mean?
Your value is internal
Your value is internal

[Verse 1]
Mortal once again
Making out what's make-pretend
And you whisper words forbidden
To see if I've been listening
Well, now I'm listening

[Verse 2]
We won't both get our way
If we do, it won't be tonight anyway
So I hold you by the jaw
And kiss you to be sure
With so much more than before

[Chorus]
It took a wild heart to tame mine
And it took a wild heart to charm
Now a wild heart's gone and floored me
With this everlasting glance
With this everlasting glance

[Post-Chorus]
I wouldn't have you any other way
Who wants a love that makes sense anyway

[Verse 3]
I guess I asked for the truth
I guess I asked for it brutal and untuned
But tonight, it sounds improvised
Whatever has you so inspired
Well, I know you're inspired

[Verse 4]
And no one is better armed
To tear me down with a sleight of the tongue
And I could do the same
And see how long you can keep face
Let's see you keeping face

[Chorus]
But it took a wild heart to tame mine
And it took a wild heart to charm
Now a wild heart's gone and floored me
With this everlasting glance
With this everlasting glance

[Post-Chorus]
I wouldn't have it any other way
Who wants a love that makes sense anyway
I wouldn't have you any other way
I don't want a love that makes sense anyway

[Chorus]
But it took a wild heart to tame mine
And it took a wild heart to charm
Now a wild heart's gone and floored me
With this everlasting glance
With her everlasting glance

[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
Coo-coo
Yeah!

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg & Merlyn Wood]
Shit on your function, live from the dungeon (Woo, damn)
Don't know why you cuffin', my dick, she be tonguin'
You ain't got drip like this, can't talk like this (Woo)
Safety pin on wrist, I put racks on my lil' bitch, uh
Speak of the truth, two K a tooth, oof
Maybach Jeep, huh, raise the roof
Know that you envy me, but I am hater-proof
Talkin' with Diddy, I made me a milli' in about a day or two
Woo, ayy, filled with lust
Wanted to hear what Hype Williams talkin' 'bout
Bitches that I wanna bust
We supposed to be talkin' 'bout video treatments and such (Damn)
But I'm busy lovin' on the IG, smut, damn, fuck
I'm a G.O.A.T. in a Lamb' truck
Tell the video, "Pan up when you talk to me"
Godzilla, trilla nigga, rip apart cities (Coo-coo)
Side niggas in the pocket of my varsity (Damn)

[Pre-Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Merlyn Wood]
They couldn't take that from me
They want love, they got me, listen
You ain't have many friends, but you the shit to me (Bankroll)
Every time you at a party, it's a scene (Bankroll)
Always had to save you from a sunken thing (Bankroll)
Sunken place always comin' in your dreams (Bankroll)

[Chorus: Matt Champion & A$AP Rocky]
Lump up in my jeans, I got a bankroll (Bankroll)
Never show them that lil' green, I keep a bankroll (Bankroll)
And I'm walkin' with a limp, got too much bankroll (Bankroll)
Huh, huh, I got too much bankroll

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Won't take off my armor now
Can't afford not to splurge on her
Had to break down the Berlin Wall
Just to come talk to ya
Who hurt ya? I'll break his jaw
Young, handsome, with major plans
Know I'm harsh to my consonance
Know I'm harsh to my consonance
Make her run like the Boston bomb
I'm the one, yeah, the one she wants
Wanna love me like Wimbledon
Raise the volume, ring alarm
Hands on my girl, it's a charm
Got passion, don't call it loud
Don't tell my shorty, "Settle down"
I wear out like a hand-me-down
Don't say I'm too big for ya
Man, my head big, it's fallin' off
But I fit, no problem
Make it fit like nuts and bolts
One nut and I'm boltin' off
Your ex income minimum
Baby run with some bigger dons
Baby run with some bigger dons
I got the cash and it last 'cause I dash to the bag
My ice white like rice, diamonds flash like the light, ayy

[Pre-Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Merlyn Wood]
They couldn't take that from me
They want love, they got me, listen
You ain't have many friends, but you the shit to me (Bankroll)
Every time you at a party, it's a scene (Bankroll)
Always had to save you from a sunken thing (Bankroll)
Sunken place always comin' in your dreams (Bankroll)

[Chorus: Matt Champion & A$AP Rocky]
Lump up in my jeans, I got a bankroll (Bankroll)
Never show them that lil' green, I keep a bankroll (Bankroll)
And I'm walkin' with a limp, got too much bankroll (Bankroll)
Huh, huh, I got too much bankroll

[Verse 3: Jabari Manwa]
Wanna be my main bitch? You gotta get the cream
To roll around me in the Grenadines
You gotta come through lookin' pristine
'Cause this bankroll is flowin'
Aim for the neck, I ain't goin' (Uh)
Yeah I'm gettin' money like a bank machine (Uh)
It got me lookin' legit and they know it (Yeah)
Yeah I'm countin' up, ain't gotta show it off
See me in your spot, low-key throwin' you off
If you talkin' 'bout cash in my ear like a kitty
You know that it's stayin' up
If you ain't on that, move back, bro
Don't even talk to the gang, no
Walkin' 'round, tool with the bankroll
Keep puttin' stacks in the bank, bro

[Outro: Merlyn Wood & A$AP Rocky]
You ain't have many friends, but you the shit to me
(Now catch the compensation)
Every time you at a party, it's a scene
(Change the conversation)
Always had to save you from a sunken thing
(Dollars, all I'm chasin')
Sunken place always comin' in your dreams
(Fuck is you sayin'?)

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I'm findin’ ways to articulate the feeling I'm goin' through
I just can’t say I don't love you
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
You know what I'm thinkin'
See it in your eyes
You hate that you want me
Hate it when you cry
You’re scared to be lonely
’Specially in the night
I'm scared that I’ll miss you
Happens every time
I don't want this feelin'
I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain’t workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh!

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Even though we're going through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind, 'cause, baby
I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah

[Verse 2: SZA]
I'm finding time to catch a wave
Hop in the car with you
Hoping to find the time to feel good
Wanna fight less, wanna build more
Wanna be your type, change your world
Share your life, be the only girl
Who got you tripping and moving like you don't know me
I put the bitch in position, she really owe me
Nah to 9 to 5, we do this all the time
Will you call me when I'm on your mind
Baby, can you

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
You know what I'm thinkin'
See it in your eyes
You hate that you want me
Hate it when you cry
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh!

[Chorus: The Weeknd & SZA]
Even though we're going through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby
I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah

[Bridge: The Weeknd & SZA]
I would die for you
I would lie for you
Keep it real with you
I would kill for you, my baby
I'm just sayin', yeah
I would die for you
I would lie for you
Keep it real with you
I would kill for you, my baby
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na

[Chorus: The Weeknd & SZA]
Even though we're going through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby
I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah (Oh, babe)
(Die for you)

[Verse 1]
Sit enthroned in white grandeur
But tired
And shift a wisp of wayward silver hair
From your eyes
I'd never seen you unkempt before
As you whisper darling close the door
Well, how have I not made a note of every word
You ever said
And time is not on our side but I'll pretend that it's alright
She says the Lord has a plan
But admits it's pretty hard to understand

[Chorus]
Before you leave
You must know you are beloved
And before you leave
Remember I was with you

[Verse 2]
Are you afraid
However could you not be
In this rosy light
This is strange
I feel a hand come through the mirror
Pointing at the light
Point at the light we never see
As you put your feathered arms over me

[Chorus]
Before you leave
You must know you are beloved
And before you leave
Remember I was with you
And as you leave
I won't hold you back beloved

[Bridge]
We'll sit and talk the stars down from the sky
And I'll not forget the chaos in your eyes love

[Chorus]
And as you leave
You must know you are beloved
And as you leave
I can see the wild has come for you
And as you leave
I won't hold you back beloved
And as you leave
See my children playing at your feet

[Verse 1]
We saw birth and death
Can't we be still
What makes you kind
From where comes your sparkling mind

[Verse 2]
Was it under the earth
Tied up in a knot
Which I forgot you were ever there

[Bridge]
Do not be afraid
Do not be afraid

[Chorus]
What’s that I see?
I think it's The Wild
Puts the fear of God in me

[Verse 4]
It was ever thus
Up from the dust
Inconceivable love

[Chorus]
What's that I see?
I think it’s The Wild
Puts the fear of God in me

[Verse 1]
No more questions no more lies
Do a deal for no surprises
Cos you will never slip away
Slip away in the night

[Verse 2]
Waiting patient for the sun to rise
It reveals a stoic smile
But you will never slip away
Slip away in the night

[Chorus]
You'll find me waiting here for you
Come and suffer here
You'll find me holding my breath for you
Come and suffer here

[Verse 3]
In the violence of a mind's eye
We had a deal for no surprises
Cos you will never slip away
Slip away in the night

[Refrain]
But you're not yourself
I know you better than you
But you're not yourself
I know you better than you

[Chorus]
You'll find me holding my breath for you
It's never more than I can take
I wouldn't have it any other way
You'll find me on my knees for you
It's never more than I can take
I wouldn't have it any other way

[Break]
Go gently now
Be still
And love
Go gently now
Be still
And love
Go gently now
Be still

[Chorus]
You find me holding my breath for you
It's never more than I can take
I wouldn't have it any other way
You'll find me on my knees for you
It's never more than I can take
I wouldn't have it any other way

[Outro]
But you're not yourself
I know you better than you
And you're not yourself
I know you better than you

[Verse 1]
Fold your hair behind your ears
Roll your questions across the floor
I know we've been here for years
But at least we been here before
My mind finds peace in the shade of your attention
But gets tangled by the night
I didn’t know what I was thinking
But I know we'll be alright

[Chorus]
And I will surround you
With a love too deep for words
Hold you from the world and its curse
So long as I have breath in my lungs
Long as there's a song to be sung
I will be yours and you will be mine
Ever our lives entwined
My Rose of Sharon
My Rose of Sharon

[Verse 2]
Come crashing in like a wildfire, I’m left in awe of you
Every time I close the door, I'm left wanting more of you
I wish I had some grand sense of occasion
But I just smile and turn away
I hope you know by now
I don't know another way

[Pre-Chorus]
When it's said and done
I am yours forever
Like I said, I'm done
I am yours forever

[Chorus]
I will surround you
With a love too deep for words
Hold you from the world and its curse
Long as I have breath in my lungs
Long as there's a song to be sung
I will be yours and you will be mine
Ever our lives entwined
My Rose of Sharon
My Rose of Sharon

[Outro]
With a love too deep for words
I am yours forever
With a love too deep for words
I am yours forever
With a love too deep for words
I am yours forever
With a love too deep for words
I am yours forever

[Verse 1]
If I could tell you no
I thought it best you didn't know
Don't see it coming
The darkness visible
But when its eyes fix mine
It's silver and it's stone
I feel it rising, oh
The gathering storm

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I feel that darkness is a heartbeat away
And I
Don't know how to fight it
It's a heartbeat away
And now
You don't know me like this
It's a heartbeat away
And I
Don't know how to hide it
It's a heartbeat away

[Chorus]
And I picture you
Soaked in light
I picture you
And in you I have no doubt
When the chaos calls me out
And it feels like there is nothing I can do
I picture you

[Verse 2]
And the night falls fast
I know it's heavy on the skin
Will it be ever thus
Barely visible
But when your eyes fix mine
Embracing your denial
Well I hold my breath
Through the waste and the wild

[Pre-Chorus]
When I feel it rising
And it's a heartbeat away
And I
Don't know how to fight it
It's a heartbeat away
And now
You don't know me like this
It's a heartbeat away
And I
Don't know how to fight it
It's a heartbeat away

[Chorus]
And I picture you
Soaked in light
I picture you
And in you I have no doubt
When the chaos calls me out
And it feels like there is nothing I can do
I picture you
There to dwell
In adamantine chains and penal fire
Who durst defy the Omnipotent to arms
Nine times the space that measures day and night

Rolling in the fiery gulf
Confounded, though immortal: But his doom
Reserved him to more wrath; for now the thought
Both of lost happiness and lasting pain
Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes
That witnessed huge affliction and dismay
Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate:
At once, as far as Angels ken he views
The dismal situation waste and wild
A dungeon horrible, on all sides round

Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace
And rest can never dwell, hope never comes
That comes to all: but torture without end
Still urges
As one great furnace flamed, yet from those flames
No light, but rather darkness visible

[Intro]
Yes, this is for all you, no business barn rats, soup eatin' junkyard pepper guts 

[?]
Tired, wrinkled ass motherfuckers, this is for y'all, from the Dogg
The Dogg of all dogs, the top dog
Snoop Doggy Dogg, listen
Where do I turn to when there's no choice to make?
How do I presume when there's so much at stake?
I was so sure of it all

What if I need you in my darkest hour?
What if it turns out there is no other?
If this is our last hope
We would see a sign, oh
We would see a sign

Well I've been running from the ashes we left
Forgiveness begs for itself but how can I forget
There's a stain on it all

But what if I need you in my darkest hour?
What if it turns out there is no other?
We had it all
If this is our time now
We wanna see a sign, oh
We would see a sign
So give us a sign
I need some guiding light
Children of darkness, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
In the silver light
I just made out
Your silhouette
Through the quickening haze
So brand it on my mind
So I don't forget
Let it shine
By wandering eyes

Oooh, your love endures
Oooh, I have faith for the rest

I'm blinded by the lights
Of October Skies
These postcard memories
Evade my eyes
And in the valley I am free
But in the hills I soar
Until your silhouette
Is gone once more
Oooh, your love endures
Oooh, I have hope once more

The fear of what's to come
Has been crippling me
So to your silhouette
I turn once more
So brand it on my mind
So I won't forget
Let it shine, let it shine
By my wandering eyes
Oh let it shine, let it shine
By my wandering eyes

Oooh, your love endures
Oooh, I have hope once more

[Verse 1]
Our time is up
Your eyes are shut
I won't get to tell you what
I needed you to know
It's dark enough
The moonlight doesn't show
And all my love
Could never bring you home

[Chorus]
There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
You're all that's on my mind
I called a thousand times
And I have to let you go
But I love you more and more than you could know

[Verse 2]
I sat alone
Awaited your reply
Was driven home
When I started to cry
I should've known
I should've said goodbye
I only hoped
I would've had more time

[Chorus]
There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
You're always on my mind
When I called a thousand times
And I have to let you go
But I love you more and more than you could know-oh

[Bridge]
Oh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-ra-da
We're both too young
To live and die this way
A sunny summer day
With so much left to say
Not 21
The 18th hell to pay
The day you couldn't stay
You made me wanna pray
But I think God's fake

[Chorus]
There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
You're all that's on my mind
When I called a thousand times
And I have to let you go
But I love you more and more and more and more and more
More and more, more and more and more than you will ever know
You will never know
You will never know

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Left to right

[Verse]
Niggas gather round, we about to feast
Boy, get your hands off the table, you can have a seat
Blood won’t you talk to your homie, think he in on it?
Hold up, I ain't got nothing to do with it, I put 10 on it
Yea, playboy got the shank, he gon' poke him up, ayy
Don’t be talkin’ behind my back, say that to both of us
Look, middleman chillin', say somebody gon' kill him
What? We been with you since day one, from here to the ceiling
Wait, wait, back, back, both of y’all get out your feelings
Eh, whatchu tryna say? Big man, why you trippin’?
We can’t cross you, you know that’s the Lord, that’s religion
Ain’t no flaw in our mission, why you think somebody snitching?
Yeah, police probably canvassed it but that don’t mean they planned the hit
Cuzzo like, "Who’s man is this?" We running with a pacifist
I see y’all in that corner like y’all plotting on and planning shit
Thought y’all was a fan of this, I put y’all in my manuscripts
Evangelists

[Bridge]
Hey, look at what I gave you, enough bread to go around
I told you I can save you, my head will bear the crown
But you tried to slay me and play me like a clown
I was gonna pick you up, you wanna lay me down

[Chorus]
Last supper, at that last supper
At that last supper
Last supper, man, that last supper
Man, that last supper

[Verse 1]
3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Verse 2]
Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been sleeping later, I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper but the memories won't stop

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Bridge]
I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before it's too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Verse 1]
I see the moon, I see the moon, I see the moon
Oh, when you're looking at the sun
Not a fool, I’m not a fool, not a fool
No, you're not fooling anyone

[Refrain]
Oh, but when you're gone
When you’re gone, when you're gone
Oh baby, all the lights go out
Thinking, oh that, baby, I was wrong
I was wrong, I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out

[Chorus]
Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one

[Verse 2]
I see in blue, I see in blue, I see in blue
Oh, when you see everything in red
There is nothing that I wouldn't do for you
Do for you, do for you
Oh, cause you got inside my head

[Refrain]
Oh, but when you're gone
When you're gone, when you're gone
Oh baby, all the lights go out
Thinking, oh that, baby, I was wrong
I was wrong, I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out

[Chorus]
Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won’t let you down and run
No, I won’t let you down and run
Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one

[Bridge]
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Will you be mine?

[Chorus]
Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won’t let you down and run
Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one

[Verse 1]
Know you're bad for me, but you know I am too
Me and you together, like a loved up bruise
I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse
Baby, you're okay
Baby, you're okay
No, you won't, won't go breaking my heart
You've seen that we got the same pain, same scar
Felt that when we got closer in the dark
Baby, I'm okay
Baby, I'm okay

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, when
When you're far away, I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you

[Chorus]
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

[Verse 2]
Nothing could stop us, we got it all
The love, the passion, but most of all
We mess up, but run from the scene
But I throw my hands up, if you know what I mean
Ah, 'cause I'm not afraid to tell you when you're wrong
And I know that you miss me when I'm gone
We make a great team
With you, I'm badder than I've ever been

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, when
When you're far away, I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you

[Chorus]
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

[Bridge]
Let's be bad, babe
Let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe
Let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe
Let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe

[Chorus]
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

[Verse 1]
All of these highs
And all of these lows
Don't keep me company
I've been breathing you in
And drinking you down
You're the only remedy

[Pre-Chorus]
Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever
Baby, this is all I want

[Chorus]
'Cause all my bones are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Oh, my lungs are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

[Verse 2]
Losing my mind
Dreaming I'll find
Another kind of love
But this blood in my veins
And the thought of your taste
No, I can't give it up
So look at my face
I'm not running away

[Chorus]
'Cause all my bones are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

[Instrumental Break]

[Breakdown]
Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever
Baby, this is all I want
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want

[Chorus]
'Cause all my bones are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Oh, my lungs are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

[Verse 1]
If you see her say hello she might be in Tangier
She left here last early spring, Is living there I hear
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go
She might think that I’ve forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so

[Verse 2]
We had a fallin’ out, like lovers often will
But to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill
And though our separation it pierced me to the heart
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart

[Verse 3]
If you're making love to her, kiss her for the kid
Who always has respected her for doing what she did
Oh, I know it had to be that way, It was written in the cards
Still the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard

[Verse 4]
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
And I hear her name both here and there as I go from town to town
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off
Either I'm too sensitive, or else I'm getting soft

[Verse 5]
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast
If she's passing back this way, I’m not that hard to find
Tell her she can look me up, If she’s got the time

[Verse 1]
Early one morning the sun was shining
And he was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said their lives together
Sure was going to be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And he was standing on the side of the road
Rain falling on his shoes
Heading out for the Old East Coast
Lord knows he's paid some dues
Getting through
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 2]
She was married when they first met
Soon to be divorced
He helped her out of a jam, I guess
But he used a little too much force
And they drove that car as far as they could
Abandoned it out West
And split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
And she turned around to look at him
As he was walking away
She said "This can't be the end
We'll meet on another day, on the avenue"
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 3]
He had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But he never liked it all that much
And one day the ax just fell
So he drifted down to L.A.
Where he reckoned to try his luck
Working for a while in an airplane plant
Loading cargo onto a truck
But all the while he was alone
The past was close behind
He seen a lot of women
But she never escaped his mind
And he just grew
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 4]
She was working in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In the spotlight, so clear
And later on, when the crowd thinned out
I was about to do the same
She was standing there, in back of my chair
Said to me "What's your name?"
I muttered something underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit, I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces
Of my shoes
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 5]
She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
"I thought you'd never say hello" she said
"You look like the silent type"
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pouring off of every page
Like it was written in my soul
From me to you
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 6]
He was always in a hurry
Too busy or too stoned
And everything that she ever planned
Just had to be postponed
He thought they were successful
She thought they were blessed
With objects and material things
But I never was impressed
And when it all came crashing down
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 7]
So now I'm going back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are doctor's wives
Don't know how it all got started
Don't know what they're doing with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
Heading for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point
Of view
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 1]
They sat together in the park
As the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him and he felt a spark, tingle to his bones
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate

[Verse 2]
They walked along by the old canal
A little confused, I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin' bright
He felt the heat of her night, hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate

[Verse 3]
A saxophone someplace far off played
As she was walkin' by the arcade
As the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin' up
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate

[Verse 4]
He woke up, the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside, to which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate

[Verse 5]
He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in
Maybe he'll spot her once again, how long must he wait
One more for a simple twist of fate

[Verse 6]
People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring
She was born in spring, but I was born too late
Blame it on a simple twist of fate

[Verse 1]
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”

[Verse 2]
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word
In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm
“Come in,” she said, “I'll give you shelter from the storm”

[Verse 3]
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place where it’s always safe and warm
“Come in,” she said, “I'll give you shelter from the storm”

[Verse 4]
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes an' blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn
“Come in,” she said, “I'll give you shelter from the storm”

[Verse 5]
Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
“Come in,” she said, “I'll give you shelter from the storm”

[Verse 6]
Now there's a wall between us, somethin' there’s been lost
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”

[Verse 7]
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”

[Verse 8]
Well I've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mournin' dove
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”

[Verse 9]
In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation, she gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn
“Come in,” she said, “I'll give you shelter from the storm”

[Verse 10]
I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born
“Come in,” she said, “I'll give you shelter from the storm”

[Verse 1]
Our conversation was short and sweet
It nearly swept me off-a my feet
And I'm back in the rain, oh
And you are on dry land
Oh, you made it there somehow
You're a big girl now

[Verse 2]
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase
You've known it all the while, I'm learning it these days
Oh, I know where I can find you, oh
In somebody's room
Oh, It's a price I have to pay
You're a big girl all the way

[Verse 3]
Bird on the horizon, sitting on a fence
He's singing his song for me at his own expense
And I'm just like that bird, oh
Singing just for you
Oh, I hope that you can hear
Hear me singing through these tears

[Verse 4]
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
Oh, but what a shame it is that all we've shared can't last
I can change, I swear, oh
See what you can do, oh
I can make it through
You can make it too

[Verse 5]
A change in the weather can be extreme
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream?
I'm going out of my mind, oh
With a pain that stops and starts, oh
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Ever since we've been apart

[Verse 1]
Buckets of rain
Buckets of tears
Got all them buckets comin' out of my ears
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand
You got all the love, honey baby
I can stand

[Verse 2]
I been meek
And hard like an oak
I seen pretty people disappear like smoke
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear
If you want me, honey baby
I’ll be here

[Verse 3]
Little red wagon
Little red bike
I ain't no monkey but I know what I like
I like the way you love me strong and slow
I'm takin’ you with me, honey baby
When I go

[Verse 4]
I like your smile
And your fingertips
Like the way that you move your lips
I like the cool way you look at me
Everything about you is bringing me
Misery

[Verse 5]
Life is sad
Life is a bust
All ya can do is do what you must
You do what you must do and ya do it well
I'll do it for you, honey baby
Can't you tell?

[Verse 1]
The festival was over, the boys were all plannin’ for a fall
The cabaret was quiet except for the drillin’ in the wall
The curfew had been lifted and the gamblin’ wheel shut down
Anyone with any sense had already left town
He was standin’ in the doorway lookin’ like the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 2]
He moved across the mirrored room, “Set it up for everyone,” he said
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doin’ before he turned their heads
Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin
“Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?”
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 3]
Backstage the girls were playin’ five-card stud by the stairs
Lily had two queens, she was hopin’ for a third to match her pair
Outside the streets were fillin’ up, the window was open wide
A gentle breeze was blowin’, you could feel it from inside
Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 4]
Big Jim was no one’s fool, he owned the town’s only diamond mine
He made his usual entrance lookin’ so dandy and so fine
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 5]
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town
She slipped in through the side door lookin’ like a queen without a crown
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear
“Sorry, darlin’, that I’m late,” but he didn’t seem to hear
He was starin’ into space over at the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 6]
“I know I’ve seen that face before,” Big Jim was thinkin’ to himself
“Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody’s shelf”
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the houselights did dim
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him
Starin’ at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 7]
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled
She’d come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere
But she’d never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 8]
The hangin’ judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined
The drillin’ in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind
It was known all around that Lily had Jim’s ring
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king
No, nothin’ ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 9]
Rosemary started drinkin’ hard and seein’ her reflection in the knife
She was tired of the attention, tired of playin’ the role of Big Jim’s wife
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide
Was lookin’ to do just one good deed before she died
She was gazin’ to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 9]
Lily washed her face, took her dress off and buried it away
“Has your luck run out?” she laughed at him, “Well, I guess you must
Have known it would someday
Be careful not to touch the wall, there’s a brand-new coat of paint
I’m glad to see you’re still alive, you’re lookin’ like a saint”
Down the hallway footsteps were comin’ for the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 10]
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair
“There’s something funny going on,” he said, “I can just feel it in the air”
He went to get the hangin’ judge, but the hangin’ judge was drunk
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk
There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 11]
Lily’s arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch
She forgot all about the man she couldn’t stand who hounded her so much
“I’ve missed you so,” she said to him, and he felt she was sincere
But just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear
Just another night in the life of the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 12]
No one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick
The door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked
And Big Jim was standin’ there, ya couldn’t say surprised
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes
She was with Big Jim but she was leanin’ to the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 13]
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
And cleaned out the bank safe, it’s said that they got off with quite a haul
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
For one more member who had business back in town
But they couldn’t go no further without the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 14]
The next day was hangin’ day, the sky was overcast and black
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn’t even blink
The hangin’ judge was sober, he hadn’t had a drink
The only person on the scene missin’ was the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 15]
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said, “Closed for repair”
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair
She was thinkin’ ’bout her father, who she very rarely saw
Thinkin’ ’bout Rosemary and thinkin’ about the law
But most of all she was thinkin’ ’bout the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 1]
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha
Honey, we could be in Kansas
By time the snow begins to thaw

[Verse 2]
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
But you wouldn’t know it by me
Every day’s been darkness since you been gone

[Verse 3]
Little rooster crowin’, there must be something on his mind
Little rooster crowin’, there must be something on his mind
Well, I feel just like that rooster
Honey, ya treat me so unkind

[Verse 4]
The birds are flyin’ low babe, honey I feel so exposed
Well, the birds are flyin’ low babe, honey I feel so exposed
Well now, I ain’t got any matches
And the station doors are closed

[Verse 5]
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above
Well, you know I even outran the hound dogs
Honey, you know I’ve earned your love

[Verse 6]
Look at the sun sinkin’ like a ship
Look at the sun sinkin’ like a ship
Ain’t that just like my heart, babe
When you kissed my lips?

[Verse 1]
Someone’s got it in for me, they’re planting stories in the press
Whoever it is I wish they’d cut it, but when they will I can only guess
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me
I can’t help it if I’m lucky

[Verse 2]
People see me all the time and they just can’t remember how to act
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts
Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at
I couldn’t believe after all these years, you didn’t know me any better than that
Sweet lady

[Chorus]
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth
Going down the backroads heading south
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
You’re an idiot, babe
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe

[Verse 3]
I threw the I-Ching yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the well
I haven't tasted peace and quiet, for so long it seems like living hell
There’s a lone soldier on the hill, watching falling raindrops pour
You'd never know it to look at him, at the final shot he won the war
After losing every battle

[Verse 4]
I woke up on the roadside, daydreaming about the way things sometimes are
Hoofbeats pounding in my head, at break-neck speed and making me see stars
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies
One day you’ll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes
Blood on your saddle

[Chorus]
Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb
Blowing through the curtains in your room
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
You’re an idiot, babe
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe

[Verse 5]
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart
You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn’t enough to change my heart
Now everything’s a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped
What’s good is bad, what’s bad is good, you’ll find out when you reach the top
You’re on the bottom

[Verse 6]
I noticed at the ceremony, that you left your bags behind
The driver came in after you left, he gave them all to me, and then he resigned
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned
You didn't trust me for a minute babe, I've never known the Spring to turn so quickly into Autumn

[Chorus]
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your jaw
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
You’re an idiot, babe
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe

[Verse 7]
We pushed each other a little too far, and one day it just turned into a raging storm
The hound dog bayed beyond your trees, as I was packing up my uniform
Well, I figured I’d lost you anyway, why go on? What’s the use?
In order to get in a word with you
I’d have had to come up with some kind of excuse
And it just struck me kind of funny

[Verse 8]
I've been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind
Ladykillers load dice on me, behind my back, while imitators steal me blind
You close your eyes and pout your lips and slip your fingers from your glove
You can have the best there is but it's going to cost you all your love
You won't get it for money

[Chorus]
Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats
Blowing through the letters that we wrote
Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves
We’re idiots, babe
It’s a wonder we can even feed ourselves

[Verse 1]
I’ve seen love go by my door
It’s never been this close before
Never been so easy or so slow
I've been shooting in the dark too long
When something’s not right, it’s wrong
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Verse 2]
Dragon clouds so high above
I’ve only known careless love
It always just hit me from below
But this time 'round it’s more correct
Right on target, so direct
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Verse 3]
Purple clover, Queen Anne Lace
Crimson hair across your face
You could make me cry, if you don’t know
Can’t remember what I was thinking of
You might be spoilin’ me too much, love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Bridge 1]
Flowers on the hillside, bloomin’ crazy
Crickets talkin’ back and forth in rhyme
Blue river runnin’ slow and lazy
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time

[Verse 4]
Situations have ended sad
Relationships have all been bad
Mine’ve been like Verlaine’s and Rimbaud
But there’s no way I can compare
All them scenes to this affair
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Bridge 2]
You're gonna make me wonder what I’m doin’
Staying far behind without you
You're gonna make me wonder what I’m sayin’
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to

[Verse 5]
I’ll look for you in old Honolulu
San Francisco or Ashtabula
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know
But I’ll see you in the sky above
In the tall grass, in the ones I love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Verse 1]
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy
I know you’re long gone, I guess it must be up to me

[Verse 2]
If I'd thought about it I never would've done it, I guess I would’ve let it slide
If I'd have paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me would've died
I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me

[Verse 3]
Well, the Union Central is pulling out and the orchids are in bloom
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it must be up to me

[Verse 4]
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch
I'd just about convinced myself that nothing had changed that much
The old Rounder in the iron mask slipped me the master key
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me

[Verse 5]
Well, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers’ club
I would’ve followed you in the door but I didn't have a ticket stub
So I waited all night ’til the break of day, hoping one of us could get free
When the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me

[Verse 6]
Well, the only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work
Was I a fool or not to try to protect your identity?
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me

[Verse 7]
Well, I met somebody face to face and I had to remove my hat
She's everything I need and love but I can't be swayed by that
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be
But she ain't a-going to make me move, I guess it must be up to me

[Verse 8]
We heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex
It didn’t amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects
When you bite off more than you can chew you pay the penalty
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me

[Verse 9]
Well, Dupree came in pimpin' tonight to the Thunderbird Café
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way
Well, I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company
But you ain't a-going to cross the line, I guess it must be up to me

[Verse 10]
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's really nothing much to tell
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is history
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me

[Verse 11]
So go on, boys, and play your hands, life is a pantomime
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me

[Verse 12]
And if we never meet again, baby, remember me
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you, free
No one else could play that tune, you know it was up to me
I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody

I can manipulate people as well as anybody
Bust ‘em and burn ‘em, twist ‘em and turn ‘em
I can make believe I’m in love with anybody
Hold ‘em and control ‘em, squeeze ‘em and tease ‘em
But I know it satisfies the flesh that it feeds
I’ve been down that road, I know what it leads

But I ain’t gonna go to hell for anybody
I ain’t gonna go to hell for anybody
I ain’t gonna go to hell for anybody
Not today, not tonight, not tomorrow, no never, no way!

I can twist the truth as well as anybody
Wine ‘em and dine ‘em, find ‘em and blind ‘em
I can mislead people as well as anybody
I got the vision to cause any kind of division
But I know that (?) control
To gain the whole world but give up my soul
But I ain’t gonna go to hell for anybody
I ain’t gonna go to hell for anybody
I ain’t gonna go to hell for anybody
Not for father, not for mother, not for sister, not for father, no way!

Smoke arises for ever, on a one-way ticket to burn
A place reserved for the devil
And for all those that love evil
A place of darkness and shade, you can never return

I can rob and steal from people as well as anybody
I know how to do it, I can see through it
I can influence people as well as anybody
I know what to tell 'em, I can why 'em(?) or well 'em(?)
The lawman won't get me with his tricks or his cards
I can see through man’s delusions, I see through his facades

But I ain’t gonna go to hell for anybody
I ain’t gonna go to hell for anybody
I ain’t gonna go to hell for anybody
Not for father, not for mother, not for sister, not for father, no way!

I can manipulate people as well as anybody
Bust ‘em and burn ‘em, twist ‘em and turn ‘em
I can make believe I’m in love with almost anybody
Hold ‘em and control ‘em, squeeze ‘em and tease ‘em
But it don’t suit my purposes and it ain’t my goal
To gain the whole world, but give up my soul
But I ain’t gonna go to hell for anybody
I ain’t gonna go to hell for anybody
I ain’t gonna go to hell for anybody
Not for father, not for mother, not for sister, not for father, no way!
When a man he serves the Lord, it makes his life worthwhile
It don't matter 'bout his position, it don't matter 'bout his lifestyle
Talk about perfection, I ain't never seen none
And there ain't no man righteous, no not one

Sometimes the devil likes to drive you from the neighborhood
He'll even work his ways through those whose intentions are good
Some like to worship on the moon, others are worshipping the sun
And there ain't no man righteous, no not one

Look around, ya see so many social hypocrites
Like to make rules for others while they do just the opposite

You can't get to glory by the raising and the lowering of no flag
Put your goodness next to God's and it comes out like a filthy rag
In a city of darkness there's no need of the sun
And there ain't no man righteous, no not one

Done so many evil things in the name of love that it's a crying shame
I never did see no fire that could put out a flame
Pull your hat down, baby, pull the wool down over your eyes
Keep a-talking, baby, 'til you run right out of alibis
Someday you'll account for all the deeds that you done
Well, there ain't no man righteous, no not one

God got the power, man has got his vanity
Man gotta choose before God can set him free
Don't you know there's nothing new that's under the sun?
Well, there ain't no man righteous, no not one

When I'm gone don't wonder where I be
Just say that I trusted in God and that Christ was in me
Say He defeated the devil, He was God's chosen Son
And that there ain't no man righteous, no not one
Blessed is the name of the Lord forever
Wisdom and might are his
Blessed is the name of the Lord forever
Wisdom and might are his
Are his, are his

Blessed is the name of the Lord forever
Wisdom and might are his
Blessed is the name of the Lord forever
Wisdom and might are his

When he move his face upon the water
Sit up high on the throne
Like him there is no other
He's God all by himself alone

Blessed is the name of the Lord forever
Wisdom and might are his
Blessed is the name of the Lord forever
Wisdom and might are his
Are his, oh Lord, are his
Blessed is the name of the Lord forever
Wisdom and might are his
Blessed is the name of the Lord forever
Wisdom and might are his

Well back down in the days of Noah
He'd drown you right out of town
But he did not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah
Till Lot was safely out of the town

Blessed is the name of the Lord forever
Wisdom and might are his
Blessed is the name of the Lord forever
Wisdom and might are his
Are his, oh Lord, are his

Blessed is the name of the Lord forever
Wisdom and might are his
Blessed is the name of the Lord forever
Wisdom and might are his

(Guitar Solo)

Well you read about him everyday
But on his had got his own time clock
He will not share his glory
And he will not be mocked
Blessed is the name of the Lord forever
Wisdom and might are his
Blessed is the name of the Lord forever
Wisdom and might are his
Are his, oh Lord, are his

Blessed is the name of the Lord forever
Wisdom and might are his
Blessed is the name of the Lord forever
Wisdom and might are his

[Verse]
There are so many times when I just need a hug
When I need way more than a listening ear of a friend
Being in hospital after I was raped, and I had no one
No one to call, beaten and robbed, beaten on the streets
And have no one to even ask me if I’m okay after
Being homeless, to being diagnosed with HIV
Not even being able to sleep at night
I can’t sleep at night
Birthdays, Christmas, you see, I chose to be here
I chose to understand the strength
And there’s so much beauty in that
There’s so much beauty in that
You see, it’s not who you are, or what we are
But it’s the journey, and for me
It’s always been about the journey
This body, my blackness and my transness
Seems to be a beacon of violence
Just in existence alone
I gave up everything, just to exist
To be honest, I wouldn’t have it any other way
There’s so much beauty in that
And that’s just unquantifiable

[Verse 1]
I don't need my stocking filled with toys
And I don't need no gifts to bring me joy
Baby, I-I haven't hung my mistletoe
'Cause without you, baby, I can't see no point

[Chorus]
Baby I hope Santa brings you to me
'Cause it's all I wished for this Christmas Eve
No, I don't want much, your love is all I need
Baby, I hope Santa brings you to me

[Refrain]
Hope he's bringing me love this Christmas (Love this Christmas)
'Cause I deserve you here (Deserve you here)
Bring me love this Christmas (Love this Christmas)
'Cause I've been good this year
Hope he's bringing me love this Christmas (Love this Christmas)
'Cause I deserve you here (Deserve you here)
Bring me love this Christmas (Love this Christmas)
'Cause I've been good this year

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna light this tree alone (No, no, I can't)
I can't sing Christmas songs if you're not home
No, I-I haven't hung my mistletoe
'Cause without you, baby, I can't see no point

[Chorus]
Baby, I hope Santa brings you to me
'Cause it's all I wished for this Christmas Eve
No, I don't want much, your love is all I need
Baby, I hope Santa brings you to me

[Refrain]
Hope he's bringing me love this Christmas (Love this Christmas)
'Cause I deserve you here (Deserve you here)
Bring me love this Christmas (Love this Christmas)
'Cause I've been good this year

[Verse 3]
It's been so cold since you've been gone (Been gone)
This winter seems so long (So long)
And I can't get in no spirit
It feels so wrong

[Bridge]
Bring me love this Christmas
'Cause I deserve you here
Bring me love this Christmas
'Cause I've been good this year

[Refrain]
Hope he's bringing me love (Love this Christmas)

[Outro]
Hey (Love this Christmas)
Would you bring me love (Deserve you here)
(Love this Christmas) yeah, yeah
(Good this year)
(Love this Christmas) It's the only thing I need baby (Deserve you here)
(Love this Christmas) yeah
Ho, ho, ho, ah
Yeahhh

[Verse 1]
All the trees alight, all the holly streaming
The town has come to life, waiting for Christmas
I still feel low, searching for some meaning
Until you come home, I'm waiting for Christmas with you

[Verse 2]
Christmas without you, a long, dark shade of blue
I feel like I've been waiting here forever
All the gifts arrive, all the children singing
Gathered 'round the fire, waiting for Christmas
I could sing along, but I can't find the meaning
The melody feels wrong, I'm waiting for Christmas with you

[Verse 3]
Oh, when I see your face on this Christmas day
I'll know the light of love brought us together
But until that hour, my eyes will be wide open
I'm like a little child, waiting for Christmas
When that morning comes, we can count our blessings
It was worth it all along, waiting for Christmas with you

[Verse 1]
Ah yeah
Candles burning low, lots of mistletoe
Lots of snow and ice everywhere we go
Choirs singing carols right outside my door

[Chorus]
All these things and more (All these things and more, my baby)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
Ah yeah

[Verse 2]
And ya know what I mean
I see your smiling face like I've never seen before
Even though I love ya madly, it seems I love you more
And the little thoughts you give me touch my heart for sure

[Chorus]
Oh, all these things and more
(All these things and more, my darling)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
Ah yeah

[Bridge]
I feel like running wild, I feel just like a little child
Bring you 'neath the mistletoe
I kiss you once, and then some more
Wish you a merry Christmas, baby
(Wish you a merry Christmas, baby)
And such happiness in the coming year, oh
(Happiness in the coming year)
Let's deck the halls with holly, singing "Silent Night"
Dress the trees with angel hair, and pretty, pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up just before daylight

[Chorus]
Oh, all these things and more, darling
(All these things and more, my darling)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
Oh yeah, yeah
Silver, (Silver bells) silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city, oh
Ring-a-ling, (Ring-a-ling) hear them ring (Hear them ring)
Soon it will be Christmas day

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas

Children laughing
People passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear

Oh they're playing
Silver bells, silver bells (Silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city (La la la la la la)
Ring-a-ling, (Ring-a-ling) hear them ring (Hear them ring)

Blinking bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures, yeah
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big day
And above all the bustle you hear

Oh they're playing
Silver bells, silver bells (Silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city (La la la la la la)
Ring-a-ling, (Ring-a-ling) hear them ring (Hear them ring)
Soon it will be Christmas day, ah

Soon we will come together
We'll learn to love each other
Just like those silver bells playing
And people around the word can dance to the sound
Of Christmas day

Silver bells, silver bells (Silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city (La la la la la la)
Ring-a-ling, (Ring-a-ling) hear them ring (Hear them ring)
Soon it will be Christmas, come on now

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on
Our troubles will be out of sight, oh

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yule-tide gay
From now on
Our troubles will be miles away

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years
We all will be together
If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself A merry little Christmas now, oh
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore

[Verse 1]
Baby, I can't wait for late December
The smell of cinnamon and pine
But we'll be taking out the Christmas timber
And hanging up the fairy lights
We can have a party, you can sing the carols
We're not going out at all
I got everything I need right here
There's no one else I need to call

[Chorus]
'Cause there's no, no place like home at Christmastime
Let the snow fall down (Snow falling down)
We're snuggled up inside
We got love with us, it's a good Christmas
'Cause there's no, no place like home at Christmastime

[Post-Chorus]
La la la, la la la la
La la la, la la la la

[Verse 2]
Cozy up right by the fireplace and watch our favorite movies play
Cooking up a feast for kings and queens
Our castle is our sacred place
And we can have a party, dancing to the carols
We're not going out at all
I got everything I need right here
I know we're gonna have a ball

[Chorus]
'Cause there's no, no place like home at Christmastime
Let the snow fall down (Snow falling down)
We're snuggled up inside
We got love with us, it's a good Christmas
'Cause there's no, no place like home at Christmastime

[Bridge]
Make a Christmas vow (Make a Christmas vow)
All we need is now (All we need is now)
All we have is us, we're more than enough
Now we made this house a home
A beautiful world of our own
Do this every year, we're not leaving here

[Chorus]
'Cause there's no, no place like home at Christmastime
Let the snow fall down (Snow falling down)
We're snuggled up inside
We got love with us, it's a good Christmas
'Cause there's no, no place like home at Christmastime

[Outro]
Oh, no place like home at Christmastime
Yeah, no place like home at Christmastime
Sing it with me, y'all, come on
Hey, no place like home at Christmastime
No place like home at Christmastime
Oh baby, feels good to be home

About a half past three
He left these pretty presents
That you see before me

Give love on Christmas day
Even the man who has everything
Would be so happy if you would bring
Give love on Christmas day
There's no greater gift than love, love, love
Merry Christmas baby
Softly they fall, where do they go?

(Purple snowflakes)
Cover the ground, without a sound
(Gentle snowflakes)
Fall from the sky, before your eyes
(It's so thrilling)
Blankets of white, brighten the night
(Such a feeling)
They seem to say, that our love is here to stay
We'll be cozy and warm until summer flowers bloom

Here in our midst, we're surely blessed
(Chestnuts roasting)
Over the heat, gee ain't life sweet?
(Tootsies toasting)
Drifting on air, without a care
(Purple snowflakes)
Cover the ground, without a sound
(Love the snowflakes)
I'm sure that snowflakes, fall from the gloom
I will always remember this night here with you
Yeah, the snowflakes, pretty purple snowflakes
Snowflakes, pretty purple snowflakes
Here in our midst, we're surely blessed
(Chestnuts roasting)
Over the heat, gee ain't life sweet?
(Tootsies toasting)
Drifting on air, without a care
(Purple snowflakes)
Cover the ground, without a sound
(Lovely snowflakes)
I'm sure that snowflakes, fall from the gloom
I will always remember this night here with you
Yeah I say snowflakes, pretty purple snowflakes
Pretty purple snowflakes, snowflakes, pretty purple snowflakes
I got you here in my arms
All through the year we've waited
Waited through spring and fall
To hear silver bells ringing
And winter time bringing the happiest season of all

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos, oh

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times
Many ways, merry Christmas to you
And so we're offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times
Many ways, merry Christmas merry Christmas, merry Christmas to you
Bells will be ringing the glad glad news
Oh what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again

Choirs will be singing "Silent Night"
Oh, Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas

If not for Christmas by New Years night
Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
Oh this is Christmas, yes, Christmas my dear

The time of year to be with the ones you love
Then won't you tell me you'll never more roam?
Christmas and New Years will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief, no pain

Because I'll be happy, happy once again
Oh there'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, Christmas once again
Mmm, yeah, ah, ah, yeah
No more sorrow, no grief, no pain
Because it's Christmas, Christmas once again

The time of the year to be with the one you love
Then won't you tell me you'll never more roam?

There'll be no more sorrow, no grief, no pain
Because it's Christmas, Christmas once again

[Intro]
Wrap me up in your love, wrap me up in your love
Wrap me up in your love this Christmas
Wrap me up in your love

[Verse 1]
Let's enjoy the holiday, be here and now, this time and place
Laughter while the children play
These memories, they'll never fade
Let them open every gift, and while they do, we'll sneak a kiss
And, baby, when the day is through, my only gift is you

[Chorus 1]
Wrap me up in your love this Christmas
Wrap me up in your love
You've been at the top of my wish list
Hoping I've been good enough

Oh, you know just what I want, yeah
(Both giving, both receiving)
So wrap me up in your love

[Verse 2]
Ayy, we don't need no mistletoe
I'll kiss you, love, everywhere you go
There's nothing left here but the tree
The fireplace, and you and me
We'll pour another glass of wine
It's almost midnight, this is our time
And we won't even feel the cold, we can let it snow

[Chorus 2]
Wrap me up in your love this Christmas, wrap me up in your love
You've been at the top of my wish list

I'm a thousand miles away, it's not snowing in LA
But I'm falling just the same, I'm sorry
All the flights have been delayed, I've got nowhere to stay
But if I can find my way, I'll hurry

[Pre-Chorus]
Just hang up the Christmas lights, and I'll do the rest tonight
Just tell the kids I'm coming, I swear that I'll be running
And under the Christmas tree, together, yeah, we will be
I promise

[Chorus]
I'm gonna walk, if I have to run
I'll stand on the highway and stop someone
I'll cross the deserts and oceans, a river that's frozen
I'll follow the stars just to find where you are
You can count on me
Make a wish, close your eyes, and believe
I'll be home, home, home, home, home by Christmas Eve

[Verse 2]
And I know it's all on you, keep it together like you're glue
And everything you do, I notice
So I'll bring presents, I'll bring wine
The mistletoe for you and I
And I'll be there just in time to show it

[Pre-Chorus]
Just hang up the Christmas lights, and I'll do the rest tonight
And tell the kids I'm coming, I swear that I'll be running
Under the Christmas tree, together, yeah, we will be
I promise

[Chorus]
I'm gonna walk, if I have to run
I'll stand on the highway and stop someone
I'll cross the deserts and oceans, a river that's frozen
I'll follow the stars just to find where you are
You can count on me
Make a wish, close your eyes, and believe
I'll be home, home, home, home, home by Christmas Eve

[Bridge]
Whoa, I'll find my way back to California
I'll follow the map, yeah, somewhere warmer
I'll carry my bags just until I can hold you again

[Chorus]
I'm gonna walk, if I have to run
I'll stand on the highway and stop someone
I'll cross the deserts and oceans, a river that's frozen
I'll follow the stars just to find where you are
You can count on me
Make a wish, close your eyes, and believe
I'll be home, home, home, home, home by Christmas Eve

[Intro]
Ever you ready, brother unite us
Ever you been bad, all the united

[Pre-Chorus]
Woo, Christmas time with you
I made a little list of my favorite things to do
I count one, two, three four, up to ten
From the beginning until the end
Celebrating merry, merry Christmas time with you

[Chorus]
So have a merry, merry Christmas (Have a merry, merry Christmas)
Have a merry, merry Christmas (Have a merry, merry Christmas)
Have a merry, merry Christmas (Have a merry, merry Christmas)
'Cause I spent it with you
So have a merry, merry Christmas (Have a merry, merry Christmas)
Have a merry, merry Christmas (Have a merry, merry Christmas)
Have a merry, merry Christmas (Have a merry, merry Christmas)
'Cause I spent it with you

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Woo, Christmas time with you
I made a little list of my favorite things to do
I count one, two, three four, up to ten
From the beginning until the end
Celebrating merry, merry Christmas time with you

[Chorus]
So have a merry, merry Christmas (Have a merry, merry Christmas)
Have a merry, merry Christmas (Have a merry, merry Christmas)
Have a merry, merry Christmas (Have a merry, merry Christmas)
'Cause I spent it with you
So have a merry, merry Christmas (Have a merry, merry Christmas)
Have a merry, merry Christmas (Have a merry, merry Christmas)
Have a merry, merry Christmas (Have a merry, merry Christmas)
'Cause I spent it with you

[Outro]
Hey
Sometimes you just need to be with the one you love
Christmas just ain't Christmas without the ones you love
That's what we used to say, woo
'Cause I spent it with you
Hey, hey
You ain't sweatin', you ain't doin' it right
Try love, try love, try love. You see, they’re laughing at me. You heard ’em? They scream at me. They bully me. They bullied me backstage, they said, Don’t go out there with that hat on.
They bullied me backstage. They bullied me! And then they say I’m in a sunken place.
You wanna see the sunken place?
Ok, I’m gonna listen to y’all now.
Or I’m gonna put my superman cape on.
And this means you can’t tell me what to do.
Follow your heart and stop following your mind. That’s how we’re controlled. That’s how we’re programmed.
If you want the world to move forward, try love.
Thank y’all for giving me this platform.
I know some of y’all don’t agree. But y’all be going at that man’s neck a lot, and I don’t think it’s actually that helpful.
I think the universe has balance.
90% of news are liberal.
90% of TV, L.A., New York, writers, rappers, musicians.
So it’s easy to make it seem like it’s so, so, so one-sided. And uh… I am kinda free.
I thought this country said I could be me.
(I love you Kanye)
I love me too.
And I love ya’ll too – so bring the band back!
Bring the band back.
When you feel that, you’ll understand that.
Wave your motherfucking hands up!
I feel good.

Thirteen celebs who have issues with Taylor Swift
I felt like she was a little angry
Number thirteen
There she is leaving a restaurant
She holds too many grudges
Why did Taylor Swift-
You can see her feet at the very bottom, and can see her making her way into the car
I can understand trying to keep your relationship to yourself at the beginning, or needing to take some time to work on your craft
But come on!
And Taylor, voluntarily bringing attention to herself of her donations
What Swift did is not enough
Yeah, okay Tay, Whatever you say
I, I hate to say this, but I think Taylor Swift is learning a few lessons in life
All this drama is exhausting
Taylor Swift should focus on making the rest of reputation
Reputation
What it is-

Taylor Swifts new romance is heating up

[Chorus 1: Style]
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

[Verse 1: Style]
Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you (Heard from you)

[Pre-Chorus 1: Style]
And I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch it go round and round each time

[Chorus 1: Style]
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

[Spoken]
Dallas, will you, please, make some noise for my incredible band?

[Verse 2: Love Story]
We were both young when I first saw you
Close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello", little did I know?

[Pre-Chorus 2: Love Story]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, please, don't go
And I said

[Chorus 2: Love Story]
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"

[Bridge 1: Love Story]
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, I said

[Breakdown: Love Story]
"Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

[Chorus 3: Love Story]
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"

[Bridge 2: You Belong With Me]
Oh, I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

[Chorus 4: You Belong With Me]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along so why can't you see?
You belong with me, yeah
Let me see you jump!
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me

[Outro: You Belong With Me]
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me

One voice, one hope, one real decision

No wrong, no right
I'm gonna tell you there’s no black and no white
No blood, no stain
All we need is one worldwide vision

One flesh, one bone, one true religion
One voice, one hope, one real decision
Whoa-ooh-whoa-ooh-whoa-ooh-whoa-ooh-whoa-ooh
Whoa-yeah, whoa-yeah, whoa-yeah!

[Bridge]
I had a dream when I was young
A dream of sweet illusion
A glimpse of hope and unity
Visions of one sweet union
(But a cold wind blows)
(And a dark rain falls)
And in my heart, it shows
Look what they've done to my dream (Yeah!)

[Verse 3]
One vision!
Give me your hands
Give me your hearts
I'm ready!
There’s only one direction
One world and one nation
Yeah, one vision

My little school babe
Your momma says you don't
And your daddy says you won't
And I'm boiling up inside
No way! (I'm going to lose out this time)

[Chorus]
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Lock your daddy out of doors

[Intro: Freddie Mercury & Audience]
Hello!
(Hello!)
This is what you wanted, this is what you're gonna get!

[Verse 1]
Fear me you lords and lady preachers
I descend upon your earth from the skies
I command your very souls you unbelievers
Bring before me what is mine
The seven seas of Rhye
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Can you hear me you peers and privy counselors
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust
The faulty what is mine
The seven seas of Rhye

[Bridge/Outro]
Sister, I live and lie for you
Mister, do and I’ll die
You are mine I possess you
I belong to you forever
(Ever, ever)

[Intro]
It's a kind of magic
A kind of magic

[Verse 1]
One dream, one soul, one prize
One goal, one golden glance of what should be
(It's a kind of magic)
One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day
(It's a kind of magic)
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity
Is this a kind of magic?
(It's a kind of magic)
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done
This flame that burns inside of me
I'm hearing secret harmonies
It's a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
I told ya!

[Guitar Solo 1]

Everybody Hey!
Hey!

[Chorus]
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be, will soon be, will soon be done
This is (this is) a kind (a kind) of magic (yeah)
There can be only one one one one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done
Done

[Instrumental Interlude]

Hey!
Everybody!
Magic magic magic (magic)

[Guitar Solo 2]

[Chorus]
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be, will soon be, will soon be done
Will soon be done
Yeah!

[Song Intro: Freddie Mercury]
This is "Under Pressure"

[Applause]

[Intro: Freddie Mercury]
Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh

[Verse 1]
Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

[Bridge]
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da
That's okay

[Chorus]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, 'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

[Verse 2: David Bowie & Freddie Mercury]
Day day de mm hm
Da da da ba ba
Okay
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
Ee do ba be
Ee da ba ba ba
Um bo bo
De Dap
People on streets
Ee da de da de
People on streets
Ee da de da de da de da

[Chorus]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, 'Let me out'
High, Higher, High

[Bridge]
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why?
Why?
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

[Verse 3]
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

[Outro]
Because love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure

[Applause]

[Intro: Freddie Mercury]
Okay!
This next song calls for a boobie, I mean...
So...

[Crowd Applause]
Another one bites the dust!
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

[Chorus: Freddie Mercury & Crowd]
Sing it!
(Another one bites the dust)
Thank you! And again?
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
Told you I was gonna get ya!

[Verse 2]
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Hey-hey-hey-hey

[Chorus: Freddie Mercury & Crowd]
Hey-hey-hey-hey
(Another one bites the dust)
And... do it for me!
(Another one bites the dust)
Hey!

Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad
And leave him when he's down, yeah
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating the sound of the beat

[Chorus: Freddie Mercury & Crowd]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Another one bites the dust
(Another one bites the dust)
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too

[Crowd Applause]

[Verse 1: Freddie Mercury & Crowd]
(I want to break free)
(I want to break free)
I want to break free from your lies
You are so self-satisfied I don't need you
I want to break free, hey!
(God knows)
God knows I want to break free

[Verse 2]
I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love for the first time
And this time I know it's for real
I've fallen in love, yeah
God knows, God knows I've fallen in love

[Bridge]
It's strange but it's true, yeah
I can't get over the way you love me like you do
But I have to be sure
When I walk out that door
Oh how I want to be free, baby
Oh how I want to be free
Oh how I want to break free

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
But life still goes on
I can't get used to living without, living without
Living without you by my side
I don't want to live alone, hey
God knows, got to make it on my own
So baby can't you see, yeah?
God knows I want to
God knows I want to
God knows I want to break free

[Crowd Applause]

[Applause]

[Verse 1]
Just think of all those hungry mouths we have to feed
Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need

[Chorus]
Is this the world we created
We made it on our own
Is this the world we devasted
Right to the bone
If there is a God in the sky looking down
What can he think of what we've done
To the world that He created

[Applause]

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Verse 3]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

[Guitar Solo 2]

[Outro: Freddie Mercury & Crowd]
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
(Nothing really matters to me)
Nothing really matters to me

[Audience Cheering]

Any way the wind blows

[Audience Applause]

[Intro]
Hammer to fall!
Hey!

[Verse 1]
Here we stand or here we fall
History don't care at all
Make the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight

[Chorus]
You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
We are just waiting
For the hammer to fall

[Verse 2]
Oh every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
Lift your face, the Western way, baby
Build your muscles as your body decays

[Chorus]
Tow the line and play their game
Let the anesthetic cover it all
Until one day they call your name
When it's time for the hammer to fall

[Bridge]
Rich or poor or famous for
Your truth is all the same (oh no, oh no)
Lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane (oh no)
Baby now your struggle's all in vain

[Guitar Solo 1]

Whoa-oah

[Verse 4]
For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just want to scream it louder and louder

[Chorus]
What the hell are we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
You just got time to say your prayers
Then it's time for the hammer to, hammer to fall
Fall

[Guitar Solo 2]

Hey, hey
Hey, hey

[Outro]
Ha!
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah!
Waiting for the hammer to, hammer to
Hammer to fall

Give it to me one more time!

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio

You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made them laugh, you made them cry
You made us feel like we could fly (radio)

So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

[Chorus]
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you!

[Verse 2]
We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years (radio)

Let's hope you never leave old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

[Chorus]
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, Someone still loves you

[Outro]
Loves you

[Audience Applause]

[Audience Cheering]

[Verse 1]
Buddy, you’re a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday
Mud on your face, you big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place
Sing it!

[Chorus: Freddie Mercury & Crowd]
(We will, we will rock you) Yeah
(We will, we will rock you)
We will, we will rock you, one more time!
We will, we will rock you

[Guitar Solo]

[Audience Cheering]

[Verse 1]
Now it's a beautiful day
The postman delivered a letter from your lover
Only a phone call away
You tried to track him down but somebody stole his number
As a matter of fact
You're getting used to life without him in your way

[Chorus: Freddie Mercury & (Crowd)]
It's not easy love, but you've got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand
Friends will be friends
(Right 'til the end)

[Audience Applause]

[Audience Cheering]

[Verse 1]
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through
(On and on, and on, and on)

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
Oh we are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Audience Applauds]

[Intro: Freddie Mercury]

[Audience Cheering]
Thank you beautiful people!
You've been a tremendous-
You've been a really special audience
Thank you very much
Good night
Sweet dreams
We love you

[Audience Applause]

[Crowd sings "United Kingdom National Anthem"]
Send her victorious
Happy and glorious
Long to reign over us
God save the Queen

[Audience Applause]

[Robotic voice #1]
Hi Andrew and Ben. This is Matthew Dear
Hi Matthew
I want to remix your album
OK, go ahead

[Robotic voice #2]
Pause for response

I said, are you ready, to, continue, having a good time?
Pause for response

Excellent. I was hoping you would say that

[Robotic voice #1]
Seriously, can you imagine where this intro would be if you had answered otherwise?

[Robotic voice #2]
While I may sound present, I am in fact not. I am not here. I am a distant glitch, in a browser. Just a bunch of zeroes and ones

[Robotic voice #1]
Wow. Pause for sadness
This introduction has gone completely sideways. I guess I will let you get back to the dancing

[Robotic voice #2]
Prepare to hear some really really really really really really really really really really really really good music. And remember, as always, no photos, dancing, requests, autographs, dancing, requests, trainspotting, talking, laughing, coughing, sneezing, excessive looking, 

[Extremely loud noise]-ing, proliferating, chafing, incubating, meditating, commentating...

[Robotic voice #1]
Wager waging at. 

[?] Ooh, clapping. Okay, awesome. Here we go

[Woman's Voice]
Get ready to have some fun!
Alright, here we go!
Five, four, three, two, and one
Are you ready to work out?

[Verse 1]
Don't take it the wrong way
I can never keep up
Sick of liking your selfies
Should've gone with my gut
Maybe I'm in a movie
Maybe I'm out to lunch
But I'm constantly swiping it and tapping
It's never relaxing, I need a new routine

[Chorus]
(He's trying)
(She works out too much)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out
(He's trying)
(She works out too much)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out enough
(He's trying)

[Woman's Voice]
Let's move on to the next step

[Robotic voice #2]
No, I do not want to work out. Really, you are working out a lot. More than anyone I know. This probably isn't going to work out
You work out, too much

[Verse 2]
Welcome to the shitshow
Grab a comfortable seat
Find me in the front row
Facing the music, anyone can see

[Chorus]
(He's trying)
(She works out too much)
(She works out too much I know)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out

[Robotic little girl voice]
Hi Andrew and Ben. This is Matthew Dear

[Robotic woman voice]
Hi Matthew

[Robotic little girl voice]
I want to remix your album

[Robotic woman voice]
OK, go ahead

[Verse 1]
I'm not that nice
(you’re nice)
I'm mean and I'm evil
Don’t call me nice
(you're nice)
I'm gonna eat your heart out
I've got some work to do
Baby, I'm ready, I'm ready, ready, ready to blow my lid off

Look out
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Go fuck yourself
You heard me right
Don't call me nice again
Don't you have somewhere to be at 7:30?
Baby, I’m ready, I’m ready, ready, ready to blow my brains out

[Chorus 1]
You die
And words don't do anything
It’s permanently night
And I won't feel anything
We'll all be laughing with you when you die

[Chorus 2]
Words don't do anything
It’s permanently night
And I won't feel anything
We'll all be laughing with you when you die

[Verse 3]
Go fuck yourself
I'm mean, not nice
You said it twice
You said it twice
Don't you have somewhere to be at 7:30?

[Interlude]
I've got some work to do
I'm gonna eat your heart out
I heard you the first time

[Verse 1]
Not everyone can be like me and Michael
The only problem is forgetting which side you're on
So you think the burning light will reappear on summer nights
Like all the rest, but they can't find out

[Verse 2]
In every scene, it's me and Michael
Imaginary bombs, raining down from the clouds
So it seems, the danger signs will never let the feelings die
When all the best and brightest have gone

[Chorus]
Me and Michael
Solid as they come
Me and Michael
It's not a question now
Me and Michael
Solid as they come
Me and Michael
It's not a question now
Me and Michael

[Verse 3]
Binary stars sink, like the setting sun
Too happy with ourselves to notice when the change had come
So you think the losing side would never break dividing lines
But sanctity wasn't in doubt

[Chorus]
Me and Michael
Solid as they come
Me and Michael
It's not a question now
It's me and Michael
Solid as they come
Me and Michael
It's not a question now
Me and Michael

[Spoken Intro]
Here we are, at the apex of the dilemma. And to think, this little gadget, which you all dreamed of having as a child is now causing so much grief. It's like getting that one and only childhood gift you always wanted. The eternal get. Gotten. But now that it's yours, you have to pretend you don't want it anywhere near you. You have to fool your friends and loved ones into thinking you don't really like it. You have to fool yourself into thinking you actually care about something else, something more profound
Now, think of those childhood hikes, with friends, on the trails. Now download those maps for all flying use and make sure your children can follow in the exact footsteps you did as a child. Is your tree house now an Airbnb? If it gets five stars, will it forever recoil an inadequacy, knowing that it will never be a birthday childhood memory again? But, I digress. So, here's your truth: there is neither apex nor abyss. Wait, listen. Did you hear that? That was the sound of a distant universe collapsing, a new one forming, and a child laughing. We are here but for the tiniest speck of time. Live in eternal forgiveness. Be OK with every thought. Hurt no one. Stare at your tongue whenever you like. Just ahead, around the corner of time, there is another ion. And another. And always, more children laughing

[Verse 1]
Nothing can compete
With the first time you saw her
Passing strangers on the street
Spending every moment looking at their phones
(Phones) 

[x8]

[Verse 2]
Time spent sitting all alone
Time spent looking at my phone
Time spent sitting all alone
Time spent looking at my phone

I try to pull the curtains back
Turn you off, can't be touched
When all I want and all I know
Is time spent looking at my phone

[Verse 3]
Find me when the lights go down
Signing in and signing out
Gods descend to take me home
Find me staring at my phone

I'm wondering where the hours went
As I'm losing consciousness
My sullen face is all aglow
Time spent looking at my phone

[Chorus]
Last thing that you need
Is the new shiny feature
All the memories you've shared
Devoured by perverted creatures

Nothing can compete
With the first time you saw her
Passing strangers on the street
Spending every moment looking at their phones
(Their phones) 

[x5]

[Verse 4]
Time spent sitting all alone
Time spent looking at my phone
Time spent sitting all alone
Time spent looking at my phone
I call you, you don't call me back
Almost had a heart attack
I'm listening to the window moan
Time spent looking at my phone

[Chorus]
Clouds are getting full
So you close all the windows
I would never let you die
Even if our love is ornamental
You know what you need
Is a way to remember
You can never find the time
If you spend everyday looking at your phone
(Phone) 

[x4]

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
You should come with me
We can lose ourselves in nothing
Copy faces from the feed
And then try to turn them into something
Even if you choose to believe that it's ending
You'll come back to me again
You can go ahead and stop pretending

[Outro]
Doo doo doo doo doo...

[Spoken Word]
-ay, that was James, that's very nice. That was by MGMT and that's not the single but it's the one I like best; I'll play the single, later when it's not uh- when it's not so singly, and I don't feel like I'm being used in having my arm twisted by the giants of the industry. I liked that very much on their record; I've always liked MGMT whenever I hear 'em and I don't differentiate or give a flying beep about the chatter I hear often about their career moves, or whether they could've been the champs if only they hadn't committed financial suicide or whatever; I mean come on! These are artists. The same thing that allows them to make something like that; also it's a burden, a karma of feelings and truth and that they rightfully must bare and they've got to do what they've got to do
The only way to get rid of the feeling
You have to draw the line
And remember there's more than you're seeing
Decide
Do you want to keep us alive?
Do you want to feel alive?
Do you want to keep us alive?
Do you want to feel alive?
(Fun is over tonight)
Do you want to keep us alive?
(Fun is over tonight)
Do you want to feel alive?
(Fun is over tonight)
Do you want to keep us alive?
(Fun is over tonight)
Do you want to feel alive?

One thing left to try
One thing left to try
One thing left to try
One thing left to try
The only way to get rid of the feeling
You have to draw the line
And remember there's more than you're seeing
Decide
Do you want to keep us alive?
Do you want to feel alive?
Do you want to keep us alive?
Do you want to feel alive?
(Fun is over tonight)
Do you want to keep us alive?
(Fun is over tonight)
Do you want to feel alive?
(Fun is over tonight)
Do you want to keep us alive?
(Fun is over tonight)
Do you want to feel alive?

[Verse 1]
The deals we made to shake things up
And the rights that they abused
Might just fuck us over
But the doors won't shut until they're sure
There's nothing left to use
Someone's taking over
Threw it away, but now I say
It's time to hand it over

[Verse 2]
The joke's worn thin, the king stepped in
Now we'll see who is who
Look who's bending over
But the stars weren't wrong, the time felt right
We both knew it was true
The smart ones exit early
And the rest hope for a shoulder

[Verse 3]
If we lose our touch, it won't mean much
If everyone's confused
Which door do we open?
It's the same old trick, they played their hand
Now there's one thing left to do

[Chorus 1]
It’s time (Hand it over)
It's yours and it's mine (Hand it over)
One thing on my mind (Hand it over)
It's rightfully mine (Hand it over)
In the dark (Hand it over)
What's yours is mine (Hand it over)
Mm, make it right (Hand it over)
And give me what's mine (Hand it over)

[Chorus 2]
Oh, this time (Hand it over)
It's yours and mine (Hand it over)
Hey, it's time to hand it over
Just give me what's mine (Hand it over)
Mm, anytime (Hand it over)
It's yours and it's mine (Hand it over)

[Robotic voice]
Ladies and gentlemen, if you're still with us
M,G,M,T
Yes let me hear
Ladies, gentlemen
M,G,M,T
Again
M,G,M,T
I tell you what, these kids are going places I can electric feel it
Now if you don't mind, excuse me while I retreat back into my
Little Dark Age
Let me by my only brother
And you can be your only too (?)
Cause you know that I
Wanna be there for you
Ooo ooo

Let me be my only brother
And you can be your only too (?)
Cause you know that I
Wanna be there for you
And you know o o
I wanna let you do those things you do
Ooo ooo

Ahhh Ah Ah Ahhh Ah Ahh Ah 

[x4]

[Hook: Barney Artist]
I’ve been seeing where these peeps are really from
We keeping the vibe alive we shining just till we hear the song
And hands up if you rep your home
And hands up if you rep your home
Hands up if you rep your home
And hands up if you rep your home

[Verse 1: Barney Artist]
I’m from the Eastside of the city
Where things are known to go down
Spit a round with my lyrics
I’m hitting it from the ground
Let me pound
Barney Artist rep that Eastside B
Forest Gate is the ends and it’s inside me
Street by street
Let the bars invigorate your flow
When I spit it from the road
They’re yelling “Barney let’s go”
Let me flow
Spitting my zone
Barney repping my home
Never lone
I’m keeping the fire pass me the coal
Life's a journey so making friends is the best vibe
Home is somewhere where you’re spending the best time, oh
Always chilling with my G's
In the East
Grab a falafel try eating peace
Let me speak what I see, uh
See what I speak
When I'm breathing on beats
Keep my cypher complete, uh
Eastside is where I call home
Come to ends fam I’ll show you where I roam

[Chorus: Tom Misch]
I kinda miss the days when we would roam
Parkside café stores, then back to mine
Almost every time
What a sweet, sweet day to roam
Golden undertones
Oh, it’s good to be home
Oh, it’s good to be home
Mmm

[Hook: Barney Artist]
I’ve been seeing where these peeps are really from
We keeping the vibe alive we shining just till we hear the song
And hands up if you rep your home
And hands up if you rep your home
Hands up if you rep your home
And hands up if you rep your home

[Verse 2: Loyle Carner]
Uh, yeah
Yo, I would show you how I live
Uh, if I wasn't sat outside the crib (for fuck’s sake)
I left my keys and my misses by the fridge
But no joke I be penning this lyric by the bridge
Uh, that's how it is
Yo, It's like I live a double life
I'm feeling like I'm 40
Kids and a troubled wife
They wake up by the side
Wonder what the day becomes
I dance between my big mothers and my baby ones
I used to play in slums
Now I gotta pay the sums
Three different cribs and ain't got time just to stay in one
I hope this payment comes
So I can change the radiator for the neighbor's one
And maybe get the glazing done
I'm young
But you can see what I'm becoming
Been the mouth of the south ever since I was a youngin'
Uh I need a place to call my own
For the days that I'm alone
But like the beat yo
I just keep running

[Chorus: Tom Misch]
I kinda miss the days when we would roll
Parkside café stores, then back to mine
Almost every time
What a sweet, sweet day to roam
Golden undertones
Oh, it’s good to be home
Oh, it’s good to be home
Mmm

[Hook: Barney Artist]
I’ve been seeing where these peeps are really from
We keeping the vibe alive we shining just till we hear the song
And hands up if you rep your home
And hands up if you rep your home
Hands up if you rep your home
And hands up if you rep your home

[Verse 3: Rebel Kleff]
Check
For me home is just a place where all the traveling stops
A place to rest, lay in my nest before I’m hatching the plot
Seems easy but it’s actually not
It’s hard to function when the time zone’s dropping like a Jack-in-the-box
Not the trials and tribulations of an average job
But more rewarding
Tour’s exhausting but it’s important
So I’m all in
And if home is truly where the heart is
Then my heart’s a moving target
‘Cause I be daily departing
And I could write a book about the cities I’m seeing
But I’ll be forever keeping London city supreme
Though I never pay attention to the postcode walls
Barely at home to check the post no more
Always on the move
I’m on the mission to deliver what they ask for
Looking at the past through the stickers on my passport
Circle the Earth for whatever it’s worth
By representing to the death of me the place I was birthed forever

[Chorus: Tom Misch]
I kinda miss the days when we would roll
Parkside café stores, then back to mine
Almost every time
What a sweet, sweet day to roam
Golden undertones
Oh, it’s good to be home

[Verse 1]
I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser, little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile

[Verse 2]
Well I sold a million mirrors in a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you to be a super star
But I tell you just be satisfied and stay right where you are

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Come on)
Keep yourself alive (Ooh)
It'll take you all your time and your money
Keep you satisfied

[Verse 3]
Well I've loved a million women in a belladonnic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need to feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal

[Verse 4]
I was told a million times of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, same as when I started

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Come on)
Keep yourself alive (Ooh)
It'll take you all your time and your money
To keep yourself alive (shake)

Woah
Watchout
Aww

[Guitar Solo]

Keep yourself alive (Ooh)
Keep yourself alive (Ooh)
You take your time and take my money
And honey, you'll survive

[Bridge]
Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave

[Chorus]
Come on
Keep yourself alive (Yeah)
Keep yourself alive (Ooh)
All you people
Keep yourself alive

Keep yourself alive (Come on)
Keep yourself alive (Ooh)
All you people
Keep yourself alive

Keep yourself alive (Come on, come on)
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money
And honey, you'll survive

Keep yourself alive (Come on)
Keep yourself alive (Mmm)
All you people
Keep yourself alive

[Outro]
Take you all your time and money, honey (Uh)
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Kepp yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
(Fade-out)

[Intro]
Ahhh
Ahhh

[Verse 1]
In the land where horses born with eagle wings
And honey bees have lost their stings
There's singing forever (Ooh, yeah)
Lions' den with fallow deer
And rivers made from wine so clear
Flow on and on forever (and on and on and on)
Dragons fly like sparrows thru' the air
And baby lambs where Samson dares
To go on on on on
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
My fairy king
(He rules the air and turns the tides)
And can see things that are not there for you and me
Ooh yeah (Too soon)
My fairy king
(He guides the winds)
He can do right and nothing wrong, wrong

[Verse 3]
(Ahh)
Then came man to savage in the night
To run like thieves and to kill like knives
To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin to the promised land
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah)

[Verse 4]
They turn the milk into sour
Like the blue in the blood of my veins
(Why can't you see it?)
Fire burnin' in hell with the cry of screaming pain
(Son of heaven set me free and let me go)
Sea turns dry no salt from sand
Seasons fly no helping hand
Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor men's eyes
(No more)

[Outro]
Someone, someone has drained the color from my wings
Broken my fairy circle ring
And shamed the king in all his pride
Changed the winds and wronged the tides
Oh Mother Mercury (Mercury)
Look what they've done to me (yeah)
I cannot run I cannot hide

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Yesterday my life was in ruin
Now today I know what I'm doing
Got a feeling I should be doing all right

[Chorus]
Doing all right

[Verse 2]
Where will I be this time tomorrow
Jumped for joy or sinking in sorrow?
Anyway I should be doing all right

[Chorus]
Doing all right

[Bridge]
(Should be waiting for the sun)
(Looking round to find the words to say)
(Should be waiting for the skies to clear)
(There ain't time in all the world)
Should be waiting for the sun
And anyway I've got to hide-a, hide away

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Verse 3]
Yesterday my life was in ruin
Now today I know what I'm doing
Got a feeling I should be doing alright

[Chorus]
Doing all right

[Guitar Solo 2]

[Outro]
Doing all right

[Verse 1]
I have sinned dear Father
Father, I have sinned
Try and help me Father
Won't you let me in? (Liar!)
Oh, nobody believes me (Liar!)
Why don't they leave me alone?

[Verse 2]
Sire, I have stolen
Stolen many times
Raised my voice in anger
When I know I never should (Liar!)
Oh, everybody deceives me (Liar!)
Why don't you leave me alone? (Rawr!)

[Verse 3]
(Liar) I have sailed the seas
(Liar) From Mars to Mercury
(Liar) I have drunk the wine
(Liar) Time after time
(Liar) You're lying to me
(Liar) You're lying to me

[Verse 4]
Father, please forgive me
You know you'll never leave me
Please will you direct me in the right way?
Liar, liar, liar (Liar)
(Liar) Look what they've done to me
(Liar) Every day, every night
(Liar) All the time

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
Listen
Ooh, you gotta listen
Mama I'm gonna be your slave
(All day long)
Mama, I'm gonna try to behave
(All day long)
Mama, I'm gonna be your slave
(All day long)
I'm gonna love you 'til your dying day
(All day long)
I'm gonna serve you 'til your day
(All day long)
I'm gonna know you 'til you're lying dead
(All day long)
I'm gonna kneel down by your side and pray
(All day long)

[Bridge]
(All day long, all day long, all day long)
All day long
(All day long)
All day long
(All day long)
All day long
(All day long)
All day long
(All day long)
All day long!

[Outro]
All day long, all day long, all day long
(Liar) Liar, they never ever let you win
(Liar) Liar, everything you do is sin
Liar, nobody believes you
Liar, they bring you down before you begin
Ooh, now let me tell you this
Ah yes, before they let you

[Intro]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ahh!

[Verse 1]
Now once upon a time
An old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone
And the soup is cold on your table
And if the black crow flies
To find a new destination
That is the sign

[Chorus]
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight

[Verse 2]
He gives a great big cry
And he can swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue he catches flies
And the palm of a hand, the incredible size
One great big eye
Has a focus in your direction
Now the battle is on

[Chorus]
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight

[Instrumental Interlude 1]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ahh!

[Verse 3]
The ogre men are still inside
The two-way mirror mountain
Got to keep down right out of sight
You can't see in but they can see out
"Ooh, keep a lookout!"
The ogre-men are coming out
From the two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind and they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cause you gotta go south

[Instrumental Interlude 2]

[Verse 4]
Ogre-men are going home
And then the great big fight is over
Bugle blow, let trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives for ever more

[Outro]
Oh-ho-ho
You can come along
You can come along
Come to ogre battle

[Verse 1]
Great King Rat died today
Born on the twenty-first of May
Died syphilis forty-four on his birthday
Every second word he swore
Yes, he was the son of a whore
Always wanted by the law

[Chorus]
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?

[Verse 2]
Where will I be tomorrow?
Will I beg or will I borrow?
I don't care, I don't care anyway
Come on, come on, the time is right
The man is evil and that is right
I told you, ah yes I told you
And that's no lie

[Chrous]
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
People
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?
Let me show you

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know, people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?
Hit it

[Bridge]
Now listen, all you people
Put out the good and keep the bad
Don't believe all you read in the Bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
Very soon you're gonna be his disciple
Don't listen to what mama says
Not a word, not a word mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival
The great Lord before He died
Knelt sinners by his side
And said you're going to realize tomorrow
No, I'm not going to tell you
What you already know
'Cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come, come on the time is right
The man is evil and that is right
I told you once before

[Chorus]
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Just like I said before
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
The last time I tell you
Would you like to see?

[Verse 1]
Had to make do with the worn out rock and roll scene
The old bop is getting tired, need a rest
Well, you know what I mean
'58, that was great
But it's over now and that's all
Somethin' harder's coming up
Gonna really knock a hole in the wall
Gonna hit ya, grab ya hard
Make you feel ten feet tall

[Verse 2]
Well I hope this baby's gonna come along soon
You don't know it could happen any ol' rainy afternoon
With the temperatures down
And the jukebox blowin' no fuse
And my musical life's feelin'
Like a long Sunday School cruise
And you know there's one thing
Every single body could use

[Spoken Word]
Not that I'm bright, just happy go lucky

[Chorus]
(Modern times) Rock and roll
(Modern times) Rock and roll

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Get your high heeled guitar boots
And some groovy clothes
Get a hair piece on your chest
And a ring through your nose
Find a nice little man who says
He's gonna make you a real big star
Stars in your eyes and ants in your pants
Think you should go far
Everybody in this bum sucking world
Gonna know just who you are
Look out!

[Intro]
I want you
Watch out

[Verse 1]
Tried to be a son and daughter
Rolled into one
You said you'd equal any man
For having your fun

[Verse 2]
Ooh, now didn't you feel surprised to find
The cap just didn't fit?
Woman expects a man
To buckle down and to shovel shit

[Chorus]
What'll you do for loving
When its only just begun?
I want you
To be a woman, yeah

[Verse 3]
Tried to be a teacher
And a fisher of men
An equal people preacher
Will you lead us all the same?

[Verse 4]
Well I travelled around the world and found
A brand new word for day
Watching the time, mustn't linger behind
Pardon me I have to get away

[Chorus]
Ooh, what'll you think of heaven
If it's back from where you came?
I want you
To be a woman

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 5]
Ooh, now didn't you feel surprised to find
The cap just didn't fit?
Woman expects a man
To buckle down and to shovel shit

[Chorus]
Ooh, what'll you think of heaven
If it's back from where you came?
I want you
To be a woman

[Chorus]
I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Take a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back, back to when I was alive
Wanna go back, wanna go

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I just wanna go back
Fresh Prince, Nike Airs, all that
CD in an old Mercedes
Driving around listening to Shady like, oh
Never under pressure, oh
Those days it was so much better, oh
Feelin' cool in my youth, relaxin'
No money, no problem
It was easy back then

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, wish that we could go back in time, uh
Got memories
Ooh, maybe we can do it tonight
Tonight's the night

[Chorus]
I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Take a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back, back to when I was alive
Wanna go back, wanna go
I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Take a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back, back to when I was alive
Wanna go back, wanna go

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I remember back home
Best friends, all night, no phone
No cares, I was dumb and so young
My room singing Michael Jackson (Hee, hee)
Never under pressure, oh
Those days it was so much better, oh
Feelin' cool in my youth, I'm askin'
"Does anyone remember how we did it back then?"

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, wish that we could go back in time, uh
Got memories
Ooh, maybe we could do it tonight
Tonight's the night
Ah, yeah

[Chorus]
I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Took a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back, back to when I was alive
Wanna go back, wanna go

[Post-Chorus]
Back to where we came from
Playin' air guitar on the roof
In the kitchen, up on the table
Like we had a beautiful view
I wanna go
I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Ah, yeah

[Bridge]
Ah, yeah
Ah, yeah
Ah, yeah
I wanna go back

[Chorus]
I just wanna go back, back to 1999 (Yeah, go back, go back)
Take a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back, back to when I was alive
Wanna go back, wanna go

[Post-Chorus]
Back to where we came from
Playin' air guitar on the roof
In the kitchen, up on the table
Like we had a beautiful view
I wanna go
I just wanna go back, back to 1999

[Outro]
Go back, yeah, yeah
I just wanna go back, back to 1999, yeah
I just wanna go back, back to 1999, yeah

[Chorus]
We will, we will rock you (sing it)
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you (sing it)
We will, we will rock you

[Verse 1]
Buddy, you’re a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face, you big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place (singing)

[Chorus]
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you (sing it)
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

[Intro]
(Lil Boat)

[Verse 1]
Stay with the MAC like Apple
Talking that shit, have them come in your chapel
Young nigga fly, I can fly pterodactyl
Got a new bitch with a son, he a rascal
I get the bag from the city, the capital
These niggas fake and Lil Boat be the actual
Beefing online but in person you rational
I do not get it
Making this money, it's making them livid
The shit that you rap bout, you know you don't live it
I got the coupe with the top, you can lift it
I got the coupe with the engine, go drift it
Diamonds, they wet like a cup of the mystic
Living this life, so futuristic
Stay optimistic

[Open Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Off the top of the dome
I'm a big boss, Al Capone
Rocking 

[?] like my name was Jerome
You want the smoke, told the boy to come on
All of the gang members, what's up and I'm on
Fuck with the set, look at my phone
I do not club, that's not what I do
I stay at home and sleep in the stu'
Plotting on ways to build up revenue
Catch me outside on the old avenue
Been a star player, check the attributes
Been 'bout the guap since I had sessions too
Know they want the boy hung by a noose
Won't catch me lacking, I stay with the truth
Shoot night roofs and a light handed loops
Shoot, shoot, shoot

[Open Chorus]

[Intro]
1, 2, 3, 4

[Chorus]
I spy with my little eye
Something that can get you high
High, high, high, high, high, high, high, high
I spy with my little eye
Something that can get you high
High, high, high, high, high, high, high, high

[Verse 1]
Does this look good to you, mister?
When you stare, like you just saw a film star
Hipper than the average chicka
Cause I make that heart go quicker
Hasta, Mr. La Gangsta
Will you hold me from the hip, that chocha?
Take a look at the time on my watch
Took a break, what’s your 

[?] on my sofa?
I love it when
I'm the surfer, watching television
Put on the the radio
A cameo intermission
My dudes are here
And they calling on my transmission
If you know why, then I hit your proper transactions

[Chorus]
I spy with my little eye
Something that can get you high
High, high, high, high, high, high, high, high
I spy with my little eye
Something that can get you high
High, high, high, high, high, high, high, high

[Verse 2]
I break you in like shoes, or my new jeans
I go within, I'm a spanner in your work thing
I’m wishing one more, curious to dirty things
I'll make you swing from being asleep to new things
You're 

[?], I'm from Colombia
I can cross in from my home to Jamaica
On the street, boats, straight from my sender
Cover me, oh, if you want a bender
Is today our fire starter?
I ain’t thinking ‘bout shit in 

[?]
Cut bone I’m shipped to Asia
I’m adopted, paddle in the lake, yeah

[Chorus]
I spy with my little eye
Something that can get you high
High, high, high, high, high, high, high, high
I spy with my little eye
Something that can get you high
High, high, high, high, high, high, high, high

[Outro]
I spy with my little eye

[Verse 1]
I’m way too damaged to go home
I keep dancing here with my eyes closed
Like nothing matters anymore

[Chorus]
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that

[Verse 2]
Make my heart run back and forth
You’re everything I want and more
I think you’re down but I’m not sure

[Chorus]
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that

[Bridge]
Make it hard to talk and see
I'm just where I wanna be
Holding you too close to me
You never leave my glass empty
Ooooh, we got nothing
Ooooh, and that's all we wanted
Broken people in the streets
Yet they’re beautiful to see
Everything is incomplete
Yeah, it feels a lot like me
Ooooh, we got nothing
Ooooh, and that's all we wanted

[Chorus]
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that

[Verse 3]
I’m way too damaged to go home
I keep dancing here with my eyes closed
Like nothing matters anymore
And I like that, kinda like that
Make my heart run back and forth
You’re everything I want and more
I think you’re down but I’m not sure

[Chorus]
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that

[Chorus]
Hide away, find a space to be alone
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Hide away, find a space to be alone
Hmm
And peace sublime
Every single day, I got a heartache comin' my way
I don’t wanna say goodbye
Baby but look at the tears in my eye
I don't wanna say goodbye
Mama but look at the way you made me cry
Every way that's nice
You show you’ve got a heart that's made of ice

And I know
Fire and water must have made you their daughter
You've got what it takes, to make a poor man's heart break
A poor mans heart break

Baby you turn me on
But as quick as a flash your love is gone
Baby I'm gonna leave you now
But I'm gonna try to make you grieve somehow

Fire and water must have made you their daughter
You've got what it takes to make a poor man's heart break
A poor man’s heart break
And my heart is breakin’ too
I don't wanna say goodbye baby
But look at the tears you made me cry
Every way that’s nice
You show you've got a heart that's made of ice
And I know

Fire and water must have made you their daughter
You've got what it takes to make a poor mans heart break

Fire, fire and water must have made you their daughter
Baby you’ve got what it takes to make a poor man's heart break
Heart break

Baby and my heart is breakin'
Oh my heart is breakin'
Oh listen

[Verse 1]
You're a song written by the hands of God
Don't get me wrong 'cause this might sound to you a bit odd
But you own the place where all my thoughts go hiding
Right under your clothes, is where I find them

[Chorus]
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl honey

[Verse 2]
'Cause of you, I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you, I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone, when the party's over
We will still belong to each other

[Chorus]
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl honey
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl
Hey hey hey hey hey

[Bridge]
I love you more than all that's on the planet
Movin', talkin', walkin', breathin'
You know it's true
Oh baby it's so funny almost don't believe it
As every voice is hangin' from the silence
Lamps are hangin' from the ceilin'
Like a lady tied to her manners
I'm tied up to this feeling

[Outro]
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl
For being such a good girl
For being such a good girl

[Verse 1]
It's not her fault that she's so irresistible
But all the damage she's caused isn't fixable
Every twenty seconds you repeat her name
But when it comes to me, you don't care
If I'm alive or dead, so

[Chorus]
Objection!
I don't wanna be the exception
To get a bit of your attention
I love you for free and I'm not your mother
But you don't even bother
Objection!
I'm tired of this triangle
Got dizzy dancing tango
I'm falling apart in your hands again
No way, I've got to get away

[Verse 2]
Next to her cheap silicone, I look minimal
That's why in front of your eyes, I'm invisible
But you've got to know small things also count
Better put your feet on the ground
And see what it's about, so

[Chorus]
Objection!
I don't wanna be the exception
To get a bit of your attention
I love you for free and I'm not your mother
But you don't even bother
Objection!
I'm tired of this triangle
Got dizzy dancing tango
I'm falling apart in your hands again
No way, I've got to get away

[Bridge]
I wish there was a chance for you and me
I wish you couldn't find a place to be away from here
This is pathetic and sardonic
It's sadistic and psychotic
Tango is not for three; was never meant to be
But you can try it, rehearse it or train like a horse
But don't you count on me
Don't you count on me, boy

[Chorus]
Objection!
I don't wanna be the exception
To get a bit of your attention
I love you for free and I'm not your mother
But you don't even bother
Objection!
I'm tired of this triangle
Got dizzy dancing tango
I'm falling apart in your hands again
No way, I've got to get away, get away, get away, hey, hey, hey, get away

[Outro]
Ah ah ha ha ha ha ha ha x2
I'm falling apart in your hands again
Get away
I'm falling apart in your hands again
Get away, get away

[Verse 1]
Lucky you were born that far away so
We could both make fun of distance
Lucky that I love a foreign land for
The lucky fact of your existence
Baby, I would climb the Andes solely
To count the freckles on your body
Never could imagine there were only
Ten million ways to love somebody

[Pre-Chorus]
Le ro lo le lo le, le ro lo le lo le
Can't you see? I’m at your feet

[Chorus]
Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you’ll be near
And that's the deal, my dear
Thereover, hereunder
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
But that's the deal, my dear

[Verse 2]
Lucky that my lips not only mumble
They spill kisses like a fountain
Lucky that my breasts are small and humble
So you don't confuse them with mountains
Lucky I have strong legs like my mother
To run for cover when I need it
And these two eyes that for no other
The day you leave will cry a river

[Pre-Chorus]
Le ro lo le lo le, le ro lo le lo le
At your feet
I'm at your feet

[Chorus]
Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together

Lost in my eyes

[Chorus]
Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you’ll be near
And that's the deal, my dear
Thereover, hereunder
You've got me head over heels
There's nothing left to fear
If you really feel the way I feel
Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear
Thereover, hereunder
You've got me head over heels
There's nothing left to fear
If you really feel the way I feel

Everybody get offended by the shit I got on

Nine hundred horse, can you drive that, nigga?
A G5, can you fly that, nigga?

Without niggas takin' a piece of mine
And peace be still and not do fines, so fuck a fix-it ticket

I walk in the trap and I pour up a eight
I catch a quarter million Bentley truck
Whippin' my wrist in the pot, I don't give a fuck
Wish a nigga well, gotta go double up
Left wrist Rolex, sixty thousand for my shit it's frozen up
Red beam on their head, I'ma hit em up
Drop yo location, nigga let's go get it up
Bust down on a bracelet
Fifty thousand for my jeweler, spent it, I ain't give no fuck
Young Drako nigga, you know I'm real nigga
Young Drako nigga you know I be trappin', my nigga
Young Drako run through the millions
Young Drako stack up money to the ceiling, my nigga
Had to go get a ticket
Most of these niggas be really bitches
Twin-Turbo when I skrrt this shit too the limit
Catch me in the trap, nigga I'm whippin' fishes
Okay, but that's another story, back to this trap shit
In the trenches, put a hundred thousand in my mattress
Fuck with Drako, bitch you know I'm bout action
Make the wrong move, then my nigga start clappin'
You want a pint of drink, you know that I tax you
I'm the CEO of Money Gang, and nigga we blastin'
Hop in the Rari, and skrrt in that Aston
White Maserati, same color as Casper
Jump in the foreign, you know it go faster
A hundred bitches on my P, just like Master
Brand new Rari, man I don't do the masda
Ooh I meant Mazda, ooh I'm eatin' lobsters
Hundred dollar Gucci shirt, I pop collar
Thousand dollar gold bottle, I pop it
Big draco on me, I don't gotta cock it
I put a hundred bricks in helicopters
This shit ain't got no hook, but I'm steady goin'
Stand in that trap, and I'm makin' it storm
Tornado whip my wrist, I fuck up my arm
Two-tone Cuban link, I switch up the charm
I walk in that club, and they ring an alarm
I'm seeing a junkie, I'm servin' the bomb
Giuseppe my toes, I do that for fun
I fuck on yo bitch while I'm grippin' my gun
I'm throwin' blue hundreds, I don't throw the ones
I walk in that club, the strippers like "ooh, here he come"
Hop out the Rari with hundred round drum
Young Drako nigga, you know where I'm from
Young Drako nigga, came straight out the slums
Young Drako play with the pots, and the bricks, and the bon
I'm in yo bitch mouth, right on her tongue
Nigga want beef, it's filet mignon
I ride in the Rover, I'm mixin' the soda
They call me Young Drako, they call me Young Soulja
Earring right, boulder
Left ring, half quarter
Bust down, new Rollie
This bitch actin' like she know me
VVS, out the water
Young Drako, nigga I'm fuckin' yo daughter
Malibu noble, you know that
I rock new designer, I don't do the throwback
When you get money, you don't gotta show that
I see the Police, I'm runnin' a four flat
I'm hoppin' the gate
Most of these niggas, you know that they fake
It ain't my birthday but you know I'm gettin' to the cake
I put the Yacht right by the lake
Hit from the back, bust on her face

[Outro]
Young Drako, nigga

Gang, Gang, Gang

Skrrt

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning
Feeling lonely
You were gone and my cell phone too
But what is this feeling?
Empty inside my head
Feels like a heart attack
Ohh ohh, Wooh!

[Verse 2]
I miss you so bad
The thought of you makes me sad
I'm going mad
(No, I'm not)
Ohh ohh!

[Chorus]
Can't help it, I just miss you
How did I lose you now again?
Can't help it, I just miss you
Why did I lose you now again?
Wooh!

[Bridge]
Pa-la-pa-la
Feeling lonely
Pa-la-pa-la
Pa-la-pa-la

Pa-la-pa-la
You were gone and my cell phone too
You were gone and my cell phone too
Ohh ohh

[Chorus]
Can't help it, I just miss you
How did I lose you now again?
Can't help it, I just miss you
Why did I lose you now again?
Feeling lonely!
Wooh!

[Verse 1]
Come you ladies and you gentlemen, a-listen to my song
Sing it to you right, but you might think it’s wrong
Just a little glimpse of a story I’ll tell
’Bout an East Coast city that you all know well
It’s hard times in the city
Living’ down in New York town

[Verse 2]
Old New York City is a friendly old town
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down
There’s a-mighty many people all milling’ all around
They’ll kick you when you’re up and knock you when you’re down
It’s hard times in the city
Living’ down in New York town

[Verse 3]
It’s a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
To Rockefeller Plaza ’n’ the Empire State
Mister Rockefeller sets up as high as a bird
Old Mister Empire never says a word
It’s hard times from the country
Living down in New York town

[Verse 4]
Well, it’s up in the morning trying to find a job of work
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt
If you got a lot o’ money you can make yourself merry
If you only got a nickel, it’s the Staten Island Ferry
And it’s hard times in the city
Living down in New York town

[Verse 5]
Mister Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
And old Mister Minuet paid for his dream
Bought your city on a one-way track
’F I had my way I’d sell it right back
And it’s hard times in the city
Living down in New York town

[Verse 6]
I’ll take all the smog in Cal-i-for-ne-ay
’N’ every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
’N’ the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines
It’s all much cleaner than the New York kind
And it’s hard times in the city
Living down in New York town

[Verse 7]
So all you newsy people, spread the news around
You can listen to m’ story, listen to m’ song
You can step on my name, you can try ’n’ get me beat
When I leave New York, I’ll be standing’ on my feet
And it’s hard times in the city
Living down in New York town

[Verse 1]
Well I'll sing you a song, It ain't very long
About an old man, he never done wrong
How he died no one can say
They found him dead in the street one day

[Verse 2]
Well, the crowd, they gathered one fine morn
At the man whose clothes 'n' shoes were torn
There on the sidewalk he did lay
They stopped 'n' stared 'n' they went their way

[Verse 3]
Well, the p'liceman come and he looked around
"Get up, old man, or I'm a-takin' you down."
And he jabbed him once with his billy club
The old man then rolled off the curb

Well, hmm Jesus I just can't get it, I-I lost the verses

[Verse 1]
If today was not a crooked highway
If tonight I could finally stand tall
If tomorrow wasn’t such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all
Yes, and only if my own true love was waitin’
Yes, and if I could hear her heart a-softly poundin’
Only if she was lyin’ by me
Then I’d lie in my bed once again

[Verse 2]
I can’t see my reflection in the waters
I can’t speak the sounds that know no pain
I can’t hear the echo of my footsteps
I can’t remember the sound of my own name
Yes, and only if my own true love was waitin’
Yes, and if I could hear her heart a-softly poundin’
Only if she was lyin’ by me
Then I’d lie in my bed once again

[Verse 3]
There’s beauty in the silver, singin’ river
There’s beauty in the sunrise in the sky
But none of these and nothing else can match the beauty
That I remember in my true love’s eyes
Yes, and only if my own true love was waitin’
If I could hear her heart a-softly poundin’
Only if she was lyin’ by me
Then I’d lie in my bed once again

[Verse 4]
Yes, and only if my own true love was waitin’
If I could hear her heart a-softly poundin’
Yes, and only if she was lyin’ by me
Then I’d lie in my bed once again

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Tell me, how that sound? (Ooh, ooh)
How that sound? How that sound?
You tellin' me wait for later
Well, look baby don't you know? I want you now

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
(2 Chainz!)
You don't have to get up lil' baby
I got me a butler to clean up the palace
Oops, I mean to say palace
Just follow the money and that is my address
Oops, now here come the madness (Madness)
I'm doin' lay-up lines with the atlas
I take a girl out to eat, then I feed her to the mattress
Turn her over, have her eatin' the mattress
Turn her over, have her bein' dramatic
Havin' sex wearin' a black Patek
Fat ass got me asthmatic
Droppin' ashes on the marble floor
Was in the Hall like Arsenio (Arsenio)
Walked in the garage and I say "eenie, meenie miney, moe"
I'll take you or you (Ugh,) all this loot I blew (Ugh)
All the shit I do (Ugh,) need a pooper scoop (Ugh)
How that shit sound? (How that shit sound?) Still won't sit down (I'm a standup nigga)

Stick around, baby stick that ass out
Stick around, baby sit that ass down

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
I want you now, not later
Baby, let's create some haters (Make 'em mad)
I want to fuck you forever (forever)
But I ain't signin' no papers (Can't do it)
I blew a bag at Aces
Ended up fuckin' a waitress
Every whip I ever had was white (On white)
Niggas thought I was racist (Racist)
Foreign dealer in the trap
Shawty don't like rappers
Bitch, I'm a gangster I just rap (Me neither)
She only send pictures through Snap (Wooh!)
Boss bitches got boss niggas
Lost bitches like lost niggas
You a weird ho, you fuckin' weirdos
On some real shit, I know a few of those

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Tell me, how that sound? (Ooh, ooh)
How that sound? How that sound?
You tellin' me wait for later
Well, look baby don't you know? I want you now
How that sound? (How that sound, how that sound?)

How that sound? Got my hands on your body (Yeah)
How that sound? Got some bands for the party (Yeah)
Stick around, baby sit that ass down
Stick around, baby stick that ass out
Stick around, baby sit that ass down
Stick around, baby stick that ass out

Stick that ass out

[Verse 1]
Sweaty body, the sun is burning
Yeah, I'm feeling kinda hot right now
And my t-shirt is now useless

[Verse 2]
I thought I was ready
Obviously I wasn’t
My body's burning
And I've got to get inside
’Cause I'm feeling kinda dizzy

[Chorus]
But remember that I love you
And you know I always will
And remember that I'll dream about you, baby
(I'll dream about you, baby)

[Verse 3]
Baby, I have to go
Really need to leave now
Yeah, I'm putting on my t-shirt
It's not what I want to
But I have to get inside
'Cause I'm feeling way too dizzy

[Chorus]
But remember that I love you
And you know I always will
And remember that I’ll dream about you, baby
(Yeah!)

[Outro]
But remember that I love you
And you know I always will
And remember that I’ll dream about you, baby

[Verse 1]
John met me down on the boulevard
Cry on his shoulder 'cause life is hard
The waves came in over my head
What you been up to, my baby?
Haven't seen you 'round here lately
All of the guys tell me lies, but you don't
You just crack another beer
And pretend that you're still here

[Chorus]
This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear

[Verse 2]
Joe met me down at the training yard
Cuts on his face 'cause he fought too hard
I know he's in over his head
But I love that man like nobody can
He moves mountains and pounds them to ground again
I watched the guys getting high as they fight
For the things that they hold dear
To forget the things they fear

[Chorus]
This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Now it's been years since I left New York
I've got a kid and two cats in the yard
The California sun and the movie stars
I watch the skies getting light as I write
As I think about those years
As I whisper in your ear

[Outro]
I'm always going to be right here
No one's going anywhere

[Verse 1]
Will you ever
Say you love me
Say you want me
Or whatever?

I have wondered
If you need me
It doesn't always
Seem like it

[Chorus 1]
But after all is fine
That you need this much time
It’s obvious what you think
I understand

[Verse 2]
Will you ever
Care about me
Ask about me
Talk whenever?
I've been waiting
Really struggling
Since forever
To make you smile

[Chorus 2]
But if you say goodbye
I won't be asking why
It’s obvious what you think
About us

[Post-Chorus]
I'm tired of everything
Let me know
Oh, do you feel the same?

[Verse 1]
Don't forget me
You know I'll say
That this could be just us and no one else
Get my hopes up
I know you'll say
That we should just stay off each other's worlds

[Refrain]
Ha-ha ha-ha
Ha-ha ha-ha

[Verse 2]
Don't forget me
I'll leave it there
You can't discuss, I'm over here 'til then
Can't forget you
Too beautiful
Why can't this be just us? I love you so

[Refrain]
Ha-ha ha-ha
Ha-ha ha-ha

[Verse]
You seem to be down
And I don't see why
Is it something that I've done?
I thought you were fine
Now you don't wanna talk
Can you tell me what is wrong?

[Bridge]
I need to say to you
I don't understand

[Chorus]
Yeah, I need to understand
Why you want so much space
Yeah, I need to understand
Why you're making that face

There were five pairs of eyes on you today, I counted
Do you mind? I doubt it
I'm white in the West so I'm sure if I shout it

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I'm fawning
And you're yawning
And I'm following you 'round
From dusk 'til dawnin', well

[Chorus]

On the streets of Genoa
Je ne travaillez, jamais travaillez
I never, ever was
Je ne travaillez, jamais travaillez

[Verse 2]
I love you completely, and you just let me
There are better men out there so forget me
I need you too much, are you sick of my touch?
While the whole world melts, am I meant to just watch?
Now I know how a suckerfish feels
Shit, I better call my dad
I think I'm goin' mad
Not even sure if you're treating me bad

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I'm fawning
And you're yawning

[Bridge]
I made it home, I made it known
I am here to stay
I made it home, I made it known
I am here to stay
I made it home, I made it home
I made it home

[Chorus]
I told myself I had to be a different someone (A different someone, a different someone)
In order to win at a war I had already won (I had already won)
Yeah, I'd given up on the saying "I'll never give up" (I'll never give up, no)
But look at me now
Yeah, look at me, I'm limitless (I'm limitless)
Look at me now
Yeah, look at me, I'm limitless (Yeah, I'm limitless)
Yeah, look at me now
Yeah, look at me, I'm limitless (Yeah, I'm limitless)

And I’m tryna take you all out, put bombs in your girl's scout

[Outro: Kodak Black]
I'm in London, got my beat from London

[Intro]
Ay, how many hoes you 'bout to fuck, fool? Twelve
(We got London on da track)
Hey
Let it all work out, aye
Let it all work out

[Verse 1]
1991, Big Duck had a nigga named Lil Jeff
Started from the bottom, now a nigga so high, you gotta watch your damn step
Never wore fake gold, nigga, diamond’s water like it knew Michael Phelps
Every time I get a shape-up, I give 'em Jacksons like niggas was Michael, yeah
Nut by myself, hut by myself
Fight break off in the chain gang, they ain’t gettin' cut by myself
Nigga same thing, nigga bang bang, I did a lot of things for this wealth
Eww, what’s left?
Calculator living, now she fuck me on the steps
50k a show, I pray to God I don’t get killed
Plus, she pray to God I don’t get killed 'cause she need help
Four diamonds, tuck me in my belt
Nigga, how the hell you gon' throw the profit?
My old school own diamonds, squat it
Nigga, let 'em have it
How many, how many girls
So many years without Tampax Pearls
But you forgot to train your lil' girl, let, let this shit work out

[Chorus]
Hey, let this shit work out
Oh, let this shit work out
Hey, let it all work out, out
Let it all work out out out, out out
Let it all work out out out, out out
Out out, out out, out out, out out
Let it work out, work out

[Verse 2]
God, this bitch, wanna fuck, Thug, swag
Hunnids bagged up, up, up
Pass that clique, I'ma meet her like a damn ticket
Feed my dick, word for brick, I'm the highest hippie
House blacked out, red opps, don't get caught
Fuck a partner, iced out Rollie, I ain't gon' sugarcoat it
Let let let let, let it all work out
I'm a junkie, I spend racks like a cash cow
Bih- bitch, I control everything from the couch
I done served this bitch so much dick, she don't know how to walk

[Outro]
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out
We got London On Da Track

[Verse 1]
You walk into the office in your corporate attire
It's only morning tea time yet I'm burning with desire
I'll catch you in the corridor, a smart casual blouse
You brush past my cubicle, I'm instantly aroused
I watched you at your desk this morning, filling out some spreadsheets
I could not help but picture you spread out on my bed sheets
I watch you from the water cooler, talking to finance
I had to take my paper cup and pour it down my pants
Well, let's get out of these clothes
Let's get out of this office
Is that a tent in your pants?
No, that's a two-bedroom cottage
Gonna feel your boober in the back of the Uber
I'm going to play with your jacksie while you pay for the taxi
Well, you look good in that skirt
And you look good in that shirt
Well, you look so good it hurts
And then we... uh-uh!

[Bridge 1]
Ooh, just two irresistible forces
The tension is mounting
Ooh, I'm Deanna from human resources
And I'm Iain from accounting

[Verse 2]
Well, you've waxed your legs
Your legs are looking smooth
Your legs are looking fine
Uh, uh, ooh, uh
I've only waxed one leg
The left leg, then I ran out of time
Well, you've got one hot leg
You're intoxicating, you smell so sweet
It's like confectionery
Thanks, it's my deodorant
You've been learning big words
From a big word book
A dictionary?
Yeah, that's it, thanks
You've removed your clothes
And my underclothes
You look good nude?
Yeah, I do
'Cause I had a spray tan, been working on my pecks
And I trimmed my pubes
And they're the perfect length of pube, oh

[Chorus 1]
Can't fight this fire
Can't fight this feeling
Let's take it higher
I'm gonna spunk on the ceiling
You can touch my boobies, like they do in rude movies
As when we're finished we'll have to replace all the duvets
Ooh, it's just human nature
Yeah, it's a primal calling
Ooh, I'm Deanna, Deanna from HR
And I'm Iain from accounting
Ooh, can't put out this fire
No, not even with a fountain
Ooh, we are bound by human desire
And I'm Iain from accounting

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
You've been learning sex moves
'Cause you just touched my nips
Yes, I've been reading Cosmo for clothes advice and sex tips
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex tips
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex tips
Hey girls, spice things up
Try touching his nips. Oh!

[Chorus 2]
We couldn't fight this fire
Couldn't fight this feeling
We took it higher
Now let's wipe off the ceiling
We should go back to work
Well, I've got spunk on my shirt
I'm going to wipe down the ottoman
Ooh, that I had my bottom on
I had a good time Iain
Ah, I had a great time Deanna
We should throw out that rug
I wouldn't eat that banana

[Outro]
Ooh, just two irresistible forces
It's a primal calling
Ooh, I'm Deanna from human resources
And I'm Iain from accounting
Deanna from HR
And Iain from accounting

And now I'm back to a man
Did you see that?

It's so seamless

Yeah
Yeah

It's true
This one's called "Back on the Road"
And it's about that feeling

Back, back on the road
Another night, another show
We'd love to stay but we'd prefer to go
Back on the road
Another night singing about nothing
Another hotel, another complimentary muffin
Another tour bus on a highway set adrift
Another gig missed because we're stuck inside a lift
Another venue, another backstage pass
Another groupie with a goldfish in her ass
We've had some fun, yeah
We've had a lot of laughs out on the road
We're sorry, London
We've got to get back back on the road

Back on the back on the back on the back on the road
Got to get back back back back on the road
Got to go got to go back on the road
Got to get back back on the road
We did another show put a fish in your asshole and then we go go go oww oww
You left a hole in our soul we left a sole in your hole but we got to go got to go got to get back on the road
We gave you a backstage pass then put a bass in your ass and then we go
Put a mackerel in your crackerel but we got to get backerel on the road
There's a plaice in your case but we got to go
There's a starfish in your starfish we got to go, got to get going
Put a fish in your tush, fish, tush
Gotta get back, back, back, back, on the road
Gotta go, gotta go
Gotta get back on the road
Thank you, London
This is the strangest story that you'll ever hear
Unless you can't hear
In which case, this'll be the weirdest tale you've ever lip-read

I'll tell you the story of a dangerous man
Some say he was born with a gun in his hand
An only child and a motherless son
In his class he was the difficult one

He had a predilection for killing and hating
And his name was an anagram of Satan
Bad attitude, bad blood, bad grammar

A man by the name of Stana

Whoa, Stana

Talking about a bad man, London

A very bad man
An evil man
His very name was a Satan-agram

He's the kind of man who would walk around without any pants on
And take a Viagra
Just pop into town at the supermarket with an erection

Man, he'd would poke babies in the eye
Unrelated to the last fact

He'd steal your goat, you don't know what he would do with it

Bad things

He'd steal your WiFi

His name was a Satan-agram
Just like Santa
But he was nothing like Santa
No, Santa is a wonderful man
Who brings presents
Comes down your chimney and brings you presents
Whereas Stana is just a man who comes down your chimney

Why someone do that?
Ruin a lovely fireside evening
Well, them people

They were sick of him groping their goats and raping their sheep
Then one night
They drugged his drink
They tried to sneak out while he was asleep
But Stana awoke before they got out of town
Because their drug was just too weak
He gathered them 'round
Shot every one of them down
Right there in the street

He shot everybody in the town down
And then you know what he said?
He said, "I'm out of this place
This town's dead anyway!"
He kinda did it like that, where the head went
"This town's dead anyway"

"It's too soon, Stana"

"That's rude! What are you?"
He's literally adding insult to injury

He put on his hat and got on his horse
And to a new town he set his course
Went to a place to grab a bite to eat
Could not believe what he saw out on that street
Outside where the wind blew into two directions
Stana seemed to look at his own reflection
A man identical to imperfection
Same eyes, same lies, same sized erection

Oh, erection

I know what you're thinking
You're thinking he had a big one
Nope

Oh, you thought 'cause he was a bad boy, he'd have a big ol' one

Yeah

You thought he'd have a big huge-a-rooni
No, no, no, no, no

No, London
No, London

That's a rumor put out by bad guys

Oh, yeah

"Give me all your money, and when they come, you say I had a big one."

Well, I was just gonna mention, you know who does have big ones is musicians

Right

Exactly, definitely

Well, they drew their guns
Both at once and aimed their shots directly
No one there had seen such a thing
Well, it's not what you'd expect to see
Bullets flew at the very same time
On the very same trajectory
What I say is true
'Cause I was there
And them bullets flew right next to me

Yeah

Them bullets stopped right there as they met in the air
Then they fell to the ground without making a sound
Each man dropped his jaw and fired five more
Each pair of bullets was the same as before
They raised their brows as they saw the side
Of the bullets as they stopped each others flight
As though they were filled with pure elation
They began to laugh 'cause it was quite a funny situation

Whoa, funny situation

Turns out this other guy's name is Anats
Satan-agram

The two men couldn't shoot each other
'Cause they were absolutely perfectly matched in every way
So instead, they went to a cafe

They started chatting
Turned out they had more in common than just physical appearances

That's right, very similar experiences
They'd done a lot of the same things
And they loved the same kind of activities
Like hurting people and maiming

They, they got on like a house on fire
Which is also one of the first things they did together

They both shared a love for predatory large cats

You know, tigers

Lions

Ocelots

Lynxes

You have any big cats here in London?
They're like big beavers

They don't have beavers

You guys don't have beavers?
What the fuck? Oh, badgers
That's what you guys have

Badgers, that's what they...
Go out hunting for English beavers

They became attached together
Like a brain and a tumor
Same taste, same hobbies

Same sense of humor

They bought a farm, started breeding puma
And they became lovers
Well, that's the rumor

Well, that's what happened when Anats met Stana
But they say we all got our doppelganger
That might be false

But it might be true
Oh, what would you do if you met you?

That's the real question
What would you do if you met yourself?
If you were confronted by your own person?
Maybe you'd look at that other you in the eye, and just think
"I understand you
Because I am you."
And you'd walk up to that person
And you'd hold them
The way you've always wanted to be held
But no one's ever got it quite right
Sometimes they've done it too tightly
Sometimes they've done it too loosely
With their arms all floppy like spaghetti...
Dangling around
But this hug between you and that other you is a perfect consistency of hug
Then, while you're there with your hands around your self
You think, "Well, I wonder what my butt feels like."
And you just, like
You know, like, spider-walk one of your hands down to your other self's butt-on!
And give it a little squeeze
And "Whoa!
What's happening back there?"
The other you's doing the same thing
Hello
Is this wrong?
And then you wonder
"I wonder if I'm a good kisser."
So you kiss that other you
And you know what?
Straight away it feels right, it feels good
It feels like love

They've fallen in love
An emotional connection
Two very evil men
With minuscule erections

Stana and Anats
Anats and Stana
Looking after each other now
Looking after panthers

They used to be murderin', murderin', murderin'

Now they're cuddlin', cuddlin', cuddlin'

Used to be threatenin', threatenin', threatenin'
Now they're getting big cats and pettin' em

Used to be homicidal and killin'
Now, they're in a domicile and chillin'

Used to be slayin' and slayin' and slayin'

And now they're gayin' and gayin' and gayin'

They found a little love
They found a little love
They found a little love
They found a little love
They found a little love

Sorry about that
That was just far too long
That was...

It was like a whole show

Yeah

Don't know if it's gotten longer every night

(Lil Boat)

[Verse 1]
Stay with the MAC like Apple
Talking that shit, have them come in your chapel
Young nigga fly, I can fly pterodactyl
Got a new bitch with a son, he a rascal
I get the bag from the city, the capital
These niggas fake and Lil Boat be the actual
Beefing online but in person you rational
I do not get it
Making this money, it's making them livid
The shit that you rap bout, you know you don’t live it
I got the coupe with the top, you can lift it
I got the coupe with the engine, go drift it
Diamonds, they wet like a cup of the mystic
Living this life, so futuristic
Stay optimistic

[Chorus]
Anarchy, anarchy
My life, it look like your fantasy
You can't imagine my salary
Counting my money like calories
Women, they all coming after me
Call me a friar like gasoline
I'm on the track, it’s a masterpiece
I steal your girl, that's a tragedy
All of these dudes, they mad at me
I keep on balling like 23
No one can stop me, it's anarchy
Anarchy, anarchy, anarchy
Ayy, ooh, no one can stop me, it's anarchy
Anarchy, anarchy, anarchy
No one can stop me, it's anarchy

[Verse 2]
Off the top of the dome
I'm a big boss, Al Capone
Rock MCM like my name was Jerome
You want the smoke, told the boy to come on
All of the gang members, what's up and I'm on
Fuck with the set, look at my phone
I do not club, that’s not what I do
I stay at home and sleep in the stu’
Plotting on ways to build up revenue
Catch me outside on the old avenue
Been a star player, check the attributes
Been 'bout the guap since I had sessions too
Know they want the boy hung by a noose
Won’t catch me lacking, I stay with the truth
Shoot night roofs and a light handed loops
Shoot, shoot, shoot, yeah

[Chorus]
Anarchy, anarchy
My life, it look like your fantasy
You can't imagine my salary
Counting my money like calories
Women, they all coming after me
Call me a friar like gasoline
I'm on the track, it's a masterpiece
I steal your girl, that’s a tragedy
All of these dudes, they mad at me
I keep on balling like 23
No one can stop me, it's anarchy
Anarchy, anarchy, anarchy
Ayy, ooh, no one can stop me, it's anarchy
Anarchy, anarchy, anarchy
No one can stop me, it's anarchy

[Verse 1]
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting... 'til the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers 'cause we are the champions...
Of the world

[Verse 2]
I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose

[Outro]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting... 'til the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers 'cause we are the champions...
Of the world
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting... 'til the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers 'cause we are the champions...
Of the world

[Intro: Freddie & Roger]
Okay, okay, this is called, uh, "Fat Bottomed Girls"
(Uh one, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
Are you gonna take me home tonight?
Oh, down beside your red firelight?
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rockin' world go round
Hey!

[Verse 1]
I was just a skinny lad
Never knew no good from bad
But I knew life before I left my nursery (Huh)
Left alone with big fat Fanny
She was such a naughty nanny
Big woman, you made a bad boy out of me

Hey, hey-hey-hey, right? Ayy, alright
Fat bottomed girls, go-go-go-go, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I’ve been singing with my band
Across the wire, across the land
I've seen every blue eyed floozy on the way (Hey)
But their beauty and their style
Went kind of smooth after a while
Take me to them dirty ladies every time
Come on

[Chorus]
Are you gonna take me home tonight?
Oh, down beside your red firelight?
Oh, when you give it all you got
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rockin' world go round
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rockin’ world go round

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Now I got mortgages and homes
I got stiffness in my bones
Ain't no beauty queens in this locality
I tell you
Oh, well, I still got my pleasure
Still got my greatest treasure
Big woman, you gon' make a big man of me
Now hear this

[Chorus]
Are you gonna take me home tonight? (Hey)
Oh, down beside your red firelight
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rocking world go round (Yeah)
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rocking world go round

[Outro]
Get on your bikes and ride ...

Ooh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, alright

Fat bottomed girls
One more time, girls
Yeah, yeah
Alright!

They get me, they get me, they get me, they get me, get me, get me, get me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I’ve gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body’s aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody; I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh
I don't want to die
But sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds, invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

[Chorus]
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio, blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

[Verse 2]
We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things, on you, we depend
So, stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio

[Chorus]
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you
Loves
You, oh

[Intro]
Hey hey hey hey, "Hammer to Fall"!

[Verse 1]
Here we stand or here we fall
History don't care at all
Make the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won’t be home tonight

[Chorus]
You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell, but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all, yeah
And it’s time for the hammer to fall

[Verse 2]
Every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the Western Way
Build up...

[Chorus]
Tow your line and play their game
'Til the anesthetic covers it all
'Til one day they call your name
Then it's time for the hammer to fall

[Bridge]
Rich or poor or famous
For your truth is all the same (Oh no, oh no)
Lock your door 'cause rain is pouring
Through your window pane (Oh no)
Baby, now your struggle's all in vain, oh, yeah

[Verse 4]
For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
Just wanna  scream it louder and louder and louder

[Chorus]
What the hell are we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
Just got time to say your prayers
Then it’s time for the hammer to, hammer to fall

[Guitar Solo]
It’s going to fall!

[Outro]
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
One more time
Waiting for the hammer to fall

Give it to me one more time!

[Introductory Verses]
Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world
I’ll turn it inside out, yeah
And floating around in ecstasy, so

Don't stop me now
Don't stop me
’Cause I'm having a good time
Having a good time!

[Main Verse 1]
I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
Like a tiger, defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by
Like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go-go-go
There's no stopping me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah

’Cause I'm having a good time
Don't stop me now
Yes, I'm havin' a good time
I don't wanna stop at all

[Main Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars
On a collision course
I am a satellite; I'm out of control
I am a sex machine ready to reload
Like an atom bomb about to
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode!

[Pre-Bridge, Pre-Chorus melody]
I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah
200 degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm traveling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you

[Bridge]
Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me
Hey, hey, hey!

Ooh, ooh, ooh (I like it!)
Don't stop me, don't stop me
Have a good time, good time
Don't stop me, don't stop me
Ahhhhhh

[Guitar Solo]
Alright!

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
200 degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm traveling at the speed of light
I want to make a supersonic man outta you

[Chorus]
Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time
Just give me a call
Don't stop me now
'Cause I'm having a good time
Don't stop me now
Yes, I'm havin' a good time
I don't wanna stop at all

[Intro]
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

[Verse 1]
Ooh, each morning I get up, I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet (Take a look at yourself)
Take a look in the mirror and cry (In the mirror and cry, yeah, yeah)
Lord, what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord

[Chorus]
Somebody (Somebody)
Ooh, somebody (Somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I work hard (He works hard)
Every day of my life
I work 'til I ache my bones
At the end (At the end of the day)
I take home my hard-earned pay all on my own
(Goes home, goes home on his own)
I get down (Down) on my knees (Knees)
And I start to pray (Praise the Lord)
'Til the tears run down from my eyes, Lord

[Chorus]
Somebody (Somebody)
Ooh, somebody (Please)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

[Bridge]
(He works hard)
Everyday (Everyday)
I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
No, I got no common sense
(He's got) Got nobody left to believe
(No, no, no, no)

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
(Ooh, Lord)
Ooh, somebody
Ooh (Somebody)
Anybody find me somebody to love?

[Verse 3]
Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat (Just keep losing and losing)
I'm okay, I'm alright (He's alright, he's alright)
I ain't gonna face no defeat (Yeah, yeah)
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord

[Outro]

Find me, find me, find me

[Intro]
Yeah
That's right, keep yourself alive
Yeah! Ayy, yeah

[Verse 1]
I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
Might you grow a little wiser, little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers, and I rode a million miles
Still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile

[Verse 2]
Sold a million mirrors in a shop in alleyway
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you, "Be a superstar"
Tell you, just be satisfied, stay right where you are

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people, keep yourself alive
That's right
That's right
Woo!

[Verse 3]
Well I loved a million women in a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need, feed my body and my soul
Grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal

[Verse 4]
Told a million times of all the people in my way
How I'd have to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers, rode a million miles
Still be where I started, same as when I started

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people, keep yourself alive

[Drum Solo to Guitar Solo]

Keep yourself alive, keep yourself alive
Take you on your time and honey, honey, you survive
Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave

Keep yourself alive, keep yourself alive
All you people, keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive, keep yourself alive
All you people, keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive, keep yourself alive (C'mon, c'mon)
All you people, keep yourself alive

(Thank you!)

[Verse 1]
She keeps Moet et Chandon, in her pretty cabinet
"Let them eat cake," she says, just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy for Khrushchev and Kennedy
At anytime an invitation you can't decline
Caviar and cigarettes, well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

[Chorus]
She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

[Verse 2]
To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China, went down to Geisha Minah (A killer, a killer)
Then again incidentally, if you're that way inclined (She's a killer queen)
Perfume came naturally from Paris (Naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less, fastidious and precise

[Chorus]
She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Drop of a hat, she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's all out to get you

[Chorus]
She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

[Outro]
Ooh, recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try? (Wanna try?)

[Intro]
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo) Galileo (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

[Outro]
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows
Here I stand
Look around, around, around, around, around
But you won't see me
Now I'm here
Now I'm there
I'm just a- just a new man
Yes, you made me live again, hey

A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright
The people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight

Whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be
Don't worry baby I'm safe and sound
Down in the dungeon just Peaches 'n' me
Don't love you so
Yes, you made me live again

Yeah
Ooh, a thin moon me in a smoke screen sky
Where the beams of your lovelight chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With the rain running down my face
Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye
Down in the city just Hoople 'n' me
Go Johnny go!

Whatever comes of you and me
I love to leave my memory with you

Now I'm here
Think I'll stay around, around, around, around
Down in the city, just you and me

[Chorus]
This thing called love, I just can't handle it
This thing called love, I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love

[Verse 1]
This thing (This thing)
Called love (Called love)
It cries (Like a baby)
In a cradle all night
It swings (Woo woo)
It jives (Woo woo)
It shakes all over like a jellyfish
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love

[Bridge]
There goes my baby
She knows how to rock 'n' roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat

[Verse 2]
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love

[Verse 3]
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat (Ah hum), hitch-hike (Ah hum)
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready (Ready Freddie)
Crazy little thing called love

[Chorus]
This thing called love, I just can't handle it
This thing called love, I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready (Ooh ooh ooh ooh)

[Outro]
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah

[Crowd]
Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart, and now you leave me
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

[Freddie Mercury & Crowd]
Love of my life, don't leave me
You've stolen my love, you now desert me

[Crowd]
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

[Freddie Mercury]
Obrigado

[Freddie Mercury & Crowd]
You will remember when this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older
I will be there at your side, to remind you
How I still love you
(I still love you, ooh)

[Freddie Mercury]
Ooh, I still love you

[Crowd]
Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian!
Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian!

[Freddie Mercury & Crowd]
Oh, hurry back, hurry back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

[Crowd]
Love of my life
Love of my life

[Crowd & Freddie Mercury]
Ooh, yeah

[Freddie Mercury]
Alright!

[Intro]
Ooh, let's go!

[Verse 1]
Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain’t no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

[Chorus]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

[Verse 2]
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you, when you’re gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Look out

[Chorus]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

[Bridge]
Hey
Oh, take it
Bite the dust, hey
Bites the dust, hey
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust, ow
Another one bites the dust, hey hey
Another one bites the dust, hey-eh-eh
Ooh, shootout

[Verse 3]
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad
And leave him when he's down, yeah
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

[Outro]
Shootout
Ay-yeah
Alright

[Verse 1]
Empty spaces, what are we living for?
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score, on and on
Does anybody know what we are looking for?
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line
Does anybody want to take it anymore?

[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile, still, stays on

[Verse 2]
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance, on and on
Does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free

[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile, still, stays on

[Bridge]
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairy tales of yesterday, grow but never die
I can fly, my friends

[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show

[Verse 3]
I'll top the bill
I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the show
Show must go on
Show must go on
I’m writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on November 6th, in which I’ll be voting in the state of Tennessee. In the past I’ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country. I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG. I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent.

I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love. Running for Senate in the state of Tennessee is a woman named Marsha Blackburn. As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me. She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values. I will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives. Please, please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values. For a lot of us, we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 100% on every issue, but we have to vote anyway.

So many intelligent, thoughtful, self-possessed people have turned 18 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count. But first you need to register, which is quick and easy to do. October 9th is the LAST DAY to register to vote in the state of TN. Go to vote.org and you can find all the info. Happy Voting! 🗳😃🌈

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
So you feel like you ain't nobody?
Like you needed to be somebody?
Put your feet on the ground
Put your hand on your heart
Lift your head to the stars
And the world’s for your taking
('Ey, 'ey)

[Verse 2]
So you feel it’s the end of the story?
Find it all pretty satisfactory?
Well I tell you, my friend
This might seem like the end
But the continuation
Is yours for the making
Cause you're a hero, give it to me!

[Intro]
Drumma Boy

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Trey Songz & Both]
Are you lovin' or what?
Baby, are you lovin’ or what?
Ain't no thing
Are you lovin' or what?
Baby, are you lovin’ or what?
It ain't a thing
Oh babe, baby
Let me know, baby, baby
Are you lovin' or what?
Baby, are you lovin' or what?
Ain't no thing
Are you lovin' or what?
Baby, are you lovin' or what?
It ain't a thing

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
You lookin’ good girl and I won’t let it go to waste
I ain't tryna waste your time, ain’t no time for games
Girl, I know you ready
I'ma ease your mind if you let me
I don't really even know what it is
Girl, maybe we should start with a kiss, baby

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Oh, babe, can't wait another minute
’Til I get my hands on you, babe
Can't wait another second, my hands all over your body
You're like a drug and I can't get enough of it
I'm addicted to your booty, girl, yeah

[Verse 3: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
Oh, too many questions, need answers (Oh)
Your love got all messed up (Oh)
And I don't know what to say to you
So right now, I'll hold your love for ransom (Oh)
Girl, you're just too much to handle (Oh)
All I really need to know from you (Let's get it)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Trey Songz & Both]
Are you lovin' or what? (Baby, are you lovin'?)
Baby, are you lovin' or what? (Lovin', no, no)
Ain't no thing
Are you lovin' or what?
Baby, are you lovin' or what?
It ain't a thing
Oh babe, baby
Let me know, baby, baby
Are you lovin' or what?
Baby, are you lovin' or what?
Ain't no thing
Are you lovin' or what?
Baby, are you lovin' or what?
It ain't a thing
I know the feeling swimming round inside your head
You know the feeling keeping you awake in bed
Something's missing that you can't seem to get right
You can't ignore it, it's really putting up a fight
You can't fake it, a passion you must go and find
You won't make it without it for much more time
But where is it, you've been looking everywhere
It isn't anywhere

Oh no, it may never show itself
Oh no, you may have to go

Below the valleys
Above the mountains
Behind the alleys
Is where it begins
Outside the map is
Where it happens
Where sun won't shine it
Is where you'll find it
You are worried that you won't fulfill yourself
You must find these thoughts back on your furthest shelf
And you wonder how can you complete this life
It's cutting like a knife

Oh no, you just can't be free right here
Oh no, you may have to see

Below the valleys
Above the mountains
Behind the alleys
Is where it begins
Outside the map is
Where it happens
Where sun won't shine it
Is where you'll find it

[Intro]
Oooh
Boy
Yes ah!
Come on!
Give it to me!
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Buddy, you’re a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face, you big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place

[Chorus]
We will, we will rock you tonight
We will, we will rock you

[Verse 2]
Buddy, you’re a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face, you big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place

[Chorus]
We will, we will rock you, sing it
We will, we will rock

[Bridge]
Oh!
Rock you, rock on

Hey, hey
Rock with me

[Chorus]
Oh, we will, we will rock you tonight
We will, we will rock you, rock you, rock you, rock
We will, we will rock
Rock on!

Hello everybody!
Ey hey hey!
Okay
Do you know, it's not very often that we do shows in daylight and I fucking wish we'd done it before and see you all now
And there's some beauty's here tonight, I can tell you

On with the show, this is action

[Verse 1]
Woman
Caught behind those burning eyes
Tangled up in morning white
Do you ever really know?
Can you ever really know?

[Verse 2]
Woman
Watch her take me by surprise
When she lets me call her mine
Do you ever really know?
Can you ever really know?

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know the darkness that you've known
I don't hear the frosty words echo inside
When you're gone again
Just as long again

[Chorus]
I can't read your mind, though I'm trying all the time, oh
There's something I don't know; I can see it in your eyes, oh
But as the night ascends, all will slow again, oh
And I am left in awe of the woman I adore, oh

[Verse 3]
Woman
Smile and say I move too fast
As you join me in our trials
Can you ever really know?
Do you ever really know?

[Verse 4]
Woman
I never had such a sight
Burn itself onto my mind
Do you ever really know?
Can you ever really know?

[Pre-Chorus]
But say the sun doesn't shine for you
I hope you learn that that's not true, in time
I don't know the loneliness you've known
I don't hear the frosty words echo inside
When you're gone again
Just as long again

[Chorus]
I can't read your mind, though I'm trying all the time, oh
There's something I don't know; I can see it in your eyes, oh
But as the night ascends, all will slow again, oh
And I am left in awe of the woman I adore, oh

[Intro]
1, 2, 3

[Verse 1]
All day permanent red
The glaze on my eyes
When I heard your voice
The distance caught me by surprise again

[Verse 2]
And I know you claim
That you're alright
But fix your eyes on me
I guess I'm all you have
And I swear you'll see the dawn again

[Chorus]
Well I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light

[Verse 3]
Relate to my youth
Well I'm still in awe of you
Discover some new truth
That was always wrapped around you

[Verse 4]
But don't just slip away
In the night
Don't just hurl
Your words from on high

[Chorus]
Well I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light

[Bridge]
If we come back and we're broken
Unworthy and ashamed
Give us something to believe in
And you know we'll go your way

[Chorus]
'Cause I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light
And I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light

[Verse 1]
Mortal once again
Making out what's make-pretend
And you whisper words forbidden
To see if I've been listening
Well, now I'm listening

[Verse 2]
We won't both get our way
If we do, it won't be tonight anyway
So I hold you by the jaw
And kiss you to be sure
With so much more than before

[Chorus]
It took a wild heart to tame mine
It took a wild heart to chance
Now a wild heart's gone and floored me
With this everlasting glance
With her everlasting glance

[Post-Chorus]
I wouldn't have you any other way
Who wants a love that makes sense anyway?

[Verse 3]
I guess I asked for the truth
I guess I asked for it, brutal and untuned
But tonight, it sounds improvised
Whatever has you so inspired
Well, I know you're inspired

[Verse 4]
And no one is better armed
To tear me down with a slight of the tongue
And I could do the same
And see how long you can keep face
Let's see you keeping face

[Chorus]
But it took a wild heart to tame mine
And it took a wild heart to chance
Now a wild heart's gone and floored me
With this everlasting glance
With her everlasting glance

[Post-Chorus]
I wouldn't have you any other way
Who wants a love that makes sense anyway?
I wouldn't have you any other way
I don't want a love that makes sense anyway

[Chorus]
But it took a wild heart to tame mine
And it took a wild heart to chance
Now a wild heart's gone and floored me
With this everlasting glance
With her everlasting glance

[Verse 1]
Stepped in the party through the front door
I got a couple little bad bitches with us
You see the bottles, look at 'em shine, baby
I call your girl over, now you got your bitches
You say that I'm playing
But I'm taking that down tonight
And if your friends coming over to party
That means foreplay, ménage

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on ladies, put it on me
Nice and slowly, now speed it up
Go 'head make them sounds
Scream for me, yeah

[Chorus]
That's your girlfriend, yeah, she on deck
Lamborghini Masi', yeah, a nigga gon' flex
She wear my chain, gimme neck
I bang that pussy like I'm throwing up my set
Girl, you freaky
I'ma show 'em how to ride the pony
She freaky
I started busting, it's the champagne

[Verse 2]
Shawty said she fucking with the campaign
I ain't worried 'bout nothing, not a damn thang
Dark Knight Lamborghini, Bruce Wayne
Give a fuck about my old ho, I'm riding 'round in that new thang
Staring at your body, tryna do thangs
Throwing all these hunnids, girl, that's loose change
And do it all for the ladies
Pop it, pop it for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on ladies, put it on me (Ayy)
Nice and slowly, now speed it up (Ooh)

Picture me rollin', 100 bad bitches, that pussy is soakin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on ladies, put it on me
Nice and slowly, now speed it up
Go 'head make them sounds
Scream for me, yeah

[Chorus]
That's your girlfriend, yeah, she on deck

Once upon a month
I used to be a lover in love with you
Now I'm in chains

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, I'm just here
And I'm happier than you could ever imagine
Now, I'm here
And I'm happy for being a dreamer

Hey
Nobody told me it would be like this
Hey
Something's gotta be like this

[Chorus]
Nothing getting better and nothing ever changes
Had a bad day all week, but I guess you knew about it
Nothing's getting better and nothing ever changes
Had a bad day all week
Had a bad day all week
Ah-ah-ah-oh

Now, I'm here
And I happy for being a dreamer

Hey
Some things will never be the same
Hey
I'm sick and tired of your singing, singing

[Chorus]
Nothing's getting better and nothing ever changes
Had a bad day all week, but I guess you knew about it
Nothing's getting better and nothing ever changes
Had a bad day all week
Had a bad day all week
Ah-ah-ah-oh

Nothing's getting better and nothing ever changes
Had a bad day all week, but I guess you knew about it
Nothing's getting better and nothing ever changes
Had a bad day all week
Had a bad day all week

Ah-ah-ah-oh

[Verse 1]
You'd rather speak more than listen
And that's based off our first impression
I'm new to all this affection
But I'm going in the right direction
Floating through different dimensions
But not losing sense of religion
Honey, I forgot to mention
I'm so entranced by you, it hurts

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'
I'm in love with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'

[Verse 2]
Can't let me go if I'm fallin'
I've been on the path of importance
Let the love pull you in slowly
The river is running, we're flowing
I'm coming down, you've been rollin'
And we're letting free, now we're open
Pour me a, pour me a potion
I'm rocking, I'm rocking the motion

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'
I'm in love with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'

[Outro]
Nothing feels better than this
Now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like that, like that, ayy
Ooh, now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like
Nothing feels better than this
Now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like that, like that, ayy
Ooh, now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like
Nothing feels better than this

That made me feel like I'm just speeding, doing 60 in a 35
We're sitting in a car and just holding hands
Now I’ve been extremely patient and made it a point to not jump to any premature conclusions about Ye’ & his antics... Partially due to the lessons learned from the outcome of other similar situations dealing wit my brother Wayne (which I admittedly mishandled a bit in hindsight) But now this shit is next level,futuristic Sambo,Hopping Bob, Stephen off Django ass shit Ye!!!!

From what I can gather... This is the most repulsive,disgraceful,
Embarrassing act of desperation & auctioning off of one’s soul to gain power I’ve ever seen. Now I recall you asking me to come with you to have this meeting and I declined (naturally)... but bro... if ain’time I would’ve been in there wit you and you behaved that spinelessly in my presence,I feel that I’d be compelled to slap de’Fuq outta you bro For the People!!! You ass kissing and boot licking on a whole new level &I refuse to associate myself with something so vile,weak,& inconsiderate to the effect this has on the greater good of ALL OUR PEOPLE!!!! I’m a true believer in “It ain’t what you do,it’s how you do it.” And this shit is regurgitating🤮! At one time it was a pleasure to work alongside you... now, I’m ashamed to have ever been associated with you.

To all the people who follow Ye musically,socially, or even personally....who are confused, heartbroken, infuriated.... Let me make this clear... THIS SHIT AINT COOL!!! THIS IS A MOVE YE MADE FOR YE!!! THIS IS A PLAY TO PUT HIM IN A POSITION HE’D LIKE TO SEE HIMSELF IN...WE ARE NOT ON HIS MIND AS HE MAKES THESE COMMENTS AND DECISIONS. Don’t follow this puppet. Because as long as I’ve lived I’ve learned that it benefits a man nothing at all to gain the world,if to do so he must lose his soul. We just saw Mr.West’s Soul on auction. If you listen closely you can hear the tears of our ancestors hit the floor. All I can say is... I’ve reached my limits. This is my stop,I’m officially DONE!!!! 🖕🏽Trump & His Lil Cookie Boy. #USorELSE✊🏽

Don't go creepin' if ya got a iPhone
She tracked ya location and ya ass wasn't home
Yeah, I told the bitch like I told Nike: Yeezy's on yo' ass
Told that nigga get from and from my car
My Yeezy's on the gas
And last thing I need is involuntary manslaughter
'Cause I ain't finna let no lame nigga raise my daughter
Stop asking me that dumb shit; do you have a Samsung charger?
You see me spending that Gualla
We stay spending that Gualla 'til you love me
Thirsty bitch, keep sippin' that water 'till you love me
Do you love me?
I got caught up with the strippers, I got caught up in the fame
Caught up on MediaTakeOut
Don't know how much more I could take
I got caught up in the pictures, they blurry enough I could fake
I can tell my girl it wasn't me, I was in a meeting with Jay

[Bridge: Tyga]
But today, I don't have any plans
Rap God in a minivan
Usher say I got it bad, yo, really bad
Does anybody have any 'Xans?

[Verse 2: Tyga]
'Cause you don't know these rich-nigga problems
You niggas got bitch-nigga problems
Too many hoes on my dick; yeah, I got big dick nigga problems
If she hack my phone, that's dick pic nigga problems
That's when she ask, "Who the fuck is Tonya?"
Nigga, you must be fucking Tonya
Sometimes I do shit to prove I don't need nothin' from 'em
Sometimes I make 'em hate me just to prove I can make 'em love me again
I could make you love me again
I'll make y'all love me
I feel like a new artist up in this bitch
Like I'm really starving up in this bitch
If you don't wanna hear my mouth, don't get me started up in this bitch
Every time I throw up my diamond, see it's flawless up in this bitch
Screaming south-southside, goin' retarded up in this bitch
See T-Raww up in this bitch
Yeah, see Yeezus back on his shit
They say damn Ye, please come back
We need more of the platinum hits
Bitch my new boot killed that Timberland
My niggas don't remember them
I'm the dark chocolate Eminem
I'ma make you love me

[Verse 3: Kanye West & Tyga (both)]
You see love and hate's a similar emotion
Opposite of love is the difference
That's when motherfuckers don't care about you no more
I'd rather be hated and loved than be not cared about
Rrrrra, rrrrrrra, get these motherfuckers out
See I immediately took the media
See I immediately took the media
And made it what it mean to me
I control this shit, I control the puppet strings
I am in charge of the narrative
So don't ever compare this shit
As I air this shit out, a modern day Ali
For anybody that wanna try me, see
All I ever wanted to do was take the whole time on TV and give an eleven-minute speech
They wish I would perform for these niggas
Dance. nigga. dance, dance, nigga, dance, dance, nigga, dance
I been dancing too long and y'all motherfuckers money been getting too strong
If I hear another motherfucker I put on made a million dollars a day (uh, yeah, yeah)
(I'm your only hope, I'ma make you love me, yeah)
If I hear another motherfucker I put on made a million muhfuckin' dollars a day (uh, yeah, yeah)
(Them boys just don't know, I'ma make you love me, yeah)
(Hit me on my phone, I can't hear them other girls 'cause I got them hoes on hold)
If I say, I say (I'ma make you love me, yeah, yeah-yeah)
I'ma make you love me (yeah, yeah-yeah)
I'ma make you love me (yeah, yeah-yeah)
You never stopped loving me, did you?
(I'ma make you love me, yeah)
You never stopped loving me. did you?

[Verse 1]
Cinnamon in my teeth
From your kiss, you're touching me
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work
You try to push me out, but I just find my way back in
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me out, I win

[Chorus]
There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did

[Verse 2]
Kerosene in my hands
You make me mad, on fire again
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work

[Chorus]
There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did

[Chorus]
There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

[Chorus]
I fell asleep with the lights on last night
I had a dream I was swervin' in the fast life
And all I think about is oblivion
And all I really want is a million

[Verse 1]
I don't need to redemption, your complexion made me lose direction
I lost all reception wifi, wifi need inspection
This a warning, man I might just get reckless
What a rush, man I might just get arrested
I might just go on the top just to fuck with this girl
All this time invested, better hope I rest up
I might just get invested for a million, damn like all the fucking time
I don't need a knife, nigga
I just need the money
Oh, she is so fine, I just told myself "Why the fuck you gotta hide?"
Cause I got all this pain, nigga
I don't need to die, why I gotta lie
Fight for what is mine
I just wait on line and I just waste my time
Can you give me a sign? What you see by night?
But, but (Oh)
Why you only get with me when I get numb?
And why you always back when you say you're dumb?
And why you only coming when you lost my love?
You hit my line like we gotta talk about sumn, though
You know, oh well
You like these robes
Top flow, you suck
I'm on, you suck
But fuck it, memories fade
I'll just wait on the day when you hit my line with a "hey"
Got something to say
I made a mistake, I thought that I needed a break
Don't matter to me, I just wanna get paid
That fun in the sun, just to play in the shade

[Chorus]
I fell asleep with the lights on last night
I had a dream I was swervin' in the fast life
And all I think about is oblivion
And all I really want is a million

[Verse 2]
I sent a message and I hope you comprehend it, every
Word yes, I meant it
But that room in the city that you rented
Get your money back, please don't feel offended
I know it's a lot of time that we invested
I kinda feel infested, I think we should rest it
So maybe we could miss it
I'll hit you on Thanksgiving, you'll say "how's life ?"
I'll say "Thank god we living on the underground"
Buried, hidden, where exposure is forbidden
And I'm sitting on this pedestal, where all my sins are written
I ran in for the killin', oh well now we winnin'
Cause I'm from a world where your mind counts, not your body counts
Search my soul, take a look around
Tell me what you found, my eyes they yelling love
You can ring my phone, I don't need to know
Tell me if you down, we can smoke a pound
I am not a child, we can do this ting
We can do a lot, I don't need a 

[?]
We could go so high, I don't need to see
Cause I'll never think like the person I used to be
And we never leaving, we follow the same routine, same routine

[Chorus]
I fell asleep with the lights on last night
I had a dream I was swervin' in the fast life
And all I think about is oblivion
And all I really want is a million

[Outro]
Everybody got a dream, everybody want to see
Death is there
She said "The world's gonna die."
"You know, the world, the earth."
"Its gonna be over"
And he said "well I never lied to you"
You see I could explain sex in a minute but death I can't explain

Wanting to die
Since you ask, most days I cannot remember
I walk in my clothing, unmarked by that voyage
Then the almost unnameable lust returns
Even then I have nothing against life
I know well the grass blades you mention, the furniture you have placed under the sun
But suicides have a  special language, like carpenters, they want to know which tools, they never ask 'why build?'

Twice I have so simply declared myself
Have possessed the enemy, eaten the enemy
Have taken on his craft, his magic
In this way, heavy and thoughtful, warmer than oil or water
I have rested drooling at the mouth-hole
I did not think of my body at needle point
Even the cornea and the left over urine were gone
Suicides have already betrayed the body
Still-born, they don't always die, but dazzled, they can't forget a drug so sweet that even children would look on and smile
To thrust all that life under your tongue
That, all by itself, becomes a passion
Death's a sad bone; bruised, you'd say
And yet she waits for me, year after year
To so delicately undo an old wound
To empty my breath from its bad prison
Balanced there
Suicides sometimes meet
Raging at the fruit, a pumped up moon
Leaving the bread they mistook for a kiss
Leaving the page of the book carelessly open
Something unsaid, the phone off the hook
And the love, whatever it was, an infection

[Intro]
Slime
It's another one
Udigg?
Uhh
Yeah
Jeffery!
Hah

[Chorus]
Fuck nigga playin' 'round, young nigga hopped out and went ran down on 'em

Intro:
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me, are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me, then I'm reaching out for you

[Verse 1]
I'm just so (Intro echos) depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick that mic back up
I don't know how or when
And I ended up in this position I'm in
I starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and tried to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips
With the fact that
I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
I know some spits so hard to swallow
And I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
Copy
One tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you have to walk a thousand miles

[Pre-Chorus 1]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's be like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what I'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at it through each other's eyes

[Chorus 1]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, o-o-o-o-h
They can all get..... Just stay true to you, so-o-o-o-oh
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, o-o-o-o-h
They can all get..... Just stay true to you, so-o-o-o-oh

[Verse 2]
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything is so tense and gloom I
Almost feel like I gotta check the temperature at a room
Just as soon
As I walk in
It's like all eyes on me, so I try to avoid any eye contact
Cause if I do that then it opens a door to conversation, like I want that
I'm not looking for extra attention
I just want to be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no... manservant
Follow me around, and wipe my (instrumental)
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny like
Haah Marshall, you're so funny man, you should be a comedian
G--damn
Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't have to trade our shoes
And you don't have to walk no thousand miles

[Pre-Chorus 2]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's be like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what I'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at it through each other's eyes

[Chorus 2]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, o-o-o-o-h
They can all get..... Just stay true to you, so-o-o-o-oh
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, o-o-o-o-h
They can all get..... Just stay true to you, so-o-o-o-oh

Outro:
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me, are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me, then I'm reaching out for you

[Intro]
Action
Hey!

[Verse 1]
This street honey is a mean street
Living in this street honey needs a mean streak
We've got criminals living in this street

[Refrain]
You got a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I gotta feeling, this world is using me

[Verse 2]
This town honey is a dead town
Living in this town honey is a let-down
Coming to this town honey is a showdown

[Refrain]
You got a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Some sunshine ray through a crack in a shutter
Or a sight of a light at the end of a tunnel
I gotta feeling that just won’t quit, this world is using me

[Chorus]
Action this day
Action this night
Oh, you’ve got the power to know, to live
You can't say it ain't right
Action this day
Action this night
Oh, you've got the power, you've got the power
You've got the power to know and to live
You can't say it ain't right

[Verse 3]
Your mind honey is a bleak place
Living in your mind honey, in a blank space
Your mind is coming from a rat race

[Refrain]
You got a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I gotta feeling that just won't quit, this world is using me

[Chorus]
Action this day, yeah
Action this night
Ooh, you’ve got the power to know and to live
You can't say it ain't right
Action this day, yeah
Action this night
Ooh, you've got the power, you've got the power
You've got the power to know and to live
You can't say it ain't right
Hey!

[Keytar Solo]

[Bridge]
Action

Living in this street, living in a mean street
This street, this street
You know I want action (Oh)

All day

[Bridge]
Oh baby

And the people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight

Whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be
Don't worry, baby, I'm safe and sound
Down in the dungeon, just Peaches and me
Don't I love her so
Yes, she made me live again!

[Verse 4]
A thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where the beams of your love-light chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With a rain running down my face

Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye
Down in the city, just Hoople and me

[Audience Cheering]

[Spoken Word: Brian May]
I'd just like to dedicate this next one... This is a little unusual. But um...

[Spoken Word: Audience Member]
Just fucking play it!

[Spoken Word: Brian May]
The thing is we're not playing our song of peace tonight. I'd like to say um... I'd like to dedicate this uh particular song to all those people who are not like us, and sitting here and having a good time... listening to music, but um... But no matter where they've come from, people have given up their lives to what they believe

[Audience Applause]

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart, and now you leave me

[Pre-Chorus: Audience]
Love of my life, can't you see?

[Chorus: Audience]
Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

[Verse 2]
Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love, you now desert me

[Pre-Chorus]
Love of my life can't you see?

[Chorus]
Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

You will remember, when this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older, I will be there at your side, to remind you
How I still love you, I still love you

[Spoken Word]
I still love you
Don't you forget it

[Audience Cheering]

[Acoustic Guitar Interlude]

Oh, hurry back, please bring it back home to me
Because you don't know what it means to me

[Outro: Freddie Mercury & Audience ]
Love of my life
Love of my life
Oooh yeah

[Audience Applause]

[Piano Intro]

[Verse 1]
It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you
How I cried
The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham it seems
The years belie, we lived a lie
I love you 'til I die

[Chorus]
Save me, save me, save me
I can’t face this life alone
Save me, save me, oh
I am naked and I am far from home

[Verse 2]
The slate will soon be clean
I'll erase the memories
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted
All that love
I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart, I am cold inside
I have no real intent

[Chorus]
Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, oh
I am naked and I am far from home

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Bridge]
Each night I cry, I still believe the lie
I love you ’til I die
Yes sir!

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro/Chorus]
Save me, save me, save me
Don't make me face this life alone
Save me, save me, oh
I am naked and I am far from home

[Audience Applause]

[Spoken Word: Freddie Mercury]
Hey, clap
This is a, this is a song by John
It's called back chat, back chat, back chat, back chat, back chat, back...

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah
Ha!

[Chorus]
Back Chat, Back Chat
You burn all my energy
Back Chat, Back Chat
Criticizing all you see
Back Chat, Back Chat
Analyzing what I say
Back Chat, Back Chat
And you always get your way

[Post-Chorus]
Oh yeah, see it baby
See what you've done

[Bridge]
Back Chat, Back Chat
You're driving me insane
It's a battle to the end, knock me down
You come again

[Verse 1]
Talk back, talk back you've got me on the rack
Twisting every word I say
Wind me up and get your way
Fat chance I have of making a romance
If I'm ever gonna win
Have to get the last word in
Take it from there
Twisting every word I say
Wind me up and let me play

[Chorus]
Back Chat, Back Chat
You burn all my energy
Back Chat, Back Chat
Criticizing all you see
Back Chat, Back Chat
Analyzing what I say
Back Chat, Back Chat
And you always get your way

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Wake up, stand up, and drag yourself on out
Get down, get ready
Scream and shout
Back off of me, be cool
And learn to change your ways
'Cause your talking in your sleep
And your walking in a daze
Don't push your luck with me
I'm ready to attack
'Cause when I'm tryna talk to you, all you do is just talk back
You stand so tall you don't flatter me at all
Don't talk back, don't talk back, don't talk back
Just leave me alone

[Chorus]
Back Chat, Back Chat
You burn all my energy
Back Chat, Back Chat
Criticizing all you see
Back Chat, Back Chat
Analyzing what I say
Back Chat, Back Chat
You always get your way
Yes you do baby
Ah! Go, yeah
Get on down
Oh, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Oh!
Talk to me, talk to me
Yes you do, yes you do baby
Oh, right on down, yeah
Whoo!
Oh, get on down
Get on down, get on down
Hey!
Get on down, get on down
Back chat, back, c'mon
Back, back, back, back, back, back chat
Hey, get on down, get on down
Go for it, go for it, go for it, yeah
Take it, whoo!
Back Chat

[Audience Applause]

[Audience Cheering]

[Chorus 1]
Get down make love
Get down make love
Get down make love
Get down make love

[Verse 1]
You take my body
I give you heat
You say you hungry
I give you meat
I suck your mind
You blow my head
Make love
Inside your bed
Everybody

[Chorus 1]
Get down make love
Get down make love
Get down make love
Get down make love

[Chorus 2]
Every time I get high
You say you want to come down
Every time I get hot
You want to cool down
You say it's enough
In fact, it’s too much
Every time I wanna
Get down, get down
Get down

[Interlude/Outro]

[Intro]
Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh

[Verse 1]
Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

[Bridge: Freddie Mercury]
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da- that's okay

[Chorus]
It’s the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out!"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

[Verse 2]
Day day de
Day day de de de
(Okay)
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
Ee do ba be
Ee da ba ba ba
De do da
De dap
People on streets
Ee da de da de
People on streets
Ee da de da de da de da

[Chorus]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, high
Pressure on people, people on streets

[Bridge]
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it’s so slashed and torn
Why, why, why?
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

[Verse 3]
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

[Outro]
Because love's such an old-fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure

[Audience Cheering]

[Spoken Word: Freddie Mercury & Roger Taylor]
I've got three words to say
Fat bottomed girls!

Are you gonna take me home tonight?
Oh down beside that red firelight?
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rockin’ world go round

[Verse 1]
I was just a skinny lad
Never knew no good from bad
But I knew life before I left my nursery (Ho!)
Left alone with big fat fanny
She was such a naughty nanny
Hey, big woman, you made an asshole out of me

[Verse 2]
I've been singing with my band
Across the wire, across the land
I've seen every blue-eyed floozy on the way
But their beauty and their style
Went kind of smooth after a while
Take me to them lardy ladies every time
Come on

[Chorus]
Oh won’t you take me home tonight
Oh down beside your red firelight?
Oh and you give it all you got
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go round
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go round

Oh, but I still get my treasure
Still got my greatest pleasure
Hey big woman you gonna make a big man of me
Now get this

[Chorus]
Are you gonna take me home tonight?
Oh, down beside that red firelight?
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls

There goes my baby
She knows how to rock 'n' roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat

Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love

[Guitar Solo]

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I’ve gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body’s aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo. (Galileo) Galileo. Galileo Figaro magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

[Guitar Solo]

Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows

Oh, yeah!

Get your party gown
Get your pigtail down
Get your heart beating baby
Got my timing right
Got my act all tight
It's got to be tonight
My little school babe
Your momma says you don't
And your daddy said he won't
And I'm boiling up inside
There is no way I'm going to lose out this time
Hey!

[Chorus]
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Lock your daddy out of doors
I don't need him nosing around
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight

[Verse 2]
You're such a dirty louse
Go get out of my house
That's all I ever get from you
And your family ties, in fact I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word
From you guys
But you know I don't give a light
I'm going to make out all right
I've got a sweetheart hand
To put a stop to all that
Shouting and fighting all night

[Chorus]
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Send your brother swimming with a brick
That's alright
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
She ain’t ain't no friend of mine!
Ain’t no friend of mine

[Guitar Solo]

Your momma and your daddy going to
Plague me until I die
Why can't they understand I'm just a
Peace loving guy

[Verse 1]
Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?
Are you standing on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets shreddin’
To the sound of the beat, yeah

[Chorus]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
Ha, ha
Ay, ay

[Verse 2]
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Hey, hey-a, hey-a

[Chorus]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too

There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad
And leave him when he's down, yeah
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating the sound of the beat
Oh yeah

[Chorus: Freddie Mercury & (Audience)]
Another one bites the dust
Your turn
(Another one bites the dust)
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

[Outro]
Shoot out, shoot out, shoot out
A-hey, hey, hey
Alright, alright
Ay, yeah

[Audience Applause]

[Audience Cheering]

[Verse 1]
Well you're just 17 and all you want to do is disappear
You know what I mean there's a lot of space between your ears
The way that you touch don't feel nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, it was the DNA
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that made me this way
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?

[Chorus]
Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac

[Verse 2]
I feel so inar-nar-nar-nar-ticulate
Gotta feeling, got to feeling, got to feeling, like I'm paralyzed
It isn’t no, it isn’t no, it isn’t no, it isn’t no surprise
Turn on the TV let it drip right down in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, it was the DNA
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that made me this way
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?

[Instrumental Inerlude]
Hey!
I bet you that you feel
I bet you that you feel alright
Oh, yeah
I bet you that you feel
I bet you that you feel alright, alright

[Outro]
Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac

[Audience Applause]

[Audience Cheering]

[Verse 1]
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers 'cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Verse 2]
I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose
(And I need just go on and on, and on, and on)

[Outro/Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers 'cause we are the champions
(Of the world)
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
Oh, we are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers 'cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Audience Applause]

[Intro: Freddie Mercury]

[Audience Cheering]
Thank you, good night people!
Thank you, you're very special!
Thank you for staying with us these last ten years, hey!
We appreciate it!

[Crowd sings "United Kingdom National Anthem"]
Send her victorious
Happy and glorious
Long to reign over us
God save the Queen

[Outro: Freddie Mercury]
Goodnight, God bless ya!

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
It don't matter if we're out under New York lights
Or taking in the scene on Ocean Drive
Or standing underneath that Hollywood sign
In California
I always seem to miss it all
I can't focus, I get lost
And I think you know it's all your fault
Now baby, don't ya?

[Chorus]
You end up winning, baby
I can't just take one look
Everything around you fades to black
And just like that, I'm hooked
Girl, you don't need stilettos
To turn them heads around
You ain't gotta worry 'bout getting lost in no crowd
Oh, baby, you're a stand out (you know I get so elevated)
Oh, there ain't no doubt (you ain't routine, so far from basic)

[Verse 2]
I wanna find a club and wanna show you off
When we roll in it won't take long
Every guy with a girl, yeah, they gonna take caught
Looking
And I can't blame 'em
And girl you look famous
If I was in their shoes
I'd do the same, 'cause...

[Chorus]
You end up winning, baby
I can't just take one look
Everything around you fades to black
And just like that, I'm hooked
Girl, you don't need stilettos
To turn them heads around
You ain't gotta worry 'bout getting lost in a crowd
Oh, baby, you're a stand out (you know I get so elevated)
Oh, there ain't no doubt (you ain't routine, so far from basic)

[Bridge]
I always seem to miss it all, yeah
I can't focus, I get lost

[Chorus]
You end up winning, baby
I can't just take one look
Everything around you fades to black
And just like that, I'm hooked
Girl, you don't need stilettos
To turn them heads around
You ain't gotta worry 'bout getting lost in no crowd
Oh, baby, you're a stand out (you know I get so elevated)
Oh, there ain't no doubt (you ain't routine, so far from basic)
You're such a stand out (you know I get so elevated)
Oh, there ain't no doubt (you ain't routine, so far from basic)

[Verse 1]
I think I'm past the point of calling you a bad habit
Ain't trying to get no sympathy, oh, sounds tragic
But it's hard for me to hide your side effects from showing
You strike the match and I burn the lanterns, embers glowing

[Pre-Chorus]
I know the first step is just to admit it
But what if I don't want to quit it
I just keep...

[Chorus]
Chain smokin' your love like a pack of Lucky Strikes
Like binge drinking old fashion cherry in the ice
Push a button, watch the needle dropping in the groove
I can't stop chain, chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you

[Verse 2]
I got a couple hit or miss tricks that I use for distraction
But as soon I slow down and I start flash-backing
To the night before when I was buzzing harder than that storefront neon
Yeah, if your kiss gets me this high, oh I wouldn't mind just keep on

[Chorus]
Chain smokin' your love like a pack of Lucky Strikes
Like binge drinking old fashion cherry in the ice
Push a button, watch the needle dropping in the groove
I can't stop chain, chain smokin' you

[Bridge]
Need a little rush from your touch
Little late night pick me up
When you make me come unwound
Why I can't put you down
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you

[Pre-Chorus]
I know the first step is just to admit it
But what if I don't want to quit it
I just keep...

[Chorus]
Chain smokin' your love like a pack of Lucky Strikes
Like binge drinking old fashion cherry in the ice
Push a button, watch the needle dropping in the groove
I can't stop chain, chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you
Chain smokin' you
No, no, no, no

[Intro]
And I need you, boo
I gotta see you, boo
And there's hearts all over the world tonight
Said there’s hearts all over the world tonight
And I need you, boo, oh
I gotta see you, boo, hey
And there's hearts all over the world tonight
Said there's hearts all over the world tonight

[Verse 1]
Hey little mama, oh you’re a stunner
Hot little figure, yes you're a winner
And I'm so glad to be yours
You are a class all your own
And oh little cutie, when you talk to me
I swear the whole world stops, you're my sweetheart
And I'm so glad that you're mine
You are one of a kind and

[Pre-Chorus]
You mean to me what I mean to you
And together, baby there is nothing we won't do
Cause if I got you, I don't need money, I don’t need cars
Girl, you’re my all and

[Chorus]
Oh I'm into you
And girl, no one else would do
Cause with every kiss and every hug
You make me fall in love
And now I know I can’t be the only one
I bet there's hearts all over the world tonight
With the love of their life who feels
What I feel when I'm
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you, girl
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you

[Verse 2]
Oh girl, I don't want nobody else
Without you, there’s no one left then
You're like Jordans on Saturday
I gotta have you and I cannot wait now
Hey, little shawty, say you care for me
You know I care for you, you know that I'll be true
You know that I won't lie, you know that I would try
To be your everything, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause if I got you, I don't need money, I don't need cars
Girl, you're my all and

[Chorus]
Oh I'm into you
And girl, no one else would do
Cause with every kiss and every hug
You make me fall in love
And now I know I can't be the only one
I bet there's hearts all over the world tonight
With the love of their life who feels
What I feel when I'm
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you, oh
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you, hey

[Verse 1]
You were my sun
You were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance
And made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no

[Bridge]
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?

[Chorus]
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse
You must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn, to cry
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river

[Verse 2]
You know that they say some things are better left unsaid
It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
Don't act like you don't know it
And all of these things people told me
Keep messin' with my head (messin' with my head)
Should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it

[Bridge]
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?

[Chorus]
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone

[Intro]
Mmm, mmm, yeah
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do-do
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
'Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
'Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore
(It's ridiculous)
It's been months
And for some reason I just (can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this (enough is enough)
No more walking round
With my head down
I'm so over being blue
Crying over you

[Hook]
And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

[Verse 2]
Gotta fix that calendar I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be
That's the reason

[Hook]
And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

[Bridge]
(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone
(Stupid love songs)
Don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
I'm letting go
Turning off the radio

[Outro]
Yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Spent 24 hours, I need more hours with you
You spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent the late nights making things right between us

[Refrain: Adam Levine]
But now it's all good, babe
Roll that backwood, babe
And play me close

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
Till sundown when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah

[Refrain: Adam Levine]
But now it's all good, babe
Roll that backwood, babe
And play me close

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
Maybe it's six forty-five
Maybe I'm barely alive
Maybe you've taken my shit for the last time, yeah
Maybe I know that I'm drunk
Maybe I know you're the one
Maybe I'm thinking it's better if you drive
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Till sundown when i come through
I need a girl like you yeah yeah

[Verse 3: Cardi B]
Not too long ago, I was dancing for dollars (eeoow)
Know it's really real if I let you meet my mama (eeoow)
You don't want a girl like me, I'm too crazy
But every other girl you meet is fugazi (okurrrt)
I'm sure them other girls were nice enough
But you need someone to spice it up
So who you gonna call? Cardi, Cardi
Come and rev it up like a Harley, Harley
Why is the best fruit always forbidden?
I'm coming to you now doin' 20 over the limit
The red light, red light stop, stop (skrrt)
I don't play when it comes to my heart, let's get it though
I don't really want a white horse and a carriage
I'm thinkin' more a white Porsches and carats
I need you right here 'cause every time you're far
I play with this kitty like you play wit' your guitar (ah)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
Till sundown when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you

[Verse 1]
Just another microcosm somewhere in the ether
Putting the world to rights with Bing Crosby eyes
Oversharing and its bitter aftertaste
Exactly the wrong time in exactly the wrong place
Save it for a rainy day
Baby, you go hard in the paint
It's just another race to anyways

[Verse 2]
Philanthropic toga party
What a place for both the opposite sides of my double life to finally collide
Sharing secrets I was taking to the grave
Nosebleeds from epiphanies I took full in the face
Oh, come all by the fire, babe, let’s all participate
In yet another race to anyways
Oh, how's your Mum and Dad been doing with the generation gap?

[Bridge]
Yeah, I'm behind my movie camera
I’ve got my megaphone
You can call me Alexander
It's nice to meet you all

[Verse 3]
Listening to the Shipping Forecast
Driving to the airport
Me and the guys
Metropolis ablaze in the rear view
Devising methods to both have and eat your cake
Mmm, just like the ones that Mother Nature used to bake
You look as if you know exactly what I'm gonna say
It's just another race to
Anyways

[Audience Cheering]

[Verse 1]
Buddy, you’re a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday
Mud on your face, big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs & Audience]
We will, we will rock you
Yeah, give it to me!
We will, we will rock you

[Verse 2]
Buddy, you’re a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face, you big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs & Audience]
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Buddy, you’re an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes, gonna make you some peace someday
Mud on your face, big disgrace
Somebody better put you back into your place

[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs & Audience]
We will, we will rock you
Yeah, give it to me!
We will, we will rock you

We will, we will rock you (Yeah, yeah)
We will, we will rock you

[Guitar Solo/Outro]

[Audience Applause]

[Verse]
When did it get so hard?
Can't find no love in light or dark
When did I get so shy?
To risk it all I'd rather die
Wait for you to make your move
Give me the time I'll make mine too
See you dancing all night
I would dance too if the song was right

[Chorus]
Come on now baby
I'm going crazy
I'm so impatient
You know that I am
Come on now baby
My body is aching
Come on now shake me
You know that I'm a fool

[Verse]
When did it get so hard?
Can't find no love in light or dark
When did I get so shy?
To risk it all I'd rather die (Mmm, yeah)
All of the eyes stuck on you
Those eyes are different than these two
I see you move but my legs sit still
I'd rather drink than fake to feel

[Chorus]
Come on now baby
I'm going crazy
I'm so impatient
You know that I am
Come on now baby
My body is aching
Come on now shake me
You know that I'm a fool

I ain't givin' clout (Nope), I ain't givin' clout (Nope)
Lick that pussy 'til it's squirtin' like a sprinkler spout
Fuck her once, then I took her to the In-N-Out
Bitch, I'm all about the gang, ain't no signin' out
Yeah, we vibin' out, and they ridin' out
Bet you say the wrong thing, then we wildin' out

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Runnin' up bands, got my guap up

Me and Boat got kicked out the yacht club

[Verse: Lil Yachty & Juice WRLD]
Ayy, ayy, air it out
Pull up at your spot, and I air it out
Gang on the gas and it's very loud
Stop sayin' my name before you wear it out
I been sippin' lean, tryna slow me down
I need me a bitch that'll hold me down
Gang comin' strong, yeah we rollin' out
Throw a party like Rollin' Loud
Ayy, don't come unless she stay in focus
Soldiers at 10-4, sent your bitch the info
Feelin' real blessed with Juice, that's my kinfolk
Bless up, she tell me I'm a god, get on her knees for confession
Sent a vid to her nigga, had to teach a lesson
Me and Boat only want bad hoes in our section
Juice, why these pussy ass niggas always pressin'?
I don't know, let 'em talk, I'ma go get my Smith & Wesson
Blessed boys under 21, steady flexin'
I'm gettin' too rich, can't do flights with connections
.40 on my hip, I won't fight, bitch I'm reckless
Codeine what I sip, that shit come in straight from Texas
Reach for my chain, you'll get beat just like Nexus
Lamborghini dreams, but you still drive a Lexus
I'm a young king, I might fuck Alexis Texas
But I ain't on no Drake shit, I won't get her pregnant
Damn, young Juice WRLD, boy, you reckless
And I feel you, until I get her naked
When I get up in it, I might have to stay in
Well if she goin' like that, let's run a train then
Fuck, I think I nutted in her, I might need a playpen
And a stroller
How I get this deep? We rode her like a Rover
No games, but I XBOX control her
She do the gang like a nerd doin' homework
.40 in my pants, that bitch thought it was a boner
If I go broke, I'ma juug off Motorolas
But now I'm up in France, Lil Boat, that's my mans
We get the green and then we fly around like Peter Pan
That's cool, but I just thought 'bout somethin', wait
(What?)
This baby got your face
So fuck that lil' baby, boy's back to the place
Back to the trap, back to the gang

[Chorus: Juice WRLD & Lil Yachty]
Runnin' up bands, got my guap up (Runnin' the guap up)

She don't think she worth it
In the mirror, she don't think she perfect
Late night on the net, she be surfin'

You is still a 10, let me come in

[Verse]
Why would you wanna bring somethin' between us?
There's nothin' between us
There's nothin'
You're the reason
You're the reason that I choose to be distant
You're the reason, I know that you miss him
It's too late, I don't feel love
And to move
And the reason you do
Even though the baby is mine
You will never win my love, no
You will never win my love, no, no
Even if the baby is mine
You will never win my love, no
You will never win my love, no
Even if she needs my love, you'll never be sure, no
Oh no, not in love, not in love, no
You would seem real lonely
No reason, oh
No reason, no
Even if the baby is mine
You will never win my love, no
You will never get my love, no, no
Everything you worked on for love
You will never get my love, no
You will never get my love, no, no, no, no, baby
Beef, what a relief
When will this poisonous product cease?
This is another Public Service Announcement
You can believe it or you can doubt it
Let us begin now with the cow
The way it gets to your plate and how
The cow doesn't grow fast enough for man
So through his greed he makes a faster plan
He has drugs to make the cow grow quicker
Through the stress the cow gets sicker
Twenty one different drugs are pumped
Into the cow in one big lump
So just before it dies, it cries
In the slaughterhouse full of germs and flies
Off with the head, they pack it, drain it, and cart it
And there it is, in your local supermarket
Red and bloody, a corpse, neatly packed
And you wonder about heart attacks?
Come on now man let's be for real
You are what you eat is the way I feel
But, the Food and Drug Administration
Will tell you meat is the perfect combination
See cows live under fear and stress
Trying to think what's gonna happen next
Fear and stress can become a part of you
In your cells and blood, this is true
So when the cow is killed, believe it
You preserve those cells, you freeze it
Thaw it out with the blood and season it
Then you sit down and begin eatin it
In your body, it's structure becomes your structure
All the fear and stress of another
Any drug is addictive by any name
Even drugs in meat, they are the same
The FDA has America strung out
On drugs in beef no doubt
So if you think that what I say is a bunch of crock
Tell yourself you're gonna try and stop
Eatin meat and you'll see you can't compete
It's the number one drug on the street
Not crack, cause that was made for just blacks
But brown beef, for all American teeth
Life brings life and death brings death
Keep on eatin the dead and what's left
Absolute disease and negative
Read the book 'How to Eat to Live'
By Elijah Muhammad, it's a brown paperback
For anybody, either white or black
See how many cows must be pumped up fatter
How many rats gotta fall in the batter
How many chickens that eat shit you eat
How much high blood pressure you get from pig feet
See you'll consume, the FDA could care less 

[sic]
They'll sell you donkey meat and say it's
FRESH! For nineteen-ninety, you SUCKERS

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey you can ride with my dimes
She keeps em on the way
You say you need that window whirr but blow it away
It's no sweat
It’s no sweat
It's no sweat
There's no sweat
(Never let em see me sweat)

[Chorus]
Hey I’m the best in the game
Kick it with the best in the game
Ain't no need for me to worry bout the rest of you lames
It's no sweat
It's no sweat
It's no sweat
It's no sweat

[Verse]
Yeah you can call me the king
They also call me the vet
Haters can call me the reason their bitch ain't callin em back
The press be callin me cocky
I ask em what you expect
First album flopped, my label dropped
Man, I took off like a jet
Niggas hate on me often cause I'm a boss and exec
Do anything for my family, willing to die for respect
I bet I got it in cash, the same thing you got in a check
Wonder how I got it so fast, baby you gotta invest
I can be cool to St. Louis, I can be hot as Tibet
For you can get through security, I’d-done got on a jet
You must be under a rock if you haven’t heard of 'em yet
Paris and Germany be buggin me I’m certain to that
Anything my heart desires, I can certainly get
The Ferrari light SV what Its be a convertible yes
A lotta niggas say they name but I ain't heard of em yet
So when I check em they deserve that

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey you can ride with my dimes
She keeps em on the way
You say you need that window whirr but blow it away
It's no sweat
It's no sweat
It’s no sweat
There's no sweat
(Never let em see me sweat)

[Chorus]
Hey I'm the best in the game
Kick it with the best in the game
Ain't no need for me to worry bout the rest of you lames
It's no sweat
It's no sweat
It's no sweat
It's no sweat
By the end of the night
You're gonna leaving with me for sure
And by the end of the night
You're gon' be screaming for more, oh-ho

One step, two step that body to me
Unlock your love and I'll set you free
And if the feeling is right
We could get freaky for life, oh-ho

I've been thinking 'bout you tonight
Oh god, you've been looking so good tonight
I wanna see how you move tonight
Oh god, all the things we could do tonight

(And oh)
Your body is to blame, body is to blame
(And oh)
Your body is to blame, body is to blame

I've been thinking 'bout you everyday
I just wanna love you in every way
Only one to start to make you say
Eh, eh, eh, eh
I've been thinking 'bout you everyday
On top, don't stop
Do it every way
Only one to start to make you say
Eh, eh, eh, eh
I see the look in your eyes
I know I got what you need for sure
If wanting you is a crime
Then I don't wanna be right, oh-no

One step, two step your feeling on me
Take me on, boy
Give it to me
I love the look in your eyes
We could get freaky for life, oh-ho

I've been thinking 'bout you tonight
Oh god, you've been looking so good tonight
I wanna see how you move tonight
Oh god, all the things we could do tonight

(And oh)
Your body is to blame, body is to blame
(And oh)
Your body is to blame, body is to blame

I've been thinking 'bout you everyday
I just wanna love you in every way
Only one to start to make you say
Eh, eh, eh, eh
I've been thinking 'bout you everyday
On top, don't stop
Do it every way
Only one to start to make you say
Eh, eh, eh, eh
You're all I'm thinking of
You're all I wanna touch
I need more, can't get enough
Gotta put it on somebody
Ah, bring your body (2x)

(And oh)
Your body is to blame, body is to blame
(And oh)
Your body is to blame, body is to blame

I've been thinking 'bout you everyday
I just wanna love you in every way
Only one to start to make you say
Eh, eh, eh, eh
I've been thinking 'bout you everyday
On top, don't stop
Do it every way
Only one to start to make you say
Eh, eh, eh, eh

I've been thinking 'bout you tonight, oh girl
By the end of the night
You're gonna leaving with me for sure

[Verse 1]
I finally found love and it's fucking beautiful
I no longer bite my nails down to the cuticles (No more)
My sex stories ain't suitable for listeners
Cause prisoners to wack off, aw man (Yo, chill, chill, chill, chill)
Enough of that soft shit, me by myself is like the four horsemen
You're just a poor sportsman, your sports car could be your coffin
The thought of revenge release endorphins
That make me feel just like I'm swimming with some dolphins (God damn)
Ring, ring for this I gotta call 'em baby, shit, I might retire
Spend the rest of my days down in New Orleans maybe
Money changed me for the better
So I brought it back and got the all black Jetta
With the header and the leather bra
Thinking back like "Shit, dog, you really set the bar"
High as fuck 'bout to twist another
Too many people gone, damn, we miss our brothers
What the fuck is going on? A strange sense, ah
Something's going wrong, I can feel it in my fingers, man, shit
A strong scent lingers
Something's going wrong, I can feel it in my fingers
Like arthritis when it's raining, uh

[Bridge]
Let it rain on me
Let it rain
Uh, it's me
On me

[Verse 2]
It only took me nine times to make a debut, tenth time's a charm, shit (True)
Now man’s on road, that means I'm hard
Charge whatever on the Visa card, half moon Caesar parts
A lot of motherfuckers blind, they couldn't see the art
War stories, throw 'em through a stack of tables
Wrap my body in a stack of Bibles ‘cause shit could get dangerous
Bam Bam splash off the turn buckle (Splash)
Now you no longer have to use your nerves or muscles
We'll see who loves me if I need a liver, shit
You feel defenseless in the presence of a stripper (Shit)
You cannot be trusted with the access to the money
I crash more Benzes than when they practice with the dummies
I make these bastards look funny, Bugs Bunny, pussy
I make these bastards look funny, Bugs Bunny (Bugs Bunny)
Uh, yeah, these motherfuckers must be crazy, ‘cause I ain't going nowhere
Until I'm called up to the stars, then I'll go there
Until then, I'm back here to live another life
But for now I'm asking ladies like "What's up tonight?"
Baby, what's up tonight?
Yeah, what's up tonight?

[Outro]
I got the True Religion jean suit
G-Unit sneaker shit
Ah
I sway something, quaking in the night
Tripping on this one-track mind
Nicholas is never one to fight
Oh, she was saying
Oh, she was saying
Oh, she was saying

And I sway something to the right
Birthed from a democratic kind
He was never one to fight
Oh, she was saying
Oh, she was saying
Oh, she was saying

I sway something, quaking in the night
Birthed from a democratic kind
She was never one to fight
Oh, he was saying
Oh, he was saying
Oh, he was saying
Stop there where you go
Oh sweetheart
I love you the most
Stop there where you go
Oh sweetheart
I love you the most
About, about, about, about, about, her
To have to live
Oh, I had to live without her

I sway something, quaking in the night
Tripping on this one-track mind
Nicholas is never one to fight
Oh, she was saying
Oh, she was saying
Oh, she was saying

[Dialogue]
The people of El Paso Texas proudly present
The key to the city, to Khalid Donnel Robinson
Forever, from the city of the 915
*Cheers and applause*

[Verse 1]
Are we better off believing
What the ignorance suggests?
I wish living life was easy (Mhm)
But mine has been a mess
They say it comes with the seasons (Mhm)
But the seasons come and go (They go)
I go blurry when I'm thinking
Is it me or vertigo?

[Pre-Chorus]
Criticized, who am I to give up?
I’m breathing, what's the reason to let up?
Sympathize, who am I to give up?
Putting on my favorite get up

[Chorus]
Are we alive?
Or are we dreaming?
After the ride
Are you leaving?
Are we alive? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Or are we dreaming? (Darker days, brighter endings)
After the ride
Are you leaving? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I've been better off than broken
I’ve been battered, I've been beat
I wish I was more outspoken
But the words are out of reach
Hmm, thought I loved you in the moment
I was happy, I was young
I've been learning, I've been growing
But the worst is yet to come

[Pre-Chorus]
Criticized, who am I to give up? (Who am I?)
I'm breathing, what's the reason to let up?
Sympathize, who am I to give up?
Putting on my favorite get up

[Chorus]
Are we alive?
Or are we dreaming?
After the ride
Are you leaving?
Are we alive? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Or are we dreaming? (Darker days, brighter endings)
After the ride
Are you leaving? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Yeah

[Outro]
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been falling with my
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I’ve been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I’ve been falling with my
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I’ve been falling with my (Vertigo)
Eyes closed, eyes closed (Vertigo)
I've been falling with my (Vertigo)
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been, I've been, I’ve been
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been falling with my
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been falling with my

[Verse 1]
Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Verse 2]
Saturday nights, light gray Silverado
You drive it 'cause you have to
Stay up working late at a job you hate
Fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom
No more love, in and out of clubs
Knowing what you gotta do
You've got plans wrapped in rubber bands
And that's the only thing you'll never lose

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Bridge]
'Cause I care, I care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be
Than right here around you
I care, care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care about you
Nowhere like I do
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
Don't care about you
Nowhere like I
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)

[Dialogue]
I think I'm fearful of things like traveling
I'm fearful of failure
I'm fearful of being embarrassed
Things like that, I think hinder me from doing the best that I can sometimes
But I think that if I learn to be less fearful
I would get further
I feel like I'm not always in the correct direction
Even though I know I'm on the right path
I'm like "I'm on the right path"
But am I walking the right way, or should I be turning around?
Like little things like that that I go back and forth about in my head
And I think it's always nice to have reassurance
I think it's really nice to see how far being a genuine person can get you
For me at least, like I think that's the reason that I am where I am
I think that I am a big mix of all the people around me
And I'm just happy
I can't complain about anything
Oh yeah
That I'm trying to get so motherfucking high, nigga
I don't wanna feel nothing (Wait, what?)

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
We stay lit, all that shit
Damn, lil' baby, what you call that shit?
That's the red nose shawty, you a dog, lil' bitch
Touch the damn floor with your paws, lil' bitch
Shake that fat ass on my balls, lil' bitch
Damn, lil' baby, what you call that shit?
Shaking all off the wall, what you call that shit?
Damn, lil' baby what you call that shit? Yeah

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Baby, come and get some cash
Damn, lil' baby, that's a whole lotta ass
Got me feeling like Steve Nash
With a milk mustache, damn, I'm MVP, yeah
Baby, why you take up two seats? Yeah
Don't clap your hands, baby, clap them cheeks, yeah
Going brazy on the motherfucking D, yeah
Keep dancing, Happy Feet

[Interlude]
This is a speech to all you Instagram girls thinking it's cute when you twerking, 'kay?
I don't want to see your ass jiggling everywhere, do you Jenny?
No, I just text

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
We stay lit, all that shit
Damn, lil' baby, what you call that shit?
That's the red nose shawty, you a dog, lil' bitch
Touch the damn floor with your paws, lil' bitch
Shake that fat ass on my balls, lil' bitch
Damn, lil' baby, what you call that shit?
Shaking all off the wall, what you call that shit?
Damn, lil' baby what you call that shit? Yeah

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Lil Tory!
Girl, you look good when you back that ass up
Know I look good when I bag the cash up
Shawty from the hood and I'm back in the trap house
Talk that shit 'til you back to your dad's house
I'm a real nigga from the T and O
I got a bad little bitch that let me beat on the floor
I remember nights I used to sleep on the floor
I see them days, I don't ever wanna go back no more
Now my little bitch wanna fuck my bitch and I'ma let her fuck her
Pull up in a new estate, I got a Bentley truck
Got Ciroc, in the shot, like it came from Diddy
Got a hundred wild niggas that won't change for pussy
How you doin'? How you like it? Let me whisper in your ear
Tell you a lil' something you might like to hear
You know I be with star niggas like Trippie Redd
And if I whip this dick out, girl, you're giving me head, hey

[Chorus: Trippie Redd & Tory Lanez]
We stay lit, all that shit (Lil' shorty)
Damn, lil' baby, what you call that shit?
That's the red nose shawty, you a dog, lil' bitch
Touch the damn floor with your paws, lil' bitch
Shake that fat ass on my balls, lil' bitch
Damn, lil' baby, what you call that shit?
Shaking all off the wall, what you call that shit?
Damn, lil' baby what you call that shit? Yeah

[Verse 1]
The night is gettin' late, the crowd's headed home
It's just you and me girl on the lake shore
I know I just met you but I can't let you go
Forget about your friends, baby, I'll drive you home (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I'll set you on the tailgate, we'll take it nice and slow
I know it ain't your stop, but I won't tell a soul, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you gotta wake up for that nine to five
But what's the point of livin', girl
If you don't feel alive?

[Chorus]
We can sleep when we're dead, the night is still young
Pour another drink, talk that song
'Bout small town lovers, hot summer nights
Midnight dancin' in the headlights
Some day we might regret leavin' that love out by the lake
If you're gettin' tired honey, we'll put that thought to bed
But we can sleep when we're dead

[Verse 3]
Put your pretty arms around me, now get in nice and close
Whisper in my ear what you'd like to know
Now you can tell me 'bout your family, or tell me 'bout your day
Or our lips can do the talking, let's listen baby, what do you say?

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it's kinda crazy for a Tuesday night
But sometimes a good thing don't need time

[Chorus]
We can sleep when we're dead, the night is still young
Pour another drink, talk that song
'Bout small town lovers, hot summer nights
Midnight dancin' in the headlights
Some day we might regret leavin' that love out by the lake
If you're gettin' tired honey, we'll put that thought to bed

[Bridge]
With a smile she pulled me to water
Them southern girls, man, they just don't get any hotter
I said "No girl, got on my good jeans"
She looked at me boy like "What do you mean?"

[Chorus]
We can sleep when we're dead, the night is still young
Jump on in, let's have a little fun
Small town lovers, hot summer nights
Out here swimmin' in the moonlight
Some day we might regret leavin' this love out by the lake
But no matter what you do, don't forget what we said
We can sleep when we're dead
We can sleep when we're dead, aww yeah
We can sleep when we're dead
Alcohol/drinkingI can be your champagne wine

Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air

Fix me up a mixed drink, Bacardi

I been drinkin' Jack and Coke a lot

'Cause I just wanna dream, I just wanna drink

Come on, get drunk
You know you wanna

Open up a beer, you say, "Get over here
And play a video game"

Drinking in the small town firelight
(Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice)

We were skipping school and drinking on the job
With the boss
Drinking cherry schnapps in the velvet night

You sitting, sipping on your Black Cristal, yeah

Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town

We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving

Darling, darling
Doesn't have a problem lying to herself
'Cause her liquor's top shelf

Drink all day and we talk 'til dark

(Blue Ribbons on ice)
Play them like guitars, you're like one of my toys

It's so crazy, I could drink it like tequila sunrise

Get out that whiskey

Ring the alarm, get on the horn and inform
Everyone from Oregon to Melbourne
That the funk phenomenon has been reborn and transformed
You coulda sworn that you wasn't warned 'cause we was
Trapped in the box that rap had spawned
It was a square until we kicked it to an octagon
We gotten strong from the pain it's undergone
Whereupon we kill the beat when the mic ain't on
That's my motherfuckin' procedure
I'm cold with the flow I will freeze ya
I'm the emperor, I'm Caesar
Can somebody tell me where the MCs are?
I violate over guitars, annihilate and operate like I'm on ER
Lyrically gang bang 'cause I'm behind bars
And rearrange DNA, play like God
I bring it back

Back to life, back to life
Back to life, back to life

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
It's dang credible, original, strong individual
Send a million decibels of sound through your physical
Alligator ritual turns out it was the visual
Proficient with the lyrical, a vision like a miracle
Damage all you mumblin' MCs rhyming 'bout decimal
Increasing no residual, why you still remain minimal
Maximize, utilize, my plan mineral
Do not try to bite because my shit is not edible
Rhyme unforgettable like Nat King Cole
You can feel it on your neck like you in a chokehold
Unfold the mystery, unload the BEP
Bangin' on your speakers while you haters wait impatiently
What would be the next step? Next move on set?
Betting that it's over, but we haven't even started yet
More shit, raw shit, complex, intricate
Resurrect the bitch and bring it back like this

Back to life, back to life
Back to life, back to life
Back to life, back to life

Rockin' everybody, now I'm knockin' out my challengers
I'm a new Bugatti never roll up in a Challenger
Uh, you're messin' with the trinity
Try this trot ain't go in your vicinity
Maybe that was complex, let me say it differently
Black Eyed Peas rockin' 'til infinity

[Chorus]
We ain't messin' around
Shits about to go down

Get ready, get ready
Get ready, get ready
Get ready, get ready

[Verse 2: Taboo]
Get ready for the bomb drop
Choppin' motherfuckers with my tomahawk
Blood clot, blood clot
Cardiac arrest make your heart stop
You're now tuned into my murder log
Boomin' bass play with my dialog
Zoom out so you can see my whole catalog
I was underground when I was an underdog
Now I'm feelin' like a top dog
I remember break dancin' on the boulevard
Moon walk on the side walk
I put my little tag on the butt stock
Our city, our city
Everybody go and see my girl Fitty
Worldwide with the committee
B-E-P rockin' 'til infinit

[Chorus]
We ain't messin' around
Shits about to go down
This is for real, this is for real
We ain't playin' no games
Do you hear what I'm sayin'?
This is for real, this is for real
Get ready, get ready
Get ready, get ready
Get ready, get ready

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap]
Get ready for the new era
Got the new A game call it newsletter
You catch that? You got that?

Makin' new mozzarella got new cheddar
Tellin' you Cinderalla she could do better
So forget your man, forget your man
And come and stand under my umbrella
Got the new hot shit that's the new pepper
Got a brand new step, I'm a two stepper
Got a hot chick, she got a few extras
So I live my life like I'm Hugh Hefner
Ain't life so pretty?
I was countin' dimes, now I'm countin' millies
Ain't got no time I'm busy
Black Eyed Peas rockin' 'til infinit

[Intro]
We are the music makers
And we are the dreamers of dreams

[Chorus: will.i.am & Esthero]
One is for the love
Two is for the soul
Three's the magic number
And four is forever
Five is so alive
And six is in the mix
So peep, I hope you’re ready for

[Verse 1: Taboo]
I'm out for the night, smile for the lights
Looking for a taste and I end up with a slice
Like P à la mode, I'm fresh and I’m froze
My chain hang low and my raps pure gold
I'm nasty and nice, a wolf on the mic
These sheep sound ba-a-a-d, but they flock for a bite
Let's Midnight Maraud, we out with the claws
Howl at the moon and we glance at the stars
We up and away, top tier everyday
They pause and we play, we ball and they fade
We rockin' over here, just jumpin' over here
Them other niggas gold but we shine like veneers
I'm rush over those wack little haters like plaque
With the L M N O P's and the Peas that be Black
With the elemental freeze so please stand back
Tell me can you rock it, can you rock it like that?

[Pre-Chorus 1: will.i.am]
Yup, yup, yo Tab and Ap, time to get the strap
Hit em off with the click clack, Mortal Kombat
I'ma slap em with the boom bap, top a four mat
Told them niggas step back, these are power maniacs
I’m the black Power Ranger, baby you can call me Zack
That’s exactly how I flip the lyric, rap acrobat
That a wrap, ready to attack, heavy impact
Nigga I'ma a thunder cat, you know where my number’s at, number one

[Chorus: will.i.am & Esthero]
One is for the love
Two is for the soul
Three's the magic number
And four is forever
Five is so alive
And six is in the mix
So peep, I hope you're ready for

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
I slip on the scene, I'm slick and I’m clean
I slide off the green like my money's vaseline
The mood is Supreme, the ladies lookin' nice
They rollin' with the team yeah we gotta fit 'em right
You won't be on the night 'cause the itch don't stop
We blowin' up the spot 'til the roof goes pop
You somethin' and they not, they warm and we hot
They sink to the bottom and we rise to the top
Umm
We doin' things she just talk about
We makin' headlines, she just word of mouth
We knock it out the park and you strikin' out
You fallin' off, we hold it down
You crack when the alligator snap
With the L M N O P's and the Peas that be Black
With the elemental freeze so please stand back
Tell me can you rock it, can you rock it like that?

[Pre-Chorus 2: will.i.am]
Yup, yup, real shit, I go rock it like this
3 pointer, hit a three, yes indeed, it a swish
I be deep in the abyss, I am Pisces the fish
When I'm dick up a bitch it be heavenly bliss
Oh yes, look at this wicked shit that I spit
Two long one tongue, two lips, larynx
Kill a lyricist, rock the fatal linguistic
On my 1-2 shit, never on that two list, we number one

[Chorus: will.i.am & Esthero]
One is for the love
Two is for the soul
Three's the magic number
And four is forever
Five is so alive

Yo, what it is? What it do? What's goodie?
You are now tuned in to the sounds of
A Tribe Called De La Peas
L.A. New York collabo
You know what it is, East West all day
I go by the name of- ahh don't worry 'bout that

[Chorus]
(All around the world) Come take a trip, Ma

(All around the world) Come build with us
(All around the world) Who wanna spit with us?
Come make it bounce (keep bouncing)

[Verse 1 - Phife Dawg]
We on that world tour with Muhammad again
Fifty cities run with Black Eyed Peas 'n them
First show in T-Dot where the shorty's be gems
Twenty-thou' loosin' they minds as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically I'm more like Stephen Curry with the mic though
Kyrie Irv's sweety with that Bubba Chuck handle
First heard me in the nineties with that native tongues yo
Raspy type flows, De La jones arose
Twenty five years later, ain't too much done changed, B
Owner of three homes with my eyes on a Bentley
Drive support system, I could never be shady
Me cheat the game, fuck I look like, Brady?
Staples in LA, Japan, Sapporo Dome
Camp Nou in Barcelona, Sweden's Ericsson Globe
Make a hater's stomach bubble til they straight up hurl
And while I'm out on tour keep ya hands off my girl
As we commence to rock

[Chorus]
(All around the world) Come take a trip, Ma
(All around the world) Come rock with us
(All around the world) Come vibe with us

(All around the world) Who wanna spit with us
(All around the world) Come make it bounce

[Verse 2 - will.i.am]
Creepin' like a zone creeper, reekin' like I smoke reefer
Mind reader, thought leader, no blink and never sleeper
Beat you with beat beater, EQ the bass deeper
Attitude like Ice Cube, put you in that cold freezer
A hundred miles of running so I ran a hundred kilometers
Grim Reaper ain't hunting 'cause they couldn't kill the leader
Tried to break my center but they couldn't come a centimeter
Blast off, semi-up, arcade Centipeder
Space Evader, Animater, rollin' with the alligator
Glow like illuminator, follow I'm the navigator
Overthrowin' dictators, posin' for the pic takers
Dick in swollen digits, paper aggregator
Yeah, I'm on that Hip-Hop grown shit
EMC squared means I'm on the microphone shit
Dead with mumble rap, Attack of the Clones
I'm on that Jedi , I'm in that ziggy, ziggy zone

[Chorus]
(All around the world) Come take a trip, Ma
(All around the world) Come rock with us
(All around the world) Come vibe with us
(All around the world) Come ride with us
(All around the world) Come ill with us
(All around the world) Come bill with us
(All around the world) Who wanna spit with us
(All around the world) Come make it bounce

[Verse 3 - apl.de.ap]
Flow tighter, globe trotter, don't need a ghost writer
Night time, all nighter, rhyme like a bull fighter
Dynamite igniter, near sider, far sider
Legally blind but I got the foresight
Insider, outsider, Northsider, Southsider
West side, East side, every where I'm worldwide
Rugged like a Ruff Ryder, sunken like a skin diver
Plug in' I dug in, but don't cum inside her
Blessed with the insight, stay lit, I've been bright
Murder that ink, now you see how my pen fight
Inner space, outer space, base like an upright
Fornicate, in a cape, capable of flight
Up, up all the way, up on the throne
Kingdom I ring all them bell made from chrome
Bring only singles, so they give me dome
I'm in my zigga, zigga, I'm in my zone

[Chorus]
(All around the world) Come take a trip, Ma
(All around the world) Come rock with us
(All around the world) Come vibe with us
(All around the world) Come ride with us
(All around the world) Come ill with us
(All around the world) Come bill with us
(All around the world) Who wanna spit with us
(All around the world) Come make it bounce
(Keep bouncing)

[Verse 4 - Posdnuos]
I am not of this format
So let me formally introduce to you a formula
Standing on your doormat
I'm an East Coast equation
Qualified to earn it worldwide
Running through your tour laps
Twenty tears is gain like the currency
And I reside within the state of currently
So when I travel it seems my passport looks like
Them sandwiches made out of them ice creams
And when Jack Frost comes around
We bounce to the other side of the globe
To towns where he just can't chillax
Met up with peeps instead it has past to be safe
In a place where its known to get relaxed
Life's merry-go-round and she want to spin
Got me thinking about back when due to my dark skin
They ask me, when they pass me
They used to diss me, harass me
Now they ask me if they can kiss me

[Bridge]
All around the world
All around the world
All around the world
All around the world

[Outro: Taboo]
We went all around the planet (planet)
With big dreams, gigantic (gigantic)
Picture this shit, panoramic (panoramic)
We grew this shit organic (yeah)
We didn't blow up quick, we volcanic
We work that shit like mechanics (mechanics)
No sinking ship, no Titanic (Titanic)
To be specific, we crossed the Pacific and Atlantic
Goddamn it we worldwide
(All around the world)
(All around the world)
(All around the world)

[Chorus]
It's the new style
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon get it

New wave, a new wave
New wave, a new wave

What is it?

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
It's the new flavor
I put in the work, do the hard labor
Go and tell the world, go and tell ya neighbor
Tell her that my daddy's name is Darth Vader
Willy Skywalker with the Light Saber
Resilient, killer with the omega
Chameleon, transform to a saber
Tooth tiger who's eyes are lasers
Lights from the iris beam pager
The Midas Touch gold exchanger
The tidas clutch, code name strangler
'Cause I choke the microphone, that's my disclaimer
Don't sniff cocaine, that's no buena
I know shit, so I know what's a no brainer
So don't be afraid of the new flavor
It's the newest, the new, brand new

[Chorus]
It's the new style
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon get it

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon get it

Boo!

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
Scare motherfuckers like it's October
I'ma take you higher than a pot smoker
Boil in the spot like it's hot yoga
I still take shots so I'm not sober
Yeah you see me shinin' like a Supernova
Brighter than a diamond because I keep it solar
I might just blind you when I show up
Hold up, 'cause I roll up with soldiers
My explosion give me exposure
Can't stop, won't stop, so there's never closure
Coming with the lava rocks, hot boulders
Make you have a- have a- have a hand out
Over and over and over
Warped like a motor
Nice on the mic when I strike like a cobra
So don't be afraid of the new flavor
It's the new, it's the new, brand new

[Chorus]
It's the new style
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon get it
It's the new style
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon get it

New wave, it's a...

[Verse 3: Taboo]
Hey bro, I'ma ride that new wave
Halo on my head like a toupee
Stay low, bass low, lower than a grave
Get no pesos, gotta stay paid
A while ago all of it was misbehaved
T-A-B double O at the rave
Now I just sip T-E-A
And they don't trip on my ETA
Tab always on time, no delay
Need a rewind, bring it back, replay
What the fuck they be rhymin' 'bout these days
They be mumblin' like "What the fuck did he say?"
So please speak clear and enunciate
Don't be all up in my ear and irritate
Be different, differentiate
Be the new, be the new, brand new

[Chorus]
It's the new style
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon get it
It's the new style
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon get it
It's the new style

Come, come, come and get it
It's the new style
Come, come, come and get it

Please complete me
It must be the answer
Everything just seems to be numbness around
Why aren't you near me?
What stars are you under?
If only I could hear from you right now
Did your mind ever clear me?
Has your faith found a pastor?
Or am I still in shapes in the clouds
Did you see me on TV?
Have you seen the disasters?
We don't have long till the earth is drowned
If only I had seen clearly as we lay beneath thunder
Feeling the feeling of pride
The pride that brought me down
They all stood and cheered me
What made your departure?
I still remember you walking off in the crowd
The moon appears freely but arose to its structure
Days and nights have been letting me down
This place doesn't move me
Everything just seems to be constantly letting me down
This place doesn't move me
Everything just seems to be constantly letting me down
This place doesn't move me
This bow has no archer
Numbness around
It must be the answer
Everything just seems to be numbness around
Please complete me
The stars are shattered

[Intro: Anne-Marie]
Don't leave me, don’t leave me alone

[Verse 1:  Anne-Marie]
I don't wanna lie, can we be honest?
Right now while you're sitting on my chest
I don’t know what I'd do without your comfort
If you really go first, if you really left

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
I don't know if I would be alive today
With or without you like night and day
Read and repeat every conversation
Being with you, everyday is a Saturday
But every Sunday you've got me praying

[Chorus:  Anne-Marie]
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I’m cold
Don’t you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

[Pre-Drop: Anne-Marie]
Don’t leave me alone
Don't leave me a...

[Drop: David Guetta & Anne-Marie]
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha
Don't leave me alone, leave me a...
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha

[Verse 2: Anne-Marie]
I don't wanna call and you not answer
Never see your face light up my phone (don’t leave me alone, don't leave me a...)
Never see you singing "Tiny Dancer"
Everytime my head hurts, everytime I'm low

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
'Cause I don't know if I would be alive today
With or without you like night and day
Everything about you uncomplicated
Here with you, everyday is a Saturday
But every Sunday, you've got me praying

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

[Drop: David Guetta & Anne-Marie]
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha
Don't leave me alone, leave me a...
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha

[Bridge: Anne-Marie]
Don't you ever leave me
Don't you ever go
Don't you ever leave me
No

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone (don't leave me a...)
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

[Outro: Anne-Marie]
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone
I'm writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on November 6th, in which I'll be voting in the state of Tennessee. In the past I've been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country. I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG. I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent.
I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love. Running for Senate in the state of Tennessee is a woman named Marsha Blackburn. As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me. She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values. I will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives. Please, please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values. For a lot of us, we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 100% on every issue, but we have to vote anyway.
So many intelligent, thoughtful, self-possessed people have turned 18 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count. But first you need to register, which is quick and easy to do. October 9th is the LAST DAY to register to vote in the state of TN. Go to vote.org and you can find all the info. Happy Voting! 🗳😃🌈

[Verse 1]
I'm cancerous, so when I diss, you wouldn't want to answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
A hellspawn droppin' a stealth bomb
Six mics in The Source, they borrowed one from LL's arm
You beef with me, I'm a even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too funny off of twenty Nō-Dōz
Hop on a snowboard and hit a tree harder than 'Sonny' Bono
So if I said I never get buzzed
That would mean I lie and get butt more than the president does
Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I took her freakin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet
My nerves hurt and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads
Every girl I ever went out wit' has gone les'
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Talk back, fake sick, get out of school, steal from people
And don't think before you do somethin' that's illegal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Fry from an overload and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm 'posed to teach kids how to behave?

[Hook 1]
Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
I slap women and eat 'shrooms, then O.D
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me?

[Verse 2]
Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must have been 'Ron' Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the session on hold
Did 'em both and smeared blood on a white Bronco
My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player, just a ill rhyme-sayer
That'll spray a Aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap style's warped, I'm runnin' out the morgue
With your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm about as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother, are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel
Will someone please explain to my brain
That I just severed a main vein
With a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sigh, either I'm fried or I'm nuts
Cause if you ain't tiltin' this room, neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
Cause when I drop this solo hit, it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it and dubbed over it

[Hook 2]
I came to the club drunk with a fake I.D
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
I've been with ten women who got HIV
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
I've got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably want to grow up to be just like me

[Verse 1]
She fell down
Head first in the sound
Tried to stop herself from moving
But it was too profound
Touch her pants
To try to quit your glance
'Cause you just notice the dirty way
That American girls dance

[Chorus]
Did she go right to your head
When she danced upon the bed?
Is she a dream or is she a drag?
Can she do the shag?

[Verse 2]
Later on
To find out she was on
There's nothing so unbearable
As knowing that she's gone
Dream awake
To try to make her stay
You know that you give her everything
But she does it anyway

[Chorus]
Did she go right to your head
When she danced upon the bed?
Is she a dream or is she a drag?
Can she do the shag?

[Bridge]
There's one thing that you will never know
Is how she got to be so whoa-oh-oh
Beautiful
She's unreal
Exactly how it feels
I think they've got a line for it
She invented sex appeal
You'll undress
And try to get some rest
'Cause you'll just think of her summer hair
And her wintery caress

[Chorus]
Did she go right to your head
When she danced upon the bed?
Is she a dream or is she a drag?
Can she do the shag?

[Verse 1:]
I turn tables and speak too softly
I don't make much sense, I don’t make much sense
You're unable to calm down lightly
You're so intense, yeah you’re so intense

[Pre-Chorus:]
So, you just let me know what you're missing
Come take the pedestal
You'd be the reason why I keep slipping
But come home

[Chorus:]
You and I, we're one too many worlds apart
It really shouldn't work but it does
It really shouldn't work but it does
And side by side, we're different but somehow the same
It really shouldn't work but it does
It really shouldn’t work but it does
When it comes to us
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes to us
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes to us

[Verse 2:]
You’re too playful, and never serious
But I love you that way, yeah I love you that way
I'm too careful and always in a rush
But it’s all okay, yeah it's always okay

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Chorus:]
Dab Dab

She say she a model yeah
She gon' of that molly yeah
I want it, I want it right now
The way that she pop it right now
She want that money yeah
Can't get that money yeah
Don't be acting like you scared
Don't be acting like you scared
That shit that you willing
I know you ain't scared

Ohhh
How you do-ho-ho
Make a n*gger want to blow that paper on you
N*gger, n*gger blow that paper on you

Dab, dab, dab
Booty so big it comes with a ass
Yeah, I had to ask
I she coming with me
Cause the club closed at 3
Everything on me (2x)

[Verse 1]
I remember when loving you was so fine
We would spend all our time as one
Now you're treating me as if I'm second-best
And got me feeling stressed
Oh, how come?

[Chorus]
Who's that girl with eyes for you?
Who's that girl with eyes for you?
(Eyes for you, my baby)

[Verse 2]
I thought this would last forever, but
It seems perhaps I was a fool
The thoughts of losing you been in my mind
Who's taking up my time with you?

[Chorus]
So who's that girl with eyes for you?
(Eyes on you)
Who's that girl with eyes for you?
(Eyes on my man, uh-huh)

[Bridge]
If you don't cherish me, baby please use honesty
Don't continue to lie and live in secrecy
I gave to you my world, in case you didn't know
So the least you can do, tell me, who is that girl?

[Chorus]
Who's that girl with eyes for you?
Who's that girl with eyes for you?
(I can't hear you)
Who's that girl with eyes for you?
Who's that girl with eyes for you?
(Tell her to go)

[Outro]
My eyes do see her eyes on...
My eyes do see...
Lellow, Krucial, H.E., baby, Mr. Brown, what what

[Verse 1]
Only one conversation
Getting you to my place, yeah
And we can have a situation
All you gotta do is say, "Yeah"
But do you really wanna stop now?
You already let me see what it could be
And right now, I don't want you to go without me

[Pre-Chorus]
It seems like every time
I tried to get through to you
Try to slip my way, baby
In my mind we get this right, and
You decide to stay

[Chorus]
It wasn't supposed to end like this
We should keep dancing
I don't want to go home like this
Baby, give me this one last wish
Can you move your hips like this?
Do a little twist
Turn that thing around then dip
And then we in a zone like this
Keep it going like this, yeah

[Verse 2]
Look at us on the floor now
I'm digging everything, I like your smile
You only wanna stay a little while
But you ain't gotta go, no
DJ playing my song now
It's my turn to feel you out
'Cause baby, you know that
All I wanna do is just stay with you, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
It seems like every time
I tried to get through to you
Try to slip my way, baby
In my mind we get this right, and
You decide to stay, oh-oh

[Chorus]
It wasn't supposed to end like this (Yeah)
We should keep dancing (We should keep dancing)
I don't want to go home like this (No)
Baby, give me this one last wish
Can you move your hips like this? (Yeah)
Do a little twist (Yeah)
Turn that thing around then dip
And then we in a zone like this
Keep it going like this, yeah

[Bridge]
Something about the way I get a rise when you next to me
I don't wanna be apart, yeah, yeah
Damn, I'm loving this spotlight
You're turning me on, on, on, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
It wasn't supposed to end like this
We should keep dancing
I don't want to go home like this
Baby, give me this one last wish
It wasn't supposed to end like this
We should keep dancing
I don't want to go home like this
Baby, give me this one last wish
Can you move your hips like this?
Do a little twist
Turn that thing around then dip
And then we in a zone like this
Keep it going like this, yeah

[Verse 1]
This here is expensive linen
Table wear with the Versace in it
I'm in able care but I'm barely livin'
Oh, yeah, I'm a millionaire so excuse the stares
I'm gettin' high
Let's play a game of truth
Maybe it's something that I can't handle
When's the last time that the shit hit the roof?
And I was the only one takin' the blame for it?
I guess it's my fault 'cause I shoulda knew
You not the queen to my throne, how the fuck you ride in my coupe?
I keep sayin' I'm grown, but it takes two
I guess I'll read it in the mornin' on that front page news
That bullshit

[Verse 2]
Oh, hold on
W-Wait a minute
I told you I was a simple man
But you lost one
That pushed the limit
You might never get it back again, oh, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, before you came along
I was comfortable with just doing my thing
I had a million girls before
You walked through the door, look how you made me change
I did all of this for you
You were never true
Girl, you know you shady
I never thought I'd see the day
Give my heart away
Now I'm getting faded

[Chorus]
I gave you love, you gave me nothing
What more you want?
At first you wanted me to leave
Now you don't
Sick of the back and forth
I guess I'm about to blow up
Girl, you ain't listening
Shut up with all that bitching
It's all in your mind, so

[Post-Chorus]
Get your mind right
Oh
What? Yeah, get your mind right
Get it right
Uh, get your mind right
Oh, woah
What? Yeah, get your mind right

[Verse 3]
It's lonesome when I'm not in it
But we'll never be the same again
Now the love's gone and you can feel it
Guess I just don't know how to pretend
Oh, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, before you came along
I was comfortable with just doing my thing
I had a million girls before
You walked through the door, look how you made me change
I did all of this for you
You were never true
Girl, you know you shady
I never thought I'd see the day
Give my heart away
Now I'm getting faded

[Chorus]
I gave you love, you gave me nothing
What more you want?
At first you wanted me to leave
Now you don't
Sick of the back and forth
I guess I'm about to blow up
Girl, you ain't listening
Shut up with all that bitching
It's all in your mind, so

[Post-Chorus]
Get your mind right
Oh
What? Yeah, get your mind right
Get it right
Uh, get your mind right
Oh, woah
What? Yeah, get your mind right
Get your mind right
Oh
What? Yeah, get your mind right
Get it right
Uh, get your mind right
Oh, woah
What? Yeah, get your mind right
Oh
Uh, get your mind right
Oh, woah
What? Yeah, get your mind right
Baby

[Verse]
How could I allow her to do it?
They say a man ain't supposed to cry
But right now I feel so foolish (Oh, why?)
Thought I could trust her
I guess I thought wrong
So many times I played the fool
I guess I was the dummy all along (Damn)

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess I had it coming 'cause I'm famous
She was in it for the money, I can't blame her
She tried to break my pockets, but broke my heart
Yeah, she tried, guess I'm not that stupid after all
And my baby stuck in her ways
Girl, it's fine, what a nice try
At least we had a good time
Bitch, goodbye

[Chorus]
You don't even see her when you come across her
You give her that alley-oop, think that bitch gon' cross ya
And if you got a lot of money, that pussy gon' cost ya
Don't trust that ho, don't be a sucka

[Post-Chorus]
Hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids
That's all she want
Hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids
That's all she want
Hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids
Don't trust that ho, don't be a sucka
Hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids
That's all she want
Hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids
That's all she want
Hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids
Don't trust that ho, don't be a sucka

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess I had it coming 'cause I'm famous
She was in it for the money, I can't blame her
She tried to break my pockets, but broke my heart
Yeah, she tried, guess I'm not that stupid after all
And my baby stuck in her ways
Girl, it's fine, what a nice try
At least we had a good time
Bitch, goodbye

[Chorus]
You don't even see her when you come across her
You give her that alley-oop, think that bitch gon' cross ya
And if you got a lot of money, that pussy gon' cost ya
Don't trust that ho, don't be a sucka

[Post-Chorus]
Hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids
That's all she want
Hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids
That's all she want
Hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids
Don't trust that ho, don't be a sucka

That's all she want
Hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids, hunnids
Don't trust that ho, don't be a sucka

[Verse 1]
Now that you're here, baby
(Now that you're here)
I don't ever want, don't ever want to be without you
(I don't wanna be without you)
No, babe
(I can barely breathe without you)
And I know that it's clear, baby (Know that it's clear)
'Cause I get that feeling that I only get when I'm around you
(Only with you, that's how I know that it's real)
Nobody else, that's why I know it's real
That's how I know we gon' make it
Can't turn my back 'cause you my baby
Sometimes I admit I do get hurt
But the question I ask then is
Do I really love you? (Yes)
Do I think our love is gonna pass the test? (Yes)
And honestly, I do
I do

[Pre-Chorus]
Some things last forever
But we know that's not always true
Just how I will always be here for you, you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I got a bag full of goodies, goodies (I got a bag, baby)
And I can't feel my face, yeah
Is it real or fake? (Oh, oh)
Real or fake? Real or fake?
Oh, this love thing, yeah, yeah (Haha)
And you don't know what you be doing to me
Girl, your love's got me high
Is it real or fake?
This love thing
Baby, I just wanna hold you
Wanna hold you (Wanna hold you), kiss you, and squeeze you
Is it real or fake?
Your booty, this love thing
And baby girl, I need you
I need you, I need you
Haha, and I don't wanna wait
For this love thing

[Verse 2]
Baby, I just wanna hold you (Hold you)
Put all of my loving all on ya (On ya)
Let me show you how it really is (Baby, let me show you)
This love thing (Let me show you)
And boy, you know I'm repping Houston (Houston)
So baby, you know I can turn up on ya
Show you how real this could really get
This love thing

[Pre-Chorus]
Some things last forever
But we know that's not always true
Just how I will always be here for you, you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I got a bag full of goodies, goodies (I got a bag, baby)
And I can't feel my face, yeah, oh, oh
Is it real or fake?
Oh, this love thing, yeah, yeah (Haha)
And you don't know what you be doing to me
Girl, your love's got me high
Is it real or fake?
This love thing
Baby, I just wanna hold you
Wanna hold you (Wanna hold you), kiss you, and squeeze you
Is it real or fake?
Your booty, this love thing

Mean Mr. Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark
Trying to save paper

Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose

He's such a mean old man
He's such a mean old man

His sister Shelly works in a shop
She never stops
She's a go-getter

Takes him out to look to look at the Queen
The only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene

He's such a dirty old man
He's such a dirty old man
Hey Mean Mr. Mustard
Such a dirty, dirty Mean Mr. Mustard
Such a dirty, dirty Mean Mr. Mustard

Mean Mr. Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark
Trying to save paper

Sleeps in a hole in the road
Save enough to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose

[Outro]

Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man...

[Verse 1: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
I spend a lot of days entrenched in your duvet
My latest phase to unwind, is just press play
On that feel-good song that I hear bouncing from ear to ear

[Chorus]
I love when you dance with me, but
I always step on your feet, I
Hope you can forgive me, if
I promise to stay on beat

[Verse 2: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
Sit on the couch watching ET
So relaxed sipping peppermint tea
Feels like when I step out of the shower
After nearly an hour

[Chorus]
I love when you dance with me, but
I always step on your feet, I
Hope you can forgive me, if
I promise to stay on beat
Lover, Leaver (Taker, Believer)

[Verse 1]
Oh my holy lord
Sets my soul on fire
Flames of love and sweet perfume
She’s my heart's desire
She’s an angel straight from Hell
Draws me to the deep
In the darkness way below
It’s my heart she’ll keep
Yeah

Thunder underground
Watch the castle fall
Sound of wind it takes the sky
And winter takes us all
Mountain high against the sky
Watches as we pray
Laughing loud and smiling proud
This is where we lay

[Chorus]
Lover
Leaver
Taker
Believer

[Verse 2]
Oh God Hellfire
Witch of Endor raised
Saul would fall to his knees, watch the fire rage
Satan plays his flute for him
The sound it burns his ears
Watches as the peace of man slips and disappears

Brave New World

[Verse 3]
As to the drifters of the high rift plains
They can see the ashes, and the acid rain
It turns to dust before my very eyes
And it chokes to death within the smog it lies

[Chorus]
​Take one look at your skies
And in the darkness realize
Kill fear, the power of lies
For we will not be hypnotized
The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)

[Verse 4]
Slow down, you move too fast
You got to make the moments last
Just kicking down the cobblestones
Looking for fun and feelin’ groovy, groovy

Highway Tune

No stopping at the red light
Red light
Red light
Red light
Red light
Red light
Red light

Flower Power

She's a sparrow of the dawn
Our love is born
Our love is born
Our love is born
Our love is born
I wanna tell you what love is about
I wanna tell you what love is about
Love is about
Love is about

Rollin' and Tumblin'

[Verse 5]
Well, I'm rollin' and tumblin'
Cried the whole night long
Well, I'm rollin' and tumblin' baby
Cried the whole night long
Well, I woke up this morning
I didn't know right from wrong
If the river was whiskey baby
And I was a diving duck
If the river was whiskey baby
And I was a diving duck
Well, I'd go down oh yeah
And I would never come up
Well, I'd go down oh yeah
And I would never come up
Well, I'd go down oh yeah
And I would never come up

Hoochie Coochie Man

We're gonna rip it up, the neighbors might complain

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
I think it's almost 4 AM but baby I'm still feelin' just fine
Ice all up in a plastic cup and I'ma keep on sippin' all night, yeah

Bucket of liquor, we're getting sicker

Look, look, uh

I keep on walking
'Cause love is like a mile away
Hear people talking
But I don't listen to shit they say
I'm smoking this blunt
I don't give a fuck if the devil is holding me back
I'm smoking this blunt
I don't give a fuck if the devil is holding me back
I keep on walking
'Cause love is like a mile away
Hear people talking

I don't give a fuck if the devil is holding me back

[Verse]
Man, like last night I O.D
Every day is like KOD
Same shit tonight
Champagne on me
Man, what the hell is wrong with me?
A nigga too fly to be in the club
Bad bitches scheming
But I'm never gon', never gon' pay to fuck, right
Just look at all these fake ass superficials
Probation over, I'm registrating two pistols
You niggas make me sick
Blowing like a fuckin' whistle
And tired of glorifying niggas I ain't fuckin with
Real dough, I'm 'bout it
My hands right and my circle small
Nigga, back up, I feel proud
I'm still spending money from that first Chris Brown
And I'm smoking, feeling clouded
I'm elevating my flight mileage
Frustrated, we made it
Fuck you, nigga, I'm gon' stay wildin'

[Chrous]
I keep on walking
'Cause love is like a mile away
Hear people talking
But I don't listen to shit they say
I'm smoking this blunt
I don't give a fuck if the devil is holding me back
I'm smoking this blunt
I don't give a fuck if the devil is holding me back
I keep on walking
'Cause love is like a mile away
Hear people talking
But I don't listen to shit they say

[Intro]

[Chorus]
Man, verse by verse
I'ma make these weak niggas disperse (Weak nigga)
Man, I swear, verse by verse
I’ma make these weak rappers disperse (Weak nigga)
Man, I'ma get 'em, I’ma get 'em (Ayy)
Watch me get 'em, I'ma get 'em (Ayy)
I'ma get 'em, I'ma get ’em (Ayy)
Watch me get ’em, I'ma get ’em

[Verse]
I'm very instrumental, to any instrumental (Yeah)
You ain't on my level, my nigga, not even a little (Uh, uh)
You at the bottom, not even at Malcolm in the Middle (Yeah)
You homo ass nigga, go and eat some Skittles (Haha)
Now hop up on the rainbow, try to reach where I am though
I'm a little further up, damn I’m near the angels
So at your highest point, you still wouldn't reach my ankles
You are what you eat, well that ain't true, 'cause I'm anal (Ooh)
And the people show love like a bear hug
I'm here to last, they temporary, call them handcuffs
Fair enough, I stand behind my bars like a felon does (Ayy)
If you a boss, meet the executive (Yeah)
And when it come to paper, meet the editor (Uh)
A little better, bruh, you need to step, step it up
I'm on my business, that's my forte (Word)
You, you beat around the bush like foreplay (Huh)
And they anticipated me like the court date (Huh)
So for the bars, I'm in charge like the courts say
And if the courts say they know, I did it like OJ (What)
And I'm in the next city like a tour day
Ain't no "I" in team, but there's an "I" in win
Ain't no "I" in lose, but there's an "I" in him
Meaning me (Me), meaning moi (Moi)
Peep the repertoire, up the upper echelon
That's high, high in the sky
High to the point that I almost saw God (Wow)
Wow, I stand out from the rest of the crowd like yeah
But ain't got to play ball to hear your cheer in the crowd
Perform so well, I might as well take a bow
Shitting on these niggas, like a movement from my bowels
People want to know how it feels in the clouds
But I guess they'll never know, 'cause I'm never coming down
I started with a dream, added a little faith
And mixed it with adversity and let it marinate
I put it in the oven for a while, let it bake (Yeah)
Call it food for thought, put it on your plate (Eat)
I'm from the mighty Motown, home sweet home
Where I roam like a phone, in an unknown zone
My niggas roam like a phone in an unknown zone
And we could not atone, the money, clothes, and hoes
And my rep is sell like a boatload
Fam', you couldn't fill my shoes like bozos
And I'm so low
Because I heard what hoes really want, a ring like Frodo (No)
Coastal, made my nickname postal
Why they local like they old schools
Man, I should beat 'em like ProTools
Will Ferrell, nigga started out old school

[Chorus]
Man, verse by verse
I'ma make these weak niggas disperse (Weak nigga)
Man, I swear, verse by verse
I'ma make these weak rappers disperse (Weak nigga)
Man, I'ma get 'em, I'ma get 'em (Ayy)
Watch me get 'em, I'ma get 'em (Ayy)
I'ma get 'em, I'ma get 'em (Ayy)
Watch me get 'em, I'ma get 'em

[Outro]

Verse 1]
All you got to do is walk away and pass me by

How many bitches I gotta fuck tonight?
I'm thinkin' three but a nigga gotta catch a flight
I'm married to the money, gon' and throw the rice
Who you playin' games with? I ain't Fisher Price
I got 200 on the dash, I'm 'bout to run the lights
I put a million on that ass, I'm 'bout to change your life
I'm 'bout to bust a nut all over them pearly whites
Mean muggin' in that pussy, I ain't never nice

She like to play with that jungle

A formation, a nigga ain't gon' fumble
Right up in that hole, gorilla in that jungle

[Verse 1]
Villain, man, never ran with krills in his hand and
Won't stop rockin' til he clocked in a gazillion grand
Tillin' the wasteland sands
Raps on backs of treasure maps, stacks to the ceilin' fan
He rest when he's ashes
Ask 'em after ten miles in his ga-lashes, smashes stashes
Chip on his shoulder with a slip on holster
A clip, a folder and his grip on a boulder bolster
They supposed ta know, it show when his aura glow
Get from out the row, when he get dough it's horrible
Time is money, spend, waste, save, invest the fess
The ten case of cave a chicken chest S
Yes ya'll the dub will get ya trickles
The best ballers pitch in and rub to get a nickels
But tut tut, he about to change the price again
It go up each time he blow up like hydrogen
Villain here, have em shrillin' in fear
And won't stop top illin' til he a gazillionaire
Grillin' stare, yeah ya boy had drama
Got 'em on a mental plane, avoided bad karma
Once sold an inbred skinhead a nigga joke
Plus a brand new chrome smoker with the triggers broke
I thought I told 'em, "Firing pins was separate"
He find out later when he tries to go and rep it
Took a Jehovah money for a Arabic Torah
Charged an advance to translate it and ignored it, sorta
One monkey don't stop no slaughter
A junkie want ta cop a quarter ton, run for the border
Know the drill, it ain't worth the overkill
Flow skill, still there's no thrill
Villa bill ya ten K bills in his pilla
Villa, when it gets realer, split the skrilla with—

[Verse 2]
—Dilla, (Dilla) mix, mix, mix
Villain, his agenda is clear
Endin' this year with dividends to spare, here
It's not meant for the seein'
Went through the ceilin' after enterin' his center bein'
A new meanin' to sales through the roof
Guaranteed raw and saw his truth was truth, proof
It's the return of the tramp
Who do a duet jam when Ernest Goes To Camp
For the right earn - na'mean like Vern
We need some more oil for the machines to burn, learn
Jiminy crickets
He gets lucky like winnin' free tickets off SimplyLyrics
One man's waste is another man's soap
Sons fan base know the brotha man's dope
A real weirdo with a bugged rare flow
And the way his hair grow was ugly as a scarecrow
He wears a mask so the charge won't grab
On a rooftop with a large stone slab
Heads up, talk white and thought niggerish
Refuse to walk tight and got his off the vigorish
Black licorice and equally as yucky
How he handled the money was strictly Dan Stuckie
Monkey hustle, man on fire
Later for the date than the Hadron Collider
And cost more, it be seemin' like a style
DOOM leave the competition steamin' like a pile
Smile, ding! Sparklin' jewels
In effect like alternate side of the street parkin' rules
Fools, the roach was never dead
Live for a week, then dehydrate with a severed head
Instead it was depicted as flicked in
Split, the wicks lit

[Verse 1]
Villain, man, never ran with krills in his hand and
Won't stop rockin' til he clocked in a gazillion

[Verse 2]
—Dilla, (Dilla) mix, mix, mix
Do a deal for kicks and get rich quick
Sketch lyric, bet 'cha bottom nick on some vic
Ick from the drumstick, come with the dumb shtick
Sick slick, hidden in a book
The only way they find it if you're spittin' in a hook
Listen, don't look now, keep walkin'
Traded three beans for this cow, cheap talkin'
Hawk men stalkin' hear that we hawkin' often
Coughin' to a coffin, might as well scoff the pork then
He's like Worf, some say stronger though
Off the top Jay Strongbow, play along bro
Wear a mask like yo off the Gong Show
Flow slow as Mongo, Don Juan thong pro
For ya info when he's not practicin' Jim Crow
Or actressin' and some nympho bimbo
He's playin' Ray J the old tape
DOOM—well what can I say like JJ in a gold cape
Fill it to the rim like brim
Villain and ya won't find him in no gym
Probably a foggy bog with the frogs
With a dot on the guard as he squat on a log
Half cocked and half baked
Used to keep a full stock of work, half rocked and half shake
My mistake, sign a track agreement
For more G's than lines and cracks in the cement
In any event it's fake like wrestlin'
Get 'em like Jake The Snake on mescalines
Ahem, elixir for the dry throat
Tried to hit the high note, Villain since a itsy bitsy zygote
By remote, send in the meat wagon
Braggin' MC's packed in with they feets draggin'
These stats are staggerin'
Had his PhD in indiscreet street hagglin'
Villain, his agenda is clear
Endin' this year with dividends to spare, here
It's not meant for the seein'
Went through the ceilin' after enterin' his center bein'
A new meanin' to sales through the roof

Sons fan base know the brotha man's dope
A real weirdo with a bugged rare flow
And the way his hair grow was ugly as a scarecrow
He wears a mask so the charge won't grab
On a rooftop with a large stone slab
Heads up, talk white and thought niggerish
Refuse to walk tight and got his off the vigorish
Black licorice and equally as yucky
How he handled the money was strictly Dan Stuckie
Monkey hustle, man on fire
Later for the date than the Hadron Collider
And cost more, it be seemin' like a style
DOOM leave the competition steamin' like a pile
Smile, ding! Sparklin' jewels
In effect like alternate side of the street parkin' rules
Fools, the roach was never dead
Live for a week, then dehydrate with a severed head
Instead it was depicted as flicked in
Split, the wicks lit

[Chorus]
Oh, walk on the water-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, for me
Just for me baby, okay
Oh, there's always gon’ be pressure
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, okay
Pressure

[Verse 1]
Nothing's ever worse than work unnoticed
Freelance now, yeah, I guess you earned it
Life is only wishing we could load it
Level up, you've got to make a bonus
Mystic staring at his phone for oneness
Silver or black mirror, what’s the difference?
Imitation always gets a bad rep, man
Witches' brew had me on the first sip, man

[Bridge]
Smells like autumn, smells like leaves
You don't know that you'll rust and not belong so much
Then get left alone
Left alone

[Verse 2]
Cloud hidden and my whereabouts unknown
Cazadero got me wearing all camo
Decked in Patagonia, head to toe
Down for whatever, I think I let go
No more shoes and socks, I only rock sandals
I can't tell if I'm hip or getting old
I can't hear you, maybe you could change your tone
People tend to listen when they see your soul

[Chorus]
Oh, walk on the water-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, for me
Just for me baby, okay

[Outro]
Sometimes I think we are from the same place
No, I don't
What just happened, happened, happened, happened, happened, happened?

[Intro]
Yeah
It's about 3:47 in the morning right now

Gettin' money from lil' somethin' to heavyweight
The pack is wit' it, a bag of bitches in every state

To a heavy slate
See y'all can hate while me and Freddy laughin' to the bank
You're actin' what you ain't

Clique full of goons, who do not smile

Oh and to end it off, nigga Flocka died

[Intro]
Well I'm gonna give you 2 choices

Got the type of swagger, bitches have to stop (Yeah)

River money, you can call a nigga cash flow

Uh-uh and my gang so tight

Keep talkin', females, keep talkin' me
I just keep a bitch cut, meat market, please
Say freeze like fuck it, I'm defrostin', pap

And I do them hoes stone cold, Steve Austin
You ain't talkin' 'bout money, then you bluff or cheap talkin'
My team often tell me that we flossin'
Off in G4s, just, yeah, send reinforcements
Got crazy divas in my ish
And my car strapped like it's baby seaters in the whip
I don't play nowadays, bitches treatin' for a trick
Keep it money over bitches, won't repeat it for a chick
Yes, fresh all-white Adidas in the whip
And if you're talkin' 'bout weed then Orangina is my shit
A couple grand for a feature is a bitch
I'd hate to be you but you would love to be this
Peep this G shit, T Lanez, G shit
I bring the wave to them haters, make them haters seasick
All the diamonds legit, all vagina we pick
With your girl in my livin' room playin' WiiFit
Get popped like three zits then shot like three flicks
And my kicks Asian like Kimora Lee's tits, yeah
Tell the waiter she can order me this
We's rich, we don't even act accordingly
It's the Mr. Nigga-Pick-Out-Your-Arteries, bitch
I wish a nigga would try to slaughter me
Follow me, Twitter bitch
If you ain't got it, girl, get it, bitch
Make the bitch make you rich, sorta like that player shit
'Cause nowadays women only wanna play a pimp
They get the major, get paper, then play the pimp
That's why fly by, I be like, "Fuck a bitch"
After I fuck the bitch, I be like, "Fuck the bitch"
I run game, no cutter glitch, somethin' rich
Not tryna fuck, I'm tryna get head from your chick
And real talkin', I don't do it for the people
Fly through it I'm Knievel, Swine Flu, you need a needle
Car doors writin' suicide letters to the people
I ain't cool wit' the eagle, my juice call me beetle
Uh, beat it like I beat the pussy
Here's the heater, nigga, eat it like you eat the pussy
And y'all yappin', y'all never brought a heater to me
So long nappin' if they never brought the sleeper to me
They like, "Aw man, Tory Lanez be that Tarzan"
Pay him four grand, leave him laid up in a far land
Tory garage like a farm, baby, all Lambs
With no mirage, all menage, baby, all them
With no Nicki, nigga, bitches rollin' with me
So much grands in my pants that my pants can't fit me
So dance with me, I'm the black Lance Ricky
'Cause I'm somewhere out in Houston, I ain't talkin' 'bout Whitney
I jam swiftly, baddest bitches can't get me
Now these hoes payin' me to even let them stand with me
Damn it pans out, like highlighters I stand out
Boom, like retirement homes, I bring them grams out
And this is just a verse of what the man's 'bout
So keep talkin', boy the whole shit's planned out
Yup, I ride on 'em like a G2
Plus, I'm the smellin' like the shit, baby P.U
I'm on my P.Q.s, karats look pre-juiced
Grab your chick, yeah, and do the grown shit we do
Yeah, see I'm up ready from the zone, bitch

[Verse 1: N-Rimes]
My camp pull the mileage

The shadow of death is the path you accept
If you're passin' the threat I act and address your absentness
Steps (What up)
I will enable, first fatal works 'til you base the verse
Make you hate that pain or be breakin' your stable
Face it on earth
Opposin' the hoes or be open and swallow so stay alert (Uh-huh)
'Cause I motion to smoke 'em hopin' not to go to Maplehurst
'Cause my eyes on the fetty, I'm grindin' for plenty
You try my, I'm ready, you'll die if you're empty
So why even test me? (Why?)
And keep on resentin' the lesson, I'm guessin' you want it (What?)
So speak in my presence, you're gettin' the present I promise (Okay)
A snuff to your head and knee to your ribs (Uh-huh)
I flee to your crib and told you're momma "Speak to a kid" (Speak to him)
And after that you actin' wack
I pack up late to catch a fade
Slippin', you'll just have turn 

[?] pass the maze

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Choppin' bodies in garbage
Honest-hearted and all of them
Harvest, carvin', starve hearts and an arm and leg on an offerin'
Show up to your apartment, walk into the hall of it
Dartin' into the offices
Officer, often talkin'
I'm gone inside of the audits (What's up?)
Flawless, lawless and heartless
Started  

[?] with the dissin
Nigga missin' in a mission and hit you quicker than pixels'
Is you, is you, is you rippin'?
I got your bitch and I'm willin' to break her britches
I break my dick in
Strictly kickin' you chickens and bitches
Is wishin' that he'd ever stopped, but he never stops
Hella hot shots to your melon
Watch rocks in the hella hot

100 dudes like who the 

[?] is you?
Come at you, a homi', I break your body in 

[?] tombs

Pretender, why can't you be for real?
Ah baby
Pretender, why won't you believe in what you feel?

Go get out of my house
That's all I ever get from you
Ain't your family ties, in fact I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word
From those guys
But you know I don't give a light
I'm going to make out all right
I've got a sweetheart hand
To put a stop to all that
Snipin' and grousin' goin' on

[Chorus]
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Send your brother swimming with a brick
That's alright
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
She ain't no friend of mine
She ain't no friend of mine

Your momma and your daddy going to
Plague me until I die
Why can't they understand I'm just a
Peace loving guy

The waiting seems eternity, yeah
The day will dawn of sanity
Is this a kind of magic?
It's a kind of magic
There can be only one
It's a kind of magic
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done
This flame that burns inside of me
I'm hearing secret harmonies
It's a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
Hey

It's a kind of magic
A little bit of magic, give it to me!

A little bit of magic, everyone
Magic, magic, magic, magic

[Guitar Solo]

Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be, will soon be, will soon, will soon be done
Will soon be done

[Audience Applause]

[Audience Cheering & Clapping]

[Intro]
Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh

[Verse 1]
Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

[Bridge: Freddie Mercury]
Um ba ba be
Da ba be
De day da
Ee day da
That's okay

[Chorus]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out!"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets
Day day de mm hm
Da da da ba ba
Okay

[Verse 2]
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
Ee do ba be
Ee da ba ba ba
Um bo bo
Be lap
People on streets
Ee da de da de
People on streets
Ee da de da de da de da

[Chorus]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out"
Pray tomorrow gets me high, higher

[Bridge]
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why?
Love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

[Verse 3]
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

[Outro]
Because love's such an old-fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure

[Audience Applause]

[Spoken Word: Freddie Mercury]
I feel a little boogie coming on, what do you think?

[Audience Cheering]

[Spoken Word: Roger Taylor]
One! Two! Three! Four!

[Intro]
Hey, hey
You know what song
Get in the groove, babe

[Verse 1]
Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Freddie Mercury & (Audience)]
Yeah, yeah, sing it!
(Another one bites the dust)
One more!
(Another one bites the dust)
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

[Verse 2]
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Hey, hey, hey

[Chorus: Freddie Mercury & (Audience)]
Another one bites the dust
(Another one bites the dust)
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

[Audience Cheering]

[Interlude: Freddie Mercury & (Audience)]
Be-dop-bop-be-dop-bop-be, be-dop-bop-be-dop-bey
Be-dop-bop-be-dop-bop-be, be-dop-be-dop-be-dop-bey
Hey, hey everybody c'mon
Another one bites the dust, yeah

Bop-dop-bop-be-dop-bop-be-bop, be-dop-bop-be-dop-bop-be-dop-bop...

[Bridge]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Yeah, hey-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay

[Verse 3]
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad
And leave him when he's down, yeah
Yes I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating the sound of the beat
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust, hey
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Gotcha!

[Audience Applause]

[Spoken Word: Freddie Mercury]
You know something? There's been a lot of rumors lately... about a certain band called Queen. Rumors are that uh... the rumors are that we're going to split up. What do you think?

[Audience]
No!

[Spoken Word: Freddie Mercury]
They're talking from here

[Audience Applauds]

[Spoken Word: Freddie Mercury]
My apologies, but I say what I want. You know what I mean? So forget those rumors. We're going to stay together until we fucking well die. I'm sure of it

[Audience Applauds]

[Spoken Word: Freddie Mercury]
I keep-- I must tell you. I keep wanting to leave, but they won't let me. Also, I suppose-- we're not bad for four raging queens, are we, really? What do you think?

[Audience Cheers]

[Spoken Word: Freddie Mercury]
This is a new song. Who wants to live forever?

[Audience Applauds]

[Verse 1]
There's no time for us
There's no place for us
What is this thing that builds our dreams, yet slips away from us
Who wants to live forever
Who wants to live forever?
There's no chance for us
It's all decided for us
This world has only one sweet moment set aside for us

[Chorus]
Who wants to live forever?
Who dares to love forever?
Oh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Who wants to live forever?
Oh, oh yeah
When love must die

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
So touch my tears with your lips
Touch my world with your fingertips
And we can have forever
And we can love forever
Forever is our today

[Chorus]
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
Forever is our today
Who waits forever anyway?

[Audience Applauds]

[Audience Applause]

[Intro]
Hey!
Let's go!

[Verse 1: Freddie Mercury & (Audience)]
(I want to break free)
(I want to break free)I want to break free from your lies
You're so self-satisfied, I don't need you
I've got to break free
God knows, God knows I want to break free

[Verse 2: Freddie Mercury & (Audience)]
(I've fallen in love)
I've fallen in love for the first time
And this time I know it's for real
I've fallen in love, yeah
God knows, God knows I've fallen in love

[Bridge]
It's strange but it's true, yeah
I can't get over the way you love me like you do
But I have to be sure
When I walk out that door
Oh, how I want to be free, baby
Oh, how I want to be free
Oh, how I want to break free

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
But life still goes on
I can't get used to living without, living without
Living without you by my side
I don't want to live alone, yeah
God knows, got to make it on my own
So baby, can't you see?

[Outro]
God know I want to
God knows I want to
God knows I want to break free

[Audience Applause]

[Audience Cheering]

[Intro]
Here I stand
Look around, around, around, around
But you won't see me

[Verse 1]
Now I'm here
Now I'm there
I'm just a, just a new man!
Yes, you made me live again

[Verse 2]
A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright
And the people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight

[Verse 3]
Ooh, whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be
Don't worry, baby, I'm safe and sound
Down in the dungeon just Peaches and me
Don't I love you so
Yes, baby, you, me live again!
Let's go!
Yeah

[Verse 4]
A thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where the beams of your love-light chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With a rain running down my face

[Verse 5]
Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye
Down in the city just Hoople and me
Don't I love him so

[Guitar Solo]

Go Johnny, go!
Yeah

[Bridge]
Whatever comes of you and me
I love to leave my memory with you

[Outro]
Now I'm here
Think I'll stay around, around, around
We'll be down in the city just as you and me
You and me
Only you and me, babe

[Audience Applause]

[Spoken Word: Brian May]
This is the point where the guitarist gets to speak, now and again
Today, I don't have much to say except thank you very much for coming, and uh... making this the hottest ticket this country's ever seen. We love ya'

[Audience Applause]

[Acoustic Guitar Intro]

[Verse 1: Freddie Mercury]
Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart, and now you leave me

[Pre-Chorus: Audience]
Love of my life, can't you see?

[Chorus: Audience]
Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 2: Freddie Mercury]
Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love, you now desert me

[Pre-Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
Love of my life can't you see?

[Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

[Bridge: Freddie Mercury & (Audience)]
You will remember, when this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older, I will be there at your side, to remind you
How I still love you (I still love you)
I still love you

[Audience Cheering]

[Acoustic Guitar Interlude]

[Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
Oh, hurry back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

[Outro: Freddie Mercury & (Audience)]
(Love of my life)
Love of my life
Oooh, yeah

[Audience Applause]

[Acoustic Guitar Intro]

[Verse 1]
Just think of all those hungry mouths we have to feed
Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need

[Chorus]
Is this the world we created
We made it on our own
Is this the world we invaded
Against the law
So it seems in the end
Is this what we're all living for today
The world that we created

[Verse 2]
You know that everyday a helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by
Oh

[Chorus]
Is this the world we created
We made it on our own
Is this the world we devastated
Right to the bone
If there is a God in the sky looking down
What can he think of what we've done
To the world that He created

[Audience Applause]

[Intro: Freddie Mercury]
Okay, we're gonna fool around a bit, c'mon!

[Verse 1]
You don't like crazy music
You don't like rockin'
You just wanna go to a movie show
Sit there, holdin' hands

[Chorus]
You're so square
Baby I don't care
Doo whop
Doo whop
Doo whop
Doo whop

[Verse 2]
I don't care why my heart blips (Doo whop)
I only know it does (Doo whop)
I only wanna love you, baby
I guess it's just because

[Chorus]
You're so square
Baby I don't care
Doo whop
Doo whop
Doo whop
Doo whop

[Bridge]
You don't even know any dance steps
But I do
I only know why I love you
And I do, I do, a do, a do, a do

[Verse 3]
You don't like crazy music (Doo whop)
Don't like rockin', baby (Doo whop)
You just wanna go to a movie show
Sit there holdin' hands

[Chorus/Outro]
You're so square
(Doo Whop)
Baby I don't care
(Doo whop)
Baby I don't care
(Doo whop)
Baby I don't care, hey

[Chorus]
I said hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart

[Verse 1]
You passed me by one sunny day
Flashed those big brown eyes my way
I knew I wanted you forever more
Hey, I'm not one that get's around
Swear my feet stuck to the ground
And oh, I never did see you no more

[Chorus]
I said hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
One more time
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart

[Audience Applause]

[Spoken Word: Freddie Mercury]
Ay!
Ay, wait a minute
One minute!
I need my fucking- but I don't care. Let's go!

[Verse 1]
Bop bopa-a-lu a whop bam boo
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
A whop bop-a-lu a whop bam boo

[Verse 1]
I got a gal named Sue, she knows just what to do
I got a gal named Sue, she knows just what to do
She rock to the east, she rocks to the west
But she
