Real nigga, Twitter, what?

[Verse]
Royalty my partner them
No one else might partner them
Stay strapped with that arsenal
These niggas winnin', it's hard to tell
Move over, we about to take over
Slide up in them DMs, young nigga didn't even notice, I'm focused
I'm the man of the hour, play me on power
Play me on hot, nigga I'm hot, nigga don't stop
Flow so cold put a cherry on top
Haters so made he ain't even know why, probably all the autonomy
Father your feelings are proud of me, head was so good it's psychology

From that weird ass little kid to that grown ass 

[?] man
Man this beat is going so HAM, flow been burr since Novem
Chain been burr since Novem, that means cold, I'm just sayin', we ain't playin'

[?] hold it
See them titties, wanna motorboat it

Gettin' hype like that little girl whose like
Ay-Ay-Ay-Turnup!
(Never 3x)

[Verse 1]
You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down
You, you enchant me even when you're not around
If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down
I’m latching on, babe, now I know what I have found

[Bridge]
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?

[Chorus]
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

[Verse 2]
I'm so encaptured, got me wrapped up in your touch
Feel so enamored, hold me tight within your clutch
How do you do it? You got me losing every breath
What did you give me to make my heart bleed out my chest?

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Prop-proper
Come on, I gotcha
Have you ever seen a new helicopter?
Straight off the blocka
This little Nicki grew up to be monster
You deserve to be mama
Twinkle twinkle, her sparkle'll blind ya
You and me is a must, girl
You shy like the first day of school
Got me some weed if you cool on the booze
Lie on the couch while I drool on your boobs
Naw, I'm just kiddin', just kiddin' to you
Take you to heaven, pit stop at the moon
Stuntin' July til the month after June
Hang on my arm while we freeze up the room
Girl, you the bomb won't you take it and boom, boom

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I'm latching on to you
I won't let go of you
I'm latching on to you
I won't let go of you
I won't let go, I won't let go
I won't let go, I won't let go

[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the story of a young man who left everyone and everything he loved to chase his dream. A lil' nigga from North Carolina, Fayetnam to be exact. Packed up all his shit and moved to the big city of dreams, where he ain't know a motherfuckin' soul, and he ain't have a motherfuckin' thing, just a dollar and a dream.

This mixtape is provided partly in part by, Dreamville Records. Straight out the Ville where anything's possible. All-terrain music, that's Carolina's finest boy. And by any means, when ain't shit handed to you, you gotta take it. Without further ado ladies and gentlemen I proudly present to you, J. Cole, The Come Up.
You say this guy
This guy's in love with you
Yes I'm in love
Who looks at you the way I do
When you smile
I can tell
We know eachother very well
How can I show you
I'm glad
I got to know you
Cause

I've heard some talk
They say you think I'm fine
Yes I'm in love
And what I do to make you mine
Tell me now, is it so
Don't let me be the last to know
My hands are shaking
Don't let my heart be breaking
Cause
(interlude)

Tell me now, is it so
Don't let me be the last to know
My hands are shaking
Don't let my heart be breaking
Cause

I need your love
I want your love
Say you're in love, in love
With this guy

[Verse]
Why do they say that they know what's right for me?
Hey, I know what's right for me
Why do they say that they know what's right for me?
Hey, I know what's right for me

[Chorus]
I know what's right
I know what's right
I know what's right for me
I know what's right
I know what's right
I know what's right for me
(For me)

[Outro]
I know what's right for me
I know what's right for me
I know what's right for me
I know what's right for me

[Verse]
Livin' in my own world, I could never die
Ambition of a hundred kings livin' in the sky
Nothin' can stop me, no nothin' can stop me
My destiny tellin' me that God got me
Grace in my own greatness and I made this
Pandemonium and victory, I can taste it
Set me free, I wanna be set free
I wanna be remembered in my own legacy

[Hook]
We fight, we cry, we live, we die as kings
We multiply with gold, our hearts will bleed
You recognize this more than just my dream
Once you realize, you'll know what lies beneath
Know what lies beneath, know what lies beneath
Close your eyes and you'll realize you know what lies beneath

[Verse]
Nothin' can stop me, no nothin' can stop me
My destiny tellin' me that God got me
Came from darkness, I made it with sharpness
Back when I said that I tried my hardest
I will not lose, I paid my dues
I failed several times, I tied my shoes

[Verse 1]
(Hey)
Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play (Hey)
Hey, went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

[Pre-Chorus]
One day my father he told me
Son, don't let it slip away
He took me in his arms, I heard him say (Hey)
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid

[Chorus]
He said, one day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me

[Bridge]
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)

[Verse 2]
When thunderclouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shining stars
He said, go venture far beyond the shores
Don't forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home no matter where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
One day my father he told me
Son, don't let it slip away
When I was just a kid, I heard him say
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid

[Chorus]
He said, one day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me

[Bridge]
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
Oooh, oooh
(Hey, hey)

[Outro]
These are the nights that never die
My father told me
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
Oooh, oooh

(Hey, hey)
Oooh, oooh

[hook]

[Verse 2]
Gucci mane im a trapper b , I give three bad hoes to 

[?]

[hook]

[Verse]
See, I'm the man, tell 'em roger that
I got bitches shattering glasses trying to holla back
My pockets fat, if not they getting there
That's VIP, nigga, you'll never get in there
See, I inspire conversation with dollar signs
You either talking money or just remain the mime
She got a fat ass with an amazing mind
That mean great brain
I swear to God every time I pop off that I pop a vein
Now ain't that true love?
I tell her kill Cupid and give my crew love
And you ain't getting it 'til you get in that jew love
I'm talking Seinfeld, Ben Stiller, Wall Street, bank tellers
Tell 'em you couldn't bury with two cups
Papa need his courage or face eternal extortion
I harbor around the orbit on my Darth Vader
You'll see the light saber dropping jewels, Marc Jacobs
You know

[Verse 1]
I still wake up go and get it, youngin on a mission
Cuz when niggas was eating they left me to do the dishes
But I’m different, I still put ‘em on just to show ‘em right
I used to be the dark child but now I glow at night
I keep a Omelly by my side because we both alike
Try and keep that nigga out the field cuz he be throwin’ white
Dishin’ d, tryna get rich as me
I’m worth a couple million man that shit was meant to be
20 gold chains on, shit I think I’m Mr. T
If I could live my life again I wouldn’t do it differently
Prolly bring my father back, just so he could witness me
Back up in my zone I swear my haters is history
Bitches say they missin’ me, I never fall for it
Cuz they just miss the money, they know I go hard for it
And if my niggas need it, I tell ‘em come for it
Cuz when it comes to me, they shootin’ like a small forward, swish
My life is realer than I can explain
Shootin' out with killers and choppin' em things
Tryna make a killin from rockin the cake

[?] from the feds and niggas that dropping them names
They locked me in chains, niggas took shots with my frame
In Killadelphia were bodies be dropping like rain
Where bodies be dropping like rain
In Killadelphia were bodies be dropping like rain

[Verse 2]
I say that meek shall inherit the earth
So I’ma own this bitch until I’m buried in dirt
I only roll with nigga that'll carry me to my hearse
Blesses for my grandma, she carried me to that church
And I don’t know why, I just feel like I’m the one
They label me a victim but now look what I become
Or should I say became, I don’t do it for the fame
I’m from where they never make it but I went against the grain
Charges riding against my name, assasination to my character
Life’s a bitch, she cheated on me but I married her
Niggas getting murdered, this shit is getting scarier
Dodging all the pot holes, jumping all the barriers
And if she a bitch, I feel like I just got in that pussy
Shorty wanna be a star, that’s why she popping that pussy
She trying to win so she hang amongst winners
That’s why I take the time just to pray at mom’s dinner
Cause I remember, cold nights not the winter
Not the weather, I’m talk about within us
Cause for that money, sins they get committed
And friends they get to splittin', divided just like division
So eryday that I wake up, my undivided attention
It goes to getting that cake up and staying out of the prisons
The system made me stronger
And being broke just gave me my hunger
I'm gone!

[Chorus]
It's gonna be a heatwave
The sun is shining through the clouds
I put my love into your mouth
And I feel so high, I can't come down
A heatwave
I feel your magic on my skin
You dance around me in the wind
Open your heart and let me in

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna dance in the sunlight
Get me on my knees
I'm gonna kiss your body in the summer breeze
You got a killer smile and I love your steez
Come on kiss my body, I'm begging please

[Verse]
You are a super special, take me home
Our love extra special, tastes like gold
This is another level, oh my God
I know you need it 'cause you’re screaming

[Chorus]
It's gonna be a heatwave
The sun is shining through the clouds
I put my love into your mouth
And I feel so high, I can't come down
A heatwave
I feel your magic on my skin
You dance around me in the wind
Open your heart and let me in

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna dance in the sunlight
Get me on my knees
I'm gonna kiss your body in the summer breeze
You got a killer smile and I love your steez
Come on kiss my body, I'm begging please

[Bridge]
You know I like it
When we're playing in the summer breeze
I know you like to tease me
You've always got me on my knees
I'm falling for you more and more
Every time I stare into your buttercup eyes

[Outro]
I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
(I'm in love)

[Hook]
I expiriment with drugs im a guinne pig
I wallow in the mud I'm a guinne pig
Dirty money dirty money man im filty rich
Im filty rich, im filty rich

[Verse 1]
I could care less what you think of me
So I remember you played less through elementary
They get ragious like kobe but im not in the league
And from morning forever getting money way over seas
You not no O.G. so you can not hit my O.G. weed
Big gucci but LV's all over me, that's irony
So make your top tens I give a fuck where you place me
I got that blue-ray on my deuces come back HD

[Hook x2]

[verse 2]
I rolled a half of my blunt in 6 seconds
They say I just broke another world record
I sold your boy a half a chicken and a cherrie
And I pour lean up and don't measure
Bitches say that I'm just pleasure
I told that her trash another bitch treasure
I text my ex my new bitch pussy wetter
See the belt, shoes, and bag I'm getting cheddar

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Two rollies at the same time I'm too cool
Gucci is you locing? Cause that motherfucker crip blue
Soo woo Bentley and the Forgi's soo woo too
And I know two Jews eat a case like it's fast food
I bought a T-rex on these niggas cuz life's cruel
My jewels so cold that you might get the slight flu
Birds eye view, I'm looking down at the lil dudes
And if I had to pussy nigga I'd rob you
You wanna see me locked twenty four just like cops do
You hang from the side line this what your job do
Gang mentality I think like the mob do
Police brutality I'm strapped like a cop fool
My fo-fo's do numbers just like my shows do
My main bitch wanna fuck me just like my hoes do
These suckas say they comin' for me well cook me some soul food
I Mapquest your house and I pull up with a trunk full

[hook]
Birds eye view, I'm looking down at the lil dudes
And if I had to pussy nigga I'd rob you
You wanna see me locked twenty four just like cops do
You wanna see me locked twenty four just like cops do
Birds eye view, I'm looking down at the lil dudes
And if I had to pussy nigga I'd rob you
You wanna see me locked twenty four just like cops do
You wanna see me locked twenty four just like cops do

[Verse 2]
Rick James stoner a party nigga cocaine on the table
Had a foursome with three foreign girls they say they from Australia
I got molly, weed, and liquor, and a bunch of paraphernalia
I'm in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania making these hoes play Punchanella
Punchanella Punchanella made two best friends kiss each other
Eat each other fuck each other fucked her mouth then switch the rubber
On spaghetti junction with a boss that just came from Los Angeles
APD be trying to crucify a G but Gucci's no evangelist
Shootout piece tree woof and Big Meech
I see his mission I dare you to reach
Big dog status don't show me your teeth

[?] bummy g gon' be pushed with the beef
Innocent people get shot in the street
God blessed them me but Im not with them 

[?]
I'm ridin' with the niggas that pulling the triggas
That nigga that rob you they robbin' with me

[hook]
Birds eye view, I'm looking down at the lil dudes
And if I had to pussy nigga I'd rob you
You wanna see me locked twenty four just like cops do
You wanna see me locked twenty four just like cops do
Birds eye view, I'm looking down at the lil dudes
And if I had to pussy nigga I'd rob you
You wanna see me locked twenty four just like cops do

Baby, more iller than ammonia
Feeling tipsy from a bottle of Corona
Oh, no
I feel she bout to let go
Oh, oh
She said she wants to bring me to her world
She whispers some words that damn near made my toes curl
She said she's got that *shit* that I have never seen before
And if I get a taste I'll be coming right back for more

And that's when I noticed people are watching
But we don't care, the way I am touching your body
Cause we don't care, see you droppin' and poppin'
Like we don't care, makes me want to keep grinding
Like we don't care

(Oh, oh)
See I'm getting nasty with you on the dance floor
You got me going
(Oh, oh)
Could you be the reason why I'm losing control?
Fo sho, like we don't care

We dancing together like we belong in my bedroom
(In and out the sheets, what we doin' it on the dancefloor
If we share mattresses you leave me no headroom
(Loose as one can be and she's flaunting it, damn it's hardcore)

People are watching
But we don't care, the way I am touching your body
Cause we don't care, see you droppin' and poppin'
Like we don't care, makes me want to keep grinding
Like we don't care
(Oh, oh)
See I'm getting nasty with you on the dance floor
You got me going
(Oh, oh)
Could you be the reason why I'm losing control?
Fo sho, like we don't care

Fo sho, like we don't care
Fo sho, like we don't care
Fo sho, like we don't care

[Verse 1]
I know they wanna come and separate us
But they can't do us nothin'
You're the one I want and I'ma continue lovin'
Cause you're considered wife and I'm considered husband
And I'ma always be there for you
And either way you look at it, I ain't goin' nowhere from my muffin'
Cause she gonna hold it down, can't nobody tell her nothin'
That got the kind of love that always make a better fussin'
And that's what gets me closer to you

[Pre-Chorus]
And no one know why I'm into you
'Cause you'll never know what it's like to walk in our shoes
And no one know the things we've been through
Can never measure up to half of what I put you through
That's why we'll break through

[Chorus]
And I don't care what they say, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I wanna be with you
And I don't care what they do, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I'm gonna be with you

[Verse 2]
Seems like every day that go by, things are gettin' harder
Wanna be the one that give you the whole enchilada
Cause I know what my baby like, I lean you on that Prada
You ain't got to match with the shoes
All about knowin' you, I'm into doin' things to keep her longer
Stickin' together forever, watch you grow stronger
That's the way it has to be, everythin' proper
Keepin' it always true

[Pre-Chorus]
And no one know why I'm into you
Cause you'll never know what it's like to walk in our shoes
And no one know the things we've been through
Can never measure up to half of what I put you through
That's why we'll break through

[Chorus]
And I don't care what they say, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I wanna be with you
And I don't care what they do, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I'm gonna be with you

[Bridge]
You are everythin' in my life, see the joy you bring
And ain't no one I compare you to
And I know that you will never walk away from me no matter what
And that's why I plan to do the same thing for you
And I want you to know

[Chorus]
And I don't care what they say, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I wanna be with you
And I don't care what they do, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I'm gonna be with you

And I don't care what they say, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I wanna be with you
And I don't care what they do, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I'm gonna be with you
Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

I made the mark on February 1st
Between me and you, you can call it birth
The beginning of our universe
Remind me of Alicia Keys verse

I'm falling for you
I wish I had an opportunity to not do
What I did to hurt you
And now I'm here living with regrets

I know that it was my fault
I know that I got caught
So please don't lose your thoughts
Of me loving you and you loving me

I'm on the highway swerving
I ain't drunk but I'm about to hit the curb'n
Looking at the calendar getting nervous
Just a few more days to the first soul
This the day it all began
One place that it came together
More than a ring or a tattoo
Wish your birthmark that reminds me of you

So let's get on an airplane
Go back to where we began
To that point which is days apart
That stamp right next to your heart

To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart

To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart

Get the calendar, go to August 3rd
1st words stay, we heard our 1st words
First argument gotta let it go
Cause it could possibly affect what our future holds

Flipping pages now famous
Thinking back I ain't seen you in ages
Wishing that I coulda made it less painless
Brings me back right back to the same as
I know that it was my fault
I know that I got caught
So please don't lose your thoughts
Of me loving you and you loving me

I'm on the highway swerving
I ain't drunk but I'm about to hit the curb'n
Looking at the calendar getting nervous
Just a few more days to the first soul

This the day it all began
One place that it came together
More than a ring or a tattoo
Wish your birthmark that reminds me of you

So let's get on an airplane
Go back to where we began
To that point which is days apart
That stamp right next to your heart

To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart

To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart
January, February, March, April, May
June, July, August is just another day
September, October, November trying to find a way
In December to mark my calendar to meet again

If only we can go to that place where me and you know
There's no faith fronting cheating even lying
The time has come where we stand face to face

This the day it all began
One place that it came together
More than a ring or a tattoo
Wish your birthmark that reminds of you

So let's get on an airplane
Go back to where we began
To that point which is days apart
That stamp right next to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart

That stamp right next to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart

To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart
That stamp right next to your heart
I'm here at the crossroad
Where my life is heading? Man, I don't know
Should I stay or should I go?
Cause anything's better than what I've been through

What I would give to get a sign from up above?
Letting me know that everything would be okay
I wish someone would pull me off from out of the mud
Will anyone out there say to me

I'm here, for you
Don't worry cause I got you
Don't trip, don't stress
My life seems to be heading

Over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
The edge, the edge
Now everyday that goes by
I see things that'll make another man cry
I'm sitting wondering why
I can't find that someone to fit in my life

See I was searching, but am I worth it?
And did they ever think I'm good enough for love?
Despite my suffering I felt the loving
The blessing came when I needed it the most

And that's the sign that I received from up above
Letting me know that everything would be okay
And that was that something that pulled me out of the mud
And also was the one that said to me

I'm here, for you
Don't worry cause I got you
Don't trip, don't stress
My life seems to be heading

Over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
The edge, the edge
I'm here, for you
Don't worry cause I got you
Don't trip, don't stress
My life seems to be heading

Over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
The edge, the edge

I'm here, for you
Don't worry cause I got you
Don't trip, don't stress
My life seems to be heading

Over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
The edge, the edge

[Verse 1]
Im like a bird and I am so high
In my lair looking at the blue sky
Can't let another day pass by
Without you knowing what I feel inside
Cause its embedded in my soul
The day I stop will be the day I turn cold
Let you know I'm breaking out of that hole
And let go

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So I can be free to do what means most to me
And you can look back one day
And know I shared with you my gift
I hope you wouldn't think I just leave
Pack up and roll up my sleeve
Give it all up and live for nothing to take with me all I got to give

[Chorus]
Thats why
I just want to make you clap again
Just clap again
I just want to make you clap again
Just clap again
I just want to make you clap again
Just clap again
I just want to make you clap again
Just clap again

[Verse 2]
So if your life is twisted and ain't going right
Let's forget about it tonight
I just wanna make you happy baby
Dancing and clapping (dancing and clapping)
Cause we plan to be here till the morning light
Can you feel the change in your life?
Ain't it feeling like magic baby?
I'm the one that make it happen baby

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So you can be free to do what was meant to be
And you can look back one day
And know I shared with you my gift
Would you think I just leave?
Pack up and roll up my sleeve
Give it all up and live for nothing to take with me all I got to give

[Chorus]
I just want to make you clap again
Just clap again
I just want to make you clap again
Just clap again
I just want to make you clap again
Just clap again
I just want to make you clap again
Just clap again
I just want to make you clap again
Just clap again
I just want to make you clap again
Just clap again
I just want to make you clap again
Just clap again
I just want to make you clap again
Just clap again

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
I just want to make you clap again
Just clap again
I just want to make you clap again

I just want to make you clap again
Just clap again
I just want to make you clap again

[Verse 1]
The sand loves when the waves come
The sky can't wait for the light of the sun

[Refrain]
So how could you
Look me in my eye and not see what
What I feel inside
Tell me, how could you
Doubt the fact that I
I love you?
I love you

[Verse 2]
Don't you ever think like that
Don't you ever, never do that
There will never be two things
That go together better than you and me

[Pre-Chorus]
North needs South
East needs West
And no needs yes, yes, yes
Up needs down
Life needs death
And no needs yes, yes, yes

Don't you ever, never do that
There will never be two things

Like the desert needs the rain
Like joy needs pain

[Verse 1: Nathan]
Close your eyes, make a wish
And blow out the candlelight
For tonight is just your night
We're gonna celebrate, all through the night

[Verse 2: Shawn]
Pour the wine, light the fire
Girl, your wish is my command
I submit to your demands
I will do anything, girl, you need only ask

[Chorus: All]
I'll make love to you
Like you want me to
And I'll hold you tight
Baby, all through the night
I'll make love to you
When you want me to
And I will not let go
'Til you tell me to

[Verse 3: Wanya]
Girl, relax, let's go slow
I ain't got nowhere to go
I'm just gonna concentrate on you
Girl, are you ready? It's gonna be a long night
Throw your clothes (Throw your clothes)
On the floor (On the floor)

[Verse 4: Shawn & Wanya]
I'm gonna take my clothes off, too
I've made plans to be within you
Girl, whatever you ask me, you know, I could do

[Chorus: All]
I'll make love to you
Like you want me to
And I'll hold you tight
Baby, all through the night
I'll make love to you
When you want me to
And I will not let go
'Til you tell me to

[Bridge: Wanya]
Baby, tonight is your night
And I will do you right
Just make a wish on your night
Anything that you ask
I will give you the love of your life, your life, your life

[Chorus: All]
I'll make love to you (I'll make love)
Like you want me to
And I'll hold you tight (Hold you tight)
Baby, all through the night

'Til you tell me to (Tell me to, tell me baby)

[Hook: Young Thug]
She just wanna get this paper

Drinkin' purple and yellow, feelin' like a Laker
Thugger Thugger, OG Boo Dirty, we a Laker
Yeah I wanna know, we are a Laker
Fuckin' bitches, fuckin' bitches like we a Laker
Drinkin' purple and yellow mixed just like a Laker
I'm a Laker, Laker, Laker, yeah I'm a Laker
Livin' life like a Laker, rings on me like a Laker
She cummin' twice like a Laker, bought a hundred acres like a Laker
We started bein' goons, now we kings
I'm a young rich nigga with the same team

[Verse 1: OG Boo Dirty]
Aye Thugger Thugger roll up while I pour up the jelly
Sauced up like spaghetti, my bitch fine as Halle Berry
I hit it, stick it, stab it just like I was Freddy
And make that pussy sing to me... R Kelly
You niggas funnier than Jim Carrey
While I'm grindin' for my nicks, call me Raymond Felton
Drop a juice and get a quarter back like Jim Kelly
Choppers with machetes, I don't think you ready
My sack loud, you can't even turn it down
Smokin' out the pound while your bitch goin' down
My goons move in silence, they won't make a sound
We starvin' for the paper, fuck nigga we gettin' pounds

[Hook: Young Thug]
She just wanna get this paper
Yeah, stay away from all of these haters

[Verse 2: King Myers]
I'm livin' life just like a Laker
I be smokin' purple, drinkin' yellow Fanta
And I don't drink no Actavis
But I'm active when I'm in the Panamera
My niggas leanin', your niggas dreamin'
We Lakers, we got bitches screamin'
And all of 'em bad, none of 'em decent
When you think of the Lakers, you think of Kobe
So my niggas got 2 guns for the niggas that owe me
I far fetch
Schoolin' these niggas, give 'em Artest, now they want beef
Plenty women in the sea, like Derek, I fish when I need
I'm just tryna eat that whole meal, I'm grindin' for my own deal
We don't just get on the board, we break the board like O'Neal
I started trappin', but better at rappin'
All I had to do was make it happen, got sick of the Magic
And shout out to Jamal for the trap, you can't finesse a finesser
Gave you six racks, you should go buy your girl a real necklace
I could have fucked her, cause I'm ballin' like a Laker
I'm after this Kareem, ain't got no time for these haters

[Hook: Young Thug]
She just wanna get this paper

I'm a young rich nigga with the same team

[Intro: Chester Bennington]
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don’t understand
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
The sun doesn’t give light to the moon assuming
The moon's gonna owe it one

It makes me think of how you act to me you do
Favors then rapidly
You just turn around and start asking me about
Things that you want back from me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
You'll see it's not meant to be
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
You'll see it's not meant to be
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

I wanna, I wanna
I wanna, I wanna

[Verse 2: Baba Zumbi]
Two, two, three, three
Yo, yo, yo

Gimme Energon to keep me calm
You and your mom keep all the dram
Used to be a team, passed that baton
But you flop that bomb as you drop that bomb
Take it to the john in your Babylon
Flushed down with the sound that you carry on
I don’t really give a dang, you pissed on my lawn
Took a dump like a punk, now the battle’s on

So sick of you stressing, sick of you fessing
Sick of you acting like I owe you some
Find another place to feed your face
If you don’t, we gon’ bump, get it up, get crunk

Sick of you stressing, sick of you fessing
Sick of you acting like I owe you some
Find another place to feed your face
If you don’t, we gon’ bump, get it up, get crunk

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
You'll see it's not meant to be
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
You'll see it's not meant to be
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
You try to take the best of me
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me
You try to take the best of me, go away

You try to take the best of me
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me
You try to take the
Go!

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
Go away! You try to take the best of me!
Go away! You try to take the best of me!
Go away! You try to take the best of me!
Go away! You try to take the best of me!

Go away! You try to take the best of me!

Go away! You try to take the best of me!
Get away from me!

[Conversation]
AmpLive: Sounded really tasty man
Brad: Do you wanna work on Pushing Me Away? Or do you want me to tell you... that whether you think
AmpLive: We can work on Pushing Me Away
Mike: I tell you, Black Thought's gonna do his thing

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
We bitch and we fight
Diss each other on sight
But this thing we do
These times together
Rain or shine or stormy weather
This thing we do
With world-weary grace
We've taken our places
We could curse it or nurse it and give it a name
Or stay home by the fire, felled by desire
Stoking the flame
But we’re here for the ride

[Hook]
It's louder than words
This thing that we do
Louder than words
The way it unfurls
It's louder than words
The sum of our parts
The beat of our hearts
Is louder than words
Louder than words

[Verse 2]
The strings bend and slide
As the hours glide by
An old pair of shoes, your favorite blues
Gonna tap out the rhythm
Let's go with the flow, wherever it goes
We're more than alive

[Hook]
It's louder than words
This thing that we do
Louder than words
The way it unfurls
It's louder than words
The sum of our parts
The beat of our hearts
Is louder than words
Louder than words
This thing they call soul
Is there with a pulse
Louder than words
Louder than words

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
"Go to Heaven, Wright"

[Verse 1]
Tryna find a way to explain this
Why you can't touch me tonight
I can feel you gettin' impatient
But I really can't let you inside
Bad, how deep the pain is
Ooh, you just couldn't believe
And yeah I seem good on the surface
But I'm a mess, I'm a mess underneath

[Refrain]
See, winter took most of my heart
And spring punched me right in the stomach
Summer came lookin' for blood
And by autumn I was left with nothin'

[Chorus]
It took a whole damn year to repair my body
It took a whole damn year
It took a whole damn year to repair my body
It's been a bad five years
Gon' take a long, long year for me to trust somebody
Gon' take a long, long year
Gon' take a long, long year for me to touch somebody
It's been a bad five years

[Verse 2]
Not tryna do this on purpose
Boy, I really wish I could
Don't act like you never heard this
I know you haven't misunderstood
But the others just wouldn't respect it
Don't tell me you as well
I thought we were headed for Heaven
But you're 'bout to take me back to Hell

[Refrain]
See, winter took most of my heart
And spring punched me right in the stomach
Summer came lookin' for blood
And by autumn I was left with nothin'

[Chorus]
It took a whole damn year to repair my body
It took a whole damn year
It took a whole damn year to repair my body
It's been a bad five years
Gon' take a long, long year for me to trust somebody
Gon' take a long, long year
Gon' take a long, long year for me to touch somebody
It's been a bad five years
It took a whole damn year to repair my body
It took a whole damn year
It took a whole damn year to repair my body
It's been a bad five years
Gon' take a long, long year for me to trust somebody
Gon' take a long, long year
Gon' take a long, long year for me to touch somebody
It's been a bad five years

[Outro]
Bad to the liver, bad to the bone
Bad to the liver, bad to the bone
Bad to the liver, bad to the bone
It's been a bad five years

[Chorus 1]
Why would I spend the rest of my days unhappy?
Why would I spend the rest of this year alone?
When I can go therapy, when I can go therapy
When I can go therapy, two times a day

[Chorus 2]
Why would I spend the rest of this week so bitter?
And all that listenin' is makin' you bitter too
When I can go therapy, when I can go therapy
When I can go therapy, two times a day

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be around me
And I don't blame you if you're blocking all my calls
Been awhile since I've been sleeping soundly
Most nights I lie awake, between 2 and 4
Work is stressing me out
And after all this time, it's still never enough

[Chorus 1]
Why would I spend the rest of my days unhappy?
Why would I spend the rest of this year alone?
When I can go therapy, when I can go therapy
When I can go therapy, two times a day

[Verse 2]
I care more about what you think than I care about the music
When I get cross with you, I'm surprised you care at all
I figure if I had a lifetime of time left
Well shame on me if I don't get to use it well
Yeah I'm stressin' you out
And at the way it's goin', you'll need it more than me

[Chorus 1]
Why would I spend the rest of my days unhappy?
Why would I spend the rest of this year alone?
When I can go therapy, when I can go therapy
When I can go therapy, two times a day

[Bridge]
Someone, help me, turn me 'round
I'm a victim
Hate the sound of my own voice
Turn it down
And all I do is aggravate you

[Chorus 2]
Why would I spend the rest of my days so bitter?
And all that listenin' is makin' you bitter too
When I can go therapy, when I can go therapy
When I can go therapy, two times a day

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & Ronald Isley]
Is this mic on? (Hey, move this way, this way)
Hey, Hey! Hey! Turn the mic up, c'mon, c'mon
Is the mic on or not? I want the mic
We're bringing up nobody, nobody
Nobody but the number one rapper in the world
He done traveled all over the world
He came back just to give you some game
All of the little boys and girls, come up here
(Ah, one two, one two, what's happening, fool?)
Come right here, this is for you, come on up
I done been through a whole lot (Kendrick Lamar!)
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie (Make some noise, brother!)
Pray that the holy water don't go dry
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
And (I love myself)
Huh, when you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, huh

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
They wanna say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme, uh
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation (Come to the front, yeah)
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace (Oh, yeah)
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, wind could cry now
Look at me motherfucker I smile-

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
And (I love myself)
Uh, and when you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated—
All ya'll come to the front, ya'll come up to the front
(I love myself)
Baby what about you? Come on

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
(Crazy, what you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving, (Keep moving) turn the mic up
(Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, nigga

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
(I love myself)
Uh, and when you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Huh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy
(I love myself)

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Huh (Walk my bare feet) Huh (Walk my bare feet)
Huh (Down, down valley deep) Huh (Down, down valley deep)
(I love myself) Huh (Fi-fie-fo-fum) Huh (Fi-fie-fo-fum)
(I love myself) Huh (My heart undone) one, two, three

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it 'til I get it right (Oh no)
I went to war last night (Night, night, night, night)
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body—

[Spoken Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
(Offstage Argument)
Not on my, not while I'm up here
Not on my time, kill the music, not on my time
We could save that shit for the streets
We could save that shit, this for the kids, bro
2015, niggas tired of playin' victim, dog
Niggas ain't trying to play vic— TuTu, how many niggas we done lost?
How many— Yan-Yan, how many we done lost?
No for real, answer the que—, how many niggas we done lost bro?
This—, this year alone
Exactly, so we— we ain't got time to waste time, my nigga
Niggas gotta make time, bro
The judge make time, you know that, the judge make time, right?
The judge make time so it ain’t shit
It shouldn’t be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left, dog
On the dead homies, Charlie P, you know that, bro
You know that
It’s— it's mando, right, it's mando
And I s— I— And I— And I say this because I love you niggas, man
I love all my niggas, bro
Exac— enough said, enough said
And we gon' get back to the show and move on, because that shit petty, my nigga
Mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check
We gon' do some acapella shit before we get back to-
All my niggas listen, listen to this:

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase "fuck nigga"
He said, "Think about what you saying: "Fuck niggas"
No better than Samuel on the Django
No better than a white man with slave boats"
Sound like I needed some soul searching
My Pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; king royalty - wait listen
N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlook the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong
So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me, or say it no more
Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time
Kendrick Lamar, by far, realest Negus alive

[Intro: Chester Bennington]
Come on!

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I woke up in a dream today
To the cold of the static and put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore

A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
Even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm with you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes

With you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I hit you and you hit me back
And we fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
But when things go wrong, I pretend the past isn't real

Now I'm trapped in this memory
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
Even though you're close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm with you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes

With you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes

[Verse 3: Aceyalone & Chester Bennington]
(No) I won’t let you control my fate
While I’m holding the weight of the world on my conscience
(No) I won’t just sit here and wait
While you're weighing your options, you’re making a fool of me
(No) You didn’t dare try to say that you don’t care
And solemnly swear not to follow me there
(No) It ain’t like me to beg on my knees
"Oh please, oh baby, please", that’s not how I’m doing things
(No) No, I’m not upset, no, I’m not angry
I know love is love, love and sometimes it pains me
(No) With or without you, I’ll always be with you
You’ll never forget me, I’m keeping you with me
(No) No, I won’t let you take me to the end of my rope
While you burn it and torture my soul
(No) No, I’m not your puppet
And, no, no, no, I won’t let you go

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
No, no matter how far we’ve come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we've come
I, I can't wait to see tomorrow

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
With you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes

With you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes

[Verse 1]
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a good feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
20 on pump six dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
20 years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend all my ear into how to stack these residuals
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do
20 on 6, he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu, my American tongue was leery
Hopped out the gas station, a homeless man with 100 grand
Who passed me just asked for 10 grand, stressing about dry land
Blue skies, powder blue skies then crack open
Piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it, told him beat it
Contributed money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
He said "my son, temptation is one thing that I defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothing less, nothing more"
I told him I didn't have it then close my door
Tell me how much how much a dollar costs?
And this a freestyle beginning
And if you know me you know K.Dot TDE winning
We are the champions, we disagree
You can't see it then you best believe
This the cypher, I need y'all to throw some words up

[Interlude]
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't stop

[Verse 2]
They wanna know the question
K.Dot, everybody stressin'
This is the message that I'm kickin' too wicked, straight from Compton
If you come around my city you'll get stomped in
The neighborhood Watts and Long Beach
Boy, you out of reach
This is TDE, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock
Schoolboy Q, we hot, you not
This a freestyle off the top of the dome
Big Boy city, you know my home
I'mma represent every time I come to the lab
If you wanna see me, homeboy, get the cab
Cause you can't ride with me, you can't see the streets
You can't see us, it's TDE
My homeboy Dave gon' fly you straight in
Sippin' on that juice and gin and that's a classic
Coming straight from Dre and Snoop
If you want us please jump inside the group
Because you don't deserve it if you don't not
This is straight hip hop, this is off the top
And when I rock you feel it
If it's us and then you hear it
Please consider that the best agree
The top number one emcee

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Now when I flip it I flip the beat as my enemy
You thought it was taming me, on point like a widow's peak
Deliver the bars that everyone agree
They say the number one emcee, best believe
I love the pianos and I love the flow
I love the snare drum, I love... oh, I can't cuss on radio
Because if I do they just might let me go
I'm side to the best, I ride to the best
I represent the West, please don't try to test
Because you will get disabled
From best of flows I know, you hate it
Everybody wanna rock, but they can't
Because they come from the street of Rosecrans 

[?]
We drop it off the top of the backboard for real
And that's a swish, that's a net, alley oop
I feel that we are the champions and these Gods'll stomp you
I come through your block and crash everything that you want or put out to
And if you know my flow then you know how it go
If you know Death Row then you know Eazy, then you know Dre
Then you know Snoop and you know we don't play
But anyway I need y'all to flip the beat
Because my words always compete with the best

[Interlude]

[Verse 4]
I said we don't stop, boy, we run hip hop
Boy, we run rap, boy, this is Top Dawg
D-O-T, D-A-W-G, K-D-O-T, C-P-T
L-B-C West, W-A-T-T-S, Jay Rock, he don't play
Niggas and guards, projects
What you want? We can collide anytime with the biceps
But this ain't no strong arm, buddy, this just a freestyle
Off top of the brain, boy, you know I get wild
You know I'm so foul, you know I'm off of the top
You know this hip hop, you know I cropped
The roof from the birth of the Earth
And I've been doing this since church
With the small slacks, with the soft suspender
If you rapping like that, homeboy, we suspend ya
We contenders, we on the top off the map
We on the top off the globe and yeah this real rap
From the bottom of the soil since Adidas and Run DMC
Sprinting like cheetahs, we run this game and beat me
And 

[?] man on the beat right now
He gon' flip it and please believe
Every 16 bars is like ours
And if you want it then we 'bout to take charge, what's up?

[Verse 5]
Tonight's the night I jump off my shit
Deep cover on the incognito tip
And every time the words flip the emcees step, but I don't trip
I keep walking, keep pushing and put 'em in a coffin
You often looking for the best, I'm here
We talking, you looking for the stress, you there
Keep walking, you looking for the West, right here
You stalking the flow, you often to know
I want y'all to know been doing this since the days of Death Row and Ruthless
I've been ruthless, the coupe it been roofless
You spit, the words be toothless
But it get like that because you feel it
I got Rikki on my side and she chillin'
Big Boy on my side and he willin'
They say that he writing my bars, forget it

[Interlude]

[Verse 6: Big Boy]
It's my lyrics, it's my pen
It's my paper as I begin
I've been writing for Kendrick for a long time
And he's been reciting my rhymes
So for those out there who didn't know
Big Boy gets on the mic and he kicks an ill flow
Then about 10 years ago I got this call
From a little dude, I said "yes, yes, y'all"
He said "uncle Big Boy, I wanna start rapping"
I said "what's up, little homie?", he said "I wanna start trapping
I wanna start capping, I wanna start hitting the studio"
I said "slow down a little bit, bro"
He said "holler, I wanna rock the spot"
I said "what's your name?", he said "my name is K.Dot"
I said "K.Dot, okay, I think I feel you
But this the way I wanna instill you
First off let me write what you gon' say
Record it and then press play"
He said "okay", it was very rude that I took K.Dot on
He was one of my little students
So he just sat in class
He was looking at me, said "do I get a pass?
Do I get an A,B,C,D,E or do I fail?"
I said "you doing well", his head started to swell
Then all of a sudden he came to me
He said "there's this dude in Compton that has TDE"
I said " Top Dawg? Hold on, that is my partner
Don't stop right there because I think 

[?]"
When the dude is coming with a contract
But I said "hold on, let me look at that"
I said "okay, he want this, he wants these points
He want this, but don't smoke any joints
You my lil partna, how old are you on the scene?"
He said "big boy I been a student, about, I'm about sixteen"
I said okay keep going, and then all of a sudden
He started doing uhh, he started doing these shows
And he got poetic, he got energetic
Spotetic, all those -etics
Any more -etics, any more edits
Then o-etics, and then a o-etics
So then I came back and he was still in class
And then I gave em that pass
I said TDE, the real Macoy
Can't forget Jay Rock, can't forget Schoolboy
And so I put the whole crew together, but from the background
Before I got in they had a lack sound

[Intro]
She know how I do
She know how I do
She know how I do

[Verse]
Uh, hoes love us
Bitches, we be them niggas wit' gold bottles and gold rubbers
Pause, I'm that nigga women in an awe
Figures 'cause all my figures lost bitches on they jaw
Uh, y'all can't be that nigga for too long
Been smokin' loud then got these bitches on the bong
She fucked around and landed in the place of G niggas
I push that six, don't blow my shit out the street, nigga
I keep figures big as the shits I'm takin' on motherfuckers
Just wait, I got my paper straight, I make this motherfucker
Wit' all my niggas, bottled liquor for my favorite women
Don't hate, I make your chick undress to meet my favorite linen
Been in different situations wit' different types of women
She know this life I live excitin', plus I ball like ain't no type of spendin'
And it be the swave how I took her from ya
'Cause niggas crook, it ain't no Brooklyn ballin'
That's the swish and cushion callin' women, I be
Swaved out, dime, double, glazed out
Time froze, couldn't even make the fuckin' face out, uh
But shawty, I'm for real now
She ain't wear ice but still we told her she can chill out

[Outro]
She ain't comin' late
'Cause this a motherfuckin' G party
Don't you be mistaken
Don't pull up to the club wit' ya shawty
'Cause she gon' get taken, taken
'Cause this a motherfuckin' G party
She gon' get taken, taken
'Cause this a motherfuckin' G party

[Verse]
Yeah, that's cool
Thirty two shots in the clip of his thirty four's a little nigga with heart
Frustrated with being broke while I was climbing the charts
Penitentiary chancin' and dancin' with suicide

[?] is connoisseurs, love to eat on our tribe
Homie I got love for him
Angel on angel dust, I used to thug for him
Took me on my first mission, transition
Good kid turned rapper, pay attention
This is deeper than you think
Right after my admission inside the game, asked him bout whats his name
We brushed it off as a joke as we watched her get off the stage
Music award 

[?] for all of the nominee
I was promised to win, he was promised to leave
With all the favorite accessories
The one's the big budget videos had especially
Just a shadow in the dark, blendin' in with all the industry friends
So guess this is where the story begins, J Incredible, what!

[Question:
Are you still competitive in the rap game?]

[Answer:]
Uhhm, competition is different these days
That competition is competing for my awesome fan base
My awesome fans
Attention, you know what I mean
For them to still say that they love me
And competing for they love and competing for them to still fucking with me
Things like that
That’s my competition these days and I love it

[Verse 1]
Someday I'll find her
And I'm still reminded
Maybe she's best in dreams
She's still the best I've seen

[Chorus]
Dreamin'
Dreamin'
Dreamin'
Baby, I'm dreamin'

[Verse 2]
Out on her windowsill
Baby remember
Maybe I'm out of luck
Maybe it's running still

[Chorus]
Dreamin'
Dreamin'
Dreamin'
Baby, I'm dreamin'

[Intro: Chester Bennington & Phoenix Orion]
Grafitti sky

I don’t think you’re all ready
Yo, I don’t think y'all ready

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Graffiti decorations under a sky of grey
This constant apprehension still giving me away
The lessons I've forgotten in spite of all I've learned

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Now, I find myself in question
Point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
Point, point the finger at me again

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I wanna run away (I wanna run away)
I wanna know the truth (I wanna know the truth)
I wanna know the answers (I wanna know the answers)
I wanna shut the door (And open up my mind)
And open up my mind (And open up my mind)

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Paper bags and angry voices under a sky of grey
This constant apprehension won't seem to go away
All my talk of starting over, these words were never true

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Now, I find myself in question
Point, point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
Point, point the finger at me again

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I wanna run away (I wanna run away)
I wanna know the truth (I wanna know the truth)
I wanna know the answers (I wanna know the answers)
I wanna shut the door (And open up my mind)
And open up my mind, and open up my mind

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Gonna run away, gonna run away, way
Gonna run away, gonna run away, way, way
Run away

[Verse 3: Phoenix Orion]
Hey, uh, y’all not ready
Hey, yo
I don’t think y’all ready for what I’m about to do
Y'all new school dudes ain’t even got no clue
How dare you forget about Bam and Zulu?
Kool Herc and Jazzy J, they paved the way
Let me spit it to y’all who said I wasn’t gon' make it
Every time I blaze it, y’all the first to hate it
My team ain't lookin' supreme to stay strong
Got the true series son, they scared to put us on
Can’t get with hybrids, get off your hiatus
Too many of y’all is dying for it so I gotta blaze it
Still repping BK, Brooklyn, B and on
Hell-fighting family, alienation
Banging hits in the backyard on a LP song
I’m a little communicator, Phoenix Orion

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I wanna run away (I wanna run away)
I wanna know the truth (I wanna know the truth)
I wanna know the answers (I wanna know the answers)
I wanna shut the door (And open up my mind)
And open up my mind, and open up my mind

[Verse 1]
Never feel too good in crowds
With folks around, when they're playing
The anthems of rape culture loud
Crude and proud, creatures baying
All I've ever done is hide
From our times, when you're near me
Honey, when you kill the lights and kiss my eyes
I feel like a person for a moment of my life

[Pre-Chorus]
But you don't know what hell you put me through
To have someone kiss the skin that crawls from you
To feel your weight in arms I'd never use
It's the God that heroin prays to

[Chorus]
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh, to be alone with you

[Refrain 1]
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
There are questions I can't ask
Now at last, the worst is over
See the way you hold yourself
Reel against, your body's borders
I know that you hate this place
Not a trace of me would argue
Honey, we should run away, oh someday
Our baby and her momma, and the damaged love she made

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't know what else that I would do
Than to try to kiss the skin that crawls from you
Than feel your weight in arms I'd never use
It's the god that heroin prays to

[Chorus]
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh, to be alone with you

[Refrain 2]
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
Feels good, girl, it feels good
Feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh, to be alone with you

[Chorus]
Uh, it's all good 'til that ride go low
And the hoes you was fuckin', they don't slide no more
That's why I'm on this I-95 alone
Ridin' with the windows down, tryna sip it down now, uh
I think about it when I'm high, oh no
Like I don't even expect you to ride no more
Guess I can't worry 'bout nothin' but mine no ,ore
That's why I'm on this I-95 like no no no no no
It's like nothin' all over now
West side girls, where the fuck you been?
If you really know a nigga, holla at me then

[Verse]
Am I still fuckin' with these bitches?
Told myself I wouldn't but she's here inside my livin' room
Same slick dress on, lipstick pressed on
Gave a couple reasons why she ain't for bein' slept on
Killer in the line of that outfit designer they just came out with
She got a problem maxin' out my card, I hardly doubt it
That's why I'm out in all these malls tryna call accountants
And any time she do me wrong, I start to fuck more 'bout it
Bitches that's down to stripin' down to they slickest outfits
And they just wanna fuck the kid with kicks that ain't come out yet
And I'm just livin' life, no chaser, lemon spice
Young entertainer, livin' life just like I'm Evan White
Pacin' all my blatant move
Like from the line and shootin' threes, you could be takin' twos
You know you greater so you just do what you made to do
Fuck what they say dog?
Just pray to God and make it through, now make your moves, nigga

[Chorus]
Uh, it's all good 'til that ride go low
And the hoes you was fuckin', they don't slide no more
That's why I'm on this I-95 alone
Ridin' with the windows down, tryna sip it down now, uh
I think about it when I'm high, oh no
Like I don't even expect you to ride no more
Guess I can't worry 'bout nothin' but mine no ,ore
That's why I'm on this I-95 like no no no no no
That's why I'm on this I-95 like no no no no no
West side girls, where the fuck you been?
If you really know a nigga, holla at me then

[Intro: Aaron Lewis, Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Crawling in my skin
Crawling in my skin
Without a sense of confidence
Consuming, confusing
Crawling in my skin
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there’s just too much pressure to take
There’s something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Crawling in my skin, crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal, these wounds won't heal
Fear is how I fall, fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real
Confusing what is real

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control, I fear is never ending
Controlling, I can’t seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
It’s haunting how I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]
Without a sense of confidence
Without a sense of confidence
Without a sense of confidence
I’m convinced that there’s just too much pressure to take
Without a sense of confidence
Without a sense of confidence
Without a sense of confidence
I’m convinced that there’s just too much pressure to take

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

[Chorus]
My mama always told me I would have the hits
She wasn't alive to see me have a hit
Had to make decisions, go and hit the road
That was back when Keisha nearly had a kid

[Verse 1]
Nigga, had to sell about a quarter ounce
Sold pop of front of somethin' like a whole ounce
He said, "Why you never get to see me at the crib?"
Step mama moved in, nigga, so I bounced
Real shit, if I had to sell a quarter water
Only thing I gotta do I get rent pay
Told the teachers, nigga, I'ma be a fuckin' rebel
Dropped out next week, that was 10th grade
Yeah, rich young nigga, I came up
Told you niggas I would get my change up
Put 7 8 9 10 chains up
Fuck the 'gram, this show me where I came from
Yeah, know we in the place
Hit the Ricky Bobby with the .40 on my waist
Gold grill shinin' like a Rollie in my face
I just hit a point like I'm Kobe with the play
Talkin' to the kid, dawg, niggas pissed off
But we came here after the plays lift off
Nigga, you are now talkin' to the kid, foo'
Lot of niggas talk the shit but they ain't really with the shit
For a rich nigga, rich nigga
All my niggas stars, when you see us
You are lookin' at a big dipper
Oh boy, oh God, let a nigga win, we gon' buy the whole store
One Umbrella, yeah
I told you niggas, I told you niggas

[Chorus]
My mama always told me I would have the hits
She wasn't alive to see me have a hit
Had to make decisions, go and hit the road
Young black nigga stickin' to the code

[Verse 2]
Had a court case I done tossed that
Couple ex bitches I divorced that
I remember when I could not afford that
Couldn't even sign for it, had to forge that
Yeah, money on my mind, got the ambition and the grind
Hang a fuck nigga like he dryin'
One twelfth rhyme
'Bout to order steak with the fries
Used to eat the Maruchan chicken with the side, one time
Every nigga workin' in the trap
Pray to Lord, help you if you servin' with the strap
Wait, J., you know I deserve me a plaque
If it ain't comin' to me, nigga, I murder a track
I'm a rich young nigga from the 416
Same bitches hatin', they be on my dick
Every year boy, we real heavy over here, boy
I waited for my time, now the shit is finally here, boy

[Interlude]
Finally here, boy
My niggas finally here, boy
All the shit up in a year, boy
Standin' right here boy
It's clear boy
When I step up in the airport, hold up, yeah
Wall to wall money, I done did it
Nigga, I'm the truth and I admit it
Contracts gettin' written, I'm the nigga
Air Jordan, my nation, Scottie Pippen
Killas on the payroll
They'll shoot it if I say so
2014, I ain't really for the beef
I just want the fuckin' peso
Yeah, and the cheese with the queso
100 Gs in the case, Lord
We was just some lil niggas last year
Playin' with them lil things off safe mode
Young nigga, had to get the money and the funds quicker
I don't wanna have niggas sleepin' on my shit
After a nigga dropped this one

[Verse 3]
Im talking his and hers beamers for me and my side bitches
Calvin Klein pictures in all my design scriptures
Made alot of money just spitting what’s flying richer
So nggas try and lay low just hope that they lie in ditches
Im killing these nggas
George Forman in the 6 how I'm grilling these niggas
Yall like to play games and say names never to me directly
Just someone connected next to me, yall ain't got the heart so you try and talk on the reg to me
Niggas steady claim that they got it
Tried to use my name in some product til I found out
Shit is crazy I made it, from the bottom and told the Dot that i got em
Some niggas just ain’t believe me, but shit they couldn’t see it like Stevie
With the keys, but he still played them
And Jesus ain’t start with believers, but he still made em
I had to make some change, I made my dollars then I made my name
I’m never letting this fame let me change
I’m courtside a couple Lakers games
I’m always in some block a hater frames
Or some, gold and you see wanna rob a players chains
These niggas is like Destiny’s Child tryna say my name
Its worth it, I lay your hearse with purpose
These niggas put me on the hook cause they scared of my verses
And I can kill your best written while spitting my worst shit
Young rich and gifted nigga my writtens in cursive, listen
Yall taking bout them high tone women glowing skin tint purses
Already got my iPhone 6 with the Sprint Service
At sixteen in a limosines with the tint service
2015 its hard not commit murder
When i pull up, hop out, bringing the backwood up
Niggas hated last year now they saying what up
You was not around when i was selling the cook up
Or roaming downtown without a home to hook up
Grandma basically told me to find a corner
Little did I know I’d be selling that marijauna
Little did I know it would turn into that Madonna
Little did I know I’d be selling right on Spadina
Little did I know I would roll into local diners, to try and find me a sandwich or something
Cause this hunger from my heart is moving down to my stomach
Shit I’m scarred, trying to find myself on this fucking boulevard
It’s Fargo

[Verse 1]
This is just a nightmare
Soon I'm going to wake up
Someone's gonna bring me 'round
Running from the bombers
Hiding in the forest
Running through the fields
Laying flat on the ground
Just like everybody
Stepping over heads
Running from the underground

[Refrain]
This is your warning, four minute warning

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna know
I just wanna run and hide
This is just a nightmare
But soon I'm gonna wake up
Someone's gonna bring me 'round

[Refrain]
This is our warning, four minute warning

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I'd like to thank everybody for coming out tonight
I'd like to share with you, my celebrity scenarios
I promise I won't tell baby girl
I can hold water, I promise

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I got this girl named Meagan Good
Well, you could say that Meagan was bad
The way she talk dirty he done threw me the ass
Like a quarterback Mr. McNabb
She introduce me to her friend Teairra Mari
Well, see Mari put a nigga to sleep
She made her boy feel good even curled my feet
Now please don't go back to Jay-Z
It's a rap, I used to fuck with Christina a while back
Which one, Aguilera or Milian, both of em
They did this little trick with their tongue
I came faster than a NASCAR spinning backwards
Brandi like to suck it she said she needed some practice
In the back of my bucket wasn't using no mattress
Brooke Valentine like to take it from behind
Face down, ass up, shit I love it when she climb

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Now we can all be celebrity cousins
And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin'
Now we can all be celebrity cousins
And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin' else
I promise, I won't tell nobody else
I promise, I swear I won't say nothin' else
I promise, just take off your clothes, nobody'll know
Psych

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
And about Vivica
I had her way before 50 Cent start dissing her
One thing I know, shit I hope he wasn't kissing her
Man she could blow like a torch
And dick without using a fork
She introduced me to Gabrielle of course
Union, had her on my backyard porch
Legs up film rolling, action, cut
She looking at me like "what happened, get up"

[?] fucked up so Holly came
Shit I felt that I lucked up
Gave her my last name, Trina moved on
She fucking with Lil Wayne now
It's OK, I ain't crying about my hand-me-downs
I'ma sit back, take it for what it's worth
But for now I'm free, "can you please lift up your skirt?"
We can do lunch, later on be dessert
I'll give you a job, since 106 didn't work
Out

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Now we can all be celebrity cousins
And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin'
Now we can all be celebrity cousins
And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin' else
I promise, I won't tell nobody else
I promise, I swear I won't say nothin' else
I promise, just take off your clothes, nobody'll know
Psych

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Ciara gave a nigga the goodies love tonight
And Bow Wow wants to see my cars out the house

[?] nigga maybe wanted to fight
He seen the burner on the draw and walked right out
Will Smith knows exactly what I'm talkin' bout
I had the same altercations when dealing with Jada
Baby momma drama I start fucking Fantasia
Nothing serious, she thought of it as a favour
And Lindsay Lohan, made my shit stand up
Like a Voltron, I couldn't keep my pants up
The Pussycat Dolls want the fantasy of all
Like, I'ma need some help trying to fuck all of y'all
Hour later, that's when Amerie called
Saying "this just one thing"
OK ma, "you don't have to fiend for the ding-a-ling"
I'll be over there, make sure Eve over there
I wanna see y'all mingling together

[Bridge]
Remember that time at my house
Remember that time at your house
Remember that time on the bed
Remember that time on the couch
Remember that time on the chair
Remember when Nelly was downstairs
We all had a good time
Didn't we all have fun
As celebrities can we?

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Now we can all be celebrity cousins
And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin'
Now we can all be celebrity cousins
And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin' else
I promise, I won't tell nobody else
I promise, I swear I won't say nothin' else
I promise, just take off your clothes, nobody'll know
Psych

[Intro: Riz MC]
Can you do me a favour bruv?
Could you get the beat up in my headphones please?
Yep, get it up a bit more please, in my headphones
Yeah,  wicked, alright, listen, okay

[Verse 1: Riz MC]
Listen up, listen Glov, kids and up, give us love
Sick cause ya, click a buzz, in the light, yeah bruv
Whether in cinemas or in the club spittin' fast
In my element like -- in a skinhead bar
Riz is not the type of spitter, to write a bit of shit about the bitches, ice and glitter
I find it limiting, I'd rather print the bigger picture
Them bars are boring like they only pouring pints of bitter
Yes, I'm an actor but I'm realer than most
Won battles and had the best choke, put fear in they throats
Songs banned cause the lines are so bold
I drop science and flow, so the album's called Microscope
And it's rougher than the road to Guantanamo
Switch like bricks on the latch that go from alcohol to powder nose
Sniff up her lips, on the prowl for coke, but the dealer was shifty, sold him a load of panadol
Rappers so fashion school, look like Timmy Mallet do
Mallet you, push your pineapple till you Agadoo
Battle you, serve you red rub, why? (Ha!)
Cause you be layin' backwards as Malibu
Shit's ruthless like Trishner's abusers
Manners are ill -- banks are too rich
Troops dig deep in the Middle East, bruisin' for crude, lootin' black gold for blue chips
But are you, as thin as a toothpick? Through two bricks and a few ticks, gets a few years
We werent blinded by knobs like the -- resign, but hoes a bonus when the dude quits
I got views, make political music, money and gun rappers are sayin' what Fox News is
Get money and buy shit, anybody who tries it should die
Why are rappers so right-wing?
Food for thought, do you avoid diet?
I'm on the Wu-Tang tour so chew on my four tyres
People confuse me for Rooney, no lie
Think I'm the star from 3, but I mean 4 lions

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Uh, girls text me after shows, I wanna call 'em all
Got some goons to hold my money, must be ballin' hard
Had a tour, I broke my foot, I had to brawl it off
"I ain't heard nothin' yet, man, Gambino must've fallen off."
Nah, never that, dawg, run it back
Back to chillin' on Memorial and Harrison
Mama, no more Arizona Jeans, that shit's embarrasin', I got a Truffaut jacket and me and my brother sharin' it
Anythin' they hand us, minivans and bandannas
That Wickes voucher stuntin', I think 'bout my cousin
Every time I spit an ill verse, like that time we talked about which Power Ranger that we'd kill first, that shit was so funny man, that shit was no money
Pyjamas and oatmeal, way you livin' is so real
Need a Nobel prize, for them coke deals, I thought co-tell, right?
Them boys you been fuckin' with, now they busy beefin' cause they see you on some other shit? Not to mention the government
I ain't trynna see you on the first 48
Wonder if God hears when an atheist prays
I don't know what to say, man that better change quick
Women love to spit, love women who swallow you
Makin' me, I won't woo when they mention your album
I don't know what I should tell them: That we royalty? That they spoil me?
Pretty girls on the grass with some champagne, all I do is win and make Azealia's last name
Is -- gonna go and make his own lane? Man, I hope so, shit is so cut throat
Brought a knife to a gun show, brought a gun to a bear fight
Grizzly bear screams in my hair when I say "night."
Cause I don't wanna make moves that they all regret, I just wanna make something that they all respect
Go on, let 'em know woo

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Ayo, Ghost, you crazy for this one, man
Ha, East End Empire
Let's get this one real quick
Trick or treat, muhfuckers

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yo, look
I'm pickin' a fight, deliver this, finna get rid of your life
Isn't it nice? I'm rippin' it once, it's hittin' you twice
Ghost deliver it nice, so take it as a present (You know)
Fuck sittin' in college, I kick this knowledge for the lesson
It burn ya chest, the words are blessed, confuse and bring ya questions
'Cause with my complexion (Yep), a fingernail could cut the tension
And in case I didn't mention: spittin' it better than anyone did it before (Uh-huh)
I'm rippin your corpse (Yep), dippin' and lettin' you live in the morgue
Shit on the porch, trick or treat, I'm here to piss on the floor
And if I didn't come with the whip, I'm gettin' in yours (Gimme that)
On Devil's Night, we bless the track
Mischief, so we rest from raps
Steal your soul, snatch your heart, laugh and let your chest collapse
I'm dressed in black, ready to run up inside your crib
Smack you upside the head while you sittin' beside your kid
I laugh 'cause your son's in my history class
Make him cry while he see his dad kissin' my ass (Haha)
Spittin' razor sharp cancer, so I'm pissin' out glass
Sit and relax, you bitches stay and live in the past
And here's a toast to me and Ghost
We be the dopest with this rhyme skill (You know)

[?] explode like you wander through a minefield
Time kill itself, clock blowin' out his brains
'Cause you are the Average Joes and John Does without a name (Cheah)

[Interlude 1: Ghosty]
Yeah, hand over them candy bags and all that shit (All of it)
Okay, yo
Aight, yo

[Verse 2: Ghosty]
It's like now for a word from a motherfuckin' scholar (Uh-huh)
Late October, homie, I was born a monster (Monster)
Blowin' on that ganja, just listen, don't hate the rhymes

[?] and them dimes 

[?]
I'm Frankenstein, brother
So I wonder what the talk's about, playa, watch your mouth
A small amount of Ghost will turn your crib into a haunted house (Uh-huh)
I'm on your spouse, dick on her blouse, jizz on the couch
I put you on game 'cause in my brain, it's stickin' out
So pick a different route, you 

[?]
A slender cat, I'm one of the skeletons in your closet (Yeah)
Our shit is speculator, see you still MC Dracula
Still approach beef with the spatula
The black cat scratches like NASDAQ
I'm past crack, I 

[?] duckin' in tents
They might despise, I see a fire and I'm 

[?]
We got the nicest lines and 

[?]

[Interlude 2: Mac Miller & Ghosty]
Yeah, y'all know what it is
Hey, Ghost, let's give 'em sixteen more (Oh yeah?)
Of this straight hip-hop monster shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
(Ah, we definitely got this shit, man)
East End Empire, let's get it

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
I'm ready to vote, my 

[?] and dro up in my bags
Got a scale to weigh it out, my paper route, I'm gettin' cash

[Verse 4: Ghosty]
Crew is 

[?] for you healthy rappin' clowns
Smack you down, crack your crown, 

[?]

[Verse 5: Mac Miller]
You don't wanna talk shit to us (Nope)
We live to bust heads with these fisticuffs
Then dap you like, "What up?" (What up?), just to pick you up
'Cause we splittin' cup while you spittin' butt

[Verse 6: Ghosty]
Matter fact, your clique is 

[?] (Ass)

[?] ridiculous, knock you out with the verbal
Smellin' 

[?], twist it up, cook a track, whip it up (Uh-huh)
Hook that ass, fix him up
I think I'ma skip the shit you spit, nigga, I'm into 

[?]

[Verse 7: Mac Miller]
Yo, let's wrap it up
I think we made a point and that's enough
Ghost and Mac is rough, so muhfuckers start backin' up (Cheah)

[Verse 8: Ghosty]
Man, your squad is 

[?] enough
Don't start actin' up like your sinuses and vagina lips
I'm inclined to spit

[Outro: Ghosty]
Yeah, all day, man
East End Empire, The Ill Spoken, The Scholars
I see you 

[?]
What up, Beedie?
Big Will, all y'all, what's good?
Franchise
Oh, and I made the beat, bitch

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
So what you trying to do to me
It's like we can't stop, we're enemies
But we get along when I'm inside you
You're like a drug that's killing me
I cut you out entirely
But I get so high when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down, rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
So if I run, it's not enough
You're still in my head, forever stuck
So you can do what you wanna do
I love your lies, I'll eat 'em up
But don't deny the animal
That comes alive when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down, rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
Don't tell no lie, lie, lie, lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No girl don't lie, lie, lie, lie (No, no, don't lie)
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny (You can't deny)
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
This is pain, this is love, this is sent from above
This a gift from the Gods, this was meant to be
You can run, you can hide, you can front, you can lie
But in time you gon' find you was meant for me
You a part of me and I'm a part of you
I'm addicted, one hit won't do I need a lot of you
Overdosing, your potion has got me floating on cloud nine
Tell me what I'm supposed to do when I run out of you, I'm through
I need a fix like d-boys need bricks
And plus whips to transport 'em
J. Cole, I seen it tall, you can't short 'em
One more time together
I hope your new man don't mind, girl you're mine forever

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Oww!
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Outro: Adam Levine]
Don't tell no lie, lie, lie, lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No girl don't lie, lie, lie, lie (No, no, don't lie)
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny (You can't deny)
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Big Mac, big sack, like this, like that
Big man on campus, I'll be right back
Like Mike, like Mac, my life, my bike
Menace, mo' bid'ness, in the beginnin a po' student
But ended up bein a chemist
24/7, Devin my nigga committed
Classmates, ended up as my road dawg
I showed him how to live, how to ball 'til we fall
Harder it is, make you much smarter dawg
Follow instructions, changed up the dialogue
Manifest no stress, life is a big test
Will you fail? Or will you pass? Smoke grass, trim trees
Tryin to find some air to breathe
Miss her, please baby baby please
Diplomas, gowns, caps and degrees
These are necessities in life you need so I'ma get it
Focus, committed
15 years later, but yeah a nigga finally did it
Uh, now who's to say in life there's ups no downs?
And when you get up, you gotta get down
Uh, and when you get up, look around
And don't frown on the ones that's down - just give 'em a hand
It's like mixin fixin up pots and pans
Listen up, I'm poppin like rockin a band
No plan, all from the heart to the hand
We gon' roll it, smoke it and do it again
I'm the apprentice, back on my pimp shit
Roll it, puff it, now give it to him
Uh, physical fitness, smokin relentless
Nouns and pronouns, they make up my sentence
High school days, uh
Blowin on the purple haze, uh
High school days, uh
Blowin on the purple haze, uh (where you at Devin?)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
And you know everywhere that we go
If it's Dev or it's Mac then we blowin by the O
Uhh, niggas know me for rollin the O-Z
Or somewhere low-key twistin a whole bush
And if I got it then you can get it, it's on us
Smoke so much pot that they'll probably give me my own kush
We blow about a zone, break it down blow it out a bone
Come to my crib I'll show you how to roll, bro
And my pocket's lookin kinda swole
Me and Mac smokin grade A, honor roll
Now all of the teachers on us
They gon' have contact cause I keep the bombest
Car automatic, don't need a key to start it
Know it's us just because of the weed aroma
Lookin for me nigga I'm in the tree department
With a doobie rolled up in the secret compartment
Tryin to finish up this speech and get my diploma
So I can get a crib where my OG can harvest and my niggas can ball
I'm talkin so much weed that the shit on the walls
If it start growin in the spring it gets picked in the fall
I'm used to goin to every class but I'm missin them all
Fuckin with Mac smokin spliffs in the halls singin this song
Like, niggas know me (know me)
Blowin on the OG (OG)
Niggas know me (know me)
Blowin on the OG (OG)

[Outro]
Niggas know me, hahaha
High school nigga
Dev and Mac, Mac and Dev
Put it in a zag
Put it in a blunt
Do what you want, uhh

[Verse 1]
So tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes
No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight
Soul deep in this swill with the most familiar of swine
For reasons wretched and divine

[Verse 2]
She blows out of nowhere, a roman candle of the wild
Laughing her way through my feeble disguise
No other version of me I would rather be tonight
And Lord, she found me just in time

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done
I need to be youthfully felt 'cause, God, I never felt young

[Chorus]
She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care
We'll steal her Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

[Verse 3]
Lord, it'd be great to find a place we could escape sometime
Me and my Isis growing black irises in the sunshine
Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside
We'd sit back and watch the world go by

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Happy to lie back, watch it burn and rust
We tried the world; good God, it wasn't for us

[Chorus]
She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care
We'll steal her Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
Cut clean from the dream at night, let my mind reset
Looking up from a cigarette, she's already left
I start digging up the yard for what's left of me in our little vignette
For whatever poor soul is coming next

[Chorus]
She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care
We'll steal her Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

Make him break bread, kick in for the shit
Run him off cuz he been was a bitch
It's a big ass hood but it's a small ass clique
(Look), full of real niggas and we hate fakes
Round table, politicking on the late late
Can't run a nigga credit then he ain't straight
Gang of volunteer killers and they can't wait
I'm from where they cut holes in the gate
Take him to the back, and expose if he's fake
Point Blank, shoot a hole in his face
No weapon, no witness, that's the whole in this case
Look, county jail front line with a shank
S Gang, neighborhood in they face
Homies left got detained to the state
But I kept it that way in a whole different tank
Roll it up, you a whole different game

(work it harder, make it better, do it faster, makes us stronger)
What's going on? Could this be my understanding
(more than ever, hour after, our work is never over)
It's not your fault, I was being too demanding
(work it harder, make it better, do it faster, makes us stronger)
I must admit, it's my pride that made me distant
(more than ever, hour after, our work is never over)
All because I hope that you'd be someone different
(work it harder, make it better, do it faster, makes us stronger)
There's not much I know about you
(more than ever, hour after, our work is never over)
Fear will always make you blind
(work it harder, make it better, do it faster, makes us stronger)
But the answer is in clear view
(more than ever, hour after, our work is never over)
It's amazing what you'll find face to face
It's amazing what you'll find face to face
It's amazing what you'll find face to face
It's amazing what you'll find face to face
It's amazing what you'll find face to face
It's amazing what you'll find face to face
It's amazing what you'll find face to face

Our work is never over
(work it harder, make it better, do it faster, makes us stronger)
I turned away because I thought you were the problem
(more than ever, hour after, our work is never over)
Tried to forget until I hit the bottom
(work it harder, make it better, do it faster, makes us stronger)
But when I faced you, in my blank confusion
(more than ever, hour after, our work is never over)
I realized you weren't wrong; It was mere illusion
(work it harder, make it better, do it faster, makes us stronger)
It really didn't make sense
(more than ever, hour after, our work is never over)
Just to leave this unresolved
(work it harder, make it better, do it faster, makes us stronger)
It's not hard to go the distance
(more than ever, hour after, our work is never over)
When you finally get involved face to face

Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over

Just the exam, so that I know
Who's down with the B-I-double G
Big "S" on they chest
And, yes, he the best
Kush, no cess, bush, new set
Lime's loaded, beats exploded
Shit's so funky, it's corroded
I brought it, Broadus wrote it
Quote it, devote it
Put it in a note, still reads: "Don't"
Doctor's orders
Middle fingers up cause we don't give a fuck
One million down and we still on the come-up
West Fest TV, and every Tuesday
All of y'all can see me
Underground heat, too hot
Shit what we do, this is a preview
I will GGN you, shall I continue the menu?
It's all green, welcome to the home team
No hooks, straight jabs
And Todd says, "Hey, dude, Saul back"
Nevermind, clever mind
I reinvented myself seven times
Goin' on eight, wait, motherfucker
Open the gate and let the dogs out
Smokin' KK in the doghouse
Lights out, go to bed
And this shit was straight off the motherfuckin' head
I'm a gladiator, Hercules
Blowin' with the purple leaves
Blue violets and daffodils
Real pimp, bitch, with the mack appeal
Signin' off, I'm through with it

Pussy nigga thirsty

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Young niggas with these old dubs
Got a young bitch and I'm hood rich
My old money for this new club
In this strip club getting group hugs
I got busy kids, I got fresh weed
Party real hard on Venice Beach
458 Italia, cut ain’t nothing Italian about me
The last nigga you had he spared ya
Baby girl I'll overwork ya
Ain’t nothing can prepare ya, and I ain’t even trying to scare ya
When you walk around the 6 be careful
These niggas might snatch your hair from you
Tell your mother say a prayer
'Cause a nigga might snatch your air from ya
Let me tell ya something about me
Thirteen year old's already a O.G
Selling big weed
Big bra send me thirty P’s
Steal the shirt right off your back 'cause I'm a fucking thief
J's off the street, call me black with the gold teeth
Pistol whip your cousin now a nigga got both teeth
Keep it brief, where you speak
'Cause you talkin' to a chief
Shootin' like no Chief Keef
Kick you with your own feet
Shoot you with yo own gun
Running from your own peace
Rob ya dead put some change on yo kill you with your own cheese
Long money, long gun short pace and short sleaze
Brick and a brick, man, I put that in my Rollie

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Brick and a brick, man, I put that in my Rollie
Brick and a brick, man, I put that in my Rollie
Brick and a brick, bri-bri-brick and a brick
Bri-bri-brick and a brick, man, I put that in my Rollie
Brick and a brick, man, I put that in my Rollie
Brick and a brick, man, I put that in my Rollie
Brick and a brick and a brick and a brick
Then I put, then I, then I put that in my Rollie

[Verse 2: Blaze Servin]
She goin' Pedro
My Migos no Quavo
Diego got yayo
My bitch looking like J-Lo
My diamonds Bugatti
They drive like a fossil
Got bucks like Jabari
God damn, my plug in Milwaukee
I got nuggets like Quincy Miller
I'm dealing, go figure
I throw it like Philip Rivers from SD to fillers
Got them houses like 

[?]
Got them dolphins from Florida
I own them Hornets like Jordan
Now you think I copped this foreign
Sellin' brick after bricky
My Rollie watch match my pinkie
I'm gettin' bread like I'm pinkie
I'm smoking kush and I'm stinkin'
Flipping bricks
Hittin' licks
Hunnids blue like a Crip
Red bottoms on my kicks
On my way to chop the bricky

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Brick and a brick, man, I put that in my Rollie
Brick and a brick, man, I put that in my Rollie
Brick and a brick, bri-bri-brick and a brick
Bri-bri-brick and a brick, man, I put that in my Rollie
Brick and a brick, man, I put that in my Rollie
Brick and a brick, man, I put that in my Rollie
Brick and a brick and a brick and a brick
Then I put, then I, then I put that in my Rollie

In and out that booty, ham sandwich
Young, new killer, bitch, your nigga old like BlackPlanet
Strapped up, pistol with the bandanas
Extended clip, gotta hide it from the damn cameras
Man, I'm only smokin' Cali kush
When I'm on the plane, they got your bitch rollin' the blunts, I call it high standards
Chucks with my Locs on
Pretty girls, tell 'em ugly bitches, "Go home"
You know, they comin' for the money and the real niggas

Talkin' fish scales like a whole salmon

Just gettin' started, nigga, don't panic
If you a star, I'm a whole planet
Acting like she won't get it
Have her run through the team like Jerome Bettis
You don't want it, don't look for it
Have your bitch on a surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
If you want this money, gotta work for it
Puff puff pass, what you lookin' at?
Bust it wide open, make it nasty

[Chorus: French Montana]
Shawty fell in love with a hustler

[Intro]
We was just some little niggas
On and off the corner
Just wanna be a baller
I was just a little nigga
Just a little nigga
And I hit my lil lick
Same day I got rich
Then I

[Verse]
Had to drop 600 on the whip
Young nigga comin' out the 6, nigga (Where am I?)
Grandma kicked a nigga out the crib
Now where the fuck am I supposed to live, nigga?
Oh God help a nigga get it how I live
'Cause I was in the kitchen with the whip, nigga
Young nigga found out quick
This trappin' shit ain't really where it is, nigga
I just want my money when I come in the bank
Fishin' for the snitches like there's one in the tank
See the teller talkin' when I come to the bank
See I'm the realest, number 1 in the ring
You know, I had it fly for a new wrist
Jack tripper bubble cup, paint cool whip
These niggas try to hit me with a full clip
I admit it I was slippin' on the bullshit
Then I hopped in it
Fitted with my niggas, talkin' armageddon
Yeah what come around, goin' back around
But I ain't got the time to let the karma get him
Nigga, did it for a new wrist
Had to put him on a news clip
Went from workin' down at Mickey D's
To eatin' out at the Ruth Chris
The roaches would crawl at my crib on the floor
Man, I came up from nothin'
Was 14 and rollin' with niggas so cold that it ain't no discussion
Bought me a .40, I got me a .40, hope cops don't come for me
When you live up in that jungle them niggas try shot for your lonely
I'm up in the 600
My mind on that quick money
I just did my T-4
Now motherfuck my PO
I'm whippin' that box foreign
You talk but your bitches is not foreign
I'm the kid with the benefits
Don't make me that kid with the Glock .40

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, I just wanna tell you somethin'
Somethin' about it, somethin' about it
Real nigga, I come from this real shit
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hey, you're something, this is the discussion
Daddy was a rollin' stone and I was just a youngin'
Mama she was broken, we ain't have too much of nothin'
Little sister cryin', dry your eyes girl, I'll go hustlin' just to get it

[Chorus]
Just dry your eyes, oh dry your eyes
Even I'd do wrong to make this life go right

[Verse 2]
Loner, motherfuckin' stoner
Mama say my clothes, they smell like resin marijuana
My reply is, "Mama, blame it on that corner"
Puttin' food up on the table and some ache up in my order
Mama I'm a soldier, .44 by my scrotum
Promise you won't cry when I go sell that soap and soda, oh no no

[Chorus]
Just dry your eyes, oh dry your eyes
Even I'd do wrong to make this life go right

[Intro]
No, I believe nothing in art is inappropriate. I paint what I see
We're going to have to insist that the face be removed
Absolutely not
Look, you son of a bitch

[Chorus]
Same clothes on me for a week straight
Pray the Lord help me for my peep's sake
When my mama died, I became a soldier
Papa couldn't save him, I was out there gettin' paper, hol' up
Same clothes on me for a week straight
Pray the Lord help me for my peep's sake
When my mama died, I became a soldier
Papa couldn't save him, I was out there gettin' paper, hol' up

[Verse 1]
MAC-11, barcodes in my arsenal
Lil' nigga Lost Cause, Arg Fargo
Pray to Lord every night, repentin' every weekend
We was really in the beef and I was really reachin'
Colt .45, bands from my younger peers
See my older niggas die up in they younger years
Ask my brother what the fuck I'm supposed to tell his mother
Know his sister and his cousin, plus his little brother
So we ride for him, caravan slide door
Just the team, just some beef my mother cry for
Copin' with the pain, smokin' in the rain
Movin' Macaulay Culkin, hopin' that it chain

[Chorus]
Same clothes on me for a week straight
Pray the Lord help me for my peep's sake
When my mama died, I became a soldier
Papa couldn't save him, I was out there gettin' paper, hol' up

[Verse 2]
Should we ride 'til the wheels fall
Pay these tickets for your biscuit if it's will call
And when this thief come and tell you I'ma lil dog
Stone cold, we just wanted that control, lil nigga, hold up
I'm with my niggas rollin' in this whip, it's stolen
Off a fifth of Hogan, if you chick is scoldin'
The whip get open and your bitch get open
Shit, this shit is sinister, ain't it ironic
My pops was a minister, nigga
For that side, I will ride, I will finish a nigga
Catch them how I rolled 'em
Shootin' photos of the job, hold it
Young Fargo, I'm just tryna let it all go, listen

[Chorus]
Same clothes on me for a week straight
Pray the Lord help me for my peep's sake
When my mama died, I became a soldier
Papa couldn't save him, I was out there gettin' paper, hol' up

[Verse 3]
Lil sister cryin', she got multiple structures
Takin' needles every night just to hold a discussion
You don't know that pain nigga you don't know that rain
Beggin' niggas for they change, you don't know that shame
You never fucked up on a re-up you don't know that change
Walkin' in The Dot, nigga, you ain't show that chain
You ain't sleep in no park, you had a home to stay
I was down and dirty, tryna get a pound of 30
Niggas hated on me, threw dirt on my name
There's hurt in my veins, lightin' this purple the flame
I'm confused in this lost world
My daddy's daughter was a lost girl
And she my sister, she love me when I was younger
And told me fuck with the music
Instead of holdin' my gun up
She told me that maybe if I prayed
He gon' bring the sun up for me
Tryna switch the situation with this gun up on me

[Verse 1]
I remember I was 9 when my brother used to rhyme
Used to see him spit, switch flows, and hold nines
Seen the same bro catch case and hold time
All that made me wanna do is continue his prime
As a youngin' all I wanted was to be that nigga
All they did was look at you and be like, "He that nigga"
Older brother, older son of mother
One I would look up to in the source
Hopin' that one day you'd be the one I would turn into
I figured it was just a figment of imagination
The magic made this moment happen
Look at me grow with your stature
After all these years, they had you waitin'
In that cell while niggas givin' you hell, I knew you was still basin'
And when them cells close and spite cover your eyes
I just pray God let light cover your skies
Hope your inner stressin' don't mess with you inside
Keep holdin' your head high
It's a blessing in disguise, my nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
Things don't always go, always go your way
I know everything that shine ain't gold
And we might think we're close
But even we can be far away
I know everything that shine ain't gold

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Everything that shine ain't gold
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (And it ain't gold)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (And it ain't gold)
Everything that shine ain't gold

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Things don't always go, always go your way
I know everything that shine ain't gold
And we might think we're close
But even we can be far away
I know everything that shine ain't gold

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Everything that shine ain't gold
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (And it ain't gold)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (And it ain't gold)
Everything that shine ain't gold
With It

[Verse 1]
Shawty, you don't understand me
I'll buy that ticket and fly yo ass straight to Miami
You always, you always got it
You always, you always got it
And I'm just, I'm just, I'm keepin' it real
'Cause you know that this shit, wait
'Cause you know that this shit real
Young nigga, big deal
See me ridin' in a drop top
Lil nigga, big wheels
And she fuckin' with it
You know that this shit real
It's a big deal
And Fargo be ridin' around lookin' for what you got
So just say oh with it

[Chorus]
When the drinks all gone and the weeds all done
And all you got is me and all you got is, say oh with it
When the drinks all gone and the weeds all done
And all you got is me and all you got is, say oh with it
Say oh with it, say oh with it, say oh with it
Say oh with it, say oh with it, say oh with it
Say oh
Say oh with it

[Bridge]
You always, you always got it
You always, you always got it
You always, you always got it

[Chorus]
When the drinks all gone and the weeds all done
And all you got is me and all you got is, say oh with it
When the drinks all gone and the weeds all done
And all you got is me and all you got is, say oh with it
Say oh with it, say oh with it, say oh with it
Say oh with it, say oh with it, say oh with it
Say oh
Say oh with it

We Did It

[Verse]
We did it
We did it, at the Marquis, under your sheets, up in your suite
We did it yeah, like a ball player, on them floor seats
Let me be your inspiration, yes when I'm tipsy, baby
Ooh I'm so tempted baby, but you like that don't you?
Hot in here with ventilation
Got you here, there ain’t no waitin'
Stop right there, now let me face ya
But you like that don't you?
Girl, I'm all for it
All I ask of you is take it off for me
I got a lot to give, take it off for me
Let me fall for you, you could fall for me
Yeah, oh no no
We did it yeah, yeah
Oh no no
We did it yeah, yeah

[Part I: Selfish]

[Intro]
Tell me is that
Tell me is that

[Chorus]
I'm not 'bout to lie on it
We don't even talk, oh no no more
So I'm not 'bout to lie on it
You can't be no one else's
'Cause I'm selfish, I'm selfish
I don't wanna be selfish
Tell me is it selfish? Am I selfish?
I don't wanna be selfish
Tell me is that selfish?
Tell me is that selfish?

[Verse 1]
Short black nigga in the Benzo
Dutch rolled in the endzone
Who you with when it ain't me?
Girl, don't try to put me in the friendzone
Young nigga, still ride with 'em on the low low
I Benz drop with the Hunna low low
Look, you my chick, let her full trick
While am still shootin' with numerous shots from the .44
I done moved on
But I don't want you to go home
I don't I want you to move on
I don't want you to see me at the light
But you do and I got another you on my futon
All in together, Jane and Finch where I met her
Thinkin' 'bout it all in the present
That was that 4-1
I would never forfeit on bullshit
And you would never fold for my cheddar
I was young successful, young and reckless
Runnin' reckless, tryna find the time to check it
It was wrong, I thought that time would tell
But damn, I fucked it up, and now I guess I'm just
Selfish, I'm selfish
'Cause I moved on and I don't want you boo
Selfish, I'm selfish
When I move on and I don't want you too
I'm selfish, I'm selfish
Just a young unlucky motherfucker in a Bimmer
I need ya to myself and then I leave ya
I did the same shit with Tina, Gina, Ashley and even Leena
Believe me, this shit hard but I make it look easy
For the go, got the crack on the low
You leave and I'm back in for more, young nigga

[Chorus]
I'm not 'bout to lie on it
We don't even talk, oh no no more
So I'm not 'bout to lie on it
You can't be no one else's
'Cause I'm selfish, I'm selfish
I don't wanna be selfish
Tell me is it selfish? Am I selfish?
I don't wanna be selfish
Tell me is that selfish?
Tell me is that selfish?

[Verse 2]
Was thinkin' of the days when
We was teens in a basement
100 V's in the case uh
Young nigga with a dream, just chasin'
Big cake, lil nigga, no birthday
Backwood for the worst day
With a 1 back then I would back when
I was in the city of my my birthplace
Young girl runnin' with the keys to my heart
Shit hard but my heart so cold that it key wouldn't start it
Made a pact to my bosses
That if it don't go right I'ma keep you apart
In the future, it sound loose but it's truthful
And I ain't stupid, I know you out there lookin' for
Somethin' new but I know you still missin' what you used to
Love and lust and sex and trust and next is guess
I fucked it up and yes I know I will regret the extra stuff
Well stop me there 'cause that's enough
Been young and wild, we take for granted
All the things you planted in this life, we know you made for us
It's dangerous just to maintain us, babe, look uh
I'm the nigga out there
I don't know what was salty at all
But you know shit different out there
Back then, I was always downtown like I'm livin' out there
Nigga, these days I be in a new Lear
New key cup, blue pool clear
Only thing missin' is a bad one
Fuck that only thing missin' girl is you here
I been I be tryna front though
Only tellin' ain’t nobody I can front for
Yeah, when I'm runnin' right back on the low
Got the crack for the low
When you leave then I'm back in for more, young nigga

[Chorus]
I'm not 'bout to lie on it
We don't even talk, oh no no more
So I'm not 'bout to lie on it
You can't be no one else's
'Cause I'm selfish, I'm selfish
I don't wanna be selfish
Tell me is it selfish? Am I selfish?
I don't wanna be selfish
Tell me is that selfish?
Tell me is that selfish?

Part II: York University

[Verse]
Young nigga ridin' up and down the boulevard
I know I fucked up, yeah, it's all my fault
If it was up to me, it wouldn't be this hard
If it was up to me, we'd be inside your dorm room
Fuckin' just like we inside your dorm room
You'll remember me, I put it on you, oh oh
Take Steeles all the way down to York University to put it on you
I'm the one that you was with first time that you smoked weed
I put it on you
And I'm back out here at York University
Why am I trying to find you
What if it's not you but the feelin' of you
That always reminds me
That I'm right back here at York University
Where we used to try
Hopin' one more day we can try

[Intro]
This One Umbrella mob is nothin' to fuck with

[Verse 1]
Ay bitch, I'm back in here to show you I'm the nigga
All in the VIP, them bitches know you as the nigga
From the corner sellin' dope and buyin' Swishers
Every night I pray to God for my intentions
Lord, uh, lights and cameras, uh
I came so hard, I pay the price for cameras, uh
I flew my newest for a night Atlantis
And told my oldest bitch her flight was cancelled, one night examples

[Interlude]
Fuck this nigga
If I ever see him, yeah
I'ma seduce him
And right when he leasts expects it
Take his wallet and dip

[Verse 2]
It's the village, you can go and call the police
Ridin' dirty in the car with no lease
Skinny nigga but my pockets obese
Same nigga used to rob Sobey's
And lately I need me a bill again
I need to get back to the old and original, I need to get real again
Or back in Toronto where niggas'll kill you for who you be chillin' wit'
And work from the shootas, the shorty you screwin'
You not really wit' the shits, we don't really feel this shit
When Grandma kicked me out the crib, I was only a baby
Said fuck it, I hustled and went and bought me a Mercedes
I whipped it, I whipped it when I would see her in the hallway
And when she didn't see me, I parked that bitch right in the driveway
It's priceless

[Verse 3]
I used to take the 401 to TO
Honda Civic rollin' dimes and scopin' PO (Bro, we did that)
Taxin' season, tryna find a link on T4s
To talk to Argie, you gon' need a check with 3 O's, lord
Life commitments, I need a shawty every night to witness
Jamaican models bring ya ice and Guinness
And workin' pussy, that's my type of fitness
I'm talkin' money like I'm Donald Trump

[Interlude]
You can't see them?
Put the money in the duffle, yeah
Yeah
That gangsta shit

[Verse 4]
Let them niggas know them yoppas on the reload
Gots to grind when your stock is worth a kilo
Smokin' Swishers, motion pictures, Tarantino
Ballin' hard, it's Argie Fargo, fuckin' veno
Hey, hey fuck it, we comin' for all of 'em
I'm all in the Parliament
Don't pay for no oregano
We're smokin' on flawless
It's dope in my closet
I got the scope on deposits
I be so fresh and so clean
Bitch, you see soap in my toilets
My teacher Miss Thomas told me I would never be nothin'
I looked her ass dead in the face and said I'm gon' be somethin'
She told me that in a few years I'd be catchin' the bussing
Now I'm catchin' the car service, guess who the driver? Her husband
It's priceless

[Verse 1]
Oh, Banana Co
We really love you, and we need you
And oh, Banana Co
We'd really love to believe you

[Chorus]
But everything's underground
We gotta dig it up somehow
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Oh, she said "No go"
She said she'd like to, she's seen you
And oh, Banana Co
She knows if you die then we all do

[Chorus]
And everything's underground
We've gotta dig it up somehow
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Everything's burning down
We gotta put it out somehow
Yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Now it's the B to the izzo
You know what it is I'mma stunt on the d-low
Watch me get it in, spin in the seat, black as can be
Rolling it up, giving a fuck, like I'm a slut
"Bino that's my baby what he doin out at the club?"
Fuck about your dress code, my dress code is I got a big bank roll
I think so, time to give these niggas something else
Island in the summer best believe that shit ain't common wealth
Smile on her face best believe she wearing nothing else
Watch the sun set that's a feeling that she never felt
We were born free, that's my God given
How a god living? Fantastic, fans spazz when they see  ya man passing
I'm in the Aston Martin, unforgivable blackness beg your pardon
On my Jack Johnson nigga, all my shows sell tix like Boston nigga
Put this on at the cook out, let me see you shmoney
Old school on the XM got your Auntie singing "Hola Hola Ayy"
Hit the dream too hard, I'm the new young god
This the new mixtape, but it's still the same game
How you gon be the don, when Don half my name?
How you gon be the G.O.A.T, when we are not the same?
I be feeling all this money but motherfuck the fame
It's the young Bino, I'm in your bae like Oakland
In my bed out of breath I never been this open
If you niggas can't hear me it's the weed I'm smoking
When I opened up the door I had the manager coughing like
"The hotels charging you a maintenance fee"
Gave that nigga 2 stacks and said I'm here all week
Let me roll OG, let me talk my shit
How you hotter than me? You ain't got no hits
You just got a hot feature
Bare sole on the track so my feet hurt
Do some research, know my origin
I'm the new black, fuck oranges
Yeah, that's that nigga that yall love to hate
Redbone like golden gate
Childish y'all know the name, getting hate from Charlemagnes
Last year things done changed, I was thinking bout killing y'all
I was working all night long, white bitches like King Kong
Getting money my theme song, do whatever I want
Fuck your clique do what I want, fuck your bitch do what I want
Here's some shit you niggas didn't know
Probably wrote your nigga verse
Probably wrote your nigga video
High as fuck on Arsenio
Chosen, now they show me my respect nigga
Frozen, Disney movie round his neck nigga
I told ya, I'm the best right now
From Atlanta where them niggas in your chest like "blow"
Royalty equal sign black philosophers
Became a top 5 cause nobody else was stopping us
They want me Hopsin but I'm popping and getting confident
God forbid we give him props for the job he did
Man his knob need some slobbering
I mean, fuck, do you want more?
I'm killing these niggas and still on tour
Fuck is y'all for?

[Outro]
This is for all of y'all
One day everyone's falling off
So right now we should all ball out
Life's too short to not all out
This is for all of y'all
One day everyone's falling off
So right now we should all ball out
Life's too short to not all out
I don't know what I really need
But I'd rather be smoking weed
I don't know what I really need, yeah
But I'd rather be smoking weed

[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]

If they only owned love, shown love, grown love, like this before
If they only knew love, true love, to love, like this before
If they only gave love, saved love, brave love, like this before
If they only called love, love love, called love, like this before
If they'd only showed love, they owed love, owed love, like this before
If they only showed love, they owed love, owed love, like this before
If they only knew love, true love, to love, like this before
If they only gave love, saved love, brave love, like this before
If they only showed love, they owed love, they owed love, like this before

La la la la la, la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la la...

Like this before
If they ever showed love, they owed love, they owed love, they owed love
If they ever showed love, they owed love, they owed love, like this before

Oh, oh, oh, oh... yeah
La la la la la, la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la la...

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill]
If they only claimed love, claimed love, claimed love
They maintained love
Instead they drained love, stained love
They didn't control love, my soul loves a whole love, like this before
Received the same love
If they didn't regret love, forget love, say they never met love
If they will love, don't kill love, just be still love
If they will love, don't kill love, just be still love
If they will love, don't kill love, just be still love
If they will love, don't kill love, just be still love

[Intro]
Gambino: Yeah, where'd you guys go?

Girls: To where, In Atlanta?

Strip Club Queen: When I used to live here, I was the strip club queen

Fam: Wait, wait, so what's up with Follies? Like lemme know

Strip Club Queen: Follies is my favorite strip club ever, in Atlanta

Gambino: Follies is the realest

Strip Club Queen: I swear to god-Follies is the realest, more-so because they have international bitches in there, you got bitches from Cambodia, you got bitches from fucking Italy, you got bitches from fucking Africa, you got bitches from...Kansas, you got bitches from everywhere in Follies

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Situations will arise, in our lives
But you gotta be smart about it
Celebrations, with the guys
I sacrificed, 'cause you could not sleep without it
Girl I, 'cause I loved you
You were my girl
See I, thought the world of you
But so you know
You don't have to call baby no
'Cause I'mma be alright tonight
You don't have to call baby no
I'mma be alright tonight

[Interlude: DJ Drama]
I mean
I waited, and waited, and waited
For that phone call
And then I served you what she was asking for
Nah, you ain't gotta make that call now
Stone Mountain, yeah, you started running that thing after us

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
(Don't you ever go away)
We are very rare
(Please don't leave me girl)
10% of a foster home trying to Cinderella this shit
This melanin pit they placed us in and said get out
(I always knew baby)
No blueprint, hell's cruise ship
(You don't have to call, just text me)
Took him and her, who made him and her
Who made him and her who made her
Who ran away from the south at 14 pregnant
Who made her who came back to the south
Atlanta, Georgia who made me
Funny hairline, white name
Blonde dreads, African name , both of our parents
Original black hippies, so what?
(Deep inside, I'm deep inside your heart)
(Please don't call me girl)
Little 5 points to Avondale to Stone Crest
You out in Lithonia though
But fuck that, I'm a high class nigga
I catch you out at Lenox
Nah fuck that, I'm looking for hoes at Atlantic Station
Nah fuck that, I'm at South DeKalb Mall
Really in the parking lot, leaning on some broke niggas Camry
The pic you sent last night says you really with the shits
(You wanna go, you know where i am)
My leather passenger seat exhales
Wasn't ready for all that
'Cause it's not me
I mean who is right?
(I just wanna die, i just wanna die, inside of your love)
I'mma take you to Tongue & Groove
There's $20 to wear my hat inside
I give em $100 and tell em to pay forward for the niggas behind me
They playing Jeezy like that shit came out yesterday
Thug motivation, I was never a thug and they used to respect me for it
But now the game's fucked up and I gotta Michael Corleone these niggas
Quiet, confident, I talked to her
She came with you, but she left with me
And now she's in the passenger seat
So, where we going?
Just away (Away, away, away, away)
Which leaves you standing there thinking
You don't have to call, baby

[Produced by: Nick Banga]

[Intro: DJ Drama]
She text me today
She said she hate me
She's not the first
She probably won't be the last
I don't give a fuck

[Chorus]
I came here to do my own shit
I came here to do my own shit
No fucks given (fucks given)
No fucks given

[Verse 1]
What you know about me
No one else can do it like me
No one else can do it like me
I was checking I.D
She don't look 18
She don't know 18, no
I was doing my thing
You know I was tossing that green
We ain't even on the same team
We ain't even hit her with the real shit
I'ma show these motherfuckers, you ain't really seen bread
Aw, I'ma do it for the real niggas
When them boys ain't feeling ya
Real only see a real nigga
Heard of Bino? Man, that boy amazing
You don't hear me 'cause a nigga blazing, blazing
Oh, you don't want a problem
You don't want yo man to solve 'em, naw

[Chorus]
I came here to do my own shit
I came here to do my own shit
No fucks given (fucks given)
No fucks given

[Verse 2]
I'm killin' these niggas off a mixtape
And most these niggas out been fake
Me and my niggas all homeless
We ain't hear shit that y'all told us
We was getting money, you ain't getting money
All we did was study, all we did was study
We don't give a fuck about status
Girls and you know I got baddest
Just cut her off, she the saddest
Wish a nigga would like Aladdin
No chill, dress code I'm like "oh well"
She ain't seen my hotel
Man them numbers don't bode well
War is hell
This ain't war but I'm beefin' nigga, my ether nigga, wooh
I don't fuck with the fake shit
More green than a spaceship
We don't fuck with y'all, no way
Y'all ain't got no taste
Rappers lie boldface
Now we in the mix
If you broke we can fix it
Sayin' I ain't doing things, look at this shit
Look at this shit, look at this shit

[Chorus]
I came here to do my own shit
I came here to do my own shit
No fucks given (fucks given)
No fucks given, uh

Bags in this bitch, so many bags, like, "Where the racks go?" (Woo)

Givenchy my toes and my bros and my hoes (Rich girl)

Don't act like you don't know when you know that you know
For real (Givenchy)
Even when I'm laying down, baby, I'm keepin' it tucked

Swear to God, when you play with just one of these bucks
You get killed

Baby girl, what you know, what you know 'bout that?
What you know 'bout that? What you know 'bout tha—

[Part 1: Dream]

I had a dream I ran Atlanta
And I was on every radio station
And 107.9 was 97.5 again
And they played me at Golden Glide on Friday
And they played me real loud on the street
We drive up Memorial Drive, up Wesley Chapel
I reopen 112, and Jazzy T's
I'd bring back Turner Field. I fire all the cops in Cobb county
Chick-Fil-A will be open on Sundays
I bring back LaFace Records, Freaknik, Kilo Ali, Lou
I get J.R. Crickets some Spelman girls with big booties
I reopen SciTrek, strippers will get Mother's Day off
And I'd have my own Gangsta Grillz mixtape

[Part 2: Southern Hospitality]

Hey, this is Steve Smith from American Dad
And this is Royalty

I ain't no snitch, cops, I don't trust 'em
I ain't no bitch, all I do is run 'em
I ain't—I ain't no snitch, cops, I don't trust 'em
I ain't no bitch, all I do is run 'em
Nigga, I was stuntin', keep that shit a hundred
If it ain't about the money, then it's not up for discussion
If it ain't about—

[Interlude: DJ Drama, Childish Gambino]
After selling out the Georgia Dome 3 nights in a row
After selling 10 million copies of his newest album
Roscoe's Wetsuit in one week!
After successfully petitioning to recarve his own face into Stone Mountain (yeah, yeah) (Stone Mountain)
He's still givin' you niggas a free mixtape?
Why, Gambino? Why young guy? Why so generous?

[Verse 2]
I ain't no snitch, cops I don't trust 'em
I ain't no bitch, all I do is run 'em (It's Royalty!)
Nigga, I was stuntin', keep that shit a hunnid
If it ain't about the money then it's not up for discussion
If it ain't about progress, ain't about success
Why this nigga suspect? You ain't seen sus' yet
I'ma fuck the game so hard like Tiffney
Niggas taking shots, I'm like "Nigga, don't tempt me"
I seen what you make, yeah, them shows sold out
But you doing clubs and I'm doing like all out things
"Why the hell he rapping if he all out sings?"
Royalty the movement, we all out kings
For real, Bino on a mission
We are not friends, nigga, this is business
Girl, this my dream, ain't no split decisions
Watch me cut this bitch off, I'ma need some scissors
Mama in the kitchen, hot sauce on them chitlins
I was always spittin', just that no one else was listening
Got your girl and now we kissing, she attracted to my vision
Now she see what she was missin', now she act a little different
Telling you she need some distance
Yeah, come on over, we can talk about it
Now this nigga mad, yeah, he thought about it
But he don't really want it, semen on her stomach
That's a second coming; Jesus
Flow so genius, can't low-key this
Puffin' on a swisher like a ho smoke penis
They want me Uncle Remus, but I'm just flexin' on 'em

[Part 3: Partna Dem]

[Intro]
This on some old Atlanta shit. But I like it cause, it's not about what you know, but who you know. Know what I'm saying?

[Verse]
Royalty my partna dem, no one else my partna dem
Stay strapped with that arsenal
These niggas winnin', it's hard to tell

Slide up in them DMs, her nigga didn't even notice, I'm focused
Yeah, I'm the man of the hour
Play me on Power, play me on Hot
Nigga I'm hot, nigga don't stop
Flow so cold put a cherry on top
Haters so mad, he ain't even know why, probably all the autonomy
Fuck all your feelings, I'm proud of me
Head was so good it's psychology
God damn, I'm just being who I am
From that weird ass little kid to this ballin' ass grown man
Man this beat is going so HAM, flow been burr since Novem'
Chain been burr since Novem'
That means cold, I'm just sayin', we ain't playin'
If your man don't want to lick it, I volunteer as tribute

See them titties, wanna motorboat it
I'm Dopaliscious like SpottieOttie

Off em' no reason, I kill em on spot at Four Seasons
Ice skating like Lupe Fiasco

Riding with the karats and the bad bitches

[Hook]
Money baby, money baby, money baby

Fly girl, she named Beatle
Clothes off, she don't need 'em
Animals, she don't eat 'em
Hungry for it, I feed her, uh, I feed her
You already know that I feed her
I don't mess with them fuck boys, she said I don't either
She said I'm gone eat her, attitude so diva
Got a big place like Scarface, treat her ass like Elvira
Skin tone godiva, smokin' on that cheeba
Girl you got me so hypnotized that thang be givin' me fever
Let me get it
Take her to Kauai, fucked on the beach
Fucked on the floor, we ain't gotta speak
Beach, getting high like a motherfuck
Royalty the team so you know what's up
Kitty so good, let me beat it up, kitty so good I could sleep in it
Hollow tip flow sending shots to my enemies
Niggas who tried to Nick Cannon me
Thoughts were so bad that I pleaded insanity
Bottles, I pop me a case
Live on the radio bought me a place
This is my summer of love
Yea, all these bitches is down
But never put nothin' above

[Hook]
Money baby, money baby, money baby
Money baby, money baby, money baby
Money baby, money baby, money baby
Money baby, money baby, money baby

[Verse 2]
Kick it like Kazuya
This game is how we maneuver
There's plenty fish in the sea and I treat them groupies like grouper
My life inside a computer, back up my soul to the cloud
Funny we show 'em class and they call me the class clown
Money is in my jeans, best believe that it's passed down
Got the room thumpin, she tell me don't stop
I mean really don't stop
I must be doing something
Something really on point, something really on point
Now she look back at it
But she give me that look when I gotta dip out
Stop being Dramatic (DRAMATIC!)
Can't nobody do it like this
Forgot her name as soon as I hit
Got that buzz, the phone was silent
Run the game, that's us
Fort Knox, gold bars
Let her get it on both sides, I did it all, with no cosign
And I'm ballin' like I give a fuck
Now they know wassup
Smokin' like she wanna fuck
We are not in love, she's a grown up
And I'm so childish
Still that's my bitch
We waste our time with all this

[Hook]
Money baby, money baby, money baby
Money baby, money baby, money baby
Money baby, money baby, money baby
Money baby, money baby, money baby

As time goes on (Hello?, hello?)
Your talk keeps getting smaller (Hello?, hello?)
As Childish lives in his short shorts,
He's got no time for your short money!

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Two gold chains and I still don't never wear 'em
Why would I wear 'em? Cheese like a camera
Spendin' money son a bitch nigga like Sanford
I'm lookin' in the mirror, I'm like 'Damn, I'm so handsome'
If it ain't 'bout that money, why a young god answer?
Ghost on my wrist (wrist), got me so Casper
Flow so cold, watch them haters get asthma
And every time we fuckin', man she think that's the last one

[Hook: Kari Faux]
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk

Three cellphones and I still don't ever call 'em
Why would I call 'em?  Bitch you know I'm ballin'
Spendin' money, make it bounce back like Spalding (Swish)
Got a new nigga and he say he from New Orleans
And he ain't talkin' money nigga, why the fuck you talkin'
All my bitches bossy, all my diamonds flossy
Rap game sriracha man you know I'm saucy

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
Young Bino, we be mobbin'
You don't see me, I'm on an island
These haters left us no choice
Leave the trap like so moist
Little rock like dope boys
Oh my God, I'm out of fucks
Colombian but she ain't a plug
That's racist
In '96 I had K-swiss
You 96 with some fake bitch
And I 69'd with a bunch of dimes and that money talk my language
Head game so Cambridge
God damn, you dirty...
You were lettin' me bust in it
But if they ask I plead the fifth

[Bridge: Kari Faux]
Ok this the part where I need ya'll to make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Got a new nigga and he say he from New Orleans

[Hook: Kari Faux]
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk

Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk

[Intro]
Show me how to keep it goin'

Hey, hey, hey, yeah, I'ma keep it goin'
As long as you show me, I'ma keep it goin'

[Verse 1]
Uh
Showing love to these bitches
As I take off like a missile, ayy
These niggas mugging when they see us
So I clutch on all my pistols
Plus I come through smoking loud like a whistle
Looking down from the cloud in my rearview
These pussy niggas want a slice like Kimbo
And I freeze them all, Sub Zero
Dynasty, Dynasty
These bitches climb on me, climb on me
That's mine, I want the whole ninety Gs
All my niggas feasting, yes, dining please
I put on my ice and they liking this
Fuck her fast, nitrogen, nitrogen
Roar, bitch, Lion King, Lion King
I got more water than Tennessee
Then I take it off and pour it on her like a coach
Playing with my money bitch you fired, you a roach
Straight up in that vintage, it's just Chanel, no Coach
Put the little bitch in time out, no spoke
Why the fuck a nigga rolling my weed and leave it open?
And I'm cooking all white, nigga, no portions

[Chorus]
I cannot be worried 'bout no bitch
'Cause I know a bitch could be somewhere sucking a dick, ayy
You like "Where the hell is yo bitch?"
Meanwhile yo bitch like "Where the hell is yo clique?", hey
I can't buy you pearls, buy your shit
I got three boys, and three girls, with a bitch, hey
Diamonds yellow like corn on the Cob
I can't buy you shit unless you got a blow job
Big Homie show me how to keep it goin'
I can't be no lick like no motherfucking tongue, ayy
Big Homie tell me how to keep it goin'
Milk these lil' bitches like I'm motherfucking farming
Big Homie show me how to keep it goin'
I can't be no lick like no motherfucking tongue, ayy
Big Homie tell me how to keep it goin'
*Sips Lean*

[Verse 2]
A nigga riding with the top off (Skrt)
And now I need a new Hairdo (Where she at?)
Bitch, you know my diamonds wetter than a sink
Every time I come around them bitches faint
Baby I'ma sing to you like Tank
Baby I want you to dry me like I'm paint
Spl-spl-spl-splat on the other side
If you bout to die nigga tell me would you ride
Let a nigga play, I pull up with a whole tribe
Flood your wrist with lots of karats 'cause you're Bonnie and Clyde, woo
Hundred rounds on that motherfucker, gah, gah, gah (WOO!)
I get respect whenever I land in New York
Like Bobby Shmurda, nigga, ah, ah (Woo)
It's a shame how I yell at these niggas and don't lose my voice
And, it's a shame how my ice so cold but I leave these bitches moist (Leave her wet, what?)
I swear to God, baby, you're the people's choice
And when I get home right before I go to sleep I wake up my little boy, hey
And I tell him

[Chorus]
I cannot be worried 'bout no bitch
'Cause I know a bitch could be somewhere sucking a dick, ayy
You like "Where the hell is yo bitch?"
Meanwhile yo bitch like "Where the hell is yo clique?", hey
I can't buy you pearls, buy your shit
I got three boys, and three girls, with a bitch, hey
Diamonds yellow like corn on the Cob
I can't buy you shit unless you got a blow job
Big Homie show me how to keep it goin'
I can't be no lick like no motherfucking tongue, ayy
Big Homie tell me how to keep it goin'
Milk these lil' bitches like I'm motherfucking farming
Big Homie show me how to keep it goin'
I can't be no lick like no motherfucking tongue, ayy
Big Homie tell me how to keep it goin'

[Outro]
Show me how to keep it goin'
Tell me how to keep it goin'
Long as you show me how to keep it goin'
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma keep it goin'
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, I'ma keep it goin'
As long as you show me, I'ma keep it goin'
Tell me how to keep it goin'
Long as you show me how to keep it goin'
Tell me how to keep it goin'
Long as you show me how to keep it goin'
As long as you show me, I'ma keep it goin'

[Intro: DJ Drama (Childish Gambino)]
Is it too much to ask for lyrics?
(Alright, alright)
(Royalty has never done a track together)
I mean it's 2014 man, c'mon really
(Well I thought we would get everybody on the same track)
You niggas could learn a lot by now
Watch this
(I'll go first)
Stone Mountain

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Give a fuck about these haters man
I'm the flyest that there's ever been
I'm always reppin' Stone Mountain
You know my show is sold out
You know my smoke is so loud
And still about his business
Stay up out my business, flow so vicious
When niggas talkin' shit, shut they mouth, that's what this is
I walk up in the party, we took all the bitches
They love how I move, we might need a minute
God damn, Summer looking like son of Sam, I'm killin' niggas
Hang with models and a couple strippers
She love my music so I nutted in her
Damn I'm decent, Liam Neeson
I'm takin' over, you playing sober
Gassed up and you finished last
I'm crying nigga, that's tear gas
Woooh, now I'm flexing
Was that fire? Bitch you guessed it (Oh shit!)

[Hook: Steve G Lover]
I bet you I can make that ass hot
C'mon bae, drop it like a ass shot
Say my sixteen will make that ass hot
Song done, drop it like a ass shot
Boy stuntin' got they ass hot
Go on nigga, drop 'em like a ass shot
Jump on this beat and get they ass hot
Go on girl, drop it like a ass shot

[Verse 2: Steve]
I am, the prince, two cups, always
Our team, got money, we stunt hard, so don't hate
Fall off, no way, we run it, it's too late
We smoke sour, call that flowers
I just blew, a bouquet
My girl, so sweet, like Crème brûlée
But still, she that hood, like red Kool-Aid
We on top, toupée, I got hits, like touché
I just did Rome in one day
I just flew out to Croat-ia
I'm independent man and still doin' major
Young King so flashy got me lookin' like lazers
Atlanta housewife I can make ya like Phaedra
So let's play my, I'mma play ya
Get bands, then head to la playa
My niggas is bias
My brothers the owner, fuck with 'em get higher
G-lover spit fire, that flame is saliva
We're riders that got Nick Cannon's now
Make 'em drop you like Mariah, wassup?

[Hook: Steve G Lover]
I bet you I can make that ass hot
C'mon bae, drop it like a ass shot
Say my sixteen will make that ass hot
Song done, drop it like a ass shot
Boy stuntin' got they ass hot
Go on nigga, drop 'em like a ass shot
Jump on this beat and get they ass hot
Go on girl, drop it like a ass shot

[Verse 3: Swank]
Start her off with gin and tonic, mine's a double
Out in Vegas fool, you know I'm bettin' double
Double your car note, double your mama rent
Ain't shit but house money, I ain't spent a cent
Mo' money mo' problems, yeah that's official
I just throw cash at it, that's my issue, it's hard
So I feed my boo boo hard that moo moo bags until she...
If she need mo', then girl I miss you, bye
But ain't no lookin' back
Cause I know it's a salt pile (you salty?)
I'm goin' Chevy with metallic fuckin' gun style
No door handle, she high  tryna figure how
While my auto mobile looks like Girls Gone Wild
That's top off, nigga drop offs
Slidin' dirty with yo' dame
OG sativa baby, watch ahead for that air plane
Fuck with my money, and I'm at your house like the mail came
You meet the Swank lion, beast mode, untamed

[Hook: Steve G Lover]
I bet you I can make that ass hot
C'mon bae, drop it like a ass shot
Say my sixteen will make that ass hot
Song done, drop it like a ass shot
Boy stuntin' got they ass hot
Go on nigga, drop 'em like a ass shot
Jump on this beat and get they ass hot
Go on girl, drop it like a ass shot

[Verse 4: Fam]
Big homie have you seen her
She got the Dobrev, all white Nina
Packed like Serena, or maybe Trina
Shit I don't know, they both got ass
So of course he came to give you all these courses
And you can't ignore 'em, cause these hoes adore 'em
Words hot, don't slur 'em
I just speak up, so please ho, keep up
Please ho, keep up
Ok, ok, ok, she ain't getting money, no way
I met her on a Monday, but I fucked her back to Sunday
I told her she my Brandy, I'm her one and only Wanya
Till she drove off the driveway in her '97 Hyundai, bitch

[Intro]
Uh, uh
Here we go, boom, boom
Yeah, uh, uh
Oh, no-no-no
Yeah, okay

[Chorus]
We can go together, it doesn't really matter
We can get there, we can do it if we try
You know that I love you, put no one else above you
We can get there, we can do it if we try

[Verse 1]
Young Bino in the house like a B&E
Why I'm looking so fly, I'm just being me
Moved up, weed in my girl clutch
White girls, so the twelve never really searched
Smoke cars, swear to god she need a bigger purse
Royalty, I'm the boss, we ain't gotta work
Lay it out on the island
She Hawaiian, wonder if she let me slide in?
The OG making noise like a firetruck
Flew in, touched down, then we light 'em up
I've been saying that the clique, there's a lot of us
They talk shit, but nobody else on top of us
Got popular, this the real shit
Get—in the face with a full clip
Get—in the aim, niggas don't slip
Then get—with a case just for sellin' it
I know them gorillas, I hang with them killers
They paint 'em as villains when really they livin', we gotta ball
This is World War Three, I'm the new Jay-Z
I ain't write shit down, I'ma steal that crown
I'ma do that thing, girl, you sweeter than mango
How we cool and confident with hair like Django?
How we walk in the room and the girls they notice?
'Cause they know you bogus, I'm the man you noticed, and

[Chorus]
We can go together, it doesn't really matter
We can get there, we can do it if we try
You know that I love you, put no one else above you
We can get there, we can do it if we try

[Verse 2]
I'ma show you how to do this
It's easy when you let go, let go
Didn't mean to make you nervous
The booty lookin' retro, retro
You can be the moon to me
And I can be your spotlight (Spotlight)
And if you think I'm ballin'
You shoulda seen me last night, last night
Fuck that, fuck ya'll and the po-po's
Down under, surfin' on the Gold Coast
I'm looking for the truth in a blunt
And I ain't got a home, let's stunt
So, baby, if you feel like you wanna leave
I ain't afraid to drop a couple SkyMiles
The game ain't easy
We both deserve a little bit of timeout

[Outro]
We can go together, it doesn't really matter
(Cough)
Oh
Yeah
'Kay, one, two, three, go!
Oh, hey
Oh, hey, ah
One more time

[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
One time I was at the beach
And we were looking at the stars
And this girl was laying next to me
And the blanket that we had was,  had stars on it as well
So it looked liked we were just floating in an abyss
Honestly, when I see her face I just smile I guess
I mean, our cars came and the lights were on on them so we could see what the waves look like
I'll be waiting here on the sand
I remember that first night
You were wearing a power ranger black T-shirt
So was I, a different color, so was Moey and his brother
Not as pure, so insecure
The times have changed
But really we just looked up at the stars
For a couple hours, turned off all the lights on the cars
The world was ours it was yours—it was mine
The time flew by like it was prime time and I'm inside of
Life, you shouldn't be my wife you should just be with me
On this beautiful night
Maybe we can make things right
Maybe we can do it without any spite
It's just for tonight, and we hope it doesn't end
So we drive back to our homes chilling with our friends

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Balling like Jabari Parker, they say I look like him
If we met bet it would be awkward break out the Sudafed
Cause the flow cold, like a SoCo
I was smoking-smoking John Lennon—where my Yoko?
This that call yo grandma you ain't ready yet
Verbal mania, imma show you the illest, get my cousin to kill it
Had a flow but you steal it, I'm in the mood so we ball out
Got the top down in the back we could fall out
We could fall out, nigga we could fall out
Your girlfriend push a Prius, she giving me that genius
Mensa, we that Tony Danza
Wine on the rug man you know that shit expensive
I'm on that Willy Wonka, green so Blanka
Vape so good and the pot like lobster
Nigga, I'm a monster, fuck it, I'm a mon-star
Man, I got this beat I'm going ham like a cop car
That's unless you see me pulling up on the boulevard
Turn them flashing lights, at least you know who you really are
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god

[Bridge: Childish Gambino]
I guess this ending's the best for me
But I can't leave you behind
You know that I never wanted to see what's on your mind

[Outro: Fam]
Goddamn, Goddamn, Goddamn
Yo it's kinda hard not to like, get fucking cheesy on this shit
But, does that even matter?
You know what I'm saying, juxtaposition man
Juxta-fucking-position
My nigga Jaden Smith dropping  jewels and niggas don't believe him cause he's Jaden Smith
But it's all about packaging right?
Real shit though, good and bad is all relative man
It really is, a lot of niggas is sheep
We don't even know what we like anymore
We just know what the most hype is
Shit, do you really like that shit you like?
Or you like the way they gave it to you?
You know what I'm saying?
Pepsi, Coca-Cola same thing
Dave Chapelle said that, the one that taste the best
Was the one that was paying him the most at the time
That's all that happens with us man
We some weak niggas man, all of us
Followers, sheeps, plural made that shit up
Apologin' ain't no real word my nigga
We know this, but he knows more cause he broke the rules that don't even fucking exist man
Funny thing is man is like, as a futurist
And I can call myself a futurist
Nobody is even going to give a fuck until I'm gone
So does it even matter?
Yes it does...

[Intro]
Yeah
Oh no, no, yeah

[Verse 1]
I know the secret we share
Look what this feeling has done to me
There's something deep in the air
Just hope your hands lift me comfortably, oh

[Bridge 1]
I don't know why but every time I see you smiling
I'm tired of running, tired of playing, tired of hiding
If we could be together would that make you happy?
And if it wouldn't, tell your girlfriend to get at me
(I'm just playing tho)

[Hook]
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen

[Verse 2]
I think there's something for us
Lying around as the world comes down
If you understand what I'm saying
You won't end up in the lost and found, nope

[Bridge 2]
I don't know why but every time I see you dancing
(I see you dancing)
I'm tired of running tired of playing late romancing
(I don't want to)
If we could be together would that make you happy?
(I don't fuck with that)
And if it wouldn't, tell your girlfriend to get at me

[Hook]
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen

[Verse 3]
Now why can't every day be like this
Smoke a  J at the beach like this
Hang with bae at the beach like this
Conversations with Kish like this (hey!)
Never thought it could be like this
Be the man like I am like this
Dance around shake your hips like this
Mess around make a hit like this

[Outro]
Like this, like this, no
Always be like this, no
Like this, like this, like this, no
Always be like this, no
Like this, always be like this
Like this, like this, like this

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Now that we have found this love, baby
I can't explain my feel, oh
Now that we have found this love, baby
I've never felt this real, oh
Loving you is all I know, baby
You make me feel so high, oh no
I just wanna feel your love, baby
You know I'm down to ride, oh no no

[Pre-Chorus: Childish Gambino]
When your song is on and your hand's in mine
And I'm holding you tight, make it feel good
Let me hold it down, I'm so glad we found
It's whenever you like, make it feel good

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Make it feel good, make it feel good, alright
Make it feel good, make it feel good
Make it feel good, make it feel good, alright
Make it feel good, make it feel good

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Now that we have found this love, baby
These haters can't say shit, oh
I know sometimes it's hard when I'm so far
I know you miss this di-love
Let's go somewhere far away, baby
Where we don't need no phone, oh
Cause now that we have found this love, baby
You'll never be alone, oh oh

[Pre-Chorus: Childish Gambino]
When your song is on and your hand's in mine
And I'm holding you tight, make it feel good
Let me hold it down, I'm so glad we found
It's whenever you like, make it feel good

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Make it feel good, make it feel good, alright
Make it feel good, make it feel good
Make it feel good, make it feel good, alright
Make it feel good, make it feel good

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
All my friends are telling me, oh
You need to slow it down, yeah
But I'm so tired of wasting all this time
I need your love right now
Give it to me like oh, ooh yeah
All that I want now, yeah
Give it to me like oh
Oh, yeah
Oh, give it to me like

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Make you feel good, make you feel good, alright
Make you feel good, make you feel good
Make you feel good, make you feel good, alright
Make you feel good, make you feel good

[Outro: Childish Gambino & Jaden Smith]
I used to walk on the beach at night
I remember
The best time was when well, me and you
We got all our friends and we got a tent
We slept in it
Not the whole night, but just enough time
Magic happened, nothing was born luckily
It's up to me, but
Then we left
The times have changed
The pleasures that I feel
They say you never say never, it's real
Electric eels in the water, we should probably not go deep
I like to stare at you and look at you when you sleep
I'd like to write a poem for you, leave it for you in your room Under the moon, romance
Hold on, brother

[Intro]
Yo I want to give a special shout out to DJ Drama, for letting me do this
I really appreciate it (And it's like this)
Hey go DJ! (That's my DJ!)
Hey go DJ! (That's my DJ!)
Hey go DJ! (Uhh, yeah, uhh)

[Verse]
Stuntin' 101, I'm doing shit that ya'll never done
Talking from TVs and movies, these the choppers to Uzis
Nothing can bruise me, nigga this is more than a movement
My squad is forever, we ain't getting annulments
New song on your speakers got me getting enormous
Played a performance, niggas getting paid on performance
A lot of ya'll hate cause my women is gorgeous
I mean they a work of art, something out of a portrait
I mean I'm a work of art, all my verses is poetry
Niggas is different, you chicken, we ain't fucking with poultry
Bunch of crab ass bloggers got me allergic to shellfish
If I fell off in a day, man, these niggas be helpless
I be bringing on a plane 'till you lames get mailed it
It's ROYALTY and, nigga, I'm the king like Elvis
I don't talk about it, let them niggas conversate
What's the song about it? Give her D and smoke a J
We don't play, I'm so on a bench, money is the stench
Let me vent, I'mma smoke 'em out, circles from her mouth
What's my favorite sound? "Oh my God I'm cumming"
Second favorite sound? "Oh that sound like money"
Oh that sound like freedom
Oh that sound gon' need a feature but he didn't need him
I'm coming back like Jesus, color Reeces Pieces
That's the money down here, we gon' need a Visa
Bread like he Anita
That's my DJ, thank you DJ Drama
Came in this bitch like my baby mama
I believe in karma so I run the summer
All I got is checks, check out all these commas!
Check out how I'm eating, it is very cool
James White a nigga, man I'm such a fool
I'm doing me so cold, this nigga spitting so cold
His girl 20 years old, she know she 'bout to get choose
That rabbit hole, I'm talking shit, but I'm rapping though
And that IRS and I'm taxing hoes and I saw the check
And said "add some o's, add some o's!"
Why my clique so animal? Why my clique so Set It Off?
And I'm Queen Latifah you know I'm eatin', I fucked it up
Niggas think we ain't tough enough, niggas think we was born rich
Niggas thinking a lot of shit, niggas don't know a wars coming
Niggas don't know I saw something, killing trees, Paul Bunyon
Bunyon foot, foot clan, klans man... Alamo
Stream of conscious, I don't know
Flow was done a long time ago, and I feel for niggas who save a ho
I ain't got time and I'm throwing up like gang signs
But that was not the case
You niggas wish your lifestyle was nice as my place
I'm eating off these white kids, I don't need their plate
We burning down that blue dream, she sitting on my face
I'd leave it on her backside, but that'd be a waste
That be a waste, that be a waste

[Outro]

[Verse]
Whippin' the Lam', whippin' and grippin' the Lam'
Niggas like 'Bino the man, I was  like damn
I was allergic to not makin' money, the timing was perfect
They used to not pay him no never mind
Niggas these numbers don't ever lie
Fuck wit' your boy like a pedophile
Damn I'm fly, I'm so high I might need a spaceship
I'm on acid, this bitch is basic
We them niggas y'all love to hate on
But when you see us y'all never say shit
Conversation, I'm in that, top 5, I'm in rap
Pussy niggas, y'all say shit and don't do shit
Flew your girl to Saint Lucia
Oh, these niggas are not from Atlanta
These niggas are not from Atlanta
Cause I'm from Atlanta and we would just handle it
Struggle rap, Canibus, Amethyst, my weed purple
Rap game, I'm Steve Urkel, Urquelle
She want some pics, I'm like "oh well, you better Google search"
Money rule my universe, nigga we made it
We had the beat and then we heard the verse
And said "nigga we hate it"
Livin' my life like I'm Jaden (Smith), Tesla the color of Satan (whip)
Bitches are mine for the takin', I understand why you hate us
Part II: "Nextel Chirp"

[Chorus]
Nigga don't (DRAMATIC!)
Hit me on my Nextel chirp, when you heard that brrrp brrrp, mean that nigga got some work
Yeah, my cousin used to serve 'em, now he learning how to walk
If you really from Atlanta then you heard this shit before
Yeah, you know, uh
Nigga don't hit me on my Nextel chirp
When you heard that brrrp brrrp, mean that nigga got some work
Yeah, my cousin used to serve 'em, now he learning how to walk
If you really from Atlanta then you heard this shit before
Yeah, you know, uh

[Verse]
Yes I be the man, who you tellin'?
Smokin' on that loud, what you smellin'?
Cops want a nigga for the sport
Hundred dollars, can't afford it
Made my momma cry in court, fuck them niggas
Fulton County, Cobb County, see the twelve be out
See you wit ya friends and break you up because you hangin out
Learn to talk about, what you talkin' 'bout?
Never on the phone, had to do it on my own
Took a minute, now we on, yeah
Scooter got the Street Lottery, that's a classic
Cause it be showin' niggas how to be when you passin'
That white girl, that white girl, Niykee Heaton, yeah
I might girl, I might girl, are you eatin' though?
Patience, congratulations, I'm on my A shit
I met this dude while on vacation, I didn't say shit
When he was talkin' all that bullshit about the nation
His daughter, I just gave a facial, my reparations

[Bridge]
Uh, it's a new black renaissance
Uh, all that wack shit they be on
Uh, what's the type of shit that they be on
Uh, what's the type of shit that they be on

Part III: "Let Your Hair Blow" (feat. Young Scooter)

[Intro: Young Scooter]
Let the top down and let your hair blow
Let the top down and let your hair blow
Let the top down and let your hair blow
Let the top down and let your hair blow
Let the top down and let your hair blow
Let the top down and let your hair blow
You got a perfect body, all natural
Body that the superstar lookin' for
Hey baby, let's just go for a ride, okay

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
Let the top down and let your hair blow
Let the top down and let your hair blow
You got a perfect body, all natural
Body that the superstar lookin' for
Let's ride and let the top down
Let your hair blow, ride and smoke out
We party on the Interstate, shut I-20 down
Even in the winter flexin' with the top down

[Verse: Childish Gambino]
Top down, let 'em see a king
East side, East side, I'm just bein' me
I'm just seein' Gs, I'm just makin' culture
I just say the realest shit and hope it don't insult you
On stage, yellin' crazy shit
I was high but I meant that shit
Let it out, gotta vent that shit
Play me loud, that's event music
I don't swear to God, I just swear to me
I don't think there's anything I couldn't be
All we know is trust, that's the royalty
Please don't ask a king what it's hard to be

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
Let the top down and let your hair blow
Let the top down and let your hair blow
You got a perfect body, all natural
Body that the superstar lookin' for
Let's ride and let the top down
Let your hair blow, ride and smoke out
We party on the Interstate, shut I-20 down
Even in the winter flexin' with the top down

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
I just wanna roll with a cutie one
I ain't tryna catch no feels
We can get along sometimes
We ain't gotta be sincere
You ain't gotta laugh so small
Breathing all down my back
They ain't never had what we had
They ain't never felt like that
'Cause them summer days
Never fade away
They just stay the same
In my mind, my mind
And them summer days
Never fade away
They just stay the same
In my mind, no no

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
It's those summer days
Never fade away
It just stays the same
In my mind, no no
It's those summer days
Never fade away
Never, never change
In my mind, no no

[Verse 2: Stevie G. Lover III]
Okay, Royalty is red hot
Shots from a redbone
Talking bout her skin tone her color beats headphones
Baby I'm just living right, and you can say I'm dead wrong
But can you disagree with that, Versace on me
Got gold on the V-neck I'm passing every G  check
Didn't fuck her for a month and never had a regret
It was just nice to have you chilling up in Key West
And we was just chill, I didn't really need sex
But really is we fucking yo
Never serious so I make everything a fucking joke
She be pushing buttons and she push it till that button broke
Then we smoke a blunt and all the drama it go up in smoke
See she just graduated got a new job
Took that nose ring out her nose and went and bought a new Saab
Got that boyfriend that she living with and she don't smoke no more
But, yo, it's cool, I liked her when I knew her back before like

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
It's those summer days
Never fade away
It just stays the same
In my mind, no no
It's those summer days
Never fade away
Never, never change
In my mind, no no
Excuse my absence
People been out here burnin' bridges
It seems I gotta remind you motherfuckers who I am
You know what they call me, Luda
Have some more fun with these niggas, man
Let's go

Yeah, in Atlanta, been that hot nigga
On my second term like Barack, nigga
Lyrical abuse when I'm in the booth
Treat them like the NFL, how I drop niggas
I put 'em on the exempt list
Take 'em off the track
If they ain't earned it, that's pimp shit
Multi-colored bracelets on my wrist, no friendships
Yeah, I have relations with your bitch, no kinship
Luda, back at it like a better me
I'm just try'na earn my stripes like a referee
Call a foul on the play, you's a ho-nigga
Sellin' records, you can't even sell an O, nigga
And I'm smokin' on that knockout
New school niggas missin' credits like they dropped out
And I'm just takin' pictures 'til these bitches all cropped out
And only trace left is their bodies bein' chalked out
Then it's time to bring the drops out
Woman face down, you can say I'm gettin' topped out
Def Jam, should I opt out?
Two albums left, Flavor Flav, time to clock out
Fight the power

[Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
Till 3005, hol' up

And everyone please
Have a blessed Martin Luther King day

[Verse 1]
Love the lie and lie the love
Hangin' on, with a push and shove
Possession is the motivation
That is hangin' up the God-damn nation
Looks like we always end up in a rut

[Chorus]
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?

[Verse 2]
Slaughterhouse is killin' hogs
Twisted children killin' frogs
Poor dumb rednecks rollin' logs
While tired old ladies kissin' dogs
Hate the human, love that stinking mutt

[Chorus]
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?

[Verse 3]
The President, he's got his war
Folks don't know just what it's for
Nobody gives us rhyme or reason
Have one doubt, they call it treason
We're chicken-feathers, all without one gut

[Chorus]
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?

[Verse 4]
Church on Sunday, sleep and nod
Tryin' to duck the wrath of God
Preacher's fillin' us with fright
Tryin' to tell us what he thinks is right
He really got to be some kind of nut

[Chorus]
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?

Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?

[Verse 5]
Where's that bee and where's that honey?
Where's my God and where's my money
Unreal values, crass distortion
Unwed mothers need abortion
Kind of brings to mind ol' young King Tut (He did it now)

[Outro]
Tried to make it real - compared to what?!

[Verse 1]
Eeeh
I can't write left-handed
Would you please write a letter, to my mother
Tell her to tell, tell her to tell, tell her to tell the family lawyer
I'm trying to get a deferment for my younger brother

[Verse 2]
And tell the Reverend Harris to pray for me, Lord, Lord, Lord
Said I ain't gonna live, I'm going to live to get much older
Strange little man over here in Vietnam I ain't, I ain't never seen
Bless his heart I ain't never done nothing to
He done shot me in my shoulder, in my shoulder

[Verse 3]
Boot camp we had classes, yeah
Mhh hmmhmm, yeah
You know we talked about fighting, fighting everyday
And looking through rosy, rosy colored glasses
I must admit it seemed exciting anyway
Something they,  something they overlooked to tell me, oooh yeah
That bullets look better, I must say
Brother, brother when they're not coming at you
But going out the other way

[Verse 4](backup)
So please, please, call up the Reverend Harris  (call up the Reverend Harris)
Tell him to ask the Lord to do some good things for me
Tell him I ain't gonna live, I ain't gonna live, I ain't gonna live
To get much older, yeeeeeah yeah
Strange little man over here in Vietnam, I ain't, I ain't  never seen
Bless his heart I ain't never done nothing to
He done shot me in my shoulder, done shot me in my shoulder
Shot me in my shoulder, in my shoulder

[Verse]
I was screaming into the canyon
At the moment of my death
The echo I created
Outlasted my last breath

My voice it made an avalanche
And buried a man I never knew
And when he died his widowed bride
Met your daddy and they made you

[Hook]
I have only one thing to do and that's
Be the wave that I am and then
Sink back into the ocean
I have only one thing to do and that's
Be the wave that I am and then
Sink back into the ocean
I have only one thing to do and that's
Be the wave that I am and then
Sink back into the ocean

[Outro]
Sink back into the o-
Sink back into the ocean
Sink back into the o-
Sink back into the ocean
Sink back into the ocean

[Verse 1]
Under the tree where the grass don't grow
We made a promise to never get old
You had a chance and you took it on me
And I made a promise that I couldn't keep

[Pre-Chorus]
Heartache, heartbreaks all over town
But something flipped like a switch when you came around
And I'm in pieces, pick me up and put me together
(Oh whoa oh)

[Chorus 1]
These are the days we've been waiting for
On days like these who could ask for more
Keep them coming 'cause we're not done yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget
These are the days we've been waiting for
Rattle the cage and slam that door
And the world is calling us but not just yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget

[Verse 2]
Out on the midnight the wild ones howl
The last of the lost boys have thrown in the towel
We used to believe we were stars aligned
You made a wish and I fell out of

[Pre-Chorus]
Time flew, cut through all over town
You made me bleed when I look up and you're not around
But I'm in pieces, pick me up and put me together
(Oh whoa oh)

[Chorus 2]
These are the days we've been waiting for
Neither of us knows what's in store
You just roll your window down and place your bets
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we'll never forget
And these are the days (these are the days)
And these are the days (these are the days)

[Chorus: Dej Loaf]
Let a nigga try me, try me
I’ma get his whole motherfuckin’ family
And I ain’t playin’ with nobody
Fuck around and I’ma catch a body
Let a nigga try me, try me
I’ma get his whole motherfuckin’ family
And I ain’t playin’ with nobody
Fuck around and I’ma catch a body

[Verse 1: Dej Loaf]
Bitch I got the Mac or the 40
Turn a bitch to some macaroni
Tell me how you want it I’m on it
I really mean it I’m just not recording
Still a blow the choppa, for all you actors
Leave a bitch nigga head in pasta
You are an impostor, ain’t got no money
Put the burner to his tummy, and make it bubbly
I really hate niggas I’m a Nazi
Love wearin’ all black, you should see my closet
Rock that all white, when I’m feelin’ Godly
Pop out like Coke, I ain’t gotta park it
Fuck is y’all saying, bitch my hood love me
48214 real niggas know me
I been out my mind since they killed my cousin
Free my cousin Devin, man he just called me
All these niggas love me, can’t get ‘em off me
Fuck around gave him my number, he won’t stop calling
IBGM, we the clique bitch you see us scoring
V.I.P in the club, while your section boring
Got a bitch that Set it Off like Jada Pinkett, Queen Latifah
You rollin’ around with your nieces bitch you TeeTee
Mind full money, got a heart full of demons
Mobbin’ like Italians, we really take yo fingers
Turn yo face into a pizza, no acne
Have you singin’ like Alicia, fuck with my family
They be like you little, but got damn she spazzing
Do the whole crew, my bitches freak nasty

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I got multiple chains, a gang of old school
That I swear I don’t drive ‘less it don’t rain
Show you how to get the million, both lanes
When I switch, we gon’ blow the whole thing
That's a zip, bitch keep talking about
"Whats my favorite strain?
What’s my favorite part of the game?
The grind, or the fame?"
I told her as long as my nigga straight
We plotted this for less, now is number one albums
Niggas wasn’t sure, speculations about the outcome
Now what? More award shows, more oz's
More niggas tryna find out where I shop, when I get my clothes
Get a buzz and I put you on a roll, got a hundred rolled
Hear my car coming from the lobby
Taylor Gang over anybody

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Dej Loaf]
Bitch I got the Tommy no Hilfiger
Lil Dej ain’t about it, bitch how you figure
I don’t do no drugs, I be off liquor
So lifted, flyer than your girl, baby gone and take my picture
See I gotta get this money, my palms itchin’
Niggas gossip like hoes, most of ‘em bitches
I don’t wanna do no songs, I don’t wanna kick it
And I ain’t signing to no label, bitch I’m independent

[Chorus]

What a wonderful day to be dead.
Six feet above me, the world's gone rotten
while I'm rottin' in a coffin instead.

You'll die one day and that day could be
any one of thousands ahead,
but I can guarantee that that day will be
a wonderful day to be dead.

[Verse 2]
I ain't never lookin' for no handouts
Broke ass niggas never helpin' with they hands out
Find out where the fuck nigga live then we camp out
Screamin' fuck the world, never catch me with my pants down
Always been a stand-up guy, I'd rather stand out
Raf Simons, Stan Smith edition with my bands out
I'm the trillest one to do it since Pimp, nigga hands down
If a nigga put his hands on me, that's a man down
Trick, what? Pimps up, hoes down, whoa now
Slow down, see they runnin' with my old style
Grow foul, gold smile, you ho now, thuggin' with my old style
It's a shame how they low down
Dirty like Adidas on my sneaker feature, uh
Trappin' through the speaker, peep the beeper ringer, uh
Turnin' off phones, just to reach 'em, gotta beep 'em
I'm a Lord motherfucker, better greet him if you see him

[Chorus]
Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye
Dirty fuck niggas, how you been?
You been crossin' our minds
Niggas talk down every now and then
On the side, who gave 'em style nine times out of ten?
It was Flacko, Jodye, Flacko, Jodye
Flacko, Jodye, Flacko, Jodye

[Intro: Young Thug]

Dreams come to reality, don't you wake me for nothin' (Right now)
I'm livin' out my dream, everyday countin' money (Count up)
Rental car traffic traffickin', movin' strong packages (Strong)
I stay strapped so the kid move rapidly (Ooh)
Ain't shit sweet, let the iron fill his cavity (Brrt)
Goons on go, and they kill for the passionate (Brrat)
Bitch I got a money high, I think I lost gravity (I ain't comin' down)
And it ain't shit you can tell me (Nah)

[Verse 1]:
Ride away from Holloway
I said "Mum, this isn't a holiday
Listen up, I ain't coming back
Till I can fill the shack up with all gold plaques."
Soon come, home run, whack!
Knock it out the park with a baseball bat

[Pre-Chorus]:
When I'm driving on the wrong side of the road
I feel like JFK you know

[Chorus]:

Living the dream like a London Queen (oi!)

[Post-Chorus]

[Intro]
It's a dirty rotten shame...

[Verse 1: Travis]
This is not novelty
This is nothing delicate
This the result of a Google search for something relevant
Stake claim immediately
Cause hot products cool down
At which point they'll flock to new sounds
Take fame intravenously
But when leisure turns to habit
I'll be sure to leave the scene you started stagnant
This is nothing fraudulent
This is that joy shot itchy feeling lingering behind your target audience
You got them all convinced, but we ain't buying it, buddy
Demand for lies is high, and you're supplying it
Truth is brutal; it consumes you if you let it
Type that in your little away message and set it

[Chorus: Speech]
Keep singing songs
That I could write in my sleep
It's like I'm counting sheep
Keep singing songs
Man, you're boring me with your monotony
Keep singing songs
Just following the leader with your blah, blah, blah
Keep singing songs
That I could write in my sleep
It's like I'm counting sheep

[Verse 2: Travis]
And this is not a fashion statement, it's elegant intuition
Far beyond your bed wetter kindergarten compositions
This is a part of me
How can you sleep at night when what you don't bite you write half-heartedly?
Go join the army
And be the best you can be
Give a new meaning to blowing up over seas, please!
We kick those doors down when nobody would let us in
And give you that proverbial taste of your own medicine
We took your formula and relabeled it
And sat patiently and giggled when you drank it
Street voice and street cred run just about the same
While flash in the pan bands pop bottles and drop names
And you'll dismiss it cause it ain't what ya used to
But who the fuck died and made you King Koopa?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Travis]
Wow congratulations on your new purchase
I heard you bought a crib on biters block downtown plagiarism's paradise
You're not a movement
You're purely amusement
The poster boy for Xerox and the role model for parasites
You serve no purpose
You're purely decorative
And bore use to death with your auditory sedatives
Oh they don't see
No, we don't sleep
And hog tie your runaway bride with cold feet
We built this city on lock and load logic
And burned it down the same night
So go ahead and put your tears on ice baby
I think we got a winner
And kiss your crucifix your boy's a certified sinner

[Chorus 2x]

[Hook: T.I.]
I'm the truth, tell it, loud weed yellin'
Get it by the pound, we just smoke it, we don't sell it
Ay, ay, what I blow'll make a plane go
Them bitches say "You got some money but you lame"
We blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass
And we blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass
And we blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass
And we blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Man you so lame, just lookin' at you, nigga
While I'm in here no bitch'll give her pussy to you, nigga, no
Uh-uh, she say "Not even with a bank roll"
Cause the king gettin' money when the bank's closed
Yeah, she in her heels on her knees though
Yeah, her nigga call, she don't leave though
Nope, I beat that pussy like she stole somethin'
Uh-huh, then tell that ho get up and roll somethin'
We pourin' up, blowin' gas, weed noisy
She on that molly, won't stop talkin' and annoyin' me
I'm like, "Why don't you suck a nigga's dick or somethin'?
Or take it from behind while you eat a bitch or somethin'"
I like my bitches doubled up like my white cup
I like my pint sealed up, drank poured up
Yup, and you know you don't wanna catch it
You don't wanna see my niggas actin' ratchet with the ratchet

[Hook: T.I.]
I'm the truth, tell it, loud weed yellin'
Get it by the pound, we just smoke it, we don't sell it
Ay, ay, what I blow'll make a plane go
Them bitches say "You got some money but you lame"
We blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass
And we blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass
And we blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass
And we blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
I'm a jet fuel smoker, crazy like the Joker
Suck it 'fore you fuck it is exactly what I told her
Ten bottles, two models, kush sack, it's a jet ride
Go and get my gangsta ass bitch off the west side
Baby daddy face lookin' long, better change that, nigga
Make a nigga drop some change on your lame ass
Bob Marley smoke, spendin' hundred after hundred
Jumped down her throat and in her stomach, now she runnin'
Me and my henchmen, we be gunnin' for the money, blowin' jet fuel
We don't pay for pussy cause we fuck more than we rest, dude
I bet you that your main bitch'll bless boo
And every ho with her when they see me gon' break their neck too
Rich dick in her, I done gave the bitch life support
High in the pussy same way that I was high in court
Flip it, slap it, rub it down, finish, give it back up
Wash the dick off while she roll the kush sack up

[Hook: T.I.]
I'm the truth, tell it, loud weed yellin'
Get it by the pound, we just smoke it, we don't sell it
Ay, ay, what I blow'll make a plane go
Them bitches say "You got some money but you lame"
We blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass
And we blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass
And we blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass
And we blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Better kush if them bitches wanna blow, of the blow
For the hoes who be playin' with their nose, now you know
That the king all about the dollar bills, quarter mil'
In the bag, slappin' bitches on their ass with dollar bills
Ay, you don't like it, ho? You ain't gotta chill then
Leave the lavish match and go back to where you live then
Nope, but you don't wanna do that
How this ho blowin' on me, where her trumpet or her flute at?
I brought a pound and she blew that, see he brought two back
Drunk up a pint of lean, ain't sleepin', now who can do that?
She dippin' all that molly, steady askin' where the food at
You don't believe me? Ask my nigga Jeezy, he can true that
I beat that pussy, blew that, man I ain't gon' finesse it
Man you know what I'm smokin', shawty you ain't gotta check it
You can smell it, this shit I'm blowin' straight up out of D4
I ain't talkin' but it's loud when the weed blow
Yup, like I'm fresh up on the runway
Wheels up, weed loud like gunplay (pow, pow, pow)
On them sucka niggas with their lame ass
You bustas blowin' train smoke, we blowin' plane gas

[Hook: T.I.]
I'm the truth, tell it, loud weed yellin'
Get it by the pound, we just smoke it, we don't sell it
Ay, ay, what I blow'll make a plane go
Them bitches say "You got some money but you lame"
We blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass
And we blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass
And we blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass
And we blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass

[Outro: T.I.]
What you mean, why should you?
I think a more appropriate question would be why not
I mean, look around you
Exceptions to circumstances require exceptions to be made
Would you not consider this exceptional?
Any sane woman would
But it's not so much who I am as what I am
A stand up guy, man of respect
This life of value, you can't just go purchase and put it on, baby
Anybody say they can, they just puttin' on
Aye, you need to check their certification
I keep my paperwork

[Produced by Pharrell]

[Hook: Pharrell]
(Paperwork)
Don't do no business until you check his (paperwork)
And if all else fails, I just hope that this (paperwork)
Wanna swing Bentley doors, blow smoke through the roof
Everything got a cost, they gon' need something on you
(Paperwork)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
ATL, Westside, that's the only home I know
In '85, me and Uncle Quint used to ride around in the big Bronco
Took me up to Charles' Disco, daytime, set me down at the bar
Where I drank Shirley Temple
'Til he walked out with a bag and we got back in the car
"What you wanna be?" he asked "When you grow up big head?"
I just wanna be like you, ridin' round town gettin' bread
We shared a couple laughs, couple summer pass
Uncle Quint ain't nowhere to be found
Later we learn that someone ratted him out
For that reason 10 years he won't be around

[Hook: Pharrell]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Picture me, in '93, I'm the only man I see
Fresh up off the porch
Lookin' for a drop Porsche and a fake ID
Introduce me to the crack game
Rap game was the furthest from my mind
Had a notebook full of rhymes
And a pocket full of crack rock dimes
Time on my side, lil .45 in my jeans
Open fire if you seem to be blocking my dreams, yessir
Welfare, food stamps
Section eight, me and Ma lived in the trap
I said fuck school, it holdin' me back
I wanna bankroll, chasin' after that

[Hook: Pharrell]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Look at me, at 17, livin' on my own, peddlin'
Quarter ki, now and then sellin' weed
Totin' tools, caughtt my first felony
That's one of many, that were to follow
Drinkin' Henney up out the bottle
Tote a choppa I think I'm bein' followed
Family don't think I'll live to see tomorrow
Plenty have a story like mine
Know many of you had a little nine
Know many of you did a little dirt
Too many of us did a little time
Wake up, 10 years of your life passed
When you get your cake up
Don't it seem lil' odd when the Feds on your ass passin' out?

[Hook: Pharrell]

[Bridge: Pharrell & T.I.]
If you think that you high, baby look above you
It's drones in the sky, there's nothing you could do
So left, two, three snap
Right two, three snap
Don't get serious now it's too late for that
Cause they got
Time on my side, lil .45 in my jeans
Open fire if you seem to be blocking my dreams, yessir

[Hook: Pharrell]

[The Notorious B.I.G]

Yes it's me, the B.I.G
Competition ripper ever since 13
Used to steal clothes was considered a thief
Until I started hustlin' on Fulton Street
Makin' loot, knockin' boots on the regular
Pass the microphone I'm the perfect competitor
Jewels and all that, my clothes is all that
Chumps steppin' to me, that's where they took a FALL at!
B.I.G. without burner, that's unheard of
I stay close to mine like Tina on Turner
Quick to smother, a punk motherfucker
Undercover, word to mother, I'm above ya
And I love ya, cause you're a sweet bitch
A crazy crab, the type to make my dick itch
I flow looser than Luther, words ya get used ta
B.I.G. is a born trooper
Like ice cream I scoop ya, my music you wanna get loose ta
Stay dipped, and I'm not a booster
So what'cha got to say? This mackin' word is bond
There's no other assumption, I got it going on
I'm not conceited, my friends tell me this
Even my mother, be noddin' her head to this
Makes her proud to see her one son get loud
Flip on a sucker, and bow to the crowd
Drink a little Hennessy, smoke a blunt or 2 or 3 or 4
Live in action, guaranteed RAW (dumb ass nigga)

[Verse 1]
All in all you've been there for me
You showed me things I would never see
I think I'm ready
By my side you've been waitin'
Respectfully and oh so patient
I think I'm ready
I feel it in my chest as I dance with you
Got so much control you haven't made a move
You give me reassurance in the things you do
And that's why
I think I'm ready

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm not afraid
To go the way but it's my first time
And baby, I know you wanna change the speed
And I'ma let you take the lead but it's my first time
And baby, I'm not afraid
To go the way but it's my first time
And baby I know you wanna change the speed
And I'ma let you take the lead remember it's my first time

[Verse 2]
Arm in arm, eye to eye
As the music plays emotions rise
I think I'm ready
In your eyes I see three words
Hold me tight 'cause I'm about to burst
I think I'm ready
I feel it in my chest as I dance with you
Got so much control you haven't made a move
You give me reassurance in the things you do
And that's why
I think I'm ready

[Chorus + (Backing Vocals)]
(It's my first time
Remember your first time
It's my first time)

[Outro]
It felt like
(Introducing...the world famous)
KRS-ONE, Kenny Parker
Let's Go

[Hook]
Now, let me introduce you to the one
Now, let me introduce you to the one
Now, let me introduce you to the one
One (one), one (one),one (one), one (one)

Now, let me introduce you to the one
Now, let me introduce you to the one
Now, let me introduce you to the one
One (one), one (one), one (one), one (one)

[Verse 1: Krs-One]
When I say "Stop the Violence", what do I mean?
I mean stop with the ignorance of you dumb ass teens
My lyrics are tighter than a hipster's jeans
I got that Malcolm X flow, by any means
Rip any teen
I spit chunky bars
How you hang with me, spitting monkey bars?
When I woo my Tang, I toast the place
My method man, will ghost your face
(Get down)
I hold my space
You rappers capping blanks
That’s why you’re getting Chased like Manhattan Bank
This isn't even my peak
I'm on half a tank
For your whole rap career, for me you have to thank
I'm an old school writer, out for fame
I be in DJ's mugs, like House of Pain
Y'all rappers' is lame
You're not violent
Cuz corporate tyrants are playing you clowns like clients

[?]

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Krs-One]
I spit yesterday and I spit today
I leave rappers on the side of the road like triple A
When I triple my A's like "Ay, Ay, Ay"
I be in more hoods than the KKK
RS-One, you can see I ain't done
I ain't in, cuz frankly, I ain't them
This word I bring, will burn your thing like Burger King
I'm not the police but you felt the sting
Yes, I helped to bring back the art
Cuz your CD and garbage, I can't tell them apart
Me, I had a hell of a start
I don't hustle my flow to my people
And start calling it art
You rappers are all in the dark
Rapping about money when the world economy is just falling apart
I never was about some chart position
And they not either
You better listen up to this teacher
Well...

[Hook]

Johnny Love in the building
Sean, what's up
Mondo, let's go

[Hook]
You said you love me (I said what)
You said you love me (okay let's rock)
You said you love me (I said what)
You said you love me (okay let's rock)

[Verse 1]
You had an ugly tattoo, and fucking cheap perfume
You couldn't dance, barely moved, I didn't know what to do
You had a friend in a band, but they're not that cool
You said you love me (okay let's rock)

[Chorus]
Everything was wrong with you
So breaking up was easy to do
Hated your friends and your family too
So breaking up was easy to do
Breaking up! (Breaking up)
Breaking up! (Breaking up)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You tried to pull this apart and make a brand new start
You tried to drive me to France, we didn't get very far
You said forever but baby I'm not so sure
You said you loved me (okay, let's rock)

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Boy I trap hard, flex new coupes
Boy I'm big Soulja, who the fuck is you?
See my trap boys they be on the news
I be cashin' out on designer shoes
Droptop Benz boy new coupe
I'm big Soulja who the fuck is you?
And my trap boys they be on the news
I be cashin' out on designer shoes

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Boy I go hard ridin' new coupes
I am King Soulja who the fuck is you?
See my young niggas they be on the news
Saw me up in traffic he ain't know what to do
Had a 30 on me, long as a bitch
You ain't gotta ask boy I tote the clips
If you try me, put you in a ditch
I be makin' money like I'm Mitch
These niggas bitch made they really snitch
Ridin' thru the hood, 30 on my hip
Run up on me boy I got that FN
Run up on me boy and you won't talk again

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
I got 50 bricks in my fuckin' stash
Free my nigga Zell, free Kwony Cash
I take them chickens, make 'em take a bath
He say he wanna split it down to half
I need 80 plus and fuck the math
I cash out, I don't do the tab
2015 Tesla I do the dash
Ridin' thru the hood and you know I smash
TV screen lookin' like an iPad
Ridin' round town with like 9 grats
Run up on me wrong boy I'm a blast
And your baby momma, you know I smashed
Ridin' thru the hood smellin' like gas
Pourin' up lean, and I'm countin' cash
Got a bad bitch with a fat ass
Boy I trap hard, boy I count cash
Broad day pistols, tools they blast
Money on me, boy I got a bag
Boy I check a flag like I check a bag
SODMG, we runnin' it
Run up on me wrong I'm a spray ya flat
Choppa hit ya front, lay you on your back
Run up on ya house you get kidnapped
All I need is 9 but this Tec's mad
100k, that be in one day
I just hit a lick for like 60 ki's
They call me young Pablo E
Blowin' on dope, with no seeds
Run up on me wrong you get RIP'd
With my young shooters and they totin' heat
Big ass gun knock you off your feet
I'm a trap hard til I rest in peace

Sittin' first class, feelin' like shit though
Starin' out the window with the mind of a schizo
Thinkin' if I jump, will I feel it when I hit the ground?
Fuck that, I want the crown off anybody head
I wouldn't care if everybody's dead
It's why I keep the pump shotty layin' in the bed
Have a fuckin' sleepover with my weapons
My Rambo knife is eatin' nuggets with my Smith & Wesson
Shit, I made this out of nothin'
Damn, these ladies love me out in London
Laurenivici served the granulated onion
My mind is locked in a contaminated dungeon
Dog, what the fuck is with your mother?
She got one leg longer than the other
One eye through the shutter
Made the transition from weed to butter, like spring to summer

[Hook: Action Bronson & Black Atlass]
I nearly lost my mind
All a motherfucker got is time, time, time
Time, time
I nearly lost my brain
Dealin' with this motherfuckin' pain, so bad
So bad, I'm so glad
I nearly lost my mind
All a motherfucker got is time, time, time
Time, time
I nearly lost my brain
Dealin' with this motherfuckin' pain, so bad
So bad, I'm so glad

I nearly lost my brain
Dealin' with this motherfuckin' pain, so bad
So bad, I'm so glad
I don't know what point exactly it started to be a problem, I just remember liking it more and more, whenever people would try to help me I would say get that fucking person outta here, I can't believe they said that shit to me, they don't know anything about me or my life. It's not like I'm out here snorting coke or shooting heroin up my arm.

It's either you have a problem and can you control it or you can't, I literally thought I could control it until I overdosed during Christmas of 2007. Had I got to the hospital about two hours later, I would have died. My organs were shutting down. My liver, kidneys, everything. They were gonna have to put me on dialysis, they didn’t think I was gonna make it.

I remember coming out of rehab and relapsing and shooting right back up to where I was when I overdosed. I was ransacking my whole house just looking for a stash of Vicodin that I maybe hidden away and then I found some in my basement wrapped up it was the extra strength ones.

After I got out of rehab I did not sleep for three week straights I mean like not even nodding off for a fucking minute I would just sit up and stare at my TV.

I would walk around my house and thinking every single day, "I'm gonna fucking die." I'm looking at my kids, and like, I need to be here for them. I'm growing. I just couldn’t believe that anybody could be naturally happy or naturally function or be just enjoying life in general without being on something

The doctors told me I'd done the equivalent of four bags of heroin,
I was addicted Valium, Ambien, the numbers got so high I didn't even know what I was taking anymore. It never once hit me that drug addiction runs in my family, now that I understand that I’m an addict, I definitely have compassion for my mother. I get it now.

I wanted to make an overall statement — I’m back. It was a slow process. You gotta remember I hadn’t recorded a song sober in seven years. So it took me a while to even feel like I could record a song sober … I don’t know the last time I shot a video sober, without drinking or taking anything. It’s been years.

I almost feel like a little kid again with rap, I wanna play around with different flows. If I don’t feel like it’s what I’m fully capable of, if there’s one weak line, I wanna change it. Rap was my drug It used to get me high and then it stopped getting me high. Then I had to resort to other things to make me feel that. Now rap’s getting me high again.

So I would say to anybody, it does get better, you know. It just does.

[Intro: Hozier]
I have never known peace
Like the damp grass that yields to me
I have never known hunger
Like these insects that feast on me

[Verse 1: Hozier]
A thousand teeth
And yours among them, I know
Our hungers appeased
Our heartbeats becoming slow

[Pre-Chorus 1: Karen Cowley & Hozier, Karen Cowley, Hozier]
We'll lay here for years or for hours
Thrown here or found, to freeze or to thaw
So long, we'd become the flowers
Two corpses we were, two corpses I saw

[Chorus 1: Karen Cowley & Hozier]
And they'd find us in a week
When the weather gets hot
After the insects have made their claim
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you

[Verse 2: Karen Cowley]
I have never known sleep
Like this slumber that creeps to me
I have never known colour
Like this morning reveals to me

[Verse 3: Karen Cowley]
And you haven't moved an inch
Such that I would not know
If you sleep always like this
The flesh calmly going cold

[Pre-Chorus 2: Karen Cowley & Hozier, Karen Cowley,  Hozier]
We'll lay here for years or for hours
Your hand in my hand, so still and discreet
So long, we'd become the flowers
We'd feed well the land and worry the sheep

[Chorus 2: Karen Cowley & Hozier]
And they'd find us in a week
When the cattle show fear
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you...

[Bridge:  Karen Cowley, Hozier]
They'd find us in a week (We lay here for years or for hours)
When the weather gets hot (So long we become the flowers)
And they'd find us in a week (We lay here for years or for hours)
When the cattle show fear (So long we become the flowers)

[Verse 4: Karen Cowley & Hozier]
And they'd find us in a week
When the buzzards get loud
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste

[Outro: Karen Cowley & Hozier]
After the raven has had his say
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]x4
Got the club going up on a Tuesday
Got yo girl in the cut and she choosy

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I heard a rumor I was broke
They said Luda ain't got no green backs
You people must be smokin', dope
So kill yourself you if you believe that
Forbes lits cash king, 8 years in a row
In fact I'm still  making money
Off that song, "You's a Ho"
These artists scare of success
Money and power they abuse it
Instead of making up these lies
Why don't ya'll make some better music
I'm back rapping and going strong
Like I'm with Tigger in the basment
Album taken to fuckin, long
I told my fans, just to be patient
I told em' I apologize, been doin too other work
Too many people talkin' shit
Now Luda's, got to go bezerk
EP comin' in Decemeber
Just talking bout how it hurts
And finally that Ludaversal
It's dropping March 31st
And Imma have the club up

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]4x

[Verse 2: ILoveMakonnen]
Working Monday night, on the corner flipping hard
Made at least three thousand, on the Boulevard
I've been working graveyard, shifts every other weekend
Ain't got no fucking time to party on the weekend
I've been flipping in the house, making juugs on the highway
I've been riding out of state, making money like my way
I don't think that I should dance, I'm just gon have another drink
I'm doing my stance, you know my Molly pink
I've got the loudest of the loud, you know my gas stink
My P.O. think I'm in the house, don't give a damn about what she think

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]x4
Oh my baby baby
I love you more than I can tell
I don't think I can live without you
And I know that I never will

Oh my baby baby
I want you so it scares me to death
I can't say anymore than "I love you"
Everything else is a waste of breath

I want you
You've had your fun you don't get well no more
I want you
Your fingernails go dragging down the wall
Be careful darling you might fall

I want you
I woke up and one of us was crying
I want you
You said "Young girl I do believe you're dying"
I want you
If you need a second opinion as you seem to do these days
I want you
You can look in my eyes and you can count the ways
I want you
Did you mean to tell me but seem to forget?
I want you
Since when were you so generous and inarticulate?
I want you
It's the stupid details that my heart is breaking for
It's the way your shoulders shake and what they're shaking for
I want you
It's knowing that she knows you now after only guessing
I want you
It's the thought of her undressing you or you undressing

I want you
She tossed some tattered compliment your way
I want you
And you were fool enough to love it when she said
"I want you"

I want you
The truth can't hurt you, it's just like the dark
It scares you witless
But in time you see things clear and stark
I want you
Go on and hurt me now and then let it drop
I want you
I'm afraid I won't know where to stop
I want you
I'm not ashamed to say I cried for you
I want you
I want to know the things you did that we do too
I want you
I want to hear she pleases you more than I do
I want you
I might as well be useless for all it means to you
I want you
Did you call her name out as she held you down?
I want you
But no my darling, not with that clown
I want you, I do
I want you
You've had your fun you don't get well no more
I want you
No one who wants you could want you more

I want you
I want you
I want you
Every night when I go off to bed
And when I wake up
I want you
I'm going to say it once again 'til I instill it
I know I'm going to feel this way until you kill it
I want you
I want you

[Verse 1]
Heaven please send to all mankind
Understanding and peace of mind

[Chorus]
But if it's not asking too much
Please send me someone to love
Someone to love

[Verse 2]
Show the world how to get along
And peace will enter when hate is gone

[Chorus]
But if it's not asking too much
Please send me someone to love
Please send me someone to love

I lay awake nights and ponder the world all trouble
And my answer is always the same
That unless men put an end to this damnable sin
Hate will put the world in a flame, what a shame

[Verse 3]
Just because I'm in misery
I don't beg for no sympathy

[Chorus]
But if it's not asking too much
Please send me someone to love
Please send me someone to love

[Verse 4]
Just because I'm in misery
I don't beg for no sympathy

[Chorus]
But if it's not asking too much
Please send me someone to love
Please send me someone to love

[Verse 1]
I'm sentimental, so I walk in the rain
I've got some habits even I can't explain
Go to the corner and I end up in Spain
Why try to change me now?

[Verse 2]
I sit and daydream, I got daydreams galore
Cigarette ashes, there they go on the floor
Go away weekends, leave my keys in the door
Why try to change me now?

[Chorus 1]
Why can't I be more conventional?
People talk and they stare, so I try
But that can't be 'cause I can't see
My strange little world just go passing me by

Let people wonder, let 'em laugh, let 'em frown
You know I'll love you till the moon's upside down
Don't you remember I was always your clown
Why try to change me now?

[Chorus 2]
Why can't I be more conventional?
People talk and they stare, so I try
But that can't be because I can't see
My strange little world just go passing me by

So let people wonder, let 'em laugh, let 'em frown
You know I'll love you till the moon's upside down
Don't you remember I was always your clown
So why try to change me?
Why would you want to change me?
Why try to change me now?

[Verse]
Pretending that we'll meet
Each time I turn a corner
I walk a little faster
Pretending life is sweet
'Cause love's around the corner
I walk a little faster

[Chorus]
Can't begin to see my future shine as yet
No sign as yet, you're mine as yet
Rushing to a face I can't define as yet
Keep bumping into walls and taking lots of falls

And even though I meet 'round each and every corner
With nothing but disaster
I set my chin a little higher, I hope a little longer
Build a little stronger castle in the air
And thinking you'll be there
I walk a little faster
Can't begin to see my future shine as yet
No sign as yet, you're mine as yet
Rushing to a face I can't define as yet
Keep bumping into walls and taking lots of falls

But even though I meet 'round each and every corner
With nothing but disaster
I set my chin a little higher, I hope a little longer
Build a little stronger castle in the air
And thinking you'll be there
I walk a little faster

[Verse 1]
Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
Take a look and you'll see
Into your imagination

We'll begin with a spin
Traveling in a world of my creation
What we'll see will defy
Explanation

[Chorus]
If you want to view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
Want to change the world
There's nothing to it

[Verse 2]
There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there, you'll be free
If you truly wish to be

[Chorus]
If you want to view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
Want to change the world
There's nothing to it

[Intro]
Nightmares! Some come true
Never let your guard down
No one is immune
Anything that can will happen
Such is the story lived through Elisa
Stuck in time

[Verse 1]
Checking into the hotel
Taunted by the building itself
And I wonder if the walls spoke
Would they share the cruelest dreams
Would they tell about the murders in the bedrooms?
Or of suicide by jumping out of their rooms?
Or the stalker on the top floor?
Don’t go looking, don’t go looking!

[Hook]
She’s there
Stuck in time
(Disappearing Syndrome)
She’s there
(Disappearing)
Flowing through the water pipes

[Chorus]
Stolen by the history
Led above to where we drink
Laid to rest, laid to rest
Found in a liquid nest

[Verse 2]
Haunting demeanor
Gone away
You won’t be erased
Gone away

What is it they covered up?

[Verse 3]
The elevator camera hints at what could have happened
And I wonder if the walls spoke
Would they share the same thing
A couple weeks to find the human marination
Consuming water with her flesh contamination
Was this all a result of possession?
Don’t go looking, don’t go looking!

[Hook]
She’s there
Stuck in time
(Disappearing Syndrome)
She’s there
(Disappearing)
Flowing through the water pipes
Flowing, flowing through the water pipes

[Bridge]
That’s where, that’s where they found her
What is it they covered up, they covered up?
One thing we know that’s for sure
That her vessel laid unmoved
Did she feel pain when her life left?
Was she gone before the splash?
Maybe this is happening exactly as intended;
Mastering a story that never will be ended
What if it’s an artist that performed a final piece?
Crafting a legend, Crafting a legend

[Chorus]
Stolen by the history
Led above to where we drink
Laid to rest, laid to rest
Found in a liquid nest

[Outro]
Haunting demeanor
(Gone away)
You won’t be erased
(Gone away)
(Gone away)

Rich Gang

[Verse 1]
Before YouTube I walked through life, and now I frolic
YouTube's been like a father to me
Except YouTube's not an alcoholic
Before YouTube I was just a skinny white kid
That thought he was funnier and cooler
Than he actually was
And now, well not much has changed
But I have a shitload of money
Because YouTube is a place for people to share their ideas
If by people you mean 13-year-old girls
And by ideas you mean how they love the Jonas Brothers
I'm just kidding
But let's be honest, that's a hefty majority
And if you don't believe me
Well then you must be a noob

[Chorus]
So, welcome to YouTube
And you don't know what you're missing
Just try searching "Women Kissing"
It's YouTube
It's what this country's been needing
A generation of kids who don't waste their time reading
Am I the only one who thinks that Lisa Nova's hot?
And Chris Crocker's not...
No, he's hotter

[Verse 2]
Most of the best YouTubers are either Asian or they're gay
So there's an untapped YouTube celebrity
And his name is George Takei
And your favorite coat's got a doo-doo stain
I pray to god that that's chocolate rain
And I find videos of babies laughing a bit intrusive
Because Barack Obama won the election because of YouTube
Wait, did I say YouTube? I meant the black vote
And I think YouTube and Fred are so cool! (so stupid)
And What The Buck will be back in a Jiffy Lube

[Chorus x2]
So, welcome to YouTube
Welcome to YouTube
Hey, welcome to YouTube!

[Verse 3]
I said, listen and linger
Charlie the Unicorn bit my finger!
It's YouTube
The impact is evident
Miss Teen South Carolina just ran for Vice President
Upload a video, you got nothing to lose
Except all of your friends
And the approval of your parents
"Hi, my name is Mary, and I'm 19 years old and I got drunk at a party, and I think someone was video-taping it, but I don't want anyone to see it, 'cause I showed half of my boob"
Sorry, Mary!

[Outro]
Welcome to YouTube
Say "Hello" to YouTube
And say goodbye to your college scholarship
And if your video doesn't appeal to me
You gotta change the key... word
Welcome to YouTube, oh
I said welcome to YouTube, yeah
And it will keep on going and it'll never stop
Until it's privatized

[Verse 1: Sam Martin]
You take me down, spin me around
You got me running all the lights
Don't make a sound, talk to me now
Let me inside your mind

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Martin]
I don't know what you're thinking, sugar, ooh
But I just got that feeling, sugar, ooh
I can hear the sirens burning
Red lights turning
I can't turn back now
So hold on tight

[Chorus: Sam Martin]
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Detain the dangerous
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 2: Sam Martin]
Show me your soul, I gotta know
Bet that you're beautiful inside
Toes on the gas, car moving fast
Come take the wheel and drive

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Martin]
I don't know what you're thinking, sugar, ooh yeah
And I just got that feeling, sugar, ooh yeah
I can hear the sirens burning
Red lights turning
I can't turn back now
So hold on tight

[Chorus: Sam Martin]
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Detain the dangerous
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Detain the dangerous

[Bridge: Sam Martin]
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again
Come on baby
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again

[Chorus: Sam Martin]
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby this is getting serious
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Detain the dangerous
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Detain the dangerous
I've never written a book in my life
‘Cause your tiny brains would never get it
Me compared to Shakespeare's like
Shakespeare compared to Shakespeare's wife

I gave you everything, but
I gave you simple minds so you made simple things
I gave you healthy birds;
You made chicken wings
I gave you nipples;
You made nipple rings

You’re not going to Heaven
Why would you EVER think I’d hang out with you?
You’re all dicks;
I don’t need you
I know a million aliens cooler than you
So fuck you

[Chorus]
Oh my
I said oh my god
Oh my, oh my god
I’m not gonna fix you
I’m not gonna fix you
I said oh my, oh my god
People give me money but I don’t know why
‘cause my real collection plate
Is an empty cup held by a homeless guy

I made every girl different and
They’re all perfect just the way they are
People tell them different
And people are smart
Right! I just made the stars

You think you know beauty
Love
Trust me you don’t;
I’m the one who created them

You’re overpopulated
So I slaved for days
Making gays
And you ended up hating them!
Fuck you!

[Chorus]

I've created many beings
But you’re the strangest that I've ever met
You think that you're my children
But you’re more like an annoying pet
The Messiah
Made the people wonder
Heavenly whether he’s me
But I’m not into saving people
Who might nail me to a fucking tree

You’re all
Angry
Crying
Sad
And lost
You worship power and wealth
The more that I watch you the less I believe in myself

[Chorus]

You’re looking for answers that won’t be found
No!
How many answers can a raindrop find
Before it hits the ground?

You think I kill you people
You ask me "why?" when a child dies
Why would I kill someone
When a hundred years passes when I blink my eyes?

[Verse 1]
We don't even talk anymore
And we don't even know what we argue about
Don't even say "I love you" no more
Cause saying how we feel is no longer allowed
Some people work things out
And some just don't know how to change

[Chorus]
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it, baby

[Verse 2]
Now, now they can see the tears in our eyes
But we deny the pain that lies deep in our hearts
Well, maybe that's a pain we can't hide
Cause everybody knows that we're both torn apart
Why do we hurt each other?
Why do we push love away?

[Chorus]
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it, baby

Some people will work things out
And some just don't know how to change

[Chorus]
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it, baby
Don't do it, baby
Don't do it, baby
Swinging against the wind
Keeping the noose tight on her skin
God will save her
The father’s Lucifer they say
Oh, do they?
Does that make it OK?
Sin finds the culprit
Unexplained circumstances cause people to fear, deceive
And act so irrationally

Up in the bedroom, she’s seeing ghosts
(Demons in clothes, people she knows)
Swear on the bible, that earns their trust
(Fractions of fiction dismissed so start your hunt)

[Chorus]
Terror is the grease that runs the system
(Let ‘em burn)
To assist them in control
(Manipulation)
Let ‘em burn!
We submit
We submit
Aren’t we all JUST okay?
Who’s the real culprit?!
No one mentions the secret intentions
You’d lose your mind
You’d lose your mind
Bind us, Strip us, Crush us!

Burning flesh:
Nobody can stand the smell
Capture and torture victims that we’re afraid of
Fear will sell
Then murder is justified
Now who’s the monster
(Let ‘em burn)
Now who’s the monster!

[Chorus]

Cold sweat dripping
I was on their radar
Scaffold gripping
We’re all on their radar

Callous crimes intimidate
Countless times
Intoxicate
(We submit)
Let them pray
Let them pray for us
Evil tips the scale
Burning flesh:
Nobody can stand the smell
Capture and torture victims that we’re afraid of
Fear will sell
Then murder is justified
Bodies swaying aren’t worth saving

They all make us watch

And as I hung there I noticed how you
How you all just stood there
Like stone, you stood there
And as I hung there I noticed how you
How you all just stood there!
The fear kept you there
And I watched you

Callous crimes intimidate
Countless times
Intoxicate
Let them pray
Let them pray for us
Evil tips the scale

[Hook]
I'm in the kitchen cooking babies in my long johns
3 Swishers put together, that's a long one
I got a Bankhead bitch
That bitch from Zone 1
I said the trappin' gonna catch up in the long run
I'm in the kitchen tryna make it do the long jump
Big knots in my jeans, look like speed bumps
Look like speed bumps, look like speed bumps
Big knots in my jeans, look like speed bumps

[Verse 1]
I swear I seen it
You never seen it
I really seen it
1017 and what’s the meanin
Y'all really mean it
The cleaners
Blocks in your tires and you can’t peek the meters
When I scream it
I really mean it, won’t see the evening
Man, I’m freezing
So fuckin cold that it got me sneezing
There Four Seasons
These stripper hoes will suck me till I'm sleepin’
Leaving Magic, I’m drunk as fuck, so you know we weavin’
Ain’t no secret
You niggas know that i don’t fuck with Jeezy
It was tragic, wars everywhere, they say the boy was bleeding
It was easy
I eat yo crew up like some Reese’s Pieces
This is street shit
So once you say this shit you can’t delete it
Twice a week, bitch
My plug would pull up, and drop me off the pieces

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I bought all of the sessions, ain’t no sessions left
A 150 bottles, but I’m by myself
I’m fresh as hell
Pocket full of dollar bills
On the real, I buy the deal
I push weight like I’m in the gym
You better chill
Before I kidnap and ransom one of your relatives
And when that pistol in your face
You have no choice, you better kill
None of y’all niggas got better dope
None of y’all niggas got better pills
Y’all don’t know about popping seals

[?] re-rocking squares
It's Gucci Man and Mike Will
So you chillin’ with a bunch of players
Say that you a gangsta bitch
But came in with a bunch of squares
Louboutin's with pony hair
In magic with money bear TIP Kuntry Mac Boney there
I’m wasted standing on furniture
All wasted standing on furniture

OutKast:
Ten years long, ten years strong
Lastin' long, verses long lastin'
Education, however, the difference between the two --
Which do you live, yo'self?
Luck of the draw, master plan without a flaw

Somethin' lastin' long leaves the compromising position --
Everything that isn't becomes questionable, unbelievable, and becomes weak at some point --
Done got straight blowed after hitting some danker's joint

Somethin' long lastin' --
Big Boi and 'Dre, the duos who chemistry gave a potion of rare fate:
Two Atlanta boys that became men of this industry
For them same ol' boys to be OutKast, raps out-blast and outlast the peers of the game
Move with the groove an' don't let the smooth groove fool you;
S'all that it is, believe in the dirty Southernplayalisticadillac-funky-ATLiens:
Together, makes Aquemini
Big Boi and 'Dre presents OutKast
So get ready to bump 808-style
To "The Speakerboxxx" and "The Love Below"
Two albums, but same ol' flow
Y'all enjoy it, y'hear?
Signin' off, man --
AKA
Flossin' man 

[?]
Talkin' hanging out wit' the D-Boi's
You know you a D-Boi
Cause when someone frontin' something 'S like havin' two daddies
One time my home boy fronted me a 8 ball at 3 oclock
At 4:30 he wanted the money back

It's rough bein' on that thang man
How you gonna front me somebody done fronted you?
He ain't no real real hustler, the dude shootin' at both of us
Hit you wit' a quarter pound talkin' bout 'we coming up'

A real D-Boi know you gotta get you own work
And you don't get high off your own supply
Til later on at night

I gotta drop of 'bout 30 keys
Car keys
Oh baby, we really clean
Really sharp
I mean, in person, baby, in person!
Ha, ha!
Superfly, baby

Oh, around the world they talk about us
Do you have any idea on how good it feels to be me right now?
Oh yeah, I got them pink ones, too
Oh yeah, but I know how to wear em though, baby

Look, watch out!
Them gators gon' bite ya
Watch out now!

Speakerboxx!

Hope somebody got a couple limbs they can lend ya
Cause I'm the President, run up in ya resident
Say hello to the (gunshot) baddest bitch ya ever met
Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, buck
Sawed-off followed by the Mossberg Pump
When I come through it get hotter than a soup kitchen

Straight up, you can take this with you on the way down
Or way up, as long as my money gets paid up
My weight up, don't come into my lane with no layups
Get ate up, you see how much space your boy take up
Usually I'm calm though but when it come to long dough
I don't aim for the vest, hit you from the face up
When it's in a palm dough turn into a John Doe
I'm psycho, I think about this shit when I wake up
I don't want to starve kids, I want y'all to all live
So I'm gonna retire in a Lambo like Favre did
Aw shit, news flash dummy, I'm acting juvenile, that new cash money

Fuck the rain I'll walk back home

I can't find you
I can feel you're here
And now when you fall asleep you'll think tonight
You might just dream of me

That's why I'm not asleep right now; I  can barely open my eyes

You said you know she slept with him

Now the telephone rang when you weren't getting any answer
You said you know she slept with him

Just know that my time I'm taking it
For the right time I'm waiting
So gone
Jump bad if you want to, get mad if you want to
Gone
Show your ass if you want to, but I'mma blast when I want to
Dre coming, bow down, no options
Big money off and them is no problem
Hard times, niggas out just starving
With no blow, broke niggas get started dog
Niggas plotting trying to rob, don't dodge it naw
Listen closely and I'mma tell you how to solve them y'all
Get your fifty-thousand dollars fly them AUGs in
Pass them choppers out and see what you niggas rob then
Just let them follow you, like they going to try and do
But bet their brilliant ass don't know their being followed to
Going about your business man
Now all you got to do is introduce the robbing crew to who you gave them choppers to
Then watch tomorrow's news, you'll see a car dude, shot down, laid out, look like the car that was trying to follow you
Somehow the follower became the follwee
Man I’m a shark, think a guppy finna swallow me?
Out his motherfucking mind niggas got to be
You follow me I'mma blast with no apology

[Pre-Chorus: Ralph Tresvant]
Uh yeah baby oooooooh, listen to me, oh yeaaaah

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the thriller in Manila
Honeys call me Bigga the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the epilogue by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I'm in thirteens, know what I mean
I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder, it doesn't matter
Skinny or fat or light-skinned or black, baby, I drop these
Boricua mommies screamin' "Ay papi!"
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled propa
Look, I gotcha caught up with the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote da fo'-fo'
For niggas gettin' mad cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G ya see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Gettin' Physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So gimme a ho, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her till her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-town in ya, you'll want that old thing back

[Chorus: Ralph Tresvant]
What you wanna do?
I got that old thing back
What you wanna see?
Baby, sing relax and feel
What you be, where you are
You wouldn't start

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Bitches screamin' they want that old thing back
Like B I Double G I E
With some new R-U-L-E
Notorious known for bustin' in ya E-Y-E, baby baby!
Bitches know they love to hate me
I come, you come, we come, with back some maybe
How close we came to coming together is crazy
How come you and your sis make similar faces
When I come you be cryin' like I'm killin' ya bitches
Knows when picture in the camera rollin
Cause I only be knowin' how the shit's unfolded
Back shots to the rear, got the mac unloaded
Got a reload, like every so often
You sayin' I got my swagger back
I'm lookin' like bitch, my swagger never left
It's so hard pressed, to be impressed by these new rappers
They actors, and the fact is, you want that old thing back
Shit...

[Chorus: Ralph Tresvant]
What you wanna do?
I got that old thing back
What you wanna see?
Baby, sing relax and feel
What you be, where you are
You wouldn't start

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G.]
Is my mind playin' tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, havin' nightmares of girls killin' me
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past let's dwell on the 500 SL, the E and J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rim with Benjamins
Another hon's in the crib, please send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips a lot, used to lick the clits a lot
But lickin' clits had to stop
Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow, really though
I got the cleanest meanest penis, ya never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your bodysuit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex gettin' rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase em, I replace em
And if I'm caressin' em, I'm undressin' em
Fuck whatcha heard who's the best in New York
Fulfillin' fantasies without that nigga Mr. Roarke
Or Tattoo I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I'm done I got to split shit
Back shots is my position, I gotcha wishin' for an intermission
Fuck the kissin', lickin' down to your belly button, I ain't frontin'
They don't call me B.I.G. for nuttin, all of a sudden

[Chorus: Ralph Tresvant]
What you wanna do?
I got that old thing back
What you wanna see?
Baby, sing relax and feel
What you be, where you are
You wouldn't start

[Verse 1: T.I]
Aye I done lost my temper,went and grabbed my pistol
Now before you know it I be hanging out the window
Air it out my nigga, Lights out my nigga
Down to do 100 years bout my nigga
Squeeze automatic triggers till it ain't a bullet left
No mask, bare face, I came to do it myself
Pump on my back choppa at hand another two in my belt
Know a couple hundred killers but Im refusing the help

An Fuck any nigga who don't like it you got that

Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow

I wanna show you off like a trophy car, whip it
'Cause anything is better than nothing at all
Nothing at all, nothing on you
I just wanna show you a table for two
All you did was go on a date with a dude
You know he don't fit, he ain't tailored for you

A gorgeous skin tan, hit the mall to do damage
The way she hit the high notes, we all gon' have Grammys

Tiptoein' from the counter, to the shower, for a hour
Super powers, super powers
That's that mojo, Austin Powers
Search "real nigga", I'ma pop up in your browser

Put you on game girl, so it's obvious

Sue
The clinic called
The x-ray's fine

Sue, the virgin on your stone
For your grave
Why too dark to speak the words?
For, I know that you have a son
Oh, folly, Sue

[Verse 4]
Ride the train, I'm far from home
In a season of crime none need atone
I kissed your face
Sue, I've pushed you down beneath the weeds
Endless faith in hopeless deeds
I kissed your face
I touched your face

[Bridge]
Sue, goodbye

[Outro]
Sue, I found your note
That you wrote last night
It can't be right
You went with him
Sue, I never dreamed
I'm such a fool
Right from the start
You went with that clown

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, Growin' up in that slum
Tatted all on my chest just to let y'all know where I'm from
Uh, Haters, I don't see none
Goin' hard day, day Lord knows I want the best for my son
So I got Chuck Tays on my feet, and I got bitches smokin' my chief
And I got all my dogs with me, anyone starvin', man they gon' eat
And we don't do deceit
We do real big receipts
We do first class cabin seats
If you ain't gonna stand for nothin', have a seat

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Cause I'm a real one, that's all day, foreign cars, that's all day
Goin' hard, that's all day, I'm gettin' money the long way
I'm a real one, that's all day, foreign cars, that's all day
Goin' hard, that's all day, I'm gettin' money the long way
I don't know much about y'all but I've been hustlin' all day
I don't know much about y'all but I've been countin' all day
Nah nah n-n-nah nah, nah nah heyyyyyyyy-y-y-y

[Interlude: John Cena]
Looks like you lettin' 'em know what going all day is all about
Well, it's Mr. All Day

[Verse 2: John Cena]
Y'all 'bout to find God, make you an instant preacher
They should have never let Cena spit with Wiz Khalifa
We all day fam, hotter than a sauna
I'm not from Chi city but I'm common on the corner
We always hustle hard, you ballin' incidental
I'm 'bout to go on trial, murderin' instrumentals
I dumb it down for you, I keep it simple, son
I need four fingers, I'm givin' you the middle one

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Cause I'm a real one, that's all day, foreign cars, that's all day
Goin' hard, that's all day, I'm gettin' money the long way

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
I tried to tell these boys I ain't lyin'
Put it in their faces so they can get their cake like mine
But man they keep hatin' and I can't see the reason why
Why when I get a plate they keep tryna take it
Put 'em in their places

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Cause I'm a real one, that's all day, foreign cars, that's all day
Goin' hard, that's all day, I'm gettin' money the long way

Listen, tie us off and take us both to heaven
Isn't this nice?
Isn't this nice?

Pull back! Pull back!
I'm starting to feel the burn of missed injection
All blue and black
It’s so hard to navigate this map of scars that is my skin

Fester
Listen, tie us off and take us both to heaven
Isn't this nice?
Isn't this nice?

Pull back! Pull back!
I wish that my love for you they wouldn't question
It’s all we have, along with our half cut pens with hollowed insides
Similar to yours and mine

Baby, every day I see you and me getting high with each other
Baby, long as we got this pipe I see us growing older together
Tired ticking time bomb
Shot to shit and all wrong

Still we pretend that our lives do not consist of chasing shit that helps us cope with how we see ourselves
Everything we say is a lie, is a lie

Breathing underwater
Breathing underwater

Feel the burn!
Maybe you hit a nerve?
I don't fucking think it’s working!
Hold me underwater
Hold me underwater

Still we pretend that our lives do not consist of chasing shit that helps us cope with how we see ourselves
Everything we say is a lie, is a lie
Is a lie we actually believe...

[Verse 1]
They're all watching like they know her
Foreign nightmare never over
Judging by their eyes
They've made up their mind

[Refrain]
Locked away
Now they're taking her, overstay
And they're keeping her
Let's appease the cameras watching
Face of an angel
Let's appease the cameras watching
So controversial

[Chorus]
Honesty wasn't mirrored by justice
Devil in the people’s court
Honesty wasn't mirrored by justice
Our city, it falls apart at the core
She'll stand there wondering what it’s all for
Media coverage is biased at best
Falsified theories are fucking with everyone's head

[Verse 2]
Cold and still found in the back room
Carnage all over the wall for all to see
Prosecutor’s mind was made up
False accuser, clear vendetta
Judging by his lies, she's been victimized

[Refrain]
Locked away
Now they're taking her, overstay
And they're keeping her
Face of an angel
So controversial

[Bridge]
In Perugia, she’ll stay!
In Perugia, she’ll stay!

[Hook]
Black serotonin aimed at those with blue eyes

[Verse 3]
People are sick
And we all like to witness
Suffering souls

[Break]
She'll sit alone 

[x8]

[Chorus]
Honesty wasn't mirrored by justice
Devil in the people’s court
Honesty wasn't mirrored by justice
Our city, it falls apart at the core
She'll stand there wondering what it’s all for
Media coverage is biased at best
Falsified theories are fucking with everyone's head

[Coda]
Cold and still found in the back room
Carnage all over the wall for all to see

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
They try to make me slow down, but I live with the brakes off
They tell me I should hold up, but I live with the brakes off
Brakes off, brakes off, brakes off
And we're going up, up, up, up
Brakes off, brakes off

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
First place in the race
Either first or you're last, my foot stays on the gas
Floatin', ain't take much from out the class
Open the Forbes see a young nigga 'bout his
Hear people talking 'bout their dreams, he really living out his
They hating just to hate, but they don't really doubt it
My eyes stay on the prize
Told EI realised that love built this
So I'll be damned if you be fake, kill it
Put my all in, make 'em feel it
Show me them people who think it's bosses
I'll make them look like children
Top floor of the building, ordering drinks, rolling up
Planes all in the same, goes without saying
Y'all know the slang, no pain, no gain, let's get it

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

[Verse 2: John Cena]
I'm making ground mine, you taking downtime
Every word is "hustle", the whole entire sound shine
Chasing the finer things, shining like diamond rings
Gemstone flow, that's the clarity my rhyming brings
King with the cold voice, I'm such a rogue choice
Tailored suit, pulling up in that Rolls Royce
Drop-head coupe, suicide doors
Arriving like Sinatra, Louis Vuitton floors
I'm talking 'bout my shoes, I'm chalking up your crews
I'mma give away the end, partner y'all about to lose
That's just the way it goes, don't take it to heart B
I say you're just a friend cause my biz is the marquee

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
They try to make me slow down, brakes off, brakes
They tell me I should hold up, brakes off, brakes off
They try to make me slow down, brakes off, brakes off
They tell me I should hold up, brakes off
But I live with the brakes off

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

[Verse 1]
When I talk, you listen, I like that
When you listen, you smile and I like that
Why you lookin', lookin' at me just like that?
I like that
I like that

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's a crime scene on the dance floor
Ring the alarm
Police tape on the front door
And you are

[Chorus]
A person of interest
A person of interest
Can't say I'm in love yet, but certainly impressed
You are a person of interest
A person of interest
Can't say that it's love yet, but somebody's obsessed

[Verse 2]
When we're dancing real close, think I like ya
But when the lights go down low, I can't find ya
Now I can't get you outta my mind, yeah
It's a crime, yeah
It's a crime

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's a chalk line on the dance floor
In the shape of my heart
Crime scene tape on the front door
And you are

[Chorus]
A person of interest
A person of interest
Can't say I'm in love yet, but certainly impressed
You are a person of interest
A person of interest
Can't say that it's love yet, but somebody's obsessed

[Bridge]
Can't deny, you're implicated
In the mayhem in my mind
Why's this got me so frustrated?
You should be mine, you should be mine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's a crime scene on the dance floor
Ring the alarm
Police tape on the front door
And you are

[Chorus]
A person of interest
A person of interest
Can't say I'm in love yet, but certainly impressed
You are a person of interest
A person of interest
Can't say that it's love yet, but somebody's obsessed

[Verse 1]
Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (Then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)

[Verse 2]
Looking at it now
Last December (Last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (Back together)
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? (Oh) Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)

[Bridge]
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out, I said, "I'm setting you free"
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me, ooh
You were looking at me
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?)
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?)
I remember
(Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?)
(Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good)
Oh, I remember

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Yeah, yeah)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? (Say, are we?)
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah) Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Clear yet? Good)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Do you remember?)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good

[Intro: T.I.]
Ay, and nigga P said he wanted inspiration (Damn P)
I was really more on some "fuck the world" shit so let's see
(Fuck these niggas man, real talk)
I'm a man of respect, man of the people
I stand next to God, to man I'm no equal
Man of respect, man of the people
I stand next to God, to man I'm no equal

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ain't no breaking me down, bitch I'm breaking the banks
And ain't no holding me down, even if you holding the shanks
I'm controlling the time, nigga thinking some things
Got the heart of a lion, and I'm as strong as a tank
Sittin' on my throne and my crown, can't separate me from that
I'm king of all I survey, God say be patient for that
Man all I got is my gangster, better not go playing with that
Anything get taken from us, my folk, we takin' it back
Bet we go take us some lives 'fore we go take it to law
Boy I got fire in my eyes, look at me see gauges go off
Watch how you come at your fate, nigga better be saving your thoughts
Boy all you got is a cape, I make the nation go off
And nigga who put fear in your heart? Respect me
Take an act of God 'fore a nigga check me
On his P's and Q's what a nigga best be
Who you got your money on? Bet me, let's see
Who the people want

[Hook: Pharrell]
When they see you, they might judge you
Give you side eyes, they don't trust you
Misunderstand you, call you trouble
I understand you, it's just a hustle
Just keep stirin' it, let it bubble
You're my brother, I'm not above you
Remember me I'm so there
Don't make us have to go there
Turn and sing it

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I stay silent with red even if I'm standing with blue
When your request is denied, bet my demand'll get through
They may be killers to you, hey they my family dude
And anybody could get it, bitch but especially you
These nigga pressin' me, testin', what you suggestin' we do?
And wait a second, push your pawn to play chess with these dude
Yeah we could jump 'em and check em by sprayin' tecs at these fools
Make it to trial, you don't win, indirectly you lose
Your bet make yo next move, your best move
Or end up in the pen like the next dude
Remember, there's very few like you they let through
They even fewer, they didn't want in there, they get through
To get to the level you on, hard to do homes
More nigga do a lot of right, right before they do wrong
And you gone, out of there, nigga see you later
'Less you beat 'em a year later, Boosie tell 'em
Who the people want

[Hook]
When they see you, they might judge you
Give you side eyes, they don't trust you
Misunderstand you, call you trouble
I understand you, it's just a hustle
Just keep stirin' it, let it bubble
You're my brother, I'm not above you
Remember me I'm so there
Don't make us have to go there
Turn and sing it

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Get T.I. in the Chi, handshake it with 5
Still politicin' with 6 pimp I'm as real as it gets
And bitch I would never be hit with by intellectual weaponry
Ain't no one gon' disrespect me, or compromise my integrity
Say what my pedigree? Solid, gats you talkin' bout, I shot it
Bet you never been to war like I ain't never been to college
C'mon, fuck what you tellin' me, them lies, chill with 'em
I know folk from where you from, spent months in jail with 'em
Said you coded took a plea, he ain't tell but you woulda
Let them sucka niggas rob you, they ain't kill you but they shoulda
And a robbery for me is like a suicide mission
Suicide, you should commit it, save a G a life sentence
I swear, you and me ain't even fit to compare
I ain't make it all these years on a wing and a prayer
Stare in a bigger nigga eye while he standing right there
Got a problem I'ma handle it right there
Who the people want

[Hook]
When they see you, they might judge you
Give you side eyes, they don't trust you
Misunderstand you, call you trouble
I understand you, it's just a hustle
Just keep stirin' it, let it bubble
You're my brother, I'm not above you
Remember me I'm so there
Don't make us have to go there
Turn and sing it

[Intro: Sample]
Take it off, chick, bend over, let me see it
Le-le-let me see it, bend over, let me see it, see it
Take it off, chick, bend over, let me see it
Le-le-let me see it, let me see it, take it off

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Girl, take it off for me, you know just what I want
It's always hard to leave, this private show
Let me see you, see you, let me see you take it off, off
Let me see you take it off, off
Take it off, let me
Let me see you take it off, take it off

[Verse 1: T.I.]
(Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Hey, shawty let me see you take it off, toot it up
Back into me, pass it to me
Imagine hanging halfway off the mattress
While your ass is moving
Up and down, back and forth, so ratchet when you 'posed to be
A lady to the naked eye but a nasty lil ho to me
If only the masses could see your ass when it's in action, I swear (I swear)
Manhandle you in public places, I make you take it right here
You got no idea (idea), listen, girl, with this pole right here, ow
Beat it up, be grabbing hair, leaving hand prints on your derrière (yeah)
Now can you just kiss it for me
While I'm doing 'bout a hundred on the highway?
Get it sloppy wet, get it bent
Girl, I bet you could finish before I pull up on the driveway
And this ain't no child play
This grown man B.I., girl, I'll say
I got your ass in the scope, ain't gotta be close, shawty
I could hit your pussy from a mile away, ayy

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Girl, take it off for me, you know just what I want
It's always hard to leave, this private show
Let me see you, see you, let me see you take it off, off
Let me see you take it off, off
Take it off, let me
Let me see you take it off, take it off

[Verse 2: T.I.]
(Ayy, let me see it, for real)
Hey, let me see you take it off, lay it down
Like this my last day in town
I'm putting in work, no playing 'round
But shawty, I'm saying, now
Me let you walk away without walking funny
Be talking 'bout me, I highly doubt it
So, let me take you to a private island
Make you take this dick, don't cry about it
How it feel to you, girl? Don't lie about it
No, shawty, you ain't gotta lie about it
Blacking out in that pussy like a power outage
Got a man, well he gonna be sour 'bout it
But I just wanna be on your team
Provide you with your protein
Leave wet dreams all in your face
Them tattoos all over your waist
Got me rock solid, come touch that
I'm fucking you like I'm upset
Choking you, long stroking you
Say you came twice, not enough yet
Because a cat that fat is very rare
And my dick ought to be buried there
I love how you kick it in public
But in private, we on some wild shit (hahaha)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Girl, take it off for me, you know just what I want
It's always hard to leave, this private show
Let me see you, see you, let me see you take it off, off
Let me see you take it off, off
Take it off, let me
Let me see you take it off, take it off

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Made a reservation, you're my favorite place to be
All day, contemplating, baby, waiting patiently
There's no body like your body when you climb on top of me
We're in hell and lady, you're the closest thing to heavenly
I want you all to myself
Nothing at all, I can't help it
'Cause what you got on is fly as hell, but I need a better view
Just show me the real you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Girl, take it off for me (take it off), you know just what I want (I want)
It's always hard to leave (it's hard, it's hard, it's hard), this private show (yeah, let me)
Let me see you, see you, let me see you take it off, off
Let me see you take it off, off
Take it off, let me
Let me see you take it off, take it off

[Intro]
You know, may no man, woman, child, nor animal
Walk a lifetime on God green Earth and not expect to be tested
Just observe and acknowledge when the occasion is risen to by champions
You know what I'm sayin'?
Let this speak for itself and handle me accordingly
When you see me nigga, it ain't no secret, you know what's happenin'
No fake, no flaw, man. Straight like that. It's the king, bitch

[Hook: Sample]
You lay it down, lay it down, you lay it down (tell em what)
I'm a king
Make no mistake of it, nigga, real as it get
A1 for day one accept no substitution

[Verse 1]
Play around if you want and get hammered, leave you on your dick
I come from Atlanta, the '80s and '90s but we was as real as it gets
And that's why we still here
You best watch what you say, you could pay with your life tonight
Fuck around and get killed
As I pray to the Lord, tell him if I should die tonight
First let me put up a mil'
Inside of the hands of one of the men
Who's gonna go kill or go to the pen
If ever should blood out my body may spill
The nigga, their partner, their family, they're killed
I'm talkin' for real, you kickin' that rah-rah to me
I LOL, shit's haha to me
Nigga ever disrespect, I wave bye bye to him
Got a Maybach, it's just like a Mazda to him
Chew him up like the mouth in the teeth
Or you drop to beneath the belly of the beast
Geesh, call me the chief
The capo, capisce? Got the streets on a leash
The way that I walk it, exactly the way that I talk it
One took a hit and he rest in a coffin
Forever for all of that shit he was talkin'
You go against me, what you better do, shawty, is

[Hook]
You lay it down, lay it down, you lay it down (tell em what homie)
I'm a king
(Real talk, its the king bitch turn it)
You lay it down, lay it down, you lay it down (tell em doug)
I'm a king

[Verse 2]
Despicable me, I'm no typical G, got your bitch on her knees
When I skeet in her tree
Only came in here for what I wanted and shit that I don't
If you have it, you keep
I'm so diabolical, dick hard enough to cut molecules
You say she wifey, I say she a party girl
Type to eat bitches out when she on molly
You'll never know, which is to me that shit's obvious
She say you're pitiful, they think you're popular
That ain't gon' keep my lil' partner from poppin' yah
Take it, you droppin', you cement your bottle
So won't be no poppin' up, body's erased
No weapon, no charge, no witness, no questions
No stressin', no body, no case
Errbody okay, I will off that guy with my chopper, I throw it away
You can just buy me a cake
And most of the niggas you see standin' by me today
Were trappin' with me in the A
And down here we always three bitches, Rodeo, LA
And killers who do what we say
This could be the end of you today
My gunner run into you today
Here's what I suggest you do when they spray

[Hook]
You lay it down, lay it down, you lay it down
I'm a king
Yeah nigga the strong way nothing wrong way nigga
It's the king bitch, aha
Turn it, turn it
Turn it, turn it
Turn it, turn it
Turn it, turn it
Turn it, turn it

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I'm a rich nigga like I don't know
I can change if I wanna, but I won't though
Steer right even when I'm on the wrong road
Real talk from the heart what I'm known for
Skinny jeans, I don't do those
I'm the starter sub-par oughta shoot for
Fully automatic chopper, you could shoot though
Now I'm movin' five mil' when I shoot dough
Audemar, Hublot
One point five on the two-do'
Old hustle, new flow
Old money, new ho
Suckers prayin' I'ma chill, but I'm too cold
Long as I'm around, fuck they need you for?
Ridin' in the Chevy totin' three bricks
Since nobody wanna make G shit

[Hook: Watch The Duck]
This is for the gangsters, for the pimps and hoes
This is for the dope boy trappers sellin' halves and hoes
(Since nobody wanna make G shit)
They want G shit, give it to 'em, give it to 'em now
They want G shit, give it to 'em, I'm the one to give it to 'em

[Verse 2: T.I.]
If you don't know me let me tell you somethin', shawty
Still got them choppers, make you run from it
Camouflage, dog tag
Got 'em followin', when you see me better haul ass
Keep it G at all costs, what you call that?
Crack rock, hip hop, I done all that
Certified trap nigga, sucker, fall back
A broke nigga he may entertain all that
All left field, keep it true, nigga
Save the flash in the dance for a new nigga
Keep speakin' for the ones who ain't got a voice
Kill 'em dead only when they leave no other choice
How I see it, if you ain't down to die 'bout it
Don't waste my time, slime, why the fuck we talking about it?
Still ridin' in the Chevy totin' three bricks
Since nobody wanna make G shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
Now what the fuck is an ounce? We smokin' bout an LB
We don't even do the nine, sell it by the whole ki
And I'ma take this shit to trial, they got nothin' on me
They be on the Champagne, bitch, I'm 'bout to OD
I got a bag full of birds and motherfuckers gettin' bought
Bars on the trap doors got it looking like a vault
Used to hit the highway over twenty of them things
Young nigga hit the club with the twenty of them chains
When Jay was beefin' with Nas, I was sellin' cocaine
When Game was beefin' with 50, I was doin' the same thing
I was at the hospital, nigga, Meechy got shot
Fuck you niggas talking 'bout? I love that nigga like Pac
G shit

[Hook]

[Intro: T.I.]
Search far and wide
And I bet you'll never find a lil' nigga with a heart this size
Keep me separate and apart from all the frauds
They see me get appalled, you know why?

[Chorus: Victoria Monet]
I'm about my issue, babe
And you can tell by my name, yeah
I'm about my issue, babe
Whatever stands in my way, yeah
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ayy, ayy
Every time I take penitentiary chance all I say
God with me, I'ma find my way
Nigga, they ain't even fuck around nowaday
Feds came in the house, say they found my yay
A couple handguns and a new SK
Bag full of weed and some Grand Marnier
But fuck it though, I gotta keep my grandma straight
Catch a case, getaway by the grace of God
Standin' on the corner slangin' slabs of hard
Just a young soldier, no camouflage
Man, them niggas ain't tough, they're just playing hard
I pull a fuck nigga card on GP
Between 'em make 11 mill and peewee
We spray your block, turn around, pull up, repeat
And laugh 'bout it, lookin' at it on TV
Man, I'm certified in my gangster
Hittin' on the ride like my banger
I'm in the gated mansion, no neighbor
New Italian suits on my hangers
I got Cuban links and diamond rings
Solitaires and shiny things
Ayy, fuck how tough you tryna seem
Come try the king, 'cause I'm about my

[Chorus: Victoria Monet]
I'm about my issue, babe
And you can tell by my name, yeah
I'm about my issue, babe
Whatever stands in my way, yeah
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Ayy
Have you ever heard the point blank blast of a Mossberg?
Whole block never mind like it's not heard
Lil' nigga keep it movin' like they not scared
And out here, it's do or die
Kill or be killed, in the coupe so fly
Man, the niggas over there tried to shoot your guy
Man, the fully automatic .22 go by like, "Damn"
And as fly as I am, it's hard for you to tell how high I am, huhn
Oh my, God damn, you see it don't believe it still
And all I ever had was a Glock 23 and an extra mag
Presidential weed and a extra bag
Two or three bad bitches on the jet to France
We set to land and I get to the plan how to violate your little sexy ass
Then get in the Jag, the little Vette crash
Just ride this till you get to splash
You a wild girl, go cowgirl
Keep the noise down, you loud girl
Turn down, don't know how girl
No white girl 'cause

[Chorus: Victoria Monet]
I'm about my issue, babe
And you can tell by my name, yeah
I'm about my issue, babe
Whatever stands in my way, yeah
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Yuh, look
Couldn't listen to niggas they said I dream too much
Heart fucked up, guess I seen too much
Numb to it now, bring a gun to it now
When this shit pop, I'ma run to it now
Niggas talk loud but they dumb to announce
Barely got away so you tryna play it down
When they kick down your door and they run through your house
Cuffs on your wrists and they cussin' you out
It'll make sense then, tellin' you that they got your prints then
What's the reward for your risk then?
Niggas game goofy, this just in
Time after time, don't be needin' a light, nigga, blind lead the blind
Why do we ride? Grind to provide, nigga, not just to shine
Blood in my eyes, stress on my mind, let a fly nigga fly
Nine on my side, God, I'm your child but times are so wild
Playin' with me, I'ma draw down and I'ma show out
If it gotta go down, I'm prepared to go now 'cause

[Chorus: Victoria Monet]
I'm about my issue, babe
And you can tell by my name, yeah
I'm about my issue, babe
Whatever stands in my way, yeah
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da
(Verse 1: Gucci Mane)
I'm so fucking dumb, I wrote diamonds on my thumb
I got a diamond on my dick, so thats a diamond on her tongue
I can't feel you baby, cause I'm romanticly numb
Emotionally drained, I came here just so i could cum
Theres nothing under Gods sun, that I haven't done
I got a lot of problems, gettin pussy just isn't one
Girls are like buses, every fifteen minutes they run
Now their like potato chips, I just can not have one
And I might like you for a minute
But I dont like yo friends in my business
And I feel like you deserve a Benzy
Cause you wasn't in the kitchen with me, water whippin

[Chorus: Drake]
Uh uhh uhhhhh, I know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you probably tell that shit to everybody
So we hear you talkin boo but we just don't believe you

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, okay I'm all about it, all for it
I'm all star team Jordan, small forward
I'm never puttin up a shot unless it calls for it
No hesitations, so I'm shooting if I draw for it
Pow pow, Fuck is up, now I'm up in this hoe
Life is moving fast, where the fuck do all this minutes go
Mixtape dropped, then I started gettin ten a show
Now I get a hundred, what the fuck you think I'm in it for
Young money forever, I bet Gudda, J, and Mack agree
Fuck you to the haters that just spend they time attackin me
Shoutout to you're girlfriend nigga, lately she been distractin me
Wondering if im the best, well I ain't no blaceyedpeace
Girls wanna fuck and niggas gotta wanna be you
Line'n up around the block, so they can get to see you
I feel like I find a wife exactly when I need to
So you can say whatever girl but we just dont believe you

[Chorus: Drake]
Uhuuuuuh I know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you probably say that shit to everybody so we hear you talkin boo but we just dont believe you

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I'm strapped up, nigga fuck a gun law

I don't do no arguin', I let the gun talk
Yah! I'm strapped up, nigga fuck a gun law

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, fuck that nigga, ho ass nigga

Run up in ya house, where the dope at, nigga?
Murder she wrote on a notepad, nigga
Light that nigga up, smoke that nigga
Stomp that nigga, roast that nigga
I'm walkin' 'round with this shotgun and this bitch bigger than me nigga
Don't open up yo fuckin' mouth cause I'll pull the trigger like teeth nigga
Shoot 'em up, then leave, nigga

[Hook]

And it's no talkin' back when my gun talk

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Keep that ho shit over there
And we don't shoot in the air
I can't fuck with these niggas, man these niggas gummy bears
Hair trigger on the gun, I pull that muthafucka' hair
It's like man you can't trust nobody, I don't even have a trust fund
Don't buck, nigga, don't stunt, nigga
Don't duck, nigga cause I duck hunt
Bitch rock with me, that Glock with me
That chopper with me, obviously
I'mma empty this muthafucka' - that's fifty shots, approximately
Now fuck with me, get fucked over
Emergency room: rushed over
Hollow tips, in the clip, my gun loaded: yours sober
I pull yo card like a lawn mower
Fall back or I'm goin' forward
I see you got yo gun drawn; I send you back to the drawin' board
Lil Tunechi

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk

See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
That's my gun walk, nigga that's my gun walk

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Walkin' round this mu'fucka limpin'
Cause the nose on the pistol 'bout as long as Scottie Pippen's
On the molly and I'm twisted
Throw ya body with the fishes
Double back around that corner and I'm bodying the witness
Uh, real niggas don't talk much
Do drive by's and walk ups
Lame rappers that talk tough get a broke jaw, star struck
I don't fuck with the lame niggas
I got good aim, nigga
Pop a pill, pop you, my nick name is Pain Killer
I'm still that same nigga, Eastside I rep that
Pussy niggas better get right or where I see you, you get left at
Use the rifle as my crutch, that's my gun walk
Or we can hold a conversation, let the guns talk
Gudda!

[Bridge: Juicy J]
I'm strapped up, nigga fuck a gun law

[Intro: Mark Wahlberg, Tyga]
Due to some violent content, parental discretion is advised
Wanna be a monument to physical perfection?
You wanna be a shrine? You should be
You wanted change, right?
All you gotta change is that fanny pack, is that what you want? Ah

[Chorus]
I don't wan' be famous (I don't wan' be famous)
Uh, I just wan' be rich
40 mill' with some acres (40 mill' with some acres)
Uh, makeup for my bitch (Ha)

Uh, stop pretending and shit (Ah)
I don't wan' be famous (I don't wan' be famous)
Nah, I just wan' be rich (Rich)

[Verse 1]
I don't wan' be famous
Fuck around, be a Lennon and a fan, leave you brainless
All in the paper, gettin' buried by a neighbor
While your relatives spendin' all the money that you gave 'em
Fuck it, don't save 'em
Let that boy drown if he don't float, guess he wasn't made for it
My nigga hold it, hold it down
Listenin' to underground
Poppin' uppers 'cause these niggas wanna bring me down
Put your face in the dirt like fourth down
Niggas wan' test, but we'll never fail
I'm layin' low in my day clothes
Can't get a fuckin' meal at Pollo Loco without taking photos
Man, these lil' crazy niggas loco

[Chorus]
I don't wan' be famous (I don't wan' be famous)
Uh, I just wan' be rich
40 mill' with some acres (40 mill' with some acres)

Uh, stop pretending and shit

Nah, I just wan' be rich

[Verse 2]
I don't wan' be famous
Flip a finger, middle finger, let 'em know that I'm dangerous (Baow)
All my niggas bangers, Chevy riding swingers
And my bitch'll fight ya, Hilary Swank ya
Take your bitch, we ain't even swingers
Nigga, try your luck, think it's all entertainment
You all in arraignment, snitchin' to the plaintiff
Who, what, where? My niggas stay nameless (My niggas stay nameless)
Ah, knock down your door for that dough
My niggas, they go when I say "Go"
These bitches fuckin' 'cause they hoes (Yeah)
They hoes for that muhfuckin' fame

[Chorus]
I don't wan' be famous (I don't wan' be famous)
Uh, I just wan' be rich

Nah, I just wan' be rich

[Bridge]
We don't fuck wit' you, we don't fuck wit' you (We don't fuck wit' you)
I don't need the proof
We don't fuck with you, we don't fuck with you (We don't fuck wit' you)
Nigga, that's the proof
Niggas talkin', that's bulletproof (That's bulletproof)
Run and shoot
Niggas talkin' like they bulletproof
My niggas, they run and shoot

[Outro: Mark Wahlberg]
We love those big bitches
And they love to eat, it's okay, that's important
This being broke shit's gotta stop, man

[Verse 1]
Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said

[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

[Verse 2]
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls

[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York (New York), it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

[Bridge]
Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything

[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
Welcome to New York (New soundtrack)
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
The lights are so bright but they never blind me
Welcome to New York
So bright, they never blind me
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Ha, what ya got? (x4)

[Verse 1: Threat:]
It get hectic livin' life as a suspect
Ferocious out there, wild as a grizzly bear
Yo girl on a mission tryna jack ol boy for the cash
Two ski masks, strapped, where the yay at?
Ain't nothin' nice about the criminal life
Knives and guns and the chains and the teens in gangs
That done dropped outta school, he too cool
To read a book, see nook, crooks wind up on the news
The earth rattle, the over contaminated cattle
The enemies sail across seas to do battle
I know, I used to do those, now I'm retired
I desire not to have my soul burn fire
Everybody got a nickname and they clique bang
Rumble you can hear it through the concrete jungle
I spit it so well cause I see it all day
Homemade, pushin' sledge, spittin' gettin' that
Ladies say hey come close, I don't bite
I go to class durin' the day and I work at night
I go where I want and I do what I like
I'm pursuin' doin' plumbin', layin' down pipes (that's right)

[Hook (x2): Snoop Dogg]
A million things run through my mind
And you ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Time brings change and change brings time
Just sit back and listen let me hit you wit a line
That I wrote and I quote that it's dope from the top
Please don't you quit, oh Snoop can't stop
I rock non stop when I have that mic
I give you motherfuckers just what ya like
You can bounce, you can pop, but just don't stop
Cause when I take the mic I plan to make your body rock
And don't you quit and don't you spit nothing to me
Cause you can't do me, why you talkin' madness you handed
Your microphone to your mouth now
You couldn't spit nothin' couldn't even turn it out, dumb ass
You got jealous and the fellas got mad at you
You couldn't do what the L.B.C. Crew do
You couldn't do what the D.P.G. niggas do
And you damn sure can't do what the L.A. zoo do
Try to stay true and try to get wit this
Niggas since Dogg was on the mic I'm too sick wit this
And when I come with some, boy I'm so ridiculous
Now shut the fuck up and listen while I'm kickin' this

[Hook (x2): Snoop Dogg]
A million things run through my mind
And you ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time

[Verse 3: Threat]
Killin' up crews give 'em the real street blues
Have 'em slidin' in they eel skins, groovin' in they tennis shoes
Of course I don't stop, being a west side rider
Wit no tattoos, that's how they got you
I make conversations on rappers CD's
And B.G.s and originals listen for the mission
Behind the wall, raise the shot call
Aimin' at the liberty blastin' artillery
My mental mind state is to build and create
And to weed out suckers, cremate motherfuckers
Mail through, put it down on your whole military
Pen ink scary like death at 13ths

[Snoop Dogg:]
So all you alley cats get your eyes off the trash
And beware the bow wow cause I'm bitin' at your ass
And got you barkin' at the wrong tree, nigga
Can't you see we got the whole game locked like the penitentiary, nigga

[Hook x3]

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
What you watchin' the clock for?
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin', slippin', slippin'...
Me and my niggas just keep on dippin'...
But I ain't set trippin'
Yeah... Throwin' down y'all
They fucked around and let some dogs in the zoo
I've never seen a dog at a zoo
True...
Oh yeah, west coast
(We are party people, Dogg Pound Gangstas are party people)
Yeah, Yeah

[Hook: Usher]
Usher, baby
Don't be bullshitin' with me
I don't care if you've got a boyfriend or not, girl
It's at ya own risk if you're kicking with me
'Fore it be over you be spending the night, girl
I can see, you look like you're ready to ride
And girl obviously, it's been true, ooh you wanna give it to me

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ridin' off in Hollywood
Kicking it with hotter bitches, all they get's a lot of wood
Give it to 'em hardcore, all they do is holla good
Her ex, he be soft strokin', I lean in it follow through it
She's so sexy, her complexion say she from Bollywood
In my section, I wonder will a thousand dollar do it
If not a fifty or a hundred, still I gotta do it
You surely would, if you were me then for sure you could
Get her and her partner out that Honda
Have 'em both fuckin' and suckin' til mañana
Heard nigga you with baby he don't want no problem
If your man ain't a killer, what the fuck I care about him
No comparison ain't nothin' rare about him
Witness saying he was just standing there and then they shot him
Trigger got no heart when that thing squeeze
Or they catch a body to make you my main squeeze, yeah

[Hook: Usher]
Don't be bullshitin' with me
I don't care if you've got a boyfriend or not, girl
It's at ya own risk if you're kicking with me
'Fore it be over you be spending the night, girl
I can see, you look like you're ready to ride
And girl obviously, it's been true, ooh you wanna give it to me

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Raff triple black, Bentley matte white
She said she don't like girls, she did that night
They were taking turns, I was taking flights
In competition man them bitches hit that pipe
Going down on it
If it ain't a bad bitch then I don't want it, ain't no mediocre
Experiment with pretty bitches, that's the shit I told her
As long as they got pretty toes and they ain't got a odor
And showed her, how to stack paper, no foldin'
Colder than eskimo shoulders, you strong with it
I don't play too, four four for the vultures
Eat pussy Lord yes is she looking gorgeous
And you're just a lot of talk
Them three got on the molly then the four of us, we got it off
And they ain't get paid like they playing college ball
Go out, receive a cock and balls, bullshit me, not at all

[Hook: Usher]
Don't be bullshitin' with me
I don't care if you've got a boyfriend or not, girl
It's at ya own risk if you're kicking with me
'Fore it be over you be spending the night, girl
I can see, you look like you're ready to ride
And girl obviously, it's been true, ooh you wanna give it to me

[Verse 3: Usher]
Quit all playing with me
I know you got a nigga he just gon' be mad at me
So if you love him, think he's special, don't come home with me
Cause when I get you to my crib you gon' belong to me
I understand if you don't wanna go
Just know what's gon' happen once we get through the door
Promising you something you ain't never seen before
Say you with me, if you down, I ain't tellin' nobody

[Outro: Usher]
So tell me what you gon' do
When you ready you can fall through
You can bring a friend too
Say you with me, if you down, I ain't tellin' nobody
So tell me what you gon' do
When you ready you can fall through
You can bring a friend too
Say you with me, if you down

[Intro]
I remember, I remember
I remember, I remember
I remember, I remember
I remember

[Part 1]
Back before the record deal and the cars
And the cribs and the way that things took off
I was signing at Lucy's on 1-25th, just tryin' my best to get on
Back when me and Puff and B.I.G. was kids and I knew Jodeci
I was young and tough and fresh in love and it was all a dream
Signing a contract, no guiding light, just hopin' I
I can get out the projects
And get my family right cause they were my life
In Red Zones, in Bentley's, you can catch me, tryna do me
I was jaded on the block, I coulda faded on the block
But I made it off the block and I

[Hook]
I remember, back when I didn't know which way to feel
I remember, back when pain was all I had to give
The reflections of my life, I see the lessons that I've learned
And now I know, heartbreak don't exist when it's been torn apart by love

[Part 2]
I use to throw a fit, I use to shed a doubt
And blame it on a man but that was Mary than
And this is Mary now, you gotta understand
It's about how we respect ourselves
And the men have no control of our self-esteem
And when we see that then we can let go, oh

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Now I made some mistakes, I lost some friends along the way
But I don't carry it cause it made me a better chick
It's my life and I know that there's more for me to see
(So much more)
I may not be what I'm suppose to
But I can tell you right now, I ain't what I use to be

[Extended Hook]
(I remember) I remember when I didn't know which way to live
(I remember) I remember when pain was all I had to give
The reflections of my life, I see the lessons that I've learned
And now I know, heartbreak don't exist when it's been torn apart by love
(I remember)

I remember, I remember
(I remember) I remember, I remember
The reflections of my life, I see the lessons that I've learned
And now I know, heartbreak don't exist
When it's been torn apart by love, by love
(I remember)
Don't exist no more
(I remember) But I remember, I remember
(I remember) I remember, I remember
(I remember) I remember

I remember

[Intro: T.I.]

Sucka ass nigga, heh, uh-huh

[Verse 1: T.I.]

And I don't dig y'all niggas, so stop callin me
This ain't a peace sign bitch, it mean two to ya head
You know I'm quick to hit ya patna

Still reppin A-Town nigga, Center Hill what's up?

You know my nigga quick to hit a nigga chick
Quick to hit a lick, quick to run a check up
Dope boy, we the best of niggas
Raise techs up nigga, try to check us, try me
I'ma bust his head quick fast, Ricky Bobby
Ask his patna what the fuck he wanna do about it? Nada
Hustle Gang bang green, all about a dollar
Better hold her hand if you give a shit about her
When you bring her round me, all I know
I'ma get some head right before I go
Gotta problem, we can handle this shit off top
Got the thing let it pop, cool as a cough drop
100 on the watch ball and a decade in
None of my niggas fightin less the rest came in
Was a trial defendent sitting 'til the check came in
100 of them 21, run it, do it again
I ain't got no co-defendent just my family and friends
And a trunk full of chopper rifles, handles and pins
Loaded down in an old brown Buick sedan
Lookin for it on the way to Alabama again

[Hook T.I.]
On everything I love, nigga put it on something

[Verse 2: Trae The Truth]
King of the streets, graduated from the bottom
All red whip looking like somebody shot em
Still up in the hood with a sack and a pack
40 cal fully loaded, never leaving here without him
Real niggas exctinct, feelin like somebody got em

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Run up on a nigga what it hittin for?
Point blank, left his brain on the window
Had the chain, had a stain on my timbos
Insane in the brain, gon mental
Catch me riding round in a Range Rover rental
With some bad bitches wanna chill like a mento
Now heres a mental memento you didn't know
You can fit a bird times 12 in Sorentos (you can)
Kill, go to Jacksonville
Drop it on they ass like I did't have a deal
Still in the trap, keep it real like Madea
100 rounds and they runnin ain't hard you can tell (yuh aye)
All you gotta do is see my garage and look at theirs (whoa)
Look at mine and look at theres now wait my nigga (wait my nigga)
It will be yo ass when you hate my nigga
If you go against me you against a great my nigga
Like Great White Great ape my nigga
We can run the moss all in your face my nigga
Have ya partner like "God who done ate my nigga?"
Bring the drama to your momma, how? With eight, nine niggas
In a line, I ain't lyin, I'm a lion

On the block walk around with a little Glock 9
And the preacher Fin put it on a motherfucka mind, I ain't lyin

[Spoken Outro]

[Produced by Ben Billions]

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I usually love sleeping all alone
This time around bring your friend with you
But we ain't really going to sleep at all
You ain't gonna catch me with them sneak pictures
In my city I'm a young god
That pussy kill be so vicious
My god white, he in my pocket
He get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
She asked me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often

[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q]
Often, often, girl I do this often
In that thing, switch lane to lane, look like I spent a fortune
Awesome, 100 plus, can't get this from the auction
Need a chick to ride my dick and back it up like parking
Show that pussy, work that pussy
Who that pussy, that's my pussy
Wet that pussy, stroke that pussy
Ooh! I twist the weed
You on your phone texting your friend to come fuck
I wonder if it's the druggies wit hoes or the millions of bucks
But, ask me if I do this everyday you know
I'm ballin', make 80k straight off the plane you know
Trade my grill in for the Bentley or the Range you know
I'm in the studio just tryna get some brains you know

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
She asked me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Freakier than freaky, when she climax she make pee pee
Step back like a player, turn my cheek she try to reach me
What you in this for? Another sucker for a whore
Never I, tailored by my new young Anna Wintour
Centerfold attraction, sexual compassion
Often memories are faded, these are everlastin'
Long eyelashes, palmin' her every asset
Often imitated because this life I live is lavish
Bud like a flower, Miami's new Eiffel Tower
Love in the dark to the beat of my heart
She came from the ghetto and now her closet is Neiman
Often the results of the women joinin' my team and dreamin'

[Bridge]
Oooh, the sun's risin' up
The night's almost up
The night's almost done
But I see your eyes
You wanna go again
Girl, I'll go again
Girl, I'll go again

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
She asked me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often

[Intro: Pitbull]
Hey Gentlemen, haha
It's like these boys wanna make music for the block
You know, for they hood, for they city, haha

[Bridge: B.o.B & (Pitbull)]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(I'm tryna make music for the world)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(You feel me, right, B.o.B?)
Oh-oh
(This one we came up with)

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I got up today
And my flight was late
On my way to L.A
I jumped up on a plane
And put on my shades
And threw on my headphones
I was vibin' to this beat
That made me move my feet
Boy, that thang was sticky
And then I heard this (Melody)
The dopest one I've ever seen
Something out the usual
So Mr. Pilot, please
I think I got a hit on me
Hurry to the studio (Studio)

[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'll play across the world
Across the world, across the world
I'll play across the world
Across the world, across the world
I'll play across the world
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Well, I got up today (Today)
Put some gas in my tank (Tank)
To make it to the studio (Studio)
And then I heard this beat (Beat)
It made me move my feet (My feet)
Hell yeah, that thing was super dope
(Yeah, that thing was super dope)
And then I sang this (Melody)
The dopest one I've ever seen
Something out the usual
So Mr. Engineer
Turn up the auto-tune
So I'll be on the radio (Radio)

[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'll play across the world
Across the world, across the world
I'll play across the world
Across the world, across the world
I'll play across the world
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Been around the world, same old songs
Now on stage after bras and thongs
Long way from what I came from
Fighting in the club for just singing a song
Now my passport's full, I'm outta pages
New places, new faces
New fans, all ages
Black, pink, purple, orange, caucasians
Latino's, European's and Asian's
In Japan, they knew all my lyrics, it was amazing
They spoke Spanish
Que ma carne, ni ma carne, asi viene el sandwich
I guess it's true what they say
Music is the universal language
Its a true blessing, you know
To travel the globe

[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'll play across the world
Across the world, across the world
I'll play across the world
Across the world, across the world
I'll play across the world

Oh in and out of town

You ready?
Look I been in and out town
Still making plays even when I'm out of bounds
Automatic champagne poppin', never out of rounds
Tell me where the throne at, that's where I be sitting down
I run up in your city, run a spot, run a town
Bet I run that motherfucker even when I'm not around
Only time to fuck, not to fuck around
I got weed, bad bitches, and money and they all a hundred pounds
God damn, I am (for pot pans), turn that shit straight to hot sand
Yea I got the blue print, these niggas tryna' trace
They tell me slow down but I'm in the human race
And I be damn if I ain't first, never living in reverse
I just hit it from reverse, swear that shit so crazy
Man L.A girls so crazy, how's it sunny if them hoes there shady?
And New York bitches screaming fuck you pay me
In ATL they be eating all their gravy
And Detroit man them girls so gangsta'
In Philly, I seen some pretty faces
Look, I love it when she up and down the pole
Make me wanna' take your ass up and down in Khol's
Have you ever been in Napa where they champagne, sipped in
Fly across the border to the 4-1-6, then go up to Philly where they know this shit legit
One time for the hood, man you know that we the shit
Come through in the city and you know, East Philly and you know I'm reppin' Philly

Oh god damn, we should pop a wheelie

[Verse 2]
Dream Chasers, what up though?
It's that Finally Famous boy, we out here reppin'
Since day one, look
I got a lot on my mind, I got more on my face
If I ain't going to get it, that day is going to waste
I'm trying to move in my safe, like the safe was a safe house
I ain't going out to eat, but these hoes stay on a steak out
Oh you know it's official when I go bring in that (paper)
I'm looking through them magazines like this the girl I'm a take out
One time for Detroit, yea you know that's what stay out
Man you know, plotin' up in there man to find a way way out
Find a way way out, we had to fire our way way out

I came from the dirt up and did it ya heard up
Hoes say I'm the man, 'uh huh I concur it
I'm young and perverted
If I don't get the pussy or the payment what the fuck is the purpose
No calling' my phone unless you the fam or my girl

[Cosmic Kev]
Hold up, we about to switch it off

[Sean]
I was just finna go off.. Quill what up tho

[Verse 3]
Live life
Get High
Change the world, man do it all before you go
In Europe riding European so it's not a foreign though
They like "Show me the Moves", no time for a tutorial
There's levels to the game like "who put this shit on story mode"
His story; historical
Mister Anderson, I know Sway ain't got the answers so I'm looking for the oracle
All my favorite rappers told me "Life's a bitch"
So I'mma fuck the world through the glory hole
So that bitch can't take me to the Maury show
If she don't smoke weed, pop pills, suck d***
If there's one thing that I hate, man it's boring hoes
All my girls love me, so if I die today it'll be like 5,011 somethin' freaks at the memorial, ya bish
I hop up on the beat like it's the '08 me
When we was riding 4 deep boy no AC
Heading to the game for OK seats
Now I'm courtside at OKC
I know KD
And all these singer girls know me like 'Doe Rae Me'
Foh Sa Lah Tee Doe, but dope come first
No late fees
Kool-Aid smile
Colgate Teeth
The bigger that I get, the more I need shrinks
Woop Woop
Got a couple screws loose
You was in the winner's circle you just tryna get off in the fruit
Fruit Loop
Turned nothing into two, something into new
I could write a best seller out of Alphabet Soup

[Verse 4]
It Goes: Try Me, Try Me
I'mma get his whole mothafuckin' family
Look I ain't playin' with nobody
I come from 6 Mile, I ain't a cosby
Understand I came up nigga, yeah that's all me
The world is in my palm, mothafucka I need palm trees

Hol' Up, Hol'up
This is a special record ... I may need to go on this for real

[Instrumental Intro]

You've been faking it all this time
You left my trust on the firing line
As the promises break, the only mistakes
Giving you what was mine
Your words are clear but their meaning's gone
The notes are right but the tuning's wrong
And when you tell me again that I should give in
I can only take it so long, long, long, long

You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away, all away, all away!
You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away!

Fear is dancing inside your lies
Exposing secrets that you've disguised
And I'm biting my tongue as you become
Victim of a compromise
'Cause I know who you really are
Not a scratch where you pretend you're scarred
And it's time that you seek the truth without me
I can only get you so far, far, far, far
You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away, all away, all away!
You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away!

[Instrumental Break]

Throw it all away, all away, way!
Throw it all away, all away, all away, way!
Throw it all away, all away, all away, way!
Throw it all away, all away, all away, way!
Throw it all away, all a—!

You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away, all away, all away!
You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away, all away, all away!
You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away, all away, all away!
You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away!

[Intro]
Why is there suddenly a nigga trippin' when I do it?
Why do everybody else gon' have a war, have beef
Within the music, talkin' about differences and it's ok
It's music it's hip-hop it's groundbreaking
When I do it, it's war

[Verse 1: West West Cuh]
In the city watch how I'm getting head with it
She do it with no hands and I be ghost whippin'
Oops I think I meant ghost riding
When I get that vet watch how she let me slide in
In that pussy and you know I'm the livest
Introduced known to beat it up no crime man
And I might leave your bae crying
I'm so stressed out man all the homies fall in
And if she let me hit, the homies all can
And nigga if I'm eating it's all in one pan
'Cause I'mma be as hungry as the last man
A young 

[?] but I'm the nigga with the damn plan
I keep it G like a crip in the '80s
And man I beat your ass like a nigga in slavery
They say they're trying to help me but it sound like hate to me
A young nigga, but I'm wise like Dr. King
On my own shit, get your own ends
Niggas think they gettin' handouts 'cause we damn friends
Nigga put that spoon down better use your hands
Better get that grind right before you life ends
And I ain't never had no love for a fake friend
Or a fuck nigga, better duck nigga
Better hope one of them things don't get stuck in ya
(Bbbbla) good luck nigga

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Slip this with the crip stick
Itty bitty nigga with the slick shit
In a room full of misfits
Plug it in, let it bang, yea my shit bitch
Get bread like bisquick
You're a soft ass nigga with a face full of lipstick
Let me show you how a crip dip
Get ships and flips and take low trips
I sipps that shit ain't talking 'bout lean
Down to Mississippi and New Orleans
Word as a motherfucka, let me verb that
Snoop Dogg is a hog, yea I heard that
You deserve that swerve that 'lac
Make it bang, let it go, bring that back
I blew they brain, nephew yea do that thang

[Verse 3: Spanky Danky]
Living life in the maze it's amazing
So high I can levitate it's crazy
I feel like I'm the nigga in the matrix
I'm sipping codeine I feel like I'mma patient
I stay dosed down off a medical blunt this ain't new
Cop a qp I blow it with lil Snoop
Blowing smoke out the roof, hoes know we the truth
Get the bitch loose than I make her do what it do
Put the hole on the crew, word to 

[MC Duce?]
I'm chopping real game, other niggas is goose
And when I pass by the bitch she gon' know we the truth

[HE?] gang green and we're devoted to you
We brought base in your face to proof
The realest nigga out bitch give me the juice
They never hate a nigga when he spittin' the truth
I gotta keep it real gotta stick to my roots

[Verse 4: West West Cuh]
Tu-Tune in, you know my slang
Me and my niggas doing our thing and we all gon' win
Fucking these models and fucking they friends
Got more hoes than Snoop and Prince
Pimpin' nigga, look at my hands
Gold rings on my fingers
Young nigga and I'm hella dangerous
Like a lethal injection, ballers on it
Yea that's me section, getting money
Yea that's the only objection
Chrome everywhere so I see my reflections
West West, hold it down for Texas
Yellow diamonds on my necklace
Pretty bitches getting naked
Young nigga living reckless
Like 21 guns for protection

[Verse 5: Spanky Danky]
Been done with that fast life
So it was on to the thug life
Ain't no bet, but I could never love my wife
Like I love my life I never love ya twice
I fell in love one night still lost in the days in a major way
I be blazed for days, like Johnny
Mobbing in the 

[?] lane, it's my hobby
We savvy, real nigga say savvy
Looking for them bitches take them at a track meet
Deep dig bandit she run into my canyon
Dabbin' blowing like a candle, savvy
Woodgrain whippin' in the valley
Real OG I'm nothing like my daddy
Few kids on the way I'm happy
Raw dog, and I'm learning with a passion
Ohh, didn't y'all go to school
I'm reachin' and preachin' and teachin' the youth
They all in my business I'm feeling like Snoop
But I'm more like Pac learn a life lesson but I might get shot
I'm spreading the message that's all that I got
We pray for progression and stick to the plot
I'm feeling like Yoda my knowledge is hot

[Outro]
I see myself changing the world
Because my thought patterns are so opposite of the norm
So I will have to change the world
Or I will have to be changed by the world

On her motherfucking forehead, but damn, my iPhone dead, shit

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Stand there like a ghost
Shaking from the rain, rain
She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane?"
Say it's been a long six months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
And then, you say

[Chorus]
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (Oh-oh, oh)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl

[Verse 2]
Remind her how it used to be, be, yeah-yeah
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
Tell her how you must have lost your mind, ooh-ooh
When you left her all alone
And never told her why, why

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's how it works
That's how you lost the girl
And now, you say

[Chorus]
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
And you know
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
That I don't want you to go, oh, oh

[Breakdown]
Remind me how it used to be
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And say you want me, yeah-yeah
And then you say

[Chorus]
I want you for worse or for better (Worse or for better)
I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I want you forever and ever (I would wait forever and ever)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (This is how it works)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (Get the girl)

And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Outro]
And that's how it works
That's how you got the girl

[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
"Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"
Ayy

[Verse 2]
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 3]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

[Verse 4]
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin' like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Bridge]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 1]
Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
A long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

[Chorus]
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

[Verse 2]
So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road (Mmm)
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat (Mmm, yeah)
I say, "I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl"
Some other girl
He says, "What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinking 'bout you and I"
I said, "I've been there too a few times"

[Chorus]
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
(A tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style (We never go, we never go)
We never go out of style

[Bridge]
Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah, just take me home
Oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh
(Out of style)

[Chorus]
Oh, you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down (And when we go)
We come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

[Intro]
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)

[Verse 1]
People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road

[Chorus]
(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand, then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was (Stay)

[Post-Chorus]
All you had to do was (Stay)
All you had to do was (Stay)
All you had to do was (Stay)
All you had to do was stay

[Verse 2]
Here you are now, calling me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces
Of the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye

[Chorus]
(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand, then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was (Stay)

[Post-Chorus]
All you had to do was (Stay)
All you had to do was (Stay)
All you had to do was (Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay)

[Bridge]
Let me remind you
This was what you wanted (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
You ended it
You were all I wanted (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
But not like this
Not like this
Not like this
Oh, all you had to do was...

[Chorus]
(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand, then
Why'd you want to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was...
(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand, then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy (All you had to do was stay)
All you had to do was (Stay)

[Post-Chorus]
All you had to do was (Stay) (Oh)
All you had to do was (Stay)
All you had to do was (Stay) (Ooh)
All you had to do was (Stay)
Ironically, I care about everything!

I had problems with glaucoma, but then I got high
Smelled the cannabis aroma, and I got high
Glaucoma getting better and I know why
Because I got high, because I got high, because I got high

I used to smoke cigarettes, but then I got high
Getting tired and call it quits, but them I got high
I'm playing basketball and jogging and I know why
Because I got high, because I got high, because I got high

I used to drink beer and wine, but then I got high
I woke up feeling fine, because I got high
My hangover's over and I know why
Because I got high, because I got high, because I got high

Anxiety attacks, but then I got high
I used to take Xanax, but then I got high
No more prescription pills and I know why
Because I got high, because I got high, because I got high
The state made revenue, because I got high
They built a school or two, because I got high
Now the state can fund drug treatment and I know why
Because I got high, because I got high, because I got high

No more criminal traps if it's legalised
I don't have to buy from gang bangers shooting craps, if it's legalised
I can advocate with Weedmaps and I know why
It's legalised, it's legalised, it's legalised

[Verse 1]
Oh yeah you guessed it
Finally Famous in this thing we finessin'
Cartier lenses on me, ain't no questions
In and out of town I ain't slept in
Weeks, you ready?
Look, I've been in and out of town
Still making plays even when I'm out of bounds
Automatic champagne popping never out of rounds
Tell me where the throne, that's where I be sitting down
I run up in your city, run the spot, run the town
Even run that motherfucker when I'm not around
Only time to fuck, not to fuck around
I got weed, bad bitches, and money and they all 100 pounds
God damn, I am, from pots/pans
Turn that shit straight to hot sand
Yeah I got the blueprint these niggas try and trace
They tell me slow down but I'm in the human race
And I be damned if I ain't first, never living in reverse
I just hit it from reverse, swear that shit so crazy
Man L.A. girls so crazy
How's it sunny if them hoes stay shady
And New York bitches screaming "Fuck you pay me."
In ATL they be eating all the gravy
In Detroit man those girls so gangster
In Philly I've seen some pretty faces
Look, I love it when she up and down the pole
Make me want to take your ass up and down the coast
Have you ever been Annapol where they champagne sipped
Then fly across the border to the 416
Then go up to Philly where they know that shit legit
One time for the hood man you know that we the shit
Come through in the city and you know I eat Philly
And you know I'm repping Philly man shoutout to Meek Milly
I be going in this bitch until I'm silly

[Verse 2]
Dreamchasers what up though?
It's that finally famous boy
You know we out here repping since day one
Look, I got a lot on my mind
I got more on my face
If I ain't going to get it
That day is going to waste
I'm trying to move in my safe
Like the safe was a safehouse
I ain't going out to eat but these hoes stay on the steakout
Oh you know it's official when I go bringing that Bape out
I'm looking through the magazines like this the girl I'm about to take out
One time for Detroit, yeah you know that's what stay out
Yeah you know plotting up in there to find a way way out
Find a way way out we had to fire way way out
Music been bumping man we just waiting to break out
This the player you've heard of
The young and assertive
I came from the dirt up and
Did the unheard of
Hoes say I'm the man, uh-huh I concur it
I'm young and perverted
If I don't get the pussy or the payment, what the fuck is the purpose?
No calling my phone unless you the fam or my girl I'll just say it's no service
Stay connected as cursive

[Verse 3]
Live life, get high, change the world
Man do it all before you go
In Europe riding Europeans so it's not a foreign O
They like show me the moves, no time for a tutorial
They're is levels to the game, like who put this shit on story mode?
His story historical
Mr. Anderson, I know Sway ain't got the answers so I'm looking for the oracle
All my favorite rappers told me life's a bitch
So I'mma fuck the world through the glory hole
So that bitch can't take me to the Maury show
If she don't smoke weed, pop pills, suck *Tss*
If it's one thing that I hate, man it's boring hoes
All my girls love me
So if I die today it be like 5,011 something freaks at the memorial
Lil bitch
I hop up on the beat like it's the 08 me
When we was riding for D boy no AC
Headed to the game for okay seats
Now it's courtside at OKC
I know KD
And all these singer girls know me like do-re-mi
Fa-so-la-ti-do but doe come first
No late fees
Kool-Aid smile, colgate teeth
The bigger that I get the more I need shrinks
Woop-woop got a couple screws loose
You was in the winner circle you just trying to get off in the fruit
Fruit Loop
Turn nothing into 2, something into new
I could write a best seller out of alphabet soup

[Verse 4]
Try me, try me
I'mma get this whole motherfucking family
Looking I ain't playing with nobody
I come from 6 mile boy I ain't a Cosby
Understand I came up nigga yeah that's all me
The world is in my palm motherfucker I need palm trees

[Intro]
"What's happenin' homie?"
"Hey man, get the valet man"
"Man slide me down right here in the front, man"
"Got yo 5 homie, nigga"
"Big Guwop"

[Verse 1]
I make a 100K a day, that’s a slap in the face
Me and Scooter ball in Vegas, just like Puffy & Mase
You know the way that Gucci play, don’t make me go in my safe
I wore my Louboutin's once, and then I throw 'em away
I’m drinkin’ Chandon, Sean John all in the day
This champagne and peach Ciroc, it got me higher than space
I said grace and drink my breakfast
Yeah a pint of the grape
Cook up a half a brick for lunch, and then I gave it away
I fornicate with my trigger, bring my scrap to the date
I duct tape your feet and legs, you won't wear nothin' but tape
They think I got a weight problem I get so much cake
You niggas hatin on the 'wop, that’s a female trait
I sell a million dollar verse, get your Gmail straight
I sixteen so hard it make your heart vibrate
Charger knockin pictures off the wall, there's no earthquake
They tried to kill my partner Rick Ross on his birthday

[Pre-Hook]
They say life is a bitch
But Gucci paying cash for it
Momma stressing hard
Cause she can't pay the landlord
I can never snitch
My family they don’t stand for it
And I wasn’t born rich
But being broke I just can't stand for

[Hook]
I stand on what I said nigga
That’s just what I stand for
My young nigga  jump overboard
That’s just what I stand for
All my niggas trappin’ hard
That’s just what I stand for
My chopper is my body guard
That’s just what I stand for

[Verse 2]
I bought a Buick Regal, man and I didn't have a license
Used to catch the buster walking just to buy my Nikes
I knew you'd turn pussy nigga I guess that makes me psychic
Got 100 young niggas with me all these niggas strapped
I ain’t tryin’ to diss your momma, but I bet your son won't try me
And your momma may not tell you, but I bet your sister like me
I'm like Tyson in his prime, man but I'm not with the fightin'
Yellow lightning on my wrist, my Roley's bigger than a Breitling
Just rolled a ounce up in a Philly Titan where the lighters
I'm King Midas bitches say your highness
Cause I’m draped diamonds
Call me smokey because I'm rocking ice cubes, booked up to Next Friday
And if you love me, like you say you love me baby hit the highway

[Pre-Hook], 

[Hook] x 2

[Hook. T.I.] (x2)
You can tell how I walk, I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
You can tell how I speak, I'm a king (I'm a king)
You can tell how I walk, you can tell how I walk
You can tell how I speak, I'm a king

[Verse 1: T.I.]
When I'm walkin' up, I'm bossin' up
And not even on purpose bruh
You talk too much, you soft as fuck
Your type I've seen it all too much
You don't want no boss, uh, and we knew it
And life for you or we make you cough it up, and keep going
I welcome you to danger zone
Now you continue on at your own risk
And I ain't with the scary shit cause when it's on, it's on
And I ain't gonna be backing down for shit
I'm ridin' chrome, going home with Hawaiian chick
I ran a major operation, you shit minor a bit
I walk like this designer cool cat around this bitch
And when I speak to you, King shit is all you get, nigga

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Who fuckin' with fat boy, I traffic my body weight
So much cake in the club damn near caught me a fair case
My old school is running Gatorade in my Chevy
My money is safe, I'm runnin' last 

[?]
We barricaded in front, the waterfalls in the back
Enough crack for a month, you smell it all in my raps
Niggas wanna be famous, I want the luxury tax
Not one of my checks look like my company facts
I'm pumpin' my gas comin' down Cleveland Ave
How much a nigga worth? Ho don't even ask
Ten mill with Diddy, I'm getting money with Tip
When you see me in the city then it's money we get

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: T.I.]
He in more shit, sure get the call he know

[?]
She fucked 3 ho bust in her throat then she one homie proposed

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Come, and bring the pieces to the master
He who organize by size then completes them with the plaster
Now, what should we call it?
After 12, cocktails prevails the inner alcoholic
Who knelt you by the toilets?
Remember, remember? Just like the Knights of Malta
Niggas like their liquor malted, manifested like a land without the Indian
Just all kith and foul kin
Whether Maltese or  Millennium
Saucer, Chaucer of the airwaves
Two assists: one Senegalese but her hair beige
The others hairs' shaved, both standing at the bottom of the staircase poised
But boys too coy to look in their face
Oi, bring the dowry, you can have 'em
On annual sabbatical, lookin' lousy in the cabin
Groomin's only prudent to continue working with humans
But ain't no livin' signals inside my circle of students

[Hook: Sirah]
Lilies in the valley of my heart
Lay you on your back and fall apart
Lately I been looking at the spores
It got my mind going back to Cali after dark
I got a problem with commitment, I'd say
Laying here waiting on waves
To wash away the palisades
Barriers and barricades
In the lilies in the valley of my heart

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Leave, and take these pictures to the pawn shop
Tell 'em you want the same amount of money that the one got
Pull up on the side of his Ghost and let the Dijon drop
If they muster up the courage to murk us at the Quran swaps
For the ones that tell you how to orchestrate the bomb plots
Taught you well on how to tell the impostors
Made an inner city Mosque in Mississippi, Madrassas
Much like differences in instances, itty-bitty is topless
That was food for the fingers
Dim the lights to set the mood for the singers
Who can turn the stage into a school for the redeemers?
Like an agent teaching Afghans to use the tool with the stingers
Useful as a back tire to a flat tire
A bazooka's your best friend until it backfires
Your strata needs a bunk bed ladder to climb up
And high hopes will put this whole matter behind us

[Hook: Sirah]

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Still, debunking the myth of a sleepover
As the enola sneaks over
The seat thinking ricolas fixes Ebola
Hol' up, heathens and thieves, in case police show up
Out the belly of the beast, making the streets blow up
Blowing in her hands, making the heat hold us in streaks
All my skills on the hilltop, you can hear a quill drop
Spoon full of sugar help the pill pop
Let us Tetris, little blocks until the bill clots
And then fill spots and make the field drop
Levels, wearing the baron's medals
Otherwise bare expect for a pair of petals
Somethin' like a bear except he's wearing a pareo
Fair safe haven to take your share of De Niro
In his care, might square to a pair of you share hold
Heavily invested to bury Harriet’s railroad

[Hook: Sirah]

[Verse]
And there are some things that you have to let go
And there are things, honey, that you and I only know

[Chorus]
But she'll never have half of what we had
She'll never have half of what we had
She'll never have half of what we had
She'll never have half of what we had

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And she'll never have half of what we had
She'll never have half of what we had
She'll never have half of what we had
She'll never have half of what we had

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And she'll never have half of what we had
She'll never have half of what we had
She'll never have half of what we had
She'll never have half of what we had

[Verse]
Methamphetamines, pink flamingo
Blue 50's queen, blue oyster cove
For the big dream, why don't we go
To Coney Island?
When the hour numb the guy lies on
The record spins blue '50s song
The veranda looks ocean now
Neon palms sway
What's happening? Where did we go?
The Jersey Shore was long ago
As with our hopes and ocean grove
And so I bid you farewell

[Intro]
Brainwashed to be more than particles (Particles)
Frequently aligning with the Sun
If you asked me what the future holds (Future holds nothing)
Another time, another set of particles

[Verse 1]
Know there’s a tear in the fabric of our souls
We are not what we are told
Don’t say that we are important, ‘cause we’re not
We are only seeking validation

Don’t say we are more than we are
Don’t say we are more than we are

[Verse 2]
He had gotten home, the door was unlocked
Walking in he felt that someone else was there
He could never understand the things he lacked inside
How could she do everything she did to him?

[Hook]
Don’t say I’m important
Don’t say I’m the one
Don’t say I’m important
Don’t say I’m the one
Don’t say that you loved me!
Don’t say that you loved me!

Corridor led to dishonesty
Corridor led to dishonesty
Corridor led to dishonesty
Corridor led to dishonesty

[Bridge: Shane Gann]
And as if that wasn’t enough
You sent me running in circles until I finally hit the bottle again
And again, and again, and again
You sent me running in circles until I finally hit the bottle again
And again, and again, and again
You sent me running in circles until I finally hit the bottom again

[Outro]
Brought up to be more than particles
Frequently aligning with the Sun
If you asked me what the future holds
Another time, another set of particles

[Verse 1]
Garbage in; garbage out
Questions still persist
The way in which we were created is still debated heavily
If we’re an experiment, where’s the Petri dish located?
And who’s the one conducting tests?

[Chorus]
God, are you listening?!
All your careful people call for what they need
What if you’re not real?
And we’re wasting all of the precious time we have for worship
When we’re getting nothing back, back

[Refrain]
Fairy tales in a parlor with a basket filled with dollars
A way to vent frustration
Maybe we buy salvation
What if I’m wrong?
What if I’m wrong?

[Hook]
And I’ll burn in an apocalyptic realm

[Verse 3]
When we seek intelligence we’re told to look up for answers
The truth might not be what we thought
But are we willing to look away if nothing happens?
What makes a heart beat?

[Chorus]
God, you’re not listening!
All your careful people call for what they need
What if you’re not real?
And we’re wasting all of the precious time we have for worship
When we’re getting nothing back
Martyr!
What if I’m wrong? (There’s no way to take it back)

[Refrain]
Fairy tales in a parlor with a basket filled with dollars
A way to vent frustration
Maybe we buy salvation
What if I’m wrong?
What if I’m wrong?

[Outro]
And I'll burn in an apocalyptic realm
And I'll burn in an apocalyptic realm
I'll burn (I'll burn)
I'll burn (I'll burn)

[Verse 1]
Every time that you leave my house
I fear that your truck flips, or crashes
I’m always assuming the worst
It’s not healthy to be so fucking anxious and desperate
My train of thought always derails

[Chorus]
All is calm at the moment
Nothing’s wrong as of now
But my heart drops when the telephone rings
“I’m not sure you’re the one.”
Do you think that it’s time to let our lives divide?

[Verse 2]
I’ll reflect where we met
Back at the restaurant where we worked
Remember our booth in the back room?
Things were much simpler then
Post college daydreams on Ivy
Learning your curves in the bed

[Chorus]
All is calm at the moment
Nothing’s wrong as of now
But my heart drops when the telephone rings
“I’m not sure you’re the one.”
If you think that it’s time then let our lives divide

[Intro]
Do you ever get the feeling that you're floating?
Do you ever get the sense that your body is gone?

[Chorus]
Awake, out of focus
Unnerved, unnerved
This place might not be the same one that I know so well
Out of sync with time again, feels so real this time
Out of sync and violently aware that something’s off

[Verse 1]
Technically there’s a chance I might be in a dream
Repeating scenes again, witnessing grieving friends
Mother’s caring eyes
They carry pain I’ve never seen, so hysterically

[Bridge 1]
“He’s still here. He’s still here.” Where?
“He’s still here. He’s still here.”
“He’s still here. He’s still here.”
“He’s still here. He’s still here.”

[Refrain]
I’m a floating skeptic (Who are they burying?)
Curious perspective (Don’t know when to lose)
Like that time we met disaster
Covered up in sheets of plaster
Driving faster!
I taste the pavement on my tongue
Punctured lung
Laughing off the warning just because
Faltered breathing
I’m not leaving

[Chorus]
Awake, out of focus
Unnerved, unnerved
This place might not be the same one that I know so well
Out of sync with time again, feels so real this time
Out of sync and violently aware that something’s off

[Bridge 2]
They’ve seen enough
They’ve seen enough
Carry on
Carry on

[Verse 3]
Brother, why won’t you answer?
You seem to suffer like I’m gone
No! is that my cadaver?
This can’t be over! Take me home
No! Don’t you put me under
Just hold me closer
To me, I’m not gone

[Bridge 3]
I’m not breathing
I’m not leaving
I’m not leaving
I’m not leaving

[Refrain]
I’m a floating skeptic (Who are they burying?)
Curious perspective (Don’t know when to lose)
Like that time we met disaster
Covered up in sheets of plaster
Driving faster!
I taste the pavement on my tongue
Just because

[Outro]
“He’s still here…"
“He’s still here…"
“He’s still here…"
“He’s still here…"
When it's just you and me
There's no place I'd rather be
You make my days bright as the sun
Each moment with you I adore
'Cause there is no one like you girl
I'm just a fool for you, baby
I can't keep my cool

Lalalalalala...

There's nothing I wouldn't do
To put myself closer to you
Every time that I look in your eyes
I see a reflection of me
Don't ever leave me alone
Without you where would I be?

Lalalalalala...

[Hook]

Trap God
Burr!
Yeahhhhh

[Verse 1]

I'm a trap god Trapping out these catalogs (Gucci!)
Selling weed and selling hard like I'm the god of bars
I'm a trap god sketching plays on blvd
And I'm still selling nicks and splits behind these burglar bars
I'm a trap god them young boys got me paranoid
And I wake up selling cake so I guess I do have a job
I'm a trap god me run out of dope is odd
And you just signed with Brick Squad records
So you just joined the mob
I'm a trap god all these squares in my house
A couple mil' on my couch
If you my spouse and you move in see too much you can't move out
Don't choose me you lose out
Brought the goons out and we gooned out
Hit the move with us get moved out
Nigga try me and I'm shooting out
Tuesday I rock toolie
Usually I got uzis
I'mma pimp see, we had a bond b, but you tried to dj screw me
Gotta bookbag full of oz's, and I ain't finna go to P.E
Get a 3 5 get a 1 5, 8 ball c e t
Ask those who knew me, started off from a QP
I'm much more than a mc, bricks 35 that's KD
These bricks coming from Cali, This mid coming from AZ
Trap hard like 8 3, got 70 in my AP
I'm a trap god

[Chorus: Nikki Jean & Lupe Fiasco]
Haile Selassie, high as the eyelids of osprey, I'm thriving
Poseidon, your trident can't stop me, from diving
I'm looking for my, looking for my, looking for my, as I float
Brand new shell for my ghost, tattoos all on my coast

[Interlude: Lupe Fiasco]
"Throughout history, it has been the inaction of those who could have acted
The indifference of those who should have known better
The silence of the voice of justice when it mattered most
This, has made it possible for evil to triumph."
- Selassie, uhh

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Man's limitation, transfiguration
Haka dance done at the welcome to the demo
Modern man comes to the weddin' in the limo
Mixin' doves with the rice rain
Uncle Ben's off the rails on the night train
And that storm took us to the platform, pushas
Back to the bachelor's backdoor, unhook us
Hope this track take you back to where the fat girl pushed us
And that's very old
Like Blackberry Bold but the juice
Sweeter than where the party at, or
Releasing these niggas from the roofs, and
Leavin' these niggas on the loose, or
Keepin' these niggas in the coops, and
Leavin' these niggas on the noose, free!
Shamu fan got a world to see!

[Chorus: Nikki Jean & Lupe Fiasco]
Haile Selassie, high as the eyelids of osprey, I'm thriving
Poseidon, your trident can't stop me, from diving
I'm looking for my, looking for my, looking for my, as I float
Brand new shell for my ghost, tattoos all on my coast

[Interlude: Lupe Fiasco]
"Then until the philosophy which holds one race superior and another inferior
Is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned
That until there no longer first class and second class citizens of any nation
Until the color of a man's skin is of no more significance than the color of his eyes."
- Selassie

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
To the limit, the limit in the Methadone clinic
Ridin' with the pack like a Peloton
Flyin' with the sack in the trap like the pregnant
As it breaks in the backs from the cracks that we step upon
If I triple my worth, will it cripple my mom?
If I simple my search, will it mental my calm?
Will it hurt if I give you my palm?
To tell in it, don't put a nail in it
How you gonna see the world if you a whale in it
And readin' my palms like there's braille in it (braille in it)
Is it the trail or the forest? (forest)
Or the forest with the trail in it?
That's a sail with a 12 in it
Water coming through from impalin' it (water come through for me now)
Nothin' left of the boat but my holes
Still I fill up the world and I float like Haile

[Chorus: Nikki Jean & Lupe Fiasco]
Haile Selassie, high as the eyelids of osprey, I'm thriving
Poseidon, your trident can't stop me, from diving
I'm looking for my, looking for my, looking for my, as I float
Brand new shell for my ghost, tattoos all on my coast

[Interlude: Lupe Fiasco]
"A qualified man with vision, unmoved by daily selfish interests
Led to right decisions by his conscience
In general, a man who knows from whence he comes
And where he's going will cooperate with his fellow human beings
He will not be satisfied with merely doing his ordinary duties
But will inspire others by his good example
You are being watched by the nation
And you should realize, that you will satisfy it if you do good
But on the contrary, you do evil
It will lose its hope and confidence in you."
- Selassie

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Hydrant open wide, on the side of the colonized
Swimmin' in the street, fell asleep on my mama thighs
Blockin' out the noise that destroys little boys
Live enjoy, ships ahoy, get deployed by the rock-a-byes
D-d-d-deep into the sea of my dreams
Lyin' fall asleep at the feet of my queen
Hawk, I'ma write to the beat of your wings
Song for the Ethiopian King, Haile

[Chorus: Nikki Jean & Lupe Fiasco]
Haile Selassie, high as the eyelids of osprey, I'm thriving
Poseidon, your trident can't stop me, from diving
I'm looking for my, looking for my, looking for my, as I float
Brand new shell for my ghost, tattoos all on my coast
Haile Selassie, high as the eyelids of osprey, I'm thriving
Poseidon, your trident can't stop me, from diving
I'm looking for my, looking for my, looking for my, as I float
Brand new shell for my ghost, tattoos all on my coast

[Intro]
That's the shit I'm talking 'bout though, like you changed up, you don't even fuckin' link nobody no more, you just dash me away like a cyattie. Yo, you cheesed me dog

[Verse 1]
Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you
Shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls' numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the bar exam
I drove in the snow for you? Yeah
You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then
But how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now (Stuck right now)
Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then
But how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now, yeah (Stuck right now)
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl
How 'bout now? Yeah
Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?
What about now, girl, how 'bout now?

[Interlude]
My heart belongs to you...

[Verse 2]
Yeah, always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain't even say thank you
I had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like "who's this?" I be like "me, girl"
You be like "oh, word, true shit?"
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Them car rides made me feel like I was losin' it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Or I was average like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been

[Chorus]
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then
But how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now (Stuck right now)
Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then
Girl, how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now, yeah (Stuck right now)
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl
How 'bout now? Yeah
Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?
What about now, girl, how 'bout now?

[Outro]
My heart belongs to you
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do

[Verse]
When you're alone
And I'm alone
I could touch your hair three months ago
But now it makes you so upset

[Chorus]
But you say I don't know how to love
I simply don't understand my life

[Verse 2]
You can say you don't know
But I remember football in the snow
Everybody's gone home
Why don't you love me anymore?

[Chorus]
But you say I don't know how to love
I simply don't understand my life
But you say I don't know how to love
I simply don't understand my life
But you say I don't know how to love
I simply don't understand my life

[Verse 1]
Look at what you've done
Stand still, fallin' away from me
When it takes so long
Fire's out, what do you want to be?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm holdin’ on
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now, every other day I'll be watching you

[Chorus]
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside

[Verse 2]
So you give me no reason
For me to stay close to you
Tell me what lovers do
How are we still breathing?
It's never for us to choose
I'll be the strength in you

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm holdin’ on
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now, every other day I'll be watching you

[Chorus]
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside

[Outro]
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
I'll show you what it feels like
Show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside

[Refrain]
You think you're bad
You think you're so fucking cool
Generation N-E-Y, we're already dead
If you don't give a fuck then I don't give a damn
But down with the scene that makes it so numb

[Verse 1]
I'm in the parking lot there's not a lot I've got
Some pig on a Harley trying to sell me pot
I come and shut the doors their tinted glass door
Another stupid chore as I'm on the wet floor

[Hook]
You can have my money but you can't have me
You can have my money but you can't have me
You can have my money but you can't have me
You can have my money but you can't have me

[Verse 2]
Show me, buy me, tune me, ship me, tell me, wind me, store me
You can have my money but you can't have me
Here's my money give me shit I don't need
To me what you say I need is just so unnecessary

[Hook]
You can have my money but you can't have me
You can have my money but you can't have me
You can have my money but you can't have me
You can have my money but you can't have me

You think you're bad
You think you're so fucking cool
Generation N E Y we're already dead
If you don't give a fuck then I don't give a damn
But down with the scene that makes it so numb
You think you're bad
You think you're so fucking cool
Generation N E Y we're already dead
If you don't give a fuck then I don't give a damn
But down with the scene that makes it so numb

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
She drive five hours for a nigga just to get some long dick
No flowers from her nigga out in Luxembourg
She came to Paris for a nigga
She want to introduce her parents to a nigga, shit
I just came from Milan, I had a threesome with two white bitches
Almost had a four but the black girl didn't even like bitches
I let her suck the dick, and passed her to my nigga
Bunch of bad bitches in Geneva
Twenty bottles in the club on my Visa
Smokin' like a Taylor at my table, uh
It's Pushaz Inc., the motherfuckin' label, and that XO
All my niggas on they think, we sold our souls to the devil
Local niggas say that, tell 'em to first get on my level
Out in Bern in the coupe slidin'
With a bitch, 'bout to get it poppin'

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Ty Dolla $ign]
And she gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like
Baby, you know what I like

[Verse 2: Belly]
Dabbin' up, dabbin' up, I just hit the wax for breakfast
Bitches tryna leave, crib so big can't find a exit
Chest feeling heavy like I 69'd with Precious-weight
Chest feeling heavy like I'm pourin' up in Texas
Told a bitch come over give me a perm, spit some G to ya
Don't you tell these hoes what you learn, this is free for ya
Kush got a triple action on some smokey shit
Long dick reach deep down, in fallopian
Half Brazilian her ass was Amazonian
Dab by the slab, got you feeling like it's opium
XO, bad hoes they call me Dablo Esco
Unless it's money me no hablo
Still wish I could have you, now I wish you would leave
Got niggas payin' your rent, you keep a trick up your sleeve
Money hidden in the walls like it's insulation
Couple Asian bitches, call it an orientation

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Ty Dolla $ign]
And she gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like
Baby, you know what I like

[Break: The Weeknd]
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like

[Verse 3: The Weeknd]
I just passed that "nigga fell off" stage
Just sold out the O2 at my own pace
I can say that I’m attached to nobody
I been getting paper while these niggas tryna stop me
Shout my nigga Doc, that’s a mentor
Had some bad business, nothing personal
But now the word out that we back
On some young Quincy Jones, dark skin Michael Jackson
And these the motherfuckers that they packaged
Their new shit all be sounding like my past shit
Bring your girl to my show, give her floor seats
Then she go downtown like she owe me
XO, XO, XO
Mix it up, pour it up, take it down slow
This is my sound, nigga, fuck your sound
Did it from the ground, ask around, bitch
When I touch down, I'ma shake shit up
Fuck your new man, I'ma break it up
He can come back when I go on the road
But that pussy mine for the next three months
’Cause the kid back, kid back, kid back
Cop ten whips for my niggas when we land
Queen Street nigga making money overseas
Had a few more debts, I'ma pay it all in cash
Shout out XO, shout out to the boy
Broke bread on tour, man, it’s all love now
Shout my nigga Stix, doing good in these streets
Bet he popping more bottles than us right now
Reason why they stressing, city never sunny
When the kid come through with more niggas than Apollo
But ain’t shit funny, can’t nobody stop me
All my hoes are trained, I make all of them swallow

[Outro]
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
I make all of them swallow
All of, all of
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
I make all of them swallow

[:Intro]
Ha ha
Yea
Uh
Real shit
Check it out yo

[:Chorus]
Get a grip, get it fast
More smoke, more cash
DPG with the blue flag
One ratchet ho with a fat ass
Category, set it free, west coast
Motherfucker let it be
Get a grip, get it fast
More smoke, more cash

[:Kurupt]
Get it good, get it fast
All spark, all ass
Hit it 2 times, puff puff pass
Big Snoop, big Daz
Young Gotti, get it Gotti
Somebody in here smellin like hot karate
And that’s the way you comin up in this
No homo, and you expect to crack a bitch
Game for ya, good to ya
Then it’s still ‘fore you crack a bitch and let er spoil
Man I got bitches by the dozen tho
Didn’t know it, fucked er wrong and cracked my cousin’s ho
Superficial, so official, like a referee’s whistle
Test the G, test to me, next to be test the pistols
Coming off the deep dark circle of the VP
Gray and blue since you knew a Snoop ’92 or 3
This is how the motherfucker west is won
Ox cock to knock out his oxygen
Cuz we get it good, get it fast
Move, dance, everybody sag

[:Chorus]

[:Snoop Dogg]
Uhh, what a nigga really know about getting money out of this?
To the house, turn ‘em out, real shit
Gave a bitch real dick, that’s it, what a pity
Now she workin at sin City, poppin it, droppin it for cash
How long this shit gon last?
I move fast, grab me another ho
Yellow and thick, I’m drinking on tequila
Drapped in all feela, rollin my weed up
Click on seeder, straight off the meter
3 stripes for life, I’m paid my Adidas
Fly senioritas, good time to meet us
4-20 after dark, down by seritas
Home of the Steelers, cat feelers and dealers
Or I’d own a bitch, no lane, for whip up hillas, killas
They kill in the day time, wanna be seen
I’m on a bad bitch, with a purse full of green
We grew up on the same blunt but we’re not the same kind
Game over, nigga it’s game time
I swing mine like a 6 deuce turnt up
Til it get loose I’m on the blunt, she on the pill you bitch
You…

[:Chorus]

[Hook: The-Dream]
We said we'd never be, just a memory
And even though it breaks my soul
Still I'll never let your heart go
We're running way too fast, ohh
Chasing down that blue grass, yeah
Hope I didn't break your soul
And no I'll never let your heart go

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ay, man, remember all a nigga had
With 20 grand cash, it was all in the bag
And we got it all with the crack
Lookin for the plug in the mall with the gat
No, you never loaned me a pack
But he loaned me a ride with it all in the back
How could you just call me with that
Acting like you think you gettin all of it back
Still remember standin all alone in the trap
Waitin on a plate, lookin for a way
And damn a big car pull up on me one day
Got a homie Toomp to put some beats on tape
And it's been on since then
Damn can't believe you been gone since then
Huh, I really miss my nigga
Tramel this for you, know you up there nigga

[Hook: The-Dream]
We said we'd never be, just a memory
And even though it breaks my soul
Still I'll never let your heart go
We're running way too fast, ohh
Chasing down that blue grass, yeah
Hope I didn't break your soul
And no I'll never let your heart go

[Bridge: The-Dream & (T.I.)]
And no I'll never let your
Your, ohh, ohh
Your, ohh, ohh, ohh
(Ay, if you miss your nigga like I miss my nigga)
(Sing, sing) Ohh, ohh, ohh
(Ay, on the inside nigga you still tough)
Your

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Ay, remember when we were just 16
Mind on one thing, how to be street kings
Now we numb like morphine
To the gunplay everyday is a war scene
But ya'll was my nigga
No matter what I knew I could call on my nigga
And any bullshit involving my niggas
30 rounds in the clip, spray it all for my niggas
Yeah, cap, we were just teenagers
Provin to the G's in the hood we able
To ball on these haters
Doin a movie screen made ya, you and me playa
Damn, why they have to give my nigga life
We can ball like a god 'til we bring him back
Really miss you nigga ain't a motha fuckin lie
Pimp squad til we die, free my nigga cap

[Hook: The-Dream]
We said we'd never be, just a memory
And even though it breaks my soul
Still I'll never let your heart go
We're running way too fast, ohh
Chasing down that blue grass, yeah
Hope I didn't break your soul
And no I'll never let your heart go

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Huh, I admit it I've seen
Back in the day how silly I seemed
Selling cocaine wasn't really my dream
Could get my family farther than anyone seen
Ay, and if anyone seen
Where I made it today probably really one thing
One 12 in the face, no he finna run games
Ain't gon trick me into sayin any one name
Nope, well go sit in the cell about that
For weeks I was mad in the head about that
Police sayin shit really wasn't my shit
It was his and he knew I wasn't playin bout that
Hey, for every time I'm strapped
The 12 ride by, they ain't finding my strap
Judge woulda had a nigga heart bout that
A nigga woulda sensed some bad blood by that

[Hook: The-Dream]
We said we'd never be, just a memory
And even though it breaks my soul
Still I'll never let your heart go
We're running way too fast, ohh
Chasing down that blue grass, yeah
Hope I didn't break your soul
And no I'll never let your heart go

[Verse]
Yeah
It's the realness
City of the steel, where the films is
Bill shit, ballin' like a smaller Josh Childress
I'm in the buildin', swagger on a million
Ill shit, in my bitch pussy like a drill-bit
MILFs get hunted down, pussy age like fine wine
Busy ol' clock in the dark, hard to find time
Spittin' out iodine, rhymin' on advance
Finna burn ya, put the magnifyin' glass to all you ants
It's fire everywhere we go
Nobody watch you anymore, like Drew Carey shows
Comin' through your stereo, here to cause the chaos
Bitches throwin' bras on stage, hit 'em with paintballs, shit
"How'd you make out?"
Pretty good, got a mansion and a lakehouse
Millions off of PayPal, in the table at the steakhouse
Man, life is brilliant, militant, still the shit, killin' off civilians
All these white rappers, I'ma never meet my children
That don't go for everybody, just the obvious ones
I'm on the boat, 'bout to eat when this tilapia come
I put the cocaine away, I'm drinkin' coffee a bunch
So what you in it for? Pretty sure it's more than a hunch
Wrote the formula for defeat in the form of orderin' such
A warrior, I'm too much
Watchin' porn on a camcorder while I'm orderin' lunch
I give you more than enough, what?
The young heavyweight, rappin' on detonate
Reading Hemingway, I been a leader, not a lemming, better get it straight
Fuck the system, bitch, it's time for prison break
I been a great, shake it, got you fallin' just for timber's sake
And I ain't Justin Timberlake, but I ain't much intimidatin'
Waitin' patiently, like can't you see? This shit is innovation
Been creatin', standin' on the roof, I feel the shingles breakin'
I'm just spittin' raps and y'all be single-makin'
Unlock ankle bracelet, paper chasin', in the pussy, procreation
Grand slam, load the bases, in the zone, bring 'em home
Been around the globe, done a hundred thousand shows
Now I'm in album mode, everything I touch, it turn to valuable
Pittsburgh, pile of snow
Never gave a fuck about a slut, I pile-drive a ho
Wild lion, tiger flow
Expert rhymer, never will I tire with these firestones
You might as well retire, go and find a home

[Intro: Meek Mill]

Your car note on my jeans, my sneaks bloody as shit

I ask your bitch do all this money make her nervous
She do it good and I'mma pay her  for her service
When bosses talking shut your mouth if you a worker
Cause I've been working chasing money like I'm hurting
Getting pussy in my Maybach think the driver heard us
Roll the partition up
All in the cut ain't like this broad give a fuck
I know she down for whatever gon' do it all for a buck
And now that Boosie back home know we gon' ball for a month
Cause real niggas come first that's why we all in the front
And suckas all in the back, and all of us strapped
Why don't we fuck with you pussy niggas, cause all of them rats

Ice man conscious and my money, it grow on trees
Sicker than ever richer than ever call a Brinks truck

Buzz strong money long street nigga real as fuck

No 360 deal this shit real get all my show money
Hold up let me let my money talk
My rollie cost your house, my shows sold out
Got more thousand dollar jeans that there's stores up in the South
In my heart I'm a boss and this is this is this is what the fuck I'm mean
Boosie Badazz ball biggest bank rolls

[Spoken: Lianne La Havas]
Before you have any interaction with members of the opposite sex, we’re going to have to debrief you thoroughly over the course of the next few sessions. Today though, we’ll just start off with some simple affirmations, that will be automatically induced into your memory temple , which you can upload unto a hard drive, and review at your desire.

Affirmation number one: there are no such words as me or mine. Words of this nature were introduced into society as a control mechanism, which systematically divided the subjects, first individually, and then as a collective. From now on…

[Spoken: Lianne La Havas]
How are you feeling today, Mister Nelson?
I trust you're having a quick and enjoyable adjustment period
As you can see, we’re communicating now telepathically
(Telepathically)
Telepathically
Which makes things move so much faster here
After you’ve completed the planned affirmation therapy, you’ll find this way of interaction far easier

[Refrain: Delilah]
Until I, I find my, my way back, home, home

[Spoken: Lianne La Havas]
You’ve probably felt for many years in your former life
That you were separate from not only others, but even yourself
Now you can see that was never the case
You are actually everything and anything that you can think of
All of it is you

[Refrain: Delilah]
Until I, I find my, my way back, home, home
Until I, I find my, my way back, home
My way back home
Until I, I find my, my way back, home, home
Until I, I find my, my way back, home
Until I, I find my, my way back, home, home

[Spoken: Lianna La Havas]
Remember there is really only one destination
And that place is you
All of it
Everything
Is you

[Refrain: Delilah]
Until I, I find my, my way back, home, home
Until I, I find my, my way back, home

[Spoken Intro: Lianne La Havas]
... any person or object, what so ever that requires your attention, is something that has veered from its path and preordained destiny of total enlightenment

[Verse 1: Prince]
Never wanted
A typical life
Scripted role
Huh, trophy wife
All I ever wanted, to be left alone
See my beds made up at night 'cause in my dreams I roam
Just trying to find
Trying to find

[Refrain: Prince & Lianne La Havas]
My way back
Back home

[Verse 2: Prince]
So many reasons why
(There's so many reasons why)
I don't belong here
But now that I am I
(Without fear I am)
Gonna conquer with no fear

[Refrain: Prince & Lianne La Havas]
Until I
(Until I)
Find
(I find my)
My
(My way back)
Way back home
Until I
(Until I)
Find
(I find my)
My
(My way back)
Way back home

(Find my way back home)

[Verse 3: Prince]
Most people in this world
(Most of the people in this world)
Are born dead
But I was born alive
(I was born with this dream)
Dream outside my head (outside my head)

[Refrain: Prince & Lianne La Havas]
That I
(Until I)
Could find my
(I find my)
My
(My way back)
Way back home

My
(Until I)
My
(I find my)
Way
(My way back)
Way back home

[Verse 4: Prince]
Is this the way?
Power to the ones:
Power to the ones who can raise a child like me
The path is set, but if you look the truth will set us free
I've heard about those happy endings, but it's still a mystery
Let me tell you about me
I'm happiest

[Refrain: Prince & Lianne La Havas]
When I can see
(Until I)
(I find my)
(My way back)
My way back home

Can you see
(Until I)
(I find my)
(My way back)
My way back, my way back, home

[Intro: Chris Brown]
I don't know what it is, there's just something about you
Huh, I mean I don't think I can be in love this early
But maybe I can
But you the best

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
All of these chances we take from day-to-day
Constantly working, traveling from place-to-place
I wanna find a place where my love can stay
So you just promise you won't give my love away
Girl, let's get our dance on
And I'ma kiss your neck and put my hands on your body

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
We can do this thing nice and slow
We can take it 'round the world, let's go
Girl, you know you play the biggest part
Take it back to the start where we fell in love
Ooh girl, you got that body, I can't take it, babe
I want it, I just really, really want it
Got anything you need, baby
Just come with me, baby, ah-ah

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
It don't matter where we go, London, that's Heathrow
I'll take you around the world, baby, and back
Because you're special (Oh)

And you know I'm a go-getter, and shawty is a winner
I need a girl who wants you just like that (Yeah)
Because you're special
You the best yo, oh, let's go

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Girl, your body matches your face, and I want it all
Bring your body over here, I ain't scared to break you off
I'm 'bout to go in so hard, deeper and deeper
(Givin' into your body, I love your body, baby)
If me and your body could love exchange
All these positions, girl, let's switch it up

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
We can do this thing nice and slow
We can take it 'round the world, let's go
Girl, you know you play the biggest part
Take it back to the start where we fell in love
Ooh girl, you got that body, I can't take it, babe
I want it, I just really, really want it
Got anything you need, baby
Just come with me, baby, ah-ah

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
It don't matter where we go (Yeah), London, that's Heathrow

And you know I'm a go-getter, and shawty is a winner
I need a girl who wants you just like that (Yeah)
Because you're special
You the best yo, oh, let's go

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Can't nobody else, do me like you do
Make a nigga wanna spend them dollars on you, boo
Do it by yourself, girl, that's all you-ou
I can't get your booty out of my mind
Girl, you're a stallion, you know you the tru-uth
Can we make love right now? (Oh-oh)
Right now (Oh-oh), right now (Oh-oh)
Right now, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
It don't matter where we go, London, that's Heathrow

And you know I'm a go-getter, and shawty is a winner
I need a girl who wants you just like that (Yeah)
Because you're special
You the best yo, oh, let's go

[Verse 1]
Everybody walks in different directions
Whole world's running to each his own
It's a place that justifies it all
And nobody's ever wrong
I guess we got agreed to disagree
Even if we say it in the same song
You can try to change your life that don't wanna be true
If we all see eye to eye, whole world will be grey

[Hook]
So let's keep running
To each his own
If we all keep running
Then we can toast
To each his own
And we'll be alright
And we'll be alright

Alright

[Verse 2]
Everybody wants for success for whatever that is
The world world's running for each his own
It's a place where the truth stays in the line
Cause nobody ever lies
And we follow our hearts into the night
Wake up, thank God to be alive
You can try to save a life that don't wanna be saved
If we all see eye to eye, the world will be grey

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I am who I am
You are who you are
I could wish on the clouds
And you could wish on the stars
We could be alright
We'll be alright
Alright
We'll be alright

[Verse 1]
Flashing lights and we
Took a wrong turn and we
Fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
And spinning out of control

[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't they tell us "Don't rush into things"?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twistin' around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night

[Chorus]
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (Eh, eh)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better (Eh, eh)

[Post-Chorus]
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland

[Verse 2]
So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone, or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't they tell us "Don't rush into things"?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twistin' around me
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind
But darlin'

[Chorus]
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (Eh, eh)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better (Eh, eh)

[Post-Chorus]
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
Whoa, in Wonderland

[Bridge]
I reached for you, but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end, in Wonderland
We both went mad
Oh

[Chorus]
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Last forever (Eh, eh)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it (Got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better
Never better (Eh, eh)
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
And we pretended it could last forever (In Wonderland)
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
And life was never worse but never better
In Wonderland

[Verse 1]
It's 2 AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

[Chorus]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

[Verse 2]
It's 2 AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around

[Chorus]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for, and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

[Post-Chorus]
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I

[Bridge]
You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
(I wish I, wish I)

[Verse 3]
2 AM, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

[Chorus]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for, and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

[Outro]
(I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I)
You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would, I wish you would)
(I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I)
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I wish you would

[Verse 1]
Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

[Pre-Chorus]
In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

[Chorus]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in my mind, only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Been losing grip, on sinking ships
You showed up just in time

[Chorus]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

[Post-Chorus]
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)

[Bridge]
Your kiss, my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you're young, you just run
But you come back to what you need

[Chorus]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
(This love) This love left a permanent mark
(This love) This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh
(This love) These hands had to let it go free, and
(This love) This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

[Post-Chorus]
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love)
This love, this love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 1]
One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you play it back
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
No proof, not much, but you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck
He says, "Look up"
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch, but you felt enough

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love

[Verse 2]
Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once, you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night, he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses, then says "You're my best friend"
And you knew what it was, he is in love

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love

[Bridge]
And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, 'round and 'round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now
Why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words

[Breakdown]
'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love

[Verse 1]
The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
You're still all over me
Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

[Chorus]
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
There was nothing left to do (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

[Pre-Chorus]
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing

[Chorus]
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Post-Chorus]
I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Said, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it

[Breakdown]
The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
(Oh)

[Chorus]
The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean

[Outro]
(Oh, oh)
Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
(Oh, oh, oh)
Think I'm finally clean

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I (I, I, I, I)

[Verse 1]
You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling, dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run

[Chorus]
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

[Verse 2]
Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time

[Pre-Chorus]
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run

[Chorus]
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

[Bridge]
They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love

[Chorus]
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

[Outro]
They take their shots, but we're bulletproof (I know places)
And you know for me, it's always you (I know places)
In the dead of night, your eyes so green (I know places)
And I know for you, it's always me (I know places)
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I

[Verse 1]
He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

[Verse 2]
I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ha, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

[Bridge]
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' (Burnin') it (It) down (Down)
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow (Follow) you (You) around
(Follow you around)

[Breakdown]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (Just pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ah)
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
Even if it's just in your
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 2]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kinds of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're coming my way
Just don't

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Bridge]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em (Think we can solve 'em)
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done (Look what you've done)
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Biatch!
Uh, yo

[Verse 1]
I spit a racial slur honkey sue me
This is my horror flick
So the black guy doesn't die in my movie
Drunk, high and kinda unruly it's yours truly
Automatics load my words like they flying out of a Uzi
From the boonies, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Where they either wash you away or they dockin' your pay
I'm not with the play
I'm feelin' like Pac in a way
Cause shorty wanna be a thug I'm on the block to this day
I keep smokin' to the face they say the weed got me crazy
And I been dealin' with Wallace and living lately
I don't know if honestly God is gon' wanna save me
All that bad karma I don't wanna have no baby
See I've been thriving between heaven and hell
In the system niggas destined to fail
I make mistakes and learn my lessons as well
But the police want me to rest in a cell
All cause I'm black I'm startin' to question myself
But a young live nigga when it's speaking on the trigga
We ain't scared mothafuckas you don't really want it with us
Young live nigga when it's speaking on the trigga
We ain't scared mothafucka you don't really want it with us, uh

[Hook]
(Fuck how y'all niggas feel)
Y'all niggas don't want it with me, I said
(Fuck how y'all niggas feel)
Y'all niggas don't want it with me, uh

[Verse 2]
They don't wanna see me winnin' cause my skin tone
Devil got us drinking out of the water My mind been gone
In this gang known to be a player get my limp on
Evil chasing me gon' catch me dancin' in the end zone
Feel like somebody watchin'
Sure there's someone recording me
Government tellin' us lies used to act accordingly
Swear to God you niggas and your ignorance annoyin' me
There's more to see
Bringin' out the shell that's what's important G
They keep a nigga timid
Only visions of the limelight
Cause nothin' screams danger like a nigga with his mind right
Takin' my pictures bro what you doin' for your klondike
Your heart in conditions you ain't equippin' for this prime right
Tell me lord somebody come and get me
Wait on what I'm livin' for
Wanna talk to God but I feel like my prayers get ignored
Ballin' cause I speak it on the trigga
A young live nigga you don't really want it with us what up

[Hook]

[Outro]
If you ain't down with that, shut yo god damn ass up

[Intro]
Zay, Gucci!
Zay you the greatest

[Verse 1]
I got a stash full of bands cuz I rubber band thick
I got a passion for the pan, I'm a water whip wizard
If you shop with Gucci Mane I bet your grams jump back
Got that flashback dope I bring your Grandpa back
And when that choppa in my hand, you gon' be the running man
And I count the money faster than a money counter can
You ain't getting shit back once the money change hands (bitch!)
For 50 keys of the sand, go to war with Jackie Chan
I text your baby brother twice and told him bring me my bands
Bricksquad so deep go to war with Iran
Half a mil on the plane but I'm flying air train
And if they come back to yo hood no mo' but I can 

[???]

[Hook]
I'm still making dope boy music
Treat a Bentley like a four door Chevy
My mama said she can't feed no sissies
Beat up on my big bruh wouldn't let me
16 oz in a pint and it won't change
36 in a brick and it won't change
Rich nigga keepin' it hood cuz it won't change
I'm just another nigga came up in the dope game

[Verse 2]
Since an infant they put me on this pimpin
My brother trap and I'm his personal assistant
I had a knot so big in the lunch line
They called my momma told her that I'm on the dope grind
Big bag, riff raff try me they'll get shit-bagged
Ballistic(?) the car you just bought I'm tryna hit that
Fuck nigga, get back, 'fore you dun get head cracked
Quarter mil, everybody dead but the Kit Kat
Blitz me, I'll blitz back my career I will risk that
Kush so strong, people asking where you get that
I'ma have money nigga long as they print that
Same flow cuz I ain't broke so ain't no need to fix that

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Had a 9 mil, Zay was making hits in his basement
Hit the club, jump the line, I ain't with that wait shit
Here's 500, I ain't beggin you to play shit
Jazzy T(?) wasted before I made Wasted
RIP to Magic, damn that shit was tragic
Even though we bumped heads didn't wanna see you in a casket
I remember at least 6 different times that you blasted
Never kiss ass, real niggas never ass kiss
Nigga tried to kill me for a chain, nigga you could have it
People think I'm crazy like the Ol' Dirty Bastard (RIP)
I'm proud to say I helped my nigga Waka get a mansion
I wish my nigga Dunk was here I'd help him get a palace

[Hook]

[Intro: Jeezy]
I step up in this bitch like Moses
Damn right, motherfucker, Red Sea got departed (oooh!)
This is that "All About The Money" remix?
Well, I'ma kill a motherfucker before it even get started
We got London on da... (Yeeaaah!)
The chrome to the bricks, nigga rag to the riches
Damn right, nigga did it with the soda
Nigga still livin' like a G, keep some niggas 'round me
That'll kill your ass like some Ebola
I count six shots!

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Young! Serve 'em out the Range Rover (Range Ro')
I swear my Rollie stay shining like a rainbow (skee!)
I took that money machine, filled it with hella green (green)
You be shining like I sprayed you with some oil sheen
DC Young Fly, now what the fuck you mean? (fuck you mean?)
Young said he Seen It All, now what the fuck ya'll seen? (ay!)
Left the club in a Wraith, came in a helicopter
David Beckham, way I kick it like I'm playing hella soccer
I turn the valet to a helipad (helipad)
Nigga straight walk up in the bitch like I'm Nino
From the coat on my back, to the shoes on my feet (what, what)
Everything on me Valentino ('tino! ooh!)
I'm talkin' Boyz N Da Hood, went solo, nigga (solo, nigga)
Testarossa back then, ex-Polo nigga
Niggas still on my dick, what you a homo, nigga?
When you sayin' my name, it's free promo, nigga!
What! Look!

[Chorus: T.I. & Jeezy]
If it ain't about the money
Don't be blowin' me up, nigga I ain't gettin' up
If it ain't about the... Look!
If it ain't about the money
Ain't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time
Look, you bitch ass niggas
If it ain't about that check, nigga
If it ain't about the money
Nah I can't even hear what you say, I ain't finna do shit
Ain't finna do shit!
If it ain't about the money (Hustle Gang, nigga!)
Bitch, you can miss me with it, bitch nigga miss me with it
Bitch, you can miss me with it! Look, turn! Hey!
Turn up!

[Verse 2: T.I. & Young Thug]
What you think I'm standin' in the trap for? (why?)
With the fully automatic at the back door
'Cause when it's on, know it's on, call me King Corleone (ooh!)
I'mma keep it 1000 like a crack ounce
Give a damn if I'm flat broke (nah!)
I'm filthy rich, I'm still the same, that's a fact though
Oh yeah, we all about the money, nigga
All you got is money when my name hold weight like a fat ho
I can never join in the game 'less I'm capo
Milkin' these niggas even though I'm fuckin' lactose
Take off on the cops, Mama said, "Don't look back, bro"
I'm in New York and I'm ballin' just like a Net, though
I'm drinkin' bubblegum pink like Pepto
Bismol, bet she wanna come through
And get low, I'ma be with Haitians
All my Zos, Tip tell these niggas, bro
Bankroll Mob, yeah, we on, we retarded
I'ma give you 15 from the carbine (turn it!)
Hit you in the leg, in your head, then your face
When you dead, bet ya I'ma take your place on the Forbes list
So better miss with that bullshit, partner
I'll be hopping out your bushes with a full clip, got 'em (got 'em!)
I'll take a big stick to a fuck nigga neck (nigga neck!)
Swinging at it, kind of like a piñata

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I'm a beast with the choppa, I'm the same without it
Graduated from the lean, that's my alma mater
Um! Shoot 'em in his head, he say, "Look at my roof!"
No sticks, no seeds, only kush in my kush
Make a nigga commit suicide and call it a selfie
I get M's like mmm-mmmm-mmm
I'm an asshole, I'm full of myself
You get an asshole full of my foot
They find your ass in the woods when they look
And these hoes ain't as good as they look
I need to take my own advice though
Cause if the pussy good then I'm good
Where your ghetto pass, nigga? I been big since a little-ass nigga
You little-ass nigga, you don't get a pass, nigga
Started as a middle-class nigga
When I blew up, I ain't even hear the blast, nigga (woo!)
I was chillin', smokin' on the loud
Focused on the future, but I need my money now
Don't give me the runaround
Upstairs in my mansion, knock-knock, "Who's there?"
I ain't even comin' down if it ain't about the money

[Chorus: T.I. & Lil Wayne]
If it ain't about the money (Yeah!)
Don't be blowin' me up, nigga I ain't gettin' up (Tune!)
If it ain't about the money
Ain't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time
If it ain't about the money (about the money)
Nah I can't even hear what you say, I ain't finna do shit
Ain't finna do shit, my nigga!
If it ain't about the money
Bitch, you can miss me with it, bitch nigga miss me with it
Turn up! (Remix, baby!)

[Verse 4: Young Thug]
I get money on a very rainy day (and!)
I would love to spray your face with Olay, aye
No computer cause she never wanted space, aye
I swear lil' mama is the weirdest in the place, ayy
I'm a big G, dinosaur B
You know, YSL takin' over streets
I'm a K-Ci, where is Jodeci?
I'ma treat em' bad like he supposed to be
I'm a blood, nigga, don't try to approach me
Girl, let's hit like Kobe and Ginobili
If them not Gucci earmuffs, you can't ignore me
Her booty piped up like a circus, baby, show me
I might just take off on that broad 'cause she don't know me
Dej Loaf, change that beef to macaroni
No scale, but my bitches say I'm bony
Lil mama still blushing at the old me (woo!)

[Verse 5: T.I.]
Nigga, Thug in the Impala, whole Hustle Gang follow
Coming from a hundred thousand to another million dollars
You finna fuck around and get yo ass whooped, dawg (bow!)
We send ya bullets bout the size of a football
I got a youngin' with a shottie, charge a hundred for a body
I’ll pay that to watch a monkey fuck a football, ayo!
Units of the yayo, since I was a day old
Uncle taught me say, "Hasta luego" if it ain’t about the money!

[Outro: Sample]
Fatality
This nigga is my bro... Meek cool  like shit.. can't get this nigga off me. Meek Milly for l baby
Ife

[Verse 1]
We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better
We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

[Verse 2]
We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker
He can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace (Ahh)
We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up, then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But honey, most of them are true
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing (Yeah) to get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Oh-oh
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
So, come on, come along with me
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
The best people in life are free
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)

[Bridge]
Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing, and
Please leave me stranded
It's so romantic (It's so romantic)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Breakdown]
'Cause baby, I could build a castle (Oh, baby, I could build a castle)
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
But every night with us is like a dream (Is like a dream)

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, I could build a castle (Castle)
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free
So over the years, a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end
How long does it take, where do you write, what are the circumstances, do you start with music, do you start with lyrics, and my answer is always that it happens differently every time, and that's why I'm still so in love with song writing
So what I've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started, different ways
So I'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how I put songs together

I sent this voice memo to Ryan Tedder because I'd always wanted to work with him, and finally we scheduled some studio time
So I always wanna be prepared
I wanted to send him the idea that I was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said "I can't stand that, I wanna work on something else, think of something else"
So I just sat down with the piano, put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where I wanted to go with the song, how I saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called "I Know Places"
So this was the voice memo I sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song

"Okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing:

Uh-uh-uh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i-i-i

Na na na na waiting at the back door
They're around and the vultures come around
And you know that they won't, they won't us
Say what they want 'bout, say what they want 'bout us
And you come and sing and listen
I would not think about it but I'm not done
Every know that a thing or two about it, thing or two about it, I
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters we are the foxes
And we run

Baby, I know some places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

Uh-uh-uh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, oh-oh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, know places"

Or whatever
I don't know, but that's basically just like a dark, really dark lyric, like, bridge thing and it's about, like, everybody's, like, trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever, and it's like you just, whatever, you know, and the chorus would just go to that major and just be like ooh chorus
So I hope you like it, it wouldn't be a piano thing
It would be, like, 

[*vocalizing*]
Like, very, like, beat. Now I'm just making weird sounds
Hope you like it!
This is another way I've written songs recently
This is a song I did with Jack Antonoff, and Jack is one of my friends and so we're hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes "I made this amazing track the other day. It's so cool, I love these guitar sounds."
And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said "Please, please let me have that. Let me play with it, like send it to me"
And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called "I Wish You Would", because Jack wrote back and said "I love that"
So this is another way of writing, it's writing to track:

Okay so this is an idea called "I Wish You Would". It's kind of about this guy who's like, he's driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriend's house and it's like, he thinks she hate him, but she's still in love with him, very dramatic. This track is sick, hope you like this

It's 2 am, in your car
Windows down, past my street the memories start
It's in the past
You drive straight ahead
You thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
Do you like it!?
Arrrrre yooooou reeeaaadyyy!?

This place inside my mind, a place I'd like to hide
You don't know the chances.. What if I should die?
A place inside my brain, another kind of pain
You don't know the chances.. I'm so blind
Bliiiiind
Bliiiiind

Another place I find, to escape the pain inside
You don't know the chances.. What if I should die?
A place inside my brain, another kind of pain
You don't know the chances.. I'm so blind
Bliiiiind
Bliiiiind

Deeper and deeper and deeper is all I'm turning to
Living a life that seems to be, a lost reality
That can never find, a way to reach my inner
Self-esteem is low, how deep can I go?
In the ground that I lay, if I don't find a way to
See through the grey that clouds my mind
This time I look to see what's between the lies
I can't see, I can't see
I'm going blind
I'm going blind
I'm going blind
I'm going blind
I'm going blind
I'm going blind
I'm going blind
I'm going blind
I'm going blind
I'm going blind
I'm going blind
I'm going blind
I'm going blind
I'm blind
I'm blind
I'm blind
I'm blind

We be clubbing, we be clubbing, we be clubbing
I'm in the city bitch, we clubbing (Nigga, what?)

Taking out the residential global persperation
Freaky gyrations close to fornication
Numbers get passed when asked information
Intoxication faded inebriated
Designated driver liver than Macgyver
Blocking freaks in all of 'em tens
Stallions get them to pile in
Sitting on 'lacs, bitch, we write raps
Backdo' access you getting jealous
Standing all in line with designer umbrellas
Bad fellas running with the East Side connection
Any kind of club with a star check they weapons
Who wanna sex DMX? Get naked

Them slugs you spit at me now, get at me if you want more
Put a fucking hole up in yo' back so what's the front for?
Come on baby we some noisemakers
Catching niggas with bricks at out of Montego
Coming through Las Vegas
Made us wanted dead or alive
On mad niggas hit lists
But ain't a motherfucker come to get this
Witness what's unheard of cold blooded murder
This hot shit'll have you smelling like a fucking burger
And the shell from the twelve is all it takes
To make a nigga spin like twice and then fall
You call for help
But ain't none coming
The admin slaughtered the robbery & gun running
And when I'm done gunning we all gon' meet up at the club
Fucking with Cube it's nothing but love
Nigga, what!!

[Chorus: Ice Cube]
Heavy hitters counting figures
We be clubbing
Mixing blunts and heavy liquors

If the dog's in the ring then the dog's gonna fight (Roof)
If the dog's on the west coast then I'm fucking with Cube
Where them hoes at nigga keep 'em coming in twos
Like Noah I make it wetter the doubleheader
Hit that ass like I got a vendetta you know it's better
With the don mega shake it off shake it off

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Uh, uh, uh
Ja's the torture, the high class, toss to D
Grimy and gritty, outter limits in this inner city
Niggas is definately assed-out, fuckin wit me
End up with a gun in your mouth, straight cheese
I should bust 'em, cuz' see me killing you don't mean nothing
I'll put you through a lifetime of sufferin nigga
Then you'll learn that bridges ain't made to be burned
Drug money is rightfully earned, well deserved
Some rules just think, are fit for takes
And Ja's rules make em large, that you fatefully break
Unless you wanna get spanked, with the 9 fully loaded
We can murder each other, meet at the Crossroads
And if I die tonight, in the immortal words of Pac
My niggas gonna hunt you till you drop, believe that
Niggas is capable of all that, take your mom for ransom
Give little kids back, that's the way we do things
Never leave shells, never drop names
Roll with the game as it change
Ja's to blame, I'ma let this world share my pain
In my demise you can put it on my grave
"Here lies a lost soul of rage, seen brighter days
And outta darkness done graduated, may he lay"
And this I swear, here in Hell we don't play fair
Cross the line, with my nine I'll be bringin you here
Motherfuckers
Check it out y'all
Check it out, check it out
Check it out y'all
Check it out, check it out
Check it out y'all
Check it out, check it out
Check it out y'all

[Verse 2: DMX]
Uh, grrrrrrrrrrrr!
I make moves that get me where I'm going
Break fools that act like they ain't knowing how it's going
Dizown, with the dizark, cuz' that's that kid
Unmask that kid, look at that bastard kid
That don't mind having to break shit or take shit
And motherfucker, if you ain't me you ain't shit
You fucking faggot
You know I coulda been stuck it to you
Nigga I wasn't even think about fucking with you
But I bet now I know your man is thinking twice bout who to fuck with
Shit is getting bad, I'm robbing niggas I grew up with
And I know it's just a matter of time before I get shot
Or I'ma torture this niggas little sister and make him watch
Give a nigga a little room, now he's trying to house shit
But I bet you get back on some mouse shit
When I punch you in your mouth, bitch
Aaaah, a nigga broken off quick
Yelllckkk! (gagging sound), is the sound he makes choking off dick
How you feel, eating with a straw he has to suck through
Fuck me? No fuck you, now I gotta touch you
Fucking bitch sucking dick like a jockstrap
Put them Glocks back
Trying to be the first punk motherfucker that shot back
Got that? didn't get? You know where you gonna be laying right?
I'm telling you Ahk you know what the fuck I'm saying right?
You will respect this, cuz' it gets reckless when I cut the
Dun-nun-dun-nun-dun-nun-dun-nun, you be like "What the--Nooo!"
But it's too late cuz' the heat-seaker done found the heat
The concrete done found your meat
Cuz hittin the ground still hot from steam coming off
Eyes rolled back in his head, coughing up chunks of flesh
Then niggas'll roll with his monstrous death, beating punks to death
Ain't nothing left but the memory of what used to be your life
Funeral payments, and dried up blood on my knife
Y'all motherfuckers don't understand, when it's on it's on
You up in the casket with some shades, cuz' your eyes is gone
I know I'm wrong, that's why I did my dirt and slid
But you made it happen, with that bullshit you did
Now you want peace? Well take a piece of this ammunition
And get your ass drug out the Hudson by some old man fishing
My mission is almost complete
This message will self destruct in two seconds
Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeep
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats goin' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats goin' shed blood for me
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us

DMX verse..
If I'm gonna rob I'm a rob all night
If I'm lookin' for somethin' it's probably a fight
If I'm goin' fuck bitches then they better be tight
If that's dead, then the head better be right
If I gots to play I'm a play till I win
Since I gots to be here can't wait to begin
Wanna fuck shorty can't stand shorty friend
'Cuz honey friend fuck many, many men
Stay wit' the rats 'cuz the rats is real
Wanna fuck? Then we fuck already know the deal
Shit, fuck what you look like just show the real
Then I keep spot that we can go to chill
I Love life, get down for the hoes
Only reason I come round is for the hoes
Life works, I play it down for the hoes
Hit em off wit that dark brown you kno?
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats goin' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats goin' shed blood for me
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us

Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats goin' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats goin' shed blood for me
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us

Drag-On verse

You fucking wit' me ain't keeping your health right
'Cuz me and my dogs we keep it gelled tight
The shit I pack is heavy but the shells light
When they drop the same time you drop without a fight
Burning anything that I'm putting my name on
You might take a Drag but you can't flame On
I know y'all niggas don't know me wit' a chain on
When it come to the fire I'm the kid they blame it on
When you see like eight cars then y'all know where we are
Niggas spitting mean bars off the green jar
Never drunk but you see me limp at the bar
Spit fire that'll melt the ice on your arm
You had that but for now dog give me that
'Cuz y'all you don't wanna see how my simmy act
Fake hustling niggas you'll pump any pack
When it come to this shit I done laid plenty flat
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats goin' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats goin' shed blood for me
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us

Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats goin' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats goin' shed blood for me
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us
Do you hear wat I tell you, understand wat u hear
Don't let nobody tell you wat to hope and to fear
Don't let nobody tell you wat to hope and to fear

What you niggas want? 'Cuz I got it right here
Y'all niggas front then I hit you right there
Not really impressed by what niggas wear
Faggots talk shit but I really don't care
I'm the type of nigga that'll die for the cause
Fuck what you heard I will die for my dogs
Ain't scared of shit will ride in the fog
Same thing but a bigger size than yours
I fuck with Drag-On 'cuz he spits the flame
Drag-On motherfucker don't forget the name
And we all taking over ain't shit the sa
If you ain't out that mob nigga quit the game
And
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats goin' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats goin' shed blood for me
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us

Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats goin' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats goin' shed blood for me
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us
Y'all niggas is dead, dead!
What the fuck is wrong with y'all?
Face illest street niggas, illest rap niggas
It's murda!

Motha fuckers wanna kill me but don't got the heart
To look me in the eyes with the nine and spark
Cause whether your for or against this
When I spit with murderous intentions, everybody goes everybody knows
The weapons I possess they not for show
And you put dresses on your weapons when you walk out the door
See once I flash mother fuckers better do the one shot dash
Or be one shot ass
J to the A-Y to the drive by to your hood screamin bye-bye to you

Yo, shit I hope ya'll niggas know to lay low now
Cause thou shall perish if you don't bow down
Cause I hit em on sight, its dark dim the lights
You shot twice god bless to this the night
That alot of niggas fear the coming of their life
And you dead right be in hell looking for ice
F**kin with Ja you bitch niggas talking shit
All on my dick you broke niggas making me rich
You gonna blaze me cause you high ripped off the henne rock
Flow semi-hot handling me your not
Check my forte not even on a bad day you beat this
Rather beat your dick or your bitch
My flow be the sick shit, gravely ill
Niggas dying cause they know I spit like iron, nothing but bark flyin
Flows and mics, hell and night, go together like heaven and light
Niggas ain't seein my plight
I'm a cruddy nigga, goin' up raw-dog in dirty bitches
And if I get burnt, I'm givin that shit to thirty bitches
You say you know a nigga like me, guess again Poppy
I might smile up in your face but I ain't your friend Poppy
Jump out the fifteen hundred like runnin, niggas don't want it
Get it, Done it, when I'm blunted
However it went down, I made it happen, I made it scrapin'
I made it fussin, bustin, I made it cappin
And lettin off wasn't nothing new to a nigga
Something to do to a nigga, Cause you is a fool nigga
I know your type, you hype, all up off that fake shit
You can't understand why a man would have to take shit
Or steal shit, but this is that real, niggas kill shit, peel shit
I hit you in your head you won't feel shit!!!
GRRRR.....
Let the dogs lose on a niggas ass
Find out if the niggas faster then the trigger's blast
A fucking snake in the truest form
Knowin' damn well that what I do is wrong, but still I do it strong
Niggas is making movies so i gots to stop production
I need a block to function and maybe I'll stop destructin
These blocks are not for frontin', So let me get that shorty
Cause you don't need that shorty
You don't know what to do with that shorty
You might as well hit this 40, before you hit the floor
Another 24, What you want, Money, More!?!
Since we gots to rob something its definitely gonna be worth it
Inside job lettin you peep from the surface
But can a nigga live
Hold me down and I gotcha
I'd hate to have on my conscience that I shot ya
With out you I wouldn't be here
So lets get doe together
But first you got to let me know if you with yo whatever
Is you bustin off or is you just holdin a gun
When you should be here are you there rollin a blunt
My ribs is touchin
I need this little bit of money more than you think
That who think two niggas would think two hours could hit two banks
Is you ready for the big time
This is a big crime that I'm commiting
And I'm sure there'll be casualties because this time is slippin
But I'm forgettin what I'm there for
It's all about the money
Fuck how many lives are lost
It's all about the money
And ain't nuthin funny about the brains on the walls
Come on, load up the truck get it all
(Ain't nuthin' funny, but still don't nuthin move but the money)
I gots to make a move and make it soon
(Ain't nuthin' funny, but still don't nuthin move but the money)
Yo I gots to take a block and make it boom
(Ain't nuthin' funny, but still don't nuthin move but the money)
I gots to make a move and make it soon
(Ain't nuthin' funny, but still don't nuthin move but the money)
Yo I gots to take a block and make it bloom

Yo this banks perfectly fitted for dues like us to hit it
X, Masta I.C., you know I'm wit it
Never felt remours when a wit got splitted
Huh, its money involved so lets go get it
I know ya niggas coppin shit loud
The get away cars to kill when it's time to get wild
Down the conner rollin sparkin the beef
I want the heat
And them fellas fars up the same chalkin sheet
They know how I get down X, when they flex
Force me to put something hot in they chest
I lay to rest
The transcretion from the door
My four four (?) when I'm on war
One floor
And that's it we history
And I can't have Diamond and Rob forgettin me
It's all enough to like Joe
Fuck that and we all know god it ain't nuthin like dough
Yeah, yeah, yo
Ain't nothin funny but still don't nothin move but the money
(Ain't nothin funny, ain't nothin funny)

And every bitch you grabbed, Sheek bend em back

[Verse Two: Jadakiss]
Ayo I hope you ain't tongue-kissin your spouse

Jada, if I kiss you now, you'll die later

Ready to clap, everybody givin me that
Cause believe it or not, we be the ones settin the traps
You listen to y'all hits, then listen to our hits

Cause everytime I turn around y'all on the L.O.X. dick

I be the D-R, A-G, dash O-N, slash often Comma
Burnin niggas often, they call me Drag-On, I'm hot scorchin
Keep the block roastin Light a dutch wit the flames comin, toastin
In my eyes you could see what summer's holdin
Realizin, every guy I'll fry or dead rowdy
I burn to a degree of 130, and my gun dirty
Cause it got one bury, so you better run, hurry Or catch one early
You wrong, tryin to touch me, what type of shit you on?
You better through your boots on and your unflammable suits on
Cause I'm comin through wit a Yukon Black tinted wit gats in it
Catch you while you smokin, send your casket
Throw the sack in it
But only half of it, cause y'all like half-ass dude
And we are one whole, and y'all niggas is one slash two
My gun blast you, tryna out the flames, what're you, firemen?
You'll catch a hell of a Backdraft cause my fire retirin, aight then

[Verse Six: DMX]
It's my, survival instinct that keeps my head above the water
Everyday I show another how a lover slaughter
Flood your daughter, full of more holes than spurges
Taxin businessmen for stocks over lunches
Wit these, I shoot the breeze, and extort
Enough keys from the Cuban, to build a fuckin fort
Caught up in somethin that I can't control
Tryna get a hold of a bankroll, let's role
Catch bodies like a cold, and I stay slick so face it
Make me chase it, I take your life and erase it
Wasted, in the fuckin streets cause it ain't worth shit
The undertaker take your ass under the earth quick
I Love money, but the scrambles hot
So i snatch up my man and the gamblin spot
Twenty grand is got, when niggas shot, one nigga less
What used to be his chest is now a mess under his fuckin vest

[Verse 1]
Please forget the words that I just blurted out
It wasn't me, it was my strange and creeping doubt
It keeps rattling my cage
And there's nothing in this world will keep it down

[Chorus]
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't

[Verse 2]
So many things that keep, that keep me underground
So many words that I, that I can never find

[Bridge]
If you give up on me now
I'll be gutted like I've never been before

[Chorus]
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't

[Bridge]
If you give up on me now
I'll be gutted like I've never been before

[Chorus]
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Yo dog!
Yeah?
Can you hit em with some of that X shit?
Some of that X shit?
Some of that real X shit!
Let's do it, baby

Dog nigga! (what? what?
What? What? What? What?)
Dog nigga!
(Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh!) Ruff Ryders!
Volume one (volume one!), Swizz Beats (come on! come on! come on!)
All aboard!

If I thought y'all niggas really wanted drama
I'da been pulled out the armor, word to my momma
I'ma -- hit y'all niggas with somethin that you ain't never felt
Hit y'all niggas for frontin you caught up in that hell
If I thought that half the shit that bitches said was true
I'd be spitting lead at you, to dead your crew
But -- if you know a bitch, you don't listen to that bitch
You don't argue with that bitch, all you do is
(Man: fuck that bitch!)
If I listened to all the snake niggas that's runnin they mouth
I wouldn't be in the crib, I'd be loadin up, to run in your house
But -- you can't fuck with cowards, cause a coward'll be a coward
He'll end up killin these cowards, and I'm not feelin these cowards!
If I let the niggas around my way tell me how to feel about me
I guess I really, wouldn't be d
But I'm the best that ever did it, the best at it because I live it
How many niggas eat it and shit it, you cats want it? come and get it!
Grrr, arf arf, woo woo!
Grrr, arf arf, woo woo!
Tell me how you feelin now (what?!) I know you illin now (what?!)
Tell me how you feelin now (what?!) I know you illin now (what?!)
Grrr, arf arf, woo woo!
Grrr, arf arf, woo woo!
Tell me how you feelin now (what?!) I know you illin now (what?!)
Tell me how you feelin now (what?!) I know you illin now (what?!)

It's not like me...
Where you at, baby?

There's a lot of motherfuckers in here, dog

Is it on? (Crowd: YEAH!)
Is it on? (Crowd: YEAH!)
IS IT ON? (Crowd: YEAH!)

C'mon! Uh! C'mon! What?
Is y'all motherfuckers ready for the ruff ryde!

When I speak I'm understood, my decision is wood
See what I'm able to see, 'cause my vision is good
It's like I see through the eyes of a wise old man
So I chill, and when I can kill this guy's whole fam
Something better to be thought dumb and remain silent
Then to open your mouth and remove (?) 'cause if it came violent
See I'm gonna give it to you straight, so you don't ask anymore
You don't really want what you
(Man: Asking me for)
It's a war when it's on it's on, when I'm long
Till I'm gone and I ain't got long
But while I'm here, y'all niggas gonna burn
Be (?) after this money and y'all niggas gonna learn
All this fucking weak you've been talking about that driveby
And they did nothing but
(Man: Driveby's)
Listen shorty I'm telling you this for your own good
Everybody is the man in they own hood, for real
Do my ladies run this motherfucka? (YEAH!)
Or do my dogs run this motherfucka? (YEAH!)
Do my ladies run this motherfucka? (YEAH!)
Or do my dogs run this motherfucka? (YEAH!)
Uh-huh!
I don't hear you!
I don't hear you!
Arf arf arf! Arf! Arf!

[Verse 1]
In my mind
And nailed into my heels
All the time
Killing what I feel

[Chorus]
And everything I touch
(All wrapped up in cotton wool)
(All wrapped up in sugar-coated pills)
Turns to stone
And everything I touch
(All wrapped up in cotton wool)
(All wrapped up in sugar-coated pills)
Turns to stone

[Verse 2]
I am fused
Just in case I blow out
I am glued
Just in case I crack out

[Chorus]
And everything I touch
Turns to stone
Everything I touch
(All wrapped up in cotton wool)
(All wrapped up and sugar-coated)
Turns to stone

[Instrumental]
Mmmmm... Mmmm...
See y'all don't understand us you know
Ruff ryderz is a family
Ruff ryderz....ruff ryderz...ruff ryderz
Lets go...Swizz!!

Uh
This is the darkest shit, sparkest shit
Hittin wit the hardest shit, cuz before we started shit (uh!)
Wit kidz I knew my fuckin friendz all turned against me (what?)
Said fuck it, bought me a dog ever since me and my dog has been like this
He got my back I got his, schemin on mad niggas (what?)
Dats how we do bidz (uh!)
It's about time to start another, robbin spree
Cuz yo, my way is highway, robbery
When I was up north since 16 I was sendin niggas home in a coffin (what?)
Livin like a orphan, you bad nigga? (what?)
I'll be back to see if you'll be still here
You know my style will put yo fuckin man, in a wheelchair (c'mon!)
He'll never walk again, on the strength of me
Dats how I left him g, scared to death of me
Niggas cannot run, (woooh!) hit wit da hot one
From the shotgun, catz was close wondered how we got done...
Yo yo, e-v-e
My dogz believe in me
Petty thugz hide yo cake, never teasin me
I show love to, all my bitches hustlin one'z, tussle wit these
Makin moves, second to none, I locked it, huh
Made a sudden move you got bit
Flooded wit the double r, real street shit
Da blond hair bandit, you got gunz, hand it
Turn my face when I bust a cannon
Cuz I don't wear sunblock
Ask drag if the fire is hot (flame on baby)
Shit pop shellz, fall three feet, roll over and stop
We warn niggas that we comin, then we total the block
We scorn niggas like they mothers, then we wet up they socks
Red dot, excapin on a radar, to seashore, then hide out
And buy out bars till we see far
In this game, we beat y'all, you got money?
Keep y'alls, for us be tearin tryin to hide, then tear out fire
Beat y'alls

Uh, nah, yo, uh, uh, yo, yo
And you can come see me if you tryin to get some
Fuck rap yo, I'd rather be plannin the flights
Somewhere hot on a wave runner, tanning wit dykes
Blowin the haze, while all of em givin me brains
One at a time, y'all start from the front of the line
But everybody wanna contact me, and get wit me
And still end up bein mad cuz I charge 50
And as for you suckaz, you can keep those rapz
And screw yo awardz, my son can't eat those plaques
I never was shipped but some thingz I never forget
Like if you spent three you garanteed to make back six
Drove the benz off the lot and just dusted her off
Tints, rims, stashed, tick the governer off
Even the catz that be hatin still be lovin the dogz
Cuz they know that the double r's comin for war
Wha
Uh-huh
You ain't ready to die, then why should you live?
Cuz when I start bustin the gunz you hidin the kids
And the pieer's still ridin wit clips, survivin wit bricks
We beefin on the 4th you got to die on the 5th
Like I wasn't hustlin dope or robbin the blocks
Starvin or not, carvin the cheek, palmin the Glock
I figure which nigga could I watch wit a watch
I like to knock off my crack then I pull off a heist
Put it together, double it twice this shit is my life
Catch me wit a .45, hot pair of nikes
And three red dice, like, give me the bank or gimmie yo face
Gimmie a shank it's holiday(uh)
The hooptie's in the front but the truck is a mile away
Niggas wanna ride tommorow when they'll probabaly die today
Cuz da pio'll hollow the gunz
Then holla at son (I feel you nigga)
And when he go to holla back, niggas swallowin one

Uh
Y'all dem bust in them crowd niggas and hit whoever
When you should aim for them niggas that took yo leather
They right there, but you scared that they gon bust
Cause they crazy, but crazy niggas bleed like us
See I'm one shot thru the heart like cupid
Y'all niggas might be crazy, but y'all not stupid
It's 99, I'm killin you, woman and kid
Fuck scarface, watch me, I'm mo action to see
Than the muthafuckaz that y'all see on t.v
And fuck what you heard, check how sheek get down
Comes the gun, shit, I'm rhymin wit one on me now
You neva know, what clown could walk in the studio
Talkin shit, and there's gon be more than the amps that blow
I'll pour gas on yo skin and watch yo shit detach
Wit a book of matches, now dats when you met yo match
And the worst thing for you is for me to have a gun when I'm thirsty
I'll turn niggas more holy man, than eddie murphy
And I deal wit mo bricks than that city do in jersey
I got call cops niggas, I got autops niggas, that'll bust you and slide
Wit some of 6-drop niggas
Revolver pop niggas, easy ox niggas, get knocked
Say I smoked detox niggas
Drug program, hit the streetz and cop 56 mo gramz
Y'all niggas ain't fuckin wit the fam and dats word
Hey yo boy, what's the difference between fire and water?
You whether drown or die off torture, cause yo skins of ya
And watch ya burn off fat, dog I'm off the thermostat
Could put a comb to my mouth and give yo bitch a perm wit that
Keep shellz in the envelopes cuz I'll mail out bullets
More blood that a riot on a jailhouse footage
Buck 40, got a extra 20 wit the semi, when it hit you
You gon do a 360 pretty swiftly
When I burn you to a crisp you gon be crunchier than chips
Wit my hand all up in the bag, munchin on this shit
Bit by bit, clip by clip and every block by block is brick on brick
So I got knots on knots, got thingz that'll pop yo top
And double r spot yo block wit 16 shots and watch y'all drop
And ain't nobody gettin up, lest they in the wheelchair
Sittin up or spittin up, either way I don't give a fuck
Oh oh, what have they done now?
I want everybody who can see me, to put ya motherfuckin Xs in the air!
Grrr... You Know!
When the dog is on the stage!
C'mon baby!
Y'all niggas gots to make mo motherfuckin noise to that!
C'mon! What? C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!
What? C'mon!
Now bounce! Bounce! Now bounce! Now bounce! Bounce! Bounce! Bounce! Bounce!
(DMX)
Grrr... Grrr... Grrr...
What? What? What?

One two one two, come through run through
Gun who, oh you don't know what the (gun do!)
Some do, those that know are real quiet
Let me think you wanna try it, fuck around and (start a riot!)
Niggas gonna buy it, regardless because I'm the
Hardest rap artist and I'ma start this
Shit up for real, get up and feel, my words
I make herbs split up (and squeal)
Ill is all I've been hearin lately
Niggas hate me, wanna duck tape me and make me
Put their brains on the wall, when I brawl
Too late (for that 911 call)
Niggas stay beefin' but a lot of them bluffin'
But not me because I'm a nigga that can get out of them cuffs
You think a lot of them tough, just for frotin', when I hit them niggas
Like ('what you want?'), the battle turns into a hunt
With the dog right behind niggas chasin' 'em down
We all knew that you was pussy, but I'm (tastin' it now)
And never give a dog blood because raw blood have a dog like
(What?) bitin' whatever all up in ya gut
Give it to them raw like that, and ain't no love I do em
All like that, four right up in they back (clack clack)
Close your eyes baby, it's over, forget it
Happened in front of your buildin' but nobody knows who did it

[Verse 1]
Soul destroyed with clever toys for little boys
It's inevitable, inevitable, it's a soul destroyed

[Chorus]
You're free until you drop
You're free until you've had enough
But you don't understand
You've no ripcord, no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord

[Verse 2]
Aeroplane, do I mean what I mean?
It's inevitable, inevitable, oh aeroplane

[Chorus]
A thousand miles an hour
And politics in power
That you don't understand
You've no ripcord, no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord
The answer to your prayers
We'll drop you anywhere
With no ripcord, no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord
That "t" would help though
Here we go again
Yeah, check it out, y'all
Check it out, check it out
Check it out y'all, check it out y'all
It's funk flex,  DMX (x4)
Straight Y.O. mother fuckers

[verse 1]
Now days cats and middleman, little man, ain't controlling shit
Talk about holding bricks, but ain't holding dick
Niggas talk real slick, but that's about it
Soon as I see 'em headed my way, I cut them off quick
Must you beat me in my head everytime I come through?
It's shit like, everybody tells me I sound just like you
But you not me, got me? and you can't live without me
If I wasn't DMX, you wouldn't give a fuck about me
Ain't about "dog I wanna be just like you"
How about you wanting to be just like you?
You can do what I do, just in your own way
Shit, I get niggas that ride dick every f**kin' day (i-ight? )
If you got talent, talent is yours, it can't be mine
And it take you where it's gon' take you, it'll be fine
Let me hit 'em with the rewind
Do you and I'll do me
To me you'll see how real you'll be

[hook (x2)]
Do you - 'cause what it boils down to it's true
Do you - 'cause you are held accountable for you
Do you - is that really what you want me to see
Do you - 'cause I'mma do me, truley, woohee

Do you - 'cause what it boils down to, it's true
Do you - 'cause you are held accountable for you
Do you - is that really what you want me to see
Do you - 'cause I'mma do me, truley

[Verse 2]
Hey yo dog, I got lyrics
Hey yo dog, I got beats (word)
Damn, is this the type of shit I gots to put up with in the streets?
Used to be able to walk, not have to talk to nobody
Everywhere I go it's like I bring the whole party
It ain't about tryin' to follow or tryin' to be like
But if we all see it through the eyes of the lord, we can see a light (c'mon)
Just let me get a hold of the mic, I'll teach you a little something
A lot of good things will go wrong because of a little frontin'
Express yourselves, be who you are, umm umm, you're a shining star
You don't even know what you got inside
How the fuck you gon' find out, you keep wanting to ride
Ayo, I ain't gon' let it slide no more
You're best to go forth, do what you know
Can't do you, then what you flow for
You ain't gon' get there tryin' to be me, dog
Look through your eyes, see what you see

[hook]
Do you - 'cause what it boils down to it's true
Do you - 'cause you are held accountable for you
Do you - is that really what you want me to see
Do you - 'cause I'mma do me, truley, woo hee

[verse 3]
Like fuck it, you wanna be me? here's what you do
Grow up neglected by both parents and still pull through
You gots to come up fucked up, get treated like shit
Then have your mother's new boyfriend smack you like a bitch turn into a killer
Don't carry shottie
'cause the way it's goin' down right now, you gon' kill somebody
Get a dog, walk the streets, learn what you need to learn
Better have a cause but because you'll get burned
You got 15 years without ever coming out
And beat your fist at the world and what they talkin' about
Then get locked up every two years
For two years keep it real, hold back all tears, face your fears
Become a man before your time, rap but live out your rhymes
Let 'em know what's on your mind, then you'll get your shine
In time, everything you hear will come true
But you won't be doin' me, you'll be doin' you

[Hook (x4)]
Do you - 'cause what it boils down to it's true
Do you - 'cause you are held accountable for you
Do you - is that really what you want me to see
Do you - 'cause I'mma do me, truley, woo-hee
Niggas is dead, dead I tell you, can't be serious
What you think is gonna happen
With three of the illest niggas together
Street music and so fourth on one track,huh?
Can't be serious, it's murda nigga, huh, it's Murda

Motha f**kers wanna kill me but don't got the heart
To look me in the eyes with the nine and spark
Cause whether your for or against this
When I spit with murderous intentions, everybody goes everybody knows
The weapons I possess they not for show
And you put dresses on your weapons when you walk out the door
See once I flash mother f**kers better do the one shot dash
Or be one shot ass
J to the A-Y to the drive by to your hood screamin bye-bye to you
Why would you f**k with me
Knowing I put you six feet deep and them niggas could die wit'cha
Cock the hot pistol and pop the hot Cristal
And promise you only one thing, to not miss you
Jahova know the god that served ya
Cause dead or alive when I arrive it's Murda
Shit I hope ya'll niggas know to lay low now
Cause thou shall perish if you don't bow down
Cause I hit em on sight, its dark dim the lights
You shot twice god bless to this the night
That alot of niggas fear the coming of their life
And you dead right be in hell looking for ice
F**kin with Ja you bitch niggas talking shit
All on my dick you broke niggas making me rich
You gonna blaze me cause you high ripped off the henne rock
Flow semi-hot handling me your not
Check my forte not even on a bad day you beat this
Rather beat your dick or your bitch
My flow be the sick shit, gravely ill
Niggas dying cause they know I spit like iron, nothing but bark flyin
Flows and mics, hell and night, go together like heaven and light
Niggas ain't seein my plight, It's alright
I let the world know I shine like ice
I bet it all I can throw a hard four in the dice
Cause I'm a gambling man, you should gamble with a gat in your hand
Spin in barrel and put it to your head
Cause we don't dance no more all we do is cock and spit
Dedicated to giving you nothing but thug shit

Think we playing, you undoubtable fall further
F**kin with I N C is Murda
I'm a cruddy nigga, goin' up raw-dog in dirty bitches
And if I get burnt, I'm givin that shit to thirty bitches
You say you know a nigga like me, guess again Poppy
I might smile up in your face but I ain't your friend Poppy
Jump out the fifteen hundred like runnin, niggas don't want it
Get it, Done it, when I'm blunted
However it went down, I made it happen, I made it scrapin'
I made it fussin, bustin, I made it cappin
And lettin off wasn't nothing new to a nigga
Something to do to a nigga, Cause you is a fool nigga
I know your type, you hype, all up off that fake shit
You can't understand why a man would have to take shit
Or steal shit, but this is that real, niggas kill shit, peel shit
I hit you in your head you won't feel shit!!!
URRUURRRR.....
Let the dogs lose on a niggas ass
Find out if the niggas faster then the trigger's blast
A f**king snake in the truest form
Knowin' damn well that what I do is wrong, but still I do it strong
Niggas is making movies so i gots to stop production
I need a block to function and maybe I'll stop destructin
These blocks are not for frontin', So let me get that shorty
Cause you don't need that shorty
You don't know what to do with that shorty
You might as well hit this 40, before you hit the floor
Another 24, What you want, Money, More!?!
Them niggas did it raw, with no condom
You find em, sayin sorry he for what he said before I blind them
Get the flame out the four fifth, and there ain't gonna be no more riff
Dog you want a floss tiff, but would of made it to the door if
Bullets travled alot slower, and you ran alot faster
But they don't and you can't so don't think about after
Cause tomorrow ain't comin, so stop runnin
Cause you gonna die like a sucker
Murder Motherf**ker!!!
Uh!, where my mother f**king dogs at, Uh, Uh
My nigga Jigga, My dog Ja, Irv Gotti, Rough Riders, Def Jam
Where my dogs at, Top Fight Uh, Where my dogs at
Hold me down baby, Hold me down baby, Hold me down baby
Boomer One Love Nigga, URRUURRRR, Murda Motherf**ker..

[Intro]
Yeah (whoa)
I dropped a tear in the ocean eh
And when you find it
That's the day I'll stop loving you
C'mon

[Chorus]
If I have only one day on this earth whoa
I'll live tonight, I'll spend tonight, make love tonight
I'll sleep tonight with you by my side
And if I have only one day on this earth (whoa)
Then I'll laugh tonight, I'll cry tonight, I'll make it right
Spend the rest of my time with you by my side

[Verse 1]
If my time was slipping away
And I didn't have long to live
I'd appreciate the time we've shared
And I won't want you to shed a tear
If the road was coming to an end
And I couldn't turn this car around
I know faith will get us, get us through the wind
And I'll be somewhere on heaven's ground

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now if this life gets the best of me
And all the fame starts to fade away
Just know our love made history
And know that life is a better place
If there's nothing on the television
That the world was gonna end today
Girl I'll be on a mission
To love you the rest of the night away
If I had one

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
We could see the sunrise
We could see the stars bliss
Make love in the moonlight
I'll make you my bucketless
We gone shop like no tomorrow
Live it up like no tomorrow
Pop champagne like no tomorrow
In the club like no tomorrow
You can have anything you like
You're my girl I'm gonna treat you right
And when I shine you shine
So have fun you only get one night
And they all hating you
Diamond on you're face you behind and back
They wanna take your place
You can see no never ever
We gone run forever
We gone be together
Till forever and ever

[Chorus]

And I'm a motherfucking warrior according to the score
The 

[?] in there, your ho in there, your bro in there

[?] got a spot with so much weed, you gotta mow in there
We took 'em out, he had more in there
Kicked him up his ass with Jimmy Cha and Jimmy Cho in there
Bitches see me in that Honda Civic, want my digits
Want my ticket, they can't get it
They ain't get nothing but these kitties
It's impatient in the city got me frigid, but I'm getting it
It ain't on me, boy, it's in me
Spot just beatin just like Nitti
Get the bags out the trash can
See too much weed, I'm gon' spaz
Shotgun nino mash, YSL swag
Rock clad, I’m gon take his ass
One cap out no pass
We too bad, RIP to Spaz, free my nigga Nash, hey

[Chorus: MPA Wicced]
I live my life just like a warrior
And I’m a motherfucking warrior

And I’m a motherfucking warrior
I creep silent, I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent, I creep silent

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I live my life just like a warrior, I know that nigga up to something
He standing in the cold with no coat, catch a dime bag with an O and wipe your nose
Stay cold cause that pole on his throat
Hit the jeweler, leave out froze, my diamond blacker than coal
Her pussy dripping, all my pimping
I’m a hippy, know she with it
Get on the plane fuck up your city
My diamond’s bleeding, Wicced’s pissing
We going in just like Christmas
She on the stage showing her kitty
Thug tattooed on her titty, I look like a ton of midgets
Speaking of midgets, got a 

[?] if you want it, I'll go get it
Make one phone call to the bitches, they gon' pull up right here with it
We not worried 'bout no jacking, that's a ticket, no lieutenant
You know DK gonna squeeze it 'til it's empty

[Chorus: MPA Wicced]
I live my life just like a warrior
And I’m a motherfucking warrior
I live my life just like a warrior
And I’m a motherfucking warrior
I creep silent, I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent, I creep silent

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I live my life just like a warrior, my skin red like Seminoles
Speaking of red, my pen is sponsored by red bottoms
These bitches want everybody, my whole crew they got problems
They all 

[?] 'bout watches, they gon' kill that, we can’t stop them
We just looking like a profit in the club, they know we got it
Hit the club looking like Pac, we got muscles just like Rocky
Got all of these bitches bossin' for my bosses, plus your posse look like pasta
We gon' beat em, we gon' eat em, we gon' feed 'em to these divas
Yeah these divas run with heaters, senorita, hasta la vista
They two piece ya, then they leave, for your maker
No Anita, but I'm baking, lots of pizzas what I'm making

[?] cheetahs, I got acres sitting on acres, motherfucker

[Chorus: MPA Wicced]
I live my life just like a warrior
And I’m a motherfucking warrior
I live my life just like a warrior
And I’m a motherfucking warrior
I creep silent, I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent, I creep silent

[Intro]
(Dance, dance, dance, dance)
Fleek, fleek, fleek, fleek
(Dance, dance, dance, dance)
Fleek
(Dance, dance, dance, dance)

[Hook: B.o.B.]
Nigga got swag on fleek
Thumbin' through the money all week
Saw the cash then she got geeked, on fleek
Fleek, on fleek
Fleek, on fleek

[Verse 1: B.o.B.]
Every single thing on fleek, bitch
Fleekwood Mac that's me, bitch
Don't be askin' where the trunk at
The engine right behind the seat, bitch
Just hopped off the G6, snake skin belt from Egypt
One hand on the Bible, ask my homie Jesus
Aye, walked in with swag and the dope
Spillin' champagne, where my manners go?
If you ain't talkin' money I don't answer phones
She brought a nigga good weed and some dome
And I'm stoned, pockets fat that's Angie Stone
I stand alone, with a fleet like this I can't belong

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lin-Z]
Eyebrows stay on fleek, bitch
Get 'em done twice a week, bitch
Get ya nigga out my DM
Pussy game stay on fleek, bitch
Chanel bag match my feet, bitch
I ain't got time for broke hoes
Bitch you know those ain't your clothes
YOLO ho you so-so
R-red bone, yellow bone
Real hair, hella long
Loud weed, megaphone
Nails on fleek, Giuseppe's on
Bitches mad cause I'm on now
Panties matchin' my purses
Would fuck your nigga with your pussy
But he can't pay for these verses

[Hook]

[Verse 3: London Jae]
Designer jeans on me
Nigga tryna clone me
These bitches wanna bone me
Real shit, no bologna
Fleek
I paid a thousand dollars for these shades
You ain't got these, fleek
Rich niggas in the room, have a motherfuckin' seat
Fast car, bad ho
Big bankroll, can't even fold though
Clean as a whistle hoppin' out the four door
My bitch stay fleek, can't even control yours
Up all night, I'm taking NoDoz
If I ain't got none, I'm taking your ho
Two bitches at a time
Tell them hoes stay in line
And bring some more hoes, aye

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I can't sleep, I'm lonely
If only you were here to lay with me, lay with me
Long days, and longer nights don't feel right
If you're not here by my side, by my side
I'm thinking of running away
Into your arms to a place
Where I know that I'm gonna stay, gonna stay
People with so much to say
But I'm only hearing the words
That you left me with on that day, on that day

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I don't really care for
No, I don't really care for
Nobody but you
Nobody but you, baby, no
The only one I'm there for
No, I don't really care for
Nobody but you
Nobody but you, baby

[Chorus]
Nobody but you, you, you, you, you, you
Nobody but you, you, you, you, you, you

[Verse 2]
Lately, I'm faded, it's hazy
Won't you come and clear my mind, clear my mind
I won't be safe tonight
When you're the only comfort in my life, oh, in my life
I'm thinking of running away
Into your arms to a place
Where I know that I'm gonna stay, gonna stay

[Pre-Chorus] + 

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Nobody, nobody baby
Nobody, nobody baby
Nobody, nobody baby, baby, baby

[Pre-Chorus]

Nobody but you
I don't know who you are
But I clocked you from afar
And the kids on the streets said you're getting it from me

[Pre-Chorus]
You think you can kick the sand in my eyes
But you should walk a little softer
I hear you coming from a mile away
And you don't have enough to offer
Don't waste your time, playing with my mind
Or you'll regret it
I write the rules, for shame on you
You won't forget it

[Chorus]
You just follow, follow, follow
But tomorrow, morrow, morrow
When you're hollow, hollow, hollow
You'll be sad and all alone
Sad and all alone
Follow, follow, follow
But tomorrow, morrow, morrow
When the thrill is all dead and gone
You'll be sad and all alone
Sad and all alone

[Verse 2]
You can try to disguise
But you know deep in your heart
They can see in your eyes
That you're vacant in your heart

[Pre-Chorus]
You think you can kick the sand in my eyes
But you should walk a little softer
I hear you coming from a mile away
And you don't have enough to offer
Don't waste your time, playing with my mind
Or you'll regret it
I write the rules, for shame on you
You won't forget it

[Chorus]
You just follow, follow, follow
But tomorrow, morrow, morrow
When you're hollow, hollow, hollow
You'll be sad and all alone
Sad and all alone
Follow, follow, follow
But tomorrow, morrow, morrow
When the thrill is all dead and gone
You'll be sad and all alone
Sad and all alone

[Outro]
Give it all or give it nothing
Give it love or give it up
Give it all or give it nothing
Give it love or give it up
Give it all or give it nothing
Give it love or give it up
Give it all or give it nothing
Give it love or give it up
Give it all or give it nothing
Give it love or give it up
Give it all or give it nothing
Give it love or give it up
Give it all or give it nothing
Give it love or give it up
Give it all or give it nothing
Give it love or give it up
Give it all or give it nothing
Give it love or give it up
Give it all or give it nothing
Give it love or give it up
Give it all or give it nothing
Give it love or give it up
Give it all or give it nothing
Give it love or give it up
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up

[Intro]
Guys, I've got a lot of problems in my life. I wrote a song about some of the problems in my life, hope that some of you can relate to it. Here we go

[Verse 1]
Walkin' around, I've got no one to talk to
There's everyone, and then there's just me
If I could change, don't you think that I'd do it?
God only knows why he cursed me to be
A straight white man

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I state my problems
Other people roll their eyes
Three trips to the mall
Zero khakis in my size
I've never been the victim
Of a random search for drugs
But you can't say my life is easy
Until you've walked a mile in my UGGs

[Chorus 1]
Straight white man, I know the road looks tough ahead
The women want rights
The gays want kids, what?
Can't you just leave us alone?
And also, no to the things you asked for

[Post-Chorus]
They're being greedy and they know it, okay?

[Verse 2]
Everyone thinks that I've got it easy
And just 'cause it's true, doesn't mean that it's right
So pull up a chair, and put down your pitchforks
Give me a chance to show you what it is like
To be a straight white man

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The church has never made me
Feel ashamed of who I am
But I get e-mails from Zappos
That Gmail doesn't mark as spam
My country's Constitution
Was hand-written by my race
But my wife bought me the brand new iPhone
With an iPod Touch's case---case doesn't fit that phone

[Chorus 2]
Straight white man, I know the road looks tough ahead
The women want rights
The blacks want not to be called "the blacks," sorry
Can't you just leave us alone?
Also, no to the things you asked for
No

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus 3]
Straight white male, I know the road looks tough ahead
The women want rights
The African-Ameri---it doesn't work for the rhythm
We used to have all the money and land
And we still do, but it's not as fun now

[Spoken Outro]
Thank you
If you were offended by that, it was ironic. Isn’t that fun? I meant the whole opposite of it!

[Verse 1]
Who the fuck you think you fucking hollering at pops?
Talking disrespectful will get you shot on this block
He gon fuck around and have more fucking gut shots than 2Pac
So call the cops cause they gon whack you whether you call them or not
They call me Gucci Mane, Big Guwop, got more blocks than ibaka
And all my home boys got ten bricks up but I still hang with robbers
They say I got a warrant out for aggravated finessing
Next charge Imma get flexing with deadly intentions its gucci!
I’m in a Bentley on a Wednesday, same clothes, I been wearing this shit for 3 days
Fucking hoes, I ain’t bathe and I need to shave
I had a sun valley babe getting that section 8
Flat Shoals on the stove, not the microwave
And I ain’t never in my life had some finger waves
A big bad herringbone, I was catching J's
And I ain’t never in my life had some finger waves

[Intro]
Legend, legend, legend
It's Gucci, GuWop
A to the bay you know
East Atlanta

[Verse 1]
They tried to send your boy to rehab I didn't listen
First day out of rehab sent me to prison
Left the hospital man these crackers be trippin'
They said my diamonds was too crazy and I should be committed
If you ain't throw it out the truck why the fuck you plead guilty
Cause I'm the boy that cried wolf so they gone think that I did it
I took them 3 months to the chin then got back to the business
First day out of jail man I bought me a bentley
Me and Keyshia, smoking keisha cuz I’m handsome, she pretty
I got Ka'Oir lipstick all over me but stay out my business
R Kelly 12 Play home making love to a milli
Let’s make a tape, R Kelly-rated, yellow diamonds I'm pissin'

[Hook]
Shout out to 40, water, molly water, 3 different bitches
When you may Sprinkle Me Man, I swear to God I was pimpin'
When Jeezy first met me, man I swear to God I was trappin'
If you ain’t sent them cowards to me, then that shit would not happen
That shit would not happen
That shit would not happen
You ain’t sent them cowards to me, then that shit would not happen
When Jeezy first met me, man I swear to God I was trapping
You ain’t sent them cowards to me, then that shit would not happen

[Verse 2]
Rapping really ain't my passion, I’m really into trapping
I’m a real street nigga and I don’t know how it happened
I was going back to Cali, yeah I was getting that package
I had a sack when I met Big Cat I didn't need no one to pack it
I had a Chevy with the rallys, I'm lien' and I'm flyin'
Had a Regal with them 

[?] and that was '99
Maybe 1997, I'm two years behind, If you a Industry ass nigga
Then you not no friend of mine
Got them young niggas with me
I keep them hittas with me
I don't make a move unless I got some killers with me
Man the tryna come get me, I feel just like 50
I got 50 off in my clip I wish a nigga tempt me

[Hook]

[Hook]
Shout out to 40, water, molly water, 3 different bitches
When you may Sprinkle Me Man, I swear to God I was pimpin'
When Jeezy first met me, man I swear to God I was trappin'
If you ain’t sent them cowards to me, then that shit would not happen
That shit would not happen
That shit would not happen
You ain’t sent them cowards to me, then that shit would not happen
When Jeezy first met me, man I swear to God I was trapping
You ain’t sent them cowards to me, then that shit would not happen

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo
I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life, man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em
And let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate
I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup
For a punchline on duct tape
Wo-wo-wo-worried 'bout if my butt fake
Worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
Th-these girls are my sons
Jo-Jon & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight
I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5
Is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two
Big titties, big butt too
Fu-fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ri-ring finger where the rock is
The-these hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with
Ma-ma-mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens
Unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in
Like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me
Lance Stephenson

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, "Goddamn, this is the perfect time"
We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt, but I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh! Yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you, oh
That's 'cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck
Just give me the heads-up, so I can plan for it
Pinkprint

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Drake]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky (Ayy)
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I never fucked Nick' and that's fucked up
If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
'Cause she act like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story-teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga
I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the "b" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean "pop-pop-pop," then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
Sixteen in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with seventeen bullets
My story is how I went from "poor me"
To "please pour me a drink and celebrate with me"

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Lil Wayne]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Young Mula, baby!
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Intro: Beyond The Black Rainbow]

[Intro]
Aye, nigga, what that work like?
Aye, bitch, what that work like?
You know me I've been trappin' with it all night
Niggas wanna take it there, we can take it there, all night

[Verse 1]
Aye nigga, Raww with the drama
I'll bring it to your face, cook it like Benihana's
Then ride out on Yokohamas
And my fingernails dirty, I've been countin' straight 100's
Why these niggas wanna test me on the low though?
Got no mothafuckin' patience so I'm patient with the scope though
Put your potty mouth on the low
Sleepin' with the enemy, It's like hangin' on a rope
Jim Carrey, I ain't fuckin' with you liars
All black attire, if we match it fuel the fire
This time man we aimin' for the body
I'm puttin' X's on the wall, if you resurrect, you Makaveli
Sphinx, I'm a pharaoh, ain't a fairy
Potato on the barrel, watch your soul fly like a sparrow
All my niggas thorough about dinero
Nigga never was my homie, all these bitches know you're corny nigga

[Hook]
Aye, nigga, what that work like?

'Bout your money, you've been trappin' with it all night
Bitches wanna take it there, you gon' take it there all night

[Verse 2]
I make that money reappear
Hoppin' off the Lear, ain't no passengers in here
I got D'usse poppin', no beer
Why you in my ear? I can't hear the money clear
When I'm back in the city and it's clear
My name in the sky with the lights on the field
I'm a gold chain buyin' pioneer
Got that ricky in the trunk and I pop it if a nigga near
Papa's got a brand new bag, baby, Goyard
Cash, baby, Maybach rag, baby, yeah, baby
LK frames on the dash, smashin' the fast lane
With a baddy, mane, ass, got a fatty, mane
Tattoos, Vera Wang, G5, hydroplane
Last Kings, everything (everything?) everything
Cartier love rings, but this ain't no love thing
Married to them green things, Franklins and money trees

T-Raw
Last kings, bitch!
Lord, You've been in my shoes before
You already know what's up
You've been rejected by those closest to You
You've even drank from life's bitter cup

You know what it's like to be denied
And to have tears swimming in Your eyes
Sometimes, I want to hold up my hands
But I know You have a plan for me

('Cause I told you) I will be your everything
To me all your troubles bring
For me I want you to sing
You know that I know

I assure you I'll be there
All your burdens, I will bear
I'll let you know that I care
You know that I know

Lord, you felt what I feel
You know that the pain is real
Those who were there that said they loved You
Turned their backs when You needed them
But I must say
You have never let me down nor forsaken me
You would always pick me up
When the world would fall on me
I can trust in Your every word

Your voice, I hear You
I know I heard You tell me say

('Cause I told you) I will be your everything
To me all your troubles bring
For me I want you to sing
You know that I know

I assure you I'll be there
All your burden I will bear
I'll let you know that I care
You know that I know

I take a stand and hold my ground
For in me true love is found
I will always be around
You know that I know

Even when you heart is breaking
When it seems to much to take
And even when your soul is aching
You know that I know
Even when the world is cold
I'll be there your hand to hold
Trust me, love me and be bold
You know that I know

No one else can give you more
Blessings for you are in store
I will never ignore you
You know that I know
I will be your everything
To me all your troubles bring

Girl
I want you to sing for me
You know that I know

[Verse 1]
The storms of life will blow
They're sure to come and go;
They meet me at a time
When I'm calm and doing fine
But the captain of my soul
He's always on board
He rocks me in His arms
While I'm riding through the storm

[Chorus]
While riding through the storm
Jesus holds me in his arms
I am not afraid of the stormy winds and the waves
Though the tides become high
He holds me while I ride;
I find safety in the master's arms
While riding through the storm

[Verse 2]
I have no fear of the raging seas
Knowing Jesus is there for me;
He can speak to the winds and the waves
And make them behave
All power in His hands on sea or dry land;
I find safety in the Master's arms
While riding through the storm

[Chorus]
While riding through the storm
Jesus holds me in his arms
I am not afraid of the stormy winds and the waves
Though the tides become high
He holds me while I ride;
I find safety in the master's arms
While riding through the storm

[Vamp]
While I'm riding through the storm
Lord I hear of showers of blessings
Thou art scattering full and free
Showers the thirsty souls refreshing
Let some drops now fall on me

Pass me not oh gentle saviour
Sinful though my heart may be
I am longing for your favor

Whilst thou art blessing
Oh Lord
Come on and bless me

Even me Lord

While you are in
The blessing business today

I need a blessing, Lord

[Verse 1:]
Looking over the horizon
Night beaks into dawn
I get a little misty eyed
Knowing you've gone on

I suddenly came to realize just
How much your presence meant to me
I also realize that now you're finally free

[Chorus:]
I always love you
For the special times we shared
All the times you let me know
Just how much you cared for me

I'll always love you
You were a friend
That I could totally depend on
I love you
You're forever with me

[Verse 2:]
The Will of the Father had to be fullfilled
I still feel your spirit
Your voice still gives me chills

The annointing is still touching today
I wrote this song with a smile
With tears of joy just to say

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
We used to cry together
Sing together
And laugh together

You said it didn't matter
Because God would
Always take care

You taught me how to give again
When giving seemed to be too hard
The benefits of your love is my reward

[Repeat Chorus:]
I love you
You're forever with me
I love you
Yeah

You're forever with me
I love you, oh
You're forever with me
I love you're forever with me
(I could always depend on) you

I love you
You're forever with me
I love you
I'm gonna miss you

You're forever here with me
Everywhere that I go
I must tell everyone
Of the Savior I know

And the things He has done
He's the Truth and the Life
And there's no other way to the Father
But by him

Long ago when He knew
You'd be out on a limb
He gave His life for you
Can't you live yours for him

He's the Almighty Rock
And you won't have a firm foundation
Unless you're build on Him

You can't live without Him
You can't move without Him
You can't breathe without Him
You can't think about
Doing one thing without Him
You can't do without Him
'Cause there's no you without Him
Because He's the only way
The only way

There's no other name
Than the name of Jesus
There's no one
Than the one who frees us

There's no other way
No other way
What more can I say?
He's the only only way
The only way
I know there are times in your life
When the wheels just seem to turn
And uncertainties
About your tomorrow seem, to grow

I think you should remember
And you should always know
That out of everyone who loves you
I love you the most

For I am just a prayer away
Call my name with your heart
And I will hear
Every word you have to say

When you cry at night
I'll wipe your tears away
Just pray my love
I'll be there right away

You will never have to wonder about my love
Just put your faith and trust in my care
I will always be there
To hold you in my arms
When you're afraid
Don't you worry
I'll protect you

From the storm out of
Everyone who loves you
I your father love you the most

For I am just a prayer away
Call my name with your heart
And I will hear
Every word you have to say

When you cry at night
I'll wipe your tears away
Just pray my love
I'll be there right away
I love you
Do you really love me?
I cry for you
Have you wept with me?
I've cared for you
How much do you care for me?

So you could have me
I carried a load of shame
So could have my name
Have you done what I've asked of you?

I asked you to come unto me
Give all your cares and burdens to me
For I truly love you
Somehow I can't get through

I have only
The best for you
But my voice you ignore
Have you done
What I asked of you?
This is my message to you
I'm coming back for you
Yeah!
Yeah yeah!
Hhehheheh!
Yeah yeah uh heee yeah!

Gotta have love
Gotta have love
Gotta have love
Real love

When I was just a girl
My mama said to me
You can't fight hate with hate
You gotta love unselfishly

Love is not just a word
But a way of life you keep
You need to know
You're not here just to receive

Now that I'm older
Her advice I still take heed
For the power of his love
Lives in me
Ya gotta have love
Ya gotta have love on your mind
Ya gotta have love
Real love
Let your heart be your guide

It's gotta be real love
Feel so good in love
Gotta be real love
Or there's no sense in wasting your time

Didn't have to go far
To find myself
'Cause he knows the real me
More than anyone else

I found a higher place
Whose voice I must obey
When I was a child

I heard the Word that say
Now abide in these
Hope and charity
And the greatest of these three
Has set me free
Ya gotta have love
Ya gotta have love
On your mind

Ya gotta have love
Real love
Let your heart be your guide

It's gotta be real love
Feel so good in love
Gotta be real love
Or there's no sense in wasting your time

Gotta be unconditional love
Ya gotta be an example
Gotta have love

Love feels so good inside
It's gotta be a type of love
Or there's no sense in wasting your time

Yeah, sing it girl
Ya gotta have love
Y.A
Check it out check it out check it out
We got to have love
Because we're gettin' beat on the street
And others meet defeat with no heat
And nothin' to eat

And when you're walking down the street
You gotta step with pep
'Cause fools are mad
Enough to rob you
Just to get a rep

Is it me, G
Or is it society
But I can't see why
We kill for notoriety

That's whack
We lack love for the black
In fact
Let's end the attack
So we can get the love

Gotta have love
Gotta have love on your mind
The man on the street with nothing to eat
Wants love

The daughter who doesn't know her father
Wants love
Gotta have love

Mothers and fathers
Sisters and brothers
Want love
Real love

Let your heart be your guide
Everybody I know
Even they want love

They want a love that's real
One they can feel
One that's deep inside
That they can no longer hide

It's gotta be real love
Gotta be love
Or there's no sense in wastin' yo time

In time of fear and doubt
Look to Him, He'll bring you out

(I know He won't, I know, I know)
Even when all hope is gone

Look to Him, He'll bring you out
Faith the size of a mustard seed
To moving mountains and parting seas
To heal the sick, have victory

Jesus climbed the rugged hill
To give you joy abundantly
That prosperity, life eternally, yeah yeah

[Outro]
Only, only believe
All things are possible
Only, only believe
All things are possible
Believe in your heart
Never ever doubt His promises
If you only believe, yeah
You have longed for sweet peace
And for favour to increase
You have earnestly, so fervently
Oh oh, you really prayed

Oh, yes you have
But you cannot find rest
Nor be perfectly blessed
Until all on the alter
Until it's laid

Is your all on the alter of sacrifice?
Is it laid?
Your heart does the Spirit control?

Now, you can only
You can only be blessed
And have peace and sweet rest
After you have yielded unto the Lord
Your body and your soul
Is your all on the alter of sacrifice?
Of sacrifice laid?
Your heart does the Spirit control?

Now, you can only
Only, only be blessed
And have peace and sweet rest
After you have yielded Him
Yielded Him your body and your soul

That's all He wants
Everything, everything, everything
So would you walk with the Lord
In the beauty of His light?

Would you obey His Word
Everyday and every night?
We will never know just what
The Lord has to bestow upon his children
Until we give Him complete control

Give Him your
Your heart and your mind
Give Him your spirit, your soul

Give Him your thoughts
Give Him your ways, your desires
Just give Him your body and your soul

[Verse 1]
Shattered, but I'm not broken
Wounded, but time will heal
Heavy the load, the cross I bear
Lonely the road I trod, I dare
Shaken, but here I stand
Weary, still I press on
Long are the nights, the tears I cry
Dark are the days, no sun in the sky, yes

[Chorus]
Yet still I rise
Never to give up
Never to give in against all odds
Yet still I rise
High above the clouds
At times I feel low
Yet still I rise

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I'm troubled, but not in despair
Struggling, I make my way through
Trials, they come to make me strong
I must endure, I must hold on

[Chorus]
Yet still I rise
Never to give up
Never to give in against all odds
Yet still I rise
High above the clouds
At times I feel low
Yet still I rise

[Bridge]
Above all my problems
Above all my eyes can see
Knowing God is able to strengthen me
To strengthen me

[Outro]
Yet still I rise
Never to give up
Oh, never to give in against all odds
Yet still I rise
High above the clouds
At times I feel low
Yet still I
I need to know which way to go
Yet still I
At times I feel low
Yet still I
Oh, oh, oh, I, I rise
Yet still I rise
Oh yes, I do, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Every day is different
Like every love is different
I say it from the bottom of my heart
Well, well
You're my true fantasy
My daily covenant
I swear I would never bring you harm

[Pre-Chorus]
Just because you think we're lost don't make it true
I know ain't no rules to this game
I'm not gonna give up what we do
Every time you go searching for pain

[Chorus]
Take a long hard look
Grass is never greener on the other side
Every revolution turns a page
Take a long hard look
It ain't ever greener on the other side
Every resolution makes a change

[Bridge 1]
Take a long hard look at yourself
Look at yourself
Look at yourself
Baby look at us now
Look at us now
Look at us now
Darling

[Verse 2]
Every life is different
Like every love is different
You never could judge them by another
No no
You don't know what you want
So why you throw it away?
Even though we're made for each other

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge 2]
Take a long hard look at yourself
Look at yourself
Look at yourself
Baby look at us now
Look at us now
Look at us now

[Bridge 3]
Look at yourself
Look at yourself
Look at yourself
Baby look at us now
Look at us now
Look at us now
Darling
Tonight
I'm not about to waste no time
For only one night
You don't have to fantasize
I'm here right beside
I can be the girl you like
The one in your dream
I'll be the one that you desire

I'm not saying
You'll go crazy
Chasing everybody down
I'm just playing
Cause I know that
I'm the best loving around

I'm in heaven
Every time you
Lay your body next to me
You're in heaven
You'll keep coming back
Cause now you're in too deep

[Chorus] x2
Cause nothing brings the fire
And nothing gets you higher
Ain't nothing good as my loving, my loving, my loving
And I'll make you surrender
Nobody's gonna give ya
A love as good as my loving, my loving, my loving

Tonight you don't need an alibi
It's all in your mind
You just need to close your eyes
I'll let you try
To think about the other girls
But you can't deny
That what you've got is the best love
In the whole wide world

[Chorus] x2
Cause nothing brings the fire
And nothing gets you higher
Ain't nothing good as my loving, my loving, my loving
And I'll make you surrender
Nobody's gonna give ya
A love as good as my loving, my loving, my loving

I'm not saying
You'll go crazy
Chasing everybody down
I'm just playing
Cause I know that
I'm the best loving around
I'm in heaven
Every time you
Lay your body next to me
You're in heaven
You'll keep coming back
Cause now you're in too deep

[Chorus]
Cause nothing brings the fire
And nothing gets you higher
Ain't nothing good as my loving, my loving, my loving
And I'll make you surrender
Nobody's gonna give ya
A love as good as my loving, my loving, my loving

[Intro]
Yeah bitch
Wolf Gang, Sweatshirt, ho

[Verse 1]
'94 black music, beat a preacher's ass to it
Honor class crack movement, you faggots is ass chewin'
New black Rasputin get these hoes loose
As your back tooth with a Kimbo jab to it
Fuck y'all, they can't handle the fact
That I am not yet a man, I'm manhandlin' tracks
Tell these fags that the lip chapped champion's back
Wolf cack is up the ass of the tabbiest cat
My hands on my sock, I'm Pop, Crackle and Snap
Get it poppin' off, pop a couple Xan in some class
Smoke a little hash with my favorite janitor's ass
And beat my teacher 'til she gives my fuckin' mannequins back, bitch
Pigeon blood'll leave the stool wall shitted up
Shit talk, Myrtle fuck, get your little sister fucked
Shit, I'll hit stripper up to go and pick a different slut
To stick inside them fuckin' pots where we brew them bitches up
Rippin' writtens while my nigga Hodgy splittin' blunts
Eyes hazy with my middle finger up a stripper's cunt
Lights down, lit her up, sherm in my sippy cup
Ice pickin' cripples 'til I get my Tommy Pickle rub
Catch me poppin' pimples, tellin' bitches triple 6 is us
Stabbin' 'em with pencils in their temples 'til my dick erupts
It's really fuckin' simple, slut, Wolf Gang, get with us
Either that or grab a full fist of nuts and lick 'em up
Turn it up, fisticuffs, givin' bitches dick to suck
Let 'em drink the cum out a mothafuckin' paper cup
Whores wider than the horse that I'm sniffin' up
Leave now if you ain't tryna get them titties touched

[Verse 2]
We the best and I'm provin' it
Competition missin' like the braids of fuckin' Ludacris
Mop duplicates, get socked in the uterus
For steppin' in the section of them Odd Future hooligans
Psych, I'll take your uterine, hula hoop with it
Backslap her with a tube of lubricant
Tape it and take it to Ace's so we can do this shit
Carjack her parents' coupe and take a cruise in it
(?), Youtube the shit
Cut the bullshit what you forgot, (?)
Now you're pouting cause I'm playin' your pussy like it's a tuba, bitch
Too foul, loose bowels, get used to it
So point me to the nearest booth so I can poop in it

[Intro]
Mr. Worldwide, let's celebrate

[Chorus]
I just wanna celebrate
I just wanna celebrate
Tonight we makin' history
I just wanna celebrate

[Verse 1]
We've been around the world, same song
Work hard, play harder, all day long
All the continents get jealous over me
You can see me, 3D overseas
If you know me then you know where to find me
Off in the Bahamas with a bad one behind me
Now live it up, live it up, live it up
Baby pick it up, pick it up, pick it up

[Pre-Chorus]
And we gon' vroom vroom around the world
Vroom vroom, gon' get it girl
Vroom vroom, that's the way we like to play
And we gon' vroom vroom around the world
Vroom vroom, gon' get it girl
Vroom vroom, that's the way we like to play

[Chorus]
I just wanna celebrate
I just wanna celebrate
Tonight we makin' history

[Post-Chorus]
Turn it up
Turn it up

[Verse 2]
I've been patiently waitin' for you to shake it and shake it
Make it or take it, the point is we made it
Quarterback the game, call us Tom Brady
And it's not our fault that we have all the ladies
But it's hard to see these ladies when your middle name's Equator
All around the globe, matter fact, see you later
They're great, we're great and we're world dominators
And we're also some smooth operators

[Pre-Chorus]
And we gon' vroom vroom around the world
Vroom vroom, gon' get it girl
Vroom vroom, that's the way we like to play
And we gon' vroom vroom around the world
Vroom vroom, gon' get it girl
Vroom vroom, that's the way we like to play

[Chorus]
I just wanna celebrate
I just wanna celebrate
Tonight we makin' history
I just wanna celebrate

[Post-Chorus]
Turn it up
Turn it up

[Bridge]
Live it up, baby
It's a good time, that's what we're givin' you
Now live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up
Live it up, live it up.... what you wanna do?

[Chorus]
I just wanna celebrate
I just wanna celebrate
Tonight we makin' history
I just wanna celebrate

[Outro]
Turn it up, let's celebrate
Turn it up, let's celebrate

[Intro]
Oh, god!
Whoa

[Verse 1]
Lookin' at your last text
Damn, did you even really mean it?
Did you even look through it, did you even read it? (What)
I've been breakin' up with girls since I was fifteen
It's the only thing that hasn't got easier (Whoa)
A rubber is the only thing that ever came between us
Goddamn, now look at everything in between us
I mean I'm sayin' I got more liquor, more ladies
More drugs and no cases with jobs and no babies
I hope no phone’s taping, if so, you gon' hate me

[Chorus]
When you see me standing on the couches
Turnin' clubs into houses
Water to champagne fountains
Turn flat chests into mountains
And ooh, I love that ass
But I hate that fuckin' outfit
I'm takin' off her blouses
While she takin' off my trousers
That's just a couple more problems
To add to the couples counselin' (Oh)
Now open that shit wide
Let me see how big your mouth is
Let me see how big your mouth is

[Verse 2]
Goin' hard till I OD
I'm the newest version of the old me
All my exes are on me
Wishin' they could X and O me (Know it)
I'm on the edge and I'm hangin' all off (Whoa)
On the ledge and we danglin' off (Oh)
And if I let go, I won't fall off
If we set a wedding date, don't call off (No)
Bartender, I call the shots
We call for shots, y'all call the cops
Sometimes drinks speak louder than words do (Uh-huh)
Body language speaks louder than verbal

[Chorus]
And we standing on the couches
Turnin' clubs into houses (What)
Water to champagne fountains (God)
Turn flat chests into mountains (Oh, God)
And ooh, I love that ass
But I hate that fuckin' outfit (I do)
I'm takin' off her blouses
While she takin' off my trousers
That's just a couple more problems
To add to the couples counselin' (Oh, now)
Now open that shit wide
Let me see how big your mouth is (Oh)
Let me see how big your mouth is

[Outro]
This goes out to, uh
You know who this goes out to
Haha, yeah
(Hey!)

[Intro]
3pm
A deal is going down on the wrong side of the tracks
In Atlanta, Georgia
This nigga robbed me
Dope boys, I ain’t finna run to the police too fast

[Hook]
Man a nigga just broke in my spot
That’s like a nigga taking dope out my pot
He stole some money and some weed and a watch
I need the nigga dead by 5 O’clock
Fuck talking, I just want to hear shots
I ain’t asking if you did or did not
Imma run that nigga off of this block
I need the nigga dead by 5 O’clock

[Verse 1]
I’m a brick squad soldier, I thought I told ya
Mister ice cream man, I’m selling boulders
I lost a load, New Mexico, they fucking pulled her over
And she’ll never fuck me over nigga, all my bitches soldiers
Gresham road soldier, boulder crest soldier
And I told my bitch to quit me cause I never will propose to her
And as I get older my jewelry get colder
But why the task force had to put me in the folder
Rest in peace to Soldier Slim, that boy there was a soldier
Rest in peace to Pac and Big, cause them niggas was soldiers
They gave my partner 60 years, but he don’t think it’s over
I got money for his appeal cause we just want some closure

[Hook]
Man a nigga just broke in my spot
That’s like a nigga taking dope out my pot
He stole some money and some weed and a watch
I need the nigga dead by 5 O’clock
Fuck talking, I just want to hear shots
I ain’t asking if you did or did not
Imma run that nigga off of this block
I need the nigga dead by 5 O’clock

[Verse 2]
These young niggas play for keeps, today they'll kill your ass for sneaker money
A teacher makes like 30 thousand a year, I make that daily homie
I’m mister keep a big old pistol cause these niggas be hating on me
You got to get this pistol in your name, that be my lady baby
Bring me up that brand new FN, and get yourself a 3.80 baby
Trapping like it’s 1980, but I don’t really fuck with Reagan
I’m smoking kush in Central Station, drinking rum with some of my Haitians
Bitches say I’m two faced but these pussy niggas be scared to face it
I put a split on top of split then y’all niggas run in your shit
Wrapped in diamonds, so much money, can’t even wear a money clip
I tell them niggas go and your boyfriend will get pistol whipped
You try Guwop like he a hoe and that's how you got your uncle killed

[Hook]
Man a nigga just broke in my spot
That’s like a nigga taking dope out my pot
He stole some money and some weed and a watch
I need the nigga dead by 5 O’clock
Fuck talking, I just want to hear shots
I ain’t asking if you did or did not
Imma run that nigga off of this block
I need the nigga dead by 5 O’clock
My idea is to take my career to the next level. I am planning to take my music to a higher level and use the attention and influence to sell movies, books, clothing and be a living testimony to all people showing that you can start from humble beginnings and transcend to something greater

It feels great to see my plan take root and begin to blossom even though I’m physically incarcerated but spiritually and mentally I’m free as ever. I enjoy working out molding my body and I look forward to changing my diet for the better because I realize to get to the status I crave I must make a life-change which is permanent not a quick-fix

I can see myself now at the top of my game, me and my beautiful lady walking the red carpet at the best parties and getting flooded with accolades at the award shows and setting trends that will be copied around the world. This is not a dream though this is a plan that I will affect directly. I know that by me stayin sober, praying and fasting and stepping up to the plate to the father, and man I am destined to be I will impact my family and the entire universe for the better

Big choppa shoot 'em down
Soulja got the juice
Choppa whole, a hundred round
Soulja got the juice
Soulja got the juice
Soul Soulja got the juice

[Verse 1]
I’m allergic to ceilings, offended by tops
I don’t have no feelings, get that from my pops
Convertible Gucci, convertible Phantom
Got money on money, might drop the top on my mansion
Let me reintroduce me, I’m drop top Gucci
Had a hard top once, but now I’m drop top stupid
I got your girlfriend with me, she in an awkward position
Switching gears on the steering wheel and I’m revving the engine
She never seen nothing like it so she keeps asking me questions
She ask me where is my ceiling, I told her fuck it I left it
She started braining, I’m driving, I damn near went past the exit
I’m in a headless Ferrari, me and your wifey, she naked

[Hook]
Hit the bank, withdraw a million dollars, then make it rain at the house
Vacuum, then a month later I done found like 100 thou
Eating breakfast the next day, found diamonds all in my fruit loops
8 cars and they topless cause truthfully I don’t do roofs
I don’t do roofs, I don’t do roofs
I don’t do roofs, I don’t do roofs
8 cars and they topless cause truthfully I don’t do roofs
I don’t do roofs, I don’t do roofs

[Verse 2]
Got ahead in my car, got a headless car
Got my top pushed back but I’m up to par
She glazing at my Cartier's, looking at the star
My game is extraterrestrial, it’s next to Mars
Your niggas swag so stanky it’s an extra charge
Get in that ugly ass car, I’m dropping sexy bars
I know some killers long beards, and they praise Allah
I got some skinny waisted bitches, but they stuff cigars
So how we country and these cars ain’t from this country
Hit one button and fold my top just like it’s lunch
Sexy but can’t eat a spaghetti for nothing
Blood red Rari, drop my top, Spaghetti Junction

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
God damn a little boy got asthma
On my wall is a 100 inch plasma
They say you got money, nothing else matters
But to me nigga, family matters most
I got money and I smoke, smoke, smoke
I pray to god I don’t ever go broke
I ain’t never ever stopped selling dope
And I’ll never stop buying mink coats
My girl killing got a pink diamond choker
Yellow diamond necklace cost a Testarossa
She gotta walk kinda slow cause she’s a meal ticket
I only fuck with bad bitches, Gucci real picky
I got a city bitch, a country bitch, turn me up a lil bit
I gave you a lot of it, y’all ain’t seen the half of it
I got 30 squares, pussy nigga do the math of it
I got good aim, pussy nigga, Gucci accurate

[Chorus]
I'ma keep making money, I'ma keep making money
I'ma keep making money, I'ma keep making money
I'ma keep making money, I'ma keep making money
I'ma keep making money, I'ma keep making money
You keep making comments, I'ma keep making commas
You keep making comments but I keep making commas
Money don't make you real, but I really do got money
You keep chasing pussy, and I keep chasing money

[Verse 2]
Can’t stop me nigga, can’t block me nigga
Better chill, sit back and just watch me nigga
Getting so much top might top that nigga
Imma open up shop, come shop young nigga
Big Guwop, let’s shootout nigga
Send a fuck nigga up to 2Pac nigga
She sleep in my bed and she give me good head
But she still worrying bout what the bitch gon say
Still say you gonna get rich one day
Imma get money every goddamn day
Broke ass niggas can’t get no date
In the club, singing out, shawty swing my way
Money will talk like a high top fade
I’m a rich kid, baby who wanna come play?
At club LIV on a Sunday, screaming out free my nigga 4Tre
Sir Mixalot, my posse on broadway
Serve bricks a lot, I got so much yay
She a filthy bitch, she got a filthy twat
I can tell that the bitch sucks dicks a lot
I started off a nick bag, ran it up to a big bag
Left your friend with a shitbag, get glad or get mad

[Chorus]
I'ma keep making money, I'ma keep making money
I'ma keep making money, I'ma keep making money
I'ma keep making money, I'ma keep making money
I'ma keep making money, I'ma keep making money
You keep making comments, I'ma keep making commas
You keep making comments but I keep making commas
Money don't make you real, but I really do got money
You keep chasing pussy, and I keep chasing money
So this next clip is, uh, from a session that I had with Max Martin and Johan Shellback and what we like to do is we like to run, um, a recording on our phones of everything we're doing when we're putting a song together, just in case one of us blurts out a cool melody and then we forget about it, we want to go back and then-and replay the tape so that we can remind ourselves what exactly we were saying
Um, so I brought in this idea called "Blank Space," and this was me playing it for Max and Johan for the first time and they're shouting out these production ideas like, you know the "Oh!" at the beginning of the chorus, um, and that ended up in the song
So, this is the very beginning stages of the song on the album called "Blank Space"

"Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Diamonds, seasides, all those things

[?] this song that 

[?]
Like, oh my God, listen in
Listen in, I do too

[?]

[?] honest 

[?]
We can all sing this and cry

[All you're?] thinking, all this time

[?]
Oh my God, listen to me
Just forget what you've heard about me
Don't believe what you hear about me, hear about me
'Cause it's gonna be forever, or gonna go -
Yeah! Hey, hey!
Gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over -
This is like a, like an early 2000s Nelly track
Long list of ex-love -
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
*Click* I'll write your name
I've got a blank space, baby
*Click* I'll write your name"
That's awesome! I love it
Oh my god, everyone's gonna kill you
Yeah!

[Hook]
N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
Cause I can't get much wronger
Man I've been waiting all night now
That's how long I been on ya
(I need you right now!)

[Verse 1]
When the fast life takes its tole
That act right makes everything slow
Them black lights make everything glow
One of those nights where everything goes
Everybody goes through something
People be talking to you like you nothing
Then you be like bitch I'm me
Then your boss be like bitch then leave
You covered up your tats too long with them sleeves
You've gotta hit the club let the real you breathe
Would you believe, you'll never shine if you're not seen
So get all in they face like Noxzema
I know you mesmerized about that ass in them jeans
Please don't hit that raw, it's not clean
Please don't forget that all when it seems

[Hook]
N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
Cause I can't get much wronger
Man I've been waiting all night now
That's how long I been on ya
(I need you right now!)

[Verse 2]
Let's get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit
'Specially in my Pastel, on my Bape shit
Act like you can't tell who made this
New Gospel homie, take 6, and take this, haters

[Hook]
N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
Cause I can't get much wronger
Man I've been waiting all night now
That's how long I been on ya
(I need you right now!)

[Verse 3]
I don't know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
If God put me in ya plans or not
I'm tripping, this drink got me saying a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand yous, there's only one of me
I'm tripping, I'm caught up in the moment, right?
Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gon' do everything that Kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And we'll do anything when the time's right
Uh, baby you're makin' it
(Harder, better, faster, stronger)

[Hook]
N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
Cause I can't get much wronger
Man I've been waiting all night now
That's how long I been on ya
(I need you right now!)

[Outro]
You know how long I've been on ya
Since Prince was on Apollonia
Since O.J. had Isotoners
Don't act like I never told ya
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
People let me tell you about a place I know
To get in it don't take much dough
Where you can really do your thing, oh yeah
It's got a neon sign outside that says
Come in and take a look at your mind
You'd be surprised what you might find, yeah
Strobe lights flashin' way till after sundown
People gather there from all parts of town
Oh yeah, what do I call it
You know it's just across the track
People I'm talking about the psychedelic shack

Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at, oh yeah
You can have your fortune told
You can learn the meaning of soul
There ain't no such thing as time
Incense in the air
'In" signs painted everywhere
I guarantee you this place will blow your mind
Music so high, you can't get over it
So love you can't get under it
Right around the corner just across the track
People I'm talking about the psychedelic shack
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Millionaires, kings and queens go there to do their things
You might see anybody there, yeah
Bear skin rugs, tails and beads
Don't really matter what you wear
You can take off your shoes, sit on the floor
Join in and be what you wanna be
Don't you know that it's right
Around the corner just across the track
People I'm talking about the psychedelic shack

Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
They got a cat there shouting the blues
Talking about payin some dues
People walking around reciting poetry
Screamin guitars and a thousand colored lights
People I'm telling you this place is really out of sight
You can have your fortune told
You can learn the meaning of soul
I guarantee this place will blow your mind
Don't you know it's right around the corner
Just across the track
People I'm talking about the psychedelic shack

[Verse 1]
Dollar signs
Said, "Fuck this shit," you know what's on my mind
Stay on your hustle, you be on your grind
Rip out your heart and left it on the line
You running out of time
You lose your mind, you lose your fuckin' mind
You lose your mind, you lose your fuckin' mind
You close your eyes, you're seeing dollar signs, dollar signs

[Chorus]
People searching for answers
While the world's spinning faster
They say love is the answer
All you see is dollar signs
Dollar signs
Dollar signs

[Verse 2]
Dollar signs
I told you once, ain't gotta tell you twice
If life's a game, I'm throwing loaded dice
These other girls ain't really what you like, what you like
Feeling like running away
Stressing 'bout nothing all day
Money and hoes, come and they go
Let them go, fuck 'em away
Everything ain't what it seems
If it's all just a dream
I believe it, I believe it

[Chorus]
People searching for answers
While the world's spinning faster
They say love is the answer
All you see is dollar signs
Dollar signs

[Bridge]
Love is something vicious
Still, it isn't right
Seeing all them secrets in your eyes
Meet me in the middle
Underneath the lights
You know I ain't got no chill tonight
No chill, no chill, no
Got no chill tonight
No chill, no chill, no
Got no chill tonight
No chill, no chill, no
Got no chill tonight
No chill, no chill, no
Got no chill tonight

[Chorus]
People searching for answers
While the world's spinning faster
They say love is the answer
All you see is dollar signs
Dollar signs
Dollar signs

[Verse 1]
Always running from what feels right
Too fast and I didn't know
Then I'm in a toast to daylight
You're here, no way to let go
Don't look back when you're holding me
'Cause I know what this love was meant to be

[Chorus]
One day, we're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here together
And it feels so good in my arms
We're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here forever
'Cause we'll wake up together

[Verse 2]
I got something and it feels right
What I needed to be, can't control what you feel for me
I was watching you the whole night
I can never explain how the magic was made
Don't look back when you're holding me
'Cause I know what this love was meant to be

[Chorus]
One day, we're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here together
And it feels so good in my arms
We're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here forever
'Cause we'll wake up together

[Breakdown]
One day you won't wanna go home
And it feels so good in my arms
You won't wanna go home
'Cause we wake up together

[Verse 1]
I need a little space in my mind
I need that little hope I can find
I need a little, I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
I need to feel my soul come alive
I need to feel the strength to get by
I need a little, I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
Too much to ask for?
Too much to ask for?
Too much to ask for?

[Verse 2]
I need a little space in my mind
I need that little hope I can find
I need a little, I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
I need to feel my soul come alive
I need to feel the strength to get by
I need a little, I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
Too much to ask for?
Too much to ask for?
Too much to ask for?

[Verse 3]
I need a little faith
I need a little faith
I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
I need a little faith
I need a little faith
I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
Too much to ask for?
Too much to ask for?
Too much to ask for?

[Verse 1]
We must bear our souls, souls, souls
Let the fate we fight take hold, hold, hold
Baby, when you come real close, close, close
It's alright 'cause I am whole

[Chorus]
'Cause I have been running too long
I wanna love now
I wanna love now
I wanna feel
Don't weigh up this heart that you hold
I wanna love now
I wanna love now
I wanna feel

[Verse 2]
We can tiptoe 'round our dreams, dreams, dreams
Just to crash through reality, yeah
I won't spend eternity
Hoping this time I'll be free, free

[Chorus]
'Cause I have been running too long
I wanna love now
I wanna love now
I wanna feel
Don't weigh up this heart that you hold
I wanna love now
I wanna love now
I wanna feel

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
'Cause I have been running too long
I wanna love now
I wanna love now
I wanna feel
Don't weigh up this heart that you hold
I wanna love now
I wanna love now
I wanna feel

[Intro]
Nah-nah-nah, nah-nah

[Verse 1]
Went from chicken shit ho to magnificent pro
Shoppin' bags at the grove, MCM on the coat
Had to clean up her nose, had to dream up some goals
Swimming in Fendi business that's probably owned
I was walking down 6th, she pulled up in a 6
She said "Hop in this whip," I said "Bitch, you the feds"
She said "Baby, don't trip," then she rolled me a spliff
Showed me pics of her kids, then she slid me some bread like

[Bridge]
It's yours, babe, 'cause I got big money
So if you need something, don't be ashamed
It's yours, babe, 'cause you got big lovin'
So go and spend somethin', I said, okay
I said, okay (All I need... good love)
I said, okay (Hey)
I said, okay (All a nigga need, yeah... good love)
I said, okay (Uh-huh)

[Hook]
And now
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, I'm swimming in milk n' honey
Swi-swimming in milk n' honey, swimming in milk n' honey
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, swi-swimming in milk n' honey
Dick in this bitch's stomach (Spending this bitch's money)
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, I'm swimming in milk n' honey
Swi-swimming in milk n' honey, swimming in milk n' honey
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, swi-swimming in milk n' honey
Dick in this bitch's stomach (Spending this bitch's money)

[Verse 2]
It's too good to be true, I got nothin' to do
I got keys to the coupe, I just spent all this loot
She said "Get what you want," she said "Live how you do
But If I catch you with other bitches, your throat - I'ma slit"
I said "It's yours, babe, I put your name on this dick"
But I was lyin', of course, I'm slammin' chick after chick
Soon as she gave me the Porsche, I bang her right on the strip
I copped some white in the 5th and pulled up right on a bitch like

[Bridge]
It's yours, babe, 'cause I got big money
So if you need something, don't be ashamed
It's yours, babe, 'cause you got big lovin'
So go and spend somethin', I said, okay
I said, okay (All I need... good love)
I said, okay (Hey)
I said, okay (All a nigga need, yeah... good love)
I said, okay (Uh-huh)

[Hook]
And now
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, I'm swimming in milk n' honey
Swi-swimming in milk n' honey, swimming in milk n' honey
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, swi-swimming in milk n' honey
Dick in this bitch's stomach (Spending this bitch's money)
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, I'm swimming in milk n' honey
Swi-swimming in milk n' honey, swimming in milk n' honey
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, swi-swimming in milk n' honey
Dick in this bitch's stomach (Spending this bitch's money)

[Verse 3]
I got gold, I got ice, I got Polo and Nikes
I got lean, I got Sprite, 'bout to spend a couple racks in one night
And mothafuckas wanna tell me take it light
And mothafuckas wanna tell me take it easy
I don't need no one's advice, niggas all wanna be me
I was riding down 6th and got stopped by the pigs
They said "Hop out the whip," I said, "Fuck did I do?"
They said "Pop up the trunk," I'm like pop up this dick
They said "Don't make us shoot," they said "Don't make a move"
I was high as a kite, I had Xannies and white
I looked up at the light, like what the fuck is my life
They said my plates ain't legit, so they opened my shit
And when they opened my shit, it was snow in a fridge
I felt dumb as a brick, I had no idea
She had stolen the whip and this bitch had warrants and shit and
This bitch pulled multiple licks and this bitch had bodies on burners
And when I called from my cell, the only message I heard was

[Outro]
(It's yours, babe)
I mean, you gotta do what you gotta do
Don't scr... don't say a fucking word
(It's yours, babe)
No, you don't say shit
Now I'm gone, I'm on a plane, babe
(It's yours, babe)
But no, you wanted to spend the money
You wanted to live, you know, wanted to live large
You got new sneakers and all that
So now, you deal with them bricks
(It's yours, babe)
Na-na-na-nah, nah, I can't do nothing for you
I told you, I'm on a G5, I'm gone
I'm too gone, I gotta go now
You say my fucking name, you a dead man
(I said, okay)
I said, okay

[Verse 1]
Oh, I remember when this road was my own
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
And more, I lost the feeling but I try to hold on
I thought the end of a love is what made you strong
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore

[Verse 2]
When there's no getting through
I won't hold back
I will throw down everything in life, I know now
I've been lyin' on the floor
Sleeping on the ground
I will give up everything in life, I know how

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to perceive the signs
If I could go back with hands up
I'd look up to the sky

[Chorus]
And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give in to you, give in to you

[Verse 3]
Oh, when the moon was shining bright before mornin'
I made a deal with the stars to keep holdin'
Shinin' bright to come and bring me back home
The lights in my eyes, they disappeared
Visions of my mind are enough to keep me from fear
I won't let it hold me down, the other way around
I don't want the words to, I can't make a sound

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to perceive the signs
If I could go back with hands up
I'd look up to the sky

[Chorus]
And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give in to you, give in to you

[Bridge]
Can't hold back, reachin' out
(Hot, hot) I was livin' in the heat in the moment
Between us, I told you that
(Hot, hot) I was livin' in the heat in the moment
I'd give in
(Hot, hot) I was livin' in the heat in the moment
I'd give in
(Hot, hot) I was livin' in the heat in the moment
I'd give in
(Hot, hot) I was livin' in the heat in the moment
I'd give in to you, give in to you

[Chorus]
And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give in to you, give in to you
And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give in to you, give in to you

[Intro: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
And now, our national anthem!
It's going down, West Coast
A toast to the Coast, West Coast!
I got my nigga Mack 10 up in the house from the Westside Connection
My nigga Deadly Threat from the L.A. Zoo
L-B-C Crew, D.P.G, West Coast finest
Here's a toast to the coast!

[Verse One: Mack 10]
What have we? - a house full of Cavi, no stress
Well known riders from different sides of the West
Got the hi-zoes licking up, so hard we're sticking up
How could the East Coast win; when the West Coast is clicking up?
So please, no set tripping about Cs and Bs
It's the Westside connected with the D.P.G.s
For the cheese we're jab with the gift of the gab always capping
Mack 10 and Snoop rapping, now how does that happen?
It's all good, fool, so peep game if you could
Snoop be from Long Beach, and I be from Inglewood
So now you despise, cause it came to your surprise
Two well known enemies now becoming allies
In Californ-I-A; we parley the G way
Some wear red and black, and some sport (Blue and Grey!)
But gangsters don't dance, we hang-boogie and bang
So it's the Westside connected with the Dogg Pound Gang

[Chorus: Snoop Doggy Dogg X2]
We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)
We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)
Party people, party people; do you wanna get funky?
Get down.. get down.. you know..

[Verse Two: Bad Azz]
Up jump the boogie, so I've jumped up with it
We smoke weed by the ounce, no hit it
It's a party, Bombay and Bacardi, O.E. and Hennessy
We're all heated just in case; any of my enemies slipped in
Tripped in, you don't wanna own a casket this soon
Get at the bitches, nigga, bump to the boom
The ladies love me cause I love myself
I'm like an age, by no wine in time you'll find;
I'm at the top of the shelf
So when you ready and you're cracking a sip
Strip, trip, slide around your house in your slippers
Bump the rap tunes that's as cold as the Whispers
Fantastic, brand new in this classic
We done mellowed out but you still get your ass kicked
It's Mr. Bad Azz, I rock microphones right
West Coast, East Side, for life!

[Verse Three: Techniec]
It ain't no need for the fronting black, between me and you
Reality bites, so I'ma keep it real with my crew
I'm dangerous like Michael Dew
My life cycle completes the last stages
I'm more, I'm through, definitely gauges is outrageous
Cause I was born to rock the party
Oh! now you're Mister Smarty because we got the show started!
I'm cold hearted, and won't stop what I'm revealing
Leave it up to the West to have them dancing on the ceiling
And I'm feeling, that Vibe that represents the East
I attack like a pack, to make them burn like grease
So let the nonsense cease, and hold my piece in case
Reel-to-reel come to deal, I have to give them a taste
I serve face to face, rhymes define by Tech
Versatile style done switched up to wreck your whole set

[Interlude: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
That's real, you know
It's getting kind funky here man, uhh..

[Verse Four: Kurupt]
Mack 10 is the lick, Dogg Pound is the clique
I can't get enough of this gangster shit
My name ain't +Jeru+ and I ain't out to +Dama-ja+
But when on the mic, emcees, to me, they're all amateurs
See the opponents; disassemble the components
Disassemble the opponents, then disappear in a moment
In a blink's time, I take time in the doorway to crime
With a criminal mind, the raw kind
Microphones used so abusively
You can't fuck with the K-U-R-U-P-T
And in the mixture, painted clearer than a picture of a psycho
I'm suicidal, split shit to cause a twister
And get you twisted, you're fucking with the unlisted
To be specific; niggas ain't being realistic
I ain't impressed, you're about to get your chest test
In the west; where it's about your money and your set

[Verse Five: Deadly Threat]
You East Coast niggas flow like the home grown grow
Zoo got the flavor, every color for the rainbow
Dream, on out far, pass the stars
Your styles ain't doper than ours
Hard to the core, hit it one time, hit it some more
Y'all spit but that West Coast shit is out doors
Wild like Ninety Days in the cage
Cold like the Everglades, and never fades
Me, C to the Z to the T
Beef? Bet' not let me catch you in the streets
Hoo-Bang, cracked in the fast lane
The melody by Deadly, the Dopeman

[Outro: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Yeah yeah yeah, there you have it
It's like magic, it's so tragic

Keep it real though!

[Intro: Big Pimpin]
Just another day in the motherfucking neighborhood
A pimp's waking up and he's feeling good
Versace to the flow
He didn't even mess with the Taylor made shit today y'all
Smelling good with his reptiles on for sure

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I'm waking up in the morning, man I'm mourning; what's wrong?
My Nigga Corleone gone in my Zoning, but I'm boning, out to school
Cause I can't be late, cause they'll lock the gate
And it's damn near eight, that's when the bell ring
I'm a slide on in, and come right on in
And once I bail through the hallways, giving it up
Funky fresh stars and khakis, cool living it up
What up? - the same shit trying get paid and stay strong
Lunchtime, I make my way to get my grub on
Ten minutes to one, feeling good like I should for sure
Fourth period; walk through the door
I'm wreaking and smelling like endo
But still the day moves on to 2:44; one minute left to class
By Warren G, the Twins and Daz
Nate Dogg finna scoop us up in a blue drop top Brouham
I hear some bitches from Wilson wanna tag.. along
And get up, for the get-down
Word got around about the niggas from the Piddound
We keep the whores on point, to join on lit
And keep heat discreet, until the shit jump off
Well we're all from the side, so we won't ask why
So you best get high!

[Chorus: X2]
Too high, so fly, like Snoop is poly high

[Verse 2: Wayniac]
See I... took advantage cause I live right next door
To the funkhouse, dunkhouse with the whole show
Niggas know how we go; from first 'til four we don't show
Lunch and then the last whore
It's getting dealt with some melt shit I guess
We smoke the Stress, cause my quest wasn't chronic yet
Little niggas growing up with my dogs
Cause we pack the hogs, exercise for my balls

[Verse 3: Trip Locc]
Stacked bigger than I thought it would be
Me and the family, working on TV, get paid and fuck their enemy
Moving on up, like the Jeffersons but quicker
All we think about is finding ways to get richer
Hit you like some dodo, got you're begging for more
It's a trip, I'm serving on the solo
Low blow, I had you feeling me
I got some C-O-N-V-O for your community

[Verse 4: Daz Dillinger]
I'm still in a fast lane state of mind
Time is impossible, for me to try to find
I'm out of school on the line
Hustling here and there, never show no fear
Hosted it up on a watch, I posted it up with a Glock
PCH in atlantic, is what you see just don't panic
It's me, Snoop rocks and when my homies get static
Got a pistol that blasts like a cannon
Look out for when we form at the wall, nigga where you standing?
Raise up, realize, street lights magnify
Life is giving; don't let it pass you by
I'm here and there with the bud, conversating with the drink
Shocked in my own zone, got time to think
Cause what would I be, if I wasn't who I am
Maybe dead or in jail, maybe time'll never tell
Approach me wrong and you will get chin checked
To disrespect my clique, and you will get dealt with
Uhh.. plain and simple, nevertheless with the best shit available
Test me now, let me see how brave you are
I'm scott free, so it's on like it used to be
D-O-G-G P-O-U-N-D G-C, for life, two times 'til I die
Oh why, Oh why, life is a challenge when you die?
What's the peak for me, is the cash and the strap
Since the 2-1-3 days been like that

[Chorus: X2]

[Outro: Big Pimpin]
Feeling very playish, ha.. I mean very plash
And the bitches saying: why shouldn't he?
Yeah he should; doing what he does and he does it good
He goes to work, yeah, he does it good
On pavement or dirt, checking the skirt
The story of a Pimp's Life, yeah baby
You gotta have the stomach for this shit, Hoo weeee
To fuck with this, the story of a Pimp's Life
Ohh yes baby, honey suckle to a berry
Got to check; the traps, got to check the dollars
Got a doctorate from the street called: Peace Mack of Diamond Net
A scholar with my niggas from the underground 

[Echoes]

[Verse 1]
Fall back and touch the night
And reach for the blinding light
'Cause everybody says that we're too young to see
We know that we're brave enough to be

[Chorus]
In a state of ecstasy
In the place we're meant to be
In a state of ecstasy
There is only you and me

[Verse 2]
Break through from the other side
And lead me to paradise
'Cause nothing but love can take us away from here
Every time I close my eyes, we disappear

[Chorus]
In a state of ecstasy
In the place we're meant to be
In a state of ecstasy
There is only you and me

[Bridge]
Ooh ooh, eh eh
Ooh ooh, eh eh
Ooh ooh, eh eh
Ooh ooh, eh eh

[Chorus]
In a state of ecstasy
In the place we're meant to be
In a state of ecstasy
There is only you and me
In a state of ecstasy
In the place we're meant to be
In a state of ecstasy
There is only you and me
My idea is to take my career to the next level. I am planning to take my music to a higher level and use the attention and influence to sell movies, books, clothing and be a living testimony to all people showing that you can start from humble beginnings and transcend to something greater

It feels great to see my plan take root and begin to blossom even though I’m physically incarcerated but spiritually and mentally I’m free as ever. I enjoy working out molding my body and I look forward to changing my diet for the better because I realize to get to the status I crave I must make a life-change which is permanent not a quick-fix

I can see myself now at the top of my game, me and my beautiful lady walking the red carpet at the best parties and getting flooded with accolades at the award shows and setting trends that will be copied around the world. This is not a dream though this is a plan that I will affect directly. I know that by me stayin sober, praying and fasting and stepping up to the plate to be the father, and man I am destined to be I will impact my family and the entire universe for the better

[Intro: Styles P & Jadakiss]
Hahaha (Hahaha)
C5, D-Block, L-O-X
You know?
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Jadakiss & Styles P]
Say the judge or the jury can't spoil this
Nah, two thirds of the world's most loyalest
I'ma shoot em, I'ma pay the bail, I'm sure of this
I'ma kill em, I'ma get the witness, teach 'em more of this
We never sing, not even on a song, where the chorus is
Dig the hole, get the wood box, bring the florist in
Tell the pastor, tell the family, we was just warnin' them
38's, 45's, all type of Tauruses
About to hit the bong, pour the Holy water in
Celebrating', for participatin', in the slaughterin'
Eatin' steaks at the same spot, they killed Paulie in
Frank White's three in the quarter, tapin' your daughter in
Columbia with the connect, puttin' the order in
Nigga act, we gon' clap, like we the audience
Make sure you wipe down the strap, get rid of all the prints
Do your homework on, whoever you go to war against

[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]
I had 20s on my Benz, lend it to all my friends
And everything was all gravy, everything was all gravy
And if I need somethin' call Baby, I need something call Baby
And the streets was callin' me, but a nigga had call waitin'
And yeah we all went through our phases, we all went through our savings
Some niggas stayed on point, some niggas was point shavin'
And sometimes we had to be vegetables
That mean we had to stay patient, 'cause they say you are what you eat
I took the star out of starvation, bitch
I come from a Third World, started rappin' in the fourth grade
Started trappin' in the sixth grade, went platinum in the tenth grade
Dropped out, a nigga gettin' paid, this when Birdman had a fade
This when Hummers didn't come stretch, but Birdman had 'em made
This when pretty bitches set you up, and niggas didn't give two fucks
You had two guns and two phones, you could waste time and get a new cup
But this when niggas had pimp cups, and new rappers got hemmed up
And all them niggas that's bitin' got they fins cut

[Bridge: Lil' Wayne]
I know real niggas gon' fuck with this
Like, "That's that shit I be talkin' 'bout"
I know real niggas gon' fuck with this
Like, "That's that shit I be talkin' 'bout"

[Hook: Lil' Wayne]
And we gon' be around 'til yo motherfuckin' body rot
And if the Feds bring us in, we get the same time Gotti got
And if the Feds bring us in, we get the same time Gotti got
And if the Feds bring us in, we get the same time Gotti got

[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
Uh
But this when niggas had pimp cups, and dirty money got rinsed up
And the early birds in the wormhole would get so fat that they'd get stuck
We'd clean our fingerprints up, we'd clean the shit we didn't touch
This when niggas called Diddy Puff, lettin' Biggie bump
While I'm sittin' up in that big body, I can show you a dead body
Lotta niggas got pinched, and the snitches ended up dead lobsters
Wrap the birds in red tape, call them bitches Red Robins
Pops had kilos, I needed one ki I would've made copies
Free my niggas down and Rest In Peace to all my dead partners
I smoke 'bout a pound in like a week, and fuck the Weight Watchers
Got my self a brand new triple beam, just to weigh options
I stumbled upon a gold mine, I thank God that it ain't copper
Some niggas were late bloomers, but, boy, look how they've blossomed
Don't know niggas that wear wires but I know niggas that go haywire
I know hoes that play possum, and will bring us to y'all mailboxes
And dead man can't talk and the Feds don't have séances
Look, you put a knot on the end of a condom full of drugs and put it in her pussy
And get through customs, 'cause last time we just took em
I rather be blind before I be the nigga that stand around just lookin'
And you can beat around the bush and find a nigga layin' behind them bushes

[Bridge: Lil' Wayne]
I know real niggas gon' fuck with this
Like, "That's that shit I be talkin' 'bout"
I know real niggas gon' fuck with this
Like, "That's that shit I be talkin' 'bout"

[Hook: Lil' Wayne]
And we gon' be around 'til yo motherfuckin' body rot
And if the Feds bring us in, we get the same time Gotti got
And if the Feds bring us in, we get the same time Gotti got
And if the Feds bring us in, we get the same time Gotti got

[Chorus]
I get the feelin' that ya might be
Did I turn you on? You can tell me if I'm wrong
But I'm feelin' that ya might be
And we ain't even smoke but you swear I got that dope
And I'm thinkin' you'd like to be
Every word I speak got you floatin' off your seat
And I'm knowin' that you like me
Oh, you high, baby, high, baby

[Verse 1]
Okay, the blunt is rolled up
Nobody lit it
Said, even if we don't puff
Won't make a difference
My body's leaning to the right, baby
You tell me go on and spend the night, baby?
No, I don't even know ya
I know enough to get you high, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I got about a half an ounce of that tree
Got about a half a cup of that lean
I said go on and kick your feet up
I'ma go ahead and twist the weed up
She said cool to say what I think
I said, go and do what you feel
She said, bend me over that sink
I said, damn, your wish is my will

[Chorus]
I get the feelin' that ya might be
Did I turn you on? You can tell me if I'm wrong
But I'm feelin' that ya might be
And we ain't even smoke but you swear I got that dope
And I'm thinkin' you'd like to be
Every word I speak got you floatin' off your seat
And I'm knowin' that you like me
Oh, you high, baby, high, baby

[Verse 2]
Okay, I'm feelin' so stuck
Laid up on the couch, got fingers in your mouth
Girl, bring it closer
Before my high comes down, my high comes down
Girl, I can barely keep my eyes open
You say, you tryna get your spine blown in
No, I don't even know ya
I know enough to get you high floatin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I got about a half an ounce of that tree
Got about a half a cup of that lean
I said, go on and kick your feet up
I'ma go ahead and twist the weed up
She said, cool to say what I think
I said, go and do what you feel
She said, bend me over that sink
I said, damn your wish is my will

[Breakdown]
Feelin' that ya might be
Oh, tell me, are you high, baby
I get the feelin' that ya
Tell me, are you high as me?
Oh, tell me, are you high?
Tell me, you high? Are you high, are you high as me?
Oh, tell me, are you high?
Tell me you are, tell me, are you high as me?

[Chorus]
I get the feelin' that ya might be
Did I turn you on? You can tell me if I'm wrong
But I'm feelin' that ya might be
And we ain't even smoke but you swear I got that dope
And I'm thinkin' you'd like to be
Every word I speak got you floatin' off your seat
And I'm knowin' that you like me
Oh, you high, baby, high, baby

[DMX]
Yeah, uh

[DMX] (verse 1)
Girls are my profession and obsession, I place nothing above them
To me they're not possessions I really truly love them
Short ones, tall ones, big ones, small ones
Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall ones
Yo, I love them all, especially the cuties
The ones with the smooth complexion and shapely booties
The kinds that make you say "Oh Boy" ya
But if you're ugly ones, I ain't got nothing for ya
I'm not conceited, I'm convinced that I've been naturally blessed
To be desired when naked and irresistible when dressed
And with that, brings that, breaks down resistance
Of me to a cutie, I bag them for instance
I seen a cutie with a bootie, wiggling just like Jell-O
Me being a player, I approached and said "Hello"
But she didn't hear me, so I tapped her softly
She turned around screaming on me "Back up off me"
I said damn, there is no need for hostility
I'm a mellow type of fellow but still with tranquility
She said "I recognize that all of y'all are the same
After only one thing, and I'm not simp for the game"
I said "Come on now sweetheart, do I look like a Player"
She said "Of course not...sike"
But for the sake of argument let me know the deal
I want to ask you
(DMX singing)
Are you for real?
Are you really for real
Is this love I feel
The way you make me feel

[DMX] (Verse 2)
I'm as real as it gets
My name is not James Brown, but I could leave in "Cold Sweat"
And I bet, no ifs, ands or maybes
When I finish I'm a have you saying "Do Me Baby"
She said "Alright, I'ma give you a try"
Because she said "I think you're kind of fly and my type of guy"
She said her name is Crystal and kept a pistol on her
And she said if I ever cheated, believe I'd be a goner
So I played the perfect gentleman every time I was with her
And when I wasn't with her I was gone to get her
And when I wasn't going to get her, she was come to get me
And when she wasn't coming to get me, she was with me
So for awhile, everything was smooth
I waited and contemplated my next move
My instincts told me that the time was right
For us to get together for a magical night
So I called her, I said "Hello" she said "Hey, hold on
I already know what you have to say"
(DMX singing as if he was Crystal)
Baby, I know you're wondering
Why I won't go over to your place
Because I'm not too sure about how you feel
So I'd rather go at my own pace
For I don't know how I feel
I'm so afraid of a one night deal
I

[DMX] (Verse 3)
Hold on sweetheart, just chill, relax
You're telling me the answer and I didn't even ask
Don't you think, that we should be alone?
This isn't the type of thing to talk about over the phone
(DMX singing)
Why don't you come over and go with me
Come on over to my place

[DMX rapping]
Where we can talk about it face to face

[DMX singing]
Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place

[DMX rapping]
So we can discuss the terms of picking up the pace
She said "I thought about it, and I think that you're right
But my parents are home so it won't be tonight
But why don't you come over tomorrow at 8
My parents leave at 7:30 and won't be back until late"
I said bet, let me go and get set
Tomorrow will be a day that you will not forget
So the next day around 7:54
I fixed up like 6 times and then headed for the door
And when I stepped outside, I was asked where I was going
By detectives with .9 millimeters that was showing
I said "To me girls house", they said "No you aren't"
I said "Why not" they said "Because you a have warrant"
I said "That's impossible, how could that be?"
That said "It's right here, robbery, first degree"
Well, anyway, to make a long story short
I ended up in Valhalla going to court
So I called Crystal that night around 8
I said it's just a mix up and blamed it on fate
She told me that she loved me, I promise to wait
She said I'll see you at 4, at your next court date
Despite being locked up, things weren't bad
I still had my girl and for that I was glad
She always came to visit, didn't mind the hike
And every night I wrote her letters telling her things like
(DMX singing)
I can't fool myself I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shining star my guiding light my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of ya
I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say "I love you"
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in
Oh my love, a thousand kisses from you
Is never too much, I just don't wanna stop

[DMX] (Verse 4)
Days turn into weeks, weeks into months
Today's the 25th and I've only got mail..once
What has happened to my love life?
Oh do I feel like I've been stabbed into the back with a knife
I tried to believe, I said "She loves me, she does"
But deep down, I knew what the scoop really was
See Jody has my girl, and now she was gone
Just thinking about it had me singing every love song
I'm saying to myself, how could she do me wrong?
I said it's not her fault, I was away for too long
I thought I had a girlfriend, but now I know better
She told me that she wrote me but I never got the letter
And every time I tried to call her, nobody was home
And since I had to call collect she put a block on the phone
She told me she would visit, but damn I haven't seen her
You wanna know why, because Jody is in between her
Legs and getting busy, he even ate the coochie
Yo, I bought her everything from Fendi to Gucci
But Jody had something better, he didn't even have to sweat her
And if he doesn't have her by now, he's gonna get her

(DMX singing)
Caught in the middle I don't know what to do
What can you do when your girl is untrue
There's another man (another man)
In my life (in my life)
Another man is beating my time (Another man is beating my time)
Another man is lovin mine (Another man is lovin mine)

[DMX] (Verse 5)
I was upset, but there was other things on my mind
I was 

[?], I was facing a lot of time
And on the day of trial, I was never for awhile
But when they said "Not guilty"
I stepped with a smile
Back to freedom, freedom on the streets again
But I had to go and see what was up with my friend
So I called her, just to make sure she was home
I said "Hello" and a man's voice answered the phone
I was confused, at first I didn't know what to do
He said "It's Jody, and what is it to you?"
So I hung up the receiver, picked up my gun and
Straight for Crystal's crib, I started running
Murder, murder, my finger's on the trigger
Murder, murder, I'm a murder this nigga
But then I thought, why should I do him
He wouldn't have the pussy if she didn't give it to him
I thought about killing him, I thought about it twice and
Nah, because it wouldn't be nice
But for the sake of curiosity I had to go and see Crystal
And I asked, why did it have to be me
I knocked on the door and just like before and
I heard another man's voice play me and couldn't take it anymore
The door opened up and Jody walked my vexed
He looked me up and down and said "I guess you're X"
Now here comes Crystal, yelling and fussing
Hollering and screaming, shouting and cussing
She looked at me inside and got quite in the hall
She said "When did you get home, and why didn't you call"
I turned around to leave, she said "Please don't go"
I said "You used to be my girl but you ain't nothing but a Ho
I understand because I'm a man, but there's no way I could stay"

(DMX singing)
Spread my wings
And fly away...(away)
Spread my wings
And fly away...(away)

Mary J - what's on your brain
Don't you know you can't diss where you came - from
The motherfucking slum
You remind me of when you was a bum
Crazy dumb - getting hit in the hallway
Building 5 - I heard you take it all ways
In the ass and especially the mouth
You get on the radio and now you're from down south, the Bronx, or Brooklyn
Anywhere but from the Schlobohm
Sure you know the place that you left your mom...
I'm from motherfucking Y-O
Where the niggas is real and the bitches act like they know
You fuckin ho, you know I know
Cause my mutherfucking man Knock told me so
So did Little Jo, Big Coup and Derrick
Wash from School Street and can't forget Eric
Ain't you tired of getting hit with dicks
You even fucked my man Charles Oakley from the Knicks
You shouldn't use sex to get away from ???
You got niggas trooping to Fordham Road
Just to drop a load
Bitch you shouldn't have hoe'd
Everybody got your code
The pussy is sold - and your ass and face
But I asked my man and he said it wasn't all that
Right about the time you were shopping the demo
He tore your ass up in the back of a limo
And you didn't even care
You left your mom in Schlobohm - on what WELFARE
Bitch you know you ain't right
Matter fact what are you doing at about 8 o'clock tonight
You got the boots and I'm coming to get 'em
Is it true that after you fuck 'em, you'll make a record with him
If so then I'll be there and it won't be hard to find me
Cause like I said before Mary J - You Remind Me!
Yeah
Yo, remix joint...
(I gots to make a move and make it soon
I gots to take a block and make it boom)x2
Goin Against the grain... Know what im sayin? Ye-yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, shit's about to jump off and
Lookin' for the bus to bring in my man from up north
Been like three years since when got knocked
Since he got caught
Pumped up like five new blocks, holding down for it
Kept a nigga straight with money in the books
And them bitches is crooks who look out for other crooks
Took him shopping, money in his pocket is straight
Dropped him off at the wife's crib after we ate
Our estate was the next move for me
Had to make that nigga chill for at least two to three months
Cause when it's on, it's on (thats my plate!)
He didn't care
It's like slow down baby
The money ain't going nowhere (what?)
Keep in touch though and show how much your ass is with it
The dope flow is there and in a minute you can get it
Watch a nigga just coming home in a game
Cause on the low we may just be trying to go (go down) against the grain
I gots to make a move and make it soon (uh-huh!)
I gots to take a block and make it boom (come on!)
I gots to make a move and make it soon (what?)
I gots to take a block and make it boom (come on!)

I never figured this nigga would pull this shit that he pulled
What is strange is the change that niggas go through
When they're locked down and really can't hack it
A motherfucker like me handles a bid like a jacket
Strap it on my back, niggas ain't built like me
And by the end, niggas was like "Yo, why you killed Mike, D?
Wasn't me, but yeah he had it coming to him
Used to be my man, so I let my cousin do him (we open up shop! It's four in the mornin!)
Sent him out of state with like half a brick down to my spot in VA
Cause the money comes quick
Half of that got fucked up before I even got the check in on him
Mistakes happen so I really wasn't wreckin' on him
Got him up out of there and sent him down a little further
Ain't heard from him in two months, murder, murder (aahhh!)
And from the next flight thinking I might have to steal something
This hungry shit will make a nigga wanna kill something (fo-fo!)

I gots to make a move and make it soon (uh-huh!)
I gots to take a block and make it boom (come on!)
I gots to make a move and make it soon (what?)
I gots to take a block and make it boom (come on!)
Man, listen, money is missing and shit is hectic
Found the safe, checked it
Shit looks detected
Just what I expected when I got no word from him
Asked around but ain't nobody heard from him (cash long!)
But money talks and most niggas is snakes
So it wasn't long before his man was ready to take
Me to where he was at, checked my gat
Threw in a four clip, pumped myself up
Cause I can't go for that bullshit
Fuckin' with my last load of cash ain't the issue
It's just real fucked up when your man tries to diss you
Takin' back for niggas in New York and how they told me so
Now I got to knock his boots, he owes me dough
Layin' up with a hoe, then he hit me with the sob story
The famous "Oh you didn't know I got robbed!" story
Told it's to me he should be grateful to
Fuck that bitch! Look at what she made you do
Now there's love lost and a double cross
Pointed at that bitch, turned her braids into sauce
So you wanna be with him (uh) and talk to me like I'm silly
Five bottle of Mo on the floor, boxes of phillys
Ten g's in the shoebox under the bed
And for every g I put a fuckin' slug in his head
And from then, the moral of the story if you missed it
Is the grain will always gonna be there (why nigga?)
Just never go against it
The best of y'all niggas remind me of myself when I was younger
When it was hunger that stopped the nigga from going under
And you wonder, why I pat you on your head, smile
Look in your eyes and thank the lord for my child
Meanwhile, something I gotta show you an I hope you can take it
Gonna leave you in the desert, an I hope that you make it
Gotta put you on your ass to see what it does to you
When you stand up an see that I'm just showin' love to you
Other niggas would put a slug through you, over your ends
Caps I fucked with are real, but hey
Those are your friends
Its just what you got coming sometimes you don't know
What you asking for, did you ask for more?
Should the casket door swing here, it is done
An thought you was a killer, you swore you'd never run
Nigga died with his gun still up in the holster
It is comin' in the air? Yeah its getting' closer

I see life through many shades of grays and blacks
I could take that an hit 'em with the blazin' tracks
When I make that you fake cats have violent dreams
Takes another dog to be able to hear my silent screams
The devil got a hold on me an he won't let go
I can feel the lord pullin' but he movin' dead slow
Let 'em know that amidst all this confusion
Some of us may do the winnin'
But we all do the losin' its just who does the choosin'
Easy goin up or down what have you been provin'?
Jus that you were fuckin' ground
Bitch seen the bullshit, but never spoke on it
An I know that deep down you really don't want it
I woulda traded the chance of bein' the child with a father
Movin' talent and bein' able to survive when its harder
My balance on the high beams of life, keep my dreams in strife
That's why I hit these motherfuckin' streets at night
Come on!
There's a lotta shit that I let slide, cuz its outta my hands
Lotta niggas I let ride, but its not in my plans
An a lot of my mans is not seein' through the fog
Families by the truckload, fleein' them to the morgue
Full moon, arooooo, the howlin', grrrrrrr
An growlin', shhhhhh, an prowlin'
Don't know love, can't show love
That means you gonna need more love
Than on old thug, but hold up, roll up
Talkin' out the side of your mouth is
What's gonna is what's gonna let niggas know
Why you bad in your house, an they lie up to your spouse
Told her it was suicide, but you an I
Both knew the truth, for we'd never die
Listen nigga, if you scared, get a dog, but be prepared, for the mob
Cuz you dead up in the fog, an that's your head by the log
I can smell it in the air, I can tell when its there
This is hell an we both here
Can you feel it? Tell me yeah
Ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo!
There's wild MCs that day,  you knowmsayin
I give props to, niggas is nice, you knowmsayin?
But on the real, y'all niggas know!
That them niggas is not fuckin with me
You knowmsayin?
Any MC that disagree with me
Wave your motherfuckin arm
Cuz it can happen!

It ain't no secret 'bout how its going down once I put on the pressure
It ain't nothing but another nigga put on a stretcher
With a blanket over his face, take him to the morgue with the waste
'Cuz he was in the wrong place at the wrong time
So I gave it to him in his chest
In his throat, in his head, in his back, through his vest, yes
Ain't a whole lot to breaking a nigga down fast
They call me black 'cuz thats how I'm gon' be on that ass
Y'all pussy niggas think y'all sweet
But ain't a fuckin thing going down til I eat
So kill that beef? You betta while you still got teeth
'Cuz they about to get knocked out, hopped out
On that ass with a blast that'll make ya shit drop out
Popped out, through a you know what
Cuz you know why, and you know my
Motherfuckin name up in this game
And bitch, you know I
Will never be caught slippin', but on some east coast terms
New York niggas do, fuck the perms
They talk about the hawk is out because it's stiffy
They know the flow is riffy, crush more nuts than Skippy
It's the dog with the bark of a Devil's arm
Don't even play yourself, cause you ain't on my level, hog
Niggas get ate up, straight up, so bring another plate up
When I bitch slap a rapper if he can't hold his weight up
Last nigga was lucky, he only got mushed
I have the niggas falling off like they got pushed
And I get flows, straight from the get-go
Hit a nigga wit' fo rounds, that's split yo stomach
Coming through niggas like an obstacle course
A lot to in source, give props to the boss
Unstoppable force, take it as a loss
That's what you get for getting fly with niggas
Roll with niggas niggas cause you cool with niggas
And you'll die with niggas, don't try this nigga
Cause I'm possessed bust a hole through his vest
Into his chest, strap your boots cause I'm stressed
Niggas is puss
Keep me runnin from the werewolf, owww
Howling at the moon on the roof
Eh, ah, no, get em
Ten niggas on him, hope God's with him
Give me the bat, let me split him
I'll have em where the pillow and the casket won't fit him (Wooo!)
Only reason I did him, he wouldn't fight back
Trieed to strike back
Left him like that, layin up with the white hat
Gettin right back at ya when I snatch ya (Aight!)
Up out the grave, nuthin but bones and ashes
Hittin niggas with gashes to the head
Straight to the white meat but the street stay red (Heeey!)
But this girl gave me head for free
Cause they see, who I'ma be by like 2003 (2003!)
That Nigga D took it there
He thought it was a joke
He went through like 20 G's and thought that
I was broke, stupid
That's what you get for thinkin and eventually
Found that's what you get for stinkin
Blowin up the spot when you rot
Plus if it gets hot they know you dipped
For four squared blocks
Hit em with the ox to the grill
Eh, ah, kill nigga kill
Yet still they don't know I'ma rob who
That dog DMX is a muthafuckin problem
Know what Im sayin? Keepin it real
I've been through mad stress, man

But soon as shit hit the fan, honies be wanna take the kid and scram
I'm having bad thoughts, don't like how dark it's getting man
From the time I wake up and get dressed

It's 96, so I'm on some different shit cousin
She ain't gon have me liftin through that riffin shit buggin'
I got moves to make and mad shit to do
Her friends are looking good so I might hit the crew
It's like one and two that might get a nigga that big and happy
And I know them bitches will fuck me cause when I see 'em, they be winkin at me
You listenin thinkin that's a crazy brother
But I'm gon have to be a father who ain't fuckin with his baby motha

Got me like "Yo, I ain't fuckin with that bitch no more"
She know i love her but I can't fuck with her
She thinkin cause we got a kid together, I'm stuck with her

Bitches be callin the cops, thinkin they callin the shots
Takin the good with the bad baby, it's all in the pot
So do yo thing, cause I'm doin mine boo
A nigga just been chillin, I been doin fine, and you?
I kicked it with my honey and she put me on to something
You gon think until you really see me gon, I'm frontin
Maybe if you kept your friends of respectable distance
Out of our business, I wouldn't have to come and visit
I thought you knew, let the shit you like switchin clothes
When a bitches crew ain't too kosher with they hoes
But that ain't never stopped yo ass from passin on the Guess
Askin for that Cougie sweater, patten up the breast
Patten up the butt, but you think niggas is stupid
Last week yo shit was like the door, look at it now, too big
I ain't gon blow yo shit no more, I shouldn't be even did that
Cause you my baby motha, and I'ma always hit that
My baby motha be buggin soon as I walked in the door

She know i love her but I can't fuck with her
She thinkin cause we got a kid together, I'm stuck with her
My baby motha be buggin soon as I walked in the door
Got me like "Yo, I ain't fuckin with that bitch no more"
She know i love her but I can't fuck with her
She thinkin cause we got a kid together, I'm stuck with her

My baby motha be buggin soon as I walked in the door
Got me like "Yo, I ain't fuckin with this bitch no more"
Give me a Puerto Rican honey that cook rice and beans
And hair down to her ass, who looks nice in them jeans
So I can be like "Damn, you looking good and I wanna fuck you"
But you a chicken so when I'm finish, I got a duck you
You layin like up you don't wanna leave
I told you I got a girl but you don't wanna believe
My baby's mother be buggin and if you wanna see what honey do
Be here when she get back, she bless you with the twenty-two
But ain't even fuck with her like that
Cuz i know, this is the only thing that make her fight that
If you a schemin nigga, go head try your hand
She might give the number, but you'll never be the man
Even if you get the pussy, you besta fuck her some place
Because if my son knows your name, I'ma take your health
My baby motha be buggin soon as I walked in the door
Got me like "Yo, I ain't fuckin with that bitch no more"

She know i love her but I can't fuck with her
She thinkin cause we got a kid together, I'm stuck with her
Got me on the run
Uh, uh

Boom, boom, boom, open the door, atf
To late to send my girl downstairs to say he left
To the basement, go through the replacement door
Come up in my neighbor's yard, wit' a taste for war
You know I laced the four, wit' the hallows
Crack the safe, got the bottles
Whatchu want me to do?
Beep carlos!
Two houses over by the tall black fence
I keep the hooptie parked for situations like this
There go a priest, yo, get in, you drive
What the f**k you doin nigga?
Tryin to stay alive
Cops on every corner, I lay back and try to cruise by
Who the f**k could'a snitched? must'a been a new guy
Damn, in back on our ass
Put your foot back on the gas, step on it fast
Tryin' to pull up on the side, but I'm packin' to blast
Tryin' to take the niggas heads off, f**k crackin' the glass
Hey, look out, (bark), damn
Came so close, you almost hit that bitch
Like you said nigga, almost
Shit, the cops hit her, and I know they ain't gon' leave her
Go up here, make this left, pull it over, take a breather
(breathing sounds)
Drop it on the floor, boom
Got it through the door, peddle to the floor, an office line
Death is in the air, and I don't know if it's mine
But I know if it's time, it'll be what it is
And all I can think of is what about my kids
Shit, they on the corner, hit the sidewalk, quick!
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 more clips
Hit the fire hydrant, get low for the shootout
Run through the fire, pull a gun from my boot out
Caught me in the shoulder, the neck, the ear
I'm goin' out fast and the last thing I hear is
Boom, boom, boom, open the door, atf
"Hey yo, let me know I'm saying, if you recording when the beat come in"
"I'm recording right now motherfucker"
"Hey yo, niggas can't touch me kid"
"What was that god?"
"I said niggas can't touch me kid."

[Intro: DMX]
Uhhh...aha..

[Hook: DMX]
Niggas can't touch me kid
Niggas can't touch me kid
Niggas can't touch me kid
Niggas can't touch me kid

[Verse 1: DMX]
Ain't no way for me to say just how deep the flow gets
Still waking up in cold sweats, over old threats
And I done did more time than a clock
From the Valhalla to the Rock
I represent on every block
Its the Dizark! Straight out the Grizound!
And from now on this is how Shizits going Dizown!
Clizown, come through squashing toes
Don't even breathe cause in jail you was washing clothes
Get in front of hoes and start fakin' G
Let you tell it, you getting dough like a bakery
Making me scheme and plot
Since yo ass like to dream I put that head to bed and you can dream a lot
Funny shit is before I shot tha nigga, you shoulda seen how the bitch came up out the nigga
Now I got the nigga but I could run up in 'em made 'em say "Daddy" before I put the gun up in 'em
Put one up in 'em, two three, empty the clip
Have his whole head looking like a busted lip
And I skip, cause I can't stand another case
Went to his wake so I could laugh at the look on his mother's face
Even though I know it ain't shit funny about knocking a nigga off just to get money
I still do what I gots to and just be grateful that I never got you cause I woulda SHOT YOU!

[Hook 4X]

[Verse 2: DMX]
Yeah, you know how I'm living nigga
Straight up ruthless, let's leave yo man toothless, ain't nothing given nigga
I been cruddy cause just long as I can remember since 1970 the 18 of December
Earl Simmons, the bastard that nobody wanted was born
Niggas showed me a joint made 'em run it, it's on
Can't a bank around the way say I ain't stuck it
Quick as I catch a body I can be one, so fuck it!
I ain't got shit to lose but my life
Plug you in the gut and watch the blood ooze down my knife
I laugh at death cause to me it's funny
Don't give a fuck about shit, what matters to me is money!
Sonny, I could teach yo ass a trick or two about stacking the dough, macking a hoe and what the dick'll do
I drove a bitch until the bitch is worthless
Have her sucking my mans dick and make it look good on the surface
A nigga get the same treatment
I'm leaving guts on walls, and brains all over the cement
But no remorse for the corpse cause I still kick 'em
He ain't bleeding enough so I stick 'em
And I will have another body
Kinda like how I feel when I'm blowing up another party
And shit is clicking in the hood now so I'm good now
Talking bout you good now
Oh, you would? How?

[Hook 4X]

[Verse 3: DMX]
Plenty of niggas know dirty is how I do 'em
Push buck shots from a 30 right through 'em
Cause ain't none of ya'll motherfuckers built for war
And I lay down the law when I spray down ya door
Fuck around and my name'll be 19 5 be 64 11
On the 3 and a half to 7
But even up north I put niggas to waste so if you wanna stop the violence
GET THE FUCK OUT MY FACE!
Paroled in four, peeps hit the board off
Bitches is fucking but I sleeps with the sawed off!
I got shit to do, crews to break, moves to make
Wait for the news to break, I got dues to take
I don't joke cuz jokers is cards
And cards are what I pull
Infrared with the clip full, no leash on my pitbull
This shit is hot like the wax off a candle stick
But how I handle shit, is to dismantle shit (Dundundundunduhdada)
Like Popeye when it's spinach time, running through niggas like your tape at the finish line
What ya crew gonna do when I put the pressure on?
And it hurts wanna be gangstas in skirts?
And the bitch is coming all up out the nigga!
One false move and they mom's will read about the nigga
And they girls will be without the nigga
Matter fact, I'm tired of talking money throw ya joints up, let's scrap

[Hook]

"Can't touch me kid...word up...
Can't touch me kid...word up...
They can't touch me kid!
Word like can't touch me kid
Word to mans can't touch me kid
Cuz I get big can't touch me kid
Cuz that's how it is can't touch me kid
I lives how I lives can't touch me kid
Fresh off a bid can't touch me kid
Get the body and slid can't touch me kid
Yo I did what I did can't touch me kid
Now who get big? can't touch me kid!

"Uhhhhh....HAHA!! AHHHHH!!"
When I creep through
Niggas is see through
Just like negligee
Ain't no talkin cause there ain't much that the dead can say
Long as I'm walking I be strappin my dogs
Rackin the hogs
Desert Eagle packin the morgues
Metal slabs with yellow tags on toes it's
What happens to those that
Chose to be foes and
Bet his man knows
But yo, we only get stronger
And the amount of time we're facing is only gettin longer
Get the mayor on the horn!
It's time for shit to go down
Strapped for the show down
Wet up yo crib, kick the door down
Know you schemin' so I gots to get you first
Put you right up in a brand new hearse
Could be worse
Shoulda seen what I gave this nigga
Two vests couldn't save this nigga
The way I laid this nigga
Played this nigga
But that's what I'm good at
Layin niggas out in fightin' pits and fuckin' hoodrats
Where's my fuckin' hood at?
I flip on niggas like snitches
Rip on niggas like bitches
Then pour niggas in ditches
They ain't found half the bodies that a nigga caught
Or should I say a nigga bought
Cause ain't nothing like getting' paid for, a nigga sport
Triple what a nigga thought
But that's just how shit be
I know that one day they gon' try that shit wit me
But just as long as I'm on top of shit
I ain't stoppin shit
And ain't a motherfucker droppin' shit
Sat shorty down and told him how much his peeps missed him
Boom, one shot through his respiratory system
Kissed him good night, put him to bed
Put four mo to the head, so he know he understood what I said
Red was all over the place, it didn't look good
But I did what a crook would, searched the crib and took goods
And every night it's the stress
That makes me put another nigga to rest
Make another nigga one less

[Verse]
Niggas say I'm bugging
And ask me what's that shit I'm on
Cause I did them wrong
Carry greasy, and get 'em gone
What I'm on is some real "fuck the world" shit
And hoes like the cruddy
So I'll fuck your girl, quick
That nigga Earl sick
That's what they used to say in school
Throwing chairs, and digging niggas with pencils everyday in school
A wise man can play the fool for reasons of his own
I knew that I would understand them reasons when I'm grown
And now it's on
They started something they wasn't ready for
At the age of 10 I'm busting down a steady four
Comin out for visit but what's a visit when there's no home?
Other kids' parents like 'this little boy's so grown!'
I am what happens when you're raised in the streets
All I really want is to get praised in the streets
And he who lays in the streets with your last breath
Ask the Lord for forgiveness and you may have a fast death
It's not like me to have my back turned to open places
I wanna see it when it's comin, so I can open faces
Open cases got me payin to stay out of jail
While these streets, got me to prayin to stay out of hell
Slipped, and I fell, got back up - slipped again
But no matter what it's been, niggas never got a win
It's a thin line I walk, everyday but I'm good with it
Project nigga all my life, but wouldn't say the hood did it
Knew what I was doin, everyday that I've been doin it
Seein niggas havin a good time, so i'ma ruin it
Fuck you, and fuck your man, both y'all niggas is puss!
Frontin like you out the jungle but ain't never seen a bush
When push comes to shove, whatever love we had take it witchu
Now peep what I just said and see how long it takes to hit you
Everybody knows you can talk all day
But when it's on what you gonna do - walk away?
One love Boomer, rest in peace, baby!
Dark Man X, DMX
Hit me dog. I'll start from some motherfuckin old school shit first
Ima hit em with some old school shit

I'm on some shit like dog...
School street is schoolin
You could be blind
But you gon' see it when you need to see it
You gon' be fine
'Cause you gon' be here when you need to be here
One of a kind
First free your mind, and then you'll free your spirit
Go where I go, dog in my life
You could be blind
But you gon' see it when you need to see it
You gon' be fine
'Cause you gon' be here when you need to be here
One of a kind
First free your mind, and then you'll free your spirit
Go where I go, dog in my life
Now if you start with dirt, then you start with hurt
You start with "Oh, you ain't got?"
Well here, take my shirt
Start with work, blood and tears over the years
Goin' through whatever we go through, we stickin' it out here
Pups turn into dogs, tadpoles into frogs
I'm just eatin' what's in front of me, ain't thinking about yours
But I'ma keep my paws on what's mine
Beg 'til I find
Strapped 'til I'm blind
A nigga that whatever I do, still gon' be able to spit this
I'm wit' this, 'cause this is mine, you scared shitless
Rap niggas can't fuck with the dog
Never, could be twenty below outside
I'm built for the weather
It could be hotter than lava, I wouldn't bother to sweat
Some of you niggas, form a following, but you startin' to forget
I paid my dues, not only did you not wear
But you would really love it
If you could meet that cat that made my shoes
C'mon
You could be blind
But you gon' see it when you need to see it
You gon' be fine
'Cause you gon' be here when you need to be here
One of a kind
First free your mind, and then you'll free your spirit
Go where I go, dog in my life
You could be blind
But you gon' see it when you need to see it
You gon' be fine
'Cause you gon' be here when you need to be here
One of a kind
First free your mind, and then you'll free your spirit
Go where I go, dog in my life
Now see, what I do is peep shit, keep shit low
Keep paying attention to what you trying to show me
Livin', but you never know, we livin'
Don't give me what you don't owe me
Don't tell me that you love me
Don't talk shit, don't kill me slowly
'Cause a dog like me, is an only
Meaning, hit another like you, truth hurts, but I can't be phony
You always looking for bad, look at you mad
But you won't be satisfied 'til it took what you had
(Aight) I'm a thoro nigga, I keep my word
And anybody that's ever met me, got love for me
So I keep a heard
And that shit y'all niggas told me got me fucked up in the head
Went from, "Yo, that's my dog"
To, "Yeah, that nigga dead"
What the fuck is all this?
News to me
Dog it's like shit ain't what it used to be
See some niggas choose to be on the other side of the fence
Keep riding with this, get fried in the mix
C'mon
You could be blind
But you gon' see it when you need to see it
You gon' be fine
'Cause you gon' be here when you need to be here
One of a kind
First free your mind, and then you'll free your spirit
Go where I go, dog in my life
You could be blind
But you gon' see it when you need to see it
You gon' be fine
'Cause you gon' be here when you need to be here
One of a kind
First free your mind, and then you'll free your spirit
Go where I go, dog in my life
Now if it ain't that, then don't say that
'Cause I don't play that, y'all play that
But the poke ain't black, damn, why you say that?
I thought that what?
Nevermind, I just thought it
We supposed to keep it real
I destroy what I was taught
Misery, love, company
Now you niggas talikin' 'bout jumpin' me, pumpin' me
Full of slugs, blood, stud with the love
Damn, I just gave, what a real, nigga does
Don't listen to the buzz, don't get caught up in the hype
You'll lose everything that you worked for
Trying to take a nigga's stripes
Live life through life, and so on and so on
That's when the grow on, man, get your flow on

First free your mind, and then you'll free your spirit
Go where I go, dog in my life

[Verse 1]
She said, "Oh"
She said, "Woo"
I said, "So?"
She said, "No"
She said, "Go, you got to go"
I said, "I know"
She said, "No"

[Bridge]
And every time I'm with this chick
We fuck like we in a relationship

"Hey"
She said, "Hey"
I said, "Pay"
She said, "No Way"
I said, "Stay"
She said, "Wait"
She said, "Pay"
She said, "Stay"
Yeah

[Bridge]
And every time I'm with this chick
We fuck like we in a relationship
I want to play forever, but

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
To meet a new friend
Just to find myself, I hide myself
Girl, so I guess I pretend
Like I'm into me
And the game open, with
The Tina's and the Gina's
The Lisa's and Teresa's
The Keyshia's and Alishia's, yeah
The Judy's and the Suzy's

Again, again
I love them then leave them come back and then leave them again
Again (x6)
I love them then leave them come back and then leave them again
Again (x3)

[Verse 1]
You taught me everything
Everything you've given me
I'll always keep it inside
You're the driving force in my life, yeah
There isn't anything
Or anyone that I could be
And it just wouldn't feel right
If I didn't have you by my side
You were there for me to love and care for me
When skies were gray
Whenever I was down
You were always there to comfort me
And no one else can be
What you have been to me you will always be
You will always be the girl
In my life for all times

[Chorus]
Mama, Mama you know I love you
Mama, Mama you're the queen of my heart
Your love is like tears from the stars
Mama I just want you to know
Lovin' you is like food to my soul

[Verse 2]
You're always down for me
Have always been around for me even when I was bad
You showed me right from my wrong
Yes you did
And you took up for me
When everyone was downin' me
You always did understand
You gave me strength to go on
There ware so many times
Looking back when I was so afraid
And then you come to me and say to me
I can face anything
And no one else can do
What you have done for me
You'll always be, you will always be
The girl in my life, ooh oh

[Chorus]
Mama, Mama you know I love you
Mama, Mama you're the queen of my heart
Your love is like tears from the stars
(Your love is like tears from the stars)
Mama I just want you to know
(Mama I just want you to know)
Lovin' you is like food to my soul

[Bridge]
Never gonna go a day without you
Fills me up just thinkin' about you
I'll never go a day
Without my mama

[Chorus]
Mama, Mama you know I love you
Mama, Mama you're the queen of my heart
Your love is like tears from the stars
(Like tears from the stars)
Mama I just want you to know
Lovin' you is like food to my soul

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oohh
Food to my soul

[Hook]
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru

[Verse 1]
I can't recall the last time I took advice from anyone
Shaped a figure eight, who trust pretty girls anyways?
I can't recall the last time I took advice from anyone
I'm sure I'll be the death of me
And I can't recall the last time I took love from anyone
I called daddy, who's got one anyways?
Not me

[Bridge]
Are you hating yourself?
Do you really hate me?
Are you hating yourself?

Was it worth it?
Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired (of) always making amends? (ohhhh)
I know you hate me now (here)
I bet you hate me now (here)
Bring on the thorny crown (here)
Crucify me

[Verse 2]
I'm really over the cryin' thing, wipin' my tears
Who cries anyway, spread like disease all over me
We did ungodly ghastly things, last night I mean
Who's God anyway?
You're mine any day
It's burning
Take me
I wanna feel
Your power
This final hour
Tell me

[Bridge]
Are you losing yourself?
Will you lose it for me?
Are you losing yourself?

Was it worth it?
Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired (of) always making amends? (ohhhh)
I know you hate me now (here)
I bet you hate me now (here)
Bring on the thorny crown (here)
Crucify me

[Hook (2X)]
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru

[Intro: Kanye West]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I got 'em, Young Carter
On the A-team if it's in alphabetical order
Used to daydream about Benzes and Porches
And by 18, I had a Benz and a Porsche, ha!
I'm so used to stuntin' on y'all
So tired of ballin', excuse me if I yawn
Ha! But I know what I'm doing
Out the window of the jet, you see L.A. like a Bruin, ha
New coupe, foot to the floor
Weather man make it rain, turn sugar to snow, you know
Ha! But watch how you speak
Cause in the street you can't trust every smile you meet, heh
And you ain’t important as the new edition is
Ralph Tresvant, ooh, they so sensitive
And it's the remix, baby!
And I'm a knock it out like Felix, baby, haha
God damn I'm fly
And my troop so cool, I don't have to lie
Hop in my car and go Kanye West
With my groovy new Louis Vuitton Damier vest
Ha! Yeah, let 'em hate though
I'm on my way to the bank, LMAO (wassup?)

[Hook: Kanye West]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
It's one of the best to touch microphones
That'll spit the kind of shit to put the earth in a type of zone, like
To make 'em laugh or make 'em cry
Bring a life into existence or cause you to die
Now when I was a shorty and when my mom called me precious
I realized I'm outspoken and every word was infectious
I'm sayin', Mommy said God'll bless us
No matter the difficulties or how much it would stress us
I'm sayin', no matter how hard I try
To understand if I behave that I'll see God when I die, man
These words'll dawn on me, why?
Cause no one came back from death to say if it's truth or it's lies
See the point that I'm makin' is that she knew I was blessed
And comin' to life as a legend, the man of best in the flesh
I kiss my mother, countin' figures
Thinkin 'back on when I used to tell niggas, they sayin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Yeah, homie this a theme song
First I get my money right, then I get my team on
If I always pray to have gleam on
$300 jeans on, do that mean I dream wrong?
And I was high as a Learjet
Fly as the insect, even though we in debt
And it don't matter if I get her number
Cause when I get my money right she gon' come running
And I'll be good like "God" with an extra "O"
God knows that my check needs some extra 0's
And you know that you need to bring some extra hoes
Not in jogging pants either, tell them wear some sexy clothes
Now my game so professional
And my chain so fresh, they go (oh oh oh oh oh)
Right after the fame did you gain anything?
Damn Ye, would you change anything?
But (If I had a billion dollars)
I'd cop more pink polos and pop those collars
Misery love company, her nickname Sorrow
My Benz need company, her nickname Tahoe
“Wait 'til  get my money,” everybody motto
So I'mma need a bravo for everything I wrote
Yeah, hey mama they can't hate him
Cause after all of the drama, K slayed 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

[Chorus 1]
Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

[Verse 2]
Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play

[Chorus 2]
Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
I used to shoot you down

[Bridge]
Music played and people sang
Not for me not church bells ring

[Verse 3]
Now he's gone I don't know why
Until this day, sometimes I cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie

[Chorus 3]
Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, he hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
My baby shot me down
All these feelings I'm tired of them
Ruling over my life again
Emotions aren't my friend
I keep them ordered as best I can

I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Layman, workman, his man, her man
How about about the weather?

All these people I'm tired of them
Sifting into my life again
Their questions, the "how and when"
I try and answer the best that I can but

I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Layman, workman, his man, her man
How about about the weather?

All my worries, they come and go
They tend to leave when I let you know
On bad days I take it slow
I try to dance when I hit a low
I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Hit man, burn man, his man, her man
It will all get better

Oh, the days they go so fast
I can't believe what is in my past
The future's here at last
I don't need to have what she has

I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Hit man, burn man, his man, her man
It will all get better

Sing it out, sing it loud
Sing it out, sing it loud
Be proud, come out
Be proud, come out

I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Hit man, burn man, his man, her man
We can make it better, yeah
We will have it better

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I let your main ho suck me up from ground zero
Ridin' round tryna get it, I got kilos

So well I can hold a nine like Rondo
But I'ma wear a five like Flacco

And I'm a bear and my car is rare
And my ho's from there (right where?) right there

And a four, and a four, and another four
Four by four on 24's

My Aunt could still smoke blow

MPA and Brick Squad, you know we some weirdos
We don't wear nothin' but Versace, we don't wanna wear Polo
Oh no, oh no, if I had a group, I'd go solo
Solo, I'm so dope, if it was a group, I'd go solo

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Shooting star, shooting star, every car I got is a shooting car

Can't move me, salute me, or shoot me nigga
Your girlfriend said she wanna do me nigga
We in Hollywood and you lost me nigga
Don't have the gun? Gonna cost you nigga
I'mma keep my scrubber off that nigga
Hey now steady, hand's off me nigga
Might not have a chance to get a shot off nigga
Got two young niggas call them sawed off killers
Got two old niggas call them butcher knife killers

[Verse 4: Young Thug]
Understand  me motherfucker? I'm a habitat
Got 100 racks built, that's a habitat
And I love to rap, that's a habitat
Beat his ass with 100 bats, that's a habitat
And he's trippin' now, aka king rap
Dealing with the Feds, coming home on curfew
Why?
I ain't talkin' bout no hospital but I see you
(That's what I do)

[Hook: Young Thug]
Guwop, hey bro

Told that ho that I'm a shootin' star just wish away
I done upped my features, ionno what to charge today
Ayyyyyy, ahyyyyyyy

[Verse 1]
I find it hard to say bye-bye
Even in the state of you and I
And how can I refuse?
Yeah you rid me of the blues
Ever since you came into my life

[Chorus]
Because you're my medicine
(Yeah, you're medicine)
Yeah, you're my medicine
(Yeah, you're medicine)
(Yeah, you're medicine)

[Verse 2]
I, I wanna marry you
Said, "I, I adore you"
And that's all I have to say, "bye-bye"
And you opiate this hazy head of mine

[Chorus]
Because you're my medicine
(Yeah, you're medicine)
Yeah, you're my medicine
(Yeah, you're medicine)
(Yeah, you're medicine)
Because you're my medicine
(Yeah, you're medicine)
Yeah, you're my medicine
(Yeah, you're medicine)
Yeah, you're my medicine

[Verse 1]
She moved with shameless wonder
The perfect creature rarely seen
Since some liar brought the thunder
When the land was godless and free
Her eyes look sharp and steady
Into the empty parts of me
But still my heart is heavy
With the hate of some other man's beliefs

[Pre-Chorus]
Always a well dressed fraud
Who wouldn't spare the rod
Never for me

[Chorus]
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
The purest expression of grief

[Verse 2]
Wondering who I copy
Mustering some tender charm
She feels no control of her body
She feels no safety in my arms
I've no language left to say it
But all I do is quake to her
Breaking if I try convey it
The broken love I make to her

[Pre-Chorus]
All that I've been taught
And every word I've got
Is foreign to me

[Chorus]
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
The purest expression of grief

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
The purest expression of grief
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
The purest expression of grief

[Intro]

[Intro Skit]
I had to complete Mazinger Z. I had to, I had to
Why did you have to Grandfather?
To wreck all of Dr Hell's evil plans. Mazinger Z is clad in ultra alloy Z and is operated by photo atomic energy. It contains mighty weapons of all kinds. That robot is perfect. There is nothing to correct or adjust. Koji, Shiro, that robot is all yours. My only regret is that I cannot stay alive to watch you boys operate that robot. With Mazinger Z you can either become a God or a Devil. You'll be known as a super being. Now go!

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Sinister times, pacific the rims so I live in the mind
Sit in the head of the shit I design
Position it bent so I sit in recline
But never I sleep
Tears out the eyes is the weather I weep
Give cheddar to beggars to better my keep
Don't turn a back and never a cheek
Won't be here forever, we sever, we cease
A liar who said that we never release
Nooses surroundin' the neck of the beast
Loosing they pounds on the treasure beneath
200 pounds under pressure decrease
Reducing the sound to a set of beliefs
Devil's a trick like they sent the police
Is it or nah's (Nas) like wedded Kelis
So not the same like a Jet and a Jeep
One in the clouds, the other up under him running around
Unlike the one never touching the ground
Some like the one cause it doesn't come down
Unlike the oven that's under the town
Liquor the fire they jump in and drown
Wait till they die it's for something profound
Head is so dreaded for clutching the crown
And keeping it standing when jumping around
Feeding the animals, touching the hounds
Eating with cannibals, lunch in the lounge
Keeping it manual, clutch in announced
Eating the actual, reaping the benefits
Repeat the annual, bleeping the fouls
Something about (something about)
Reaching the valuable, touching the down

[Hook: PJ]
You came by yourself my darling
But you know we're not alone
Oh get yourself in order
Before they're calling you home
It could be wonderful
So tell me what is it you're waiting for?
No don't you go too far
Cause soon they'll be calling you home
They calling you home

(Either become a God or a Devil)
(Either be-, either become a God or a Devil)
Yeah you know they calling home
(God or a Devil, either be-, either become a God or a Devil)
Yeah you know they calling home

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Lovin' the Lord
Covet the lovers of governor or
Dozen in love with the covets or more
In concerts with converts-who-cover galore
Wash off they feet and then cover the floor
Mother the ships so come hover aboard
To raptures and ruptures start flooding the shore
Pushing and shoving and punching with oars
Thuggin' and judging, no plugging the holes
Sink to the bottom like sex in the kitchen, no food in the fridge but it's nut on the stove
It's what on the what?
Like Monica sucking and bust right on her clothes
Dishonouring Monica what is it for?
Monitor Monica, what does she know?
Finding the evidence, answering the questions
Did you and the president fuck on the low?
Room full of elephants, elegant elements, breaking it down she touching her toe
Triple A coming to give her a jump and her engine construction don't function no more
It's killing her options to live in a box when they filling their stockings with lumps of the coal
Finding the diamonds with dynamite, fighting the fire is hiding while wiping the pole
Sliding off slightly to siphon the go
She biting her neck like she vampire-like, ain't no lighten her load
With the tide and a bleach at the laundromat black trying to whiten her clothes
So maybe she can sneak into heaven, hmm yeah

[Hook]
You came by yourself my darling
But you know we're not alone
Oh get yourself in order
Before they're calling you home
It could be wonderful
So tell me what is it you're waiting for?
No don't you go too far
Cause soon they'll be calling you home
They calling you home

(Either become a God or a Devil)
(Either be-, either become a God or a Devil)
Yeah you know they calling home
(God or a Devil, either be-, either become a God or a Devil)
Yeah you know they calling home

[Outro]

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, won't you just listen?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Please
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I never really thought I'd be sitting here all alone
Staring down at the phone
Damn, what did I do that was so wrong?
And girl, I never thought you would move on
Can't believe you're gone
It's killing me, my heart ain't your home

[Pre-Chorus]
(So how?)
Thought I was the one but you done left me out
(And now)
And now

[Chorus]
Now I can't see nothing (Oh yeah)
And now my everything done turned to nothing (It's nothing, baby)
What can I do? What can I say? Nothing (Oh, nothing)
Wish I could've stopped you walking out
Should have screamed out loud (Oh, oh)
Baby, can't you hear me? (Can you hear me?)
Don't you miss me? (Miss me)
'Cause I'm hurting, girl, I wish that you could feel me (Yeah)
I guess there's nothing
Wish that you would talk to me or something (Yeah)
You ain't saying nothing, no

[Verse 2]
I never even gave you 100 percent
I never said what I meant, damn
Girl, I never thought you'd be burnt out, now my heart is breaking down
It's killing me, I can't save it and it's gone

[Pre-Chorus]
(So how?)
Thought I was the one but you done left me out
(And now)
And now

[Chorus]
Now I can't see nothing
And now my everything done turned to nothing (Everything done turned)
What can I do? What can I say? Nothing (Yeah)
Wish I could've stopped you walking out (Why did you walk out my life?)
Should have screamed out loud
Baby, can't you hear me? (Hear me)
Don't you miss me? (Miss me)
'Cause I'm hurting, girl, I wish that you could feel me
I guess there's nothing
Wish that you would talk to me or something (Yeah)
You ain't saying nothing, no

[Bridge]
One of the things I miss most is how you made me feel so right (Oh, oh)
And even though you're gone, I'm all alone, hey
I dream 'bout you day and night
Day and night (In my life), I'm breaking down
I'm wishing my baby was next to me
Can't you see? 'Cause I don't know who else to love (I don't know, oh)

[Chorus]
Now I can't see nothing
And now my everything done turned to nothing (Now I got nothing, woah-woah)
What can I do? What can I say? Nothing (Oh, what can I do? Oh)
Wish I could've stopped you walking out
Should have screamed out loud
Baby, can't you hear me? (Hear me)
Don't you miss me? (Miss me)
'Cause I'm hurting, girl, I wish that you could feel me (Feel me)
I guess there's nothing
Wish that you would talk to me or something (Oh, oh)
You ain't saying nothing, no
Nothing (No)
And now my everything done turned to nothing (No, no, no, no, no)
What can I do? What can I say? Nothing
Wish I could've stopped you walking out
Should have screamed out loud
Baby, can't you hear me?

[Intro: Miguel]
I keep dwellin' on the past, babe
Know what I need, yeah

[Chorus: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
It's better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
If that was true I wouldn't be drinking this alcohol
Every relationship failed to take a toll on you
Especially when you had hoes and area codes on you
Is it easier to erase my memories
At a point when most of my past women became my enemies?
Some on the fence, some befriended me
But when we see each other it's gon' be some weird energy
I'm sorry that we couldn't make it work
Believe in your heart, I never intended to make you hurt
Now they see me on the blogs with my new girl
Friends talking 'bout "that's supposed to be you, girl"

[Chorus: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I got a empty hole in my chest
How do I fill it? Somebody give a prescription
I guess I gotta learn to live with regrets
Pay for mistakes and your exes take a commission
But what's a percent off the top when you hit the bottom
After you break up wondering how to live without 'em?
Need solutions, less problems
Cause if love will drive you crazy I belong in the insane asylum
Hear the rain, feel the pain inside 'em
Kinda lost, need someone to guide 'em
It's nothin' worse than feelin' alone
But I'll admit to feelin' better when I'm hearing this song, it goes

[Chorus: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

[Bridge: Miguel]
So I, dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat, baby
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
On an empty bed
Dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
While I lose my mind
So you know what I need

[Chorus: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]

Here's the situation
Larce got shot now he facin'
Heaven or Hell but he livin' to tell
Who fuckin' did it
I got my crimie down with it
Just as grimy as me, slimy as me
Check it
I got a long list of names and addresses
Even know the store where his momma buy her dresses
She gon' be the first one to ride in a Hearse, son
Worse come to worst I'll kill his sister
I know he'll miss her
They dissed the family, other half of me
Them niggas scared of me, I hope they prepared to be
Shot at, hit up with baseball bats
Thrown in the back of the Ac with a trunk full of rats
Drive to Brooklyn, the back, take him to the pier (where?)
Way up in the back where the bums sleep at
Look him in the eye "You wanna die, don't ya?"
"If you could change everything you did ya would, won't ya?"
But you can't cause my brother can't breathe
Watchin' him bleed in the hospital, I had to leave
All I wanna do is kill your crew
Your grandmoms might get wet on the church house steps
The beef is set
Whatever
Show you the meaning of pressure
Killing faggot niggas like y'all for pleasure
You can't measure
The pain that's inside
Homicide
You can run but you can't hide
When the Benz with the tints in front of your residence
Everybody on the stoop gettin' bent
White Chalk-

[Verse 2: Craig G]

The nigga Blake told me
To be calm & breath slowly
Ya know me, I flip
Niggas was tryna hold me
Called the hospital lobby
The doctor said he pro'ly
Die, G
Arms taped-up with IVs
Heard he got blast an that shit surprised me
Larceny on his back - that's some shit I can't see
But I can see me puttin' you on TV
You and your crew
Channel 22 News, walkin' with some man's suit
With a 

[?]
In the bottom of the ocean, who the fuck you gon' tell?
Who tha fuck you gon' see that can outclass me?
Outlast me, stamina's nasty
Call Rayshawn's viper, Blake can call me a snake
How ya gonna act when you hear these .9's break?
Car doors close, trench coats open
Tommy gun's start smokin'
Leave you on a cold street chokin'
On your own blood
Fuck the jokin'
I ain't kiddin'
Mac spittin'
Niggas gettin' hit back flippin'
Wounded tryna flee, breakin' off full speed
Jumpin' over gates screamin' 'Fess it wasn't me
I see
The fear as I stare through the Cardier lenses
You ten yards ahead jumpin' fences
Breathin' mad hard beggin' God for forgiveness
But he ain't hearin' you
So I'ma end this
Fatality
Finished
Death is callin'
Who can hit you five times while you was callin'
White chalk started-

[Verse 1]
My head was warm
My skin was soaked
I called your name 'til the fever broke
When I awoke
The moon still hung
The night so black that the darkness hums

[Verse 2]
I raised myself
My legs were weak
I prayed my mind be good to me
An awful noise
Filled the air
I heard a scream in the woods somewhere

[Chorus]
Ooh, oo-ooh, oo-ooh

[Verse 3]
A woman's voice
I quickly ran
Into the trees with empty hands
A fox it was
He shook afraid
I spoke no words, no sound he made

[Verse 4]
His bone exposed
His hind was lame
I raised a stone to end his pain
What caused the wound?
How large the teeth?
I saw new eyes were watching me

[Chorus]
Ooh, oo-ooh, oo-ooh

[Verse 5]
The creature lunged
I turned and ran
To save a life I didn't have
Dear, in the chase
There as I flew
Forgot all prayers of joining you

[Verse 6]
I clutched my life
And wished it kept
My dearest love, I'm not done yet
How many years
I know I'll bear
I found something in the woods somewhere

[Chorus]
Ooh, oo-ooh, oo-ooh

[Verse 1]
You know better, babe, you know better, babe
Than to look at it, look at it like that
You know better, babe, you know better, babe
Than to talk to it, talk to it like that

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't give it a hand, offer it a soul
Honey, make this easy
Leave it to the land, this is what it knows
Honey, that's how it sleeps

[Chorus]
Don't let it in with no intention to keep it
Jesus Christ, don't be kind to it
Honey, don't feed it, it will come back

[Verse 2]
You know better, babe, you know better, babe
Than to smile at me, smile at me like that
You know better babe, you know better babe
Than to hold me just, hold me just like that

[Pre-Chorus]
I know who I am when I'm alone
I'm something else when I see you
You don't understand, you should never know
How easy you are to need

[Chorus 2]
Don't let me in with with no intention to keep me
Jesus Christ, don't be kind to me
Honey, don't feed me, I will come back

[Bridge]
It can't be unlearned
I've known the warmth of your doorways
Through the cold, I'll find my way back to you
Oh, please, give me mercy no more
That's a kindness you can't afford
I warn you, baby, each night, as sure as you're born
You'll hear me howling outside your door

[Outro]
Don't you hear me howling, babe?
Don't you hear me howling, babe?
Don't you hear me howling, babe?
Don't you hear me howling?
Don't you hear me howling?
Don't you hear me howling, babe?

I'll hold you down (We the best music), I'm on my way
My mama told me (you are) make sure you got a rider beside you
Even if you ain't have all the money, fame and the power huh
So I found her, fly shit to jump up out her
I pick her low valley, she rock with me, it don't matter

[Chorus: Usher]
There goes my baby
Together we're better, you're a breath of fresh air
Hold this ready and I'm round
You hold me down, I'mma hold you down
Now

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'mma get money, nigga, smell it on my gear
Black bottle, boy, baller hood billionaire (ah)
Boots in the mud, now it's marble floors (what)
Staircases to the roof look like it's heaven's door
Said a prayer for my woes who be dead and gone
How could I let you down if you never hit the phone? (ah)
Then they gave him all his money, make you go insane
We fucked the game, she said she knew that I would never change
Trap star, two bricks in the match box
Gold D's, fat boy, peanut butter top (wah)
I wanna spend a night with Jessica White (right)
But is a dopeboy really Jessica type?

[Hook: Usher]
There goes my baby
Together we're better, you're a breath of fresh air

She said he don't hold her down right

You gotta know your worth, baby, don't give 'em no discount
All of mine are dime, you see a nine, it was a miscount
And I'm the one to tell a bitch to bounce
I'm the one who getting this amount
I'm the one with this foreign shit
Name still getting mispronounced
Hold up, who you held down? When you ever put bail down?
I'mma keep picking money up like the motherfucker fell down
It's an us versus y'all thing, we a small gang
Just the two of us, baby, but we all bang
Bang, bang, bang like what set you claim
And when they asked me that, baby, you know I said your name

That's why you draped in designer, Chanel and all kind of shit
She with the realest and all 'em lames are too counterfeit
It's been a long time and she's still holding me down
(This the remix)
Nevermind the hoes I've been fucking with that's out of town (let's ride)
I have been through hell, had ups and downs
But in the long run still here
I apologize for when I be talking that freak shit in the air
She still moaning, I know you want it, I go to switching that gear
On everything, she never changed for real
That's why

I'll hold you remix (hold you down)

[Verse 1]
How many people rise and say
"My brain's so awfully glad to be here for yet another mindless day
Now, I've got all morning to obsessively accrue
A small nation of meaningful objects and they've gotta represent me too
By this afternoon, I'll live in debt
And by tomorrow, be replaced by children?"

[Verse 2]
How many people rise and think
"Oh good, the stranger's body's still here, our arrangement hasn't changed
Now, I've got a lifetime to consider all the ways
I grow more disappointing to you
As my beauty warps and fades
And I suspect you feel the same
When I was young, I dreamt of a passionate obligation to a roommate?"

[Pre-Chorus]
Is this the part where I get all I ever wanted?
Who said that?
Can I get my money back?

[Chorus 1]
Just a little bored in the USA
Oh, just a little bored in the USA
Save me, white Jesus
Bored in the USA

[Bridge]
Oh, they gave me a useless education
And a subprime loan on a craftsman home
Keep my prescriptions filled
And now I can't get off
But I can kind of deal
Oh, with being

[Chorus 2]
Bored in the USA
Oh, just a little bored in the USA
Save me, President Jesus
I'm bored in the USA
How did it happen?
Bored in the USA

[Verse 1]
Have you ever felt sad or lonely?
Have you ever felt two feet tall?
Have you ever thought, "Man, if only
I was anybody else at all"
They like to kick you when times get rough
And you give your all but it's not enough
And sticks and stones might break your bones
But words can break your heart
But if you don't know where to go
I'll show you where to start

[Chorus]
Kill yourself, it'll only take a minute
You'll be happy that you did it
Just go over to your oven and shove your head in it
Kill yourself, really you should do it
There's really nothing to it
Just grab a mug and chug a cup of lighter fluid

[Interlude]
Okay, now
I feel like you've pulled back
Maybe it's on account of the fact that I'm telling you to kill yourself over and over again
I'm just trying to make a simple point
That these.. that life's toughest problems don't have simple answers
You shouldn't just be brave
You shouldn't just roar
You shouldn't kill yourself
But I understand that
It's a sensitive subject and you're probably just hearing me say that
And I've dealt with s— I don't wanna be insen— look

[Verse 2]
I sound unempathetic
I sound mean and rude
Suicide is an epidemic
And I don't want to be misconstrued
Signs of depression go overlooked
So if you're depressed
Then you need to book a therapy session
Talk about your depression
And let a professional hear it
But if you search for moral wisdom in Katy Perry's lyrics, then

[Chorus]
Kill yourself, it won't be painful
If you are able
To give a little kiss to an oncoming train, you'll
Kill yourself, it's over, mull it
There's a trigger, pull it
Get it through your head, "it" being a bullet

[Outro]
Stick your tongue in a plug
Suck a pipe of exhaust
Make some toast in the tub
Nail yourself to a cross
Hold your breath 'til it's gone
Drink a gallon of mace
Be gay in Iran
Let Oprah sit on your face
Jump off of a bridge
Skinny dip in a flood
Sky dive attached to a fridge
Drink a Haitian guy's blood
Break into the zoo
Give the tiger a shove
Eat a Phillips head screw
Marry Courtney Love

[Spoken]
Don’t kill yourself

[audience laughing]
I don’t like explaining jokes that…the joke where I tell everyone to kill themselves might deserve an explanation. Do not! And if you’re offended, do not write a blog. I apologize immediately. Sorry! Right away!

[Mike Myers]: With the breach of three levees protecting New Orleans, the landscape of the city has changed dramatically, tragically, and perhaps irreversibly. There is now over twenty-five feet of water where there was once city streets and thriving neighbourhoods.

[Kanye West]: I hate the way they portray us in the media. If you see a black family, it says “they’re looting.” If you see a white family, it says “they’re looking for food.” And you know, it’s been five days because most of the people are black and even for me to complain about I would be a hypocrite because I’ve tried to turn away from the TV because it’s too hard to watch. I’ve even been shopping before even giving a donation.  So now I’m calling my business manager right now to see what’s… what is the biggest amount I can give and… and just to imagine if I was… if I was down there and those are… those are my people down there. So anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can help. With… with the setup, the way America is set up to help the…uh the uh, the poor, the… the black people, the uh… the less well-off as slow as possible. I mean, this is, Red Cross is doing everything they can. We… we already realize a lot of the people that could help are at war, right now, fighting another way, and they’ve… they’ve given them permission to go down and shoot us.

[Mike Myers]: And subtle and but in even many ways more profoundly devastating is the lasting damage to the survivors’ will to rebuild and remain in the area. The destruction of the spirit of the people of Southern Louisiana and Mississippi may end up being the most tragic loss of all.

[Kanye West]: George Bush doesn’t care about black people.

[Intro]
Lemme see, okay, I got something

[Verse 1]
Caught a contact high
I'm runnin' record labels 'til my contract bought
All in favor for this new shit, say aye
I'm a man, you a mannequin, don't fuck with fake guys
Hold up, nigga dope like a nigga slang pies
A nigga slang wood, she gon' feel it in her pipes
If the pussy good, get the ding-a-ling twice
'Cause my chain put them other pussy niggas on ice
I eat her booty, give the pussy hickies
Licky, licky, lookin' for a booty like Nicki's
Drum roll when I stick dick on top of titties
And your nigga 'bout to finish in a matter of minutes, I'm winnin'
I'm settin' world records, they should put me in Guinness
I'm 'bout to put my whole leg in it when I'm finished
She got me on my third leg in the ninth innin'
But when she kiss the head, my God, I'm finished
She got the body of a model, when I'm sippin' on the bottle
I'm about to spend the money on her
When she givin' me the neck, she gon' really get the check
Get the check like a money order
Got the Colombianas in the kitchen
Workin' with the soda, I ain't talkin' 'bout Coca-Cola
And all this money to the ceilin', I ain't worried 'bout the world
'Cause I got it sittin' on my shoulder
I don't fuck with you, pussy boy
I'm just fuckin' your pussy, nigga
Your bitch finna wire me my money right now
You paid for it, I'm the bookie, nigga
A hundred rounds comin' out the barrel of the drum
A cold nigga, your bitch fuckin' with a winner
Said she like fuckin' with a rich nigga
Every day Christmas but I fuck her in December
I don't fuck with your life, nigga
You can't fuck with these Nikes, nigga
I put your bitch in all white, nigga
And she do that shit you don't like, nigga
Ha, more liquor, now your bitch about to suck it
She givin' head to my niggas while I'm fuckin'
I got my Timberlands on with a bucket
Blowin' up her phone, she gon' pick up when I'm comin'
Ha, what you mean, we gon' talk out?
My nigga, we don't talk it out, my niggas with the shits though
Boy, you better walk it out before my niggas stomp you out
Lil' homie got the pistol
Ha, I'm takin' shots at the bar
After that, my niggas takin' shots at your car
I don't fuck with you, bitch nigga
I just fuck with your bitch, nigga
"The Prelude Pathétique"- First Part:
When I look back on my life it’s not that I don’t want to see things exactly as they happened, it’s just that I prefer to remember them in an artistic way. And truthfully the lie of it all is much more honest because I invented it. Clinical psychology tells us arguably that trauma is the ultimate killer. Memories are not recycled like atoms and particles in quantum physics. They can be lost forever. It’s sort of like my past is an unfinished painting and as the artist of that painting I must fill in all the ugly holes, and make it beautiful again. It’s not that I have been dishonest; it’s just that I loathe reality

For example those nurses, they're wearing next season Calvin Klein and so am I. And the shoes custom Giuseppe Zanotti. I tipped their gause caps to the side like Parisian berets because I think it's romantic, and I also think that mint will be very big in fashion next spring

Check out this nurse on the right; she's got a great ass. Bam

The truth is back at the clinic they only wore those funny hats to keep the blood out of their hair. And that girl on the left she ordered gummy bears and a knife a couple of hours ago, they only gave her the gummy bears. I'd wish they'd only given me the gummy bears

"The Prelude Pathétique"- Last Part:
You may say "I lost everything". But I still had my Be-Dazzler. And I had a lot of patches, shiny ones from M&J Trimming. So I wreaked havoc on some old denim. And I did what any girl would do; I did it all over again

[Verse 1]
I usually avoid any type of confrontation, conversation, in moderation
Lips sealed but my fingers are flying
And as the hours pass, they grow more impatient
My phone is magnetic, especially when I'm sauced up
And I admit that I'm ashamed
But there's Melissa, Theresa and Emily what a toss up
But that's the best part of the game
And I'm really an anonymous, aspiring alcoholic
Drowning the days pain in hops, barley and grain
Thinking of ways to convince one to join me
In the company of low-lives, sort doing the same
So I start texting, I keep texting, I can't stop, it's my obsession
It's like fish and my words are like lures
If they bought the bait cool, if not call it a night

[Hook]
We can't, more like we should have and I know
And I try, to be a good boy but it's hard
I start texting, I keep texting, I can't stop, it's my obsession

[Verse 2]
Now ask yourself this, is love a tender thing
Too rough, too rude, too boisterous?
Well, I'll tell you what man
I had it once and it was fun but not enough
'Tis torture and not mercy
Heaven is where my phone lives
In my pocket, so cozy oh what a joy replies give
See, Melissa's babysitting and Theresa's working late
But Emily's on her way to East 11th on the train
And that's when I remember Patty from West Philly
She said, I'm in your area, three minutes away
So I stop texting, no more texting, yeah, right, it's my obsession
It's like fish and my words are like lures
If they bought the bait cool, if not call it a night

[Hook]
We can't, more like we should have and I know
And I try, to be a good boy but it's hard
I start texting, I keep texting, I can't stop, it's my obsession

[Verse 3:]
I know you think I'm wreckless, move so fast (slow down)
I think I love him so I told him but in a text message (uh-huh)
He wrote back, "Me too.. I was just sitting here thinking bout you"
I know I want him but I can't and I shouldn't
Tried to put my phone down, damn! But I couldn't
Stayed on the phone with him all night long
Txt Message when I'm gone

[Hook]
We can't, more like we should have and I know
And I try, to be a good boy but it's hard
I start texting, I keep texting, I can't stop, it's my obsession

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Now I'm just sittin' here at this red light
With my emergency brake on
The wheels spinnin', whip lookin' like it got new skates on
I'm talking 9.8 seconds boy, this ain't gonna take long
Then I hop out at the finish line like, "is this what you waitin' on?"
I'll tell you what, homie, you ain't gotta wait long
All I'm thinkin' bout this is trophy I'mma take home
Give 'em somethin' they can hate on
Confetti all over the place, girls poppin' out that cake holmes
And my skin tone should be
The only thing you askin' me about race holmes
Yea, I'ma tell you what you not gonna do
Cause if the wing pop out the back of that Ferrari
Then the Bugatti got one too
I'm tryna throw these great balls of fire
I'm talking woo-bop-a-lop-bam-boom
Jesus Christ, feel like I got two Bibles out, zoom-zoom
And I'm like

[Hook: T-Pain]
Hold up, yeah, you gotta let me through
Yea, you gotta let me through
And I stay ridin', you gotta let me through
And my niggas slidin', so you gotta let them too
You gotta let me through
You gotta let me through
Cause I stay ridin', you gotta let me through
And my niggas slidin', so you gotta let them too

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I got too much rubber to burn, fire hazard
Lil Tune, the tycoon
Cash Money mascot, it's hot under this costume
Got pedals I've never stepped on
Buttons I've never pressed on
Backseats I've never effed on
Police, still get the F bomb
I still ride with my niggas, money don't change a gangster
And when I'm asked to pull a few strings
I pull 'em until they untangle
Watch me donuts as she throw up like hell yeah
More money, more problems, I'm surprised I still have black hair
I feel like racing, racing, who racing?
Don't give up the location
And if we bet, I win then hit the strip club
And go throw at them pole babies
Riding so fast with the top down
The wind sound like a standing ovation
Tunechi, fast and furious, I like my bitch fast and flirtatious

[Hook: T-Pain]
Hold up, yeah, you gotta let me through
Yea, you gotta let me through
And I stay ridin', you gotta let me through
And my niggas slidin', so you gotta let them too
You gotta let me through
You gotta let me through
Cause I stay ridin', you gotta let me through
And my niggas slidin', so you gotta let them too

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
No I don't know why y'all niggas think
I been slackin' like I ain't been on my shit
Until I pass by in that fast ride and now your bitch is on my dick
I'm talkin' bout, slidin', back and forth up in your tub
I fuck that shit on that video, now that video is on Pornhub
I say ridin' through FSU in that fam, fam
I've been packin' stacks
And now we back to back on them can ams
Lam-borghini paint
I remain to reign over these lame-ass rap niggas
Matter fact, niggas packed in the back
Of the 'Lac with a knapsack full of Macs and snacks
For the attack, you niggas ain't got time to react
Nappy boy in this bitch bring the calvary back
Teddy Pain motherfucker, I don't slack on the track
Red dot to the dome, put a gap in your hat
Chevy leanin' like a bitch, boy you have to relax
Double sided like a battlin' axe
You gettin' mad cause your rappin' is wack
And all the shit that you been doin' recently
My niggas laughin' at that

[Hook: T-Pain]
Hold up, yeah, you gotta let me through
Yea, you gotta let me through
And I stay ridin', you gotta let me through
And my niggas slidin', so you gotta let them too
You gotta let me through
You gotta let me through
Cause I stay ridin', you gotta let me through
And my niggas slidin', so you gotta let them too

[Verse 1]
K.Dot, you know that he's hot
I can do rhythm, hip hop, I can do pop
We talkin' 'bout the black, we talking 'bout the brown
We talkin' 'bout the white, it don't care who you around
It's all about the positivity when you with energy
If you knew me, then you know that God had witnessed me
If you see me then you know you can't intimidate me or be me
You can see we go for the energy
(K104)
K104
Best hip hop and R&B, I be up in your store
You know I'm rocking out, I got my people around me
We in the building and you know definitely you can't down me
And if the children...
(Dede)
And if the Dede, she called me cute
I walked in the building, I said yo, she got on boots
She got on earrings, maybe baby girl got on hoops
She got that long, brown hair, it's wrapped, yeah, she cute

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
He say I'm killing this beat, K.Dot he never been weak
You know I got them flows and plus I've always been cheap
And they talk 'bout strip clubs, I talk 'bout ladies and hugs
We talking 'bout more abuse, we talking 'bout these drugs
We talking 'bout my lady to the right, she real fly
Say your name again, girl, don't be shy
(Lady Jade)
Lady Jade, she aways talkin' 'bout gettin' paid
And the haters they in our way and they getting sprayed
Cause the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
They're always gonna play, play, play, play, play
No matter what they say, say, say, say, say
We're getting paid, boss, paid, boss
What's up?

[Verse]
Open up the case on 'em
Set his own pace, peeped the rats, wasn't racing with 'em
Made it out the maze, haze with the stanky odor
Simmer down my brain when I can't control it
Nigga, where your chips? You should bet 'em on him
Call the vet he barking, hear him and the mess he started
Nigga, they keep a eye on me, I am not a child artist
I raised the bar and hit a chin-up for a while on it
Life a long ride, my niggas up for it
My bitches down for me cause I stay a buck-fifty
Angel City drought time, why the fuck I'm up fifty
Playing like I'm down five? They can't really fuck with me
Let a nigga sizzle in the pan if he wanna
Los Angeles area annual summer, we burning under it
Learned from taking chances and fumbling
Nigga I was taught to take your rations and guzzle 'em, bitch
You gotta keep 'em separated
You like the latest fashions
You like to keep 'em clean?
Well take a trip every week to the laundromat
And throw a load in the washing machine
But if you don't wanna ruin your clothes
You gotta sort them out first, as everyone knows
Remember bright colors and the others don't mix
Before you wash 'em up! wash 'em up! wash 'em up! wash 'em up!

HEY!
Are your undies turning pink?
Take 'em out!
You gotta keep 'em separated
HEY!
Are your cottons gonna shrink?
Sort 'em out!
You gotta keep 'em separated

HEY!
Then when it's time
You can stick 'em in the dryer, you can hang 'em on the line
HEY!
Its Laundry Day!
When the desert sun has passed horizon's final light
And darkness takes it's place...
We will pause to take our rest
Sharing songs of love
Tales of tragedy

The souls of heaven
Are stars at night
They will guide us on our way
Until we meet again
Another day
When a poet sings the song and all are hypnotised
Enchanted by the sound...
We will mark the time as one
Tandem in the sun
The rhythm of a hymn

The souls of heaven
Are stars at night
They will guide us on our way
Until we meet again
Another day
When the dawn has come
Sing the song
All day long
We will move as one
Bear the load
On the road

The souls of heaven
Turn to stars
Every single night
All across the sky...
They shine
New to the site if any of ya'll taylors wanna link up hmu ! lookin to make friends and hopefully can start dropping shit on sc

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, well
It's the cynical, comin' to your digital mind
I put my dick inside some kitten when I finish a rhyme
Need another whip, it's my ambition to ride
I'm drinkin' liquor and rackin' up DWI's
It's the, the uncomparable, who do you compare me to?
The candy paint cherry and the punch is raspberry blue
I rap circles 'round y'all this shit is spherical, hysterical
Flow creatin' burial scenes, I'm dyin'
On my back though I carry the team
And every time we out in public, shit we very obscene, yeah
Larry Fish, known to fuck a fat bitch or two
Girl me and you could be somethin', we apples and juice
I'm way too advanced for y'all
Two pack a-day smoker, get my cancer on
Can't go wrong, always been the man, no flaws
Fuck this rap shit, I'm at the mall tryin' to get a job
But my application's sittin' at the bottom of the pile
Cause the manager tell me I'm the father to her child
It's America, home of hamburgers and some old shit
Don't play me, I ain't no bitch
The flow sick, polio
No limit, word to Master P you Lil' Romeo

[Interlude: Domo Genesis]
I am I got this
Trust me dude, trust me dude

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
Say goodnight to the bad guy, I spit the raps like I'm baptized
I'm antsy cause I lasted where they blast 9’s
No slackin', never have time
I'm wild unless somebody show me cash time
Press airline, fuckin' hand-sign, get 'em stuck up like a tampon
Move bitch, you see me gettin' over, kill it til I get some closure
Kid I been overrun it plenty, now it's tippin' over
Shawty wanna ride, I give her different strokes she love me
Never listen, on my pimpin', too traditional
Ill but on a different note, diggin' in this lane
Leave 'em pigeon hoed (toed)
I'm down to ride, even though I'm higher than the ceiling, go
Everybody hated out the gates now they trainy hoppin'
Everything so rock solid, Dwayne Johnson
Dom's on that real deal thrill land, manila
Real nigga, never timid, still drifting in his feelings, fuck
Sticking him in submissions, never plot on giving up
Shitting on you gimmicks, that's some shitty luck, sick a duck

[Outro]
Yeah that shit sweet
Yeah I'm feeling like dude, I can do anything
Like, I just took the limitless pill or something

[Verse]
Whoever thought a young'un' from a city full of rattlesnakes
Was ever gon' make it out the grass patch
Seven heels had me looking for a better deal
A hood nigga; I couldn't count on the NASDAQ
Coming home from school, I had tears in my eyes
They was picking on me and wouldn't give me my hat back
Now, I got enough hats to give away
It's better days, I refuse to have flashbacks
Nobody thought I knew what I was doing
Nobody believed, so nobody would walk me through it
But nobody achieved what I achieved
If only somebody could have just seen what I seen
Said they praying for me, don't we all got needs?
'Til I walk in the room, and they all just freeze
And they all look relieved, like, "Shit
If Faheem made it, now, we all got cheese"
Nah, homie, that ain't the way it work
Especially if you ain't even put in a day of work
Now, they going crazy 'cause I made it first
See, homie, I just made it work
It's a cold world, ask my old girl
She feel my pain, and I ain't even tryin' to make it hurt
And my daddy proud of me
But he got too much pride to say it out loud for me
Got that keyboard off the road, brought in the house for me
He coming to my shows, hanging in the crowd for me
Man, I still love my niggas
The only thing that I ask is that they hold it down for me
I still rep the 850, yeah
I got it tatted on my arm, it ain't goin' nowhere
But motherfuckers will say that you changed
And they the ones that wouldn't last a day in this game
Don't get me wrong, I ain't saying I stayed the same
But I guarantee that I will never succumb to the fame
That's some bullshit, and y'all know that ain't me
But I'd rather grow up than to stay eighteen
Life goes on and hopefully only great things
Traveling the world and seeing shit that I ain't seen
Then, one day, I look at my reflection
And realize how I been actin' and how I been dressing
I realize I can make an impression
But good Lord, this is fuckin' depressin'
And good Lord, I got some fuckin' questions
I think it's time for some motherfucking confessions
Wake up call, wake up call
My answer to every question was "Fuck y'all"
All I need is this 9-11 to fuck broads
I just need to find a seven with enough flaws
My last album ain't do numbers like I wanted to
But that was God tryna ask me what I'm gonna do
He said "I hate to put obstacles right in front of you
But you gotta learn to get out of what you're goin' through"
Hurdles got jumped, mountains got climbed
Til' Molly came and put a fuckin' wall up in my mind
Now I'm in the crib trippin', complainin' and bitchin'
That liqour go to hittin', I'm in here reminiscing
How many niggas told me I was gonna fail?
'Cause I got a list of niggas that can go to Hell
They feel like I owe 'em something 'cause they know me well
Calling me a sellout cause I won't come back and smoke a L
The same nigga that told me I had a hit
Charged me $300 to put it up in his mix
Now suicide lookin' better than hittin' the lick
'Cause the whole time they knew that I was livin' out my whip
But now I see 'em, and I can't even take iit
Cause he walk up to me and say:
"Boy, I knew you was gon' make it"
And like, "Motherfucker, do you not just recall?
I needed help, and you just left me sittin' on my balls"
That just wasn't the right life
So I told him bullshit, to have a nice life
And all them girls yellin' at me from in front of the moon
Like nigga, how you just gonna go and get a white wife?
Fuck you bitches, I did what I did
Now, I'm running round my mansion doing shit with my kids
But now, maybe my life is too sweet
Like I woke up in that Bugatti and went right back to sleep
Deep, I was dreaming, y'all niggas was scheming
Like crabs up in the bucket, but y'all just got defeated
And all these bitches, all just want my semen
The star collecting checks and ball up in the season
But ain't nobody give a fuck when ain't nobody give a fuck
Now, they got they hand out, asking me to give it up
And every time they ask me for something
They say, "Now, you know that I ain't never asked you for nothin'"
I got loss, I got loss
Credit cards got swiped, money got tossed
Hundred after hundred, dollar after dollar
Drinking every kind of liquor, then that Molly got swallowed
I know I fucked up 'cause I'm a grown man
So now, I'm thinking like my old man
He said "You wanna make God laugh?
Then look up in the sky and try and come up with your own plan"
Now, I see my niggas just want me to win
But I won't have 'em if I keep disrespecting my friends
They been through it, say they know the feel
So all I need is a trip up to Stoicville

[Verse 1]
Yeah, let the smoke simmer live
From a spot only disclosed for winners
My heart is cold as winter
I draw this image with the artiste of the soulful sinner
But only God can judge my partners and my co-defendants
Single parent home, half my life my pops incarcerated
I know that life can be a bitch there ain't no harsher statement
But all the long time made the God as hard as pavements
Stand or fall I'm ready for the brawl involving large arrangements
Man I planned this shit in my youth
It's concentrated energy in all the shit that I do
That's all I have I take my past and end up spitting the truth
But they be hating when I shine cause they visions is booth
Niggas playin', don't take in any shit that they sayin'
It's entertainment, just put 'em in the steps that I taken
I bet they vanquish, hard knock life don't get the best of him
Hard knock life don't let the devil in
Thought you could see me? Quit the mescaline
I'm balling till the blessings end
Regardless who the hardest I'm stepping in, next to win

[Hook]
Said I'm knocking hard, don't let the devil in
But regardless bitch I'm stepping in
It's the hard knock life won't get the best of him
I'm balling till the blessings end

[Outro]
Boy just be yourself, if people don't like you if you're being yourself FUCK 'EM!
Let me tell you something, I used to go out with a girl 'bout your age, I tried to please her pappy all the time went out my way to please her pappy I come here one day I said: "nice weather we're having" say "you can't say that, you can't say that it might rain". I said: "nice tie you got on" say "you can't say that, why you tryna choke me with it". Point I'm tryna tell you son, is be yourself, people don't like you when you're being yourself fuck 'em! Fuck 'em up against the wall! With handcuffs on and crazy glue on their lips. That's all you do
*Hmm, words to live by.*
Live by them son
*Okay um, I'm gonna go to the club now uncle Fester and just go.*
You go enjoy yourself boy

[Intro]
I'm a black man and I don't know how to sing and I don't know how to dance and I don't know how to preach to no congregation. I'm too small to be a football hero. And I'm too ugly to be elected mayor. But I watch TV and I see all them people and all them fine homes they live in and all them nice cars they drive. And I get all full of ambition. Now you tell me what I'm supposed to do with all this ambition I got

[Verse: Domo Genesis]
I know this feeling like my right hand
A nigga claimed he never changed is not a wise man
Bro, there's levels to this life, gotta devise the right plan
You never never buy greatness, still we hoping the price scan
Its now the crews, you gotta do your homework
You never do right without doing wrong first
Learn from your moves that don't work
Even with trouble feel I'm better off
I'm just saying
How you planning on finding yourself if you was never lost?
Whatever cost, I pay it, all the scars I walk away with
Given sparks of faith in the darkest places I hardly made it out of
Though I'm grateful to be the outcome
Lost so many you around 'em
Guess my dreams are screaming loud
And they got lost in the volume
I'm still rolling it up with Eazy even knowing they doubt him
It's just something about him
You lust to roll these dice on the floor
Intuition don't think twice anymore
Like what is life anymore?
I knew that this was real when we had dinner with Hov
See niggas where I'm from don't even get a glimpse to be, yo
Just a young nigga sick of having to deal what he's told
Everyone that wasn't down just gotta picture me rolling
I'm drawing out of line, running out of time
Just tryna smoke these voices out a cloudy mind
Speak the real when all these connoisseur crowd behind
That nostalgic feeling sending chillings down their spine
Yeah, like this is just how we remembered it
Claimed the shit over and over and now I'm living it
If I cried a river, man, my death would be continuous
But I just roll the pain and burn it down for the remembrance of
When I was doing this to get that feeling I love
Writing while we selling innocence from my lungs

[?] when I'm old, but I'mma live since I'm so young
Trying to give them something to remember me from

[Hook: Tay Walker]
Oh, can't somebody tell me where to go?
Cause I can barely tell my right from wrong
And lately I've been feeling kind of lost
But I'll find a way, just follow me
Just follow me

[Interlude]
Man, it has been a while, hasn't it? Y'all reached the end of Under The Influence 2. And it's just a hard feeling leaving y'all, you know what I'm saying? Y'all been here to support me, listened to what I had to say, and it's all just coming to an end now, you know what I'm saying? But if you ever feel like life is getting the best of you. You down in a dump so you need a twist to turn around. You sobering up. Let's roll up. Start this from number 1. You know what I'm saying? That's what I'm here for, that's what I do for my peeps. I'm the people's champ. Domo Genesis. And this was Under The Influence 2. I just wanna give a shout out to my mom. My nana and papa. Cause you know they held your boy down. The Clancy's, you know what I'm saying? Everybody in the group. All my niggas from Inglewood

[Sample]
Forever mine, ooh, you're one of a kind, ooh
Oh baby, I got what you want, you got what I need
Oh, we were made, made for each other

[Interlude]
I'm about to get out of here, peace

[Sample]
Forever mine, all because you're my kind
Oh baby, I got what you want, you got what I want
We were made for each other
Oh baby, you are that someone I been hoping, I been looking

[Intro]
Ay let the, let the beat play Imma feel it more you feel me, Imma feel my swag a little more
You know what I'm sayin'
Yeah you know what I'm sayin'
Ratchets they get the penis
Ratchets get the penis

[Hook]
Oooh I get money getting money for sho'
I'm getting money for sho'
And I get high
I smoke weed and get high for the low
I get high for the low
Tell a bitch word
Hell no it ain't no love for a ho
It ain't no love for a ho
Tryna get by
On my grind bitch you already know
Bitch you already know

[Verse 1]
Respect this greatness when you see it
Bitches have it and believe it
A bashful bastard passion's for giving these ratchets penis
It's a stroke of genius
Money, nothing can come between it
And we never lenient
Swear this hustle was so convenient, pimp
How dare you pussies test the odds
First one up is next to die let me testify, I feel electrified
Man I never learn cause in a loss is where the lessons lie
Flawless how I bless 'em you ain't get the steps to mess with Gods
Peasants, we on a bubble like effervescence
Everything I got is just a product of raw finess
And I manage fam
Me and money going hand in hand
Winners circle snapping pictures for the camera man
*Camera clicking sounds*
"Pose for the camera"
"Doms! Doms!"
"Doms look!"

[Verse 2]
Get off my nuts and let me breath for a second
Young and gifted, thought this was Christmas eve for a second
Just had a plate already fiending for seconds
On the low like I was sneaking a weapon
I only speed to regression, I'm vexed
Jackie Joyner used the burners when chasing a check
Niggas chasing the couchie retracing my steps
Bitch you playing to lose cause you playing the best
Talking 'bout some bending the rules bitch I'm breaking the necks
Spit it out like emphysema
I got a strict demeanor fire my desire like Rick and Teena
Magic in a dream, since a teen I'm like that witch Sabrina
I'm a legend in these Bapes, Stan Smith Adidas
Who you barking at
I'm a new era you a starter cap
Fitted for the ride nobody got your back
We running up the money
Word to my nigga Josh Peas ain't nothing funny

And I do my thang, yeah
And I do my thang
All niggas is bitches
And I do my thang
And I, and I, nigga and if I had to freestyle
You would have to pay me cause it ain't free now
Cause I'm a, nigga you gotta pay me
Or my publishing
Cause I need that money to live
Nigga gotta pay bills
Lights and gas and water
I need all of that, I need all of that
I got a baby momma and some kids and they need all the money so I gotta rap
And you gotta buy it
And you gotta like it
I got white girls just suckin' on my privates
And I'm violent
God damn what's wrong with Dom's mind
I'm insane, I'll hit a bitch in a spine nigga
And I climb up the tree like a monkey
Nigga and the swag hella funky
Your bitch got the dumpy
She look like she got the mumps, B
And I come through in a Humvee
With dumb sneaks
I'm outta here

[Verse 3: Hodgy Beats]
They don't show a nigga love they saying his rhymes sinister
Administer the signs of diminishing prime ministers
I sit in the studio for weeks and cop literature
Snortin' miniature lines of ideal scripture
Yeah, I write it all in my will
Write it 'till its written my passenger rights like a bill
I'm in charge like a rhino in a harness
A gladiator in a gauntlet
Kill every contestant that wanna contest
I don't strip that bitch naked she chose to undress
Once fixated on hatred I've come to confess
Now we fixated on greatness and bundles of checks
The young man's rumbling next
Fight trials 'till he's humbled at rest
I'm out fuckin' with your mumbling bitch
It was a beat now it's a run over nest
Take a hit and know the blunt smoke is hexed

[Hook]

[Interlude: Left Brain]
Oh yeah, this is the one right here. Matter of fact, this the two. It's Under The Influence once again. We riding, we smoking up. What's good? Fuck with us. Under The Influence 2. Or should I say.. uh.. should I say dos? For the fly Spanish mamis out there. Under The Influence once again. Listen to this shit right now, roll up something. A lil' something something roll up.

Riding in the wood. Baby, what's good? Throw it up, Under The Influence, roll it up. Wolf Gang, nigga, MellowHigh in this bitch. You already know who this is talking.

Get your money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money

[Interlude: L-Boy]
And just like that we back up in this motherfucker. I know y'all niggas didn't think it would be Under The Influence 2 without me. Your boy motherfucking L-Boy on this shit. Cause I'm back to grace this motherfucking track, nigga. I've been hearing niggas saying that "oh, L-Boy ain't that high. That boy don't smoke crack no more, that nigga washed up, he went to rehab." I'm letting you niggas know right now I'm deading all the rumors. I stay higher than any motherfucking nigga you ever met in your life. I've been high for like 7 days straight now, nigga. I haven't seen my eyes, nigga. I'm too high, nigga. You understand what I'm saying? Cause I don't, nigga. I don't even speak English no more, motherfucker, that's how high I am, nigga. You feel me? No, nigga, you don't feel me, shut the fuck up and listen to me, nigga. Cause I'm about to lay this motherfucking smooth shit down, nigga. Cause we back up in this bitch, motherfucker. That's all I got to say. Alright, I'm out, I'm out of here. Cut me off, nigga. Why is this still going? Just cut the motherfucking track. Nigga, cut the got damn track off, nigga. You hear me? Fuck, I gotta do everything myself

[Verse 1]
Tell them niggas clear the lane, we on the way up
Tired of waiting, telling them pussy niggas stay up
Pressure, I'm putting, pushing the ball til they pay up
Killing niggas easy, man, this shit is like a lay up
And I'm chilling in my lair
See me marijuana pulling bitches by the hair
Cause they know a nigga real, man, this shit ain't even fair
Like creative player, swagger make your bitch go "woooo", Ric Flair
In the back of my grizzly, you silly niggas, we run shit
Drunk, hella pissy, my niggas ready to funk shit
Talking out your neck, make a nigga wanna slump shit
When a nigga say he real gotta deal with repercussion, man
Chilling in the venue with some blunts in hand
Young nigga getting baked like the muffin man
Talking money, no other discussion, fan
Winning, man, you niggas gotta trust the plan

[Hook]
I ain't even gon' front, I ain't even gon' front
I ain't even gon', I ain't even gon' lie
I get what I want and everything I want
Still hella money on my mind, hella money on my mind
Real niggas gon' love, real niggas gon' love
Niggas gon' ride, niggas gon ride
You can play if you want, play if you want
Young nigga getting high, nigga getting high

[Verse 2]
Nigga, you know me
Chilling like a villain feeling too OG
I'm on a spree killing the trend of you niggas gimmicks
With an end to all this bickering, niggas is feminine
Pappy did teach me all the rhythms to be a gentleman
I hit the ground running, no 

[?] to what I'm entering
I'm real, repping what I got here
Watching it all grow from the views of my lounge chair
Know they wanna see a nigga lose, but I do not care
Never looking back, they owe me for what I'm coming for
Got my heart racing, that's why I'm smoking a ton of dro
I'm gunning, my niggas who switching up and other rose
I was still tryna figure out where the money go
I'mma find my way, I promise you that
Youngin with ambition, pimping, I thought you knew that
Stunting on them suckers, them fuckers like where they do that
About to blow up so pussy nigga just move back

[Outro]
Get out the way, move bitch, get out the way
Bitch, move, bitch, get out the way
Move, bitch, get out the way
Move, bitch, get out the way
Move, bitch, get out the way
Bitch, biatch
(Yea I'm right here dog) Where my dogs at
(We right here dog) Where my dogs at
(I'm right here dog)

What must I go through to show you shit is real
And I ain't really never gave a fuck how niggas feel
Rob then I steal, not cause I want to cause I have to
And don't make me show you with the Magnum
If you don't know by now then you slippin
I'm on some bullshit thats got me jackin, niggas flippin
I got my man and them stay pretty like I'ma stay shitty
Crimey it's all for the money is you wit me
Hit the bitches, went out I could make the crime
And when it's on we transform like Optimus Prime
I'll form the head, roll out let's make it happen
If we ain't gonna get it wit them we'll take the cap down
Bust it off, gust it off on the softest niggas
Money with the biggest mouth, yo let's rob this nigga
A novice nigga never made a sound
Breath too fuckin hard like you gettin bust down
Yo, yo ya niggas wanna be killers (get at me dog)
Ya niggas wanna feel us (get at me dog)
Ya niggas want the real (Get at me dog)

Rrrrrr arf arf what the deal

Y'all niggas fucking with the L.O.X
Your stuck on a rock
Got that Alcatraz flow
You just don't know
Lifetime kid caged in blazin'
Any type of rapper or federal agent
Paniro the made man, blade man
Stand up type of guy, your living a lie
Niggas wanna be pretty and fly but kiddies will die
The dogs run the city, bet fifty on mine
Two grams for you to sniff, how silly am I
Got a lot of jokes don't, kill yo ass won't I
Maybe not if the spot is filled up with po 9
Many niggas get it confused, blame the rules
Only ask the how's not the who's
Better off busting your tool, then we might get the crew
But as far as rap goes, you a motherfucking fool
If you don't want chips, you should have stayed in school
You and 8-ball nigga, you wanna play pool
I'll put you in the side pocket, look at the size of my rocket
Styles don't lie, cop the work then clock it
Boxes full of boots, jeans, suits and watches
Niggas don't pump if they can't make a profit
Stop it, before we pull it back then cop it
Vacant lot niggas come through then we
Yeah, what? what? what?

[Produced by SAP]

[Verse 1]
I dare you niggas, try to sleep through this
This shit is so raw, I might not have my engine EQ it
I pen the poison and these lethals might just bleed through it
Like Drumline when Nick couldn't read the sheet music
Talent unadulterated, the face of danger get exfoliated
I'm super thuggin', word to Noreaga
Liver than the days my uncle used to let me sport his pager
I dream of faster lives and waking with enormous paper
It's just the days of our lives, hate fueling fam
I'm feeling full, faith in my pride
Long race, slow pace, I'm cool, patient with time
Stay graceful, although when I'm embracing my high
Ya'll don't relate to my mind, I can't call it fam
All you niggas soft,  I ain't ballin' with no Juwanna Mann
Hardest in the paint, what I'm drawing is such a flawless plan
Wrote me in my pain when I'm talking, I got my heart in hand
Rain falling, man

[Hook]
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
And even though things seem strange
I only go outside in the rain
Where I stole, I fueled and I gained
I wanna play in the rain, in the rain
And even though things seem strange
I only go outside in the rain
Where I stole, I fueled and I gained
I wanna play in the rain, in the rain

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
I ain't skipping the beat until my mission complete
Why every rapper sounding like a poor rendition to me?
Sometimes I think like, "Do you really want the crown nigga?"
I had to separate, don't like being around niggas, except my niggas I went to New York, was on TV for like 5 minutes
It's my time, listen, I got prime vision, seeing shit clear now
Plan this year and the next year out
I said, fuck the industry, I'm 'bout loyalty
Rap like Jesus anointed me, second, I see no point to be
Praying for direction, I guess this is where he pointing me
So I'mma run the game for the next ten summers
We ain't ever had nothing, had to get it by ourselves
Was a dream just for me to have my CD on the shelves
Especially without a deal, especially without your cosign
Knowing in my head like, I'mma make it the whole time
Just to believe and speak my dreams into reality
The tale of two cities, can you see the dualities?
The parallel lines of living my rhymes?
The qualities that I possess, it's just a matter of time

[Hook]
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
And even though things seem strange
I only go outside in the rain
Where I stole, I fueled and I gained
I wanna play in the rain, in the rain
And even though things seem strange
I only go outside in the rain
Where I stole, I fueled and I gained
I wanna play in the rain, in the rain
This is it right here, what? (Ruff Ryders!)

What? Yo, yo, yo, yo, ayo
If gon' sleep on somethin, might as well be a bed
And if you gon' crack a (huh?), might as well be a head
Cause if you targettin the L.O.X. You might as as well target a box
That you gon' sleep in for years, all covered wit rocks
Cause I think not, I pop shots, I double what y'all got
Ya hotshots ain't got blocks, ?llabuta? muchacha
From the days in school, now a mother... rule
And I could drop my chain in court, yeah, keeps ya cool
That's how ice be, I'm priceless, the iciest
And I dont gotta wear fatigues to blow out your chest
My bullets thump when I'm laced in some fly shit, punk
The baby nine be on the daily, ain't no poppin a trunk
But if I pop the trunk, its to hand you a rag
So you can wipe down the windows on the side of my Jag
Must I brag? My ... paid for, yours tagged
And every sheek you grabbed
Sheek bend em back
Ayo I hope you ain't tongue-kissin your spouse
Cause I be makin love in her in the mouth
Type of nigga buck at your house
Too slick, means she be suckin my dick
And before you know it, I'ma have her stuffin my bricks
Jada, if I kiss you now, you'll die later
I been nice since people was watchin movies on Beta
Ready to clap, everybody givin me gats
Cause believe it or not, we be the ones settin the traps
You listen to y'all hits, then listen to our hits
Ain't nuttin y'all cowards could do but gossip
That's the reason now y'all playas ain't got chips
Cause everytime I turn around y'all on the L.O.X. dick
Niggas thats narrow, I just smack em wit the barrel
Give it to em at the light, like Kane's cousin Abel

I be the D-R, A-G, dash O-N, slash often Comma, burnin ... often
They call me Drag-On, I'm hot scorchin
Keep the block roastin Light a dutch wit the flames comin, toastin
In my eyes you could see what summer's holdin
Realizin, every guy I'll fry or dead rowdy
I burn to a degree of 130, and my gun dirty
Cause it got one bury, so you better run, hurry Or catch one early
You wrong, tryin to touch me, what type of shit you on?
You better through your boots on and your unflammable suits on
Cause I'm comin through wit a Yukon Black tinted wit gats in it
Catch you while you smokin, send your casket, throw the sack in it
But only half of it, cause y'all like half-ass dude
And we are one whole, and y'all niggas is one slash two
My gun blast you, tryna out the flames, what're you, firemen?
You'll catch a hell of a Backdraft cause my fire retirin, aight then
Its my, survival instinct that keeps my head above the water
Everyday I show another how a lover slaughter
Flood your daughter, full of more holes than spurges
Taxin businessmen for stocks over lunches
Wit these, I shoot the breeze, and extort
Enough keys from the Cuban, to build a f... fort
Caught up in somethin that I can't control
Tryna get a hold of a bankroll, let's role
Catch bodies like a cold, and I stay slick so face it
Make me chase it, I take your life and erase it

Clue!!

Wasted, in the fuckin streets cause it ain't worth shit
The undertaker take your ass unbder the earth quick
I Love money, but the scrambles hot
So i snatch up my man and the gamblin spot
Twenty grand is got, when niggas shot, one nigga less
What used to be his chest is now a mess under his f... vest
Uh, uh, uh
Niggas getting trampled on, what's all the fuss about?
Sucking my dick so hard, I'm busting in they mouth
And then I snuff em out, four to the mid', fuck what I did
With no regard for a bid, ripped you up, while you wit your kid
Slid into the shadows, cause I'm dark like that
I bark like that, jet black, but I spark like that
Where are they at, when I get thirsty, shit
Ain't a nigga strong enough to stand the worst it gets
Bits, and pieces are all that's that left
Niggas so scared to death, they hold they motherfucking breath
Til I pass, cause they asked/ass, and I smelled 'em
The s-p-e-l-l-e-d t-h-e-m, I spelled em
To make me have to swell one, eye up, lump up one head
Catch a body with the shotty, pump up one dead
Red alert, niggas is about to get hurt, do work
To skirts, like a jag on the merk, arf
Night time is the right time for creeping
Vandalize your crib, rape your wife while she's sleeping
I been off the deep end, since I was semen
That's why now, I'm such a motherfucking demon!
Screaming, my bloody head off, shit on my mind I gotsta get off
Can't even hold a joint, lest I let off
A couple of rounds, from the big three pound, seven
That's about eleven hundred as of now
How-can-one-man-kill-so-many-and
The-sin-be-plenty-before-the-age-of-20 *sing-song like nice and smooth*
Life ain't worth a penny in, my book faggot
That's why I took faggot shit, I'm a crook faggot
Fat loops leather jackets, I bag it, along with
The jewels smacking tools out the hands of fools
On the strength that they don't know what they holding
Niggas caught me tail end cause the weight that I be sewing
Shit up cause I get up, off my ass and skate
Making more moves than u-haul, from state to state
I speak the great, and if a nigga tells you different
You turn around you ask the nigga, "the fuck is you be sniffing?
Cause when it come to riffing, I am the riff raffin
Gots to say nutting, niggas know they get had
Motherfucker, Funk Flex, Vol. 3, The Final Chapter
Ruff Ryders, Irv Gotti, Def Jam..
Right here, where my dogs at?
Got them all for you baby I got them all

Ugh dmx

See what I'm able to see, (ugh) 'cause my vision is good
It's like I see through the eyes of a wise old man
So I chill, and when I can kill this guy's whole fam
Something better to be thought dumb and remain silent
Then to open your mouth and remove all doubt 'cause if it became violent
See I'm gonna give it to you straight, so you don't ask anymore
You don't really want what you asking me for
It's a war (ugh), when it's on it's on, when I'm long (what)
Till I'm gone and I ain't got long
But while I'm here, (ugh) y'all niggas gonna burn
Peep how I finished money (what) and y'all niggas gonna learn

And always keep enough dough to know I'm good for the day
Always walk my dogs off the leash and
Always get my thoughts off the streets and
Always will ever lend a hand then borrow
And always no matter what plan for tomorrow
I always pay my respects to the dead
I always take at least one blunt to the head
Now always know -- (cut off) is gonna end up getting fucked

Never try to knock off rock on the block that ain't yours
Never take a man's life 'cause you hate yours
Never become so involved with something that it blinds you
Never forget where you from someone will remind you
Never take for granted what's been given as a gift
And never sleep on a nigga unless that nigga stiff
Never turn your back on a nigga you don't trust
Never turn your gat on a nigga and don't bust
Never expect to get away with the same shit more than twice
Never forget you could get it too for a price
Never bring it to a nigga if you scared to die
Never gonna do it -- if you scared to try
Never gonna be another day it gets dark
Never get it -- here for the heart
Never say never, 'cause I never thought, this never thought never
Ever caught better, getting cheddar, with three letters

[Intro]

[Verse]
Uh, one shot, one ques
How you bitch niggas feel?
More soul than a lil' bit
Visions of it all, ain't no comfort in this lil' shit
You got it and I need it, consider this, I'm about to hit a lick
Switch, show these baby gill niggas who they dealing with
It's I, you geeks are just speaking of still images
You fear me in my physical form
I'm killin' anything you niggas picture me on
It's been a minute, penny-pinching, we eventually spawn
I was to get up, fill up
Machine gun raps for all my niggas rollin' with us
And whoever wanna oppose, consider them niggas hit up
For all the days with no pay, we still lit up
For the money, yeah I get a gut feeling like a sit up
Go and give up, you niggas pathetic
I had to scrimmage for the trenches
Never been so pathetic, this some shit, I regret it
But slow me down, never leaded
I'm still spitting this fire like I've been sipping unleaded
He too sick for the medics, I cut him deep like a open heart
More beast than the passengers in Noah ark
See me in the streets, be discrete or get broke apart
Man, it's a thin line, rest in peace to Owen Hart
Damn, don't need you tellin' me who I am
All that tellin', tellin', man I'm tallying up the grams
Smoking killer Cali, man, that package that's in demand
Spoke with Dom's on the work he makin' it crack with spoon
It's dope nigga, it's too dope nigga, there's no hope nigga
See I be riding through my old hood, same old attitude
Chillin with your girlfriend, why she always mad at you
She be like “blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah”
Only time that she quiet, when my thing is inside her
Don’t you know I’m a writer
Yeah, I sleep in her stomach
And I slip her a 50, just to keep her 100
Yeah, my swaggers so dummy
We so stupid, so silly
I watch them girls getting lower than a kick in the milli
Gambino, why you got a gold chain?
Cause girls only gonna see you when you stuntin, man
I’m coming back, swag on Rogaine
Girl let me see your two chains on it
So hood, man what you talking bout
Man, I’m watching Law and Order on my grandma’s couch
Eating Lucky Charms for dinner
Loser to a winner
Swag so Clippers
Me and Blake Griffin
Me and Blake Griffin
Why your goals dripping
You even seen ballers like us po’ pimping
Ha, we getting drunk like a Kennedy
Ha, we stay fly like the end of Grease
Yeah, I got O’s like CP3
Don’t worry, don’t worry, don’t you worry ’bout me
I’m only worried when that period’s on CPT
When that period’s on CPT

[Verse 1]
Down on the West Coast, they got a sayin'
"If you're not drinkin', then you're not playin'"
But you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
Down on the West Coast, I get this feeling like
It all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the music, you for the music
It's true, it's true

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I push it hard, you pull away, I'm feelin' hotter than fire
I'm feeling like there's no one else, brings me higher and higher
Te deseo, cariño, boy it's you I desire
Your love, your love, your love

[Chorus]
I can see my baby swingin'
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, Ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swayin'
He's crazy y Cubano como yo, my love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love (I'm in love, I'm in love)

[Verse 2]
Down on the West Coast, they got their icons
Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigons
But you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You pull me close, I push away... I'm feeling hot to the touch
You say you miss me and I wanna say I miss you so much
But something keeps me really quiet
I'm alive, I'm a lush
Hold me close you say, hush baby hush

[Chorus]
I can see my baby swingin'
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, Ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swayin'
He's crazy y Cubano como yo, my love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love

[Chorus]
I can see my baby swingin'
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, Ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swayin'
He's crazy y Cubano como yo, my love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love

[Outro]
I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love

[Intro: T.I. & Pharrell]
You was supposed to make it
You was supposed to make it
You was supposed to make it

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Tell me why it is now that we live only for the moment?
Erybody going deeper to the dark
Point of no return, following the evil
Running from the Lord, hatred in the heart
Off a nigga, poison a nigga
Used to play and trade toys with a nigga
Now you gotta go to war with a nigga
Just because you got more than a nigga
Motherfuckers kamikaze you
They rather die then see you live fly
Crabs in a barrel, in ghetto America
Man, we just lucky that we make it out
See so much potential, lost some reputation
You would think eventually we will get it
They say you got it, they don't even want it
It just hurt so much for them to see you with it
What I know 'bout Satan, he patiently wait
To rob and steal and kill off greatness in the making
What we put together never let 'em take it
Goddamn shawty you were 'pose to make it

[Hook: Pharrell]
You was supposed to make it
You was supposed to make it
You was supposed to make it
You was supposed to make it, huh

[Post-Hook: Pharrell]
Get your lighters up, lighters up
Get your lighters up, lighters up
Get your lighters up, lighters up
Get your lighters up, lighters up
You was supposed to make it
You was supposed to make it
Get your lighters up, lighters up
Get your lighters up, lighters up

[Verse 2: T.I.]
You know when I met you, sitting in the car
Buckhead in the mall, you was something special
He was just a young nigga, still he never got excited
It was hard to overwhelm a fat nigga
With a eye patch, swingin' hard
Reppin' role tide Alabama
You can tell he was kickin' too much flavor
On a country nigga, made 'em wanna kill him
Still to see him smiling shawty, he be chillin'
Nigga wish him dead, he ain't even feel it
At your video, I could feel the then
We was at the club, nigga couldn't get it in
They was stuck outside, start to look at you
And as you should, you looked like "fuck I 'posed to do?"
Asked you 'bout it then, said "ay brah you cool?"
You said "I ain't worry 'bout the lil dude"
Get they feelings hurt, got a attitude
They'll come around in a year or two"
Made you Hustle Gang, let you in the family
Said "I get you rich" you said "you won a Grammy"
Showed you how to mix the Actavis with candy
Doin' 160 with me, he ain't panic
Called me yesterday, I say "lil bro what's happening?
Working with Pharell, chillin' in Miami"
All you said was "Run it, book the flight I'm coming
'Fore I leave though, I gotta handle something""
I just said "okay", I hung up the phone
Couple hours later, damn my nigga gone

[

[Hook: Pharrell]
You was supposed to make it
You was supposed to make it
You was supposed to make it
You was supposed to make it, huh

[Bridge: Watch The Duck]
Devil's business, my brother gone
Supposed to be a living legend, hating nigga sent you home
But when we see that guy, we gon' treat him like the sky
On the 4th of July, and light him up

[Post-Hook: Pharrell]
Get your lighters up, lighters up
Get your lighters up, lighters up
Get your lighters up, lighters up
Get your lighters up, lighters up
You was supposed to make it
You was supposed to make it
Get your lighters up, lighters up
Get your lighters up, lighters up]
{Intro}

[Verse 1]
You can take me to the paradise
And then again you can be cold as ice
I'm over my head (over my head)
Oh, but it sure feels nice

[Verse 2]
You can take me anytime you like
I'll be around if you think you might
Love me, baby (over my head)
And hold me tight

[Bridge]
Your mood is like a circus wheel
You're changing all the time
Sometimes I can't help but feel
That I'm wasting all of my time

{Instrumental}

[Bridge]
Your mood is like a circus wheel
You're changing all the time
Sometimes I can't help but feel
That I'm wasting all of my time

[Verse 3]
I think, I'm looking on the dark side
But everyday you hurt my pride
I'm over my head (over my head)
Oh, but it sure feels nice

I'm over my head (over my head)
But it sure feels nice
I'm over my head (over my head)
But it sure feels nice

{Outro}

[Verse]
It's the subtle flex and know that imma creep right in
Screaming love, peace, and chicken grease, my deep fried friends
I'm on the street until I complete my ends
Can't sleep but fuck it, life is just a dream I'm in
And can't call it, man this weed is anabolic
Got me stalling trying to leave the crib
And I can't find my wallet, them just stoner nigga problems
Man, I manage, although at times outlandish fella
I'm cooling with a bitch from Spanish novellas
Twisting like a propeller
It's Dom's house from in the attic to down in the cellar
I'm brainstorming for the one's who ignored they umbrellas
Let the sky fall cause we already high above it
Ain't no need to check on how I am and how I've been blunted
And I ain't feeling nothing, your rap sheet is all cheats
All heat, blazing a trail, you niggas is frost feet
I'mma be the reason that you shook and you lost sleep
You baby ass niggas still locked in your carseat
I'm slept on like Mark Price
But I'm the voice of the kids like Nancy Cartwright
Come on dog, bark right
You need to get your heart right
Flow down, Act right, fresh beats and a mic
And I'm in that bitch all night
You love life? Well I'm fucking your girl
Before I'm done, I'll pull it out and just bust on the world
Money make the globe spin and I'm in lust with the twirl
This is a gem, my flow covered in pearls
Nigga who selling churros

[Outro]
Caus-, Cause them bitches is fire. (Churros is good). Yeah, and they go good with horchata. Horchata taste good with 'em?  Ya know I be on my Spanish shit. My Spanish bitch. Yeah (laughs)
I want some of yo Brown Sugar (x2)
This for the bitches right here. Here look:
I want some of yo Brown Sugar (x2)
Y'all like that? That's my lil Ray J
I want some of yo Brown Sugar
Yeah that was fire right there. I wanna hear that back, lemme hear that back. Let me here just the singing part,  that shit sound fire
I want some of yo Brown Sugar (x2)
I stretched that one out

[Skit]
Hey nigga, you did get some more Zig-Zags, didn't you?
Oh shit nigga i forgot
What the fuck you mean you forgot nigga
That’s the whole reason we went up in that motherfucker
My bad man damn i just want some rubbers man you know
I’m just tryna go to Monique’s house tonight
Whatever man, hey man, ya'll wanna hit this shit, homie? we cool
Fuck ya’ll Muslim’s or sumin
No we just don’t do that
Fuck it mo' for me
Tryna be generous to you little nigga’s and look how you do man i dont understand youngsters nowadays boy
A man pass that shit back this way
Fuck you boy you ain’t getting no zig zag
You ain’t getting no drig drag punk
That shit raw nigga, I should be a motherfucking rapper or summin
Yeah right, I'm harder than D.M.C
Man you crazy nigga
I’m more serious than a motherfucker, make a whole album about smoking weed
Nigga ain’t nobody ‘bout to buy no album about smoking weed
If i get some fresh ass beats like this right here boy, we’ll sell millions ,Weed is universal, you name me one great that don’t smoke bud
See, nigga i’ll sell millions i’m telling you, call that mo'fucker the weed album, errybody getting high
It's never been about fortune
Never been about the fame
Never been about money
People calling my name
Never cared for big houses
Never asked for fancy cars
Why do people treat me different?
Why do they call me a star?

They don't know;
Nothing in my life shines brighter than
Singing the song with people listening
I'm In love with my guitar
I know I'm different
Growing up all my friends went out to play
While I was in the house writing music all day
I'm In love with my guitar

So thanks to miss music
I didn't lose it
I didn't lose my mind
Cause I was with her all the time
And thanks to miss music
I made it trough it
They said I wouldn't go far
Still I'm in love with my guitar
With my guitar
With my guitar
Ah huh huh ah

They can take away the jewelry
Strip me of the fancy clothes
Put me in a dirty subway
With nowhere to go
Long as somebody hears me
Long as somebody cares
I will always sing my song
If somebody's there

They don't know;
Nothing in my life shines brighter than
Singing the song with people listening
I'm In love with my guitar
I know I'm different
Growing up all my friends went out to play
While I was in the house writing music all day
I'm In love with my guitar

Thanks to miss music
I didn't lose it
I didn't lose my mind
Cause I was with her all the time
And thanks to miss music
I made it trough it
They said I wouldn't go far
Still I'm in love with my guitar
With my guitar
With my guitar. ah huh arr
Yeah
Ah he hey

Help me face the man in the mirror
Help me see my life much clearer
Make me who I am today
So I have to say

Yeah

Thanks to miss music

Oh oh oh yeah
Oohhhhh

Thanks to miss music
Thanks to miss music
Oehhhhh
I didn't lose it
I didn't lose my mind
Cause I was with her all the time
And thanks to miss music
Thanks to miss music
I made it trough it. (ah hey)
They said I wouldn't go far
Still I'm in love with my guitar
With my guitar
My guitar
Yeah hey hieeee ohh my

[Verse 1]
Oh, Honeybear, Honeybear, Honeybear
Mascara, blood, ash and cum
On the Rorschach sheets where we make love
Honeybear, Honeybear, Honeybear
Fuck the world, damn straight malaise
It may be just us who feel this way
But don't ever doubt this, my steadfast conviction
My love, you're the one I wanna watch the ship go down with
The future can't be real, I barely know how long a moment is
Unless we're naked, getting high on the mattress
While the global market crashes
As death fills the streets we're garden-variety oblivious
You grab my hand and say in "I-told-you-so" voice:
"It’s just how we expected"

[Chorus 1]
Everything is doomed
And nothing will be spared
But I love you, honeybear
Honeybear, honeybear, honeybear

[Verse 2]
You're bent over the altar and the neighbors are complaining
That the misanthropes next door are probably conceiving a Damien
Don't they see the darkness rising? Good luck fingering oblivion
We're getting out now while we can
You're welcome, boys, have the last of the smokes and chicken
Just one Cadillac will do to get us out to where we're going
I've brought my mother's depression
You've got your father's scorn and a wayward aunt's schizophrenia

[Chorus 2]
But everything is fine
Don't give into despair
'Cause I love you, honeybear
Honeybear, honeybear, honeybear

[Verse 1]
Emma eats bread and butter
Like a queen would have ostrich and cobra wine
We’ll have Satanic Christmas Eve
And play piano in the Chateau lobby

[Chorus 1]
I’ve never done this
Baby, be gentle
It’s my first time
I’ve got you inside
People are boring
But you’re something else completely
Damn, let’s take our chances

[Verse 2]
I wanna take you in the kitchen
Lift up your wedding dress someone was probably murdered in
So bourgeoisie to keep waiting
Dating for twenty years just feels pretty civilian

[Chorus 2]
And I’ve never thought that
Ever thought that once in my whole life
You are my first time
People are boring
But you’re something else I can’t explain
Here take my last name

[Bridge]
First time, you let me stay the night despite your own rules
You took off early to go cheat your way through film school
You left a note in your perfect script:
"Stay as long as you want," and I haven’t left your bed since

[Chorus 3]
I haven’t hated
All the same things as somebody else
Since I remember
What’s going on for, uh, what are you doing with your whole life?
How about forever?

[Verse]
When can we talk with a face?
Instead of using all these strange devices
Seems like you and I need to have a crazy conversation

[Pre-Chorus]
Wouldn't be that hard, get along so well
Sentence by sentence
It's a trial run, let me show you how
Figure I can give you true affection

[Chorus]
True affection, true affection (oh, oh)
True affection, true affection (oh, oh)

[Interlude]

[Outro]
When can we talk with a face?
Instead of using all these strange devices
(True affection)
Seems like you and I need to have a crazy conversation
(True affection)
When can we talk with a face?
Figure I can give you true affection
(True affection)
Seems like you and I need to have a crazy conversation
(True affection)
When can we talk with a face?
Figure I can give you true affection

[Verse 1]
Oh, I just love the kind of woman who can walk over a man
And I mean like a god damn marching band
She says, like, literally, music is the air she breathes
And the malaprops make me want to fucking scream
I wonder if she even knows what that word means
Well, it's literally not that

[Verse 2]
Of the few main things I hate about her
One's her petty, vogue ideas
Someone's been told too many times they're beyond their years
By every half-wit of distinction she keeps around
And now every insufferable convo
Features her patiently explaining the cosmos
Of which she's in the middle

[Bridge]
Oh my God, I swear this never happens
Lately, I can't stop the wheels from spinnin'
I feel so unconvincin'
When I fumble with your buttons

[Verse 3]
She blames her excess on my influence
But gladly hoovers all my drugs
I found her naked with her best friend in the tub
We sang "Silent Night" in three parts which was fun
Till she said that she sounds "just like" Sarah Vaughan
I hate that soulful affectation white girls put on
Why don't you move to the Delta?
I obliged later on when you begged me to choke ya

[Verse 1]
Livin' it up
You can have it all
Pull more women than any two men or train can haul
But my baby, she does something way more impressive than the Georgia Crawl
She blackens pages like a Russian romantic
Gets down more often than a blowup doll

[Chorus 1]
Why the long face, Blondie?
I'm already taken – sorry
I may act like a lunatic
But if you think I'm fucking crazy, you're mistaken
Keep moving

[Verse 2]
On the road again
For months at a time
Doesn't take half that long for men about town to forget what's mine
Now my genius can't drink in silence
She's gotta listen to your tired-ass lines
I know it's hard to believe the good-hearted woman
Could have a body that'd make your daddy cry

[Chorus 2]
Why the long face, jerkoff?
Your chance has been taken – good one
You may think like an animal
But if you try that cat-and-mouse shit you'll get bitten
Keep moving

[Verse 1]
You'll only ever be the girl who just almost died in my house
Half naked, looking through your telephone
Run you a bath and try hard not to freak out

[Pre-Chorus]
So free and too easy
Giving it away, giving it away
It's not cheap but here I am
Giving it away, giving it away, giving it away

[Chorus]
Don't be my, don't be my, don't be my last strange encounter
The moment you came to, I swore I would change
Though neither one of us would leave unscathed
At least we'll both go on living

[Verse 2]
Wanna find somebody
But not like this
Yeah, I'm a decent person
Just a little aimless

[Pre-Chorus]
So free and too easy
Giving it away, giving it away
It's not cheap but here I am
Giving it away, giving it away, giving it away

[Chorus]
Don't be my, don't be my, don't be my last strange encounter
The moment you came to, I swore I would change
Though neither one of us would leave unscathed
At least we'll both go on living

[Verse 1]
Julian – he's gonna take my files
Every woman that I've slept with
Every friendship I've neglected
Didn't call when grandma died
I spend my money getting drunk and high
I've done things unprotected
And proceeded to drive home wasted
Bought things to win over siblings
I've said awful things, such awful things

[Refrain]
And now, now it's out
And now, now it's out

[Verse 2]
Julian – he's gonna take my files
Telling people jokes to shut them up
Resenting people that I love
Sleep in 'til two then doing shit
Just stay in bed and later lie about it
Obsessing over graying hair
Knowing just what people wanna hear
Binging on unearned attention
I've said awful things, such awful things

[Refrain]
And now, now it's out
And now, now it's out

[Verse 3]
I came by at seven in the morning
Seven in the morning, seven in the morning
I came by at seven in the morning
I said, "Baby, I'm finally succumbing!"
Said something dumb like, "I'm tired of running
Tired of running, tired of running"
Let's put a baby in the oven!
Wouldn't I make the ideal husband?

[Verse 1]
Ancient holy wars
Dead religions, holocausts
New regimes, old ideas
That's now myth, that's now real
Original sin, genetic fate
Revolutions, spinning plates
It's important to stay informed
The commentary to comment on

[Chorus 1]
Oh, and no one ever really knows you
And life is brief
So I've heard, but what's that gotta do with
This black hole in me?

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Age-old gender roles
Infotainment, capital
Golden boughs and mercury
Bohemian nightmare
Dust-bowl chic
This documentary's lost on me
Satirical news, free energy
Mobile lifestyle, loveless sex
Independence, happiness

[Chorus 2]
Oh, and no one ever knows the real you
And life is brief
So I've heard, but what's that gotta do with
This atom bomb in me?

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
Colosseum families
The golden era of TV
Eunuch sluts, consumer slaves
A rose by any other name
Carbon footprint, incest dreams
Fuck the mother in the green
Planet cancer, sweet revenge
Isolation, online friends

[Outro]
Oh, and love is just an institution based on human frailty
What's your paradise gotta do with Adam and Eve?
Maybe love is just an economy based on resource scarcity
What I fail to see is what that's gotta do
With you and me
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
We met in a parking lot
I was buying coffee and cigarettes
Firewood and bad wine long since gone
But I'm still drunk and hot
Wide awake and breathing hard
Now, in just one year's time
I've become jealous, rail-thin, prone to paranoia when I'm stoned
If this isn't true love, someone oughta put me in a home
Say, do you wanna get married?
And put an end to our endless progressive tendency to scorn
Provincial concepts like your dowry and your Daddy's farm
For love to find us of all people
I never thought it'd be so simple

[Verse 2]
Let's buy a plantation house
And let the yard grow wild until we don't need the signs that say, "Keep out"
I've got some money left and it's cheaper in the South
I need someone I can trust
To protect me from our seven daughters when my body says "enough"
Don't let me die in a hospital
I'll save the big one for the last time we make love
Insert here:
A sentiment re: our golden years
All cause I went to the store one day
"I've seen you around, what's your name?"

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
(Pow)
30-something shots from the ghetto gun
All in the ears of the ghetto young
Some ghetto girls, some ghetto sons
Throwing rocks at the bus and other ghetto fun
I always wondered where the ghetto from
Cause I'm from the ghetto, the never ghetto come
Buzz you in if the bell of my ghetto rung
And if the ghetto lose, that mean a ghetto won
That's how they do the ghetto, that's how the ghetto done
They keep it, they never bring the ghetto none
What make the ghetto tick, make the ghetto run
What make the ghetto sick, make the ghetto dumb
These niggas off that ghetto beer and that ghetto rum
And that ghetto bass with my ghetto drums
And my ghetto words and these ghetto problems get ghetto sums
That's why the...

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco & Ty Dolla $ign]
Pizza man don't come here no more
Too much dope, too many niggas on the porch
So the pizza man don't approach (no, no, no)
Pizza man don't come here no more
Too many niggas on the block, too many niggas getting shot
So the pizza man don't stop (pow, pow, pow)
Pizza man don't come here no more
Too many niggas getting robbed, niggas don't wanna starve
But "Niggas ain't got no jobs, blah blah blah"
Pizza man don't come here no more
Deliver, deliver, deliver

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Is it cause they're selling nicks out there all day
Cause a prostitute sucking dick in the hallway
Little Caesar's never sending pizza out y'all way
Papa Johns never get delivered where y'all stayed
The ghetto was a physical manifestation
Of hate in a place where ethnicity determines your placement
A place that defines your station
Remind you niggas your  place is the basement
White people in the attic
Niggas selling dope, White people is the addicts
White folks act like they ain't show us how to traffic
All that dope to China, you don't call that trappin'?
Breaking Bad, learned that from a TV
So don't say it's politics when you see me
When you gon' apologize for your CD
Nigga, that don't match red and black to a GD

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco & Ty Dolla $ign]
Pizza man don't come here no more
Too much dope, too many niggas on the porch
So the pizza man don't approach (no, no, no)
Pizza man don't come here no more
Too many niggas on the block, too many niggas getting shot
So the pizza man don't stop (pow, pow, pow)
Pizza man don't come here no more
Too many niggas getting robbed, niggas don't wanna starve
But "Niggas ain't got no jobs, blah blah blah"
Pizza man don't come here no more
Deliver, deliver, deliver

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, uh, can I get delivered from the sin?
Get a little slice of Heaven, I can enter in again
Or maybe just imagine that I'm living in a mansion
Or a palace and my pizza gets delivered in a Benz
Make a savior out of savage like they made it out of magic
So it take a nigga havoc and then make it into friends
You don't even need a salad, that don't make a nigga fatter
Actually take a nigga backwards and make a nigga thin
That's a deep dish, Chicago town, get the peace stick
Home run hitter, I be drilling on the weak pitch
Pay into the plate then I put it in your face
I'm a man, never biting on the hands that I eat with, yeah
No Giordano or DiGiorno
Homemade Bull City bring it to him like a toro
Throwing dough up in the air-bottom to the top and shredder
Full of cheese smarter than a purple ninja turtle, nigga

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco & Ty Dolla $ign]
Pizza man don't come here no more
Too much dope, too many niggas on the porch
So the pizza man don't approach (no, no, no)
Pizza man don't come here no more
Too many niggas on the block, too many niggas getting shot
So the pizza man don't stop (pow, pow, pow)
Pizza man don't come here no more
Too many niggas getting robbed, niggas don't wanna starve
But "Niggas ain't got no jobs, blah blah blah"
Pizza man don't come here no more (here no more)
Deliver, deliver, deliver

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign]
So sad cause the pizza man don't fuck wit us no more
No, no, no, no, no, no

We certainly have an unspoken understanding
But a lot of things unsaid as well

[Voice: Stephen Hawking]
Speech has allowed the communication of ideas, enabling human beings to work together to build the impossible
Mankind's greatest achievements have come about by talking
Our greatest hopes could become reality in the future, with the technology at our disposal, the possibilities are unbounded

All we need to do is make sure we keep talking

She the one
Make a nigga wanna get into some fun with you tonight, oh
Would you like that, shawty? Oh you like that?
I knew you would, I knew you would
She live in Toronto
Fucked around and picked her up
Then brought her to my condo, lay down on her designer girl
Oh, it feels good to lay down, let's get good
Hustler gets the pussy, it feel like we ballin'
Only thousand on the score
But we ain't playing games no more, not up In here
I guess you put in your place and you got that look on your face

[Pre-Chorus]
You a good girl, have some fun with it
All my hood girls, you the one with it
So let no nigga tell you different, you for me
Even when she with you, she knows that's what she for be

[Chorus]
That girl is mine, oh yeah she mine
And damn she fine, she knows that shit
I would cuff her too but she loving you
Might be fucking you but I fuck her too
That girl is mine

[Verse 2]
We got something special, you guys paired up, sold up, boo
We fucking it for pleasure, I fuck with the professor
Do you got that shit that make that body go around
And got that shit in paper view, I watch it going down
You up on the screen, see it in high definition
I'ma hit the scene, drop it down and get position
For a nigga
For a young nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
You a good girl, have some fun with it
Of my hood girls, you the one with it
So let no nigga tell you different, you for me
Even when she with you, she knows that's what she for be

[Chorus]
That girl is mine, oh yeah she mine
And damn she fine, she knows that shit
I would cuff her too but she loving you
Might be fucking you but I fuck her too

And damn she fine, she knows that shit
I would cuff her too but she loving you
Might be fucking you but I fuck her too
That girl is mine

And damn she fine, she knows that shit

Might be fucking you but I fuck her too

[Intro: Skylar Grey]
Oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but I'ma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said, "This nigga buggin'"
'Cause I was doin' it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplatin' overdosin'
No more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I shoulda asked all along
I'ma ask on the song

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears rolled down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hopin' that you would show it some
What the fuck you really tellin' me? What you tellin' me?
I could tell you lyin', get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I shoulda asked all along
I'ma ask on the song

[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
So does she know I've been in that bed before? (Bed before)
A thousand count and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl (Another girl)
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me when you're not so busy
Just thinkin' of yourself (Thinkin' of yourself)

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

Hmmm
Hmmm
Hmmm

[Verse 1]
Give me your bundles of rubber
Enough wit' the rambling, get under my covers
Enough for the fam and I bundle my numbers
I crumble my bread
Come up with hundreds
I'm losing my head
Keeping the bread
Even the cheese with the reffer in reach
Keeping it iller then feverish fiends
Keeping it clean, sike
Speak of the evil and me
I'm sorta like demons and queens
I got all these people in me
Sorry my alternate ego is speakin'
People unbreathe when I get mean
Eat my fajita or get out my team
Lick up a swisher and lean
Like evil knievel
I beat the grime reaper
Ignite like a feaver

[Hook]
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene

I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene

[Verse 2]
Eat it like a cannibal
I'm not from your planet, ho
I ain't the quick fix, I'm the antidote
I get kicks out of trix but I banish hoes
Like the hannibal
Bitches wanna bite
No mandible
Like an animal
Imbalance is in my chemicals
Get calluses from the pencil grip
Asking Alice if this is wonderland
Like Erika I don’t understand
I don't understand, bitch
Twisted in the mind
I don’t think that we're in Kansas
So this is what the plan is

[Bridge]
Like a cannibal
Just like a cannibal
Like a cannibal

[Hook]
'Cause I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm- like a cannibal
Like a cannibal
Like a cannibal
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
Like a cannibal
Like a cannibal
Like a cannibal
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
Fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene

Sexy antics, so suggestive
Get that money girl, so progressive
So infectious, so enticing

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Man, she punched me like a dude
Hold your mad hands, I cried
‘Tis a pity she was a whore
‘Tis my curse, I suppose
That was patrol
That was patrol
This is the war

[​Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Black struck the kiss, he kept my cock
Smote the mistress, drifting on
‘Tis a pity she was a whore
She stole my purse, with rattling speed
That was patrol
This is the war
‘Tis a pity she was a whore

[Bridge 2]​​

[Verse 3]
Man, she punched me like a dude
Hold your mad hands, I cried
‘Tis a pity she was a whore
‘Tis my fate, I suppose
For, that was patrol
That was patrol
‘Tis a pity she was a whore

[Outro]
‘Tis a pity she was a whore
Woo!
Ahh! Woo!

[Chorus: Dej Loaf & Trick Trick]
Tell 'em, if they want it

I just want less (Static)
S!ee me, they salute me
They ain't ready for that (Static)
D!etroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9", Big Sean, Trick Trick]
Uh
I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise
And now things changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority
Then he shall see shells, but not by the seashore if he gangbangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet, he F with me
That G shall surely see, he definitely as 'bout it
As retail fraud, he's weak, the honest gesture
The trigger finger round the diamond tester, we tell flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' round shootin' my biopic in my autobiography Range Rover
This ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' make-up, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
The twin Eagles'll air his coupe, might as well ride by in an ambulance
My pair'll shoot, like skydivin' in Hammer pants
So call it sibling rivalry
Take his life; call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent-free (Real talk!)
I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea (That's Nickel)
Ridin' round his block
All he know is pitfalls, that's why he always climbin' out his drop
(I got a question) Do you wanna ride or die?
(Welcome to Detroit, motherfucka!) (Sean Don)

[Verse 2: Big Sean, Trick Trick]
Boy, I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety
Hundred percent cut; no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit, where if you get that promotion
Don't worry, man, them bullets will still be at your ass firin' (Brr, brr)
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'
Boy, I hit the beat, and just treat that shit like a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me
Self-made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see
I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy, so I put my dog in the 'Vette (Swerve)
Ahh! Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch
If the ball in my hand, then the ball in the net (Net)
Bitch, I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me (Me)
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me (Me)
I'm over-respected
My mama gated community's overprotective
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway
Now my closet fifty shades of grey
26, and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church, tryna get a little savings, yeah, a coupon (God)
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Takin' down my number, like, "You still ain't got a new line?"
(You still ain't got a new line?)
Nah, it's the same, we been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than nine months
But fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach, with dreams of bein' a Beatle
Don't want to, I need to, ya gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place
Where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel (Let's go,) il' bitch!

[Chorus: Dej Loaf & Trick Trick]
Tell 'em, if they want it
They can come get that (Static)
I swear I love my city
I just want less (static)
See me, they salute me
They ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from failin', that's why they call it the D
Arguably the whole reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honored up in them streets
‘Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas hit ya
Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
If you think your hood harder, then I might beg to differ
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Miller
If the blicka hit ya kisser, bet yo' ass not rememberin'
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissorin'
So, nigga, I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
Have K's in front of your school, but I ain't goin' to Kettering
Cough up a lung, 313 where I'm from
Xan got me cross-eyed like Bernstein’s son
Any nigga try to copy, put a hole in his top
It's us vs. them, Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Lately it seems as if it's me against
The world, like it was before my life became a movie and they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like a refill of
Painkillers to pop the lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, Navy SEAL of bravery
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
Ain't bein' conceited, but I made it to radio—eat a dick!
I still never ABC this shit
Mainstream appeal, but the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee "Dilla"
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' these streets
I swear that I would stay here still
And if I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here
And take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from
On a rampage too crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch?
‘Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's ragin' and heated and
On the way to go beat his kid?
On a track get spanked like he just did
(Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like we ain't shit
But Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me
To do features and them cyphers on BET, ‘cause if
I wasn't me I prob'ly wouldn't
Wanna play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' its fever pitch
Hundred and eighty degrees in here
Shoulder blade full of cedar chips
MC's just bit off more than they can chew
Like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and geniusness inconvenience
And for the record, you don't want this type of static
In your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it
May consider tryna reinsulate your windows
May be in for another crazy winter
‘Cause so cold in the D, it is
As days begin to tick away, but ain't this really
What made me into the angry bitter blonde?
But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs?
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this pit
May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit
Or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with you, but ain't shit changin'
It's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter
With a potato peeler
And mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
Or the Bermuda Triangle and
Attempted to make a safe descent
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here? And if they mention us…

[Chorus: Dej Loaf]
Tell 'em, if they want it
They can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city
I just want less (static)
See me, they salute me
They ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Outro: Trick Trick]
What up though? It's the godfather Trick Trick
You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on
That means Detroit vs. Everybody!!
Hey, Em, let me get that instrumental
Take it down to the hood
Let the little homies get this remix crackin'!
Detroit! Okay!

[Verse 1: Cody Simpson]
I don't work harder when it's easy
I put in work when it's hard
Girl I never believed in love until I had yours
This is more than a season
And I'm not just sprung
I'm not afraid to tell you that you're the one

[Pre-Chorus: Cody Simpson]
The one I wake up thinking about
The one I can run to when I'm feeling down
Life is all good when you're around
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now

[Chorus: Cody Simpson]
Because I'll take you home to mama
Let you meet my friends
Because you don't come with drama
So I want you 'til the world ends
You're way more than worth it
But I don't feel like I deserve it
You got the pieces, you're my kind of perfect

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I don't work hard when it's easy
I put in work when it's hard
And girl I never believed in love until I had yours
This is more than a season and I'm not just sprung
I'm not afraid to tell you, that you're the one

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm the one I wake up thinking about
The one I can run to when I'm feeling down
Life is all good when you're around
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Because I'll take you home to mama
I'll let you meet my friends
Because you don't come with drama
So I want you 'til the world ends
You're way more than worth it
And I don't feel like I deserve it
You got the pieces, you're my kind of perfect
You're my kind of perfect

[Intro]
It's too bad, it's too bad
It's too bad, it's too bad, baby
But I gotta face reality
It's too bad, it's too bad
Too bad, baby
But I gotta face reality

[Verse 1]
Today you had a visitor, or should I say an old friend
But wait a minute, that's not where it ends, no
Is there something that you wanna tell me?
Mmm, 'cause I'm believing what your friends say
About your hidden secrecies

[Pre-Chorus]
And girlfriend, she wasn't disrespectful
(In fact) She's a hundred percent sure
And how could I argue with her
Holding a baby with eyes like yours?

[Chorus]
She said it's your child, and it really messed me up
How could you deny your own flesh and blood?
Gotta face reality, there can be never be anymore us
Won't deny it's hurting me, yet so precious

[Verse 2]
She said she never wanted to hurt me
And could I understand, she's afraid and lost
She said a real woman wouldn't do this over the phone
And that you told her about me after the baby was born

[Pre-Chorus]
And girlfriend, she wasn't disrespectful
(In fact) She's a hundred percent sure
And how could I argue with her
Holding a baby with eyes like yours?

[Chorus]
She said it's your child, and it really messed me up
(Really messed me up)
How could you deny your own flesh and blood?
Gotta face reality, there can be never be anymore us
Won't deny it's hurting me, yet so precious
(She said) She said it's your child, and it really messed me up
How could you deny your own flesh and blood?
Gotta face reality, there can be never be anymore us
(There can never be anymore us)
Won't deny it's hurting me, yet so precious (so precious)

[Bridge]
Oh, the baby looks just like you
How could you deny your own flesh and blood?
Your own child
What kind of man are you?

[Pre-Chorus]
And girlfriend, she wasn't disrespectful
(In fact) She's a hundred percent sure
Oh, and how could I argue with her
Holding a baby with eyes like yours?

[Chorus]
She said it's your child, and it really messed me up
How could you deny your own flesh and blood?
Gotta face reality, there can be never be anymore us
Won't deny it's hurting me, yet so precious
She said it's your child, and it really messed me up
How could you deny your own flesh and blood?
Gotta face reality, there can be never be anymore us
(There can never be you and me)
Won't deny it's hurting me, yet so precious

[Verse 1: M.I.A.]
I fly like paper get high like planes
If you catch me on the border I got visas in my name
If you come around here I'll make 'em all day
I'll get one done in a second of you wait
I fly like paper get high like planes if you catch me on the border I got visas in my name
If you come around here I'll make 'em all day
I'll get one done in a second of you wait
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains
Every step I get, I'm clockin' that game
Everyone's a winner, we make 'em off fame
Bona fide hustler making my name
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains
Every step I get, I'm clockin' that game
Everyone's a winner, we make 'em off fame
Bona fide hustler making my name

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)

All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)

All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)

[Verse 2: Rye Rye]
She fly like paper get high like planes
Tryna keep her from the US but she stronger than a gang
Cause she got a lot of fame messin' with the wrong name
I'm following the footsteps from the hood to the music game
My city on fire ain't no need to put it out
And I'm bout set it off its like I power in my mouth
And I'm bout to bring it out to the world
I want to touch the clouds, want to be your nature girl
I feel the rain and it's tellin' me to go far
I feel the pain and it's tellin' me the music hard
Should I stay, should I go I don't know I'm kind of lost
But I'm aiming for success I'm really sorry if you don't
Neva take drugs but I'm highed up
All the music from my MC in the hood growin' up
It gets hard when you're tryna blow it up
So stressful, you say fuck it, you be like "I'm givin' up"

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money

[Verse 3: Afrikan Boy]
I was at home, making my visas
Slippin' on my government, yeah you seen how we does man
I'm fresh from Lagos, fresh from Nigeria
If I look angry, it's cause someone stole my visa
If you walk into my kitchen you will see the white powder
I'll be by the cooker, whipping at you harder
Don't be alarmed I'm just cookin' pounded yam
Afrikan Boy, I never be a drug dealer
I wrap and sell pepe in the markets of Abuja
I'm a legend, something like Jay-Jay Okocha
My name is Olushola, I just got off my visa
I live everyday like it's the first of October
The greatest hustler on Earth I know is my mother
Like mother, like son, familiar like my father
Birds of the same flow share the same feather
I just want to make my dollar and my Niara

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money

[Bridge: M.I.A.]
M.I.A., third world democracy
I got more records than the KGB
So, uh, no funny business (you already are)
Some, some, some I, some I murder
Some I, some I let go
Some, some, some I, some I murder
Some I, some I let go

[Verse 1]
Help me, I think I'm falling in love again
When I get that crazy feeling, I know I'm in trouble again
I'm in trouble 'cause you're a rambler and a gambler
And a sweet taIking ladies man

[Chorus]
And you love your lovin'
But not like you love your freedom

[Verse 2]
Help me, I think I'm falling in love too fast
It's got me hoping for the future and worrying about the past
'Cause I've seen some hot hot blazes
Come down to smoke and ash

[Chorus]
We love our lovin'
But not like we love our freedom

[Bridge]
Didn't it feel good, we were sitting there talking?
Or lying there not talking, didn't it feel good?
You dance with the lady with the hole in her stocking
Didn't it feel good, didn't it feel good?

[Verse 3]
Help me, I think I'm falling in love with you
Are you going to let me go there by myself?
That's such a lonely thing to do
Both of us flirting around flirting and flirting, hurting too

[Chorus]
We love our lovin'
But not like we love our freedom

[Chorus]
Rare is this love
Keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding

[Verse 1]
Oh but the farrow know
Her hungry eyes, her ancient soul
It's carried by the sneering menagerie
Know what it is to grow
Beneath her sky, her punishing cold
To slowly learn of her ancient misery
To be twisted by something
A shame without a sin
Like how she twisted the bog man
After she married him

[Chorus]
Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding

[Verse 2]
But in all the world
There is one lover worthy of her
With as many souls claimed as she
But for all he's worth
He still shatters always on her earth
The cause of every tear she'd ever weep
Rushing to shore to meet her
Foaming with loneliness
White hands to fondle and beat her
Give her his onliness

[Chorus]
Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding
Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding
Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding
Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding

[Hook]
Now I don't know what you been told about me
(I don't know what you thought but the real is)
But I don't take no shit from no nigga
(And all niggas, no exceptions homeboy)
And I wonder what my kids think about me
If I went to jail
(If I had to, would you love me)
Cause I had to kill me a nigga

[Verse 1]
Aye I'm hoping for the best tryna dodge the stress
But sometimes that just ain't the way that it go
Hey if a nigga pull up on me at the light and it's a choppa in site
Felon or not bet I be lettin' it go
I gotta make it back home
Major need me to cut his cartoons on
My baby Déjà catchin' feelings bout everything she sensitive
And King love money
I need to show him how to get it den
Damonie need me to tell em
You wanna rap then take it serious then
Play thing it never been
All I did was get it in
Neke Neke need a nigga to know what a real nigga is
Messiah need me to show him how I broke a deal
So imagine if I went and got killed
Get real nigga
And you know everyday we out here in the field
Gettin' it how we live
Fuck a record deal
Put my money with yo money
All we do is get mo money
But you know what I gotta do when someone trying to take it from me now

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Disrespect me and we have to shoot it out in the street
Fuck it that's just how that shit have to be
I gotta drum on the C
So the carpet spit 50 at least
Message to all who wanna see me deceased
Come and get you a piece
You think I'm poutin' nigga
Slice me and eat
Boy ain't went one day out my life I was sweet
Except for to her
See she need me to keep it Couture
And buy her all the fancy shit she prefer
She ain't get it though
But you gotta play yo part for a nigga though
Fuck a bitch stay away from dem niggas though
Cause you gon have me kickin in a nigga though
Wavin' pistols fuck you nigga
Bitch go get yo shit let's go
Or do you need me to let you go
Find a rich nigga buy a house so I can move next dough
Sit there and watch yo new husband as he pull out the garage
Watch you tip toe in that doe so I can kill you den run
You so impressed with them niggas
You know dis ain't no faćade
I'll pull my tech on them niggas
And get em closer to God
You say I find the worst in er'ythang I see
But I love hard
That's somethin' you know about me
Girl you know about me aye

[Hook]

[Outro]
You know what I'm sayin'
I know I had a lot of fucked up shit goin' on in my life
And this shit god damn
It's in my head and in my heart man
It ain't on me, it's in me
You know what I'm sayin'
And and maybe I haven't developed enough
To where I can communicate In a way that'll keep me
From doing somethin' that'll trip my life off the streets my nigga
So if separation is tha best
Den I respectfully say I love you to god damn death
And all my children
If I have to dome me a nigga out here
Please just come see me man
When you can man
Lemme see my grand kids
But I'll be gotdamned
If a mafucka' take you from me man
I put my mafuckin' life on that
Kill or be killed nigga
I see you in the morning
Wearing only one shoe

I say, I see you've lost something
What're you gonna do?

You say but no, I found one
There's another out there for you

I see us all as customers
Holding no purchase so far

Collapsing galaxies
Feathered with falling stars

I see us all as something
But nothing like we truly are

Why don't you come to me now
More like you are
I know we should be grateful
Everything is falling apart

Everything is breaking
And it lifts my heart

To see you as an angel
As some ghostly work of art

Why don't you come to me now
Know who you are

[Intro]
Yeah!
Biyatch!
Brrrrrat!
(Laughs)

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Take ten, then ya reach for ya gun
Leave a nigga laying out to leak in the sun
I can't, be a bitch about a G on the run
Wanted in 50 cities for depletin' they funds
Bitch i'm an outlaw
Swing right hand, southpaw
Blaze fire to the ceiling make they house fall
Paranoid so whenever I'm in doubt, draw
I'm getting money muthafucka what about y'all?
Raw from the womb, the tomb
Under the moon for your saloon with goons
Bitch, we making it rain, a monsoon platoon
Steady bringing the pain, my next dues at noon, fully loaded!
Swear that imma bring it to whoever really want it
Done with these beginners nigga, show me my opponent, and
Please know we smoking weed all day
Haters want a nigga DOA

Young nigga gettin' to the money, UH!

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Im an outlaw, you better know who we are (we are)
Killas that's who we are (that's who we are)
Make him take a visit to the D.R. (Hm? Yeahhh)
Aim and squeeze an AR-16 bar
Can't find me on the radar
I'm off it in a beam-off
I'll choke you like a mean cough
Don't consider me a boss
Nigga I am the boss
He tried to front I took his shines, then he ran D. Moss
Flunkin' ass niggas just coated can-dy straws
Park her like a sea saw
Come around my block and give my niggas cut your feet off
Hodgy Beats!
He at the beach gettin' beat off
That's because a nigga hot chilly sauce, you weak sauce
Fully Loaded!
My guns is tired, sweatin' tombs of fire
Feedin penalties of death like Dennis McGuire
I'm gettin' Even Steven on you Lizzy McGuires

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Any man that doesn't want to cooperate, i'll make him wish he hadn't been born

[Verse 3: Domo Genesis]

Drugs, Money, and Sex
The Wild West, we about all
Word up to Pac, i'm an Outlaw
Uh!

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
It's all black
Your kingdom's turned me blank
I'm paper and I'm snow
I'm lost but I can't slow
I'm lost but not alone
It's so light
The dark it burns my eyes
My bones, they used to glow
But now I'm throwing stones
I'm losing where to go

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Shadows on my back are moving slow
They twist behind like white leaves in the wind
And as I ride, these horses will take flight
Falling hard, falling high, through your arms
Shadows in my head don't need no light
They stay through the night

[Verse 2: Charli XCX]
Without you, my lips are turning blue
The water pulls me down
And drowns under your sound
This silence booms so loud
I'm locked up
Your kingdom's like a drug
The chains are made of glass
I'm breaking through your blood
I'm never strong enough

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Shadows on my back are moving slow
They twist behind like white leaves in the wind
And as I ride, these horses will take flight
Falling hard, falling high, through your arms
Shadows in my head don't need no light
They stay through the night

[Verse 3: Simon Le Bon]
To every rose with bloody thorn
It lifts you up and lets you fall
To rivers flowing yond the factory halls
Your kingdom's come, it's waiting still
The space between you'll never fill
I tried but I could not change your mind

[Outro: Charli XCX]
I dance around, and I lost you now
I breathed you out, I kept you out
But if I could, I'd turn back around

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]

Interview with Bang Tidy MusicInterviewer: New track "HNSCC" from Music For Cars is a far cry from what you’ve done before, especially the fact it features no lyrics. What was the idea behind the track?

Matty Healy: My Nana who I was close to died of cancer this year and it was around about that time that the guitarist’s mum got diagnosed with cancer and it felt like it was a big impact, the fact that something you have no control over can really mess with the dynamics of people’s lives. It’s actually a live guitar take. I was playing the guitar plugged in the computer and George was putting it through every plugin you can imagine. He recorded it without telling me so I was in the zone. This was 2am on a Saturday night so we were under the influence. I recorded the guitar take and we listened to it back hammered and we were like ‘this is really pretty man, nah let’s get some sleep’. We woke up the next day and we just spent like half an hour putting little moments of vocals and synth and that was that. I think Music for Cars is the most honest record in regards to things like that

[Intro:]
You know what
I don't have to answer to you
You ain't my bitch
Know 'whaa I sayin?
So shit man, fuck it!

[Verse 1:]
I got the whole world scared like ebola nigga
I told my bitch share with her friend like Coca-Cola nigga
I can't recall the last time I was sober nigga
One life to live
I think I'm gonna be dranking till it's over nigga
Fuck my liver and my lungs im a stoner
If they go bad, Ima find me a donor
Ran out of rolling papers up at the crib
Fucked around and smoked on my high school diploma
Im smart (I'm smart)
You could say I got the highest grade man
Yo bitch for my bitch naw thats not really a trade man
My life is a little bit different than yours
Bitches are a little bit thicker than yours
Whips are a little bit quicker than yours
And my crib is a little bit sicker than yours
God bless the child that's got his own nigga
I phone my lawyers like E.T. be phoning home nigga
Like where that check, get that check
Everyday nigga better chase that check
Fans head bobbing to the verse that I spit
But I won't be satisfied till they break that neck
That's Luda (That's Luda)
I swear that nigga be going ham samich
And these rappers couldn't leave their mark in ce-ment
With they hands planted
Yall here for today
Gone by tonight
Sell a couple records and it's all by he height
Niggas do it for a little fame and some change
I do it for hip hop, turntables, and a mic
Im still right in my chapter in that rapper hall of fame nigga
Hip hop's my stomping ground, go back to where you came nigga
Hahahaa
This earth will burn and rot away one day
If we're still here we'll die a painful death
We are so different
But we think that we're more than just animals
But we're not, we've just got more technical with time
The only reason I can say this is because we comprehend it and we argue just to exercise our mind!

Alas, get back!! To what you were saying about how we all have a soul
What's a soul? It's out of your control!

It's out of your control

I don't know what god is, but I know what he isn't
A white man in the clouds, who we should constantly be pleasing!

No more brainwashing for me
Find a different host!

They're words on paper
I'm sure that two fish couldn't read
Too bad they had the chance to learn
Alas, get back!! To what you were saying about how we all have a soul
What's a soul??
It's out of your control

Before we wrote this song, we only thought about it
And then before the words, we only hummed the rhythm
I'm grateful for the chance, to release all this tension
I'm coping with the thought, that we might be inventions!

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Bi-yatch!
Uhhhhhh, fuck
Here we go
Uh

[Verse 1]
Say we ballin' like you fixed up, ya shit luck
I'm the object of ya bitch lust, give her swift nuts
Don't get it mixed up
We know the Devil trynna kiss it
If the money make it spin the whole world is a strip club
Strollin' out the hall of flames, with the alcoholic's brain
For all the rain I ever bottled trynna swallow pain
I'm heartless show my words like gauntlets through your hallow frame
Another loss, nigga out here carrying my father's name
I'm burnin' y'all as hot as gets
I'm bout to take another win that's just some obvious shit, my hobbie's legit
Persuasion on some lobby shit
I'm poppin' thot's giving me top in the whip
Without a option gotta feel me
Pound or Marijuana gotta nigga feeling ill-y
Fuck a bitch really, i'm just trynna count a quarter-milly
Let them Eagle's fly, no significance to Philly
If a nigga pull a V.I.C, get silly
The last of a real, fuck denying man
Devil on a man, I'm jumping out the frying pan
Keep myself busy, nothing like the movie Idle Hands
I need one to hold the world and light the grams
I'm tryin fam, 'tho them Vulture niggas trynna get me
I thrived easy on them niggas like Lionel Richie
I'm just sayin', I tried to told em wasn't make believe
I made it up now, maybe it was Maybelline
And I ain't even had to show up, bitch I made the team
Making money making niggas envy gainin' green
Gainin' green gotta cut them niggas off man
Hot nigga hittin' jumpers with my off hand (Swish!)
Imma kill them niggas
Hydrocodone in my system, I don't feel them niggas
I'm trynna shine a little light on you bewildered niggas
You would cower in the power of some realer niggas
Raw classics, unfiltered nigga

[Outro]
What you see is what you get, right?
Yeah, i'm on them niggas tougher than a fist fight
Lord willin', i'm exactly what your bitch like
Just wait till I get my shit right (x3)

[Skit]
THE DEVIL IS A MOTHERFUCKIN' LIAR. SO YOU KNOW I AIN'T WORRIED, BI-YOTCH! Stupid BITCH!
(Chorus)
My baby mother be buggin soon as I walked in the door
Got me like "I ain't fuckin with that bitch no more"
Don't even like her so I can't fuk with her
Thinkin cause we got a kid together, I'm stuck with her, nah
My baby mother be buggin soon as I walked in the door
Got me like "I ain't fuckin with that bitch no more"
Don't even like her so I can't fuck with her
Thinkin cause we got a kid together, I'm stuck with her, nah

[DMX]
My baby's motha be buggin, she one of them plastic bitches
One of them talk shit, and then get they ass kicked bitches
Once upon a story, yall niggas know the story
And that everything is lovely when it's all about the glory
But soon as shit hit the fan, honies be wanna take the kid and scram
I'm having evil thoughts, don't like how dark it's getting man
From the time I wake up and get dressed
I get stressed, and hardly ever get rest
It's '96, so I'm on some different shit cousin
She ain't gon have me listen to that riffin shit buggin
I got moves to make and mad shit to do
Her friends are looking good so I might hit the crew
It's like one and two that might get a nigga that big and happy
And I know them bitches will fuck me cause when I see 'em, they be winkin at me
You listenin thinkin that's a crazy brother
But I'm gon have to be a father who ain't fuckin with his baby motha
(Chorus)
My baby mother be buggin soon as I walked in the door
Got me like "I ain't fuckin with that bitch no more"
Don't even like her so I can't fuk with her

My baby mother be buggin soon as I walked in the door
Got me like "I ain't fuckin with that bitch no more"
Don't even like her so I can't fuck with her
Thinkin cause we got a kid together, I'm stuck with her, nah

[DMX]
Bitches be callin the cops, thinkin they callin the shots
Takin the good with the bad baby it's all in the pot
So do yo thing, cause I'm doin mine boo
A nigga just been chillin, I been just fine, and you?
I kicked it with my honey and she put me on to something
You gon think until you really see me gone, I'm frontin
Maybe if you kept your friends of respectable distance
Out of our business, I wouldn't have to come and visit
I thought you knew, that the shit you like you do switchin clothes
When them bitches crew, ain't to kosher when they hoes
But that ain't never stopped yo ass from passin on the Guess
Askin for that Coogie sweater, patterned up the breast
Patten up the butt, but you think niggas is stupid
Last week yo shit was like the dog, look at it now, too big
I ain't gon blow yo shit no more, I shouldn't be even did that
Cause you my baby motha, and I'ma always hit that
(Chorus)
My baby mother be buggin soon as I walked in the door
Got me like "I ain't fuckin with that bitch no more"
Don't even like her so I can't fuk with her
Thinkin cause we got a kid together, I'm stuck with her, nah
My baby mother be buggin soon as I walked in the door
Got me like "I ain't fuckin with that bitch no more"
Don't even like her so I can't fuck with her
Thinkin cause we got a kid together, I'm stuck with her, nah

[DMX]
My baby mother be buggin soon as I walked in the door
Got me like "I ain't fuckin with this bitch no more"
Give me a Puerto Rican honey that cook rice and beans
And hair down to her ass, who looks nice in them jeans
So I can be like "Damn, you looking good and I wanna fuck you"
But you a chicken so when I'm finish, I got a duck you
You laying up like you don't wanna leave
I told you I got a girl but you don't wanna believe
My baby mother be bugging, and if you wanna see what honey do
Be here when she get back and she'll bless you with that .22
But I ain't even fucking with her like that
Cause I know this is the only thing to make her fight back
And to them scheming niggas, go ahead and try your hand
Cause you might get her number, but you'll never be her man
And if you get the pussy, you bets to fuck her some place else
Cause if my son knows your name, I'm gonna take your health
(Chorus)
My baby mother be buggin soon as I walked in the door
Got me like "I ain't fuckin with that bitch no more"
Don't even like her so I can't fuk with her
Thinkin cause we got a kid together, I'm stuck with her, nah
My baby mother be buggin soon as I walked in the door
Got me like "I ain't fuckin with that bitch no more"
Don't even like her so I can't fuck with her
Thinkin cause we got a kid together, I'm stuck with her, nah
Uh. Yea. Uh. If you love something let it go, if it
Comes back to you it's yours. If it doesn't, it never was
Hold me down baby

Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day

Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day

Hold me down, niggas wanna know me now
Didn't want ta play wit' me when to show me how
No meow
Is it all about the bark?
Let the dog lose baby it's about to spark
Light up the night, like the 4th of July
Niggas know, when I let go, niggas die
Wit' this Y and you don't know you slow like Baltimore
If you ain't tryin' ta go ya blow
I soak up all the pain and accept it in silence
When I let go it's violence cause the wildest
Leaves the dog barkin' up the tree for the cat
In the fog but ya'll niggas see is the bat
Flappin' away wit' em blind like Stevy
Niggas don't hear me, still tryin' to see me
Stop being greedy, ya heard what I said
Let me go, let me flow on my bed
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day

Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day

I sold my soul to the devil, and the price was cheap
A yo it's cold on this level cause it's twice as deep
But you don't hear me, ignorance is bliss and so on
Sometimes it's better to be thought dumb
Shall I go on
You don't want no real, what the deal is a mystery
How is it I can live and make history
If you don't see it then it, wasn't ment for you to see
If you wasn't born wit' it then, it wasn't ment for you to be
But you can't blame me for not wantin' to be hound
Lock down in a cell wit' a soul gettin' dwelled
This is hell, go get the devil and get me the key
But can't be worst than the curse that was given ta me
It's what I live for, you take away that and I'm gone
There's a difference between, doin' wrong and being wrong
And that ain't right
Just keep it fair baby
Put me in the year, and I'll take it there baby
Yes
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day

Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day

I'm a flow regardless because I'm an artist until I'm trapped
I'ma continue to hit the hardest whether I scrap or rap
Give me death but you ain't my friend
I see it in your eyes, you contemplate my end
You waitin' for that bend in the road, where you were told
That you would go, when you were old
And if you died young, it was told
So what the dilly, what it was worth
Think back 26 years, be like what of his birth
What if it was a miscarriage and I never existed
Have I given something that have been taken away you
Would of missed it
Didn't know, did I persisted?
It was the call of the wild
I'm here to say what's in my heart, and you call it a style
Don't put it in the cage, don't mistreat it
You say you hunger for knowledge, here it is eat it
Another song completed is another thought captured
Let me do my thing I got it locked wit' this rap shit
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day

Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day

Or give me death, uh uh uh, or take my breath
I'ma die anyway, but I'll be gone any day
Where my niggas?
Uh ha ha, for my niggas
Uh ha ha, for my niggas
Uh ha ha, for my niggas

Get em where it counts and, hit em like a mountain
Spit em have em spittin out, blood like a fountain
Don't look at me like that, we just might fight black
And that fight, might end up in me takin your life back

And time is, just too important to be f**kin around
Talk nigga, I stomp a mudhole in your face
Motherf**ker, rip your butthole out of place
Cock the Glock to your head, let off about two in it
Yeah it's a dirty job, but I just love doin in

Bad man, with that BOOM you never had man
Here comes the boom (8X)

[more reggae chatting by Sean Paul & Mr. Vegas]
Here comes the boom (repeat to fade)

[Refrain]
Running away with my heart on my sleeve
A lot of late nights, always thirty one degrees
Your never ever blazing compared to her heart
That's all I ever had, that's what she never got
And what I never got was her, yeah
And what I never got was her

[Verse 1: Usher]
My emotions are just running away with me
Pulling me to my toes, taking me off my feet
Running, yeah I'm running if I know I'll get to where you are
I should think about it, but this happens with my heart

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
And I don't care, baby I'm all in there
Nothing I wouldn't do for you
'Cause the one thing in the world that I'm sure of, baby it's you

[Chorus: Usher]
I'm sold out on this love, it's the only thing I'm sure of
Don't hold out on your love, it's the only thing I'm sure of
But for everything else I'm clueless, stupid, foolish
For everything else I'm clueless, stupid, foolish
For everything else I'm clueless, stupid, foolish
For everything else
For everything else, but you

[Verse 2: Usher]
All of these thoughts they just, follow me to my sleep
Knocking me out my bed, taking away my heap, oh yeah
Running, yeah I'm running in circles trying to get to your heart
I didn't know it'd be this far
Farther than I've ever gone for you

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
And I don't care, baby I'm all in there
Nothing I wouldn't do for you
'Cause the one thing in the world that I'm sure of, baby it's you

[Chorus: Usher]
Oh, I'm sold out on this love, it's the only thing I'm sure of
Don't hold out on your love, it's the only thing I'm sure of
But for everything else I'm clueless, stupid, foolish
For everything else I'm clueless, stupid, foolish
For everything else I'm clueless, stupid, foolish
For everything else
For everything else, but you

[Refrain]
Running away with my heart on my sleeve
A lot of late nights, always thirty one degrees
Your never ever blazing compared to her heart
That's all I ever had, that's what she never got
And what I never got was her, yeah
And what I never got was her

[Bridge: Usher]
Starts thinking for himself, oh yeah
He's thinking for himself now when you're there
Riding in front of the picture in the frame of myself middle of nowhere
He thinking for himself, oh yeah
He's thinking for himself now when you're there
Riding in front of the picture in the frame of myself middle of nowhere
Oohh, yeah yea-yeah, your love
Your love (your love), yea-yeah, your love

[Outro: August Alsina]
Ush, Ush, get up man
Ush, God

[Intro] (x2)
Our hearts got caught in the middle
Caught in the middle of love

[Verse 1]
Took the plane at five
Flew across the world, I'm the other girl
The one who's in your head
Laid there by your side
In the city nights, naked in the lights
Hiding secrets in your bed

[Chorus]
Coz we tried to turn around, but we can't stop it now
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love
You're stuck on my mind
Push restart, press rewind
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love

[Verse 2]
Lost inside the line
Stare across the room, almost fallin' through
Never make the same mistake
Harder every time
Wish we could be true, always wantin' you
We gotta stay a mystery
Oh, I'm caught in the middle, caught in the middle of

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm caught in the middle, caught in the middle of
(Coz we)
Oh, I'm caught in the middle, caught in the middle of
(Coz we)
Oh, I'm caught in the middle, caught in the middle of
(Coz we)
Oh, I'm caught in the middle, caught in the middle of

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love...

[Introduction: Woody Harrelson]
Ladies and gentlemen! My man, Kendrick Lamar!

[Kendrick & Background Vocalists]
Livin' in America
Thuggin' in the trap
Livin' in a groove
Watchin' TV

[Kendrick]
Dedicated to the homies in the pen', hit me!

[Intro]
I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry, yay yay
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me

[Chorus]
(And I love myself)
Uh, when you lookin' at me, uh, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy think they high
(I love myself)
Uh, one day at a time, sun gon' shine

[Verse 1]
Everybody lookin' at you crazy (Crazy)
What you gon' do? (What you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving (Keep moving)
Or let the paranoia haunt you? (Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, huh

[Chorus]
(I love myself)
Uh, when you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Uh, illuminated hands of God, boy don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, sun gon' shine

[Verse 2]
When they say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line full of fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme
(These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation)
Ah man
(I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis)
Uh, dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, the wind could cry now
The strong in me, I still smile

[Chorus]
(I love myself)
Huh, when you lookin' at me, uh, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't be shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, sun gon' shine, everybody, hit me!

[Bridge]
(Walk my bare feet, walk my bare feet)
(Down, down valley deep, down, down valley deep)
(Fi-fie-fo-fum, fi-fie-fo-fum)
(My heart undone, my heart undone)

[Interlude]
Oh man, hey check this out, this a real Compton thing goin' on right now, ya feel what I'm talkin' bout? Ya dig that? Sometimes I just get a little bit beside myself, you know what I'm talkin' bout? This here's the return of Enoch, and we gonna do it to you like this, here we go: one, two, three, hit me!

[Original Chorus]
And I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)

[Verse 3]
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it till I get it right
War last night
I've been dealing with depression, duckin' every other blessin'
I could never see the message, I could--
I could never take the lead, never bob and weave
Negative letting them annihilate me
Evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my--
Money in the ceiling lay my body in the street
Glory to the feeling of the holy unseen
Glory to the feeling of the holy unseen
Seen enough, make everybody scream, "I love myself!"

[Original Outro]
I lost my head
I must've misread what the good book said
Oh woes keep me, it's a jungle inside
Give myself again 'til the well runs dry

[Interlude]
Ah man, ay, ay homie, I told you it's a straight up Compton thing, ya dig what I'm talkin' bout? And this here is dedicated to the homies. Y'all feel what I'm saying? And sometimes I just get beside myself. The return of the Enoch is back, you hear what I'm talkin' bout?

[Verse 4]
Uh, I've been lookin' for you my whole life, appetite
For this feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
In a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Something's got me losing my mind
Where you at? From the front to the back
I'm lookin' for you, I react only when you react
I thought I found you back in the ghetto
When I was 17 with the .38 Special
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me, I'm suicidal any day
I could be your advocate
I could speak for you if you tell me what the matter is
I could preach for you with the mighty tongue
I'm the one, how can I, overcome
Negative energy while I give infinitely and survive?!

[Verse 1]
Comin' home when your Daddy go to work
Three phones and my pagers go berzerk
I'm talkin' birds like Dooney and Bourke
I'm talkin' work, enough to make you a clerk
Rubber bands, hard plates (what else?) big spoons
That whip got the plug out in mid June
Early July, I'm early like the bird that fly
Even Martin got a piece of that pie
I Eddie Murphy laugh at nigga, throw that piece in the sky
Drop the top on the Mercy, and bench streets with my tires
Make it dance like Percy, kids they on the sidewalk
Used to stash weed in my momma's Buick Skylark
I talk only full prices, negotiation
Rumination, fuck the police station
And if you got any association, then murder all close relation
Street life

[Verse 2]
Grocery bags on the counter, no grocery store
Couldn't fit a half a mil in the Gucci tote
Hit the lights, watch the roaches say "good night"
Stomp twice, say goodbye to the mice
Cook nice with a little bit of slice
And watch them dope fiends put that fire to that ice
Surely that dog's tail wag, it will bite
Man I'm just trynna get my scratch on these lice
When I was young, I had a flag on my bike
And then I went and got them mags on my bike
Momma don't wait up for me, I lost a bundle runnin' from the cops
Gotta get that makeup money, hey
I say I gotta get Nae-Nae lunch money
I say I gotta get Nae-Nae lunch money
It's Hollygrove till they bury me cold
Who's to say if they gon' bury me old?
I live that street life

[Verse 3]
Back to the struggle, born trouble
Like trynna find strength in a torn muscle
Young as scum, Daddy gone
But youngin' run the streets till he pull the gun
Pull they arm, all-all black hoodie on
Talibon strapped with the gat like a bomb
Red storm, handkerchief head on
Fuck around and them bees swarm, be calm
Better know what street you on
Don't you come on Eagle, are you Evel Knievel?
Crackheads got pipes and pistols
Now run up on that crackhead and fight the pistol
This is the street, nigga eat
Where the birds don't tweet, the birds go cheap
And niggas don't sleep, you may have heard of MLK
But I know a gang of niggas with they own street
Street life

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Old money, new work
Lil coke on my gums like my tooth hurt
They from the red clay, I'm from that brown durt
I love my baby mama, and Grandaddy Purp
New shirt, new jeans
New Bent' cost a nigga two Beams
That's two hundred thousand
Nigga you don't know nothin' bout it
Got real niggas ridin', fuck around we bustin' out it
It's Weezy bitch, yeah it's Weezy ho
Ray Charles mama, I don't even see the dough
Show me the money, show me the dough
I'm low, I'm C.E.O
Got stacks on deck, got hard, got wet
A bad bitch with me, I'm hard, she wet
Got raw, got white, got weed, got syrup
Work!

[Hook: Shawty Lo]
Bitch I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend
Bitch I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
Bitch I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend

[Verse 2: Shawty Lo]
The cars, the hoes, the life I chose
The ice is froze, my flow is cold
I'm hot for sho', you know it's Low
I been getting money way back in '94
The base, my trap, and you know it be on fire
D4L ain't gettin' money? That's a motherfuckin' lie
I already got money, can't you look at me dummy?
I'm laced head to toe, look at the way your ho chosed
Bank roll unfold, I made it rain on them hoes
'04 four-door double-o on them hoes
Bubble kush I blow, leave the smell on your clothes
I'm gettin' money in the hood and they already know
Whoa!

[Hook: Shawty Lo]
Bitch I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend
Bitch I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
I, I, I'm the man
Bitch I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend
Got no wife but the white be my girlfriend

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
She is so sick, and I would love to be her patient
And I will work every day as long as she's my occupation
Be, be, don't you wanna be
Be my secretary, she's my secretary
He's just secondary, we do what we wanna
He don't have the slightest
He thinks she's the nicest
I think she's so nasty
We do it so often
It seems like a job now
Like a nine to five now

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Don't you wanna be (don't you wanna be)
Be my secretary (be my secretary)
Come and work for me (come and work for me)
Whatever's necessary (whatever's necessary)

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
She's my employee of the month
Because of her I never learned how to role a blunt
She do everything for me, roll magazine for me
Shawty act like she gotta run away from him for me
Wayne, lemme quit talkin' and watch where I'm walkin'
I don't wanna step on toes, 'cause her homey gettin' angry
Overtime at the job is keepin' his girl from home
Nine to five or regular hours, but her shift's six to ten
She goes home at ten to be happy with her man
Till I need her too clock back in

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
You can check her resume and see what you will find
She has never missed a day and she has always been on time
When he's not in, that's when she clocks in
And if the bible says it's wrong, God don't forgive us for our sins

[Hook: Lil Wayne]

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Weezy F, motherfuckin' Baby

[Verse 2]
Hey, I'm on that fuckin' Patrón

[Intro: Lil Wayne & Lenny Williams]
Let's talk it over now
Ahem
Let's talk it over now
Hey, princess
Yeah, you
Oh, baby
Streetrunner
Um...

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Knew I would love you like a fat kid love food
Knew I would score like Shaq did in school
Knew I was stupid, knew I looked like a big fool
I must have had the flu, I thought that shit was cool
Knew you would fall in love with me and the shit I do
But never knew you would murder me—what did I do?
Knew you was right for me, knew I was right for you
Knew I would help you sell, knew I would write for you
Knew I would keep you well, knew I would fight for you
Knew I would pull out my heart and bring it right to you
You knew all about me, baby
But you wasn't about me, baby, damn...
Young Wayne, prepare for change
'Cause it seems like girlie don't care the same
You had my chain, you beared my name
Then, we had champagne

[Hook: Lenny Williams]
Let's drink a toast
To you and me
Let's drink a toast to our love
And the way it's supposed to be, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Other people telling me I fell off
Other people telling me; I felt y'all
Mama tellin' me I should at least call
My mind tellin' me, "She should at least call"
Felt like I was at the bottom of the seesaw
Felt like I was at the bottom of the seashore
But you got to let her be, boy
And when you open up your eyes, I hope you see more
And when I see you, I see detours
Don't need to be depressed anymore
Baby girl, I need more
Now, run your mouth 'til your knees sore

[Bridge: Lenny Williams]
Let's talk it over, let's talk it over, let's talk it over now
Let's talk it over, let's talk it over, let's talk it over now
Let's talk it over, let's talk it over, let's talk it over now

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Ugh, five karats on her finger, got her hand smitten
But everybody get a ring, even Scottie Pippen
Everybody got a thing, but I guess mine isn't
What my vision
So I just sits in my Lamborghini, let my top vibe with me
Kick back and get high with me, chyeah
And if she still get me
I hope my wife know she got a playa for life
And that's no bullshitting, heh
I push love to its full limits
Do a hundred-ninety in the lane called "Memory"
And I know you in that lane with me
But when the light change, you didn't change with it
And now, I'm honking my horn
Got to get that dead grass off of my lawn
As I mose' on
The champagne's never froz-on, as it pours on the floor

[Hook: Lenny Williams]
Let's drink a toast
To you and me
Let's drink a toast to our love
And the way it's supposed to be, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, C3 baby
Young Weezy and Young Curren$y, you understand me?

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Di-diamonds and girls, di-diamonds and girls
Di-diamonds and girls, di-diamonds and— diamonds
Di-diamonds and girls, and girls
And girls, di-diamonds and—

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Get 'em! Ugh, like five, six chains on
Slick Rick, no patch, just frames on
Marc Jacobs Aviators and a V-neck
Ten bitches, ten pistols on the P-jet
In a drop top Madina with the top up
I'm in that bitch getting neck like a shot put
Hundred thousand for the grill, if I lie, I die
Flow sick, so sick, see the cyanide
And here's my most funniest joke
I'm broke (Hahahaha)
Don't worry 'bout me, the money got me
And I keep the burner on me like an ID
The Lamborghini orange like vitamin C
And leave a bitch stuck like a kite in a tree
Weezy F.B., the money is the matter
I'm working like a bad bladder, M.O.B

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Di-diamonds and girls, di-diamonds and girls
Di-diamonds and girls, di-diamonds and— diamonds
Di-diamonds and girls, and girls
And girls, di-diamonds and—

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Yeah, hailing from the bottom of the map
But standing at the top of the game
Kush got a nigga looking like I could really use a nap
But I'm still out wildin' with the gang
Got diamonds in my chain, more colors than the Northern Lights
Life is a traffic jam but I'm on a motor bike
Zig-zagging past these bastards, laughing at 'em
I got them suicidal like the doors on the Phantom
Yeah, Hot Spitta nigga, who you thought it was?
Bitches want to hold me in the morning like a coffee mug
I don't try to lock them down cause I am not an officer
I just knock them down in groups of ten
As if I'm in the lane aiming for bowling pins
Then the style switch so quick
Have you thinking that the disc skipped, pimping serious
Make them bring it back like pass interference, yeah

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Di-diamonds and girls, di-diamonds and girls
Di-diamonds and girls, di-diamonds and— diamonds
Di-diamonds and girls, and girls

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Chea, speed boat, wife-beater
Ballin' like Derek Jeter for every reason
That Testarossa can get ghost like it never seen ya
The same color as sesame-a, diarrhea
The pioneer, I am here, right here
The watch nasty like gonorrhea
Money long like Nia, I appear via satellite
Whomever don't like the premiere, he a hermaphrodite
Vegetables up in my ear, get it clear
Pretty women want this nigga right here like Richard Gere
I switch the gear, and steer and disappear
And if I ever jump off a pier, I would probably fly

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Di-diamonds and girls, di-diamonds and girls
Di-diamonds and girls, di-diamonds and— diamonds
Di-diamonds and girls, and girls
And girls, di-diamonds and—
Di-diamonds and girls, di-diamonds and girls
Di-diamonds and girls, di-diamonds and— diamonds
Di-diamonds and girls, and girls

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I sit here alone everyday
Everyday at my window, my living room window
Thinkin' 'bout you
I watch the kids as they play
What happened to Nintendo? Where did it go?
No time for video games, no time for SEGA
Oh no, but I'm in space
I don't know if it is this girl face
Or how she taste, but I like it

[Bridge: Lil Wayne] (x2)
(Good God)
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what I got myself into

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
But I like it, ooh I like it
When you doin' it, how I like it
So keep doin' it, how I like it
Cause I like it, ooh I like it

[Verse 2: Boo]
I like sex in the mornin', I like sex at night
I like sex on the weekends, is that alright?
Alright, alright, all night, alright?
Come on, I got shampoo chilled
Took off her dress but kept on the heels
Damn baby, you so exotic
Holler my name loud when I'm inside it
No shame, I ate her pride
Tickled the pearl tongue and came up smilin'
Two dips a dip, and now we ridin'
Bed to the sink, sink to the shower
Back to the sink, back to the bed
It's 3:45, now I'm gettin' some head

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I get cold, I get goosebumps
And I head out the door, that's similar to her name
I'm so cold, but with her, all alone
I'm so high, I'm nearly hittin' the flame
She told me her name is Crazy
And I said "Hi, they call me Insane"
Crazy and Insane is so high up in the tree
F.U.C.K.I.N.G

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know what I will do
I guess I, I guess I, would just die
Go to Heaven and wait on you

[Verse 4: Mack Maine]
Ooh, I think I like you
If you was a poem, I would recite you
The bed could be our ring, I wanna fight you
Put my key in your ignition, let me ignite you
The cops keep comin', the cops keep comin'
To my front door like I'm trynna do somethin'
They don't understand that I'm involved with a woman
That love to make noise when she feel it in her stomach
I'mma have to talk to the neighbors
Matter of fact, let me take a walk by the neighbors
I don't know what the hell wrong with the neighbors
And what they expect when an animal is matin'
Knock on the door, like chicky-chicky-check it
Life is a party, don't ricky-ricky-wreck it
Y'all will call the cops and report a domestic
When I'm just trynna kill a problem called erection
Head in the coupe, call it sex on wheels
I'm a big dude, I treat sex like meals
She ride me for breakfast, I'm on top for lunch
And behind her for dinner, for dessert she say "yum"

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
I sit here alone everyday
Everyday, everyday in living room window
I watch the kids as they play
What happened to Nintendo?
No time for video games, no sir
No time, no time for SEGA
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what I got myself into
But I like her, I like her, I like her
And if she leave, I don't know what I'll do
I do know, I'd go to Heaven
And darlin' I'mma wait on you

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
I like it (Say what?)
I like it (Say what?)
(Say what?)
Yeah, baby
She likes it
She likes it
She likes it
I'm a R.O.C.K.S.T.A.R
Young Mula, baby
She likes it
And she likes it
Cause I do me, how she likes it
I'mma do me, how she likes it
She know I do her, how she likes it
I'mma make a movie
I'mma make a movie
I'mma make a movie
I'mma make a love
I'mma make a love movie
I'mma make a movie

[Intro]
Prada jeans... 300 dollars
Gucci slippers... 500 dollars
Spending all your money to make these white folks rich... Priceless

[Hook: Wyclef Jean]
They said opposites attract, so here I am
With my pistol in my pocket, hidden right under my jacket
They said opposites attract, so here she is
With a Masters and a Bachelor, she just became a doctor
Operate on me, I need that open heart surgery
Cause the way my heart is feelin', I can't make it through the night
Operate on me, I need that open heart surgery
Cause the way my heart is feelin', I can't make it through the night

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Pocket full of money and some dark shades
Flow so current, he can start waves
Game like butter, he Parkays
Love me some head like chardays
Coppin' quarters like the arcade
Get high with my animals in our cage
And you can see us if you star gaze
Creole boy, baby I sautees
On your mark, ready, start race
That's just you makin' my heart race
And I may be the opposite, but I'mma let you operate

[Hook: Wyclef Jean]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
And I know she want a D-boy
So I'mma pop up on her like 

[?]
I got that magic, like Bruce Leroy
And if this isn't it, then love has a decoy
Her body sicker than a retard
And I bet I got the medicine she need for it
And i bet I got the medicine to keep goin'
She shoots me with happiness, and I bleed joy
No Band-Aid for me boy
A loss of blood, yeah the girl got me weak boy
Yeah, I see you, and I see you
When I see you, girl, you're the one, can I be two?
And if your love is clear, then I see through
Then they yell "clear," and I pull through
You saved my life, baby I would too
And they say...

[Hook: Wyclef Jean]

[Verse 1]
My grills are so neat
Drip icy cold
Got offshore bank accounts and diamond blue palm trees
My platinum troubles are drowning in pink champagne
Escape into the sky in my own private jet
That's what I dream of in my head

[Chorus]
Gold coins everywhere
Dollars up in the air
It's a billionaire's love affair
Gold coins out the window
Money pours like the rain falls
And I'm spending like I don't care

[Verse 2]
Richlist and Bentley's
That's how I roll
These rock stars buy me pearls topped off with rubies rare
I stack it so high
Build a pretty green castle wall
I'll hide inside my fortress, smoking in my bed
That's what I dream of in my head

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Gold coins everywhere
Dollars up in the air
It's a billionaire's love affair

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Sleep my darling
I don't wanna wake you
I'll see you again

[Chorus]
Sleep my dear
I hope you're dreaming sweetly
But I'll be gone before you wake up

[Verse 2]
I won't talk much
Won't try to make it better
I think I did enough
I won't leave my trail, you'll never find me
You'll be lost behind me

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Sleep my dear
I hope you're dreaming sweetly
But I'll be gone before you wake up
Before you wake up

[Intro]
Hop in the car and go with me
You don't have to pack everything
Don't you wanna feel the breeze?
And forget everything, baby
Hop in the car and go with me
You don't have to pack everything
Don't you wanna feel the breeze?
And forget everything, baby

[Verse 1]
Got laid off at your job today
You've been working at this place for years
And though you were underpaid
Mami, that place isn't worth your tears
(Oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
I know that life is hard on you
And you can't seem to find out why
I'll explain, just grab your coat, girl
And just join me on this ride

[Chorus]
Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away-ay
We can spend the night, till the morning light
Let's just get away-ay

[Verse 3]
Girl, you're the best
You could be
An angel among society
But you get crushed
From what you see
You try to hard to help and that's enough for me (Woo, woo)

[Pre-Chorus]
Try to change what you can
And accept all the things that you cannot
(Don't stress yourself, baby)
I know you wanna fly away from the world
But for now with the time we've got

[Chorus]
Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away-ay
We can spend the night, till the morning light
Let's just get away-ay
Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away-ay (Let's just get away)
We can spend the night, till the morning light
Let's just get away-ay (Let's just get away)

[Bridge]
Maybe if you consider us just riding
That once you feel like a winner
No more crying
And baby, I know just what you need (I know)
To let your hair down so that you feel free, yeah
(Hair, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It hurts me to watch you sing the blues (It hurts me, baby)
Girl, you're so confused (Let's get away)
And I know what to do

[Chorus]
Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away (Let's just get away)
(Let's go, girl)
We can spend the night, till the morning light (Night)
Let's just get away-ay (Let's just get away)
Let's take a ride
Hop in the car and go with me
You don't have to pack everything
Don't you wanna feel the breeze?
And forget everything, baby (Let's take a ride)
Hop in the car and go with me
You don't have to pack everything
Don't you wanna feel the breeze?
And forget everything, baby

[Outro]
Let's take a ride
Let's go, girl
Let's go, girl
Let's go, girl
Let's go, girl

[Verse 1]
Would have given up my life for you
Guess it's true what they say about love
It's blind
Girl, you lied straight to my face
Looking in my eyes
And I believed you 'cause I loved you more than life
And all you had to do
Was apologize

[Chorus]
You didn't say you're sorry
I don't understand
You don't care that you hurt me
And now I'm half the man
That I used to be, when it was you and me
You didn't love me enough
My heart may never mend
And you'll never get to love me, again

[Post-Chorus]
No, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 2]
Sadness has me at the end of the line
Helpless watched you break this heart of mine
And loneliness only wants you back here with me
Common sense knows that you're not good enough for me
And all you had to do
Was apologize, and mean it

[Chorus]
But you didn't say you're sorry
I don't understand
You don't care that you hurt me
And now I'm half the man
That I used to be when it was you and me
You didn't love me enough
My heart may never mend
And you'll never get to love me

[Bridge]
I wish like hell I could go back in time
Maybe then I could see how
Forgiveness says that I should give you one more try
But it's too late, it's over now

[Chorus]
You didn't say you're sorry
I don't understand
You don't care that you hurt me
And now I'm half the man
That I used to be when it was you and me
You didn't love me enough
My heart may never mend
And you'll never get to love me
Again

[Outro]
Again, yeah, yeah
Again, again, again, yeah, yeah, yeah
Never get to love me

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Girl, I find you so amazing
With everyday, I learn more about you
The way you work day out and day in
And still find time for us too, yeah
I love the fact that you’re there for me when I feel down
No matter what I’m going through
Lately, I’ve been questioning myself
Am I good enough for you?

[Chorus]
Am I worthy of
Am I man enough
Am I strong enough
To maintain this love?
You’ve got me questioning (Yeah)
Got me wondering (Yeah, yeah)
Could I be that man?
That can keep you happy

[Verse 2]
I know that there’ll be times when I’ll be miles away
And you’ll be all alone
I constantly fight my insecurities
When I can’t reach you by phone
And, oh, Lord knows that I’m only human
So please forgive me if I ask so many silly questions
I know that you truly love me but
Fear has me second-guessing

[Chorus]
Am I worthy of
Am I man enough
Am I strong enough
To maintain this love?
You’ve got me questioning
Got me wondering
Could I be that man?
That can keep you happy

[Bridge]
Girl, excuse my ways (Excuse my ways)
I’m not trying to push your love away (Your love away)
It’s just that sometimes my imagination gets the best of me, yeah
I still love you, baby, everyday, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Am I worthy of
Am I man enough
Am I strong enough
To maintain this love? (To maintain this love)
You’ve got me questioning
Got me wondering (You got me thinking about myself)
Could I be that man (Am I good enough for you?)
That can keep you happy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Am I worthy of?
Am I man enough?
Am I strong enough (Strong enough, yeah)
To maintain this love? (To maintain this love)
You’ve got me questioning
Got me wondering (You got me wondering, yeah)
Could I be that man?
That can keep you happy

[Outro]
Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I wanna keep you happy

[Intro: Kid Ink]
Said I ain't even gotta say shit
You know who I'm talking to
Yeah, said I ain't even gotta say shit

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Baby, you know, that I cry all these tears for you
No one compares to the smile you make when
When I hit it, taste that kitty, I ain't even gotta say shit
10 girls in the back seat, nigga, I'm winnin'
She broke my heart, I guess she a superstar now
When all I really needed was your love

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kid Ink]
(Yeah)
She don't wanna love me no more (No more)
She said I was doing too much (Oh yeah)
And now I'm all alone with nobody ('Body)
I might as hell roll up
I'm tired of fighting (Fuck that)
Already been down that road (Yeah)
And she don't wanna love me no more (Fuck that)
She don't wanna love me no more (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
She don't wanna love me no more
All her shit parked front at the door
How the hell did we get here so damn fast?
Foot to the gas, tryin' cover your nose
Stop sniffin' around still ain't found nothin'
Actin' like Sherlock Holmes or somethin'
They say love don't cost a thing
But I can see change, girl, keep it one hunnid
If you really wanna leave
If you really wanna go, you gotta make it through me
I ain't doin' this alone
Think I'm goin' insane and it usually turns you on but right now

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kid Ink]
She don't wanna love me no more (No more)
She said I was doing too much (Uh)
And now I'm all alone with nobody ('Body)
I might as hell roll up
I'm tired of fighting (Fuck that)
Already been down that road (Yeah)
And she don't wanna love me no more (Fuck that)
She don't wanna love me no more

[Verse 1]
I'm so tired of good health
I'm so tired of this roof and my bed
I'm so tired of cooked food and good moods
And good coup with AC to cruise
So tired of myself, my word and my wealth
Too big is my heart, too small are my cares
Then she said...
I'm so tired of making love
I'm so tired of being kissed
I'm so tired of making money
I'm so tired of this kush in my spliff, it don't make sense
I'm so tired of my family, my friends
I'm so tired of one night stands
So tired of living lavish, two birds in one nest
And being notorious

[Hook]
Even when you're gone
I can still feel you
I want it more than air
And don't you care?
But that's not fair
The only thing you ever really loved
Was right there, right there, right there
Even when you're gone
I can still feel you
I want it more than air
And don't you care?
But that's not fair
The only thing you ever really loved
Was right there, right there, right there

[Verse 2]
I'm so tired of this scene
I'm so tired of this ocean, this breeze
So tired but can't close my eyes to find sleep
So tired of this dream (Reoccurring)
Your smile, your charm
Your patience, loyalty
Your love, ain't you tired of me?
To have it all, but not at all complete
Wanting you is all that ever drives my being
That never-ending, ever-tempting, tipping-over
All my energy, it's all that ever drives my being

[Hook]
Even when you're gone
I can still feel you
I want it more than air
And don't you care?
But that's not fair
The only thing you ever really loved
Was right there, right there, right there
Even when you're gone
I can still feel you
I want it more than air
And don't you care?
But that's not fair
The only thing you ever really loved
Was right there, right there, right there

[Intro]
I'd like to dedicate this song to little Junior Parker
A cousin of mine who's gone on, but we'd like to kinda carry on in his name
I sing

[Verse 1]
I don't know why I love you like I do
After all these changes that you put me through
You stole my money and my cigarettes
And I haven't seen hide nor hair of you yet

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know, won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

[Chorus]
Take me to the river and wash me down
Won't you cleanse my soul? Put my feet on the ground

[Verse 2]
I don't know why she treated me so bad
Look at all the things that we could have had
Love is a notion that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen I will never regret

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know, won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me, love me, please me, tease me
Till I can't, till I can't, can't take no more

[Chorus]
Take me to the river

[Verse 3]
I don't know why I love you like I do
After all the things that you put me through
The sixteen candles are burning on my wall
Turning me into the biggest fool of them all

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know, can't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

[Chorus]
I wanna know
Take me to the river
I wanna know
Want you to dip me in the water
I wanna know
Won't you wash me in the water?
Wash me in the water
Wash me in the water
Won't you wash me in the water?
Feeling good

[Verse]
I'm liable to start a violent spark with a silent thought
I disgust you like dialogue from The Shop to The Wired Frog
Night club, shit, I was taught
If your CD's on fire you had to put it out yourself like Highland Park
No fire department, so you might not hear sirens at all
But don't be alarmed if I sound off
Something just ain't right with me, dog
A martyr on a private charter, whose life could be harder?
Widely regarded highly? Bite me, sweetheart
I'm slightly retarded, but tonight I'm startin'
Shit, I'm feeling self righteous and might just hop in a mosh pit
On some Mike Tyson and Pac shit
Lookin' to box with anybody, disorderly conduct
I'll fuck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith
Fan of The LOX, bananas, manic, I'm going in shock
Frantic, I'm trapped in a closet
Panic attack 'cause I'm claustrophobic
No, faggot, I mean I can't maneuver for movement
'Cause I have no room for improvement
I'm practically squashed, compacted and boxed in
Toxic, cans of arsenic, flammable bars, examine the content
Bar exam, start of insanity
Charles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson
Animal snarls, cannibal jaws
Shark mandibles, lambs to the slaughter
Looking skantless as Hannibal's stalking
Anthony Hopkins with his hands in his pockets
(Whistle) Black out, Zach Galifianakis
Gallons of Vodka, but that gal has some knockers
I bet'cha they ring a bell when I come back and I'm conscious
What happened, doc? I passed out again
Alcohol's making me break into vacant's naked
Stolen Magnavox and bag of rocks in back of a Datsun
Fell asleep watching Fear Factor and Scare Tactics
Too close to the StairMaster
Poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it
Woke up shortly thereafter, hungover
No underwear, grasping a Bayer Aspirin and dropped it
Air Maxes in my closet, preposterous Nikes made out of ostrich
And the cross stitching is a cross mixing
Of a rhinoceros, possum skin, giraffe and a dolphin
Fin, cotton Dockers, OshKoshes, drop crotches
Swatch watches and sneakers match with the parkas
But it's like being overstaffed at a boxing gym
With all these trainers, but I don't have any boxers
And I'm standing here naked, hangover, still wasted
Like paper you write raps on, obnoxious
Yo, why does it always sound like I'm grabbing my nostrils?
Fuck that, I'll battle 'em all, I'll battle a mall
I’ll stand there and yell that at a wall
'Til the mannequin dolls scatter and the inanimate objects
That I'm battering all shatter and fall
'Cause I hear the track and I'm starting to get fucking amped
I'm a spark plug, I'm like the car with the cables
Hooked up to my fucking back, I'm a Duracell
But I sure as hell got it backwards 'cause y'all get jumped
And I'll catch the battery charge, but
I got a hunch like your back when it's arching
When I start attacking your squadron
You'll feel like MasterCard when I'm charging
So take a swipe at me, I'm coming straight at you
Like Clay Matthews from the Green Bay Packers
So get the sack like Wisconsin
That's nutbag that I'm talking, who am I kidding?
You faggots are all gonna do my bidding
Don't get dragged to the auction
Neiman Marcus, bags of Vuitton and all
I'll push a bitch into oncoming traffic, just watch this
Stretched, tinted, black sedan my ass
See how mad you act when I drop you off at Saks Fifth Ave
In a fucking taxi cab to go shopping
Affable guy next door's laughable
My next whore's gonna have mechanical arms
That'll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor
No emotion, hence I guess this sick prick dies hard
I got a Magic Johnson
It's like a Magic Wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me
If Ronda Rousey was on the couch with the condoms out
Holding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me
I laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me
Her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around
And all I see is Paulie Malignaggi, she Slaughterhouse in a blouse
And Madonna with mud on her, God dammit I am a misogynist
I slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster, throw her off a balcony
Just so happens she's fond of algae
'Cause now she faceplants on the concrete
Complete lack of responsibility
Half of you assholes ain't strong enough to pick up a spirit
Shit, you fags couldn't shoplift at a thrift shop
But I let the track lift 'em up, boost the energy
Klepto, I'm back to rip shop up, but my thing is this now
Five-finger discount
Been rapping so long I've been killing this shit, it's easy
Kidnapping your mom 'cause I'm still in this bitch, thievery
Ransom for JonBenét Ramsey, and Chandra Levy, and Gary Condit
("Em") Paul was scared that if I went back to the blonde
I might relapse, get on some bullshit
Perhaps I'll launch some cracker taunts at Action Bronson
Macklemore, Mac Miller and Asher Roth
And have some back and forths
And record a wack response to Kendrick Lamar's "Control" verse
And perform "Fack" in concert 

["Fack" plays]
Yo, I put that shit on a greatest hits album
Now that was awesome
It takes some massive balls to do some shit like that
Sometimes I have to ponder why people are like (I'll stick around)
And put up with my crap so long for, what's the attraction, mama?
Is it the fact that I'm a walking, talking, actual quadruple entendre
Or the pointy nose that's pointing at you, mama?
Who knows at this point, it's always poking so na-ah
Still get along with this voice 'cause that's the "Monster"
So do-si-do with the (na-ah) sociopath
Everyone who knows me knows that
What they don't know is the fact Rihanna calls me Pinocchio
(Na-ah) She loves the way I lie
Sits on my face and waits for my nose to grow
Pathological liar, oh, why am I such an asshole
That my disguise is pants, but they on fire
So am I-a, (Wu) Cappadonna, cut the track off
Sabotage Christmas, crap in your stocking
I'm wrapping up all the presents
In fucking camouflage so you can't even find 'em
Jack Santa Claus, snap Rudolph's antlers off
Wrap his schnoz in gauze bandage and blind him
Blowing a head gasket at Bed, Bath and Beyond
Put the basket back all the bath salt packets are gone, I
Know you really tired of me sampling Billy Squier
But classic rock acid rap is the genre
Got Slash on guitar, splash of Bizarre, Thrasher, and Aerosmith
And I'm a spectacular archer, feed Count Dracula Chocula
Godzilla, half dragon and Bob Dylan, bandwagoners
I'm kicking the damn stragglers off and I'm strangling 'em
Smack Kim Basinger on her ass in the sauna

[Intro: Kobe]
Just so you don't die alone

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I roll over and go to reach for you, you're gone
This bed's empty without you
You said you're moving on
But I'm having some trouble getting there
But dwelling ain't getting me, uhh, anywhere
Fuckin' Valentine's Day
Fuck February, stuffed teddy bear, guts everywhere
Machete on the floor, I smashed up every mirror
Yeah, how do I look?
You fuckin' just left me here to die didn't you?
Why didn't you respond yet?
I've written you five or six different times and
I'm gettin' sick and tired of always apologizing to you
I didn't do shit to deserve what you're puttin' me through
This couldn't be true, we can't be over
So violets are blue, roses are red
Why is it everything I do I'm reminded of you?

[Chorus: Kobe]
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart, she said, "Honey, I'm back"
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Guess I gotta deal with the fact that, you ain't never comin' back
Now every woman that I look at I'm lookin' for you
So I'm findin' something the matter with them
Excuse to not see anyone
Useless, rather pick up the phone, not at all, followin' protocol
I get bold like bowling balls
Grow balls and go to call to talk, forget what I want to say
Damnit I'm drawin' blanks like I'm playin' hangman
I'm sick of playin' these games, I can't handle this heartbreak
It's makin' me wanna blow out my brains
Like birthday cake candles
Hang up the phone and I shake, I think I may have made a mistake
Can't escape the madness
Turn the radio on, I hate this sad song
But I can't even change the station
The same one's playin' on eight channels
I lay awake in shambles, I'm startin to hallucinate
I'm havin' all these visions of us at each other's wakes
In caskets and suddenly I wake and that's when I know I

[Chorus: Kobe]
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart, she said, "Honey, I'm back"
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone

[Bridge: Kobe]
Give me one more, bottle for the pain
Give me one more for the memories
Give me one more, I'll make it taste like a steak
It'll help alleviate
It'll soothe this ache
Of trying to fake
That she's really, she's really coming back

[Verse 3: Eminem]
And it's been a while now, but I finally realize how
Much reality sucks, but it's just something about our love
I'm still in denial now, dealing with the finality of
And it's making me crazy thinking of the days we, spent
And how I'll never hold you again
And there ain't shit I can do about it
Now my head is overcrowded
With these clouded memories and I can't seem to get you out it
And how the fuck do you sleep comfortably
Knowing what you done did to me, huh?
Did it even occur to you that I loved you?
Completely, deep, and madly head over heels for you?
Was you and me, once used to be together forever
It was supposed to be us, but you crushed the dream
We was supposed to die together, and it's killing me so much
When I sleep I wake up dead, must be why I

[Chorus: Kobe]
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart, she said, "Honey, I'm back"
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone

[Verse 1]
Another day, another hotel, the inside of it is nice though, oh well
This is my life so as I go and try on clothes for tonight's show
To see how far that line goes, still blows my mind, show business
Guess I'll just never get, so this shit just always feels so weird
To this day because all's I ever did
Was just say the shit I would've wanted to hear
Other people say to me when I was a kid
So please don't make me some type of hero
'Cause I will say some ol' inspirational shit in a real way
But still will have a field day with some of the fucked up shit
In the world and tell it to suck on the dick, 'cause I still make fun
Of a sitch someone's in like a son of a bitch at another's expense
I'm fuckin' relentless as fuck when it comes to this pen
I struggle with coming to senses, stuck on the fence
It's a balance beam, if I seem unbalanced, it's challenging
When my conscience allows me to think the most foulest
Childish things without even blinking, without even thinkin' about
All the stinkin' amounts of people that seems to be reachin'
But the crowds, they're screaming
And The Palace sold out this evening
But now it's lay me down to sleep
And is it really my soul to keep, or have I sold it cheap?
Is it greed? And do I take more than I need?
When I joke of leavin', but keep overachievin'
'Cause what it's stole from me I've barely broken even

[Hook: Luis Resto]
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need

[Verse 2]
So a martyr is how I paint myself
And through my harrowin' ordeals I’m so vain I want my respect
But ignore the butterfly effect that comes from my dialect
'Til I sit in the dark and I reflect
And my reflection shows what it's like here
'Cause this vanity, surrounded by all these lights
Yeah, it's like a nightmare
I said, this vanity surrounded by these lights is a night mirror
And I don't like how I see myself, so I open the Bible to Isaiah
'Cause I swear to Christ there are nights when I stay up and might
Say a prayer twice just to make sure God hears
'Cause this ice layer I skate on's a nice way of putting it
But I like stayin' feistier than a triceratops and like a dice player
I got a nice paradise here, sealed off in my lair
Away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit from
And this house, is quite bare, but it ain't when you can't leave it
And I feel so isolated, it's nice I made it
But it's like I paid the price of fame twice, I hate it
So I bitch about my life then make another song
Vicious cycle ain't it, then wonder why I stay famous
I keep walkin' the line, this goldfish bowl gets old
But especially when you don’t know
If your conscience is sayin' I told you so
'Cause you don't even know anymore
If you got the soul of a soldier, or you sold your soul

[Hook: Luis Resto]
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need

[Bridge]
And from here you look so small
Hovering high above us all
Please come back to me

[Verse 3]
I still remember the times when
They were simpler than the rhymes of
Vanilla Ice were when I was just killin' the mics
I'll never forget what that feeling was like
I miss those times now when I was just starting out
Without a dime and now I'm diamond
I can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been
Stuck in this house hibernatin', hate even going outside
It sucks, sometimes I just wanna walk into Target and look at shit and browse, I don't even want to buy nothin'
I just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it
Look how excited I sound when I get to talkin' bout life and
Everything about it I miss, which now reminds me
Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz
Wow, I must have had Alzheimer's
Long time since I shouted them out, 'bout time
'Cause it's been on my mind lately how
Zee, you always supported me
You vouched, I will never forget that and
How you guys accepted me for me and Pace
I love you too, you slept on my couch
And I've been thinkin' 'bout the time
When I slept on the floor at The Outhouse
Rhyming's all we ever wanted to do
And regardless how life has turned out
Inside I'll, I'll always be an outsider
My life has been turned inside out but I—

[Hook: Luis Resto]
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need

[Outro]
But I keep walkin' the line...

[Verse 1]
I had a dream last night
You gave me a ring with a fucking castle on it
And a diamond on top, that's all I really wanted
Whoa-oh, whoa
Until two aliens came and chopped both our heads off
With samurai swords
At least we died together, that's what I thought
I woke up hugging leather, am I out of pocket?

[Pre-Chorus]
She ain't got no soul
She ain't got no heart
Love will stunt your growth
Love will make it hard to stay sober
So hard to stay sober

[Chorus]
I'ma be fine anyway
I'ma be cool
I'ma keep calm
I'ma be right anyway
Better than you, better than her
I'mma be on anyway
I'ma be on, on anyway, whoa
I'ma be on, on anyway

[Verse 2]
I been through like six Swishers
In one day with one grape and one blueberry
What would my mother say? She’d want me to be married
And happy and whole, not high and alone, whoa
That Xanax make you trip
I still ain't got no whip
I still ain't got no friends
At least I got my family
Bullshit, my daddy still can't stand me

[Pre-Chorus]
That hate don't make you hard
Hate'll make you old
Haters gone too far
Hate is all I know and I can't stay sober
I can't stay sober

[Chorus]
You should see the look on your face
I'ma be fine anyway
I'ma be cool
I'ma keep calm
I'ma be right anyway
Better than you, better than her
I'ma be on anyway
I'ma be on, on anyway, whoa
I'ma be on, on anyway

[Outro]
Just can't stay sober
I'm just trying to stay alive
I can't stay sober
I'm just trying to stay alive
I can't stay sober, I
Alive
I don't know man

[Verse 1]
I feel phenomenal as usual
Pharmaceuticals, glue sniffin', pools of vomit at Bonnaroo
But I don't know if I'm in Tennessee, Chicago, or Houston
In the corner tryin' to seek solitude
Shallow but such a hollow dude
I won't even swallow solid food
Alcoholic too, plus I'm on lean like the Tower of Pisa
Top it off I'm on mushrooms, so fuck all of you!
Roses are violet, mollies are blue
Lost in a ball of confusion, it's all an illusion
It's probably the shrooms I'm on
‘Cause I think I started hallucinating, ‘cause I just thought I heard Jay Electronica and Odd Future's new shit
And all I could do was follow the music
And end up with Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza
Fillin' water balloons with nail-polish remover
Just to pop 'em and wallow in fumes
I feel uptight, I gotta get looser
After I finish polishing off this bottle of booze I got a solution
Concentrated like orange juice, so I'm not as deluded
‘Cause all this delusion got me seein' shit
Excusez-moi, but that hoochie that passed
You see her ass? Wouldn't make her my main squeeze
Butt juicier, ass, it belongs in a juicer
It's mouth-waterin' too
So I walked over to her, like, “I’m Marshall
Wanna try to meet my standards? I'll introduce ya"
Oh, I'm a misogynist too, but I'm not a masseuse
But my attitude is rubbin' off on the youth, uh!
Chronic abuser, and I don't mean a user of marijuana
I mean verbal assault that I use to smoke all of you losers
Got a bazooka, a shotgun, a Ruger, a Glock, and a nuke
And a Rottweiler too, and I'm not in the mood, so
When I say I'm bringing the TEC out
I'm not coming to repair your fuckin' electronic computers
God, I'm gonna puke, I'm so gone off the hookah
I think I swallowed a loofah
I'm tore up, demolished, I'm fuckin' stoned like Oliver
Like I looked Medusa in the eyeball to seduce her
The thoughts I produce are loony tunes
The box of reusable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes
That were placed next to Veronica's boobs
And the paycheck stubs that were stuffed in the glove box
In a blue Honda with used condoms were clues
The girl was just not the one suitable for him

[Hook]
Right for me, (that will) change me
Rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me
Don’t laugh, please listen to me

[Verse 2]
Thought I’d give in to the pressure
Collapse and crumble perhaps, relapsing under that
Well, that's a bunch of crap
In the clutch, I'm the Captain Crunch of rap
And I'm sick of acting humble, that's enough of that
Fuck that shit, cut the sack
Like it's a natural reaction
That's why I'm actually trapped in this shoving match
‘Cause push keeps coming to that
I can keep getting my ass kicked and coming back
Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit, still mad
Disgruntled, had some struggles, yeah
But that passion and hunger's back
What a fantastic juggling act!
And the way I flip my tongue on the track
It's like verbal acrobatics, but in fact
Last time I tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic
I fuckin' crashed my hovercraft
After I strapped a duffel bag to my back
And stuffed a massive punchin' bag in it
And an elastic bungee strap, rubber, plaster, a thumb tack
And a piece of plastic bubble wrap
Went spastic and fuckin' snapped
Jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid
Stumbled back, recovered, back flipped
And landed on a gymnastic tumble mat
And for my last trick, lunge on back
Latch on a NASA shuttle flap, fuckin' snap the rudder in half
Chuckled and laughed, utter my last rebuttal
And just as I'm to come crashin'
I grab my Go-Go-Gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress and ceramic construction hat
Rub my magic mushroom tat
For luck, then splat, get up from that
Face taped to a waste paper basket
Throw up, then gasp, lungs collapsed
And that's more likely than finding someone that's…

[Hook]
Right for me, (that will) change me
Rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me
Don’t laugh, please listen to me

[Verse 3]
Couple of shots of Jäger
Public intoxication, dis-fuckin'-combobulation
Flooded with thoughts of anger
While I was away I know probably some of you got to thinkin'
"You're top ten, ain't cha?"
Stop it, you fuckers are talkin' crazy
And stop interrupting, you're not even up in that conversation
Whether you're punchin' a clock or famous
Underground, pop, or nameless
Whatever your job is, I give a fuck what's your occupation
You're thinkin' just ‘cause you came in with scrubs
And you brought the scalpel and sponge
The oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon
Stuck in the operating room
Once you done swapped your name with him
Smuggled in Ronald Reagan
If you dug him up; Donald Fagen
While juggling waffles, bacon
A fuckin' McDonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagled it
Flung it across the table
Then bump it and knock it shake it
Jumped and got in the way, then disrupted my concentration
I said fuck it and lost my patience
They all woke up from sedation
Ain't none of you Dr. Dre, so then what is it got you thinkin'
You can fuck with this operation?!
(Aftermath) Still running hip-hop amazin'
I'm still pluggin' along
No need for an assumption, here's confirmation
I'm up for the long duration
I'm just looking for something to walk away with
Some pocket change and a little integrity
Though I'll probably be jumpin' across the stage
'Til I'm fuckin' Madonna's age and
Stuck in an awkward place in my life
But I shit you not like I'm plugged up with constipation
That day will come
Before I finally stumble upon some lady that’s…

[Hook]
Right for me, (that will) change me
Rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me
Don’t laugh, please listen to me

[Chainsaw revving]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Got a shit-eating grin
Bitch, show me them itty-bitty titties again
We're in Sin City, since when did we begin to get dignity?
No diggity, bitch, you need to run and go get your figgity-friends
I'm lookin' at your bum-stiggity-bum, hun
The miggity mack's biggity back, don't act wiggity-wack
You can get the figgity-finger: the middle
You little dizzy bitch, sit and spiggaty-spin
Got a 6 o'clock cravin', stop, get Cîroc
It's 'bout to be an unbelievable night
I'll call it surreal, Sir Mix-a-Lot tape in
Hit the spot, spot my next victim
I'm picky like I missed a spot shavin'
Came to sip vodka, shit, yeah, that little chick is hot
But if she got rabies I wouldn't give the bitch a shot
I'd poke her in the rear, but I bet if I lick her, she'll try to chase me
(Ha ha!) What are you: pit, rott, mixed?
Oh, you just got fixed, well shit, then let's lip-lock
If not, then trick, piss off, you snobby little pig snot nose
You think you're hot shit 'cause you're in heat
Well, bitch, if you're solar, then I'm your polar opposite, dog
'Cause I'm colder than popsicle sticks, poppin' shit
Talkin' it, walkin' it, spit boxin'
My sick thoughts are 'bout to lick shots, like the shit's sobbin'
And drip-droppin' in chocolatey whip-toppin'
So whether you're hip-hop, Slipknot, B.I.G., Pac
Kid Rock, Kris Kross, Rick Ross
You'll dig this; if not, then kick rocks in flip flops!
And I produced the track
So you don't have to ask who it is when this shit knocks (Turn up!)
So crank the volume 'til it's bangin' and I'ma keep on sayin'
All the shit I should be hung for and probably killed for sayin'
And I probably will, but not until the day I pop a pill again
Like Joplin 'til I drop, and still
If that don’t do the job of killin' Shady, then the karma will
They sayin' I must bring it as Mohammad
Until the Parkinson's done ate away my brain
And made me Robin Williams crazy
Or I end up with dementia, but you rockin' with a sadist
Hate to say this, but if the thought is entertainin'
I ain't stoppin' til we explain it
Oh my god, for real, man, not again, I'm shakin'
But before I tie a rope around this nob
If they don't like it, got a knob that they can slob on until it's—
Wait, I just forgot what I was thinkin'…
What's it called again? I'm blankin'
The thing above the balls between my legs
And I think that I can feel it dangling, it's throbbing and it's veiny
Wait, I think that I got it, okay
Bitch, I got you, (Robin Williams hangin')
Bitch, don't hang in the lobby unless you came to slob me
Come on, kemosabe, it's past time like your favorite hobby
'Cause of the way that I spit she remains on my dick
Then she grab me by the nuts
And try to take my sausage as a hostage
Ain't it obvious? Pretty much a no-brainer
Or should I say Cobainer?
That she's plain addicted to my dick like Lorena Bobbitt
Gotta wean her off it, weiner off it
Like she took my fucking penis, chopped it
And stuck it up between her armpit
And she begun to swing a karambit knife and paint the carpet
At least that's what her train of thought is
'Cause I came, saw, conquered it
Hit it, quit it, and made her plain b-bonkers
And I always end up giving these bitches a complex
And I don't mean apartment
So spread your feet apart
And let me see you do some yoga stretches, splits
Now grab this Cuisinart
And make me breakfast, bitch, that's a prerequisite
And that's just to get in this bedroom, bitch
Walked up to that Ke$ha chick (what up?)
Said my name is Booger, wanna catch a flick?
I'll even let you pick, make her fetch a stick
Bet you if you give this old dog these new tricks
To get familiar with I learned extra quick
Kick a pregnant bitch, oops, I guess the shit
Took an unexpected twist like the neck of the freaking exorcist
Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-ch
Bitch, I said that this mask ain't for hockey
Hate Versace, Versace, I got Münchhausen by proxy
I'm making you sick, don't pretend you can't hear me
You deaf, girl, I said you was foxy
I'll tell a bitch like Bizarre
Bitch, shut the fuck up and get in my car!
And suck my fucking dick while I take a shit
And I think with my dick, so come blow my mind
And it tastes like humble pie, so swallow my pride
You're lucky just to follow my ride
If I let you run alongside the Humvee
Unless you're Nicki, grab you by the wrist, let's ski
So what's it gon' be? Put that shit away, Iggy
You gon' blow that rape whistle or me?
(Squee!) I love it, love it, love it
'Fore I get lost we're gettin' off
Like this is our exit, now let's hit the highway
And try not to get lost 'til we get to Las Vegas

[Bridge: Eminem]
(Party, do it 'til tomorrow, no sorrow)
Vegas
'Til we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'til tomorrow)
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'til tomorrow, no sorrow)
Vegas
'Til we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'til tomorrow)
Vegas

[Chorus: Eminem]
Whatever happens here, stays here
So let's go all the way dear
'Til we get to Las Vegas

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9]
Whatever happens in my room, it stays in my room
Like movie night like cable
Treat every women in my stable like flavors
Lick her like she kryptonite and I get weak after like seven days
And seven nights in the Days Inn, it's Hot Vegas
We roll in circles and packs—we the Life Savers
She got a boyfriend, I got a toy then
I'll bring it with me when I show up to her crib wavin'
And I ain't tryna meet a nice neighbor
I'm so Jay Electronic, I'm cut like I'm all out of razors
And all I got is a gun left with a bayonet on it
Neck so frozen it look like I walked in a jewelry store
With about a million dollars with your mama
And sat down and did an ALS challenge
Haaaan! I stole that adlib from French
Bad & Evil back at it again
About to get my back tatted again
About to get a pic of a backstabber with an axe in his hand
Sittin' on a bike in the sand
If you ain't been through nothin'
Then that shouldn't mean nothin' to you like likes on the 'Gram
If she current, I keep her pussy purrin' like the pipes on a Lamb
Weed got her so chinky-eyed
Look like she been gettin' high on a flight to Japan
I keep my jewelry on while I'm fuckin'
Sound like I'm shakin' up dice in a can
Listen, though this ain't Christmas
I make you my ex miss if this is my passion
I learn to give those who don't appreciate my presence
The gift of my absence
I don't know who you been listenin' to
Got me fucked up like Pookie in the chicken coop
Bitch, I don't give a two shits
(Bitch, get the fuck out of my face!)
To make a long story short, I don't really gotta stand there
And listen to you while you throw a silly tantrum
Even though I have an affinity for a witty banter
Startin' to feel like foulplay like Billy Laimbeer
Hold up, she misunderstood me, I said say, por favor
Thought I said the Wraith had four doors
I knock a nigga face off
Give him the bottom of the 9 like a baseball scoreboard (whatever)
I leave the club with my tab still open
Won't even get a cab for you and yo' friend
The only fear I have is of loathin'
And I won't even kick in 'til we get to Las Vegas

[Bridge: Eminem]
(Party, do it 'til tomorrow, no sorrow)
Vegas
'Til we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'til tomorrow)
(No sorrows)
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'til tomorrow, no sorrow)
Vegas
'Til we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'til tomorrow)
Vegas

[Chorus: Eminem]
Whatever happens here, stays here
So let's go all the way dear
'Til we get to Las Vegas

[Intro]
Yo, if you could just, for one minute
Or one split second in time, forget everything
Everything that bothers you
All your problems, everything, and follow me

[Verse 1]
If I was froze inside of a moment
If I could capture time inside a capsule, an hourglass full
Of sand in the palm of my hand, it passes through it
If I can grasp it and just control what happens to it
Then I can trap it, so no more time elapses through it
If raps could do it, maybe I could tap into it
Then I could try to channel it through Cadillacs and Buicks
To transmit through 'em, to make you put your ass into it
And that's when you hit the roof because you can't sit through it
Your passions too much for you to not be dancin' to it
And as you do it, your movements become fast and fluent
You're mashin' to it, moshin' 'til you're black and bluish
You're actin' foolish, this music it has influenced
You to be rowdy but in an orderly fashion, true it's
Chaotic but it's got your body movin' as a unit
Unitin' together tonight, so make it last and you better just—

[Hook]
Lose yourself in this music, this moment
We own it, we won't never let it go (go)
You better move yourself 'cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time to sit there and procrastinate (you better)
Lose yourself in this music, this moment
We own it, we won't never let it go (Go)
You better move yourself 'cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time to sit there and procrastinate
You better—

[Verse 2]
As we descend together, we begin to move as one
In perfect unison just like the moon and sun
Illuminate the room and humans soon become aluminum
Rhythmically in sync, if you'll excuse the pun
But if you could lose it once, I mean if you could let shit go
Relax, take a breath, and just let it exit slow
To rest your soul, you could leave the rest to me
If I could give the world a hit of ecstasy
To make 'em feel the feelin' that I'm feelin' right this minute
'Cause I feel like the night won't end until I get finished
So close the shades, makin' sure no light gets in it
The sky's the limit tonight because the night's infinite
A high percentage of black people and white mixed in it
But no one really gives a fuck 'cause they just like what's spinnin'
His life was spinnin', the whole entire night just spinnin'
Like life's beginning
To come out from inside your skin and quit hidin' in it

[Hook]
Lose yourself in this music, this moment
We own it, we won't never let it go (go)
You better move yourself 'cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time to sit there and procrastinate (you better)
Lose yourself in this music, this moment
We own it, we won't never let it go (Go)
You better move yourself 'cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time to sit there and procrastinate
You better—

[Chorus]
I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly

[Verse 1]
I had bright wishes in the summer, I was bathing in sunlight
Painting in the garden like a ghost in mid-July
Running fast from something with my eyes wide like
Saucers spinning in the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream that I was fine
I wasn't crazy, I was divine

[Chorus]
I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly

[Verse 2]
Your lies were hot kisses in the summer
I was dreaming of a lake
Dreaming of the water where I'd rise like a phoenix
Or an iron from the fire
I've got things to tell you like I know that you're a liar

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream that I was fine
I wasn't crazy, I was divine

[Chorus]
I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly

[Bridge]
Your words cut like a knife in butter
I was fighting for my art
Fighting with my lover, you had me so tied up
Thinking there's no other
Yeah, right
Yeah, right

[Chorus]
I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly

[Chorus]
With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

[Verse 1]
I saw you creeping around the garden; what are you hiding?
I beg your pardon, don't tell me "nothing"
I used to think that I could trust you
I was your woman
You were my knight and shining companion

[Pre-Chorus]
To my surprise
My love's demise
Was his own greed
And lullabies

[Chorus]
With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

[Verse 2]
I noticed you got hot in summer
You had no comfort
Your shirt was cotton
Your face was sunburned
You paced around like you'd been waiting
Waiting for something
Your world was burning and I stood watching

[Pre-Chorus]
As I looked on
The flames grew high
You watched me frown
I said "goodbye"

[Chorus]
With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

[Bridge]
Is it me, was I wrong to have trusted you?
Did I see what I wanted, what wasn't true?
Was I wrong to go on like a little fool?
It's amazing what women in love will do

[Chorus]
With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

[Verse]
Got a problem with the Golf? Fuck it, then pick a spot
Like you're eating lunch and it's brunch, we could bring the beef
And the pots and the pans, fuck it we could bring a lot
I just want to know if you can come and suck a dick or not?
Hit her up, pick her up in the front seat of my two seater vehicle
Hit the crib, grab the cuffs, take pictures of her butt
Where's your mouth open up?
I just want to know if you can come and suck a dick or what
The fuck am I yapping about? It don't matter
I'm the one, hun, T is the sun and you're Saturn
Better stop with all of the chit chatter, bitch I'm the tongue
I go dumblike the mental handicaps in the house
Y'all kiss butt like a nap on the couch
T the shit, I'm the weird little BLAH in your mouth
You better brush like Hova shoulder
Told you boys it never stop
I just want to know if you gon' come and suck a dick or not?
Pink and yellow in the fit, yeah
Ballin' now shit I wonder how I got here
Thanks to everyone whoever gave a fuck, yeah
A lot of niggas don’t know because I am, yeah
They told me to sit down, shit, I hate chairs
Fuck that instead I stood on their table
Flog Gnaw carnival, fuck ya' state fair
If you fuck with the Golf Boys nigga say yeah

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you fuck with the Golf Boys nigga say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Y'all niggas ain't fuckin' with T, man
Golf boys y'all ain't fuckin with me, man
Golf boys sorta like Stevie Wonder, niggas can’t see me
I’m the man nigga don’t trip unless you got your bags
Gotta say shit nigga fuck you and that's it nigga

[Intro]
Oh Oh Oh I, Oh Oh Oh I

[Verse 1]
If I wrote a book about were we stand
Then the title of my book would be "Life With Superman."
That's how you make me feel
I count you as a privilege
This love is so ideal
I'm honored to be in it
I know you feel the same
I see it everyday in all the things you do
In all the things you say

[Chorus]
You are my rock, baby you're the truth
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
You are my rock, you're everything i need
You are my rock, so baby rock with me
I wanna kiss you, feel you, please you just fine
I wanna touch you, love you, baby all night
Reward you for all the things you do.`
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you
Oh Oh Oh I

[Verse 2]
If I were to try to count the ways to make me smile
I'd run out of fingers before i run out of timeless
Things to talk about
Sugar you keeps it going on
Make me wanna keep my loving strong
Make me wanna try my best to give you what you want
And what you need
Give you my whole heart
Not just a little piece
More than a minimum, I'm talking everything
More than a single wish  I'm talking every dream

[Chorus]
You are my rock, baby you're the truth
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
You are my rock, you're everything i need
You are my rock, so baby rock with me
I wanna kiss you, feel you, please you just fine
I wanna touch you, love you, baby all night
Reward you for all the things you do.`
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you

[Bridge]
If there's options, i don't want them
They're not worth my time
Cause if it's not you, oh no thank you. I like us
Just fine. You're a rock in a sand, you're a smile in a
Cry, you're my joy through the pain, you're the truth
Through the lies. No matter what i do, i know that i can
Count on you

Oh Oh Oh I, Oh Oh Oh I

[Chorus]
You are my rock, baby you're the truth
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
You are my rock, you're everything i need
You are my rock, so baby rock with me
I wanna kiss you, feel you, please you just fine
I wanna touch you, love you, baby all night
Reward you for all the things you do.`
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you

Oh Oh Oh I, Oh Oh Oh I

I wanna kiss you, feel you, please you just fine
I wanna touch you, love you, baby all night
Reward you for all the things you do.`
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you
I wanna rock with you

[Verse 2]
////////////////

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights
When you sit and you think about Father
Or how you tried to be the perfect wife

[Pre-Chorus]
You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror, you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, "I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart"

[Chorus]
Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off

[Verse 2]
Mama (so sexy), you live and learn, that's just the way life goes
(Uh, you a killer, you a killer, killer)
Always know that you've got a daughter
That's so, so proud you took the high road
(You a killer, so sexy)

[Pre-Chorus]
You used to dress and fix your hair
You always smiled through your tears
In the mirror, you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, "I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish this didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart"

[Chorus]
And then you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off

[Bridge]
After all your tears
After all that pain's all clear
Mama, after all them years
We can start all over again
Mama, and now it all makes sense
Letting go is never the end
Mama, we can love again
This is where freedom begins

[Outro]
Mama, so put your love on top
You gon' shine and put your love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Everybody, put your love on top
Aye, love on top
Aye, love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Girl,you so fine, put your love on top

[Outro Skit: Tina Knowles]
If you're going through it, just know it's called "going THROUGH it"
You're not gonna get stuck there, you're not gonna die
You're gonna survive

[Verse 1]
Honey, the stars keep on calling my name
But don't worry, I've told you again and again
When I'm down, you're always the first one to know
Skipping town, I'll take you wherever I go

[Chorus]
And I just wanna go
I just wanna go

[Verse 2]
Honey, this town’s really taking it’s toll
But don’t worry, I’m all through with feeling this old
When I’m down, you’re always the first on my mind
Skipping town, let’s get out and see what we find

[Chorus]
And I just wanna go
I just wanna go

[Verse 1]
Honey, the stars keep on calling my name
But don't worry, I've told you again and again
When I'm down, you're always the first one to know
Skipping town, I'll take you wherever I go

[Chorus]
And I just wanna go
I just wanna go
I just wanna go
I just wanna go

[Spoken Outro]

[K]
Message to the gangstas
Ay man, it a lot of cats out here man
These cats imposters man, these cats impersonating ballers man, I'm telling you man
These nigga really broke out here on the low
You do not have to lie to kick it man, I swear man. Hey...

[Chorus: T.I.]
Ya lyin' bout that dough you say you got
You ain't fly
Wit them cloudy ass rocks in ya watch
You ain't fly
See, you imitatin' cats who really hot but
You ain't fly
Man, you niggas need to stop you know you barely getting by
You ain't fly

Ya lyin' bout that dough you say you getting'
You ain't fly
In you monkey suits, swearin that you pimpin'
You ain't fly
Seriously pimpin', stop your bullshitin'
You ain't fly
Out here flexin' for them bitches when you barely getting by

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I hate to see a nigga on some dummy shit
Talking big money shit
Livin' wit his mom, swear God that he runnin' shit
Hey listen, I ain't the one you wanna talk money wit
Cause I run through and look at you like, “Where the money at?”
You ought be ashamed of you chain, I'm makin' fun of that
Charm flickin' from time to time tryin to shine
My shit up under my shirt and you admirin' mine
Whoever told you that bullshit, will fly you a line
I got a watch wit no diamonds
Cost twice as much as that bullshit you wear when you call yourself shining
And your ring, “Boy stop it”
You need to take that neck bullshit chain and put them both in your pocket

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Ha, these niggas tickle me
“Why the gotta kick it like they rich, to me?”
I been doin' this since I was six, so this ain't shit to me
Man, I been fly since junior high and elementary
My uncles raised a G
But my daddy made a pimp of me
I never been a wannabe
I'm everything you wannabe
As long as bitches lookin
I'mma give 'em what they wanna see
Your outfit cost less than my underclothes
Ya ride ain't shit man, I put my bitch in one of those
My rides ridiculous, five and sixes
Had the Rolls Royce, til I decided to switch it
Now I'm in the Maybach
Notice mines extended
Feet kicked up, curtains closed, mind your business nigga

[Chorus x2]

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I got a half bird in my M2
Ya'll nigga flexing, ya'll nigga fool
Hundred k on her, hundred k on me
Got shiny shoes, got shiny jewels
Ain't nothing blue, they red clues
They at you, and they next too
They'll press you, they'll press you
They'll cock back, they depressed too
They'll press you, they'll press you
They'll cock back, they depressed too
They'll press you, they'll press you
They'll cock back, they depressed too

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
36
For a brick, too legit to quit
Michael Vick, all my dogs yeah they with the shit
Catch a point, shake him up like a hit stick
Your bitch is... on my dogs like a fucking tick
(Skrrt, skrrt) Straight up out that bowl with my fucking wrist
I ain't going to jail, so I gotta hit
Ain't shoot him in his ass, but I'mma bust his shit
I ain't 3hunna, but I'm Sosa bitch
My patna got the plug, he serve him everyday
Real ice inside my wrist, you can just skate away
Stay hot you think I live outside the equator bae
Don't play because them sticks sound like these 808s

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I got a half bird in my M2
Ya'll nigga flexing, ya'll nigga fool
Hundred k on her, hundred k on me
Got shiny shoes, got shiny jewels

They'll cock back, they depressed too
They'll press you, they'll press you
They'll cock back, they depressed too
They'll press you, they'll press you
They'll cock back, they depressed too

[Verse 2: OG Boo Dirty]
I'm flamed up, my block hot
Hundred bands in a shoebox
Still no gang, keep a Glock cocked
Spit more fire than a matchbox
Full cup of that Actavis
Yellow diamond like I'm dripping piss
Call me H-boogie, you know I move bricks
Thug right beside me, call him Money Mitch
I'm a Memphis nigga, hard on a bitch
All my life I been breaking tricks
With the mob squad I might spaz out
See too much cash I might crash out
Walk in the club, iced out
Neck and wrist, lighthouse
Ya'll know my life about
Rich nigga, walking stash house
Balling like Jerry Stackhouse
Bad bitch with me, hit the room and knock her back out
Crusing through the city, me and Double D
Just made a hundred thousand, selling pints of G

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I got a half bird in my M2
Ya'll nigga flexing, ya'll nigga fool
Hundred k on her, hundred k on me
Got shiny shoes, got shiny jewels
Ain't nothing blue, they red clues
They at you, and they next too
They'll press you, they'll press you
They'll cock back, they depressed too
They'll press you, they'll press you
They'll cock back, they depressed too
They'll press you, they'll press you
They'll cock back, they depressed too

[Verse 3: Heavy]
Everything I do, yeah I do it to make a profit
Me and Money Mitch got your bitch right here menage-ing
Me and Bo jug just to count them free dollars
(?) going crazy, love to shoot that damn chopper
He run the mob, bitch, BMG we taking off
Salute to real niggas who done made theyself a boss
He say that main bitch I just had her at the loft
Boss was on that molly, she was licking like a dog
Ay, that there irrelevant
I'mma paper chaser motherfuck a bitch
I'm cooling with my youngins on some hood shit
I'm so fuckin' hood, I need a hood bitch

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I got a half bird in my M2
Ya'll nigga flexing, ya'll nigga fool
Hundred k on her, hundred k on me
Got shiny shoes, got shiny jewels
Ain't nothing blue, they red clues
They at you, and they next too
They'll press you, they'll press you
They'll cock back, they depressed too
They'll press you, they'll press you
They'll cock back, they depressed too
They'll press you, they'll press you
They'll cock back, they depressed too
Aahhhh how I loved Mike. Truly. Deeply. He was the most sparkling man among us. Life will be different for us now. Earth will be a little duller. Mike Nichols is not alive.

The self is a creation. Mike created an extraordinary star — so bright, so extremely clever — himself. When you were with him, he brought you up to your best smart self, and kept it light with humor. To act for him on camera was to glide on a liquid film of intelligence. Before each scene, Mike gave his actors a brilliant and subversive insight. As you were stirred, he then got you with something really funny. In this state of transcendence, he walked away and said ‘roll camera.’ Now that he has truly ‘walked away’ the act of life is, for me, forever charmed.

[Verse 1: Sia]
I was bound, was tired
Hadn't seen a light so long
Thought I lost my fight
Couldn't find my way back home
And I found the light stepping out of me
I was bound, and tired
Waiting for daylight

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
Bang my head against the wall
Though I feel light headed, now I know I will not fall
I will rise above it all
Found what I was searching for
Though I feel light headed
I should have failed, and nailed the floor
Instead I rose above it all

[Chorus: Sia]
Oh, oh, oh
Bang my head against the wall
Oh, oh, oh
Instead I rose above it all
Bang my head against the wall

[Verse 2: Sia]
When you think of giving up
Just know, you might think you're dying but you won't
And you feel the love stepping out of you
But when you think of giving up, don't

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
Bang your head against the wall
Though you feel light headed, now you know you will not fall
You will rise above it all
Found what you was searching for
Though you feel light headed
You should have failed, and nailed the floor
Instead you rose above it all

[Chorus: Sia]
Oh, oh, oh
Bang my head against the wall
Oh, oh, oh
Instead I rose above it all
Bang my head against the wall

[Bridge: Sia]
I have broken wings
I keep trying, keep trying
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flying, oh I'm flying

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
Bang my head against the wall
Though I feel light headed, now I know I will not fall
I will rise above it all
Found what I was searching for
Though I feel light headed
I should have failed, and nailed the floor
Instead I rose above it all

[Chorus: Sia]
Oh, oh, oh
Bang my head against the wall
Oh, oh, oh
Bang my head against the wall
Oh, oh, oh
Bang my head against the wall
Oh, oh, oh
Instead I rose above it all

[Verse 1: Sia]
I was standing on the edge
I longed for a new beginning
But I couldn't look down, no, I couldn't look down
I'm a coward

[Verse 2: Sia]
A million voices screamed in my head
And I felt sure that I would give in
So why couldn't I now? Why couldn't I now?
Your voice was louder

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
By design, God gave me feelings
And by the design they shalt not kill
But when the noises overwhelm me
I feel sure that they will

[Chorus: Sia]
Oh liberation, comes in whatever form to save me
I hit bottom, and then the whisper comes
You whisper in the breeze
Whispers that I'm needing
Quiet words
Soothe the hurt
Whisperer

[Verse 3: Sia]
And though I struggle through the days now
It helps to know that you are listening
So I just wait it out
I'll wait this out, by the hour

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
By design, God gave me feelings
And by the design they shall not kill
But when the noises overwhelm me
I feel sure that they will

[Chorus: Sia]
Oh liberation, comes in whatever form to save me
I hit bottom, and then the whisper comes
You whisper in the breeze
Whispers that I'm needing
Quiet words
Soothe the hurt
Whisperer

[Verse 1]
Whoever thought a yungen' from a city full of rattle snakes
Was ever gon' make it out the grass patch
7 heels had me looking for a better deal
A hood nigga I couldn't count on the Nasdaq
Coming home from school, I had tears in my eyes
They was picking on me and wouldn't give me my hat back
Now I got enough hats to give away
It's better days, I refuse to have flashbacks
Nobody thought I knew what I was doing
Nobody believes so nobody would walk me through it
But nobody achieved what I achieved
If only somebody could have just seen what I seen
Said they praying for me, don't we all got needs
Til I walk in the room and they all just freeze
And they all look relieved like shit
If he made it now we all got cheese, nah
Homie that ain't the way it work
Especially if you ain't even put in a day of work
Now they going crazy cause I made it first
See homie I just made it work
It's a cold word, ask my old girl
She feel my pain and I ain't even tryin' to make it hurt
And my daddy proud of me
But he got too much pride to say it out loud for me
Got that keyboard off the road boarded in the house for me
He coming to my shows hanging in the crowd for me
Man I still love my niggs
The only thing that I ask is that they hold it down for me
I still rep the 850 yeah
I got it tatted on my arm, it ain't goin' nowhere
But motherfuckers will say that you changed
And they the ones that wouldn't last a day in this game
Don't get me wrong I ain't saying I stayed the same
But I guarantee that I will never succumb to the fame
That's some bullshit, and y'all know that ain't me
But I'd rather grow up than to stay eighteen
Life goes on and hopfully only great things
Travelling the world and seeing shit that I ain't seen
Then one day I look at my reflection
And realise how I been actin' and how I been dressing
I realise I can make an impression
But good Lord this is fuckin' depressin'
And good lord I got some fuckin' questions
I think it's time for some mo'fuckin' confessions

[Verse 2]
Wake up call, wake up call
My answer to every question was fuck y'all
All I need is this 9-11 to fuck broads
I just need to find a seven with enough flaws
My last album ain't do numbers like I wanted to
But that was God tryna ask me what I'm gonna do
He said "I hate to put obstacles right in front of you
But you gotta learn to get out of what you're goin' through"
Hurdles got jumped, mountains got climbed
Til' molly came and put a fuckin' wall up in my mind
Now I'm in the crib trippin', complainin' and bitchin'
That liquor got hittin I'm in here reminiscing
How many niggas told me I was gonna fail
Cause I got a list of niggas that can go to hell
They feel like I owe em something cause they know me well
Calling me a sellout cause I won't come back and smoke a L
The same nigga that told me I had a hit
Charged me 300 to put it up in his mix
Now suicide lookin' better than hittin' the lick
Cause the whole time they knew that I was livin' out my whip
But now I see em, and I can't even take a it
Cause he walk up to me ans say boy I knew you was gon' make it
And like Motherfucker do you not just recall?
I needed help and you just left me sittin' on my ballsâ
That just wasn't the right life
So I told a bullshit to have a nice life
And all them girls yellin' at me from in front of the moon
Like nigga how you just gonna go and get a white wife?
Fuck you bitches, I did what I did
Now I'm running round my mansion doing shit with my kids
But now maybe my life is too sweet
Like I woke up in that Bugatti and went right back to sleep
Deep, I was dreaming, y'all niggas was scheming
Like crabs up in the bucket but y'all just got to feed it
And all these bitches, all just want my semen
The star collecting checks and ball up in the season
But ain't nobody give a fuck when ain't nobody give a fuck
Now they got they hand out asking me to give it up
And everytime they ask me for something
They say "Now you know that I ain't never asked you for nothin'"
I got loss, I got loss
Credit cards got swiped, money got tossed
Hundred after hundred, dollar after dollar
Drinking every kind of liquor then that molly got swallowed
I know I fucked up cause I'm a grown man
So now I'm thinking like my old man
He said "You wanna make God laugh?
Then look up in the sky and try and come up with your own plan"
Now I see my niggas just want me to win
But I won't have em if I keep disrespecting my friends
They been through it, say they know the feel
So all I need is a trip up to Stoicville

[Intro: Pitbull]
Chris Brown, set it off (Woo!)

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Oh, feeling crazy
The moon is up, the night is hazy
Let's get lost in the shadows
Somewhere we can go where no one else can find

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull & Chris Brown]
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body, baby, come undone
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body, baby, come undone

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Pitbull]
Oh my my, looking like a good-good time
Don't disguise, the way you wanna love tonight
Oh my my, hook you with a brand new high
Don't be shy, I just wanna live tonight, have a little F.U.N., fun (Woo!)

[Verse 2: Pitbull & Chris Brown]
Fresh from Monaco, performin' for Microsoft
Miami to L.A., G4, we takin' off (Woo)
I'm a hard worker, I'm far from the boss
But when it's said and done, I'm ownin' it all (Oh)
I know you think it’s just rap (Huh, huh)
Just this, just that, haha, right (Huh)
Nah, baby, this my life
Wanna have fun for a night? Then just (Woo!)

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull & Chris Brown]
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body, baby, come undone
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body, baby, come undone

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Pitbull]
Oh my my, looking like good-good time
Don't disguise, the way you wanna love tonight
Oh my my, hook you with a brand new high
Don't be shy, I just wanna live tonight, have a little F.U.N., fun (Woo!)

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Go headlinin' on tour with Enrique
Often Casa Campo, who would've thought de que
Down in Key Largo, you know I'm on that sticky
Icky, icky, icky, icky
Don't do it much, but when I do, I'm gone
Don't take it all off, keep your heels and thong (Yeah)
Ah Mamì, that turns me on
Now just listen to the song, and (Woo!)

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull & Chris Brown]
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body, baby, come undone
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body, baby, come undone

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Oh my my, looking like good-good time
Don't disguise, the way you wanna love tonight
Oh my my, hook you with a brand new high
Don't be shy, I just wanna live tonight, have a little F.U.N., fun

[Bridge: Pitbull & Chris Brown]
Come on, Mami, you know what it is
Come on, baby, you know what it is
I wanna, uh, let's go to the crib
And if you want, you can bring your friends
Come on, Mami, you know what it is
Come on, baby, you know what it is
I wanna, uh, let's go to the crib
And if you want, you can bring your friends
And we can F.U.N., fun
Let's go, let's ride, let's show 'em how we do it in the 305

[Chorus: Pitbull, w/ Chris Brown]
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone (Now do it, baby)
Loosen up your body, baby, come undone
(What happens in Miami, never happens)
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body, baby, come undone (F.U.N., fun, haha)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Down on the floor
Back behind the door
I try to catch my breath again
I can't ignore
What's back behind the door
Wondering what's next again

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I can say that you're the one
That battles always choose
But sometimes I realize
That I'm the one confused

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I don't know what we're fighting for
Or why we have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how we got this way
I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit, tonight

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Memories consume, pacing in the room
Cleaning broken glass again
Suddenly soon you're leaving from the room
It's happening so fast again

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I can say that you're the one
That battles always choose
But sometimes I realize
That I'm the one confused

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I don't know what we're fighting for
Or why we have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how we got this way
I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit, tonight

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Crashing into walls
It never was your fault
So here we are again
And this is how it ends

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I don't know what we're fighting for
Or why we have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how we got this way
I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit, tonight

Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go
Now you can ride to this motherfucker
Bounce to this motherfucker
Freak to this motherfucker
(Let's get it on)
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor

[Verse 1: DMX]
Once again it's the darker nigga
Hit or spark a nigga, break apart a nigga
But the dog is bigger, under stress
So unless you're wantin' to bless to the chest
With slugs from the Smith & Wess, rest
Or the pump'll put a hurt on a nigga
Dump six motherfuckin' feet of dirt on a nigga
My hands stay dirty, 'cause I play dirty the mob way
You don't know, fuck it, find out the hard way
A nigga's job is never done, I handle my business how it come
And there's never been a one on one
There hasn't been a problem, I dissolve 'em like salt
Lock it up, hate to fall but never wreck his car
And it's my fault, keep niggas on point duckin' down
Niggas like you need to get bust, you fuckin' clown
I extort to support my peeps
And hold down the fort, never get caught, 'cause I creeps, nigga!

[Hook: Swizz Beatz (DMX)]
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go

Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor

[Verse 2: DMX]
I'm at the crossroads, look but I'm not really sure which way to go
Should I play that low for what I did the other day
They on their way to float, got me strikin' this random
I can't stand 'em, fake-ass niggas wantin' to be the Phantom
Lookin' over my shoulder, 'cause it's colder than it was
And start shorty, because I'm a little older than cuz
And the buzz from the saw, wit' the chain to your brain
Will turn that big nigga to a fuckin' stain
The pain from the dirt makes the hurt go away for a minute
But I'm gon die by it 'cause I'm like knee-deep in it
And you motherfuckers wonder why I start shit?
'Cause when you look in my face, you see that hard shit!
'Cause I done been to Hell and back I ain't wi't sellin' crack
I'd rather rob a nigga, leave him wit' a shell up in his back
On the real just to show proof, hit the GWB
And blow the whole roof off the toll booth, bitch ass nigga!

[Hook: Swizz Beatz (DMX)]
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go

Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Get it on the floor

[Verse 3: DMX]
When I crawl, leave a nigga sprawled out after I spoke 'em
I'll slit his throat, dick in the mud and let his blood choke 'em
Up north niggas get the pick stuck up in 'em
And in the streets bitches get the dick stuck up in 'em
My M.O. is man-slaughter kid
'Cause on the reals I done wet up more motherfuckers than water did
Slid, 'cause I got to slide when the dirt is done
A homicide but they want me on the Murder 1
But as long as I got my gun, I'm aight
Stay outta sight while it's light, and then come out at night
To make moves again, stomp and bruise again
I know I'm goin' to Hell, 'cause I choose to sin
All my motherfuckin' life I been the Devil's advocate
Now niggas never even knew the Devil had a kid
But he does; and when you hear the buzz of the chainsaw
You'll know why I'll split your motherfuckin' brains for!

[Hook: Swizz Beatz (DMX)]
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go

1. J.Cole first off I loved Born Sinner! My question is why did you create the website stream for the album before it even came out?

Cole - so fans didn't feel so bad for listening early2. What did your homie who was disappointed your first Dead Presidents freestyle think of the second one?

Cole - he was silenced forever. wasn't my homie, knew him through somebody else. but he's on Mute now3. If there was one thing you could've done differently music-wise, what would it have been?

Cole - sell Friday night lights4. What is one musician you love that most people would not expect you to listen to?

Cole - Eric Clapton5. Hearing that you're a big Outkast fan i'll ask you this; ATLiens or Aquemini?

Cole - DAMN. That's tough. But Aquemini6. Can you speak on your favorite track on Born Sinner?
Can you speak on your production process you took on Born Sinner?

Cole - First answer! Favorite song is too hard to decide. But I will say Runaway is definitely in the running. The verses!
Production process is an easier question to answer for me. I just let it FLOW. Normally I start out by finding drum sounds and patterns that make me move. for instance, Runaway started by flipping a real dirty drum loop, then adding a harder kick on top. Once i get drums that Move me and excite me, I look to add music (samples or something i'm playing) that make the marriage complete
Born sinner plays with a lot of Double time tempo's. Shit like power trip, that moves your head as if it's fast paced. but in reality, its technically a SLOW beat. The breakdown on LAnd of the Snakes another example. Or rich niggas
Thanks for the question7. What internet sites do you frequent, non-music related?

Cole - can i be honest? without getting killed off by Reddit community. I go to Digg a lot. I know Reddit ethered Digg a while ago, because of the amazing COMMUNITY experience of reddit. But I still rock with them
Don't taze me bro8. Why wasn't the beat that was used in the first Born Sinner uStream used on the album?
Cole - Didn't like the verses on it! they were hard but sometimes a beat is so good it's overpowering and intimidating. that beat is like that9. What did you have for lunch today?
Also, what's your favourite music video?
Yo i got another one, what's your favourite kind of booze?

Cole - haven't eaten yet today. you just reminded me that i need to eat10. Have you received any feedback (positive/negative) about your “Faggot” bars on Villuminati?

Cole - yes. i'm a communications major, studied PR. I knew what I was getting into. The comment I gave to Huffington Post was genuine and the reason why I wrote those bars. The line even makes me uncomfortable, but it's worth it for the sake of the conversation11.  What was the most meaningful song on Born Sinner?
To me it felt like you poured your heart out and went all in on this album. Love the work. Keep it coming, you're for real, man. Changing the game..

Cole - There is a lot of MEANING on the album. so most meaningful is hard. But I really love the title track "Born Sinner." Because even though there's lots of pitfalls, temptations, dangers, and tribulations on the album, it ends in a hopeful place with "i'm a born sinner, but i'll die BETTER than that" listen to those verses for more clarity. plus i touch on the things that are really important to me. relationship (got her life in my grip), family (she hate the way she raised me but she loved what she raised), friends (if i died today my nigga was it business, was it personal?)
Thank you12. Kid Cudi self-produced the whole album, Indicud, like you did on Born Sinner. What is you personal opinion on INDICUD?

Cole - I haven't heard INDICUD because I was working on my album. But I'm really mad at myself for not finishing a verse for that album in time. Got in the studio with Cudi and he was cool as shit. Good dude. I never did my verse and the joint was harddd13. One thing that I think everyone here wants to ask: Can you tell us anything new about your upcoming album with Kendrick Lamar? I really love Born Sinner by the way, can't wait to see where you go next, but I want to emphasize how good what you're doing right now is. And thanks for doing this AMA!

Cole - Thank you. This question will be asked a lot so I'll just answer it here. We have some really good songs in the stash, but haven't had a chance to properly work on a project. An album will come in the future, but probably not this year. I'm just happy for my niggaaa14. How did it feel when you heard Nas on Let Nas Down Remix?

Cole - Surreal. Today is my first day off in a LONG TIME (other than this. but this isn't WORK) I plan on soaking in that moment tonight and really reflecting on how amazing that is15. What made you want to work with James Fauntleroy? He is incredible

Cole - This is weird. You asked me a question. And then answered your own question16. did you have a fan base before you you got signed?

Cole - yes. i called them friends
That was it really. few hundred people had heard The Come Up, and School Daze was popping on my myspace page. No buzz though. Just skeelz17. Favorite nba team?

Cole - no real team loyalty. just follow players now. Looking for a home. my last favorite team was the KNICKS because Penny Hardaway's last real playing years were there (and i just happened to be in NYC for college). Before that it was the Magic, then the Suns. NEVER FAVORITE A TEAM BECAUSE OF A PLAYER, when he leaves you're gonna be lost in the world18. So....have you met Jay Electronica? How's he like?
Who's your favorite celebrity that you've met/would like to meet?
Cole - jay electronica has the most phone numbers out of anybody i ever met. He changes his number every 16 hours19. How did you celebrate the release of born sinner?
Cole world

Cole - got twisted tuesday night with friends and fam in NYC while feeling really grateful and relieved and blessed and happy20. COLE I HOOKED YOU UP WITH THAT GIANT BORN SINNER PIC BY YOUR NAME, PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE YA BOY'S EXISTENCE

Cole - acknowledged21. Congratulations on Nas's remix to your joint Cole!
Listening to your songs I often get chills. Songs such as God's Gift, Return of Simba, See it to Believe it and too many songs off of Born Sinner! Has there ever been a song you've heard whether it be from Nas or someone else that has blown your mind and influenced your style greatly?

Cole - Nas- Undying Love Eminem- Stan just mind blowing concepts tons more of course from more than just those rappers22. Why Did you try and compete with Kanye on the 18th? Wouldn't it make more sense to have your album release on a day with less competition?

Cole - Just followed my instincts. I was confident in the album I had. Didn't know what he had, but didn't care. Wanted to start the conversation. I've had a #1 album before. It's cool. But I wouldn't have been able to live with myself wondering "what if I would have moved my date?"23. Hi J. Cole. I have a few questions for you but first off I would like to say thank you for taking time out of your day to do an AMA here on HipHopHeads. I've been a big fan of yours ever since my friend at school introduced me to some of your songs last year. I really wanted to come to your Atlanta show a couple of days ago and support you and buy some merchandise but I found out that there was an age limit, and I am only 15
What are your favorite things to do outside of rapping?
What job would you like to have if you didn't rap?
What has been the hardest part of your rapping career so far?
Do you think of yourself as "famous" now that you have had two successful albums?
Are you going to be releasing any winter merchandise for Born Sinner? I would really like to have a hoody with the album art on it and wear it all around my campus
Thanks again for doing this AMA, I am looking foward to future album and mixtape releases

Cole - If I didn't rap I have no clue what I would want to do. Would take a lot of self re-evaluating to figure that out. Too much passion for music to think of something else right now
Hardest part of my rap career so far was finding the balance. How to become a mainstream artist without losing myself. Took a lot of experimenting, trying things, sometimes failing. But I found it
Born Sinner CROWN Hoodies on the way24. What did yourself and Drake do with all those copies of the album you bought?
What was your first feeling when the album leaked so far in advance?

Cole - I don't even know what happened to those copies. Hopefully they gave them out to the people
My first feeling when the album leaked 12 DAYS IN ADVANCE. was "oh fuck"25. Thank you for doing this AMA J. Cole, to see my favorite rapper come to my favorite online community is really something special
3 days before Sideline Story dropped I was at your concert in Tampa, and you shouted me out at the end while doing Farewell, I was the white kid wearing a Dreamville shirt, here's a picture of me from that night http://imgur.com/dtNJLZ1 When you have your next concert in Tampa, or the closest other venue, I plan on wearing a shirt that says "Produce with J. Cole or Die Trying" I would really just like to get some advice on producing, it's become something I love to do, and you are amazing at it
Anyways, my question for you is how does it feel to have your idol, Nas, rap over your own song, saying that he is proud of you?
Thank you once again, I've been a fan since The Warm Up, and your music has gotten me through some very hard times. Sorry for fan girling, but I've seen in interviews how you've talked about how much you liked Nas as a kid where it felt like you knew him, and that's exactly how I feel about you. Keep making amazing music, and thank you for helping bring back the real
Cole - thank you. i'm going to do a real tour in the fall
I answered the Nas question. Really just wanted to say thank you for listening. And I just heard we beat Edward Snowden for #1 on Reddit. AND I AIN'T HAVE TO BETRAY THE US GOVERNMENT!!! jk jk jk jk (does anyone still use jk.. felt like a 12 year old girl typing that)26. What are your favorite shows on TV? (More importantly, do you watch Breaking Bad?) lol

Cole - Newsroom is my favorite show. House of Cards too. Breaking Bad is incredible, I only saw the first 2 episodes and planned on watching every episode of every season to catch up. But never had time. So NO, I don't watch it but wish I could27. Hey Cole. Born sinner is easily the best album that came out on June 18th and your production and rapping was on point. I got two questions for you
1) Why did you decide to not have any guest features spit a verse on Born sinner?
2) When can we expect your collab album with Kendrick?
Thanks for doing this ama Cole!

Cole - Thank you! By the time I was wrapping up the album, I started doing interviews and getting questions about features. I didn't have any rap features, and I felt pressure to ADD some, but quickly realized that I had already said what I wanted to say on this album. The mentality was "who says you HAVE to have other people rapping on your album?"

2) Don't want to put a date on it28. If you could, would you have done Born Sinner differently?

Cole - nope

[Spoken]
I went through a pretty rough breakup recently. It was a long time coming, we had a lot of conversations about it, she and I. But recently, we've had the conversation. It wasn't recent, but I can remember it like it was yesterday. She came out of the shower, hair wet, everything was wet. If you haven't seen a shower: It's a thing with water, and it covers you, and she had just been in that. She came right out of it and she looked me in the eyes and she said:

[Girl]
It's over
We shouldn't fight to stay together just to fight again
It's over
We're unhappy
We need to take a break from us to make us right again
And even though it's not gonna go any further
I swear I don't regret a second of it
And when the dust has settled
I hope we can still be friends

[Bo]
And then I said
EAT A DICK!
EAT A DICK!
EAT A FUCKING DICK, BITCH!
PUT ON YOUR DICK EATING GLOVES
GET READY TO GOBBLE A DICK UP!
IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS DICK SITCH
EAT A FUCKING DICK, BITCH!

[Girl]
(Starting to think I made the right decision here)
Look, you're angry
I can see that
But you don't need to make this harder than it has to be
I try to speak to you
But you won't listen-

[Bo]
EAT A DICK!

[Girl]
Hold on, please just let me-

[Bo]
EAT A DICK!

[Girl]
Oh my God
Honestly, are you fucking five?
I try to talk this out, and you refuse to even listen to me
I'm saying how I'm feeling
And you're saying "eat a dick"
Does that seem like a mature response to you?

[Bo]
NO!
BUT SEE I THINK THE ISSUE IS
I'VE GOT MY FATHERS TEMPER
AND I'M EMOTIONALLY INARTICULATE!
SO RATHER THAN BEING HONEST AND VULNERABLE
I'VE BEEN A QUICK SWITCH
BECAUSE I'M HURTING INSIDE
AND I'M TRYING TO HIDE IT, SO
EAT A DICK, BITCH!
I thought we had a future together, you fucking whore

[Girl]
I didn't think you'd cry for me
I didn't think you cared
I thought you were lashing out in anger
Now I see you're scared
I'm scared, too
Maybe we can work this out
And not break up

[Bo]
Really?

[Girl]
NO, LICK MY CLIT!
LICK MY MOTHERFUCKING CLIT!
YOU THINK THREE LOUSY TEARS
OFFSETS THREE YEARS OF SHIT
I DESERVE BETTER THAN YOU
GET ME WETTER, THEN SCREW
SORRY, YOU'RE NOT WHAT I NEED, HUN
LICK THIS CLIT AND LEAVE, SON

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
Mama, I'm in love with a hot girl, and they just don't get it
They just don't get it
Temperature's risin', her body yearnin', yeah, we on that R. Kelly
And then she tell me

[Chorus: Christina Milian & Lil Wayne]
Let's start a fire, you'll be my lighter
Baby, I'll be your gasoline (And they just don't get it)
Let's start a fire, watch the entire
World, as it opens up in flames (And they just don't get it)
Let's start a fire (Yeah, Mickey and Mallory)
Let's start a fire (Yeah, Bonnie and Clyde, Thelma and Lil Weezy)
Let's start a fire
Let's start a fire-ire-ire

All we do is fuck all day, all mañana
It's a cold world, I stay warm inside her
Make her perspire, sweat, blood, and crying
Goodness gracious, great God almighty
She fuck me like a king, Stephen, Martin, Rodney
We break all of monotony, baby, we high commodity
And they just don't get it

Let's start a fire, you'll be my lighter
Baby, I'll be your gasoline (And they just don't get it)
Let's start a fire, watch the entire
World, as it opens up in flames (And they just don't get it)
Let's start a fire (Me and you)
Let's start a fire (And they just don't get it)
Let's start a fire

And then she tell me (Let's start a fire)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Like goodness gracious, great balls of fire
She ridin' me like a street car named Desire
Stop, drop, roll, and shake what her mama gave her
Clap that ass like the choir
Oh, I ran into my old thing
I say, "Bitch, you broke my heart, but that's just growin' pains"
But trust me, she ain't nothing but an old flame
And I threw water on that old flame, no more flames
I'm so glad I'm out the dope game
'Cause now I got more time to burn in that pussy like some propane
Now that pussy is my domain
And I know they just don't get it, they just don't get it, yeah

[Chorus: Christina Milian & Lil Wayne]
Let's start a fire, you'll be my lighter
Baby, I'll be your gasoline
Let's start a fire, watch the entire
World, as it opens up in flames (And they just don't get it)
Let's start a fire (Fuck 'em, fuck it, they just don't get it, see we already, we already lit it)
Let's start a fire (And now we on fire, we on fire, yeah, it's me and you)
Let's start a fire (Just don't get it, we already, we already did it)
Let's start a fire-ire-ire (And now we on fire, we on fire, yeah)

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Christina Milian]
Let's start a fire
Mama I'm in love with a hot girl, and they just don't get it
They just don't get it
Baby, I'll be your gasoline
Fuck it, 'cause Mama, I'm in love with a hot girl
And they just don't get it
Let's start a fire, watch the entire
World, as it opens up in flames
Fuck em', 'cause Mama, I'm in love with a hot girl
And they just don't get it
Young Mula baby

[Intro]
Uh, what's up, baby?
Come here, I wanna taste you
But I know you're gonna like it
So, are you ready?
I love the way your body feels next to mine
Listen, let me explain

[Verse 1]
Temperature's rising
And your body's yearning for me, oh, baby
Girl, lay it on me, I place no one above thee
Oh, take me to your ecstasy

[Chorus]
It seems like you're ready
Seems like you're ready (seems like you're ready)
Girl, are you ready to go all the way? All the way
It seems like you're ready (seems like you're ready)
Seems like you're ready
Girl, are you ready to go all the way? All the way

[Verse 2]
I can smell your perfume
Step into my bedroom, let me love you constantly (come here, baby)
Oh, oh, your body is my playground, let me lick you up and down
Make you feel like a woman should

[Chorus]
It seems like you're ready
Seems like you're ready (seems like you're ready)
Girl, are you ready to go all the way? Girl, all the way
It seems like you're ready (seems like you're ready)
Seems like you're ready
Girl, are you ready to go all the way? All the way

[Bridge]
Look in the mirror (oh oh...)
Now come a little bit closer
(Don't worry, don't you worry)
Don't be scared, I'm not gonna hurt you
I wanna do all of the things you want me to do to you
(All of the things you want)
And baby, I wanna make you feel real good while I'm doing it, woah

[Chorus]
It seems like you're ready
Seems like you're ready (seems like you're ready)
Girl, are you ready to go all the way? All the way
It seems like you're ready (seems like you're ready)
I could've sworn you were ready
Girl, are you ready to go all the way? All the way
It seems like you're ready (just like you're ready)
Girl, are you ready to go all the way? All the way

[Outro]
So are you ready? Woo! (Seems like you're ready)
For my loving, baby
Girl, are you ready
I'm gonna make you feel so good
But there's one thing I'd like to know is
Do you want it, baby? (Seems like you're ready)
Do you need it, baby? (Girl, are you ready?)
I'd like to know if I'm the one that you're preparing for
Tell me, baby; am I the one you want? (Seems like you're ready)
Listen, am I the one you need?
(Girl, are you ready?)
I just gotta know right now, right now
'Cause it seems just like you're ready (seems like you're ready)
Just like you're ready, baby (girl, are you ready?)
And I don't wanna make no mistakes at all
But it seems like you're ready, ha
Come here, baby; hey there, lady
I'm willing... (seems like you're ready)
...to bet my life that you're ready (girl, are you ready?)
And I promise I'll be good to you, baby
You don't have to worry, no, baby
No, baby, no no no no, baby...

[Verse 1: "Weird Al" Yankovic]
You're sort of famous, a minor celebrity
And so it only makes sense the world would be
Obsessed with every single thing you do
They're running 'round with their camcorders in the night
They're lurking patiently and hoping that they just might
See something real embarrassing you do

[Pre-Chorus: "Weird Al" Yankovic]
The bad hair day and sweat-stained t-shirt
That's the story that they're gonna feature
With exclusive pics of your flabby behind
You think you're all alone, but that's right when you'll find

[Chorus: "Weird Al" Yankovic]
A bunch of paparazzi popping out of nowhere
Cameras in your face, and then suddenly
You're on TMZ, you're on TMZ

[Verse 2: "Weird Al" Yankovic]
Following you when you're walking down the street
And asking stupid questions while you're trying to eat
So you cover your face, thinking to yourself
"Hey, isn't this creepy?"
And they're out there praying you'll have a big meltdown
And take 'em on a little car chase through this whole town
They'll be there with you when you're going to jail
First on the scene for every wardrobe fail

[Pre-Chorus: "Weird Al" Yankovic]
You just picked up some transvestite
Seconds later, it's up on the website
Get a Vegas wedding, a quickie divorce
And they'll be sneaking in, snapping pictures, of course

[Chorus: "Weird Al" Yankovic]
And if they ever catch you picking your nose
Or stumblin' down the street on a drunken spree
You're on TMZ
Stalking you, just waiting by your front door
Trailing you through airport security
They're with TMZ, they're with TMZ

[Skit: Tom Kenny]
"We caught this Oscar nominee picking up dog poop!"
"Is that a baby bump?"
"I pronounce you guilty… of leaving the house while fat!"
"Look who's drinking coffee!"
"Everything celebrities do is fascinating!"

[Bridge: "Weird Al" Yankovic]
Oh, let me tell you
It's getting to the point where a famous person can't
Even get a DUI or go on a racist rant
Those guys are all around, so you really shouldn't dare
Go to every club in town if you've lost your underwear

[Chorus: "Weird Al" Yankovic]
Seems that every single time a star decides to
Shave their head or ram their car into a tree
They're on TMZ
If they catch you peeing in the bushes
Later on that night, well, I guarantee
You're on TMZ, you're on TMZ

[Outro: "Weird Al" Yankovic]
You're on TMZ
Every single celebrity knows they're gonna be
There on TMZ

[Intro: Beyoncé]
I love your face
You love the taste
That sugar babe, it melts away

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I kiss you and you lick your lips, I kiss you and you lick your lips
You like it wet and so do I, you like it wet and so do I
I know you never waste a drip, I know you never waste a drip
I wonder how it feels sometimes
Must be good to you

Don't worry, it's nothing major
Make sure you clean that
It's the only way to get the
Flavor

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
If you're thirsty and in love, just hit your boy
I'm your milk man at your door
When you phone me, I can see you with your cup
I'm just role playing
(Must be good to you)

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me coming, keep me going
Keep me humming, keep me moaning, keep me humming, keep me moaning

[Interlude: Beyoncé]
I'm about to get into this, girls
This is for all the grown women out there

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I can't wait 'til I get home so you can tear that cherry out
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out
I can't wait 'til I get home so you can tear that cherry out

Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out
I want you to
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
Ooh, I've had a naughty thought today, baby
Every time I close my eyes
Ooh, get a glimpse of this candy paint
Don’t slip off when it drip off on top of your ride
When you see it here, lift it up then toss it babe
I know everything you want
I'ma show you how I stroke (Stroke it)
Bring ya work home on top of me
I'ma let you be the, be the boss of me
I know everything you want
Give me that daddy long stroke

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I can't wait 'til I get home so you can tear that cherry out
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out
I can't wait 'til I get home so you can tear that cherry out
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out
I want you to
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out
I want you to
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out
I want you to
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out
I want you to
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out

[Break]
Je ne sais quoi
Cherie, m'vle-ou
Aswe ya ce net al kole!

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me coming, keep me going
Keep me humming, keep me moaning, keep me humming, keep me moaning
Don't stop loving 'til the morning, don't stop loving 'til the morning
Don't stop screaming, freaking, blowing

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Can you eat my skittles?
It's the sweetest in the middle (Yeah)
Pink is the flavor
Solve the riddle (Yeah)

[Intro]
Yo, I got 12 things to say and 12 ways of saying it
So wait a minute, check it out check it out

[Verse 1]
Do you mind
If I give you some of my 12 play?
Do you mind, baby
Do you mind if I
Give you some of my 12 play?
Okay, here we go

[Chorus]
12 play, give 'em a little
12 play (just), a sample of it
12 play, just a little
12 play (do you mind if I give you some of my)
12 play, give 'em a little
12 play, a sample of it
12 play... (oh yes, here we go)

[Verse 2]
1, we'll go to my room of fun
2, then I'll say give me your tongue
3, 'cause tonight I'm gonna fulfill your fantasies, yes
4, lie down on the floor
5, cannot wait to come inside
6, anything that's broken, I'll fix
7, spread your legs apart
8, feel me, I'm so hard
9, see I want you from behind (slip the bump and grind yes)
10, baby climb on top of me
11, up and down we'll go you'll see
12, and that's when I'll go down on my knees
Giving you some of my

[Chorus]
12 play, give 'em a little (oh yes)
12 play (12 play), a sample of it (yeah yeah)
12 play (ooooh), just a little (just a little)
12 play (of my 12 play)
12 play, give 'em a little (give you, little, huh)
12 play (of my 12 play), a sample of it
12 play (see everything's gonna be alright, once I, give you some of my 12 play)
12 play, give 'em a little
12 play, a sample of it (hey hey, woo!)
12 play, just a little (is it alright, tell me baby?)
12 play (is it alright?)
12 play, give 'em a little (if I give you)
12 play, a sample of it (just a little bit of my 12 play)
12 play (12 play, 12 play, 12, heyyyyyyyyeaaaaaahhh)
12 play, give 'em a little
12 play, a sample of it (12, oww!)
12 play, just a little (just a little bit of my)
12 play (just an example baby of my 12, 12 play)
12 play, give 'em a little (ha, and you won't regret baby)
12 play, a sample of it (come on and let me drive you crazy)
12 play, I'll be stroking you up and down
Spinning you all around
Change your frown to a smile
Band, break it down (give 'em a little)
Ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, oh yes

[Outro]
Break it down
Oh.....
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh baby baby baby
Just a little 12 play, huh
Listen baby
Whether it's morning, noon, or night
I can make you feel alright, sing it
(12 play, just a little) yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
And once the lights go down
There'll be no fooling around, no
(12 play) 12 play, 12 play ooohh
1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 10 11 12
12 ways, ah
12 ways to love you baby, yeah yeah
You won't regret it baby
And you surely won't forget it baby
After I give you some of my 12 play
Baby, and your body's looking good to me
And in your eyes I can plainly see
That you need some of my
Just, just a little bit of my 12, 12 play
My story is much too sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some, they may go for cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically, too
Yet, I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously do not adore me
I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some gal in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick
You give me a boot
I get a kick out of you

[Intro]
Rap tune
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
The real is back, the ville is back
Flow bananas, here, peel this back
And what you'll find is, your highness
Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness
Carolina's finest, you knew that already
In terms of the greatest, I proved that already
And if you would like, I do it twice
I just sharpen my blade, for a minute became lost in my ways
This for my niggas that was tossed in the graves
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts
And then get lost in the days
We used to play before your coffin was made
Just got the call nigga got caught with a stray
Hope he's okay
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
Who know a nigga far too well, and that's the danger
Know me better than I know myself
I rip a page out my notebook in anger
And let these thoughts linger, singing

[Chorus]
Don't give 'em too much you (Don't give 'em too much you)
Don't let 'em take control (Don't let 'em take control)
It's one thing you do (It's one thing you do)
Don't let 'em taint your soul (Don't let 'em taint your soul)
If you believe in God (If you believe in God)
One thing's for sure (One thing's for sure)
If you ain't aim too high (If you ain't aim too high)
Then you aim too low (Then you aim too low)

[Verse 2]
What's the price for a black man life?
I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight
Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics
Look out the window 'cause tonight the city lit up with lights
Cameras and action
May no man alive come through and damage my faction
I brought you niggas with me 'cause I  love you like my brothers
And your mothers' like my mother
Think we need a plan of action
The bigger we get the more likely egos collide, it's just physics
Please let's put our egos aside, you my niggas
And should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies
I hope that we remember these
Nights full of Hennessy
When Hov around we switch up to that D'usse
Gotta show respect, one day we tryna stay where you stay
'Cause we from where you from
Not talkin' bout the slums
I'm talkin' 'bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb
Keep a black nigga dyin' by a black nigga gun
And keep on listening to the frontin' ass rap niggas son
Yeah I said 'son'
This is New York's finest
For 11 winters straight I took on New York's climate
Like show me New York's ladder
I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama to force the air force to find it
Never mind it, you'll never reach that
Cole is the hypnotist, control the game whenever he snap
That's every track, nigga

[Chorus]
Don't give 'em too much you (Don't give 'em too much you)
Don't let 'em take control (Don't let 'em take control)
It's one thing you do (It's one thing you do)
Don't let 'em taint your soul (Don't let 'em taint your soul)
If you believe in God (If you believe in God)
One thing's for sure (One thing's for sure)
If you ain't aim too high (If you ain't aim too high)
Then you aim too low (Then you aim too low)

[Verse 3]
I ain't serve no pies, I ain't slang no dope
I don't bring no lies, niggas sang my quotes
I don't play no games, boy I ain't no joke
Like the great Rakim, when I make my notes
You niggas might be L or you might be Kane
Or you might be Slick Rick with 19 chains
Or you might be Drizzy Drake or Kendrick Lamar
But check your birth date nigga, you ain't the god
Nah you ain't the god
Nigga, Cole the god (Cole the god, Cole the god)
January 28th

[Outro]
Make a million dollars off a rap tune
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
(*sound of baby laughing*)
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
I wanna make a million dollars off a rap tune
I'm gonna make a million dollars off a rap tune

[Verse 1: Emeli Sandé]
Talking loud, talking crazy
Locked me outside
Praying for the rain to come
Bone dry again
Guess it's true what they say
I'm always late
Say you need a little space
And I'm in your way

[Pre-Chorus: Emeli Sandé]
It hurts, but I remember every scar
And I've learned, but living is the hardest part

[Chorus: Emeli Sandé]
I can't believe what I did for love
I can't believe what I did for us
Oh, crash and we burn into flames
Stitch myself up and I do it again
I can't believe what I did for love
What I did for love
(What I did for love)
What I did for love
(What I did for love)
What I did for us
(What I did for love)
What I did for love
(What I did for love)
What I did for us

[Verse 2: Emeli Sandé]
I'm a fool for your games
But I always play
Can't admit it was a waste
Just too much at stake

[Pre-Chorus: Emeli Sandé]
It hurts, but I remember every scar
And I've learned, but living is the hardest part

[Chorus: Emeli Sandé]
I can't believe what I did for love
I can't believe what I did for us
Oh, crash and we burn into flames
Stitch myself up and I do it again
I can't believe what I did for love
(What I did for love)
What I did for love
(What I did for love)
What I did for us
(What I did for love)
What I did for love
(What I did for love)

I can't believe what I did for love

[Verse 1: The Script]
The colours will change
I love every shade of you
Don't lose your faith
Keep walking how you do
Don't you say it wasn't worth
All the pain and all the hurt
You're going through
And I'll always be with you

[Chorus: The Script]
Goodbye, friend
No, this is not the end
Lift up your head
Somewhere we'll meet again
Hold onto the moments we share
Those are the treasures that won't disappear
Goodbye friend

[Verse 2: The Script]
The world's just a place
And we're only passing through
Heaven awaits
Those that keep marching through
Don't you say the love lost
Wasn't worth the pain it caused
You're going through
Cause I'd take it all for you

[Chorus: The Script]
Goodbye, friend
No, this is not the end
Lift up your head
Somewhere we'll meet again
Hold onto the moments we share
Those are the treasures that won't disappear
Goodbye friend

[Verse 1: Vinz]
Inside us all, there's a hero to discover
There's no way we can triumph with out struggle
I'm just like you, are you tryna bring me down?
I'm just like you, help me turn this thing around

[Pre-Chorus: Vinz]
I dream at night of a better day
You and I in a better place
Don't know how but I know that I'll reach it
Don't know when but I know that we need it

[Chorus: Vinz]
Lift me up, don't hold me down
I don't wanna be down, don't bring me down
Lift me up, don't hold me down
I don't wanna be down, don't bring me down
Lift me up to higher ground
Not too proud to say I need you now
Lift me up, don't hold me down
I don't wanna be down, don't bring me down

[Verse 2: Nico]
We are meant to be here for one another
Don't forget you're my sister, you're my brother
I'm just like you, I've got troubles on my own
I'm just like you, I am tryna make it home

[Pre-Chorus: Nico]
I dream at night of a better day
You and I in a better place
Don't know how but I know that I'll reach it
Don't know when but I know that we need it

[Chorus: Nico]
Lift me up, don't hold me down
I don't wanna be down, don't bring me down
Lift me up, don't hold me down
I don't wanna be down, don't bring me down
Lift me up to higher ground
Not too proud to say I need you now
Lift me up, don't hold me down
I don't wanna be down, don't bring me down
Don't break me down, don't break me down
Don't break me down

[Verse 1: Vinz]
Inside us all, there's a hero to discover
There's no way we can triumph with out struggle
I'm just like you, are you tryna bring me down?
I'm just like you, help me turn this thing around

[Verse 1: John Legend]
Let's hit the road and away we go
Take a new direction to a different coast
Maybe we should try and put it on the line
You've gotta trust me now, turn up the radio
Tune out the world and roll with the melody
Baby, listen close and open up your mind

[Pre-Chorus: John Legend]
Imagine if anywhere
More than miles, I'll take you there
Knew one day, from the start
We'd be as one, now here we are

[Chorus: John Legend]
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
Listen, all we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen

[Verse 2: John Legend]
Soundtrack in the wind, like classic violins
I can be your rhythm in the silence
And every time we sing, it echoes in the sky
Let me close your eyes, help you fantasize
Make a kiss our playlist the entire night
Listen to the words as I let them fly

[Pre-Chorus: John Legend]
Imagine if anywhere
More than miles, I'll take you there
Knew one day, from the start
We'd be as one, now here we are

[Chorus: John Legend]
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
Listen, all we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
Listen, all we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen
All we gotta do is listen

[Verse 1: Bebe Rexha]
Black hearts, black days
Raindrops on my window pane
Streetlights, street life
Hot blood burning in my veins

[Pre-Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
History won't drag me down
I say no, no, no, I say no, no, no
It's buried six feet underground
Let it go, go, go, let it go

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
Hey, hey, what you say?
I've got no use for yesterday
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love right now
And if tomorrow never comes
I'm gonna stay forever young
These lungs of mine were made to scream and shout
I said hey, hey, what you say?
It seems like trouble's on the way
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love right now
It's singing oh, oh oh oh
I said hey, hey, what you say?
I've got no use for yesterday

[Verse 2: Bebe Rexha]
Tonight I got a new life
I gotta get right and get it moving
White lies left me snowblind
But now this time, I see right through it

[Pre-Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
History won't drag me down
I say no, no, no, I say no, no, no
It's buried six feet underground
Let it go, go, go, let it go

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
Hey, hey, what you say?
I've got no use for yesterday
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love right now
And if tomorrow never comes
I'm gonna stay forever young
These lungs of mine were made to scream and shout
I said hey, hey, what you say?
It seems like trouble's on the way
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love right now
It's singing oh, oh oh oh
I said hey, hey, what you say?
I've got no use for yesterday

[Verse 1: Jaymes Young]
I've known from the start
You would break my heart
You are cruel, you are
But I'll keep loving you
I want you to know
I'm not perfect, so
I'm a rolling stone
But I'll keep loving you

[Chorus: Jaymes Young & Birdy]
For the rest of my life
I promise that I, I'll keep loving you
Oh, I will stand by your side
And promise that I, I'll keep loving you

[Verse 2: Birdy]
I know you can see
I'm not what you need
My spirit's free
But I'll keep loving you
You are so wild
You've a restless mind
A wandering eye
But I'll keep loving you

[Chorus: Jaymes Young & Birdy]
For the rest of my life
I promise that I, I'll keep loving you
Oh, I will stand by your side
And promise that I, I'll keep loving you

[Bridge: Jaymes Young & Birdy]
I'm only a man
I'll give you my love
But I make mistakes
Cause it's in my blood
The world is so full
Of flaws and of rules
I promise that I
Will love you for you

[Chorus: Jaymes Young & Birdy]
For the rest of my life
I promise that I, I'll keep loving you
Oh, I will stand by your side
And promise that I, I'll keep loving you

[Verse 1: Ryan Tedder]
How many stars do you see now?
I must admit, I haven't looked
All the lives that we live
When we rush and we push
Till we bend, till we break
How many days have we lost now?
I must admit, I'm losing count
All of the time that we spend
Tryna do what we do
Cause it makes us feel sane

[Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
I'll stop right now but I'm stopping with you
I'll leave this town, but I'm leaving with you
I'm so tired of where we've been, life won't start until this ends
I'll stop right now but I'm stopping with you, I'll stop with you

[Verse 2: Ryan Tedder]
How many nights has it been now?
I must admit, no keeping count
All of the souls that we meet
In a rush, in a race, trying to find better streets
I'm on my way, on my way, now
I admit, it took its toll
Trading your life for the light
For the night, it ain't right if it's all that you know

[Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
I'll stop right now but I'm stopping with you
I'll leave this town, but I'm leaving with you
I'm so tired of where we've been, life won't start until this ends
I'll stop right now but I'm stopping with you, I'll stop with you
Getting , getting, getting
Getting , getting, getting

[Verse: Skylar Grey]
You can take a swing at my ego
You can make a run for my crown
Even with an army of people
You ain't gonna take us down
You can aim your evil right at us
You can drop your bombs on the ground
Even if your stare makes me nervous
You ain't gonna take us down

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
There'll be no need for crying
If darkness fills the skies
We'll go on forever
Like the phoenix, we
Will rise up from the ashes
This world is ours tonight
We'll go on forever
Like the phoenix, we
Will rise
We will rise
Getting , getting, getting
Getting , getting, getting

[Verse: Skylar Grey]
You can take a swing at my ego
You can make a run for my crown
Even with an army of people
You ain't gonna take us down
You can aim your evil right at us
You can drop your bombs on the ground
Even if your stare makes me nervous
You ain't gonna take us down

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
There'll be no need for crying
If darkness fills the skies
We'll go on forever
Like the phoenix, we
Will rise up from the ashes
This world is ours tonight
We'll go on forever
Like the phoenix, we
Will rise
We will rise

Getting , getting, getting
Getting , getting, getting
Getting , getting, getting
Getting , getting, getting
Getting , getting, getting
I am the sand stuck under miles of rock
Watching the dry air sweep away my thoughts
As we travel protected by shards of glass
Driving through the history of a million memories

In a sea of a hundred dead and loving souls
In a sea of a hundred dead and loving souls
In a sea of a hundred dead and loving souls
Climbing a thousand unclimbed trees
I don't know I want to know how it would feel
To be on top of one of these!

I am the root
Quickly ascending
Up through the surrounding dirt
Quickly devoured by a hungry sun
Quickly devoured by a hungry son
Who is my father
And we are alike
We look alike we talk alike
We are alike
We are alike
We are alike we look alike
We talk alike
Thats why Im hungry
Like the bellowing sky
This is no lie
As sure as light
Entering eye
Want to stay high
Everything's cool too cool so cool
And I remember that everything falls

So I take a look around me now, as I speak
And I imagine a disinterested crowd
Talking aloud
And I think of what I want most
And the crowd disappears
And a fixated gaze envelopes my wondering mind
And then she recruits and takes me to this place
I've been there before and that's where I saw her face

In a sea of a hundred dead and loving souls
In a sea of a hundred dead and loving souls
In a sea of a hundred dead and loving souls
Climbing a thousand unclimbed trees
I don't know I want to know how it would feel
To be on top of one of these!

[Hook: Ice Cube]
Blasten
Niggas drivin round with they tanks and they shotguns
The only way I'm quittin if you bitches get me killed
Blasten
Niggas drivin round with they tanks and they shotguns
Screams of the room it gives me chills as i pop one

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Left that boy bloody red
"Why'd you leave him layin there?"
Cause he ran, then he said
Take this bread and make the spread
Break it up, and nigga don't be scared
I was only there prepared
I began to see that he was fucking round with the feds
Locin round to get inside a real rider
And have him snitching and getting real shit up outta names
40 consolidated to 44
They said he singin like a bird everywhere he go
Case is over, more pain but no pay
And these the G's that been fuckin up the gangbang
We all got one, nigga not one
Nigga pop one, got a shotgun, nigga drop one
You see me? That's Snoopy Whodini
Makin niggas dissapear, then pop em back in black teenies
To me, I keen satan but keep that on the low
Load it up, and we already foe
And they already know

[Hook: Ice Cube]

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Set the stage
Turn the page
Grab the gauge
Shoot it quick

Can't keep up
Loc' he got a cold stroke
Meantime, me and my
We just gon' let it go
Ay, what you thinkin' for?
Ay, what you think he say?
Everybody in and out of L.A
We got niggas gettin' shizzot
And rats on the plizzot
And plus we got to deal with these crooked ass cizzops
Aw no, the screams of a mother cry
And blaze and flames in the scenes of a homocide

[Hook: Ice Cube]

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
My very first gat was a fucking deuce-deuce
In the hood late night like i had some juice
Graduated to a .38, now I'm hard
Practiced my aim up in the back yard
Had the flash on fools that scooped the heat
How I got my mothafuckin' name in the street
By now a nigga was straight bangin'
159th street is where i'm hangin'
380 in a stash spot, dash for the regal
Now rolling with the pistol was so illegal
But niggas was dying so, so fuck that
They in they league, got one and get your gat
Now it's 9's and AK's
And all kinds of shells where a dead body lays
But never take it as a threat
To 

[?] and dogg carryin' heat? Nigga you bet

[Hook]

[Intro]
Riding solo
Riding dolo

You better decide
I say let's go, and they ready to ride

And new veces inside, yeah let's aim to the side
And if they inside, acting a mess, we'll leave messes inside
What ya talking about? Nigga, this the slaughterhouse
I mean the Carter house, big B the Whopper house
What ya talking about? Nigga, this the slaughterhouse
I mean the Carter house, big B the Whopper house

[Hook]

Nigga suck my dick, eat my bitch clit, yeah!

[Verse 2]
I'm a big dog, she my dream girl
Let's leave Earth, and go to Thug's World
Come back? No we ain't coming back
Cause she gave me head at the week, I finish she got her cum back
So she stuck with me, like a thumbtack
And I'm following her, like she got her taxes
Smoking weed with P, I call him Wiz
Yeah, school of hard, not flow I call it quiz
This rap shit's my biz
You can miss school with this
Or mix kush with raps
And I get high of that
I'm yelling "Bye!" of that

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
No place she would rather be
Than dancing in front of me
Gucci Mane I'm from the street
But I got ice all over me
Got my dawg with me
I swear my niggas like some dobermans
Ya kill with them just ask and will
I think that they provoking me
Yellow kush I'm smoking it
Hunnid mill, make hopefully
You been close minded
One up on the kid I bet I open it
Bricksquad line I'm pushing it
Cali niggas growing it
Valley niggas cooking it and serving it, you knowing it
Some say I'm a genius with it, some say I'm a poet
Some of these niggas that wanna ball but get the ball can't tote it
Half of these niggas that hit the mall don't buy shit, that's pathetic
I'm vacuum sealing and stashing this shit tryna dodge them German shepherds

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
The word around the town, is my price is at the lowest
It's a low down dirty game, but I bet my niggas is the lowest
Don't worry what I'm about to do with this money, cuz this money ain't yours
I'm a billionaire and I'm making, but I guess these niggas don't know it
I'm riding around in a Lambo, and I bet my car the lowest
And I like the way that she drop it down, but her friend go down the lowest
I'm counting money, I'm staying down, I'm hustling with my boys
It's a drought in town, but I'm still good, cuz my price is the lowest

[Verse 2: Rich Tha Kid]
It's a drought in town, still got the pounds
Bentley Coupe, I ride around
50 straps, me and OG Mac this a kick door bitch where it's at
Still sippin' lean, weightin' too much
Mothafuck 12, free Guwop
Thirteen, I was running from the cops
Jugging on niggas on the block
Go blind if ya look at this bezzle
Got so many hoes on my schedule
Bitch QC pull up flexing
Too many rocks in my necklace
I got bricks, my price is the lowest
Fucking yo bitch, I'm rich and she know it
We want a check and the respect
My young nigga pull up with tec
Dirty ass ho, can't trust no bitch, my wrist on froze
I got the work in the bowl
Why is the dope on your nose
Niggas hating but its fuck fuck
Pass the hoes, I don't wanna cuff
Rich nigga came from the bottom
Word around my rollie flooded

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
The word around the town, is my price is at the lowest
It's a low down dirty game, but I bet my niggas is the lowest
Don't worry what I'm about to do with this money, cuz this money ain't yours
I'm a billionaire and I'm making, but I guess these niggas don't know it
I'm riding around in a Lambo, and I bet my car the lowest
And I like the way that she drop it down, but her friend go down the lowest
I'm counting money, I'm staying down, I'm hustling with my boys
It's a drought in town, but I'm still good, cuz my price is the lowest

[Verse 3: OG Maco]
We was waiting and start taking over
Like the mumps and measles now we running media
Make your wife a eat her
She licking sacks for the Saks Fifth
How you greet her with a mouth kiss?
Fuck ignorance
Full account is bliss
To fool em out of ere, to get your noggin split
Free Wop man, fuck feds
Always came in like the 3
Ass double Team
And we can  double barrels
Get the wood (?)
Momma said she got that good head
And got a bright future, and I watch her play it
Catch a check, bitch I'm known to play ya
Dirty game in my hand full
Get a phone full of 

[?]
Mix it up then, then resale

Young mogul, I'm chasing Diddy

Spots 12 like a body flippin'

[?]
Throwin pistols, I've been thinking money longer than I remember
Yea yea

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
The word around the town, is my price is at the lowest
It's a low down dirty game, but I bet my niggas is the lowest
Don't worry what I'm about to do with this money, cuz this money ain't yours

I'm counting money, I'm staying down, I'm hustling with my boys
It's a drought in town, but I'm still good, cuz my price is the lowest

[Chorus: Trey Songz]

I'll eat a motherfucker alive
Y'all niggas flexing, you are welcome to die
Stop playing, bitch, we multiply
And then divide y'all, then hide all
Hey, fuck the law (fuck)
Fuck the cops (Fuck)
Bitch, I've been the boss
Drop bombs on anybody's shit
And head to your crib, and fuck anybody's bitch
Y'all old, bitch we on some new shit
New cars, new homes, new bitch
Hit the club and pop the same old shit
And if you don't like it, nigga fuck yo clique!
Yeah!

[Chorus]
We sitting at the top of this motherfucka
You can get knocked off of this motherfucka
Try not to get knocked off of this motherfucka
Cause at the bottom it's the blood suckers
And I've been chasing this money for a moment, but I'm still in strive
And when I catch the bitch, she gon' die
I'ma kill you bitch!
The shots out the five, I'll eat you alive
I'll eat you alive!

[Verse 2]
Free Unfoonk, free Dulu
Free Zoo Crew, free Zoo Crew
This a horse, not a deer on my shirt
But there's a deer on the verge
And write me there first
Haha, sincerely yours, Thug
Shouts out to Slug
Hey, shouts out to my mug
In my jail like sometimes, you know I got a plug
You think they pop them paralyze pills, they laid up
You think I'm popping extensions in the trap, I stayed up (bars)
To me, you're a bug, I just bought some 22s for the coupe
Three letters, called 'em Uggs, I mean Thug

[Chorus]
We sitting at the top of this motherfucka
You can get knocked off of this motherfucka
Try not to get knocked off of this motherfucka
Cause at the bottom it's the blood suckers
And I've been chasing this money for a moment, but I'm still in strive
And when I catch the bitch, she gon' die
I'ma kill you bitch!
The shots out the five, I'll eat you alive
I'll eat you alive!

[Verse 3]
This verse should have went first, hearse
Plus your hands are getting too big, it's gonna burst
I'll eat your ass up then, burp
Then hop up in the phantom, don't pull the curtain
This weed is so loud, I can't hear you
Yugi bear ass little niggas, I can't fear you
House 20 minutes from Lennox, I'm not near you
Sniper Rifle your ass, with the chopper, I dare you
I'll give nigga some sense, I'll deal you
Jump to the bullshit, the money I hear you
Play with any nigga in my crew, I dare you
And I'll eat you alive, I'll eat you alive

[Chorus]
We sitting at the top of this motherfucka
You can get knocked off of this motherfucka
Try not to get knocked off of this motherfucka
Cause at the bottom it's the blood suckers
And I've been chasing this money for a moment, but I'm still in strive
And when I catch the bitch, she gon' die
I'ma kill you bitch!
The shots out the five, I'll eat you alive
I'll eat you alive!

Anytime I'm in Miami I'm in Bell Harbor with a dumb chick
I done went designer crazy, Marc Jacob on my new spits
You could say I'm very popular, all my clothes popular
You ain't even in my view, even wearin' binoculars

She bad and she 'yella, and I'm very proud of her
Cause she got designer everything, in the club with everything
Her bag, her shoes, her fit, her shades I'm talkin bout everything

[Verse 1]
I am the provo king, the leader of the unknown beings
I am exactly what the fuck you're thinkin' provo means
The line I walk is thinner than a fuckin' yo-yo string
So what the fuck is crazy? For me there's no such thing
So much emotion, I can sense it but it's so unseen
Cause when the other side is callin', your phone don't ring
You know what my logo means, wear more than some Polo jeans
Somethin', somethin', somethin', virtuoso dreams
The tubes is knockin', you pillow talkin in red, white and blue pajamas
Sometimes I'm super honest, cause I can't be who you want me to be
Or how they want me to speak
Yeah I'm a free thinker, that's why they're comin' for me
Yeah you niggas asleep, that's why I'm callin' you sheep
Deep fry your mind, you a human omelette with cheese
The all seein' eye, the beast monitors me
Your mama, your daddy, your auntie, your uncle, your neice

[Hook]
And a nigga came up, lookin' in the street lights
Tryna dodge a gun, and the judge and police lights
We out here starvin' tryna find a way to eat right
'Bout to touch the sky, let a nigga get his feet right
Nigga came up, nigga came up
I said a nigga came up, a nigga came up
A nigga came up, lookin' at the street lights
Tryna survive another night on the east side
And we out here starvin' tryna find a way to eat right
'Bout to touch the sky, let a nigga get his feet right
A nigga came up, a nigga came up
I said a nigga came up, a nigga came up

[Verse 2]
Redeem myself for who? Redeem myself for you?
Redeem myself for your squad? Redeem myself for your crew?
I'm tradin' blows with a giant, I'm in the ring with a deuce
I broke myself out the chains, I cut myself out the noose
So fuck your slanted review, you write at home in your room
So busy spreadin' the hate, you end up missin' the truth
You mothafuckas can shove it, I never back down for nothin'
The man got his hand up your pants, you just a puppet
I'm throwin' a fit and fussin' cause niggas killin' their cousin
Make it worse, he just a kid, kid of your mama's brother
Ask the world, can I live, live, live? No discussion
'Fore they put you in the picture, first they gotta check the color
Where are your rights that get left in the dust?
They get the cheese and don't throw us the crust
Plus sayin' please doesn't make it a must
So we get strapped, give me buck or I bust

[Hook]

[Bridge] x2
Dark skinned nigga, light skinned nigga
Don't mean shit when the light man hit yah
I said dark skinned nigga, light skinned nigga
See you on the news, hope your white friends miss you
Cause a nigga came up

[Intro]
Yeah, boss shit
Turn it up
Hah!
Lyrical exercise
They be like "Luda how come I don't see you out that much?"
Let me tell you somethin' nigga

[Verse]
I ain't even gotta come inside the club, nigga
Pull up in the Lamborghini Aventor door just to fuck wit' cha
I see your chick she see my candy drippin' and me ridin' chrome
Give a little bit of this game and next thing we ridin' home
I press a button my car drop
Press another button my car stop
Women give me that soft bottom
And I do away with that hard top
Gettin' good brain, whippin' wood grain
Swervin' all up and around your hood man
No bullshit, you wanna trade the heat?
Then I got the nine like Luol Deng
Shooters goin', nigga dunk that
Fifth of 'yac, I drunk that
Livin' legend all on the mic
And none of you niggas will ever become that
My car shakin', my trunk peak
Ain't even a need to compete
While you ride in the back of your boy ride
Your bitch all in my front seat, ahh!

[Outro]
What's in the past is history, what's in the future is a mystery
In other words don't love me for what I've done
Love me for what the fuck I'm 'bout to do, nigga
Yeah, "Burnin' Bridges" December sixteenth
Exclusively on Google Play biatch
"Ludaversal" March thirty first
I ain't playin' with you niggas
Woo!

[Intro]
You can break my bones
But your heart of stone can't break the seal
Can't break the seal

[Verse 1]
That's right I'm on the edge
Damn right I'm on the line
Blame it on my attitude
And the thoughts that's on my mind
All because I came up on the poorer side
Where the don't provide
Over time you tend to feel like you supposed to sail
Or you supposed to fail, or you supposed to die
Or you supposed to fly
Decatur's own, poster child
My "day one team" still hold me down
New niggas just want to get closer now
I'm like hold up now
What do I know you now? We are we homies now?
Lookin' at me like I'm holdin' out
What do I owe you now?
It ain't shit  that nobody can tell me
They look at my train of thought
And they try to figure a way to derail me
But the way that they verbal assaultin'
As big as they thought it was not necessarily
That's the way it is so apparently
One day you're the hero, the next you're the villain
Your own people ready to bury ya

[Hook]
You can break my bones
But your heart of stone can't break the seal
Can't break the seal
You can take all I own
But you can never take the soul away from me
Away from me

[Verse 2]
Rest in peace, rest in peace
To my pastor, rest in peace
Can't look back at yesterday
What can they say, what's left to see?
I flip the style up and became the thing  they said I'd never be
Whatever obstacle they threw I have surpassed successfully
And you can try to overlook me but I'm too much of a giant
And if I ain't at the top, shit I must be right beside it
So don't try to sell me bullshit, I'm too gifted to buy it
If I sold common sense, you'd be too stupid to buy it, uhh
I can't dumb it down, how the fuck I sound?
Tryin' to dumb it down
You just thought you knew me 'til you figured out
What I was about
Cause what I was is not the same as now
I ain't jaded that's just how I view the game and how I play it
It's just greed and entertainment
But it ain't so entertainin'
When niggas is hungry and you in they city
You lookin' like money and fingers is itchin'
You won't see it comin' you totally ignorant to it
No one in your clique is a shooter
Every killer say that he'll do it
Every nigga claim that they is the truest
But you couldn't prove it until they go through it
When temperatures flare up and niggas get stupid
There's no longer hype it's no longer 'bout music
There's no more illusion
No more confusion
Know who you can trust, who you can fuck
That bitch that you with, she settin' you up
But never forget that karma's a bitch
When she comes around, remember to duck (duck)

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I was so in love with you
You rarely see a love that true
Wasn't that enough for you?
Wasn't that enough for you?
I would climb a mountain
I wouldn't want to see you fall
Rock climb for you
And give you a reason for it all

[Hook]
You kept on thinking
You were the only one
Too busy thinking
Love is a gun

[Bridge]
Hit me like a slow bullet
Like a slow bullet
Took me some time to realize it

[Hook 2]
You kept on thinking
You were the only one
Too busy thinking
Love is a gun

I know the end before
The story's been told
It's not that complicated
But you're gonna need a bullet proof soul

You kept on thinking
You were the only one
Too busy thinking
Love is a gun

I know the end before
The story's been told
It's not that complicated
But you're gonna need a bullet proof soul

[Verse 2]
You were trigger happy, baby
You never warned me, let me free
It's not that complicated
But you're going to need a bullet proof soul
Think you got it but you got all the trouble you need
I came in like a lamb
But I intend to leave like a lion

[Outro]
It hit me like a slow bullet
It hit me like a slow bullet

[Intro]
Memorize
Memorize
Memorize
Memorize
Memorize
Memorize

Memorize

[Verse]
I memorized the wayward expressions
Never look down
Never let you see me down
I memorized the way no directions
Can I come over now
I'd like to stay a little while
I memorized your body exposed
I can fuck you all night long
From a memory alone
I never forget a face
Don’t go plastic on me
Nothing’s set in stone
You're not dipped in gold
Dipped in gold
You can’t breathe if you’re dipped in gold
You are not on paper
You are not a copy
You're so, you're so..so thick, so thick
I'm in a battle with my heartbeat
The more I struggle the more I get deep
I go full throttle down the dark streets
And there is trouble ahead I get weak
It's like I'm running through a red light
Girl you know you make me weak
I should be hittin' all the brake lights
Hold up, hold up oh!

Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back cause
We've gone too far
I'll drive you like a fastcar

Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back cause
We've gone too far
I'll drive you like a fastcar
It isn't like me to get caught up
But when you running you're never quite free
I wasn't really meant to find love
But now you found me and got me all weak
It's like I'm running through a red light
Girl you know you make me weak
I should be hittin' all the brake lights
Hold up, hold up oh!

Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back cause
We've gone too far
I'll drive you like a fastcar

Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back cause
We've gone too far
I'll drive you like a fast car
(oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
I'll drive you like a fast car

I'm in a battle with my heartbeat
The more I struggle the more I get deep
I go full throttle down the dark streets
And there is trouble ahead I get weak
I get weak I get weak
Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back cause
We've gone too far
I'll drive you like a fastcar

Girl you really turn me on, on, on,on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back cause
We've gone too far
I'll drive you like a fastcar
(oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
I'll drive you like a fastcar!

[Intro]
Young Thug getting back?
And the chopper super long

[Hook]
Baby, this is my life
Young Thug balling
Stack the money up, and it spend all at the mall and
Baby, this is my life
The whole crew eating
Bricks came Monday and they gone by the weekend
Baby, this is my life
I done wrote a lot of track
,they be like "Appreciate you, Young Thug"
And every time we about to leave
They be like "Come back to my club"
I had a show up in LA, them niggas swore I was the plug
I'm sipping on some syrup, man I think that I'm in love

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Damn, and every time I thought about quitting
It felt crazy to the Thug, like something was missing
I had to sneak and do my thing, cause I didn't have permission
Now I'm in your back yard lurkin, pre-mission
I told them keep it 200, I blast for it
But he still keeping it 100, like his dashboard
The we ain't had nothing for credit, only cash for it
And if he sweet, rob him without a mask for it
And fuck you, I can decide myself
And don't mention racks, cause I provide myself
I'm standing next to the best so I'm beside myself
And The flow sick, but the chopper guide m
