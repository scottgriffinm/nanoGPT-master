It's not my fault you're angry

Ecstasy—

[Verse 1]
I had a out-of-body off a half a Molly
At the afterparty, had to grab a shawty
She was in the corner all melancholy
We was both rollin' off the edamame
I feel the Devil on me, I feel the pressure on me
Yeah, I said it, call me up and met a zombie on
First the brain releases dopamines
Then you lose all control of things
I'm an addict myself, so I know a fiend
When I see one in Fashion Nova jeans
I'm in that euphoric psychedelic state
All I remember is an angelic face
I felt myself start to elevate to a place called
Ecstasy, ecstasy, (uh) ecstasy (uh)

[Verse 2]
Euphoria, it's four of ya
There's only two girls, feel like it's four of ya
Before you take this journey, here's a tutorial
Take the Adderall with the Xans, that's the morsecode
She took two and some coke, that's an Oreo
You don't remember shit, that's how the story goes
Comin' down, you gon' feel horrible
Just make sure you drink a lot of water, though
Now you startin' to feel the side effects
Like you ain't had the right type of rest
When you grind your teeth and get out of breath
I suggest you take a seat 'cause you high as hell
But don't trip, you fully functional
You just feelin' comfortable
Stop at Walgreens, get a lunchable
You spent all your money on

[Sample]
Ecstasy, ecstasy, (uh) ecstasy (uh)
Ecstasy, ecstasy, (uh) ecstasy (uh)
Ecstasy, ecstasy, (uh) ecstasy (uh)
Ecstasy, ecstasy, (uh) ecstasy (uh)

[Verse 1]
The bright August sun feels like yellow
And the white of her eyes is so yellow
The tiny lie I told to myself is making me hollow
I've been choking up truths that I couldn't swallow

[Verse 2]
I'm falling apart over a memory
And the weight in my heart is getting too heavy
'Cause every word is a nail that's loosening slowly
And I can't hammer it down enough to keep holding in

[Chorus]
And I could lie
But it's never made me feel good inside
I'm still so blue
I can't erase the hue, it's just colored over

[Verse 3]
I'm thinking of her from over the ocean
See her face in the waves, her body is floating
And in her eyes, like clementines, I know that she's fading
And the light of the sun is only a daydream

[Chorus]
And I could lie
But it's never made me feel good inside
I'm still so blue
I can't erase the hue, it's just colored over

[Outro]
Loving you isn't enough
You'll still be deep in the ground when it's done
I'll know the day when it comes
I'll feel the cold as they put out my sun
Loving you isn't enough
You'll still be deep in the ground when it's done
I'll know the day when it comes
I'll feel the cold as they put out my sun

[Verse 1: Madonna]
I'm tired of being far away from home
Far from what can help, far from where it's safe
Hope it's not too late
Rush, rush, rush on you, love, love, loved on you
Love you like a fool, put my trust in you

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna & Swae Lee]
'Cause you're the one I crave
And my cravings get dangerous
The feelings never fade
I don't think we should play with this
Said come, come give me strength
I don't think we should wait for this

A loner, days we used to chase
It's do or die, yeah, my love life can get crazy (Crazy)
It's on the line, girl, you're risking everything (Thing)

Ran and ran and ran so fast, a thing to last, and there it was

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna, Swae Lee & Both]
'Cause you're the one I crave (Crave)

My cravings get dangerous
I don't think we should wait

[Verse 1: Madonna]
I'm tired of being far away from home
Far from what can help, far from where it's safe
Hope it's not too late
Rush, rush, rush on you, love, love, loved on you
Love you like a fool, put my trust in you

[Intro: Eminem & Crowd]
Detroit, what's my name? Marshall!
I can't hear you!
One more time, what's my name? Marshall!
Bitches and gentlemen! It's showtime!
Hurry hurry, step right up!
Introducing the star of our show
His name is Marshall!
You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
So without further ado, I bring to you Marshall!

[Verse 1: Eminem, Proof & Crowd]
You 'bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest
Most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest known artist
Chip off the old block, but old Doc is back
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm rooms doors off the hinges
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Vrinn, vrinn! Yeah, here I come, I'm inches
Away from you, dear, fear none Uh Huh!
Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1, so Come on!

[Chorus: Eminem, Dr. Dre & Proof]
Let's get down to business Detroit!
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, I want everybody let's shut the shit down To sing this shit!
On these clowns; can I get a witness? Hell yeah!
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
Say what! On these clowns; can I get a witness? Hell yeah!

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Quick, gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers, Proof, holy bat syllables!
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Detroit
When I'm gone, time to get rid of these rap criminals
So skip to your lou while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it
Flow's too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
In eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up, there's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People, when you're rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on; so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Detroit's carnival, c'mon!

[Chorus: Eminem, Dr. Dre, Proof & Everyone]
Now let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, everybody say what! let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? Hell yeah!
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? Hell yeah!
The person you're calling... is on another line
Just leave your message after the tone
And when you're done, press hash, or just hang up

You're my everything
You make me feel alright
You're the only thing
That makes me feel alright
You're my everything
You make me feel alright
And you're the only thing
I never feel alright

I guess I have to go
And in my silence
It's so menacing
And when I'm left alone
It's so damaging
And in this violence
The walls cave in
I'm not able
To escape it all
'Cause you're my everything, I have no worth
And you're the only thing that makes life work
Thought I hated everything, but it's not worth
Thought I hated everything

Another lonely night
Another lonely night
You're my everything
You make me feel alright
You're the only thing
That makes me feel alright
You're my everything
You make me feel just fine
And you're the only thing
I never feel alright

I guess I have to go
I guess I have to go

[Verse 1]
Take a dip, if you're alone, take your time
Take a ticket, take the train to the end of the line
See where you can go, you spent it, it's plastic, no do or die
Better flip it, think about it, you'll do just fine, well

[Refrain]
These things will come and go
Deep in the metropole

[Verse 2]
Throw a stone, see it land, forget its flight
Draw a line in the sand between your thighs
Just to see which way you go
So you got this, you're the lead, feel your own
Battle through it, consume it, then let it go, girl

[Refrain]
But don't forget you're not alone
Deep in the metropole

[Verse 3]
The ache and thunder in the storms of your mind
Soak it in, for the rain will pass in time
Nothing wrong in sinking low
You're the omen of paradise
You're the ghost they put aside

[Bridge]
But don't forget you're not alone
Sometimes you're stretched
But don't forget you're not alone
Sometimes you're stretched

[Outro]
Every minute, every second, you're not alone, you're not alone
You're not alone, you're not alone
You're not alone, my girl (Sometimes you're stretched)
Sometimes you're stretched, sometimes you're stretched, ooh
I hang my head for those
Who ain't been held too close
In times of pain
When the ceiling drips
The room's bathed in grey
Outside's a trip
For another day

I keep telling those
Expelling those
Negative hoes to go away
But it seems to grip
More everyday
Walls get taller
Self-medicate
"And how did you get this low?"
That's what the illness spoke
For every word they had to say
Better off just leaving me this way
Better off just to leave it
Guess this ain't a world that I dreamt of
How many hits can one bum take?
How many things can one boy make?
I wrap myself inside my duvet
You think those blue giants feel the same?
You think they ever have these days?
You think they ever have these days?
You think they ever have these days?

[Verse 1]
Where are you going?
The day's about to end
Such a funny life I lead
I'm sittin', soakin' in the times
I bleed
Watch it flow right out of me

[Verse 2]
Why stop reading?
When the page is 'bout to turn
Such a funny life I lead
I think about it all the time
I sleep
Yeah, someone told me it gets worse, I disbelieve
Thought I'd be overseas
Curing disease but
Now it's part of me

[Refrain]
She's alright
Such a funny life I lead
Such a funny life
Such a funny life
Such a funny life
Such a funny life
Such a funny life
(Such a funny life, such a funny life)

[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Y'all know what this is!

[Verse 1: Usher]
My mind was changed, I'm glad you made it
Intoxicated, your vibe's amazing
Feel the love in the air, baby, you know (You know)
Ain't no rush, we've been at it, where the time go? (Oh, oh-oh)
You gon' end up showin' me now
'Cause I done had one too many drinks
And I know that you feel me the way I (I) been feelin' you
And it's cool, that you
You got a motive and I think I like it
I know all your insecurities
I hope that you're open, my body gives notice
And I want your energy, girl, gimme that (Girl, gimme that)

[Chorus: Usher]
Good lovin', no questions
Reach out and you'll touch me
Bad habits, don't judge me
Just don't waste my time
Good lovin', no questions, babe (Ooh)
Reach out and you'll touch me (Ooh)
Bad habits, don't judge me (Ooh)
Just don't waste my time

[Verse 2: Ella Mai]
Ooh, late night
Coffee in the morning, what a date night
Better play right
Don't be timid when you in it, better lay right (Yeah, yeah)
I know you wanna go there
I see it, stop frontin', come here
I know you can drive it, chauffeur
Anticipate your touch down (Down)
Put me down like right now (Now)
Let's be lovers and friends, let's rendezvous
Boy, I got plans for you (Yeah)
'Cause I'm motivated, I'm yours for the taking
Look no further, I got what you need (Ha, ooh)
Baby, I'm open (Yeah), you got my attention
Undivided, oh, baby, come give me that

[Chorus: Usher, Ella Mai, & Usher & Ella Mai]
Good lovin', no questions (Good lovin', baby)
Reach out, and you'll touch me (Yeah)
Bad habits, don't judge me
Just don't waste my time (Don't you waste my time)
Good lovin', no questions, babe (No questions, babe)
Reach out, and you'll touch me (Oh baby, yeah)
Bad habits, don't judge me
Just don't waste my time

[Bridge: Usher, Ella Mai]
Girl, it's about to go down (Ooh)
And I ain't here to play around (Ooh)
Ladies, if you're here with somebody
And you know you want their body
Go and let 'em hear you say it loud
Boy, it's about to go down (Ooh, go down)
Hear what you're sayin', come and show me now (Come and show me now)
Fellas, if you with somebody
And you know you want their body
Then let me hear you say it loud

[Chorus: Usher, Ella Mai, & Usher & Ella Mai]
Good lovin', no questions (Ooh)
Reach out, and you'll touch me (Girl)
Bad habits, don't judge me
Just don't waste my time
Good lovin', no questions, babe (Ooh, no questions, babe)
Reach out and you'll touch me (Ooh)
Bad habits, don't judge me
Just don't waste my time

[Outro: Ella Mai]
No, no, no, no
Just don't waste my time

[Verse 1]
Gotta see it to believe it, sky never looked so blue
So hard to leave it, that's what I always do
So I keep thinking back to a time under the canyon moon

[Verse 2]
The world's happy waitin', door's yellow, broken blue
I heard Jenny saying, "Go get the kids from school"
And I keep thinking back to the time under the canyon moon

[Refrain]
I'll be gone too long from you

[Verse 3]
Staring at the ceiling, two weeks and I'll be home
Carry the feeling, through Paris, all through Rome
And I'm still thinking back to the time under the canyon moon

[Chorus]
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going home
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going home

[Verse 4]
Quick pause in conversation, she plays songs I've never heard
An old lover's hippie music, pretends not to know the words
And I keep thinking back to the time under the canyon moon

[Refrain]
I'll be gone too long from you

[Chorus]
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going home
I'm going, oh, I'm going (I'm going home)
I'm going, oh, I'm going  (I'm going home)
I'm going, oh, I'm going home (Yeah)
I'm going, oh, I'm going (I'm going home)
I'm going, oh, I'm going  (I'm going home)
I'm going, oh, I'm going home (Hey)

[Intro]
Sunflower
Sunflower, my eyes want you more than a melody
Let me inside, wish I could get to know you
Sunflowers sometimes keep it sweet in your memory
I was just tongue-tied

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna make you feel bad
But I've been trying hard not to talk to you
Sunflower (Sunflower, sunflower)

[Chorus]
I couldn't want you any more
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor
I couldn't want you any more
Tonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight)

[Verse]
Wondering, headshake
Tired eyes are the death of me
Mouthful of toothpaste before I got to know you
I've got your face hung up high in the gallery
I love this shade, sunflower, sunflower
Your flowers just died, plant new seeds in the melody
Let me inside, I wanna get to know you

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna make you feel bad
But I've been trying hard not to act a fool
Sunflower (Sunflower, sunflower)

I couldn't want you any more
Tonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight)

[Intro]
Hey!

[Verse 1]
Golden, golden, golden as I open my eyes
Hold it, focus, hoping, take me back to the light
I know you were way too bright for me
I'm hopeless, broken, so you wait for me in the sky
Brown my skin just right
You're so golden

[Chorus]
You're so golden
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone when it ends
Don't wanna let you know
I don't wanna be alone
But I can feel it take a hold (I can feel it take a hold)
I can feel you take control (I can feel you take control)
Of who I am, and all I've ever known
Lovin' you's the antidote
Golden

[Chorus]
You're so golden
I don't wanna be alone
You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken

You're so golden
You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken

Scotty, can’t you see?
You’re the guy i wish i could be
The stories, the drawing, all of your books
I’ll take it all over my good looks
The pressure
To be the coolest in class
It’s not worth it and i know it won’t last

And yes i’ve had sex and it feels great
The girls body, the butt, the shape, it’s amazing
I ride like no other
Except for when you're hanging with your brother

But back to sex, such a good feeling
Call me pig boy ‘cause you know i be squealin’

Back to you number one big bro
I love you scotty, just had to let you know

Every day, my diamonds dancin', it's a mosh-pit
Different color, living color, how much sparkle can I get?
Flyer than Harry Potter on the cover of your book
Solitary, yellow canary, Yaya Diamonds in my boogers
Clear white crystals be the reason that your old lady is winnin'
Flawless diamonds is the motion is the newest silent killer (Woah)
I came from out the trash can surrounded by nothing but killers (Wo-woah)
My Benz tall as an Avalanche and it cost eight figures (Woah-woah-woah)
Blue Lamborghini Urus, baby, take a ride
Tempur-Pedic seats gon' hug you when you glide high
I put Molly in the Juice in the fridge and it's mine
Ain't no cap for you dirty bitches ran up

Coucou

[Chorus]
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me

[Verse 1]
I, I confess I can tell that you are at your best
I'm selfish so I'm hating it
I noticed that there's a piece of you in how I dress
Take it as a compliment

[Chorus]
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me

[Verse 2]
I, I just miss
I just miss your accent and your friends
Did you know I still talk to them?

[Bridge]
Does he take you walking 'round his parents' gallery?

[Chorus]
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me
Don't you call him "baby" (Coucou)
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me (Coucou)

[Outro: Camille Rowe]
Coucou ! Tu dors ? Oh, j'suis désolée...
Bah non... Nan, c'est pas important...
Ouais, on a été à la plage, et maintenant on—
Parfait ! Allez !

[Verse 1]
I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left

[Chorus]
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'

[Verse 2]
You said you cared, and you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say

[Chorus]
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'

[Bridge]
And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again

[Chorus]
What am I now? What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'

[Verse 1]
Don't blame me for falling
I was just a little boy
Don’t blame the drunk caller
Wasn't ready for it all

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't blame me, darling
Not even a little bit, I was away
And I’m just an arrogant son of a bitch
Who can't admit when he's sorry

[Chorus]
Don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, it's hard for me to go home
Be so lonely

[Verse 2]
I just hope you see me in a little better light
Do you think it's easy being of the jealous kind?
’Cause I miss the shape of your lips
You’ll win, it's just a trick
And this is it, so I’m sorry

[Chorus]
Don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, it’s hard for me to go home
Be so lonely

[Post-Chorus]
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely

[Bridge]
And I'm just an arrogant son of a bitch
Who can't admit when he's sorry

[Chorus]
Don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, it's hard for me to go home
Be so lonely

[Post-Chorus]
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely

[Verse 1]
Nine in the morning, the man drops his kids off at school
And he's thinking of you, like all of us do
Sends his assistant for coffee in the afternoon
Around 1:32, like he knows what to do

[Chorus]
She (She), she lives in daydreams with me (She)
She's the first one that I see, and I don't know why
I don't know who she is (She, she)

[Verse 2]
He takes a boat out, imagines just sailing away (Away, away)
And not telling his mates (Not telling his mates)
He wouldn't know what to say (Wouldn't know what to say, to say)

[Chorus]
She (She), she lives in daydreams with me (She)
She's the first one that I see, and I don't know why
I don't know who she is (She)
She (She), she's the first one that I see (She)
She lives in daydreams with me, and I don't know why
I don't know where she is (She, she)

[Bridge]
Lives for the memory
A woman who's just in his head (Just in his head)
And she sleeps in his bed (His bed)
While he plays pretend (Pretend)
So pretend (Pretend)

[Chorus]
She (She), she lives in daydreams with me (She)
She's the first one that I see, and I don't know why
I don't know who she is (She, she)
She (She), she's the first one that I see (She)
She lives in daydreams with me, and I don't know why
I don't know where she is (She, she)

[Guitar Solo]

[Intro]
Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good

[Verse 1]
I've got a good feeling
I'm just takin' it all in
Floating up and dreamin'
Droppin' into the deep end

[Pre-Chorus]
And if we're here long enough
They'll sing a song for us
And we'll belong

[Chorus]
Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good

[Verse 2]
Giving second chances
I don't need all the answers
Feeling good in my skin
I just keep on dancin'

[Pre-Chorus]
And if we're here long enough
We'll see it's all for us
And we'll belong

[Chorus]
Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good

[Bridge]
And it's just another day (And it's just another day)
And if our friends all pass away (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
It's okay (It's okay, it's okay)
It's okay (It's okay, it's okay, yeah)
Hey!
Here we go now

[Chorus]
Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good

[Outro]
All we ever want is automatic all the time
All we ever want is auto, auto all of the time
All we ever want is automatic all the time
All we ever want is auto, auto all of the time
Maybe, we can (All together now, one more time)
Find a place to feel good (Oh yeah)
And we can treat people with kindness (Just a little bit of kindness)
Find a place to feel good (Ow)

[Verse 1]
Put a price on emotion
I'm looking for something to buy
You've got my devotion
But man, I can hate you sometimes
I don't want to fight you
And I don't want to sleep in the dirt
We'll get the drinks in
So I'll get to thinking of her

[Chorus]
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line

[Verse 2]
Test of my patience
There's things that we'll never know
You sunshine, you temptress
My hand's at risk, I fold
Crisp trepidation
I'll try to shake this soon
Spreading you open
Is the only way of knowing you

[Chorus]
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright
We'll be alright
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright (Alright, alright, alright)

[Outro]
(We'll be alright)
(We'll be alright)
We'll be alright
We'll be alright
Oh
She's the only one around
And she's turning off the lights
And she's inside every crack
She's the only thing in sight

She's the only one I see
And she's flying through the air
She's the dust upon the sill
She's everywhere

And she's breaking up the line
And she's sitting in the rain
She's the trailer for a film
She's the curtain at the end

She's the sound of your own voice
She's someone else's drink
She's like living in the countryside
She's the whirlpool in the sink

She's a memory I recall
And she's waiting in the hall
She's the monster in the fridge
She's chewing cotton wool

[Verse 1]
Fear of what's in the mirror, yeah
So much to be afraid of
Scared of what we're made of
And what we might be
Young life flies out the window, yeah
It's not the time that changed us
It's the dreams that we weren't chasing
Come back to haunt us eventually

[Pre-Chorus]
That's why every morning, after dawning
Tell ya darling something is calling
Drive me crazy, I just can't explain it

[Chorus]
Go out of your mind (Out of your mind, out of your mind, out of your mind)
Go out of your mind (Out of your mind, out of your mind)

[Post-Chorus]
No, we can't rewind, life ain't no time machine
But once you free your mind, there's beauty in everything

[Pre-Chorus]
That's why every morning, after dawning
Tell ya darling something is calling
Drive me crazy, I just can't explain it

[Chorus]
Go out of your mind (Out of your mind, out of your mind, out of your mind)
Go out of your mind (Out of your mind, out of your mind)

[Post-Chorus]
No, we can't rewind, life ain't no time machine
But once you free your mind, there's beauty in everything

[Verse 1]
At Standing Rock the Jackboot Jump
You'd swear was all the rage
Whether tearing up old treaties
Or just tearing up the place
It's always corporate infrastructure
Over the structure of your face

[Verse 2]
In Moscow the Jackboot show
Has so much in store
For any silly student
Who doesn't wanna learn the score
So the Moscow Jackboot Ballet
Finds some scared young dancing floor

[Verse 3]
In Hong Kong it won't be long
'til they have to fall in line
For the long hand of Beijing
Stretches south a thousand miles
Where they rock the Jackboot Jump there
Like that shit's going out of style

[Verse 4]
All around the world
You'd think that things were looking rough
But the jackboot only jumps down
On people standing up
So you know good things are happening
When the jackboot needs to jump

[Intro]
Operation failure to launch

[Verse 1]
Operation failure to launch
Good vibrations, take what you want
Patiently wait where you are
I'm comin', I'm runnin' to you for eternity
Doctor, fix me up, I need awaken
Her eyes are closed, my dreams are vacant
Plans we made, they must go on
Don't be afraid, I won't be long

[Chorus]
My operation love
You hold me down, she picks me up
Don't let me drown
Into the clouds, I'll find my home
When I'm with her, I'm not alone

[Post-Chorus]
Occupation love (Oh-uh, oh-uh, oh)
Oh!
Occupation love (Oh-uh, oh-uh, oh)

[Verse 2]
Standing ovation, pledge to this nation
Dream of creation, what are we waiting for?
Yeah, time wasting
Reality with a few modified-cations, God behind Satan
I musta, musta saw faces
Hell's gonna come before it changes
(We) Obligated to tolerate the evil
Planet over-populated by the people
But I see you when you're disguised
You be keepin' it live
But I got you where I want you, I be deep in your mind (Yeah)
Love is among us and I'm seein' the signs
You too strong to move on and leave me behind (Yeah)
I love you, girl, you know that
I found peace inside you and I don't wanna go back

[Chorus]
My operation love
You hold me down, she picks me up
Don't let me drown
Into the clouds, I'll find my home
When I'm with her, I'm not alone

[Post-Chorus]
Occupation love (Oh-uh, oh-uh, oh)
Oh!
Occupation love (Oh-uh, oh-uh, oh)

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Tear me apart
Start with the heart
And let me bleed
I wanna bleed
Open me up
Pour out my guts
So you can feed
I'll let you feed

[Chorus]
There's something in me
Clawing at me
Just take it from me
Oh baby, feed, feed, feed, feed

[Verse 2]
Tear me apart
I don't want this heart
I wanna be
Set free
Open me up
Spill out my guts
So I can breathe
So I can breathe

[Chorus]
There's something in me
Clawing at me
Just take it from me
Oh baby, feed, feed, feed, feed
Feed, feed, feed, feed
Feed, feed, feed, feed
Feed, feed, feed, feed

[Chorus]
Psychedelics heal my brain
Marijuana for the migraine
Both hands to the wood grain
Drip candy paint and octane
On the black tar on the highway
A garage is a arcade
Two whips in the driveway
If I cop more gotta find space for it

[Verse 1]
Concentrate, say it, creep up into my space for it
Now I drip sauce like dry steak
Lookin' at a nigga sideways
Can't read 'em like my car plates
Car speed like my heart rate
Know I seem kinda irate
I just wanna see with my eyes straight
Got a blind date with a bad bitch from a dark place
On the highway to Hell in a i8 on the I-98
Never mind what they say
It's only all about what I think
They say drugs kill the brain cells
Guess I'ma boost the crime rate
Guess I gotta take time, fine
If I make mistake
I guess I gotta find the peace of mind like the last track on my tape

[Chorus]
Psychedelics help my brain
Marijuana for the migraine
Both hands to the wood grain
Drip candy paint and octane
On the black tar on the highway
Turn my garage to a arcade
Got two cars in the driveway
If I cop more gotta find space for it

[Verse 2]
Might board a private jet, aight, bet
Better yet, I'd rather fly commercial
Save a lot of money, less time, but patience is a virtue
Why you buy those new LVs from Virgil?
Boy, them pockets gonna hurt you
Why you so good to a ho, don't deserve you
The nerve, the nerve of you
No purple lean, just purple weed, shit got me on turtle
Homie sniffed a new eight ball, he evolved like Squirtle
Mix the pink with the Pikachu, if I sneeze, better say bless you
Don't picture me, just pinch of greens, psychedelic drugs in my vessel

[Chorus]
Psychedelics help my brain
Marijuana for the migraine
Both hands to the wood grain
Drip candy paint and octane
On the black tar on the highway
Turn my garage to a arcade
Got two cars in the driveway
If I cop more gotta find space for it

[Verse 3]
Need a IV, eyes burnin' like chlorine
Body like morphine, sip more lean, true story
Nigga, don't eat so he more lean
But codeine make you slump like a dope fiend, leanin'
Sweet dreams, now you fall asleep
Man, since you had the Sandman singin'
Molly dick, so I can't nut
Popped a Molly so I can't cum
X pill make the sex real
Adderall make my dick numb
Fuck

[Outro]
I'll try anything you want
Just to fix the things we've done
I'll try anything you want
Just to fix the things we've done
I'll try anything you want

[Intro]
Ah, G. Fresh

[Verse 1]
Wake up, psst, wake up
Money on the table, I'm able
Bought my mom her first car from Maaco
Now she on her third one and it's paid off
Gave money to her firstborn, no day off
I was tryna get to know a thing about you
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
You left me all alone
I was tryin' to fuck your bestie, yeah
Designer on my clothes in the closet
Yeah, designer on my hoes
Burberry, Prada, Gucci, Fendi (Yeah, yeah)
I'll wipe a nigga nose
Be responsible, lot to hold, yeah

[Verse 2]
I said I want her, hey
Your girl a goner, yeah
Check my persona
I was 'bout to throne her
And I hope it don't hurt
Bitch, I hope it don't hurt
She get on my nerves, she make me pull my arm
Voodoo Magnolia
And I would never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever
Ever, ever sell my soul for you

[Chorus]
You left me all alone
I was tryin' to fuck your bestie, yeah
Designer on my clothes in the closet
Yeah, designer on my hoes
Burberry, Prada, Gucci, Fendi
I'll wipe a nigga nose
Be responsible, lot to hold, yeah

[Verse 3]
You'll be mine, our time, bump and grind
Don't rush, make sweet love, one of us
Girl, I won't rush, I won't rush
Our time, our time
Sippin' Tuss and slowly moving, don't rush
Our time, our time

[Bridge]
Plough that pussy, plough that pussy (Ow)
Love it whishy, love it squishy (Ooh, ayy, ow)

Plough that pussy, plough that pussy (Ow)
Love it whishy, love it squishy (Ooh, ayy, ow)
And I love it squishy (Ooh, ayy)

[Chorus]
You left me all alone

[Verse 1]
Someday, I'm gonna live
In your house up on the hill
And when your skinhead neighbor goes missing
I'll plant a garden in the yard, then
They're gluing roses on a flatbed
You should see it, I mean thousands
I grew up here, 'til it all went up in flames
Except the notches in the door frame

[Chorus]
I don't know when you got taller
See our reflection in the water
Off a bridge at the Huntington
I hopped the fence when I was seventeen
Then I knew what I wanted

[Verse 2]
And when I grow up, I'm gonna look up
From my phone and see my life
And it's gonna be just like my recurring dream
I'm at the movies, I don't remember what I'm seeing
The screen turns into a tidal wave
Then it's a dorm room, like a hedge maze
And when I find you
You touch my leg, and I insist
But I wake up before we do it

[Chorus]
I don't know how, but I'm taller
It must be something in the water
Everything's growing in our garden
You don't have to know that it's haunted
The doctor put her hands over my liver
She told me my resentment's getting smaller
No, I'm not afraid of hard work
I get everything I want
I have everything I wanted

[Intro: Meek Mill]

Stunt so hard, uh, all of these chicks ain't flickin' my necklace
Look at the flick of the wrist and the way I put dick in a bitch on my checklist
I just got money, I'm throwin' away
Throwin' away and I'm blowin' away
But when they tell me that it's dough on the way
I will never put a hoe in the way
But I will put a four in the way
Just to see a nigga blow 'em away
You know what it is, you know it's a K
Shoot a nigga then I throw it away
Bust down, bust down, bust down
My whole team is touch down
CC wallet, touchdown
Ayy, fix your face, you might get a Benz
Ayy, just dumped my girl, I'm fuckin' all her friends

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Seasons changing
'Fore life start for me
'Fore life start for me
Thoughts and thoughts to me
Eighty degrees
Warmin' up to me
I did it free
I did know, indeed
And I run out to sea
I can walk on the water
Honey, I want you
I can float on the water
Father, hold me close
Don't let me down
I know you won't

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I chose not to be a slave
Dropped the Wave Runners, now we run the wave
Like we ain't had all the hood rats and mud rats
Like you ain't had 'em at good stats and all that
Nobody gon' ruin me
I just called my wife up, let's get Hoover free
I put all my ice up and my Louis V
I just copped my mom a crib, I'm back over East
Let me get your ear like Holyfield
From the home of Soldier Field
Coming home, that's how a soldier feels
All that killin' over, that's just overkill
Yeezy back in the Chi', this that Oprah field

[Chorus: Kanye West]
See this in 3D
'Fore life start for me
'Fore life start for me
Thoughts and thoughts to me
Eighty  degrees
Warmin' up to me
I did it free
I did know, indeed
And I run out to sea
I can walk on the water
Honey, I want you
I can float on the water
Father, hold me close
Don't let me down
I know you won't

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Woah, woah, yeah, yeah
Look, my life is exciting as Dennis Rodman's (Woah)
Stars intertwine, my soul back in alignment
If we don't have the same vision, no point in exchanging contact (No)
Only ex I love running into is at the end of my contracts, yeah
Bottom line, I'm seeing through the mask of the fakes
Like we're at the Comic Con, I point 'em out from time to time
Speaking of time, me and my mom been gettin' closer
Either I took her for granted or didn't know her
Or is it, I'm getting older?
Or is it, Luke is finally turning into Yoda?
Only new beginnings, no such thing as over
We should have just stayed friends
That never opened up or needed closure (God)
God, give me directions like Noah
I don't know some hopeless romantic shit
But I can't wait to see Ye get back with HOVA
Look bitch, this the new chain of command (Bitch)
Might bring the Pow chains back like me and Ye in Japan
Cudi back at it again, Push, yeah that's 'til the end, yeah
Just like it should have been
Nothing but that G.O.O.D. and the G around us
I knocked down the walls and my head free my mind up (Woah)
I didn't chase the game, ho, I helped redesign it, yeah
Goin' against us, you need logic, Muhammad
I'm so fuckin' conscious, that shit is my compass, yeah, yeah

So shorty, you gon' keep on talking
On my soul, on my life
You're the only one I run to your phone
Keep on calling, yeah
Shorty my woah kemosabe
You don't know nothing about it
And that's on bro, I been fighting on my own all my life
So shorty, you gon' keep on talking
On my soul, on my life
Yeah, you're the only one I run to your phone
Keep on calling, yeah

[Chorus]
I thought you was all mine, yeah
You said that you love me, but it's all lies, yeah
Shoulda known from when I looked in your eye
If I could erase you from my mind
Then I'd be alright, yeah, I'd be alright
You said you was all mine, yeah
You said that you love me, but it's all lies, yeah
Shoulda known from when I looked in your eye
If I could erase you from my mind
Then I'd be alright, yeah, I'd be alright

[Verse]
Shit ain't been the same since you left now
Only thing going through my head is regret now
Waiting for you, I almost let my bread down
You got me stressed out
Left me to get let down
But somehow I'm still wishin' you all the best now
I think it's better now
'Cause you really put my ego up in check now
And I'm upset now
Ever since you let me down
And I'm upset now

[Chorus]
'Cause I thought you was all mine, yeah
You said that you love me, but it's all lies, yeah
Shoulda known from when I looked in your eye
If I could erase you from my mind
Then I'd be alright, yeah, I'd be alright
You said you was all mine, yeah
You said that you love me, but it's all lies, yeah
Shoulda known from when I looked in your eye
If I could erase you from my mind
Then I'd be alright, yeah, I'd be alright

[Verse 1]
Cold was the night and hard was the ground
They found her in a small grove of trees
Lonesome was the place where Georgia was found
She's too young to be out on the street

[Chorus]
Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?

[Verse 2]
Ida said she couldn't keep Georgia from dropping out of school
I was doing the best that I could
But she kept runnin' away from this world
These children are so hard to raise good

[Chorus]
Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?

[Bridge]
Close your eyes and count to ten
I will go and hide but then be sure to find me
I want you to find me, and we'll play all over
We'll play all over
We'll play all over again

[Verse 3]
There's a toad in the witch grass, there's a crow in the corn
Wild flowers on a cross by the road
And somewhere a baby is crying for her mom
As the hills turn from green back to gold

[Chorus]
Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?
Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?

[Verse 1]
In a world gone wrong
How can I be strong?
Wonder of the world, power of the people

[Verse 2]
In a world of fright
How do I get it right?
Wonder of the world, power of the people

[Chorus]
And our world tonight
Is turn it right
With the strength of an eagle
Our world tonight
I see the light
Wonder of the world, power of the people

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

What's the matter with you?
Don't be sad

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, I'm from a place where the sun don't shine (Woo)
Mistakes that I made, do 'em one more time, uh
Outta space, I been up so high
So much hate in the world, but the love I find is worth it (Uh-huh)
And I ain't perfect, need a telescope just to find my purpose (Yeah)
I've been colorin' outside the lines (Lines)
I've been colorin' outside the lines (Woo)
And I need
A new car to come with a new house (Uh-huh)
Takin' it too far, what do I do now? (Uh-huh)
Baby, be cool, I'll
Pick you up when you down
You feelin' stuck, why don't you move on up?
Okay, my mind is dirty, my whiskey neat (Uh-huh)
Are you in a hurry? Are you in a dream? (Woo)
Be you, we can only be us (Us)
Little bit of love, shit, I don't need much (No, I don't need much)

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller & 

[?]]
It's going to get better, love (Be a little patient)

For life to go on (Be patient)

[Chorus: Mac Miller & 

[?], Mac Miller]
Just hold on, be strong, hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong, hold on, be strong (Yeah)
Hold on, be strong, hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong, hold on, be strong (Good mornin')

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah
Maximize the time you have to find the path
The smile hide behind the iron mask (Woo)
I'm alive, I'm alive and well
Will I die?  Only time will tell (Let's go)
Take a journey, find yourself a meanin'
Am I worthy? I am just a human bein'
Full of secrets, stupid dreams
I turn to miracles like turnin' steerin' wheels, I (I)
Prayed for a life like this (This)
Bunch of fake friends and a high-priced bitch
What the limelight is, I'll be fine
See my mind when I'm wind
I've been blind to the signs I miss
Yeah, I'm (I'm)
On my prime time shit
Don't even know where the sidelines is
Gotta little bit of weed and a sci-fi flick
Life a bitch, get her off of my dick (Three, two, one)
Motherfucker, goddamn

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller & 

[?]]
It's going to get better, love (Be a little patient)
Is around the corner (Be a little patient)

[Intro: Lil Juice]
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Got me feeling like the realest nigga on this earth (Yeah)
Tryna wash away my sins since I've been doin' dirt (Amen)
If I press a button on you, niggas goin' to church (Brr)
Load them thirties in them glizzies, niggas goin' to work (Work)

[Post-Chorus: Meek Mill]
When we slide, we slide, we slide, we slide, we slide (We slide)
And we slide, we slide, we slide, we slide, we slide (We slide)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Putting it in for all my dogs who never made it home
Spending nights all in the booth, and I done stayed alone
Tryna chase a hundred million, it won't take me long
When all these niggas went against me, it just made me strong
And I don't need nobody help, I do it by myself
Been taking risks before the fame, I keep it by my belt
Ain't have a dollar to my name, you don't know how I felt
So how the fuck could niggas judge me when you ain't never love me?
Going to war with niggas I grew up with, tryna slug me
Used to hug that corner every night, but it ain't hug me
Sipping on a quarter, huh, grimy, thirsty, hungry
Streets were my religion, left my mama for my homies
And we all slide, if he offsides
When they caught my homie slipping, it's like we all died
Think it brought us close together, that day, we all cried
Popping percs and sipping lean, and now we all high
Turned me savage, I got traumatized from homicides and all these caskets
Got me out my mind, can't go outside without that ladder
I grew up in failure where your dreams will get shattered
Bullets hit the window, all you seen was niggas scatter
It don't matter
Lost my daddy, kindergarten I got badder
When I was twelve, was living in hell and lighting that gas up
So 'bout my dawg know we gon' mask up

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Got me feeling like the realest nigga on this earth
Tryna wash away my sins 'cause I've been doin' dirt
If I press a button on you, niggas goin' to church
Load them thirties in them glizzies, niggas goin' to work

[Post-Chorus: Meek Mill, Young Thug & Both]
When we slide, we slide, we slide, we slide, we slide (We slide)
Yeah, yeah, we slide
We slide, we slide, we slide, we slide, we slide (We slide)
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
My codefendant said he can't take no time
Said call the police like Mary J. Blidge
The federales picked him up, this ain't no state time
I told him the safest way to talk is on the FaceTime, yeah
Slide in the the Lamborghini, slide in the Buick
Fish parquet, clean diamonds, no cubics
My brother down the road with a iPhone
Told him don't get used to that, you know I'm gettin' him back home
I cry still tears and don't know why, why
They poked his ribs, first they told him we gon' let it fly (Let it fly)
My mama told me let my pride stay to the side, but I had drunk it like a pint
I made a mistake and killed a player
Keep the Glock when I pray 'cause He won't save us (Yeah)
They let a rat kill my neighbor
If I had knew you hang with them I would've told my dawg do me a favor
We slide, we slide, we slide if it's slime
We slide, we both slide if it's slime
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sometimes I show people love so they won't kill me (Yeah)
Screaming on the mic, I'm tryna make baby feel me (Yeah)
Crosses on my chest, baguetti fingers heal me, yeah (Heal me)
I done got so wealthy, I done bought out my cavities
Black and white phantom, made the funeral referee

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Got me feeling like the realest nigga on this earth (Yeah)
Tryna wash away my sins since I've been doin' dirt (Amen)
If I press a button on you, niggas goin' to church (Brr)
Load them thirties in them glizzies, niggas goin' to work (Work)

[Post-Chorus: Meek Mill, Young Thug & Both]
When we slide, we slide, we slide, we slide, we slide (We slide)
Yeah, yeah, we slide
We slide, we slide, we slide, we slide, we slide (We slide)
Yeah, yeah, we slide

[Verse 1]
In the afternoon
Yellow curtains drawn
Designed with comfort in mind
Glowering into the night
Feel like letting go
The final resting place
The house cat knows when it's time
To enter another phase

[Chorus 1]
But you looked sad
In a reassuring way
And I don't want to leave
So we can both be the same

[Verse 2]
In the afternoon
Modern sovereignty
The sunlight stopped coming through
And we lost the game
Brains like nesting dolls
Plotting their escape
The doorman sees you're alone
He can't seem to find your name

[Chorus 2]
But you, my friend
Know problems can't be solved
They don't understand
That somehow it's all the same
And somehow it's all the same
And somehow it's all the same
And somehow it's all the same

[Outro]
Relief is like candy
The sweetest kind of love
Who'd guess that I'd feel this way?
Like a kid in a candy store
A kid in a candy store
A kid in a candy store
A kid in a candy store
A kid in a candy store
A kid in a candy store
A kid in a candy store
A kid in a candy store

[Verse 1]
My guy pretty like a girl
And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimmin' laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
12 treat a nigga like he twelve
How you lookin' up to me and talkin' down? (Yeah)
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)
God level, I am the I am (Woah)
Now film it with that drone cam, in the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick, Noé, up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back, yes, the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Rollin' when you ride, poppin'
Rollin' when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight actin'
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016: burnt some discs (Dope)
2017: ideas playin' off a Walkman
This a cult, not a clique on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
That's a double edge, "issa knife" (Knife)
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fightin' (Fightin')
Revenge in the air make my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick (Yeah)
Clips on clips like Mike (Hello)
It's really all

[Chorus]
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

[Bridge]
It's really you on my mind
It's really you on my mind
It's really you
It's really you on my mind

[Verse 2]
V both sides of the 12
Steam both sides of the L
Freeze smoke rings and they hail
Sleet snow grind for the wealth
Whole team diamonds is real
Showed 'em how to shine by theirselves
You need a cosign for your health
I need that bitch to grind on my belt
I know you need to try for my belt
I know you seen it drivin' itself
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale
But it's stealth

[Chorus]
I see both sides like Chanel
I see both sides like Chanel

[Outro]
My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards
I got new money, and it's all cash
I got new bags, and they all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
(I mean my baby bi)
Amazing, the cash online unknown
(I mean my baby bi)
Blazin' the dash, countin' money at home
My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards
I got new money, and it's all cash
I got new bags, and they all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
(I mean my baby bi)
Amazing, the cash online unknown
(I mean my baby bi)
Blazin' the dash, countin' money at home

[Verse 1]
We’re thankful for You
And Your word has come and changed our lives
And I learned to know You
For Your word is water giving life
‘Cuz we drowned in You and we won’t pull through
Without You by our side

[Chorus]
He gave his life to give
Eternal life to you
A sacrifice so real
Soul body heart and mind
Now we can go on
Knowing He is living in our soul
So we give our all, for His love, His life

[Verse 1]

[Intro]
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, ring, ring, ring
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, ring, ring, ring
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, ring, ring, ring
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, ring, ring

[Verse]
Welcome to reality
It's either this or your fatality
I am gravity, I am your majesty
I'm the truth and that's a reason that you mad at me
I'm the source of all your power, I'm your battery
I can either be the end or be your masterpiece
I can either be a friend or be a casualty
I am your addiction, you are attached to me
You try to run away, but always comin' back to me
Good and evil, I am duality
I'm the creator, I am God inside his factory
I'm blasphemy, I'm standin' on the edge
And there ain't a place I'd rather be
Yeah, you have a dream, you have a dream
But if you not ready to wake up, then go back to sleep
Open up your eyes, yeah, you have to see
Fuck rulin' the world, I want the galaxy

[Chorus]
It's time to wake up (Wake up, wake up, wake up)
Good mornin' (Wake up, wake up)
Good mornin', motherfucker (Wake up, wake up, wake up)
It's time to wake up (Wake up, wake up, wake up)
Good mornin'  (Wake up, wake up)
Good mornin', motherfucker (Wake up, wake up, wake up)
It's time to wake up (Wake up, wake up, wake up)
Good mornin' (Wake up, wake up)
Good mornin', motherfucker (Wake up, wake up, wake up)
It's time to wake up (Wake up, wake up, wake up)
Good mornin' (Wake up, wake up, wake up)

[Verse 1]
I'd give the world to her
As long as my heart's still beating
As long as she's next to me
As long as this love's still fleeting

[Chorus]
Because I like her

[Verse 2]
I'd kill in cold blood
I'd draw my own blood
As long as she's there beside me
Life could feel so good

[Chorus]
Because I like her

[Bridge]
Could it be make-believe?
Am I just walking through a dream?
Haven't felt this way in
Such a long time, I do believe

[Chorus]
That I like her
So I just wanted to say something real quick, which is yesterday I was at Kimmel, which was amazing, and when I left I had to go to a rehearsal. So to walk to the car, there was an alley that I walked through. Like 500 feet to my left was a group of fans, and then like 500 feet to my right was what I thought was fans and paparazzi.

I started, I went to the left side. I walked all the way over to them and hugged them all, I took pictures and talked to them for a second. Didn't sign anything, because I like don't do that. That's something I don't do, because I used to and I realised all anyone did was sell everything that I signed so I stopped doing that. It's kind of a policy of mine that I don't.

So I talked to them, hugged them all, I went to the other side and as I got closer, like they were cheering for me and stuff, and shouting for my name and stuff, and so I walked.

And as I got closer, I kind of realised that it was pretty much all paparazzi and ebayers, which is what we call people that just take my signature and sell it and couldn't give less of a fuck about me at all.

But I didn't want to like be disrespectful at all, so I went up to them all and I like tried to get like hugs and try to touch all of their hands like do that down the line or whatever, and I started to do that. Nobody put their hands out. Nobody tried to hug me back...I hugged one girl at the end, and so she was really sweet...

But then I tried to walk like a couple feet across from where they were, not where the first group was, but like in the same area that I was in, because I thought that's where there were fans.

When I looked over there, they were gone. And I was like, OK well, I guess nobody here really wants anything from me besides a fucking autograph, which I don't do because these bitches will sell that shit.

Like, I'll sign something if it's like for a special occasion or if somebody's in need or whatever, of course I'm gonna do that. But I have this whole thing about not signing things because I just want to be there. I'd way rather get a hug and talk to you than take a picture with you and fucking sign something so you can sell that shit.

I don't do that, and I've tried to make that clear like a billion times,  and I said it before I went over to them.

Anyway.

I started to walk away, because I realised none of these people actually cared about anything that had to do with me as a person. Um, and so I walked away.
As I started to walk away back to the car, they all started to boo me.

And then they all started calling me a little bitch, and saying I'm gonna lose my Grammy nominations, and you know, what a little fucking you know, whatever, just cursing me out and shit.

Damn, dude, like...

Then I started hearing them comparing, they kept being like, "Lorde would have stopped". I'm like, I did stop! I walked 500 fe- I walked like 1,000 feet to come say hi to you and give some hugs and y'all are booing me and calling me a little bitch?

Like, the fact that people can switch up like that 

[clicks fingers]...damn. Like wait outside for you, and then immediately they don't get what they want, and they boo you and fucking curse at you.

I'm like, "Bro, I'm 17! You're ..." Oh my God, this shit is...

[exasperated whoo!]! I turned around ready to fucking pounce, and then I got told to just ignore it and not give a reaction, which is probably good, and it's probably stupid dumb of me making these videos but...

Mm...anyway, the only reason I'm making this video is because I saw a video of this all happening and I just wanted to clarify what actually happened. Because if you watch the video it literally looks like I'm watching by a bunch of fans and like completely ignoring them and not saying hi to them, which is not at all what happened.

I literally walked from the other side of the alley, which was like 1,000 feet. Which is fine, I'm like happy to do it. But I walked over there literally only to say hi, only to hug people. I literally went over and I was like, "I don't want pictures, I want to hug", and I got pictures of me shoved into my fucking face. And no love whatsoever.

So I left and then I got booed and got called a little bitch and got told that I'm gonna lose my Grammys.

I probably am gonna lose the Grammys, but it's okay though! I'm not worried about that, it's the nomination that counts!

Anyway! I don't know, I just wanted to, I don't even know...I went back to the other side where the real fans were and I was like, "Guys they booed me!" And they were very sweet. You guys are my friends, I love you a lot.

And to the grown men that booed me and called me a little bitch, I hope the best for you. I hope you can find someone else you can use to make money off of and belittle. So yeah, all the best!

Love you paparazzi.

You know I still want you, 'cause you know (Ayy, yeah)
You used to need me (Ayy, yeah)
Do you believe me? (Ayy, yeah)
You used to want me (Ayy, yeah)
You used to

[Chorus]
'Cause I know that you, you been
Out there touchin' on someone else
I know that you been, out there touchin'
What do I do? I still want you
I just can't lose, I guess there only one I can do

[Bridge]
So I let you do you, if I wanna keep you I gotta lose you
So I let you do you, 'cause it feels like I might lose you
So I let you do you, ooh, I let you do you
I let you do you, ooh, I'ma let you do you

[Verse 2]
And don't think I don't know what's goin' in

But you the one I been tryna' run to
And don't think I don't know you're going strong
You used to be mine when I come through
Now you tryna find you some dude

[Chorus]
I heard you've been out there fuckin' on someone else
I heard you've been out there fuckin' on someone else
I know you've been out there touchin' on someone else
I know you don't give me what you used to

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
The city's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

[Bridge]
I'm just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)
I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (Ooh)

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Outro]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch

[Intro]
Young Metro, young Metro, young Metro (Sheesh)
Ayy (Ayy)
Young Metro, young Metro

[Verse 1]
Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need (Bitch need)
Tryna find the one that can fix me
I've been dodgin' death in the six-speed
Amphetamine got my stummy feelin' sickly
Yeah, I want it all now
I've been runnin' through the pussy, need a dog pound
Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound
Tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down

[Chorus]
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

[Verse 2]
Said I'm heartless
So much pussy, it be fallin' out the pocket
Metro Boomin turn this ho into a moshpit
Tesla pill got me flyin' like a cockpit
Yeah, I got her watchin'
Call me up, turn that pussy to a faucet
Duffle bags full of drugs and a rocket
Stix drunk, but he never miss a target
Photoshoots, I'm a star now (Star)
I'm talkin' Time, Rolling Stone, and Bazaar now (Bazaar now)
Sellin' dreams to these girls with their guard down (What?)
Seven years, I've been swimmin' with the sharks now

[Chorus]
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

[Bridge]
I lost my heart and my mind
I try to always do right
I thought I lost you this time
You just came back in my life
You never gave up on me (Why don't you?)
I'll never know what you see (Why won't you?)
I don't do well when alone (Oh yeah)
You hear it clear in my tone

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm heartless (Ooh)
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover
I was a stumble bummin' down the neon Music City sidewalks
With the Junkie and the Juicehead who had problems of their own
Stuck with luck it kept me standin’ just a step away from starvin'
And the talent that I swore I'd show before I’d go back home

Ninety days I looked the army makin' neither love nor money
And my only set of clothes was gettin' closer to the bone
And the Junkie placed an order with the Prophet on the corner
And he told him of the soul that he'd been sellin' for a song
He said my future was my fortune but I let it slip away
Slowly smokin' myself broke on eighty cigarettes a day
Findin' out that crime ain't all there is that doesn’t pay
And writin’ words that no one's gonna see but did you said it who said it

I can read my fortune in the bottom of a glass
And I can see it’s time for me to make my last request
Won't you fill my grave with whiskey when I'm laid away to rest
So the boys can say I drank myself to dead

Well I drank the whole thing over puttin' one and two together
And it added up to more of what I didn’t want to be
I ain't blamin' Music City but it's only gonna see me
One more day and the wake up and the time it takes to leave
'Cause I got a dirty picture of what could have been my future
In a Prophet pushin' day dreams on a corner for a fee

And the wino lookin' lonely at a bottle gettin' empty
And a hungry lookin' junkie huntin' tea in sympathy
And I bet that junkie's laughin' after the life he threw away
Slowly smokin' himself broke on eighty cigarettes a day
Pleadin' down the Prophet to a price that he can pay
And writin' words that no one's gonna see but did you said it who said it

Every empty bottle is my private crystal ball
And starin' into the future findin' nothin' there at all
Which is what I'll miss tomorrow when the neon shadows fall
On the Junkie and the Juicehead minus me
Got a song about the sister waitin' somewhere by the phone
For some man who never missed her ever since he come and gone
Ain't it's harder for a woman with a baby on her way
That's the price of being human when you're poor enough to pay
And she listen to the freedom in the silence at her door
No one missin' when you need 'em there ain't no fun to sing that song no more
Got a song about a saviour looking lonesome and afraid
At a city full of strangers and a cross he never made
And he's sadder than he's wiser and a longer way from home
And he wonders why his father left him bleeding and alone
Just a broken song of freedom and the closing of a door
No one's missin' 'til you need 'em there ain't no fun to sing that song no more
Just a broken song
High on the mountain what do I see
There's bear tracks bear tracks lookin' back at me
You better get your rifle boys before it's too late
That bear's got a little pig and headed for the gate

He's bigger around the middle and he's broad across the rump
Runnin' ninety miles an hour takin' forty feet jumps
Ain't never been caught he ain't never been treat
Some folks say he looks a lot like me

Well I got me some money and I got me some bees
And they started makin' honey way up in the trees
I chopped down the trees cause my honey's all gone
Old Slew foot's done made himself at home

He's bigger around the middle and he's broad across the rump
Runnin' ninety miles an hour takin' forty feet jumps
Ain't never been caught he ain't never been treat
Some folks say he looks a lot like me
Some folks say he looks a lot like daddy
Winter's comin' on and it's forty below
The river's frozen over so where can he go
I'd get me a rifle boys and run him in the well
Then I shoot him in the bottom just to hear him yell

He's bigger around the middle and he's broad across the rump
Runnin' ninety miles an hour takin' forty feet jumps
Ain't never been caught he ain't never been treat
Some folks say he looks a lot like me
Some folks say he looks a lot like my Johnny

[Verse 1]
Although many contend
You can find hope ascend
To mark just how everything changes
Be it the temperature highs
Or the sea level rising
It's all going up but the wages

And murdered reporters
And talk of hard borders
Sky-bound as a heavenly choir
Or the stock price in Boeing
The screams of the dying
Or the skies over Yemen last night

[Chorus]
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time

[Verse 2]
Don't mention the rent
Or the money that's spent
Keeping the banks in good health
Or ridiculous claims
Or the level of blame
Pointed to anything else

And preachy musicians
And those stuck in prisons
With scarcely enough for a blunt
Or the pressure of blood
That new hotel in the hood
With an oligarch's name on the front

[Chorus]
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up with the bump in the heating bills
Even though the city's on fire
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time

[Bridge]
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher

[Chorus]
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up with the bump in the heating bills
Even though the city's on fire
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
(don't) fuck up the vibe
(don't) go through my phone, (don't) you make me lie
We only look better when we don't got to try
Girl you look better when you don't got to try

[Chorus]
Real niggas still in style
Real women still in style
Fake hoes out of style...

[Verse 1]
I found a guy, told me I was a star
He held the door, held my hand in the dark
And he's perfect on paper, but he's lying to my face
Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?

[Verse 2]
And there's one more boy, he's from my past
We fell in love, but it didn't last
'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway
And I say that I'm through, but this song's still for you

[Chorus]
All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me?
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best, but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day
But shouldn't that be enough for me?

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
And I miss the days when I was young and naive
I thought the perfect guy would come and find me
Now happy ever after, it don't come so easily

[Chorus]
All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me? Oh, ooh
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day
And all I want is for that to be okay

[Intro: The Man]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man, I'd be the man, yeah
'Cause I'd be the man, I'd be the man

[Verse 1: Love Story]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello", little did I know

[Pre-Chorus 1: Love Story]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "please don't go," and I said

[Chorus 1: Love Story]
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby, just say, 'Yes'"

[Verse 2: I Knew You Were Trouble]
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

[Pre-Chorus 2: I Knew You Were Trouble]
And he's long gone, when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

[Chorus 2: I Knew You Were Trouble]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

[Post-Chorus 1: I Knew You Were Trouble]
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble

[Bridge 1: I Knew You Were Trouble]
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah

[Chorus 2: I Knew You Were Trouble]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there, knew it right there)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Verse 3: Blank Space]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
"Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus 3: Blank Space]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Bridge 2: Blank Space]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

[Verse 4: Shake It Off (With Taylor Swift & Halsey)]
I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, mm, mm
That's what people say, mm, mm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mm, mm
That's what people say, mm, mm

[Pre-Chorus 2: Shake It Off (Sang by Camila Cabello)]
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Saying it's gonna be alright

[Chorus 4: Shake It Off (Sang by Taylor Swift, Halsey & Camila Cabello)]
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

[Bridge 2: Shake It Off]
Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars
And the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You could've been getting down
To this sick beat
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like, "Oh my God," but I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Why don't you come on over, baby?
We can shake, shake, shake
Yeah, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus 4: Shake It Off (Sang by Taylor Swift, Halsey & Camila Cabello)]
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (Haters gonna hate)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

[Post-Chorus 2: Shake It Off (Sang by Taylor Swift, Halsey & Camila Cabello)]
I Shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

[Verse 5: Lover]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

[Chorus 5: Lover]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, and
Ah, take me out, take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Bridge 3: Lover]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed, yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus 5: Lover]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, and
Take me out, take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Oh, darlin', you're my, my, my, my
Lover

[Intro: Jacob Collier]
Two, three, four, five

[Verse 1: Daniel Caesar & Jacob Collier]
If you wanna get sunshine (All night)
Walkin' on the rooftop (Moonlight)
I'ma go get some
Time alone with you (Ah-ooh)
We could go dancing (All night)
Soak up the disco (Moonlight)
I dig it when I get that
Time alone with you

[Chorus: Jacob Collier, Both]
It's a beautiful Sunday morning
You see the sun up in the sky
It's gonna shine on you
(When I'm alone with you)

[Verse 2: Daniel Caesar & Jacob Collier]
If you wanna get dirty (All night)
Slippin' on the mudslide (Moonlight)
We could cut the chit chat (Gimme that)
Time alone with you (Oh yeah)
We could skip the border (All night)
Swim around the ocean (Moonlight)
Man, the octopus like when you give me that
Time alone with you (Ah-ooh)

[Chorus: Jacob Collier, Both]
It's a beautiful Sunday evening
And when you see that little moon
You know I'm gonna let it shine on you
Open up the sky, and let the groove fall down
(When I'm alone with you)
Take you down in the sunshine
(When I'm alone with you)
It's gonna shine on you

[Verse 3: Daniel Caesar, Both]
All night, starbright
Shines down on me
It's all good, it's alright
You're all I see
At times, we may find
Our hearts grow heavy
It's all good, it's alright
You're all I need

[Verse 4: Daniel Caesar, Jacob Collier, Both]
I know you wanna
Make it to nirvana
Lay all day in bed with me
And teach me how to love ya (Teach me how to love ya)
You wanna be my partner
Well, baby, please believe me
Loving me ain't easy
I'ma need some time with you (Ooh yeah)
You gon' need some time with me
Who knows what we're gonna do (Ooh yeah)
All I hope is you don't leave

[Verse 5: Daniel Caesar, Both]
All night, starbright (All night)
Shines down on me (I'ma need some time with you)
It's all good, it's alright  (It's alright)
You're all I see  (You gon' need some time with me)
At times we may find  (May find)
Hearts grow heavy  (Heart's been growing heavy, yeah)
It's all good, it's alright
You're all I need  (All I hope is you don't leave)

[Verse 6: Jacob Collier, Both]
Who's that?
The most beautiful girl in the whole wide world
And she's mine, all mine
And I want her to know that my feelings show
I need time
(Gimme time alone with you)
The most beautiful girl in the whole wide world
And she's mine, all mine
And I want her to know that my feelings show
I need time
(Gimme time alone with you)
The most beautiful girl in the whole wide world
And she's mine, all mine
And I want her to know that my feelings show
I need time
(Gimme time alone with you)

[Verse 7: Daniel Caesar, Jacob Collier, Both]
All you wanna get's sunshine (All night)
Walkin' on the rooftop (Moonlight)
We could cut the chit chat (All night)
I dig it when I get that (Moonlight)
I'ma go get some
Time alone with you
Time alone with you
Time alone with you

[Spoken Intro: Kacey Musgraves & James Corden]
Hey James. Oh hey Kacey.  How ya doin'?
I'm good, but have you seen the weather outside?
It's snowing really hard, I wonder if it's gonna stop
I'll tell you one thing
As long as we're both nice and warm inside
It can snow out there as much as it likes
That's really true
It's really true
It's so true
It's so true
So true

[Verse 1]
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Interlude: James Corden & Kacey Musgraves]
Oh my gosh
Sorry
Yeah, no, yeah
Should we-
No, let's just-
Okay
We'll-
Okay

[Verse 2]
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Interlude: James Corden & Kacey Musgraves]
I don't believe it! Oh my God, do you want me to help you?
No, I'm fine
Okay
Oh, I'm so s-, I gotta get that fixed. Is this, is this, you really do
I need to call the handyman. Do you know what? Maybe we should just, we'll um, you know, we'll, we'll move-
Let's move away, this way. We should go, we should go over here
Yeah, okay, um. Okay, you ready?
Okay
Okay

[Verse 3]
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

[Interlude: James Corden & Kacey Musgraves]
Oh my God!
Go away, no you-
This your house?
Yes it is, yes, awkward. Get a refund! I'm so sorry, um- Okay, okay, yeah. Wow, what's, that's crazy, okay
Okay, let's just move away from the-
Okay, you ready?
Yeah
Okay, it's snow so it'll dissolve in your mouth. I got a, I got some, it's in there
It's okay?
It's okay
Good, 'cause here we go

[Verse 4]
Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbye-ing
(But) As long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow

[Interlude: James Corden & Kacey Musgraves]
My God, oh
You okay? You, are you okay?
I'm fine, are you good?
Yeah
You okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, let's-
Let's pick it up again and we'll carry on
Okay

[Verse 5]
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm (Crazy storm)
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

[Interlude: James Corden]
Okay, okay
Yes
Alright
Okay

[Verse 6]
Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it
Snow
Oh, come on!

[Outro]
Alright, thank you for being very nice, stand by

[Skit: Kacey Musgraves & Leon Bridges]
Leon Bridges! (Yo)
Come on in (Good to see you, good to see you)
Hey! Thanks for coming
Thanks for having me (Okay)
Honestly, I have nothing ready for Christmas
I didn't know you were coming
Hey, don't sweat it, I'm just here to sing a song

[Verse 1: Kacey Musgraves]
We've been moving too fast and we should slow down
Come and sit by the fire, stop rushing around
'Cause this time of year, it's meant for two
So don't leave me lonely if I don't have you

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves]
The holiday's just another day that's cold
Standing all alone under the mistletoe
I don't feel the cheer, ooh, without you here
There's no red and white stripes on a candy cane
Silent Night just wouldn't sound the same
Where'd the magic go?
All I know is me without you is like a present without a bow

[Interlude: Kacey Musgraves]
Hoo hoo

[Verse 2: Leon Bridges]
Before we know, the wreath will come down
The halls won't be decked, there'll be no snow on the ground
The new year will come and bring lots of change, baby
And if I'm not with you, girl, sippin' on champagne

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves & Leon Bridges, Kacey Musgraves]
The holiday's just another day that's cold
Standing all alone under the mistletoe
I don't feel the cheer, ooh, without you here
There's no red and white stripes on a candy cane
And Silent Night just wouldn't sound the same
Where'd the magic go?
All I know is me without you is like a present without a bow

[Interlude: Kacey Musgraves & Leon Bridges]
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, hmm

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves with Leon Bridges]
The holiday's just another day that's cold
Standing all alone under the mistletoe
I don't feel the cheer, ooh, without you here
There's no red and white stripes on a candy cane
And Silent Night just wouldn't sound the same
Where'd the magic go?
All I know is me without you is like a present without a bow

[Interlude: Kacey Musgraves & Leon Bridges]
Hmm
Me without you is like a present without a bow, girl, yeah
Come sit by the fire (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves]
Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say
On a bright Hawaiian Christmas Day
That's the island greeting that we send to you
From the land where palm trees sway
Here we know that Christmas will be green and bright
The sun will shine by day and all the stars at night
Mele Kalikimaka is Hawaii's way to say merry Christmas to you

[Interlude: Kacey Musgraves & Zooey Deschanel]
Zooey Deschanel! Good to meet you, hi!
How are you?
I'm-I'm good! How are you?
What are we doing?
A-a Christmas special
Oh.​

[Chorus: Zooey Deschanel]
Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say
On a bright Hawaiian Christmas day
That's the island greeting that we send to you
From the land where palm trees sway
Here we know that Christmas will be green and bright
The sun will shine by day and all the stars at night
Mele Kalikimaka is Hawaii's way to say merry Christmas to you

[Interlude: Kacey Musgraves, Zooey Deschanel, Kacey Musgraves & Zooey Deschanel]
Ooh! Yes!
I know who that's for.​​

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves, Zooey Deschanel, Kacey Musgraves & Zooey Deschanel]
Mele Kalikimaka is Hawaii's way to say merry Christmas to you
Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say
On a bright Hawaiian Christmas Day
That's the island greeting that we send to you
From the land where palm trees sway
Here we know that Christmas will be green and bright
The sun will shine by day and all the stars at night
Mele Kalikimaka is Hawaii's way to say Merry Christmas
Merry, merry Christmas
To say merry Christmas to you

[Verse: Big Sean]
...my body, my physique
Told my peeps, told 'em all, "It's time to eat" (Hmm)
No, no please, can't, no don't do that, we want peace
They'll run around, touchin' on me, playin', they like to leach
Yeah I don't own trees, I pay dues with no receipts
I got you and ain't no pleasin', lay they life down for the cause
I got blue ones goin' hard, I got heart

[Verse 1]
Two shot the diligence

[Bridge]
I slide on my hater like skrrt (woah, woah, woah)
I’m killing this shit don’t get murked (woah, woah, woah)

[Verse 2]
Two shot the diligence
No more reminiscing on who shot, we finish it
Blade runner, walking on thin ice, admit it is
Hot feet running, I been nice, I’m it, legit

[Intro]
It feels like we're supposed to be happy during the holidays
But, sometimes they just make you really sad
So, I wrote this song for anybody that might be feeling a little bit lonely

[Verse 1]
It's all red and gold and Nat King Cole and tinsel on the tree
It's all twinkle lights and snowy nights and the kids still believe

[Refrain]
And I know that they say, "Have a happy holiday"
And every year, I sincerely try
Oh, but Christmas, it always makes me cry

[Verse 2]
It's the ones we miss, no one to kiss under the mistletoe
Another year gone by, just one more that I, I couldn't make it home

[Refrain]
And I know that they say, "Have a happy holiday"
And every year, I swear, I sincerely try
Oh, but Christmas, it always makes me cry
Always

[Verse 3]
It seems like everybody else is having fun
I wonder if I'm the only one
Who's broken heart still has broken parts just wrapped in pretty paper
And it's always sad seeing mom and dad getting a little grayer

[Refrain]
And they always say, "Have a happy holiday"
And every year, I swear, I sincerely try
Oh, but Christmas, it always makes me cry
Always

[Intro]
One, two, three, four
Hey, everybody
Thank you so much for watching the show
This has been so much fun
Have a wonderful new year, happy holidays

[Chorus]
Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love

[Verse 1]
Don't get me wrong, a shiny new Mercedes would look nice in my driveway
Or a roundtrip ticket for a long vacation on a big fancy jet plane

[Pre-Chorus]
There's only one thing that I want
Baby, it's hard to find and it's already mine, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, I don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can wrap me up
In ribbons and bows to cure my woes
'Cause I just need your love

[Verse 2]
All the ladies down at the hair salon are gonna brag about what they got
They'll walk in drippin' in their bobbles and trinkets and their whosits and whatnots

[Pre-Chorus]
There's only one thing that I want
Baby, it's hard to find and it's already mine

[Chorus]
Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, I don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can wrap me up
In ribbons and bows to cure my woes
'Cause I just need your love

[Bridge]
Oh, I, I, I just need your love
I, I, I just need your love

[Chorus]
Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, I don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can wrap me up
In ribbons and bows to cure my woes
'Cause I just need your love, yeah

[Outro]
Just need your love
Just need your love

[Pre-Chorus]
All of the studios
Cut off the lights
Persuasive invasion, that could cost our life
Head in the clouds but my vision alright
Looking though fog, yeah my head at the night
Audio cardio, I jog your brain
Just like I'm Kanye, they think I’m insane
Look up to God and he calling my name
How can I handle the faith and the fame

[Intro]
I can't make you dance, I can't make you dance
I can't make you dance, I can't make you dance
I can't make you dance, I can't make you dance

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
I didn't come here to stand around, I came to get down
Tell the DJ blast that sound, vibrate the ground
Motherfucker just turn it up loud as fuck
Hit me with music (Music) and I won't go (Dance)
Make me dance, stand in the B-boy stands (Dance)
Electro got me moving, call up the ambulance (Dance)
I can't stop grovin', I'm in a trance (Dance)
It's beyond beyond, settle down, better make me dance

[Chorus]
I can make you dance if you want me to
I can make you dance if you want me to
I can make you dance if you want me to
Dance

[Refrain]
It'll make you dance
It'll make you dance
It'll make you dance
Make you dance
Make you dance
It'll make you dance
Ooh, make you dance

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
Come on DJ go and drop it, move that body to the sound
Everybody that's the topic, get their feet up off the ground
Jump up and down to the music, get into it, do it now
Ain't got time to waste, this ain't the place for you to stand around
Dance, (Party people) move your body to the beat
Dance, (Party people) rock your body, move your feet
Dance, (Party people) move your body to the beat
Dance, (Party people) rock your body, move your feet

[Chorus]
I can make you dance if you want me to
I can make you dance if you want me to
I can make you dance if you want me to
Dance

[Refrain]
It'll make you dance
It'll make you dance
It'll make you dance
Make you dance
Make you dance
It'll make you dance
Ooh, make you dance

[Bridge]
I can make you dance if you want me to
I can make you dance
Dance
Dance

[Outro]
I can't make you dance, I can't make you dance
I can't make you dance, I can't make you dance
I can't make you dance, I can't make you dance
I can't make you dance, I can't make you dance
I can't make you dance, I can't make you dance
I can't make you dance, I can't make you dance
I can't make you dance, I can't make you dance
I can't make you dance, I can't make you dance
Hook]
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

[Verse 1]
Warning, this shit's gon' be rated R, restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self-inflicted
Doctor slapped my momma, "Bitch, you got a sick kid"
Arrested, molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
'Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
(Murder-murder, redrum)
Brain size of a bread crumb
Which drug will I end up dead from?
Inebriated 'til my stress is alleviated
"How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?"
Illiterate, illegitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out (RRRAH!), killed the bitch and did her
Used to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was littler
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fucking Bette Midler
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler, didn't ya?
Bring your bitch, I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her

[Hook]
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

[Verse 2]
I lace tunes, that's out this world like space moons
With a bunch crazed loons dismissin' brains like graze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
Doing whippets, passed out like sampler snippets
Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
I'ma let your grandpa hit it
Lace it up with cocaine so he can't forget it
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the rum
Or any alcoholic beverage, losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage, smoked out like Eckrich
Dandruff's making my neck itch, what the fuck? Give me the check bitch
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
Slap dips, support domestic violence
Beat your bitch's ass while your kids stare in silence
I'm just joking, is Outsidaz really dust smoking?
If all your shit's missing, then probably one of us broke in

[Hook]
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

[Verse 3]
My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling
Blitzin' like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game, put the second string in
This Brandy got me swinging, bobbing back and forth like a penguin (Allah, Allah)
Delinquent, choking microphones with broken English
Make your mama be like "Whoo, this is good! Who sings this?"
"Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I dug it
It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit"
It was predicted by a medic, I'd grow
To be an addicted diabetic, living on liquid Triaminic
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing
Panicking, I think I might have just took too much Anacin
Frozen mannequin, posin' stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying, God is that you?
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for an IV
Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip hop
They say that's where it lives
The closest they gon' come is 2Pac
It's politics, it's all a fix
Set up for these white blue-collared hicks
It's to make a dollar off of black music
With a subliminal ball of tricks
For those who kiss ass and swallow dicks

[Hook]
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

[Verse 1]
Las Vegas, sorcerers and sages
And the lights turn, turn dark like pages
And Manhattan, demons and dragons
I'm up in the air, where anything can happen
And the city, us and the others
And the city, us and the others

[Chorus]
Oo-oo-oh I can do this on my own
And oo-oo-oo-oh you know when I am gone
All the places I can go
All the people I will meet
Oo-oo-oh
That don't feel like home to me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Seattle, where all the people battle
If the rain pours and bodies wash upon the shore
And Jackson, I walk around without a soul
I lost myself in the museum of rock & roll
And the city, us and the others
And the city, us and the others

[Chorus]
Oo-oo-oh I can do this on my own
And oo-oo-oo-oh you know when I am gone
All the places I can go
All the people I will meet
Oo-oo-oh
That don't feel like home to me

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Eldorado, city made of solid gold
Doesn't matter to you all that I left home
I know I've been gone for a while
For a while
For a while
For a while
For a while
For a while
For a while
For a while
For a while

[Chorus]
Oo-oo-oh I can do this on my own
And oo-oo-oo-oh you know when I am gone
All the places I can go
All the people I will meet
Oo-oo-oh
That don't feel like home to me
Oo-oo-oh I can do this on my own
And oo-oo-oo-oh it's been a while since I've been gone
All the places I have been
All the people I have met
Oo-oo-oh
I find myself back home again
Oo-oo-oh
On the island of Stromboli
Recklessly, I gave my heart
On the island of Stromboli
Every dream I own had its start

If you tell me it was madness
I can only shrug and sigh
If you ask me for a reason
I can't tell you why

It wasn't the moonlight
For there wasn't a moon
No violins were playing
Yet our heart strings were in tune

How can I forget Stromboli?
How can I begin to try?
Tell me I'll regret Stromboli
I'll say what care I

No luce da luna
Perche luna non c'era
Sez ai en quan di violini
Con ecuando se en son
How can I forget Stromboli?
How can I begin to try?
Tell me I'll regret Stromboli
I'll say what care I
Bali Ha'i may call you any night, any day
In your heart you'll hear it call you, "Come away, come away"
Bali Ha'i will whisper on the wind of the sea
"Here am I, your special island, come to me, come to me"

Your own special hopes
Your own special dreams
Bloom on the hillside
And shine in the streams

If you try, you'll find me
Where the sky meets the sea
Here am I, your special island
Come to me, come to me

Someday you'll see me
Floating in the sunshine
My head sticking out from a low flying cloud
You'll hear me call you
Singing through the sunshine
Sweet and clear as can be
Bali Ha'i will whisper, "Here am I, come to me"
If I ever love again, it will be you
There will be no other one, no one but you
I never want a thing to dim the past
For the love we knew must last

If I ever thrill again, it will be you
And I never will again, to someone new
No one else's charms can fill my empty arms
If I ever love again, it will be you

Cause nobody else's charms can fill my empty arms
If I ever love again, it will be only you
There were tears in the crowded congregation
There were hearts that had loved but all in vain
'Twas goodbye to the sweetheart of the nation
At the wedding of Lili Marlene

Men who'd marched where the desert sands are burning
From Tobruk down the road to Alamein
In their hearts were tender memories were returning
At the wedding of Lili Marlene

As she knelt where the candle lights were gleaming
It seemed the choir sang soft and low
Farewell, my angel of the lamplight
We'll always love you so

Down the aisle came the bride in all her glory
To the strains of her own sweet love refrain
'Twas the end of a very lovely story
At the wedding of Lili Marlene

Farewell, my angel of the lamplight
We'll always love you so
Down the aisle came the bride in all her glory
To the strains of her own sweet love refrain
'Twas the end of a very lovely story
At the wedding of Lili Marlene

[Intro]
Let's tell it to the rooftops that we have got something new
Let's tell it to the rooftops that you have me and I have you
Let's tell it to the rooftops, Lets tell it to the rooftops
Let's tell it to the rooftops

[Verse 1]
Looking at picture frames with thought of dancers and home
Then you looked at me and said I want to be like that
When we're old, when we're old
When we're old
Looking at picture frames with thought of dancers and home
Then you looked at me and said I want to be like that
When we're old, when we're old
When we're old

[Chorus]
Let's tell it to the rooftops that we have got something new
Let's tell it to the rooftops that you have me and I have you
Let's tell it to the rooftops, Lets tell it to the rooftops
Let's tell it to the rooftops

[Verse 2]
We don't have time to do all the things that we need
Then you looked at me and said I'll be gone in a week
In a week, in a week
In a week
We don't have time to do all the things that we need
Then you looked at me and said I'll be gone in a week
In a week, in a week
In a week

[Chorus]
Let's tell it to the rooftops that we have got something new
Let's tell it to the rooftops that you have me and I have you
Let's tell it to the rooftops, Lets tell it to the rooftops
Let's tell it to the rooftops
Let's tell it to the rooftops that we have got something new
Let's tell it to the rooftops that you have me and I have you
Let's tell it to the rooftops, Lets tell it to the rooftops
Let's tell it to the rooftops

[Verse 1]
Alright it's Childish baby, Mr. Talk-About-His-Dick-Again
Nerdy-ass black kid, whatever, man, I'm sick of him
That well-spoken token, who ain't been heard
The only white rapper who's allowed to say the N-word
I buy a bunch of 'em and put it on my black card
Now I got some street cred, use it 'til it's maxed out
I got a girl on my arm, dude, show respect
Something crazy and Asian, Virginia Tech
She too fine, I do dimes
If not that, I'm walking out with two fives
Change my ID for the cops, it's not enough yet
Black male in short shorts, I'm double suspect
Ballin' since '83, half of 'em say he gay
Maybe that's the reason I like Lady What-babies-say
I'm a problem, I'm lame as fuck homie
But I rap like these niggas ain't got shit on me
Fuck the cool kids, not Chuck Inglish
But people who think that hatin on me makes them distinguished
Like, "What is this nigga doin? Rap is for real blacks
I hate that fucking faggot, man, he think that we feel that"
Or "I wrote on rape culture my junior year at Brown
So I'm allowed to say what all his raps are about"
You better shut your mouth before I fuck it
You really hate my lyrics now or Kid Cudi's? Nigga

[Hook]
Runnin this thang, money insane
Busy getting brain like Krang
What, what's my name?
In the woods, got these niggas usin' Mapquest
Man, fuck a backpacker

[Verse 2]
Niggas with OCD, N-W-O
All white like my clothes, CW shows
Nigga got signed, it's an anomaly
No cosign: trigonometry
Man these niggas hate me
"Man, fuck you nigga...fuck you nigga!"
They real black like won't show up on your camera phone
They real black like turn the flash on your camera on
They real black take shit, turn it into gold
I'm real black I survive when the pressure on
Upper echelon, bit my lip when I'm kissin' her
Clash of the Titans, baby your tits is titular
Listenin to some Kiss FM, she wanna hear Nicki Minaj
"Super Bass," super face inside a garage
It's not a massage, spa rap with a happy ending
Old niggas wanna assassinate me
It's a shame, these kids was supposed to save rap
Fuck that, boat shoes and a wave cap
He don't give back, how the fuck a nigga say that?
Summer in November I gave everyone a Maybach
Comin' on that payback, comin' on that mace took
I'm comin' on that real shit, I'm comin' on her Facebook
Fuck a backpacker with a rhino's dick
I do me like a gyno chick, uh

[Hook]
Runnin this thang, money insane
Busy getting brain like Krang
What, what's my name?
In the woods, got these niggas usin' Mapquest
Man, fuck these backpackers
Fuck these backpackers
Fuck these backpackers
Fuck these backpackers

[Intro]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
I got this knot inside my throat, call my vodka up if I come
And I'm not suicidal, I just drink to forget my problems
Seems like the kids these days are all just lookin' to get higher, oh
I'm just the same, anything's I won't tell momma and father

[Pre-Chorus]
Want it all and we want it now
Do anything to not come down
Get my fix someway, somehow, today

[Chorus]
You know, you know just how it goes
We're just stoned, leave us alone
Ain't nothin' wrong, it's cool at home
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned

[Verse 2]
I got my woman, got my high, my guitar, and some money
And I'll be goddamned if these fuckers try to take that from me
But ain't shit wrong with us and don't tell me, "Talk to somebody"
I'm drunk at 2 p.m., treat every day like it's a Friday

[Pre-Chorus]
Want it all and we want it now
Do anything to not come down
Get my fix someway, somehow, today

[Chorus]
You know, you know just how it goes
We're just stoned, leave us alone
Ain't nothing wrong, it's cool at home
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
We're just stoned, leave us alone
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned

[Bridge]
Not much to do these days, we sit and smoke my life away
Just like everyone else I know (Uh)
Not much to do these days, I got too much on the way
Sit back and light up and let go

[Chorus]
You know, you know just how it goes
We're just stoned, leave us alone
Ain't nothing wrong, it's cool at home
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned
Ooh-ooh (Hey-oh-oh-oh), ooh-ooh
We're just stoned, leave us alone (Stoned)
Ooh-ooh (Hey-oh-oh-oh), ooh-ooh
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned (Stoned)

[Verse 1]
People never get it right
Think I'm sweet like a lullaby
But nothing's ever black or white
Yeah, there's more to me than the eye can see
Now, I'm done with being shy
Put my reputation on the line
Slaying like a samurai
I'm like TNT, strike a match on me

[Pre-Chorus]
Uh, uh, uhhh
I be good, I be bad
Be the best that you had
Uh, uh, uhhh
Get you up, lay you down
Yeah, you think you know me now, uhh (hey!)

[Chorus]
I'll show you my darker side (uh-huh!)
Boy, it will blow your mind
Uh, uh, uhhh, baby
I can give you everything if you want it (hey!)
I'll show you my darker side (uh-huh!)
Boy, it will blow your mind
Uh, uh, uhhh, baby
I can give you everything if you want it (hey!)

[Verse 2]
Torture, this came naturally
I got that magical remedy
Knew I'd have you fallin' to your knees
Looked into my eyes, got you mesmerized
Forbidden fruit is drippin' sweet
Poisonin' the heart of me
I can make your dreams reality
I'll get your body high, make you feel alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Uh, uh, uhhh
I be good, I be bad
Be the best that you had
Uh, uh, uhhh
Get you up, lay you down
Yeah, you think you know me now, uhh (hey!)

[Chorus]
I'll show you my darker side (uh-huh!)
Boy, it will blow your mind
Uh, uh, uhhh, baby
I can give you everything if you want it (hey!)
I'll show you my darker side (uh-huh!)
Boy, it will blow your mind
Uh, uh, uhhh, baby
I can give you everything if you want it (hey!)

[Bridge]
Uh, uh, uhhh
Uh, uh, uhhh
Uh, uh, uhhh
Uh, uh, uhhh

[Chorus]
(Hey!) I'll show you my darker side (uh-huh!)
Boy, it will blow your mind
Uh, uh, uhhh, baby
I can give you everything if you want it (hey!)
I'll show you my darker side (uh-huh!)
Boy, it will blow your mind
Uh, uh, uhhh, baby
I can give you everything if you want it (hey!)

[Outro]
(Hey!) I'll show you my darker side (uh-huh!)
Boy, it will blow your mind
Uh, uh, uhhh, baby
I can give you everything if you want it (hey!)
I'll show you my darker side (uh-huh!)

[Spoken Intro]
Yeah, dig brother, um, it's really outta sight here, 

[?] in rain, no buttons to push. But right now I'd like to dedicate this song to everybody here with hearts--- kind of  hearts and ears. Goes something like this here. Yeah! Yeah what I say now! Aye! Yeah so as I said before it's really groovy. I'd like to bore you for about six or seven minutes, do a little thing, you know. Yeah, excuse me for a minute just let me play my guitar right? Right know we're doing a little thing, uh, by Bob Dylan, that's his grandmother over there. This little thing called "Like a Rolling Stone"

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time you were dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say "Beware doll, you're bound to fall", you thought they all
Were a-kiddin' you
You used to(haha)
Laugh about
Every body that was, a-hangin' out
Look at 'cha, now you don't
Talk so loud
Now you don't, baby, seem so proud
'Bout havin' to be scrounging (yeah)
Your next meal

[Chorus 1]
Yeah, how does it feel?
Oh, how does it feel, baby?
To be on your own
No direction at home (look at 'cha)
The complete unknown
(Yeah!) Like a rolling stone

[Verse 2]
Gone to the finest school, alright (hahaha)
Miss Lonely, but, you only used to get
Juiced in it
Nobody here done taught you how to live out in the streets
But now you (haha) just gonna have to get
Used to it
You say you never
You never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you, you've got to realize
He's not sellin'-a, any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And he says, "Hey baby, would you like to, uh, make a deal?"

[Chorus 2]
How does it feel? (baby)
How does it feel?
To be on your  own
No direction home
A complete unknown
(Look at 'cha!) Like a rolling stone

[Verse 3]
Princess on the steeple, and all the pretty people, they are
Laughin', drinkin' thinkin' that they
Got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts and things, but
But you'd better take your diamond ring, I think you'd better
You'd better pawn it, babe
(Yes I know I missed a verse, don't worry)
You used to be, so amused!
At Napoleon in rags and the, sweet talk that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothin'a, nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, you've got no secrets
To conceal

[Chorus 3]
How does it feel? (Yeah, oh!)
How does it feel, baby?
To be on your own
No direction home
A complete unknown
(Look at ya!) Like a rolling stone

[Spoken Outro]
Thank you very much. Yeah, dig this baby, they've got a lil' tune runnin' around called "Rock Me Baby", you know. And all this kinda--- Yeah! Well dig, we got our own little "Rock Me Baby" it'll go something like this here, the words might be wrong but, that's alright. Dig this anyway

(Get out my life)

[Introduction]
Don't let me find out, the bitch in you
Don't let me find out, the snitch in you
Fame and fortune
It's not your forte
Fuck the world now
I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders
Go fuck yourself
Take two a day
Set them on an overdose
And kill yourself
Doctor's orders

[Chorus]
Say, what you living about
Fuck you gon' tell me
Do you remember how you started out though
You looking lost now
(You want a pass, oh damn)
Fake it 'til you make it
Take your little paper book
When you look in the mirror your credibility's gone now
I'd rather be hated on for who I am
Than to be loved for who I'm not
That's word to doc

[Verse 1]
In the few of the people who had a problem
I was this good, scoffed, I just shook off
Probably reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf (golf)
Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant
But based on how I ascended, see how plain it was now, they want me to jet
No one really gave a fuck about my descent, 'till I took off
Mistook me because I look soft
But I stood tall, I just follow the (Doctor's orders)
So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off
Decided opposing you is what I'm 'posed to do alls
I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls
And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all
You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls
And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone
My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
And fucking goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls
Karma's headed for Armageddon, the drama setter
I'm going in, already got an arm and head
And whoever said word are just words
Can't hurt me more than I give a fuck
Even if my image ends up taking a personal hit
Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned
In this bitch and whatever bitches feel like
They didn't deserve what they get
And whatever consequences come with every verse, it's worth it
So Doc turn the beat on, whose turn is it to get murdered on it?
And here's to all the years I spent toeing a line to overtime
As sure as I'm always lying, in my mind
I'm still underground as a groundhog and I'mma go for mine
Like a whole furrow just trying ta dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to mothafuckin' find
I'm starting to slow and these lines are my nines
I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind
All I needed was someone to co-sign, been a (Doctor's)
Assault rifle with the sniper scope for this whole time
Day one, set with the blasters, give me the orders, I spray uh
Pain in the ass and get shot in the ass with a paint gun
Ain't no one safe from, non-believers there ain't none
I even make the bitches I rape cum
I'm waiting on someone to say something
Dre make the bass pump and let the tape run for old time's sake
I spit it straight through, this is take one
The moment you're waiting for has come but

[Chorus]
Fame and fortune
It's not your forte
Fuck the world now
I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders
Go fuck yourself
Take two a day
Set them on an overdose
And kill yourself
Doctor's orders

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse]
The rain can pour, the sun can shine
But I don't mind
The wounds will heal, the scars will fade
But I'm still here to live another day!
You put me down, build me up
But they fail to remember
That I am strong, no I'm not weak, I will not surrender

[Pre-Chorus]
I am a fighter
For freedom is my burning desire
Oh come on baby, let’s start the fire
With just this love to take us higher
I can feel it burning
Your love can keep me going

[Chorus]
Whether I'm down on my knees
Or if the world is on my shoulder
I am alive
I am alive

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse]
The wind will blow, it comes and goes
But I don’t mind
Even if the cross gets hard to bear
I’m still here to live another day!
You put me down, build me up
But they fail to remember
That I am strong, no I am not weak, I will not surrender

[Pre-Chorus]
I am a fighter
For freedom is my burning desire
Oh come on baby, let’s start the fire
With just this love to take us higher
I can feel it burning
Your love can keep me going

[Chorus]
Whether I'm down on my knees
Or if the world is on my shoulder
I am alive
I am alive

[Instrumental Outro]
When we go away, when we go away
Then it will be over, then it will be over
We won't see the day, we won't see the day
Everybody's over, cause everybody's over

(Oh)

[Instrumental break]
Lyrics from Snippet:

[Verse]
I know I'm a stop on the way to your soulmate
I'll fill you up, but only while you wait
You're everything to me, I see my future in your eyes
But I know when you're kissing me that you're just killing time

[Chorus]
It's okay, I know my place
I know I'm a stop on the way
To your soulmate
Ah, ah, ooh, ooh

[Chorus: Gudda Gudda]
Just living life
Blunt smoke in the double cup, got us feeling right
If it ain't about that paper, then I don't wanna talk about it
When a gangsta stand in front your home, you better walk around it
You better walk around it

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy Tell 'Em]
In the maybach
Count a hundred stacks
Take them to the trap
In that black Maybach riding round Miami
Just me and Mack
That swag, I invented that
Turned up till the windows jacked
I'm in the maiblack, 

[?]
Money on my mind, sitting back in that Bentley while my seats recline
Your baby mama got fucked from behind
You thought she was your's, but she mine
Goddamb she fine
I am King Soulja, and that bitch is a dime
All black Cuban link
Stepping out with my Versace mink
I'm so fuckin fly, count that money fast, nigga don't blink
White and red diamonds mixed with pink
I'm pouring Lean all in the sink
I'm so fresh, I'm so clean
I'm the freshest that you ever seen
20 bitches in a limozeen
Uzi with the loaded magazine
I just told you niggas that 

[?]
Walk inside the club, and you know we spending cake
Kept it real, you niggas too fake

[?] all you niggas do is take
A hundred K, yeah I'm counting that
Forgiatos, I'm out in that
Painting my picture up on the wall
Versace Madusa is on my draws
Sippin Lean, going through withdrawls
Versace Madusa is on my draws
Versace Madusa is on my draws
Sippin Lean, going through withdrawls

[Chorus: Gudda Gudda]
Just living life
Blunt smoke in the double cup, got us feeling right
If it ain't about that paper, then I don't wanna talk about it
When a gangsta stand in front your home, you better walk around it
You better walk around it

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
This for my niggas I get high with
This for my niggas that I ride for
Let the tool spark, and light the firecracker like July 4th
Muddy cup got me feeling right
We ain't trippin, we just living life
Don't fuck with niggas, that's the lazy type
If I killed you, your mama ain't raised you right
That's word to Stunna, shout out Cory Gunna, that's my lil brother
Word to my mother, Imma keep this shit Gudda
Everywhere I 

[?]
What's understood should not be explained, I don't fumble my words like I st-st-studder
20 ounce with a 4 in it
It's real sweet and I love it
Soulja rolling that killa
We about to get space high
Getting showfered in the Bentley, we see a smoke cloud when we skate by
We some young niggas getting money
We ain't worried bout that hating shit
We signed up for this lifestyle
We teflon, and we made for this

[Chorus: Gudda Gudda]
Just living life
Blunt smoke in the double cup, got us feeling right
If it ain't about that paper, then I don't wanna talk about it
When a gangsta stand in front your home, you better walk around it
You better walk around it

[Intro - Kanye West]
Somebody said Kanye the best producer out Chicago
Let's go!
(Kanye)
Who am I?
(Kanye)
That's right!
(Kanye)

I went from niggas laughing to going platinum, nigga

[Chorus: Elbee Thrie]
You got a man, but you're fuckin' around
Risking it all, baby, just to get down
You got a man, but you're fuckin' around
Risking it all, baby, just to get down

[Verse 1: Elbee Thrie]
Don't know if you know just what you're starting
But I can see you like to play with fire, darling
Your man just hit the bar to grab a chalice for you two
He turned his back just for a second, look at what you do
Sending me the supersonic signal
You ain't lay a finger, but I feel you
Independent woman, I won't tell you how to act
But you and I both know we could be gone 'fore he gets back

[Chorus: Elbee Thrie & Megan Thee Stallion]
You got a man, but you're fuckin' around
Risking it all, baby, just to get down (Ayy, ah, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2: Megan Thee Stallion]
Don't ask questions if we just sexing (Hey)
I got situations, no conformations (Mwah)
Everybody wanna know who Megan dating (Huh?)
Well that depends on whatever the day is (Hey, hey, woah)
I got me a European papi out in Italy (Okay)
And he like to model, but he always love to picture me
Flying overseas in these Giuseppes (Hey)
Send a pic from the back just to give him a tease (Hey, hey)
I keep a man in Texas, that's where the best is (Best is)
Down south daddy and he cool, never stress me (Yeah)
West coast thang, I'm in love with his slang (Ooh)
Ooh, I love a thug, keep it hood when we bang

[Pre-Chorus: Megan Thee Stallion]
I got a man, but I'm fucking around
'Cause I'm young and I can't be tied down (Ayy, ayy)
He got a girl, she got nothing on me
But we young, so we both do the same thing

[Chorus: Elbee Thrie & Megan Thee Stallion]
You got a man, but you're fuckin' around
I got a man, but I'm fucking around
'Cause I'm young and I can't be tied down
Risking it all, baby, just to get down
He got a girl, she got nothing on me
Because I'm young and we both do the same thing

[Bridge: Elbee Thrie]
You know, I know, you're so wrong for
What we've been doing, this place seems to ruin this love thang
(But I'm only half as wrong as you)
You know what I know, you're so wrong for
What we've been doing, this place seems to ruin this love thang
(But I'm only half as wrong as you)

[Chorus: Elbee Thrie]
You got a man, but you're fuckin' around
You got a man, but you're fuckin' around
Risking it all, baby, just to get down

[Part I]

[Verse 1]
Ever since I was a small boy
No one else compared to you, no way
I always thought heroes stayed close
Whenever troubled times arose
I didn't know
Ain't always how it goes

[Verse 2]
Every single word you told me
I believed without a question, always
To save all of us, you told us both to trust
But now I know you only saved yourself

[Chorus]
Did you think I'd never know?
Never wise up as I grow?

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
And you could store an ocean in the holes
In any of the explanations that you gave
And while you still had time, you had a chance
But you decided to take all your sorrys to the grave

[Chorus]
Did you think I'd never know?
Never wise up as I grow?
Did you hope I'd never doubt?
Never one day work it out?

[Part II]

[Verse 3]
You were runnin' for cover
Doin' like any other
Fallin' out with a lover
You didn't know that I suffered
What a thing to discover
If there was time to recover
One-on-one with each other
Just a boy and a father
What I'd give for another
Everything that I have
Wouldn't need this for long
Never speak of the time
That you left us alone
Me and Steve on our own

[Refrain]
I wanna tell you 'bout the time
Wanna tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play you all my songs
Learn the words, sing along

[Verse 4]
(This time) Wanna tell you 'bout the time
(I know) I was in Abbey Road
Or the time that I had
Mick Jagger on the phone
I thought of you when we spoke

[Refrain]
Wanna tell you 'bout the time
Wanna tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play you all my songs
Hear your voice sing along

[Verse 5]
(This time) I wanna say, "It's all right"
(I know) You're just a man after all
And I know you had demons
I got some of my own
I think you passed them along

[Refrain]
Wanna tell you 'bout the time
Wanna tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play you all my songs
And hear your voice sing along
There's thrill in the danger
Of having it all
It's not like it made ya
But it's not your call
Have you ever felt it
It lives without a name
It's more like a feeling
If feeling felt the same

Now you'll start to worry
And worry's no good
For it shows no mercy
If misunderstood

A detrimental concept to inflict upon oneself
I'd offer my condolences if you'd put the words to rest

Now that's it's made you
Are you really whole?
Now that you've got something
Is thrill just fear disguised?
Although you deserve it
You'll try to no avail
To find out its purpose
Is forever veiled
An interesting concept to attribute reason for
Impenetrable fortresses always have hidden doors
A detrimental concept to inflict upon oneself
I'd offer words of wisdom if I had the words to tell

We are stuck inside a home unsettled
What good is it if you can't give it back?
I like, you like, we like nothing
But we pretend that we're happy
There is nothing left to give

[Verse 1]
Waking up, different from getting up
A plane to Chicago was proof enough
That I should just finally trust within the universe
You showed me, it is real
You made a change I will never forget
Now I wish I could show you everything it meant
Even if I would try
Don't know where I'd begin
Whatever it is I don't understand

[Chorus]
I'll never know what you go through
But I'd do it all again with you
With the light that fills, it's always on the go
I just wanted you to know

[Verse 2]
That's okay
Now it's harder to enjoy the view
Feels like I stole it all the way from you
It makes me hate myself and what I do
But deep inside I know that's not quite true
Now I'm back all alone in the van
I'm crying 'cause I know I'm doing all I can
Maybe it's something else, something out of my hands
However it is, I don't understand

[Chorus]
I'll never know what you go through
But I'd do it all again with you
With the light that's always on the go
I just wanted you to know

[Bridge]
Baby, if you need me, I can fit you in my schedule
Baby, when I need you, can you fit me in your schedule?
Baby, if you need, me I can fit you in my schedule
Baby, when I need you, can you fit me in your schedule?
Oh-ohh

[Outro]
It gets cold at night, cold at night, cold as snow
It gets cold at night, cold at night, cold as snow
It gets cold at night, cold at night, cold as snow
It gets cold at night, cold at night, cold as snow
It gets cold⁠—

[Verse]
We shall get down to kneel
Gathering for the big reveal
We shall be prepped to pay
Practicing to look the other way
Progress is killing our home
We're pretending to the throne
If something's out there, know it's rare
That I would ask and you'd reply
Offer what you can this time

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Overtime
I got a lot of friends, it keeps growing
Keeping me company when my hand's glowing
Setting it down is worse than not knowing

[Refrain]
Don't give your whole life away
That is all you have to do

[Verse 2]
I don't mind, really
I just don't like talking about that anymore
Life's been a lot of "tell your story"
"When did you meet and where's it all going?"

[Chorus]
Take your love away
Would it ever be enough?
Take your love away
Would it ever be enough?

[Verse 3]
Hold on tight
There are a lot of things arriving at your door
Try to engage and stick to the story
You haven't changed but now you're less boring

[Refrain]
Don't live your whole life away
That is all I ask of you

[Verse 4]
Life's a lot of sleeping though
I'll get some problems resolved in my dreams
Holding a gaze is hard while floating
Where have you been and where are you going?

[Chorus]
Take your love away
Would it ever be enough?
Take your love away
Would it ever be enough?
Take your love away
Would it ever be enough?
Take your love away
Would it ever be enough?

[Verse 1]
Can't you see through this man?
He is not good for them

[Chorus]
Are you? Are you? Are you animal?
Are you? Are you? Are you honest?

[Verse 2]
Right back to where we're from
Animal toting gun

[Chorus]
Are you? Are you? Are you animal?
Are you? Are you? Are you honest?

[Bridge]
What we see, not a test
Nothing to ignore
Waiting with bated breath
One foot out the door

[Verse 3]
Now it's time, lead the way
Give them shelter from the reign

[Chorus]
Are you? Are you? Are you animal?
Are you? Are you? Are you honest?

[Bridge]
What we see, not a test
Nothing to ignore
Waiting with bated breath
One foot out the door
Choose not to, say and do
Nothing in return
Lead them all, train them all
So that we endure

[Verse 4]
All that we can do
See right through it all

[Intro]
Run with me, fitness is all I know
Run with me, fitness is all I know
Run with me, fitness is all I know

[Verse1]
Train my mind to hunger for playback and talk
Follow closely these voices, it's better than thoughts
Forward Motion God is the words of this song
Don't complete these words, just cut them
Run with me, fitness is all I know

Run with me (run with me, run with me, run with me)

[Verse2]
I've done a lot of mixing with my numbers
You've made a lot of mistakes with my pride
But if life is change and change is hard
Will patience be what's living?
How much farther to go
I'm outpacing a feeling that someone can serve as a home
Just focus on reaching the things that are under control
And do it alone
Look down at the road
Lift up your feet
And convince them to never be slowed

[Bridge]
And we used to blame distance when something was wrong
And it used to mean something when someone was gone
And it used to be silence and now it's a hum
And it used to mean something when someone was gone

[Outro]
Run with me, fitness is all I know
Run with me, fitness is all I know
Run with me, fitness is all I know

[Verse 1]
Give me something to help me pass the time
A shallow effort to wade through what seems eternity
I don't mind

Giving up if it means I can unwind
To find out I am trapped inside
Who I shouldn't be, ah-ah-ah

I'll give you something if you return in kind
A subtle dose of nothing more than
Complacency, you may find

[Chorus]
I see an eagle in a tailored suit
There's nothing quite like its point of view
It's like a mirror looking through my eyes
A life, unlived, shadowed by disguise

[Verse 2]
We are all just waiting in a line
Forming thoughts we think would never occur to them, ah-ah-ah
But we could never fully satisfy
Our endless need to know it doesn't occur to us
Ah-ah-ah

[Chorus]
I see an eagle in a tailored suit
There's nothing quite like its point of view
It's like a mirror looking through my eyes
A life, unlived, shadowed by dis-

[Outro]
Eagle in a paradise
It comes, it goes, it already knows
Your life, has it passed you by?
It came, it went, now you're in a hole

[Verse 1]
When you look with your eyes widened
And your mouth open
And you breathe
So deeply
You've been acting shy lately
Can't say what's on your mind lately
And you breathe
So deeply

[Chorus]
How do you feel?
How do you feel?

[Verse 2]
Up until the sun rises
Just to use our time wisely
And to breathe
So deeply
You said you've seen signs happening
But you can't even look at me
And you breathe
So deeply

[Chorus]
How do you feel?
How do you feel?
How do you feel?
How do you feel?

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Like an echo from the past
Here for long, but not quite here to last
Do some wrong and log the feedback
And gather dust along the way
Did I do
Always think of you
Don't regret what I did
Just finish what you chew
It's so hard, this I know
In the end it's space to grow
Not just distance

[Chorus/Outro]
How do you feel?
How do you feel?
Are you safe or not?
Just sayin' somethin' new
Are you in a lie?
Doin' what you do

We can get it right
Believin' in the light
Are you safe or not?
Happens all the time
Happens all the time

How did I know that
You wouldn't notice
Everything in focus
Everything in focus

We can get it right
Believin' in the light
Are you safe or not?
Happens all the time
Happens all the time
Are you safe or not?
Stopped you but you just knew
Are you in a lie?
The action was overdue

We can get it right
Believin' in the light
Are you safe or not?
Happens all the time
Happens all the time

Tell me what to do
Always seem to lose
Tell me what to say
Always in the way
Tell me what to do
Always seem to lose
Tell me what to say
I'm always in the way
Me and my private shield
You can't see a single thing
But we can; you—
Fear my private shield
You haven't any idea
What we can do

Just like a vine
You shall crawl, you shall snap
You shall seek mindlessly
Just like a vine stuck in dirt
What you dig, whats your deed
Ordinary, so naive
Shall remain, secret screen
Secret world inside, just for me

Me and my private shield
You can't see a single thing
But we can; you—
Fear my private shield
You haven't any idea
What we can do
Just like a dog
Heed and beg, tempered dog
Time to move along, get along
Chase and sniff your way on
Oh, simple mind
Sob and moan if you like
Don't bark at what you couldn't climb, couldn't find
Tug your leash, to pretend you would bite

At me and my private shield
You can't see a single thing
But we can; you—
Fear my private shield
You haven't any idea
What we can do

Private shield
Private shield

I'm stepping in between two
Worlds, shifting, like a ghost
Time is a play, a good game
I can relate to that
Left behind, you didn't know
You couldn't think, had to take a score so low
High enough to line it up, and sigh
And size it up and blow some smoke
For me and my private shield
You can't see a single thing
But we can; you—
Fear my private shield
You haven't any idea
What we can do

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like a guilty pleasure
Sometimes it don't feel like pleasure at all
Face in the air like I'm trying to fool ya
What a surprise, I'm just fooling myself
Glued to my phone, I'm just trying to hear ya
Sweat on the glass burning holes in my hand
I don't wanna believe in a new communion
Pour out the wine, taste the blood in my breath

[Chorus]
'Til I go and find out it's so easy
Turn and walk away from all the sadness
Even if it feels too hard to handle
I know it's just a reason to let it fly

[Verse 2]
Bending my will, but the effort is wasted
Hung up and dry, just a tool in the shed
Springing the trap 'cause it's testing my patience
What a surprise, it was all in my head
Going to Hell, guess they killed me with kindness
Drank all my time, now I'm eating the chance
Is a moment of truth such an inconvenience?
Peel off the rind, bite the fruit in my hands

[Chorus]
'Til I go and find out it's so easy
Turn and walk away from all the sadness
Even if it feels too hard to handle
I know it's just a reason to let it fly

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Show me love
Treat it like we freakin' on the weekend, show me love
I heat up the seconds, times and reasons for your love
This is not the season for nobody else, but us
I always get wrapped up in you, baby, I'm in love
We gon' get this love, yeah, like we never done it

Show me love like you see red lights
And you crashed in it like a deer inside of headlights
Yeah, I showed you love like it was passionate
I just wanna bask in it, winnin' it like a championship
You gon' show me love like, like you tried it and denied it (Yeah)
But you still let me apply it like I made you put your ties in
Show me lo-o-ove, even when you don't got time to
I'll be there to find ya, I'll remind ya

[Chorus: Alicia Keys, Miguel, Alicia Keys & Miguel]
Show me love
Treat it like we freakin' on the weekend, show me love
I heat up the seconds, times and reasons for your love

I always get wrapped up in you, baby, I'm in love

[Bridge: Miguel with Alicia Keys]
Baby, you know what it is
You know what it is
Baby, you know what it is
Yeah, you know what it is
You gon' show what it means to love
You gon' show what it means to love
Ahh

[Chorus: Alicia Keys, Miguel, Both]
Go ahead, show me love
Treat it like we freakin' on the weekend, show me love
I heat up the seconds, times and minutes for your love
This is not the season for nobody else but us
I always get wrapped up in you, baby
I'm in love
We gon' get this love in like we never done it
Baby, I'm in love
Go 'head, show me love, like we never done it
Yeah, I got you runnin'

(Like we never did)
(Baby, like we never did)
(Like we never did)
(Like we never did, babe)

[Verse 1]
I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 2]
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with the time
Left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Outro]
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind

[Intro: Timbaland]
Yeah
Yeah, uh-huh

[Verse 1: Madonna & Justin Timberlake]
C'mon boy
I've been waiting for somebody to pick up my stroll
Well, don't waste time
Give me a sign, tell me how you wanna roll
I want somebody to speed it up for me
Then take it down slow
There's enough room for both
Well, I can handle that
You just gotta show me where this at
Are you ready to go?
Are you ready to go?

[Pre-Intro]
In all, enthrilling new, living sound

[Intro: Timbaland]
Kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo
She kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo

Kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, every day in training to get the gold
That’s why your body's crazy
But you can’t run from yourself, that’s where it’s difficult
Girl I can see in your eyes that there’s something inside that made you evil
Where did you go, cause it just ain't fair
Over here thinking bout the shh you say
Don't know why it gets to me

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
It cuts right on my eye, yeah it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out
What am I supposed to do?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I don't understand it
Tell me how could you be so low?
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe
This ain't the girl I used to know
No, not anymore, TKO

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
I’m out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
It's just a TKO
I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
T-TKO
Out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
Now, I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, now I really know what we're fighting for
This rematch sex is amazing
But nobody wins when if somebody’s heart is swole
Cause when I see you move like you got something inside that made you lethal
Where did you go, it just ain't fair
Over here thinking bout the shh you do
Don't know what I got to lose

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
It cuts right on my eye, yeah it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out
What am I supposed to do?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I don't understand it
Tell me how could you be so low?
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe
This ain't the girl I used to know
No, not anymore, TKO

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
I’m out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
It's just a TKO
I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out

[Intro: Earl Sweatshirt & Mac Miller]
Uh, look at you (Woo), look at you
Look at you, look at you (

[?])

[Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt & Mac Miller]
I don't want this to come between us (Yeah)
But right now I look the worst that you probably seen me (Yeah)
The come down worse than the high, Momma, believe me
(Look at you)
And that's true
You got some problems to deal with and that's you
(Look at you)
I can't even talk, I ain't meanin' to act rude
It's just I'm just kinda hot and it's easy to catch (Yeah)
I'ma leave it at that (Yeah)
(Yeah) And that's—

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Me's tryna tell you somethin' (Woo)
But a feelin' like this has no words, so
I keep on wastin' time and ever since my angel died
The halo shine is rusted (Whoa)
I say I'm fine, I'm frontin'
Every day I just been blunted
Mind is cloudy as my judgement, shit
You know I'm cut from the same cloth that they use for Kevlar
(Kevlar)
Ain't sober much, I've been faded off and I don't remember (Nah)
I'm goin' up like my name was God
Who the fuck are you sayin' I'm not?
My thoughts are heavy, weighin' down my brain with pressure
(I can't take it)
I'm pickin' up the roaches out the ashtray (That's true)
Yeah, ain't fuckin' with no hoes that's in the rap game (That's true)
There's somethin' different 'bout me
Ever since I whipped the Audi
Smell it like it's the shit around me
Feelin' like the Big Lebowski (I'm that dude)
Sick of showin' sad faces
I was hidden in the bat cave where the bitches came in nightly
Keepin' it as spicy as my last name (Mr. McCormick)
I bet a million dollars, show you who your friends are (Friends are)
I don't need respect, just show me where the checks are (Checks are)
The game is full of clones, you stick out like a red Ferrari
Go fix your problems, swipin' my American Express card (Ching!)
You tell me I'm arrogant, I say that I'm certain (Certain)
I talk to my therapist, it ain't really workin' (Workin')
I can't tell if I'm just crazy or a genius (Genius)
You my weakness, it's becomin' inconvenient (Broken pieces)

[Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt & Mac Miller]
I don't want this to come between us (No)
But right now I look the worst that you probably seen me (Yeah)
The come down worse than the high, Momma, believe me
(Look at you)
And that's true
(Look at you)
You got some problems to deal with and that's you
(Look at you)
I can't even talk, I ain't meanin' to act rude
It's just I'm just kinda hot and it's easy to catch (Look)
I'ma leave it at that

[Verse 2: Mac Miller & Delusional Thomas]
All of your screamin' got me smokin' weed to relax (Weed)
Yeah, some sativa to pass to feed the demons I have (Woo)
I never gave a fuck, why should I start now? (Start now)
Big dreams, small town
Get you while your guard down
The realest — speakin' in facts
This shit is — deeper than rap
I put my city — on the map
I'm rockin' a — P on my cap (Pittsburgh)
Tell him that Jesus is back
And all he after (After)
Is for a bottle of whiskey and some freaks he can smash
(Life's so expensive, hah)
But to me it's as cheap as the fees in the cab
To go down the street and then back (Sir, thank you)
All this fever I have, heatin' the people to ash
I'ma start beatin' your ass for no reason (Hah)
Colder than the snow season (Oh)
Elevation, no ceilin' (Woo)
We all goin' home eatin'
And we done with dope dealin' (Yep)
Everything legitimate, limitless
We all got businesses
I made my way
The eight sideways, we infinite
Yeah, I bet a million dollars, show you who your friends are (Friends are)
I don't need respect, just show me where the checks are (Checks are)
I'm down to bang 'til I'm out the game like a red card
Chill in outer space in a Death Star
Hollerin' at bitches still (Bitches still)
Hope they down to chill at the crib and they freakish (I need it)

[Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt]
I don't want this to come between us
But right now I look the worst that you probably seen me
The come down worse than the high, Momma, believe me
And that's true
You got some problems to deal with and that's you
I can't even talk, I ain't meanin' to act rude
It's just I'm just kinda hot and it's easy to catch
I'ma leave it at that

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
Upon first glance, I look through the soul, no words spoken
Heart frozen, tear drops stained pillow cases roll over (Shit)
Got over that, built to last
I'ma pro from that to be honest
No goin' back, life's journey
No chosen path settin' sails around countless convicted felons
Maximum security
Only presence felt with is tested
No tellin', send us to death or to the chair (Yee)
In my ghetto, the children probably consider me the mayor (Whoa)
Full-fledged, bein' gangster don't mean shit without the bread
Bread winners association, you not  wit' that, you dead (Dead)
Or deadbeat, fresh sneaks surroundin' my feet (Check on my walk)
But walk like there no jury, get off right
Now let's shake it back from my loss
From the ones I thought thought like me
I'm greetin' they talk like me, well, until my back was turned
Old-fashioned clutch rest and can't handle it, back then turned
All black affair, I learned to order manslaughter
Peep out they flaws, attack 'em
Action brought them bands off 'em
Makin' statements places where I'm hated, flossin' jags on 'em
Out shoppin' out in Calabasas, mind still entrapped
Traps up in every cabinet
Fake bricks and counterfeit money in every closet
Just in case I'm caught slippin', you get me
You tried to rob your mind, plottin' where I'm thinkin'
Somewhat'll be mind bogglin', ten toes deep in the game
Step ahead of the corner, on my head or around it
My aggression rerouted, he had to die
The bitch violated, question me 'bout it
Go to war with whoever love who upset with about it
Flee the scene, jumpin' bonds
Detectives guessin' about me
Where the money come from? (Get on the ground)
Cold cash makin' deposits
Arrest record's shot, I ain't never sentenced for bodies
Motorcycle was 

[?]
This a rented Ducati
Wide body, sippin' lean when I ride it
Feel like I'm flyin', nigga, watch how I glide it
Got it?

[Verse 1]
You've been gone for way too long
Mama said gone for way too long
It’s about time to come back home
Papa said time to come back home
Come back home, come back home, come back home

[Chorus]
I think I'll stay for a while
Just a while
Too much fun
Yeah, I think I'll stay for a while
I got time
Said and done

[Chorus]
I think I’ll stay for a while
Just a while
Too much fun
Yeah, I think I'll stay for a while
I got time
Said and done

[Verse 2]
You've been gone for way too long
Mama said gone for way too long
It's about time to come back home
Papa said time to come back home
Come back home, come back home, come back home

[Chorus]
I think I'll stay for a while
Just a while
Too much fun
Yeah, I think I'll stay for a while
I got time
Said and done

Too much fun
Yeah, I think I'll stay for a while

Too much fun, too much fun

[Verse 1]
All my life I've been learning
I've always lived for today
And I don't know about tomorrow
But I can choose to make it great

[Bridge]
Get used to me
Not being what you want
I guarantee
There's more than what you thought
There's one of me
Get used to me
I can't waste all my many days, no

[Chorus]
Cause we, we burn faster than light
Shine across in the night sky
We burn faster than light
We burn faster than light, light light

[Post-Chorus]
Light, Light, Light
Light, Light, Light
Light, Light, Light
Light, Light, Light
Light, Light, Light
We, we burn faster than light

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
'Bout me now, 'bout me

If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

You're tryin' my patience, try pink carnations, red roses and yellow daffodils
Don't forget the flowers Sunday, I know you will
Displayers of affection and all good intentions, why don't you just send me the bill
Don't forget the flowers someday, I know you will

Whether you've been takin' me way too seriously, ewwwewwhoo
I can't ever explain why I don't feel the pain, ewwewwhoo
I left you behind I know its been along time, but I'm not over you
Don't forget the flowers someday, I hope I do

You're tryin' my patience, try pink carnations, red roses and yellow daffodils
Don't forget the flowers someday, I know I will
Don't forget the flowers someday, I know I will

[Intro]
My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic

[Verse 1]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

[Verse 2]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby, yeah

[Bridge]
And when I'm feelin' alone
You remind me of home
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I pretend that we're there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas (To you)

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"

[Outro]
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (Darling)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (I just want you to know)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Where every wish comes true
I love you

[Verse 1]
All of the troubled times that we have overcome
All of the trials to find somewhere that we belong
All I know is that, with you, I'm holding on
'Cause all of the days out, all of the days out on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you love it? How it all just fades away
When your clothes don't feel the songs of yesterday
And I can't go back, and I can't go back
Don't you love it? How it all, it all just fades away

[Chorus]
It all just fades away

[Verse 2]
All of the tracks we traced, we raced to reach the sun
All of the lights to find a place where we belong
All I know is that, with you, I'm moving on
'Cause all of the days out, all of the days out on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't go back, and I can't go back
Don't you love it? How it all, it all just fades away

[Chorus]
It all just fades away
It all just fades away
It all just fades away
It all just fades away

[Outro]
And I can't go back and I can't go back
Don't you love it? How it all, it all just fades away

[Verse]
I've been a sinner more than I've been a saint
Spend too much time being something that I ain't
I'm sick and tired of being half right
Chasing after a past lie
Just another face in the crowd
It's time to start living out loud

[Chorus]
I wanna be free, yeah
I wanna be free, yeah

[Verse]
I've been a sinner more than I've been a saint

[Verse 1]
Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody (Somebody)
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me (Stop me)

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Outro]
(Hey)

[Verse 1]
Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world filled with magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The division bell's ringing had begun
Down the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

[Verse 3]
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes will stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been a hundred times

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder
The light was brighter
The grass was greener
For ever and ever

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
When I think of Home
I think of place
Where there's love overflowing
I wish I was home
I wish I was back there
With the thing i've been knowing
Wind that makes the tall glass
Bend into leaning
Suddenly, the raindrops that fall
Have a meaning
Sprinklin the scene
Makes it all clean

[Verse 2]
Maybe there's a chance
For me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It sure would be nice
To be back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I
Can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time
In my life to grow up
Time, be my friend, let me start again

[Verse 3]
Suddenly, my world's gone
And changed It's face
But I still know where I'm going
I have had my mind spun around in space And yet, I've watched it growing
And if you're listening god, please, Don't make it hard
To know if we should believe the things That we see
Tell us, should we try to stay
Should we run away, or would it be Better just to let things be?

[Verse 4]
Living here in this brand new world
Might be a fantasy
But its taught me to love
So it real, real, real to me
And I've learned
That we must look inside our hearts
To find
A world full of love
Like yours, Like mine
Like Home
I know we don't talk much but you're but you're such a good talker, oh-whoa
Well I know we should take a walk but y'er such a fast walker, oh-whoa, well alright

Pour me water I reconstitute constant movement
Proven grounds, I fell down, I was Harry's student
Tase your leash, stripes on me like I'm Freddie Kruger, shaded the elm tree
You know I blew up before I grew up, you're smart
I guess you know what pressure do, huh?
Serengeti pulchritude on a petty new one
Keep the Betty Boops just
Tell em send the fetti through us
Stupid
Which race is you willing to run?
Strong filaments, I'm finna print me a gun
We all militant
Omnipotence, we dealing with swords, you all filler
Con-killer consortium
Mob business
Mav getting the torch, Mach lit it
Five nine, nine point five size foot on the door
Kicking it
We all in live, nigga galore
Know I've been here before
Cry rivers, swim to the shore, and chop timber
I'm building a fort, war time
It's final resort, but it's not a resort, I'm
Disciplining the thoughts
Ain't no way we gon be
Winning them all but we embark
Eat a loss by the seas like mally Mall
Keep your albatross, and your magic beans
I got a heart pulling strings and I'm
Climbing stalks, harking back to the days of yore
Giant swords on my lion heart
Time to spark

[Verse 1]
I've been diggin’ you for such a long time
You don't even know that I'm alive
Something about the way you walk just really blows my mind
Sorry but I’m sick of all this jive

[Intro: Kevin Abstract and JOBA]
I know I always do it better when I see ya
I know I always gotta leave in such a hurry
Left me in the sink with my face all dirty
Parked outside of Sonic and my niggas got
Got too much shit to think about (I know I'm broken)
Got too much shit to think about (Yeah nigga, I know)

[Chorus: JOBA]
Nothing in my head ever makes sense
Nothing in my head ever makes sense
Tell me who I am, I don't know if (Nothing in my head)
I'm doing dumb shit I did before (Ever makes sense)
Running from all I know (Nothing in my head)
Hate it when my mama calls (Ever makes sense)

[Post-Chorus: JOBA]
Her baby boy has lost his soul
The life he lives sure takes a toll
It's all in my head
It's all in my head

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
They tryna publicate these watered down soliloquies
And wonder why I don't reciprocate the energy
I'm movin' vividly, I ain't for the civility
They check my brilliancy, uh
What's next when you shake up the world within a trilogy?
Become a better human? Check your masculinity?
The Brutuses around you start to move suspiciously
Too many voices around me, I don't need a polyphony
This ain't for dignity
This ain't for principle
It's just the truth that there's nobody that's invincible

[Chorus: JOBA]
Nothing in my head ever makes sense
Nothing in my head ever makes sense
Tell me who I am, I don't know
I'm doing dumb shit I did before (Nothing in my head ever makes sense)
Running from all I know (Nothing in my head ever makes sense)
Hate it when my mama call

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
What's heaven look like?
What our brothers look like?
What he look like when he realize that we not alike?
I was younger, I would pretend my toothbrush was a mic
Late to school 'cause I was singing in the mirror like I just got signed
(Your truth gon' set me free)
(Your truth gon' set me free)
I'm hangin' on by a rope, come on Angelo
Come on, let me grow, let me love, let me glow
Had the TV show, shit let me know
Can't trust people
Cried thinkin' about how I can't help people that put me first
Man, the pride shit hurt 'cause I know ma hurt
Do I help her or watch her hurt?
Bein' petty by the time she ain't put me first
It could be made up (Ah, ah)
It's probably made up (Ah)

[Harmonizing]

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh. ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & bearface, Both]
Gave, gave, gave, gave it to you (Yeah, yeah)
You're the type of dog that'll bark
That'll steal, that'll fuckin' chew (No)
If I gave, gave, gave, gave it to you (Yeah, yeah)
You're the type of dog that'll bark
That'll steal, that'll fuckin' chew (No)

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
There's something I'm missin'
Surely not worth the trippin'
But it's not worth dismissin'
I gotta say what I feel
Niggas know that it's real
This that G-Unit feel
When them lame niggas trippin'
It's just my dogs in the field
And we shine over here
They lookin' blind over there
Our community's stuck
To show that they do not care
To show that these songs just moments you can move to
But truthfully I be having attacks
Tryin' to figure out how I'mma eat next

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & bearface, Both]
Gave, gave, gave, gave it to you (Yeah, yeah)
You're the type of dog that'll bark
That'll steal, that'll fuckin' chew (No)

[Verse 2: Joba]
Showed up late without a cake to your birthday
You were quick to forgive me, uh
Your daddy says I'm nothin' but a bad boy
And off limits but he don't get it
Little does he know we take his Audi out, uh
Little does he know that I am well endowed, uh
Never been in love with anyone 'till now so fuck it
You and me, that's going down
It's itchy, I'm itching
There's blades of grass imprinted on your back side
As well as mine
We're so impure, but yet so pure
I feel God's presence when we run and hide

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I don't know if I've been trippin', I can't make a decision
Feel like I'm stuck in a mission that brings me back to the stop
So is it even a finish when I work like a menace
To fill a void that I'm missin', I couldn't tell it apart
I hate when people don't listen and they just wait to reply
I see no heart in your eyes, you players real in disguise
I wash my feelings with time, treat my feelings like tides
Even when I'm feeling shallow, it's still a lake in my mind
I think I'm drowning, I've been surrounded with false intentions
And now I'm clouded, I never doubted, and didn't give in
Have a garden, was filled with snakes and I started kicking
In slow-mo and into motion to rebuild what's gotten broken, yeah

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & bearface, Both]
Gave, gave, gave, gave it to you (Yeah, yeah)
You're the type of dog that'll bark
That'll steal, that'll fuckin' chew (No)
If I gave, gave, gave, gave it to you (Yeah, yeah)
You're the type of dog that'll bark
That'll steal, that'll fuckin' chew (Yeah)

[Verse 5: Merlyn Wood]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm the fucker with the tiger style
Big ballin' won't see me at the 

[?]
Where my croissants? Where my diamond dial?
I saw a poster said "I need my money tall as Yao"
Money like girls, it came around
Girls like money, y'all can bounce
Four seasons brunchin', stop face scrunchin'
Divin' in these dimes, Scrooge McDuckin'
Fine dime pumpin'
She grabbin' at my stomach, fuck it
I got a big tab but I run it
I see the atlas and I run it
I see a big tab and I run it
I learn the atlas and I run it
Mm, boom
What the point of being famous?
Gettin' sweat and spit on me
What the point of being famous?
Gettin' sweat and spit on me
Last time
I fucked on my past life
I turned left and not right
And you just blame it on my star sign

How come
You're crooked when you smile like
Everything's just aligned right?
But you can't be lyin', if it feels right, feels right

Don't play the card
C'mon baby
You can play me in the mean time
It's not that hard
Just want you into my life, my life
It's not always about the right time, right time
Might never be the right time

What's wrong?
Am I not the right month?
Why does somebody gotta tell you who to love?
You can't remember what you're made of
Last night
I lost my mind on the turnpike
Tell me how am I supposed to live right
When you unloop another belt at night

You're like my god
You might be maybe
I want you into my life
It's not that hard
Won't you blame me on the wrong sign, wrong time

Second time's a charm
Can you feel it baby?
10 to 2, drive me how you like
I know it's hard, but don't believe that we're just not right

[Intro]
5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

[Verse 1]
Taking off this evening to fight this winter day
Brokenhearted I've been, I'll leave it on the land to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got an island in my back-pocket, lookin' for a way to find love anyday
I'll spend the holiday inside these sapphire waves as the sunset's sinkin' away

[Chorus]
Light the night
Starry-eyed
Waved goodbye
So long, this might be the year
I will fall in love with the one my heart's dreaming of

[Verse 2]
Shallow glasses breaking, the longing never ends
Letting go of ways that we changed, still I pretend

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got an island in my back-pocket, lookin' for a way to find love anyday
I'll spend the holiday inside these sapphire waves as the sunset's surfin' away

Ba--ba-ya-ohh
Ba--ba-ya-ohh
Ba--ba-ya-ohh

[Chorus]
Light the night
Starry-eyed
Waved goodbye
So long, this might be the year
I will fall in love with the one my heart's dreaming of
Turn to dark
Fire flower
Don't pass me by
I've waited on through years to find the tears falling from everything my heart could dream of

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Do, do, do...

[Intro: Ninja]
Yo
This zef
We 'bout to take it to the next fuckin' level
Die Antwoord vs. Enya
Orinoco Ninja Flow
Sail away motherfucker remix
Are you ready for this
Are you ready for this, girl
Check it

[Verse 1: Ninja/*Yo-Landi Visser*]
I think about you when I masturbate
You can't even believe it but that's OK
On the microphone I fascinate
When I let my 3rd eye exaggerate
Freaky visions, I tell you what I see
Cold concrete scattered with dry leaves
You naked lying on the pavement
People are standing round with laanie shoes
You can hardly move, you look sexy
All of a sudden, the streets are empty
You stand up, open your eyelids
You in a trench coat, it's French, you look stylish
You walk in the silence, not sure what the time is
It's totally twilight, the sky is violet
An abandoned house, look ahead to see
Someone open the door, yes it's me
With the meanest penis you ever seen
You're on your period, with no tampon
You kneel down and get with the vibe *(Sail away, motherfuckers)*
Your period blood has crystallised *(Sail away, motherfuckers)*
You offer me the red crystal, it's ill *(Sail away, motherfuckers)*
Grab hold of the mic tight, tonight's the night *(Sail away, motherfuckers)*

[Verse 2: Ninja]
Lift up your dress, open up your legs
Your vagina's sewn up, untie the thread
My sublime rhyme inside your head
Your mind is rushing, vagina gushing
Another chick in the corner taking a piss
(It looks nice) The whole vibe's totally kinky
Look around, the new room is fancy
Remove your fur coat, remove your panties
I'm rocking a suit and a blackface mask
I ejaculate into a champagne glass
Your precious flesh is so mysterious
Pierce your nipples with two long needles
Like a crucifix, take you to another level
While I get my freak on, the vibe is mental
Transcendental, we somewhere else now
Still rocking a mask, but I've taken off my suit
You rocking a mask too, shaking your nice boobs
I tell you I like you, you feel my piel

[Chorus: Yo-Landi Visser]
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, fucked up love
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, fucked up love
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, fucked up love

Sail away motherfuckers
Sail away motherfuckers
Sail away motherfuckers
Sail away motherfuckers

[Verse 3: Ninja/*Yo-Landi Visser*]
You arrive at the cemetery in time for the ceremony
I give you a hot kiss, grab hold of your ass cheeks
How'd you like to get laid on this
Tombstone in the middle of the rain forest
My gaze puts you in a daze, I'm loving your long tongue
Look at your beautiful face, covered in hot come
Spread my wings block out the sun
Lie on my back, scope out your bum
My penis stays hard, you breathing heavily
I penetrate you, the feeling's heavenly
Now bounce girl, you know it's hot *(Sail away, motherfuckers)*
Bounce, bounce girl, like oh my god! *(Sail away, motherfuckers)*
Totally freaky deaky funky *(Sail away, motherfuckers)*
Ninja make you leave your body *(Sail away, motherfuckers)*

[Intro]
When will we die? This life isn't fair
I miss the high, I live a lie
And one day we'll die, no one will care
Take me inside, I'll meet you there

[Chorus]
Am I alive? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Am I aware? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Do you get high? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Are we prepared? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Then one day we'll die (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
No one will care (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Do you get high? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We will survive (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
Yeah
Who do you think you are?
Young man? Young man?
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Man, I think you went too far
You can't stop the dance
Don't ever let 'em stop the dance, yeah
Are we all numb? Where are we goin'?
What have we become? It all keeps on rollin'
A little bit of light lets the hope grow
A lot goes on that they don't know
Just give me a sign, to show me somethin'
Is it my time? Can I stop runnin'?
Lost in the night and it's so cold
Forget the things that we don't know
I made my peace, can I go home?

[Chorus]
Am I alive? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Am I aware? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Do you get high? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Are we prepared? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Then one day we'll die (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
No one will care (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Do you get high? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We will survive (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
To the girl named Danger, so good to see you
Don't be a stranger, it's clear I need you
The angels will fall, not a saint after all
Back to the wall, let me free you
Protect me from evil, give me a reason
Where are the good people? Give us our freedom
Where are the dreamers?
Can you show me the dreamers?
And we are the creatures, prophets and teachers
We are believers, lost in amnesia
Will you let me fade away? I wanna fade away

[Chorus]
Am I alive? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Am I aware? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Do you get high? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Are we prepared? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Then one day we'll die (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
No one will care (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Do you get high? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We will survive (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Intro]
Uh
Uh (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Oh shit, here come the best part
Weapons from the Death Star
Puttin' metals through your Kevlar
Methods unorthodox
Due to the endorphins lost
I'm morphin' to some sort of corpse
Don't snort the devil's nectar
It's hard drugs and memoirs
Don't fuck with shit except ours
The rest is lightweight
For Christ's sake, I'm knockin' heads off
Depressed off the meds I acquired for my depressed pops
'Cause, I like the rush more
I'm Herman Blume— don't get crossed
Amongst the privileged pissin' on groups of little kids
Litterin', mobbin', ignorant, flickin' off all the fed cars
It's young Reptar, duelin' with the Templar
Where the wicked and the sins are
Gettin' head with the Benz parked
My repertoire of records broken, every single check large
Once you gettin' M's you start to question who your friends are
Yeah, from out the dark the million men march
Ready, set, start (Ready, set, start)

[Interlude]
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Okay, said
The music secular, I'm givin' bitches dental work
Let the homies get a turn, man, them hoes just never learn
Some meth to burn and a connect that's 'bout to get some sherm
Tryna get so faded I forget that I was ever born (Yeah)
You new rappers is all the lil' homies
I need a bitch that sip 40's and keep the pistol for me
I'm finna O.D., I know it, I need to slow down my dosage
The money hittin' my phone but I don't answer, I'm loaded
See, I give a bitch the stale face
Good dick and a band-aid
That ass got a address, I come early like a tailgate
Painkillers before the liquor at a snail's pace
I treat the world like it's jail bait (Fuck it)
Yeah
And I am not your enemy
But I bring the devil that's temptin' me
Do not fear your ignorance, the open mind is infinite
I escape this prison, fit in better where the sinners live
I'm dealin' with urges emergin' from dark places
I try to hide 'em though
Lies I hide behind keep remindin' me I'ma die alone
Higher than I can handle, my mind is scrambled, I'm tweakin'
What do I believe in? All my dreams turn into demons and they thirsty
It's seven thirty, try my best to hurry
Victims don't get the mercy, nuttier than Eddie Murphy
Tardy to the party, now it's common knowledge
I'm a fuckin' problem
Yeah
I chew this shit, God bless me
You will respect me
It's all good, I got the Based God to protect me
Been smokin' less weed, meet my new friend Speed
I'ma fuck the world up 'til they forget me

[Intro]
Yeah
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Back when I didn't know myself (Yes, sir)
I thought I needed so much help (Yes, sir)
I wasn't yet grown, couldn't do it on my own
"I'ma make it," what I told myself (Okay)
Oh, how alone I felt (Okay)
Now they mouth right below my belt
Tell 'em they can go to hell
'Cause this shit just me, don't need no one else (Woo)
My records like phones, they sell (Sell)
No, I'm not done in this ring, better hold that bell (Bell)
Gimme a break of that Kit-Kat bar (Bar)
Who that famous bitch in that car? (Gosh)
Everybody run they mouth about somebody
You'da thought God said, "Fuck bitches, get money" (Ha)
Can we get a amen, and a milk and a honey?
Shit's real, how you feel? How you feel? Do you love me? (Yeah)
So let's get electric, majestic
Infected with sex and depressants
This fresh shit the best, just accept it
I've dealt with rejection, a lesson that I've learned (Learned)
All this hatred, I lack concern
'Cause I've waited long enough, it's my turn (Let's go)
Now lift that ass up, you want that match-up, you had to burn (Burn)
I do the work the universe assign me (Woo)
Who's the first to brew the human cure?
You disturbed she'll get peculiar
I was bringin' out juice into Troubadour
Excuse me, sir, I don't know who you confuse me fer (Uh-huh)
'Cause the raps colder than Jupiter (Uh-huh)

[?] Huge berserk, go the distance, Moon to Earth (Goddamn, woo)
Pluto's still a planet
Pluto's still a planet, if you ask me
Flow is crafty, no one's gonna catch me
Where are my idols? Now they old and saggy
Some of these rappers, dontcha know your daddy?
Know I'm batshit, go and blow an addy
Hoes is laughin' up in the backseat, shut they asses up, this ain't no taxi (Hoes, shut the fuck up!)
Throw an alley I oop it, all I do is make music (Music)
I don't take a break, been four days awake
Dedication, no bullshit (Bullshit)
The sky the limit, we roofless (Ya)
Don't got time for excuses (Ya)
Chasin' pussy so stupid
Swear to god I'ma die in this booth, shit (Whoa)

[Chorus]
What’s a Judist to Confucius? (Ya, ya, ya, ya)
What’s a Judist to Confucius? (Ba-da-da, die, die)
Yeah, I'm sick of dodgin' these bullets (Bullets)
And watchin' all of my movements (Bow)
As a kid, was so foolish, but I'm no longer a student
I still believe in dragons (Fire-breathing dragons, fire-breathing)
I still believe in dragons (Fire-breathing dragons, fire-breathing)
Yeah, this shit right here is so sacred (Ya)
Never lettin' 'em take it (Ya, ya)
Fuck your problems, everyone got 'em
Let's go to space and get faded (Die, die, die, die, woo)

[Verse 2]
It's 'bout time you respect the genius (Okay)
'Bout time everybody pledge allegiance (Okay)
Thin-skinned rappers have flesh anemic
Give 'em homicide, tell 'em, "Rest in pieces"
Imitators emulatin' TMZ shit (Uh-huh)
Ride the wave 'til they gettin' sea sick (Uh-huh)
In a league that they can't compete with
Nobody give a fuck who the second team is
Like a broken record, all these broken records
I'm immature though, I don't know no better
I'm at home watchin' episodes of Becker
With a cup of coco and a polo sweater
I'm only gettin' better, breathin' fire
Smokin' on a tenner, keep me higher
My flow, the loss of temper, easy violence
Death before surrender, no survivors

[Chorus]
What’s a Judist to Confucius? (I'ma get ya, ya, ya)
What’s a Judist to Confucius? (Ba-da-da, die, die)
Yeah, this shit right here is so sacred (Bullets)
Never lettin' 'em take it (Bow)
Fuck your problems, everyone got 'em
Let's go to space and get faded (Faded)
I still believe in dragons (Fire-breathing dragons, fire-breathing)
I still believe in dragons (Fire-breathing dragons, fire-breathing)
Yeah, this shit right here is so sacred (Ya)
Never lettin' 'em take it (Ya, ya)
Fuck your problems, everyone got 'em
Let's go to space and get faded (Ba-da, die, die, die, die, woo)

[Outro]
Still believe in dragons
(Oh my lord, how do you do it?)
Still believe in dragons
(Aren't you getting bored? Before this disaster and all this war)
Still believe in dragons
(Where's the light? Oh captain, my captain)
Still believe in dragons
(I could fly high like them dragons, but there's no such thing as dragons anyway)

[Verse 1]
You say you stand by your man
So tell me something I don't understand
You said you love me and that's a fact
And then you left me, said you felt trapped
Well some things you can explain away
But the heartache's in me 'til this day

[Chorus]
You didn't stand by me
No, not at all
You didn't stand by me
No way

[Verse 2]
All the times when we were close
I'll remember these things the most
I see all my dreams come tumblin' down
I can't be happy without you around
So alone I keep the wolves at bay
And there's only one thing I can say

[Chorus]
You didn't stand by me
No, not at all
You didn't stand by me
No way

[Bridge]
You must explain
Why this must be
Did you lie
When you spoke to me?
Did you stand by me?
No, not at all

[Verse 3]
Now I got a job, but it don't pay
I need new clothes, I need somewhere to stay
But without all these things I can do
But without your love, I won't make it through
But you don't understand my point of view
I suppose there's nothing I can do

[Chorus]
You didn't stand by me
No, not at all
You didn't stand by me
No way

[Verse 4]
You must explain
Why this must be
Did you lie
When you spoke to me?
Did you stand by me?

[Outro]
Did you stand by me?
No, not at all
Did you stand by me?
No way
Did you stand by me?
No, not at all
Did you stand by me?
No way
I know we don't talk much but you're but you're such a good talker, oh-whoa
Well I know we should take a walk but y'er such a fast walker, oh-whoa, well alright
I know where I'll be tonight, alright
Outta mind outta site

Well O.K., I know you don't love me but you'll still be thinking of me, oh-whoa
Well alright, I know you probably hate me, that's O.K. with me, alright

Outta mind outta site
Outta mind outta site
You don't see me now
You don't want to anyhow

Look out, here I come again and I'm bringing my friends
Look out, here I come again, I'm bringing my friends
OK alright OK alright
I know where I'll be tonight, alright
Outta mind outta site
Outta mind outta site
Outta mind outta site
I know you don't love me
I know you don't love me...

[Verse 1]
All my partners ask me why I take so much abuse
Why am I so faithful, honey? Why are you so loose?
They say why am I the one who never gets to take you home?
But they don't know the things you do to me when we're alone

[Chorus]
Irresistible bitch
I love the way you walk
Irresistible bitch
I love the way you talk
Irresistible bitch
And I really dig the way you kiss
Irresistible
Oh mama, I wish I could resist

[Verse 2]
Every Friday night I call your butt up on the phone
A deeper voice answers and says you're not at home
Now if you think that I'm a fool who'll go for any line
Then honey, put down all your money, you win every time

[Chorus]
Irresistible bitch
I love the way you walk
Irresistible bitch
I love the way you talk
Irresistible bitch
And I love the way way you kiss
Irresistible
Oh mama, I wish I could resist

[Ad lib]
Turn it up
Good lord
Turn it up
Good lord
Wait a minute

[Verse 3]
Hell if I know why I let you drive my car
Don't I know that walking won't get me very far?
Don't I know that crying over you is just in vain
But all things I lose don't add up to all the things I gain, 'cause

[Chorus]
Irresistible bitch
I love the way you walk
Irresistible bitch
I love the way you talk
Irresistible bitch
I love the way way you kiss
Irresistible
Oh mama, I wish I could resist

[Ad lib]
Turn it up
Turn it up
Turn it up
Turn it up
I want to say something

[Bridge]
Stole all my honey
Played it off like it was a joke
You're stealing all my honey, baby, keep you by my side
Bleed me till I'm broke

[Chorus]
Irresistible bitch
I love the way you walk
Irresistible bitch
I love the way you talk
Irresistible bitch
I love the way way you kiss
Irresistible
Oh God, I wish I could resist
Turn it up

[Verse 1]
If I can't wake up
Would you still... something else
If I can't return your corpse
No, I'm still involved

[Verse 2]
If I can't 

[?]
If I sit on the floor, on the floor
Can't you see?
He hurt her
How do you breathe
Without me?
How do you see me?

Haha, shut up Doja, you stupid

[Outro]
Uh-huh, honey
Hold up, hold up, bitch

[Verse 1]
She wakes up every morning
Just to do her hair, now
Because she cares, yeah
Her day just wouldn’t be right
Without her makeup
Never had her makeup
She’s just like you and me
But she’s homeless, she’s homeless
As she stands there singing for money

[Chorus]
La-da-dee-la-da-da, la-da-dee-la-da-da
La-da-dee-la-da-da, la-da-doo-la-da-da

[Verse 1]
In my sleep, I see her begging
Preaching, “Please, oh, oh, please”
Although her body isn’t mine
I ask, “Oh why, though?
Oh, why, oh, why, though?”
She’s just like you and me
But she’s homeless, but she’s homeless
As she stands there singing for money

[Chorus]
La-da-dee-la-da-da-da, la-da-dee-la-da-da-da
La-da-dee-la-da-da-da, la-da-doo-la-da-da-da

Woo!

Woo!
Pfffft, holy moly…

[Verse]
That shit don't bother me at all (No)
She say I'm too insensitive (Wait)
With her feelings empty inside (Ooh)
That shit don't bother me no more
Say it, L-O-V-E
I see I'm right back where I started (Ooh)
Started back where I started
Started, babe, oh
(At the beginning)
Started (Hol' up)
All over, all over again
Started
I see I started, started over again
Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room, you know, you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean, for sure
You're so freshed a doesn't sick as ca-cancer
You're sort a punk-rock, I grew on hip-hop

But you fit me better, than my favorite sweater
And I know, that love is mean, and love hurts
But I still remember that day, we meet on December, oh baby

[Chorus]
I will love you till the end of time, I would wait for a million
Years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (oh, baby)
Say you'll remember (oh baby, ohhh)
I will love you till the end of time

Big dreams, gangster
Said: "You have to leave to star, your life over"
I was like: "No please, stay here"
We don't need no money, we can make it all work
But he headed on Sunday, said come home Monday
I stayed waitin', anticipating and pacing
But he was, chasing, paper
"Caught in the game" that was the last I heard

[Chorus]
I will love you till the end of time, I would wait a million
Years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see throught the tears
Love you more than those bitches before

Say you'll remember (oh, baby)
Say you'll remember (oh baby, ohhh)
I will love you till the end of time

He went it every night, and baby that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did, I'd be your side
Cause I'm a ride or die, whatever fail or fly
Well, shit at least we tried
But when you walked to that door, a piece of me died
Don't you want any more, but he have any mind
Just want it like before, we were dancing all night
When they took you away, stole you all that my life
You just need to remember

[Chorus]
I will love you 'till the end of time, I would wait for a
Million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (oh, baby)
Say you'll remember (oh baby, ohhh)
I will love you till the end of time

[Verse 1]
Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room you know you made my eyes burn
It was like, James Dean, for sure
You're so fresh to death & sick as cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater and I know
That love is mean, and love hurts
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby!

[Chorus]
I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember
I will love you till the end of time

[Verse 2]
Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like - no please, stay here, we don't need no money
We can make it all work
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waitin', anticipatin' and pacin' but he was chasing paper
Caught up in the game - that was the last I heard

[Chorus]
I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember
I will love you till the end of time

[Bridge]
You went out every night
And baby that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did I'd be by your side
'Cause imma ride or die
Whether you fail or fly
Well s*** at least you tried
But when you walked out that door a piece of me died
I told you I wanted more, but that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before
We were dancin' all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember...

[Chorus]
I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember
I will love you till the end of time
Golden dawn breaks the darkness with its wrath of steel
Night to tests as long as will allows it to conceal

And oh, nobody loves you
When you're standing all alone
Oh, nobody loves you
When you're dead and gone

Giants walk the lands and ramble with their hammers high
Destroy their iron suits of ether for until they try

And oh, nobody loves you
When you're standing all alone
Oh, nobody loves you
When you're dead and gone

Grinding with his congregation walk with heads held high
Credence through the land no more, 'tis heads rolled by and by

And oh, nobody loves you
When you're standing all alone
Oh, nobody loves you
When you're dead and gone
My, my, my

Odin with his mighty wrath will smite a nights-a-foot
And in the bloody battlefields the rise of fire and soot

And oh, nobody loves you
When you're standing all alone
Oh, nobody loves you
When you're dead and gone (oh oh oh...)

Oh

Odin fell and Ragnarök took 

[?]
Colors are born and pain and dying then begin to fade

And oh, nobody loves you
When you're standing all alone
Oh, nobody loves you
When you're dead and gone

Oh

(My, my, my)
Oh
(My, my, my)
(My, my, my)
(My, my, my)
(My, my, my)
Oh

[Verse 1]
Sicker than the illest
Baby boy, you always kill it
It is razor sharp or crystal cut
Storming like a diamond in the rough, rough
We were always on another level
But now it feels like we are up in Heaven
Stars are flying, skies are opening now
Yeah, we'll always be together

[Pre-Chorus]
How you doing what you do to me, do to me?
How you doing what you do to me, do to me, baby?
How you doing what you do to me, do to me?
How you doing what you do to me, do to me?

[Chorus]
I'll be full of thunder
(What you do to me?)
Like a spectrum shining
(What you do to me?)
Struck me with your lightning
(What you do to me, do to me, do to me?)
(Baby, what you do to me?)

[Verse 2]
Better than the others
Introduce you to my mother
She gon' like you, yeah, I know she will
You're the sweetest like a sugar pill, pill
Hangin' out in your Mercedes Benz
I'ma ride with you until the end
Hit the gas, we're burnin' up like fire
Yeah you always take me higher

[Pre-Chorus]
How you doing what you do to me, do to me?
How you doing what you do to me, do to me, baby?
How you doing what you do to me, do to me?
How you doing what you do to me, do to me?

[Chorus]
I'll be full of thunder
(What you do to me?)
Like a spectrum shining
(What you do to me?)
Struck me with your lightning
(What you do to me, do to me, do to me?)
(Baby, what you do to me?)

[Intro]
This is my song
This is, this is my song
For real, no doubt
This is my song
This is, this is my song
This is, this is my song
For real, no doubt
This is—

[Verse 1]
The V.I.P. is too crowded for me
I think found somewhere better, better
Like the dance floor, where the shawties be
I see one, I'ma go get her
And whoa, little mama
Never seen nobody like this
And you now I want ya
And you number one, number one on my list

[Pre-Chorus]
Like hey, for sure, there's a whole lot of girls in here
Hands up, saying hey, this my song
She's so gone off that bottle of Patrón
So turned up tonight
And I won't let you go 'cause you drunk and I'm on
So stay tonight
'Cause it's early, it's 1:30

[Chorus]
And the club don't close before
And the girls gon' let me give 'em, give 'em some drinks tonight
Shawty, shawty, look good, sexy, think she ready
Only one thing on my mind
So I said, "Wassup? Wassup with you, girl?"
"W-W-Wassup? Wassup? What it do, girl?"
So I said, "Wassup? Wassup with you, girl?"
Mess around and buy the whole bar, I'ma buy the whole bar

[Verse 2]
Are you tipsy? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I think I'm tipsy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I don't think shawty's no stripper but I'm gon' tip her
'Cause I got money to blow
And I been poppin' bottles all mornin'
Tell me what you want and
I'ma give it to you for sure

[Pre-Chorus]
Like hey, for sure, there's a whole lot of girls in here
Hands up, saying hey, this my song
She's so gone off that bottle of Patrón
So turned up tonight
And I won't let you go 'cause you drunk and I'm on
So stay tonight

[Chorus]
And the club don't close before

So I said, "Wassup? Wassup with you, girl?" (Oh-whoa, oh-whoa)

[Outro]
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

[Chorus]
Ya playin'
Throwin' that name all up on me
Ya playin'
Knowin' damn well that you want me
I'm tired of waitin', conversatin'
Why you playin' game, games?
Makin' love all in the club
Give a fuck about your name, name
Ya playin'
Throwin' that name all up on me
Ya playin'
Knowin' damn well that you want me
I'm tired of waitin', conversatin'
Why you playin' game, games?
Makin' love all in the club
Give a fuck about your name, name

[Verse]
Look, ha
What you playin' for?
I can see it in your eyes, you ain't 'bout that shit
I'm pelican fly, I left the windows inside it
I got it rainin' in this bitch
Dollar after dollar
Don't play with a nigga, hop up on this dick
One drunk night will change your life
Now you famous, bitch
Okay, I'm off that Ace and that Rosé
José, no way
I'm swevin'
With the white CÎROC and that OJ
Molly? I think I know her face
I know them titties real but that ass fake
I keep runnin' with the money at a fast face
So baby girl, just meet me at the valet
Tell your girls to pick your car up
Tell her you rollin' with me
And you gon' call that bitch tomorrow
First thing in the mornin', cookin' me breakfast
You wearin' my necklace
So girl, why the fuck you out her flexin'?
Fuckin' with these peasants? What?

[Chorus]
Ya playin'
Throwin' that name all up on me
Ya playin'
Knowin' damn well that you want me
I'm tired of waitin', conversatin'
Why you playin' game, games?
Makin' love all in the club
Give a fuck about your name, name
Ya playin'
Throwin' that name all up on me
Ya playin'
Knowin' damn well that you want me
I'm tired of waitin', conversatin'
Why you playin' game, games?
Makin' love all in the club
Give a fuck about your name, name
Hey, wake up, your eyes weren't open wide
For the last couple of miles
You’ve been swerving from side to side
You're gonna make me spill my beer
If you don't learn how to steer

Passenger side, passenger side
I don’t like riding on the passenger side

Roll another number for the road
You're the only sober person I know
Won't you let me make you a deal
Just get behind the wheel

Passenger side, passenger side
I don't like riding on the passenger side

Should've been the driver, could've been the one
I should've been your lover, but I hadn't seen

Can you take me to the store, then the bank?
I’ve got five dollars we can put in the tank
I’ve got a court date coming this June
I'll be driving soon
Passenger side, passenger side
I don’t like riding on the passenger side
I don't like riding on the passenger side
You always wanted more time
To do what you
Always wanted to do

Now you got it
And I, I must be high
To say goodbye
Bye bye bye

You never said you needed this
Now you're pissed that you missed
The very last kiss
From my lips

And I, I must be high
To say goodbye
Bye bye bye

And you never looked in my eyes
Long enough to find
Any peace of mind
But now you got it, and I
I must be high
To let you say goodbye
I must be high
Bye bye bye
Bye bye bye
Well the money's pouring down and the people all look down
And it's floating out of town
I hit the second deck and I spend my paycheck
And my wife that I just met, she's looking like a wreck

Casino Queen, my lord you're mean
I've been gambling like a fiend on your tables so green

I always bet on black, blackjack
I'll pay you back
The room fills with smoke and I'm already broke
And the dealer keeps on joking as he takes my last token

Casino Queen, my lord you're mean
I've been gambling like a fiend on your tables so green

Casino Queen, my lord you're mean
I've been gambling like a fiend on your tables so green
Who were you thinkin' of
When we were makin' love
Last night?
Was it a good-lookin' stranger
Or a close friend of mine?

You didn't wanna quit
When we were into it
Last night
Who were you thinkin' of
When we were lovin' last night?

Who were you thinkin' of
When I was makin' love
To you?
There was a smile on your face
I ain't seen for a while

You got more out of it
Than I put into it
Last night
Who were you thinkin' of
When we were lovin' last night?
Who were you thinkin' of
When we were makin' love
Last night?
Was it a good-lookin' stranger
Or a close friend of mine?

You didn't wanna quit
When we was into it
Last night
Who were you thinkin' of
When we were lovin' last night
Who were you thinkin' of
When we were lovin' last night
Never doubting
Always faithful
She returns
She said she loves me
And I could always
Come to her

She can't imagine how
Another lover
Could have made her turn

And I'm so grateful
That I'm still willing
To have her home
And I'm so grateful
That I'm still willing
To have her home

She said she loves me
She won't forget me
Then she's gone
She thinks that later
We could pick up the pieces
And carry on

And I forgive her
Never suspecting
She could be wrong

And I'm so grateful
That I'm no longer willing
To have her home
And I'm so grateful
I'm no longer willing
To have her home
After the show you walked right past
Arms reached out for your autograph
And as you flashed your backstage pass
I caught your eye with a camera's flash

When the band came out they stood behind you
Cymbals crashed, the lights went blue
You stood alone in the halo's haze
Shinny guitar hung on gold lamay

And you, you were the lonely one
You were the lonely one
When you perform it's so intense
When the critics pan I write in your defense

I understand I'm just a fan, I'm just a fan
When I get home I turn off the alarm
I've checked the phone, no messages on
I play the ones from yesterday

I play you're song just to hear you say that....
You, you're the lonely one
You are the lonely one
You, you're the lonely one
You are the lonely one
Got a box full of letters
Think you might like to read
Some things that you might like to see
But they're all addressed to me
Wish I had a lotta answers
'Cause that's the way it should be
For all these questions
Being directed at me
I just can't find the time
To write my mind
The way I want it to read
You'll come back again
And I'll still be your friend
I got a lot of your records
In a separate stack
Some things that I might like to hear
But I guess I'll give 'em back
I wish I had a lotta answers
'Cause that's the way it should be
All these questions
Being directed at me
Just can't find the time
To write my mind
The way I want it to read
You'll come back again
And I'll still be your friend
I can't find the time
To write my mind
The way I want it to read
Just can't find the time
To write my mind
The way I want it to read
We've got solid state technology
Tapes on the floor
Some songs we can't afford to play
When we came here today

All I wanted to say was how much I miss you
Alcohol and cotton balls
And some drugs we can't afford on the way
When we came here today
We all felt something true
Now I'm red-eyed and blue
Well I can't tell you anything
You don't already know
I keep on trying
I should just let it go

I keep on singing
Your eyes, they just roll
It sounds like someone else's song
From a long time ago

You already know the story
And the chords are just the same
You already know I love you
And I sound like what's his name

But you can't stop me
I want you to know
I know it sounds like someone else's song
From a long time ago
There's rows and rows of house, with windows painted blue
With the light from the t.v. running parallel to you
But there is no sunken treasure, rumored to be
Wrapped inside my ribs in a sea black with ink

I am so out of tune with you, I am so our of tune with you
If I had a mountain, I'd try to fold it over
If I had a boat (or bone), you know I'd probably roll over
And I leave it on the shore, I'd leave it for somebody

Surely there's somebody who needs it more than me
I am so out of tune with you, I am so our of tune with you
All the leaves will burn and autumn fires then return
All the fires we burn, all will return

Music is my savior, and I was maimed by rock and roll
I was maimed by rock and roll
I was tamed by rock and roll
I got my name from rock and roll
Theologians
They don't know nothing
About my soul
About my soul

I'm an ocean
An abyss in motion
Slow motion
Slow motion

Inlitterati lumen fidei
God is with us everyday
That illiterate light
Is with us every night

Theologians
That don't know nothing
About my soul
Oh they don't know

They thin my heart with little things
And my life with change
Oh in so many ways
I find more missing every day
Theologians

I'm going away
Where you will look for me
Where I'm going you cannot come

No one's ever gonna take my life from me
I lay it down
A ghost is born
A ghost is born
A ghost is born

I'm an ocean
I'm all emotion
I'm a cherry ghost
Cherry ghost

Hey I'm a cherry ghost
A cherry ghost
Oh, hold on
You risk exciting me
Once in Germany someone said "nein"
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9

Oh, hold back
Oh, don't invite me
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9
Once in Germany someone said "nein"

I'm a wheel
I will
Turn on you

Oh, I invented a sister
Populated with knives
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
I'm a wheel
I will
Turn on you
Um...

I'm a wheel
I will

I'm a wheel
I will

I'm a wheel
I will
Turn on you

I'm gonna turn on you, turn on you
Turn on you, turn on you, turn on you

I'm gonna turn on you, turn on you
Turn on you, turn on you, turn on you

I'm gonna turn on you, turn on you, turn on you
How to fight loneliness
Smile all the time
Shine you teeth til meaningless
Sharpen them with lies

And whatever's going down
Will follow you around
That's how you fight loneliness

You laugh at every joke
Drag your blanket blindly
Fill your heart with smoke

And the first thing that you want
Will be the last thing you ever need
That's how you fight it

Just smile all the time
Just smile all the time
Just smile all the time
Just smile all the time
Impossible Germany
Unlikely Japan

Wherever you go
Wherever you land
I'll say what this means to me
I'll do what I can

Impossible Germany
Unlikely Japan

The fundamental problem
We all need to face
This is important
But I know you're not listening
Oh I know you're not listening

If this was still new to me
I wouldn't understand

Impossible Germany
Unlikely Japan
But this is what love is for
To be out of place
Gorgeous and alone
Face to face

With no larger problems
That need to be erased
Nothing more important than to know
Someone's listening
Now I know
You'll be listening
Hey, wake up, your eyes weren't open wide
For the last couple of miles you've been swerving from side to side
You're gonna make me spill my beer
If you don't learn how to steer
Passenger side, passenger side
I don't like riding on the passenger side
Roll another number for the road
You're the only sober person I know
Won't you let me make you a deal
Just get behind the wheel
Passenger side, passenger side
I don't like riding on the passenger side
Should've been the driver, could've been the one
I should've been your lover, but I hadn't seen
Can you take me to the store, then the bank?
I've got five dollars we can put in the tank
I've got a court date coming this June
I'll be driving soon
Passenger side, passenger side
I don't like riding on the passenger side
I don't like riding on the passenger side
Times right now ain't nothin' like they used to be
Well times right now ain't nothin' like they used to be
You know I'll tell you all the truth, won't you take my word from me

Well I seen better days, but I ain't puttin' up with these
Well I've seen better days, but I ain't puttin' up with these
I had a lot better time with those women down in New Orleans

Well I was born in the country so she thinks I'm easy to lose
Well I was born in the country so she thinks I'm easy to lose
She wants to hitch me to a wagon and drive me like a mule

I bought her a gold ring and I pay the rent
I bought her a gold ring and I pay the rent
She tried to get me to wash her clothes but I got good common sense

Well if you don't want me then why don't you just tell me so?
Well if you don't want me then why don't you just tell me so?
It ain't like I'm a man that ain't got nowhere else to go

I give you sugar for sugar, but all you want is salt for salt
I give you sugar for sugar, but all you want is salt for salt
Well if you can't get along with me, then it's your own fault
Well, you want me to love you, but then you just treat me mean
Yea, you want me to love you, but then you just treat me mean
You're my daily thought and you're my nightly dream

Well, sometimes I think that you're just too sweet to die
Ah, sometimes I think that you're just too sweet to die
And other times I think that you ought to be buried alive
I'd like to rest my heavy head tonight
On a bed of California stars
I'd like to lay my weary bones tonight
On a bed of California stars

I'd love to feel
Your hand touching mine
And tell me why
I must keep working on

Yes I'd give my life
To lay my head tonight on a bed
Of California stars

I'd like to dream
My troubles all away
On a bed of California stars

Jump up from my starbed
Make another day
Underneath my California stars
They hang like grapes
On vines that shine
And warm the lovers' glass
Like friendly wine
So I'd give this world
Just to dream a dream with you
On our bed of California stars

I'd like to rest my heavy head tonight
On a bed of California stars
I'd like to lay my weary bones tonight
On a bed of California stars

I'd love to feel
Your hand touching mine
And tell me why
I must keep working on

Yes I'd give my life
To lay my head tonight on a bed
Of California stars

I'd like to dream
My troubles all away
On a bed of California stars

Jump up from my starbed
Make another day
Underneath my California stars
They hang like grapes
On vines that shine
And warm the lovers' glass
Like friendly wine

So I'd give this world
Just to dream a dream with you
On our bed of California stars

So I'd give this world
Just to dream a dream with you
On our bed of California stars

(Dream a dream with you)
I was chewing gum for something to do
The blinds were being pulled down on the dew
Inside-out of love
What a laugh, I was looking for you

Saxophones started blowing me down
I was buried in sound
Taxicabs were driving me around
To the handshake drugs I bought downtown
The handshake drugs I bought downtown

...poorly, I felt like a clown
I felt like someone I used to know
I 's feeling alright
And if I ever was myself, I wasn't that night

It's okay for you to say what you want from me
I believe it's the only way for me to be exactly
What you want me to be

It's okay for you to say what you want from me
I believe it's the only way for me to be
Exactly what you want me to be
Oh, I was chewing gum for something to do
The blinds were being pulled down on the dew
Inside-out of love
What a laugh, I was looking for you

The saxophones started blowing me down
I was buried in sound
The taxi cabs were driving me around
To the handshake drugs I bought downtown
To the handshake drugs I bought downtown

I felt like a clown, they were translating poorly
I looked like someone I used to know
And if I ever was myself, I wasn't that night

Oh, it's okay for you to say what you want from me
I believe it's the only way for me to be
Exactly what you want me to be

Exactly what do you want me to be?
Exactly what do you want me to be?

[Verse 1]
Maybe I'm just a kid
Maybe I just don't fit in
I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready, I'm ready to go now

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna go to school
But I don't get to make the rules
Too early, too early
Too early, too early in the morning

[Chorus]
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Has to do something they don't wanna do
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Has to do something, oh, why's that true?

[Verse 3]
Maybe I'm not so bad
Maybe I just don't fit in
I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready, I'm ready for more now

[Verse 4]
But I don't wanna go to bed
So much going on in my head
Not tired, not tired

Oh my goodness
Uh

[Verse]
I turned my mansion to a juug house
I did a TV show with Jesse off of Full House
Oh lord, I turned my mansion to a ho house
I did a show way in Haiti, bought the Zoes out
I rolls out in the car with the head missing, the hoes out
Closed mouth, don't get fed shit in the cold drought
Old south habits, I pour it up, you pour it out
I left the court house with a stroll, bounce and no doubt
I know I'm no slouch if Hov vouch, my doors sprout
I help my bro out and get him out the dope house
I never sold loud since that old couch that fold out
Like the pronounce that I am on a whole ounce
Stank so loud like old trout and toes out
Make these hoes crouch, then roll, bounce, then roll out
And kick rocks, I started with six rocks, oh lord (Woo)
Let it breathe
I started off with six rocks
Made 30 dollars, thank god for hip hop
Didn't stop, I was gettin' guap, gotta diddy bop
And hit the block with my palms itching like chicken pox
Bop jiggy bop, my niggas hot, my bitch a fox
All you niggas mock, you bit my swag like little crocks
Don't give diddly squat 'bout any man or city cops
Pistol in my sock, no lollipops, we lickin' shots
Moms cooked dinner and then the pots went to my pops
He was whippin' rock around the clock, oh, how I watched
Then I got shot and then I dropped, then went in shock
Laid up in that hospital room, soon as the doctor knock
You know I hopped up, bounced back like boom shakala
Got rich at 15 and moved momma out
Got lit at 15, ooh, cotton mouth
Started off with six rocks, it's a mountain now
Ooh, and I ain't climbin' down
I never been a fan of common grounds
I been gettin' green since Bobby Brown
Been meaning to write my wrongs, but I been too busy to jot 'em down
And when you visit, I'm not around
I hope your view isn't from out of bounds
I come to do business, so for your new niggas disguising frowns
When your crew fishing, your body's found
Oh lord, I turned my mansion to the White House
Did a movie with Forest Whittaker, got my lines down
Ooh, but my mansion still a ho house
Did a show at home, bought my bros and no foes out
I rolls out in the coupe with the doors out, the whores out
My flow is like a shoe with the soles out, Dr. Scholl's vouch
I knows how to move with my nose down
Keep my nose out of people business, news and hoes' mouth 'cause these hoes foul
My pops from the goose, I'm from Eagle Street, Hollygrove child
I used to have the Nissan with Bose sound, I drove around
Chrome 44 with the gold snout, take your crown
Extended clip that poke out, reload rounds
Sex with a bitch, deep stroke, ouch, she so aroused
Next to the bitch is a coke pile, your hoes mouth
Mine goes down, swallows child with no chow
That mean no teeth, holy cow, slow it down
Yeah, I guess I'm hoin' now
I never been a fan of knowin' vows
I been gettin' green, I mean more than cows
Been meaning to settle down, but I be jugglin' hoes like a clown
And if she gullible, I like her style
If she bisexual, I dyke her out
And if she flexible, if she flexible, I'll wrap her 'round
Get head and pussy, call it cap and gown
Oh lord

[Outro]
No ceilings
No feelings
You all in your feelings
I'm like fuck your feelings
Mannie Fresh on the beat

[Intro: Ant Clemons]
Dear ones, we are looking to bring you enlightenment
To offer illumination in stormy skies
We are here as beings of light
Benevolent, invested in humanity and her evolution
Telling my brothers to stay calm, though
Turned to a Mothra, bro, this that Godzilla
Turned to a monster, more like Othello
Phantom of the opera, it goes where it goes
My nightmares still haunt me
When I sleep, they haunt me
When I sleep, they haunt me
And my nightmares, they haunt me
But I won't let 'em get the best of me

[Chorus: Quavo]
I can dance with the devil, but I can't try to be God (Dance, nope)
Damn, that's kinda odd, let you try to be better (Odd, you)
Put these bitches on the pedestal (Bitch)
I'mma eat her like an edible (Eat it up)
They love him, they call him incredible (Incredible)
They say fuck him he fresh out the medical (Fresh out the)
Medical, Medical, Medical

[Verse 1: Quavo]
She a bad bitch from out of town, she pop like this (Pop it, yeah)
Stop runnin' 'round town, sayin' you fucked my bitch (Quit cappin', stop it)
Them young niggas runnin' down, we run right in (Runnin' in, runnin' in, runnin' in)
I'm not talking 'bout a man unless it's Ben (No, Benjamin Franklin, racks)
She wanna go to the sunken place, told her to giddy up, ándale
(Giddy up, sunken place!)
Put you in brand new fabrics, let you go drip on the runway (Woop, drip)
Demons they shake off my back when I walk into church on a Sunday (Help me, God!)
Niggas don't know how to act, so that's why I bought a new AK
(It go brrat, rah)
Chopper bullet gettin' off, everybody runnin' off (Hey, go)
Bad bitches love my dog (Bad)
Send 'em back, they tell it all (Send 'em back, brrrrrrt, hey)
Only taking one call (One call, brrrrt)
I'm not taking no calls

[Chorus: Quavo]
I can dance with the devil, but I can't try to be God (Dance, nope)
Damn, that's kinda odd, let you try to be better (Odd, you)
Put these bitches on the pedestal (Bitch)
I'mma eat her like an edible (Eat it up)
They love him, they call him incredible (Incredible)
They say fuck him, he fresh out the medical (Fresh out the)

[Verse 2: Offset]
She a dime out the ghetto
New Patek, now she walk the high pedestal
Popped the Perc' down her throat like an edible
I don't hang with no broke, they ineligible
Put her on a jet, then I put her on flex
Look at that ass, it stupid, Tourette's
Do the whole dash and I pray I don't wreck
Buy a bitch an ass, she was sittin' on flats
Watchin' my back, don't slap, go attack
Hoppin' in the hatch, Richard Mille max
You wanna offer me a mil', you can have the deal back
Sticks in the field kill, pull your weave back
Pull her hair, break her back like a Kit Kat
Give my dog a bone, that's a whole hunnid' racks
Hit 'em with a sig in the stomach, six pack
Serve a nigga bags, rob him, that's a recap
Bitch, give me neck 'til you break your kneecaps

[Open Verse]

[Verse 1]
High, ultraviolet sky
Break a thousand hearts with a secret smile
Don't need no reason why, I do it 'till I die

I promised on my life
Promised that I've changed, but it's all a lie

[Verse 1]
Lookin through my bible, searchin for a song to sing
Heard a beautiful man done passed away
And I really wonder why Lord, did you take him from me
See heaven's the only place that he needs to be
And I know that you never felt pain, pain like you feel today. Please remember this when I say, you got a set of wings today

[Chorus]
Heard ya got your set of wings today, open em up and fly away
I heard ya got your set of wings today, open em up
You see the world don't deserve your love no more
The Lord done opened up Heaven's doors for you
C'mon, walk on through. Walk on through, yea

[Verse 2]
Peaceful, loving, true, and kind
Was the father friend of mine
Drinks like funny and keepin it real
They both were a part of Mr. Hill
Memories will keep afloat, got a heart so genuine. (So true)
And he's smiling down us on now, said he's smiling down on us now

[Chorus]
Heard ya got your set of wings today, open em up and fly away
Heard ya got your set of wings today
I know you got your set of wings
See the world don't deserve your love no more
Lord done opened up Heaven's doors for you, walk on through
He opened em up for you. Yes, he did, gon walk on through
He opened em up for you

[Outro]
Dedicated to the loving memory of Mr. Micheal Hill, the Hill family, and any other family that's lost, somebody
That they cherished and loved
Mr. Hill used to always tell me to say "I'm proud of you, boy"
Used to have that smile, that big Koolaid smile.  he a Cool dude man
We miss you, already, we miss you. Rest in peace

[Chorus]
The world don't deserve your love no more
The Lord done opened up Heaven's doors for you. Walk on through. Heard ya got your set of wings today, open em up and fly away
Heard ya got ya set of wings today, open em up and fly away
Verse 1:
There must be some way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth

Verse 2:
No reason to get excited, the thief, he kindly spoke
There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late

Verse 3:
All along the watchtower, princes kept the view
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl
Swinging in the backyard
Pull up in your fast car
Whistling my name
Open up a beer
And you say get over here
And play a video game

I'm in his favorite sundress
Watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown

I say you the bestest
Lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on

Go play a video game

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby, now you do
Singing in the old bars
Swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame
Kissing in the blue dark
Playing pool and wild darts
Video games

He holds me in his big arms
Drunk and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of

Watching all our friends fall
In and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby, now you do
(Now you do)
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby, now you do

[Verse 1]
Every night I stay up 'til 3 AM and fantasize
Are you mine or are you playing round pretending that I'm blind?
I've got an awful habit
I chase the wild once it's so problematic
I guess it's in my blood
I keep second guessing, I need the pain to survive
Feels so good when you're bad to me

[Pre-Chorus]
You're on my mind and I can't shake it
Tried every time, and I can't shake it
Two hearts collide, and I can't shake it
I can't stop can't get enough

[Chorus]
Lost in your eyes, and I can't shake it
It's suicide, and I can't shake it
But I'm alive, and I can't shake it
I can't stop can't get enough

[Verse 2]
It's pretty bad
Yes I'm kinda crazy, I'm a heart attack
It's a fact, all the others think that I'm a maniac
You know that I'm addicted
To all your poison arrows and your kisses
I guess it's in my blood
I keep second guessing, I need the pain to survive
Feels so good when you're bad to me

[Pre-Chorus]
You're on my mind and I can't shake it
Tried every time, and I can't shake it
Two hearts collide, and I can't shake it
I can't stop can't get enough

[Chorus]
Lost in your eyes, and I can't shake it
It's suicide, and I can't shake it
But I'm alive, and I can't shake it
I can't stop can't get enough

[Bridge]
I've been hurt before
Baby, it's the truth
Your love is a sign
It makes my heart beat
Boom-boom-beh
It's like a boom-boom-beh
It's like a boom-boom-beh
I'm coming back tonight
Boom-boom-beh
It's like a boom-boom-beh
It's like a boom-boom-beh
Can't shake you off of my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
You're on my mind and I can't shake it
Tried every time, and I can't shake it
Two hearts collide, and I can't shake it
I can't stop can't get enough

[Chorus]
Lost in your eyes, and I can't shake it
It's suicide, and I can't shake it
But I'm alive, and I can't shake it
I can't stop can't get enough

[Outro]
And I can't shake it
And I can't shake it
And I can't shake it
And I can't shake it
As you move through the world
As you move through the world
As you move through the world
I can 

[?] and comfortable in your house

[Verse 1]
I got this knot inside my throat, call my vodka up if I come
And I'm not suicidal, I just drink to forget my problems
Seems like the kids these days are all just lookin' to get higher, oh
I'm just the same, anything's I won't tell momma and father

[Pre-Chorus]
Want it all and we want it now
Do anything to not come down
Get my fix someway, somehow, today

[Chorus]
You know, you know just how it goes
We're just stoned, leave us alone
Ain't nothin' wrong, it's cool at home
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned

[Drop]
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned

[Verse 2]
I got my woman, got my high, my guitar, and some money
And I'll be goddamned if these fuckers try to take that from me
But ain't shit wrong with us and don't tell me, "Talk to somebody"
I'm drunk at 2 p.m., treat every day like it's a Friday

[Pre-Chorus]
Want it all and we want it now
Do anything to not come down
Get my fix someway, somehow, today

[Chorus]
You know, you know just how it goes
We're just stoned, leave us alone
Ain't nothing wrong, it's cool at home
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned

We're good as gold, we're all just stoned
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned

You know, you know, just how it goes
We're just stoned, leave us alone
Ain't nothing wrong, it's cool at home
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned

Pole by my waist side, waste no time
Kiss you bye, gone in the mean time
Hasta la vista, wave you bye
Catch you on a flip side

[Verse 1]
Gone in the mean time (Outta there)
Got hoes all around town (Everywhere)
Gold locked in the safe now (Papa bear)
Hoes, hoes more, hoes no Christmas (Holiday)
Yeah, but you know I'ma slay
But you know I'm still gon' slay, though
Shit, might even make it rain there
Them bells gon' ringing
Name ringin' bells, Kris Kringle
Slang her D in silence, Django
Head shot to the face like Tango
You gon' shoot me in a broad day, though, Franco? (Pop)
On my Dean like James, though
But you know I'ma slay shit
But you know I'ma slay, though, Buffy
Lots of these niggas blood sucky'
Ah, but I never really was an angel
Hop in my new Uzi Vert'
Pedal to the metal, tires in the dirt (Skrrt)
Hit my favorite Kurt Angle (Skrrt)
Drift, fuck around, might pull up on the curb (Damn)

[Chorus]
Hit two vibes, hoes on the east side
Pole by my waist side, waste no time
Kiss you bye, gone in the mean time

I know things that you don't know
I know why the flowers grow
Not because they're watered right
Not because they see the light
Just because I love you

I know things that you don't know
Why it rains and why it snows
Not because the heavens cry
Not because of a cloudy sky
Just because I love you

You can try to figure it out
But things like this are just unannounced
It might not make sense
'Cause I haven't told you yet
That I love you
That I love you
Oooh

I know things that you don't know
All my thoughts, I'll never show
Not because I'm unprepared
Not because I'm somewhat scared
Just because I love you
Just because I love you

[Verse 1]
There's so many people in this open world
Doing things they don't understand
Just tryna find happiness
And touch the feeling with their hands
See all the kids are stuck on Instagram
And all our soldiers fighting wars for no reason
When you hurt nobody gives a damn
They pull out phones and start recordin' just to post it and delete it, I know, oh-oh
I won't be a hypocrite, I've been in your position and I've had my share of laughs before
But that don't mean that I'm not tryna grow

[Chorus]
'Cause I can be a helping hand
If, all that I can give you is a helping hand, yeah, oh-oh
'Cause I can be a helping hand
If, all that I can give you is a helping hand, yeah, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
What examples are we setting for the kids?
I stopped and gotta ask myself that question
We show 'em things they don't understand
And not the lessons every one forgot to mention
I don't wanna be a hypocrite, I'm not the best at influencing it either
But me I'm just like you and we're just tryna grow
'Cause how growing as everyday people

[Chorus]
'Cause I can be a helping hand
If, all that I can give you is a helping hand, yeah, oh-oh
'Cause I can be a helping hand
If, all that I can give you is a helping hand, yeah, oh-oh

They're in love with this idea of love
It's a shame that they'll believe it will come
For us all, for us all

Pull up with a stick, three thou' shots, André
Top of the world, **** get starstruck, I just be oiled up
Calm my nerves, hangin' with narcos, shoot like vato

[Verse]
All stares as she walks into the room
Hopeless as I'll ever be, I could not know from where I stood
I'm a nuisance, think about a lot
I used to pray to you, not sure that you forgot

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, son, won't you listen to your mother?
It would be much easier to understand each other
Time and time again, I'm always looking for the right one
I can help you get there, but I can't promise an outcome

[Chorus]
Don't you want it?
I can see it
Right there in your eye
Love me, baby
Love me lately
Want you in my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, dear, won't you listen to your brother?
It would be much easier if you were like the others

Don't you want it?
I can see it

[Verse 1]
I bet we're higher than the people on Cloud 9
This connection got me feeling like I've known you my whole life, wow
Even our shadows know each other in the light
So why do I think of losing you when you're right by my side? Uh

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not really thinking clear
Too good to be true and that's what I fear
Like what if you left me here
And I fill the floor with my sequin tears?
I start getting in my brain
Something I do that I can't explain
Wicked love's creepin' up

[Chorus]
So baby, don't you let go (Ah-ah)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco if it ain't me
And baby, if you ever (Ah-ah)
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco if it ain't me

[Verse 2]
I got a little devil dancing in my mind
Playing tricks on my imagination, ruining my night, wow
I try to shake it off by looking in your eyes
All the voices in my head keep tryna tell me it's goodbye, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not really thinking clear
Too good to be true and that's what I fear
Like what if you left me here
And I fill the floor with my sequin tears?
I start getting in my brain
Something I do that I can't explain
Wicked love's creepin' up

[Chorus]
So baby, don't you let go (Ah-ah)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco if it ain't me
And baby, if you ever (Ah-ah)
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco if it ain't me

[Bridge]
I'm not really thinking clear
Too good to be true and that's what I fear
Like what if you left me here
Like what if you left me here
And I fill the floor with my sequin tears?

[Chorus]
So baby, don't you let go (Ah-ah)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco if it ain't me

[Chorus: Dan Caplen and Macklemore]
Oh, I wish it was '99, when I was a kid at Christmas time
Couldn't go to bed that night
Santa Claus sliding, snow in the driveway
Under the lit-up Christmas tree with my crazy-ass family
Singing, oh, oh oh, oh (I got it)
Wish I was a kid at Christmas again (Alright)

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Now, fill up the gas in the SUV
Spent way too much time tryna pick out our tree
The ceiling ain't as tall as we thought, I see
Gotta cut a couple inches off the top to proceed
And now we stringing the lights up
Five hours later, we stringing the lights up
Listenin' to Bing Crosby by the fire
Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Mariah
Turn off that Michael Bublé
Turn on that one movie about the kid
Who licked the telephone pole on the Blu-ray
Red Ryder BB-Gun, stayin' up all night
Jimmy Stewart, It's A Wonderful Life, now am I right?
The collar's puffy, the beard is long
The belly's tubby, but the reindeer are strong
It's Santa Claus
It's Christmas time!

[Chorus: Dan Caplen]
Oh, I wish it was '99, when I was a kid at Christmas time
Couldn't go to bed that night
Santa Claus sliding, snow in the driveway
Under the lit-up Christmas tree with my crazy-ass family
Singing, oh, oh oh, oh
Wish I was a kid at Christmas again

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Now, I wrap presents like a kid wearing mittens
Blindfolded, with a pair of left-handed scissors
Janky, but the gift inside? Ridiculous
Better than whatever it is you had on your wishlist
Dig in, then whip up the Bisquick
Go outside, and throw 'round the pigskin
I'm a dad now, but still feel like a big kid
Best time of year, can I get a "amen"? (Amen)
The Almond Roca, the hottest cocoa
The track around the tree with the locomotives
I wanted a Jordan poster to measure my growth spurt
Starter logo, Georgetown Hoyas
I'm going off of the head, y'all
Homemade cookies that I dip in the eggnog
I wanna take a second, and shoutout my dead dog
Toby, he's dead

[Chorus: Dan Caplen]
Oh, I wish it was '99, when I was a kid at Christmas time
Couldn't go to bed that night
Santa Claus sliding, snow in the driveway
Under the lit-up Christmas tree with my crazy-ass family
Singing, oh, oh oh, oh
Wish I was a kid at Christmas again

[Outro: Dan Caplen]
Oh, I wish it was '99, when I was a kid at Christmas time
Couldn't go to bed that night
Santa Claus sliding, snow in the driveway
Under the lit-up Christmas tree with my crazy-ass family
Singing, oh, oh oh, oh
Wish I was a kid at Christmas
Oh, oh oh, oh
Wish I was a kid at Christmas again
It's Christmas time!

[Verse 1]
Silent night, holy night!
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

[Verse 2]
Silent night, holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing 'Alleluia!
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born

[Verse 3]
Silent night, holy night!
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord, at Thy birth
Jesus Lord, at Thy birth

...The settlement enables the company to continue making Oxycontin. According to the terms of the agreement, the Sackler family, owners of Purdue, will not be required to admit any wrongdoing. In other news today, NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch completed the first all-female spacewalk when they ventured outside of the International Space Station to replace a power controller. In Dallas, Texas, Amber Guyger has been found guilty of murder. Guyger, a white off-duty police officer, claims she mistakenly entered the apartment of her upstairs neighbor, Botham Jean, because she was distracted by her sexting with a fellow officer. Guyger claimed that upon entering the apartment, she felt fearful for her safety and felt justified in drawing her service revolver and shooting Jean dead. Guyger has been sentenced to ten years in prison. The Supreme Court is reviewing a Louisiana law that would effectively end women's access to abortion. The law, seen as a first step by evangelical conservatives toward the possible reversing of Roe vs. Wade, flies in the face of public opinion. The health and safety of women across the nation, particularly those from lower-income homes are especially vulnerable. Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House Chief of Staff, threw the Trump administration's defense against impeachment into disarray on Thursday when he said that the White House withheld nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine to further President Trump's political interests.

[Verse 1]
Let me look inside your funky mind
Let's take a ride to the place where love gets made
I need direction to your dimension
I— am not afraid to die
Cause Heaven got no gravity
I'ma float away, my spaceship make it out this galaxy
Have you seen the world beyond the boundaries?
I feel your love around me
I'm safe in outer space
And these vibrations will create a high
I was made to fly, on my way up
Let it ride, and away I'ma take ya

[Chorus]
I'ma space traveler
(Let me take you on a ride)
I'm an outer space traveler

(As I wander through my crazy brain)

[Verse 2]
Will you let me lift the sins within your soul?
I fear I've lost control
The devil lives inside my home
Yeah, I lost my mind while tryin' to find forever
Tryin' to buy adventure
Feel the music set you free
I just want to live inside the ecstasy
Do you trust in your reflection?
(Love yourself)
Are you stuck in one direction?
(Move yo body, mo-move yo body)
Will you find your way to Heaven?
(Will you make it out alive?)
Yeah, before the world ends?
Yeah, before the world ends?

[Chorus]
I'ma space traveler
(Let me take you on a ride)
Liquor say the magic word

[Verse 3]
Yeah, he a space traveler
Off the liquor he a wizard, say the magic words

Flow creatin' massacres
Gettin' back to work to feed the scavengers

Yeah, every day a payday— peep the calendar
Yeah, the flow is mathematics, speakin' algebra
I'm a rare breed, don't nobody scare me
The shit again
It's Fisherman, Larry

[Intro]
You know you can't help but, but feel good when you hear this song
Yeah, uh

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack frost nipping at your nose
Yule tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Will help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes on the glow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loading lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mothers child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from 1 to 92
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you
You, you, you, you, yeah
Ah yeah
If I ain't got you with me, baby
Yeah, I need you, need you this Christmas
Well, well, I need you

[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Verse 1]
There's a time that I remember, when I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever, and everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy

Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Verse 2]
There's a time that I remember when I never felt so lost
When I felt all of the hatred was too powerful to stop
Now my heart feel like an ember and it's lighting up the dark
I'll carry these torches for ya that you know I'll never drop, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy

[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through (Ooh, yeah)
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you

That's on period to let you know
I'm so serious, bitch, that's the code

[Verse 1]
Oh, we have fallen
As a whole
And we're sinking
Down a hole
Without thinking
About our loved ones
Who might be shrinking
Into a sunken space
With glass surrounding
Their powers
That are pounding
In their temple
In their mind
There seems to be a complexity
To being kind
To your space
To your temple
To your neighbors
Who've seen the changes
We all feel change
Some of us wear masks
To hide the pain
And I just wish I could ask

[Chorus]
Qadir, oh, what's the deal now?
What did you plant in your mother's garden?
Qadir, oh, I miss you dearly
What did you plant in your mother's garden?

[Verse 2]
Oh, hemos sido esclavos
To these systems
That project false beauty
Exorcisms
Burn it out of my body
This dependency don't help nobody
We're sitting in dark rooms
With bags on our heads
Waiting for God to touch us
We just wanna be closer
It's overwhelming
Some of us wear masks
Because some can't adapt
Oh, I just wish I could ask

[Chorus]
Qadir, what's the deal now?
What did you plant in your mother's garden?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Qadir, oh, I miss you dearly
What did you plant in your mother's garden?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
Oh, we have fallen
As a whole
And we're sinking
Down a hole
Without thinking
About our loved ones
Who might be shrinking
Into the sunken space
With glass surrounding
Their powers
That are pounding
In their temple
In their mind
There seems to be a complexity
To being kind
To your space
To your temple
To your neighbors
Who've seen the changes
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We all feel change
Some of us wear masks
Because we can't adapt
I just wish I could ask
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
(Man) Calisthenics in my head
Do I, do I get it? What's to get?
'Cause after a while, it just don't seem that bad
Nothin' enough 'til it's over
Where were you headed when I left you?
Why couldn't you just wait around?
And I know that after a while, it just won't seem that bad
What should I do for now?

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, it just ain't that bad

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Slow down before everything change
24/7, now I say, "Things are lookin' up"
But I could be drunk, I just—
Hold onto my arm one time
If you get dizzy, that's fine
Just don't get stuck, and fall
Down, down, down, down
Brand new submarine
Down, down, down, down
In a brand new submarine

Stretch one leg down, put the other one, touch your knees

East Atlanta Chicken talkin nigga

I paid twenty thousand dollars for this beat just to bang in the club
Five thousand for a choppa man I'mma shoot somethin up

[Verse ]1
My Wonder Woman bracelet match my He-Man watch
My Batman car made Cat Woman stop
This Spiderman Kush is sticky as a spider web
And it's so loud that you can smell it in Fort Lauderdale
Three ex men fell victim to my .40 cal
Little smurfs tryna act like they was Gargamel
I'm Gatman Gucci, know I keep a Joker gun
The AK with a loaded shawty red drum
"It's a bird"  "it's a plane" "nah it's supermane"
Girlfriend please, nah that's just Gucci Mane
My swag change like im rapping with another brain
I go hard spongebob nigga you a lame
Like Garfield, Odin, Nigga, I'mma dog
And whatchu call that, man I call it chicken talk
Like Bugs Bunny, big money, got a lotta cash
A shotgun like Elmer Fudd to kill these dirty wabbits

[interlude]
Cheya.. It's Gucci, nigga
It feels like I'm a down south 50 (50cent) nigga
I feel like I'm east side Busta Rhymes right now
Two chains on, three bracelets, nigga
In my two seater, nigga
Copped it off the showroom floor, nigga
What's up, Marquis Daniels, I see you, nigga
Ball player money like I play for the Pacers with you, nigga
What's happenin?
Ah, Pimp C. UGK, bitch!

[Verse 2]
I smoke purple weed, purple as Barney dog
That crack rock done turned your mama to a Island Bar
That cat with the pack, mix it with the isotol
The Grinch stole christmas, Gucci just stole eighty pounds
If I could change a carton, I would change once
I'd make Jerry chase Tom with a handgun
Fifty five tweety birds in my white truck
I'm still pissed cause my cousin smoked my last blunt
I still got it like that nigga with that weak kush
Short temper, throwin fists, like I'm Heathcliff
Sellin babies, in the 6, call em little bills
Twelve fifty for a baby that's a good deal
A transformer Benz sittin on some slick wheels
Bright yellow rims, same color my Bart Simp
I say go go gadget then the car cranks
Go steady pussy nigga, step up his car game

[Interlude: Shawty Redd & Gucci Mane]
Ayo, Gucci Mane.. listen, i've got good new, and i've got bad news
The good news is, your album sells just tripled, you got shows going over sea for triple the profit my nigga
Bad news is, your best friends snitchin on you
Whatchu gonna do about that my nigga?

Shit, everybodies snitchin on me, nigga
I don't even keep no phone, nigga
My hoes cain't even keep up with me
It's Gucci Mane

[Verse 3]
See I'm a junk yard dog, not a Scooby Doo
I got that white girl, true, I'm talking Betty Boo
A hundred gallons of that yellow, talk that Winne Poo
So if I pull this Hummer over I'mma make the news
The way I'm spittin on the mic it's like I'm Daffy Duck
And I ain't Richy Rich, bitch, but I'm rich as fuck
Got Shawty Redd on the track, that's a lot of change
Then man this beats gonna bang for a hundred days
Strip club, dance club, every DJ
Gucci Mane and Shawty Redd, fuckin let it play
Throw some money in the air, we gon make it rain
Rotten niggas get sprayed tryna make a name
A thunk it long, King Kong, then I took his chain
But I gave it back cause our diamonds wasn't the same
See you can keep it mane, I'm gonna step it up a tad
It's Gucci Mane and this song is Nickolodeon

[Intro]
Mmm
I ain't tryna (Ah)
I ain't tryna
I ain't tryna

[Verse 1]
Yeah, ain't tryna be cool like you
Wobblin' around in your high heel shoes
I'm clumsy, made friends with the floor
Two for one, you know a bitch buy four
And two left feet, you know I always drop
First thing a girl did was a bop
I'm the whole damn cake and the cherry on top
Shook up the bottle, made a good girl pop

[Pre-Chorus]
You ain't even here to party
Ken in the club, tryna pipe a Barbie
I don't wanna go, go, go with the flow
Backbend 'til I touch my toes
I don't wanna row, row, row the boat
Wrist full of rocks and I hope I float
Big up yourself 'cause you know they don't
I chew, chew, chew, 'cause they hope I choke

[Chorus]
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss, I'ma shine like gloss
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss, I'ma shine like gloss
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss, I'ma shine like gloss
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss, I'ma shine like gloss

[Verse 2]
Said bitch, I'm the after, you been the before
I been the stallion, you been the seahorse
Don't need a report, don't need a press run
All of my bad pics been all my best ones
I wear the hat and I wear the pants
I am advanced, so I get advance
And I do my dance and cancel the plans
Said boo, don't be mad 'cause you had the chance

[Pre-Chorus]
Drop, said I took it and I ran for it
I won it, then I stand on it
Money on the floor when we dance on it
Shine bright, let them put a tan on it
Said I took it and I ran for it
I won it, then I stand on it
Money on the floor when we dance on it
Shine bright, let them put a tan on it like

[Chorus]
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss, I'ma shine like gloss
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss, I'ma shine like gloss
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss

[Verse 1]
You got a mansion and a really nice car
Diamonds for breakfast and you're living like a superstar
You're on the guest list with your VIP friends
Keep checking your phone for the number of the girl you met
You got your contacts and you think you're hooked up
You're friends with DJs and you're on stage when you're in the club
But you can’t buy me with your labels and bills
Won't stop you trying, I was going in for the kill

[Pre-Chorus]
Toys and boys playing games with no names
Can't you see, it's just so basic
I still gotta know

[Chorus]
Do you think you're cool enough?
(To hang around with me)
Do you think you're cool enough?
(To taste this candy)
You might be putting on a good show
And you're talking like you're a pro
But you're not cool enough to be my baby

[Verse 2]
I hurt your feelings, now the cat's got your tongue (Question, q-)
Now you're still being chewed up like bubblegum
Do my words sting you like the smoke in your eyes?
You keep on trying
Tryna get me, no big surprise

[Pre-Chorus]
Toys and boys playing games with no names
Can't you see, it's just so basic
I still gotta know

[Chorus]
Do you think you're cool enough?
(To hang around with me)
Do you think you're cool enough?
(To taste this candy)
You might be putting on a good show
And you're talking like you're a pro
But you're not cool enough to be my baby

[Chorus]
Do you think you're cool enough?
(To hang around with me)
Do you think you're cool enough?

You might be putting on a good show
And you're talking like you're a pro
But you're not cool enough to be my baby

[Chorus]
Do you think you're cool enough?

You might be putting on a good show
And you're talking like you're a pro
But you're not cool enough to be my baby

[Chorus]
Do you think you're cool enough?

Do you think you're cool enough?

Please hold while I connect you to a rock hard wet gec
That's just dying to talk to you

[Verse 1: Dorian Electra]
I hear your sighs
But can't see your eyes
I don't know what your real name is
But I want you so bad
I don't know how to be alone
I'm always pickin' up the phone
'Bout to make my call
I'll charge it to my card, I'll pay the fee
'Cause I know that love ain't free (Hey)

But I like to pretend that you love me
But every time imaginin' you— me
Close my eyes, I almost feel you hug me
'Til the time is up, I think I need to run, and
Almost went and threw my phone into the lake, yeah
So addicted to the love although its fake, yeah
And don't you know I wanna meet you face to face? Yeah
But I know that you're not real and I can't make ya

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who were dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
*Lyrics from Snippets*

[Chorus: Drake]
You live a double life and your mouth run like you get two lives
You're loose with it
You know my Startrax niggas, they produce with it

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
...my buisness
Only take the pistol out your mouth to talk business, fuck niggas
I feel like Papa John's, I got a rocket launcher
I give you rocket science, I do math and slime

[Verse 1: Kacey Musgraves]
Take my hand, let's run
I'll bring my arrows, you bring your gun
Cloud of smoke
I don't know where, but I wanna go

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves]
It's in the sky, it's in the air
If I get lost, I'll meet you there
We can't stop, 'til we find our place
Let's saddle up and ride away

[Drop: Kacey Musgraves]
Let's ride away
Let's ride away
Mmm, let's ride away
Let's ride away

[Verse 2: Kacey Musgraves]
Hold on tight to what we have
When it's this good, you don't look back
Tiny doves on the horizon
Yeah, you and me, quicker than lightning

[Chorus 2: Kacey Musgraves]
Over canyons and over plains
Let's saddle up and ride away

[Drop: Kacey Musgraves]
Let's ride away
Let's ride away
Mmm, let's ride away
Let's ride away

[Outro: Kacey Musgraves]
Mmm, let's ride away

[Verse 1]
If you think I couldn't hold my own, believe me, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If it ain't so awful and we're all together, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If you think I couldn't roll with you, believe me, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If ideally we should feel like this forever, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can

[Chorus]
(And she said) Seems you're coming on
Breathe a little deeper
Should you need to come undone
And let those colours run
(And she said) Now you're having fun
So do this and get through this
And come find me when you're done
So we can be as one

[Verse 2]
If you think I couldn't hold my own, believe me, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If you need someone to tell you that you're special, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If you need someone to carry on, believe me, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If you think no one is feeling what you're feeling, I am
Believe me, I am, believe me, I am

[Bridge]
And the groove is low

[Chorus]
(And she said) Seems you're coming on
Breathe a little deeper
Should you need to come undone
And let those colours run
Now you're having fun
So do this and get through this (And the groove is low)
And come find me when you're done
So we can be as one

[Refrain]
Telemona
Telemona, oh
And the groove is low
Telemona
And the groove is low

[Chorus]
Seems you're coming on
Breathe a little deeper
Should you need to come undone (Telemona)
And let those colours run
Now you're having fun (Telemona)
Do this and get through this
And until we see the sun (And the groove is low)
You're my number one

[Refrain]
Telemona
(And she said)
And the groove is low
Telemona
And the groove is low

We're both adults while we behave like children
Long as we got enough to keep on living

Angels, Witches
Angels, Witches

[Verse 1]
Demonic, exotic, exotic, demonic
I pop Oxycodone like antibiotic
Textin' my phone, right now I'm on molly
It got me perspiring like I'm in Somalia
I should be more careful, right now I be wildin'
I could be more helpful, could not be more stylish
She could be my devil, she might be my goddess
It could be Satanic, it might be platonic
I tip my hat to her, she'd rather dollars
I drip a bath for her, she'd rather shower
She turned her back on me, I just massage her
Knew we were a match, didn't know we started fires
A bird is a plane? If it is, it's a private
Swerve in the lane, she either hit me or dodgin'
Meet me at the crossroads in the middle of rush hour
On end of the road, boys and men don't die

[Chorus]
Yeah, angels and witches (Angels and witches)
Bengals and kittens, swingers and hitters (Yeah)
Singles and sinners (Yeah)
Ankles, physicians, the pictures, the painters (Buh)

You got me sleepless, sleepless in Miami (Yeah)
You got me twinkling, so bright, bitches tanning (Yeah)
You got me thinkin' that love may be magic (Yeah)
You got me beefing with your baby daddy (Pew)
You got me sleepless, sleepless in Miami (Yeah)
You got me sleepless when I'm on a xanny (Yeah)
You got me sleepless, it might be the Addy
You got me creepin' inside my own mansion
(But you got me sleepless, sleepless in Miami)
You got me sneakin' and I got you snapping
When we be sleeping, you topless, no panties
You let me sleep right behind you, you nasty
You let me sleep, deep inside you, you savage
We never sleep, when we try, we get nasty (Yeah)
You never dream, if you do, I'ma catch you
You say don't skeet, if I do you gon' catch it, you nasty

[Chorus]
Yeah, angels and witches (Angels and witches)
Bengals and kittens, swingers and hitters (Yeah)
Singles and sinners (Yeah)
Ankles, physicians, the pictures, the painters (Buh)
The sick one, the sane one (Yeah)
The lit one, the lame one, the mistress, the main one (Buh)
Witches and angels (Yeah)

[Bridge]
You got me sleepless (Sleepless)
Sleepless in Miami (In Miami)
Yeah, you cut me deep, yeah
Deep in thought while I'm deep inside of you
Damn, that's deep (That's deep)

[Verse 3]
Hate me, love me, love me, hate me
Kiss me, bite me, suck me, taste me
Been around the world and 

[?]  I can't find my baby
I've been lookin' for the right one
Play one, wife one, main one, side one
Got a angel that I gotta die for
Adam, Eve, apple cider
Angel be killing me softly (Softly)
The witch, she be makin' it hard for me (Hard for me)
The witch on my broom, can't get off of it (Off of it)
She wear her halo with two horns through it (Woah)
Flap your wings, them shits vanilla white (Oh)
Feathers everywhere, no pillow fight (Oh)
My morning angel and my witch at night
Give me kiss of death, now I feel alive

[Bridge]
Angels, witches
Angels, witches (Angels)

Witches and angels (Angels)
Pretty and painful (Painful)
Pretty and painful, angels and witches
Deranged and delicious (Delicious)

[Chef]
Ladies and gentlemen, the hardest working man in show business, Mr. Elton John!

Got this bug-eyed girl
Cold hand on my knee
Frozen teeth chitter, chatter
She's dressed up like a cemetery
Like a cemetery

Snowbound all winter
Blue lips on my cheek
Little tongues prattlin', rattlin'
Talkin' about them hometown geeks
Them hometown geeks

Wake up Wendy, smell the coffee
Help me into your custom kitchen
Gimme a cup of that old black magic
I want to get me some of that old home cookin'
Can you feel it, it's chilly and freezin'
Wake up Wendy, moods a changin'
I got a reason, and you got a feelin'
Wake up Wendy, love's in season
Feels like a steam clean
When she washes me
Clouds a bustin', pumps a hissin'
Just peel me off the ceiling
Off the ceiling

Oh, chill out, bug-eyed-girl
Zap me into cinders
Pop the thermal mumbo jumbo
Melt me with your little fingers
With little fingers

Wake up Wendy, smell the coffee
Help me into your custom kitchen
Gimme a cup of that old black magic
I want to get me some of that old home cookin'
Can you feel it, oh, it's chilly and freezin'
Wake up Wendy, moods a changin'
I got a reason, and you got a feelin'
Wake up Wendy, love's in season
Wake up Wendy, love's in season
Wake up Wendy, love's in season

[Verse 1]
Feels like I'm not where I'm supposed to be
I don't fit in with these familiar faces
And the games they play don't mean a thing to me
I know there's so much more

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can't stop dreamin', and thinkin'
Maybe I could be someone different
More than a yearbook memory
If I leave this, I'm riskin' almost everything
Am I on the right road?

[Chorus]
Outta the old, I've gotta find my way
Into the new, give anything it takes
I wanna know, if no one knew my name
Would my wildest dreams feel like home?
If I go out of the old (Ayo, ayo)
And into the new (Ayo, ayo)
Out of the old (Ayo, ayo)
And into the new (Ayo, ayo)
Yeah, I wanna know (Ayo, ayo)
If no one knew my name
Would my wildest dreams feel like home?
Out of the old

[Verse 2]
I wish these streets were still enough for me
I wish this town could give me everything
But I still feel stopped while every light turns green
Why can't I let it go?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can't stop dreamin', and thinkin'
Maybe I could be someone different
More than a yearbook memory
Leavin' all this, I'm riskin' almost everything
But there's only one road

[Chorus]
Outta the old, I've gotta find my way
Into the new, give anything it takes
I wanna know, if no one knew my name
Would my wildest dreams feel like home?
If I go out of the old (Ayo, ayo)
And into the new (Ayo, ayo)
Out of the old (Ayo, ayo)
And into the new (Ayo, ayo)
Yeah, I wanna know (Ayo, ayo)
If no one knew my name
Would my wildest dreams feel like home? (Ayo, ayo)
Out of the old (Ayo, ayo)

[Outro]
And into the new (Ayo, ayo)
Take me out of the old (Ayo, ayo)
And into the new (Ayo, ayo)
'Cause I wanna go
I wanna go
Mmm
Just take me
I miss the drip in the back of my throat
Sometimes I miss my bloody nose
Two heads underwater, together we drowned
But nothing feels better when you're coming down
Nothing feels better when you're coming down

There's nothing that I won't believe
Waves are crashing over me
When a beautiful voice makes an awful sound
Well nothing feels worse when you're coming down
Nothing feels worse when you're coming down

He said, "I need air, I need space"
One of us will die in this place
I see the fire through these clouds
I'll never have to feel it if I never come down
Never have to feel it if I never come down
Never have to feel it if I never come down

No mirrors on the table
No cab to the Chelsea Hotel
When it's freezing cold and I'm not able to tell
I see the rooftops disappear
How did I end up down here?
Am I falling asleep or blacking out?
Need you here if I ever come down
Need you here if I ever come down

It's the first time in months I've slept a whole night
You never once left my bedside
But don't you worry about me now
Just hold my hand and lay me down
Hold my hand and lay me down
Hold my hand and lay me down
Nothing feels better when you're coming down

[Intro]
Wop
East Atlanta Santa
Jumpin' out the Phantom
Huh, go

[Chorus]
Jingle bales, bales on the scale (Bale)
Fish scale same color as (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Tryna duck the feds (Fuck 'em), just bust a nigga head (Bah)
'Cause this nigga tried to play with my bread (Huh? Pussy)
Jingle bales (Jingle), motherfuck 12 (Fuck 'em)
I'ma drop a bag on your head (Wack 'em, kill 'em)
The neighbors won't tell (Nah), and we left no shells (Bah)
It's a dead man 'sleep in your bad (Ooh, go)

[Verse]
Jingle, jingle (Jingle), I'm Kris Kringle (Santa)
Tryna stack my chips up (Yeah), tall like Pringles
The work came darker, the price got cheaper (Cheap)
Coke like Christmas and pints like Easter (Pink)
Wrestlin' with the work, get in the kitchen like Batista (Rrah)
Shake the pot, shake the pot, shake it like a seizure (Skrrt)
Charge your boy the super high, sell it 'fore it's even dry
Gucci the executive (Gucci), but I don't wear a suit and tie
Dressed super fly, I'm too rich for even Uber rides (No Uber)
Can't even go outside (No), everywhere I'm recognized (Ooh)
Gucci Mane a model now, they need me to advertise (Yeah)
Pull up in an Avatar, hybrid with some stupid ice
She stalkin' me, she jockin' me, she watch me like a private eye
Mob guy, wise guy, your boyfriend a small fry (Small)
Drop top, wintertime, 'cause I can't be the fall guy (Brr)
Ballin' till you fall out (Ball), I just tried to buy the mall out (Oh, damn)

[Chorus]
Jingle bales (Jingle), bales on the scale (Bale)
Fish scale same color as (Skrrt, skrrt)
Tryna duck the feds, just bust a nigga head (Bah)
'Cause this nigga tried to play with my bread (Wack 'em, hoo)
Jingle bales (Jingle), motherfuck 12 (Fuck 'em)
I'ma drop a bag on your head (Damn, damn)
The neighbors won't tell (Nah), and we left no shells (Bah)
It's a dead man 'sleep in your bad (Ooh)

[Verse 1]
Do you remember we were standing here a year ago?
Our minds were racing and time went slow
If there was trouble in the world, we didn't know
If we had a care, it didn't show
But now I worry our horizon's been nothing new
'Cause I get this feeling and maybe you get it too
We're on a rollercoaster stuck on its loop-de-loop
'Cause what we did one day on a whim
Has slowly become all we do

[Chorus]
I never wanted any other way to spend our lives
I know we promised we'd be doing this 'til we die
And now I fear we might
Ooh, now I fear we might

[Post-Chorus]
But it's okay
I think there's a way
Why don't we just say, "One more year"? (One more year)
Not worryin' if I get the right amount of sleep (One more year)
Not carin' if we do the same thing every week (One more year)
Of livin' like I'm only livin' for me (One more year)
Of never talkin' about where we're gonna be (One more year)
One more year
Of livin' like the free spirit I wanna be

[Bridge]
We got a whole year (One more year)
Fifty-two weeks
Seven days each
(One more year) Four seasons, one reason, one way
One year (One more year), one year
One year, from today
From today

[Outro]
I never wanted any other way to spend our lives
Now one of these is gonna be the last for all time
For all time
One more year

[Verse 1]
We were hangin' in the morning
Feelin' all different kinds of things
We were talkin' about everything
From the past to the happenin'
We started talkin' 'bout devotion
The kind that goes on eternally
And I tell her I'm in love with her
But how can I know that I'll always be?

[Chorus]
She just said, "Is it true? Is it true? Tell me now"
That's a promise I can't make and I won't validate
Was I in some kind of mood? I don't know, I don't care
Now I'm sleeping in my room, here I am, back again
She's in my—

[Verse 2]
I was happy just listening
No intention to be mentioning
We started talkin' 'bout the future
'Bout the notion I was motioning
I'm just so terrified to face her
Like any moment I might wake up
'Cause she's the only thing I think of
I told my mother that I love her

[Chorus]
She just said, "Is it true? Is it true? Tell me now"
That's a promise I can't make and I won't validate
Was I being immature? I don't know, I don't care
Now I'm sleeping in my room, here I am, back again
She's in my—
In my—

[Outro]
I said, "We'll see, we'll see" (In my—)
We'll see
Ah, we'll see
We'll see
We'll see, we'll see, we'll see
See how it goes
Until we know what the future holds
Ah, we'll see
We'll see
We'll see, we'll see, we'll see

[Verse 1]
Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
How was I to know?
How was I to know this high came rushing?

[Chorus]
We're on the borderline
Dangerously fine and unforgiven
Possibly a sign
I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday

[Verse 2]
Here I go
Quite a show for a loner in L.A.​
I wonder how I managed to end up in this place
Where I couldn't get away

[Chorus]
We're on the borderline (Ooh)
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time
Watched it speedin' by like a train
Like a train

[Refrain]
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be so in love?
Any closer? Close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the sun
(Comes the sun)

[Verse 3]
Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
Rudy said it's fine
They used to do this all the time in college (If you and I get comfortable)

[Chorus]
And we're on the borderline (Ooh)
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time
Watched it speedin' by like a train

[Refrain]
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be so in love?
Any closer? Close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the sun
(Comes the sun)

[Verse]
Made a transformation
Black fortune, took Katrina, trust a nation
Mostly something on a sensation
Genius, brilliance, strong, resilience
We in the buildin'
Oh that’s beautiful, I'm just rappin' right now James
Rap, wrap the Rolex
No more something, just owe less
That ain’t something, you holy
No I'm literally on the mic, rappin' while you FaceTime me

[Verse 1]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Don't say it 'cause I know I'm cute (Ooh, baby)
Gucci down to my drawers
LV all on my shoes (Ooh, baby)
I be drippin' so much sauce
Got me lookin' like RAGÚ (Ooh, baby)
Lit up like a crystal ball
That's cool, baby, so is you
That's how I roll

[Pre-Chorus]
If I'm shinin', everybody gonna shine (Yeah, I'm goals)
I was born like this, don't even gotta try (Now you know)
I'm like chardonnay, get better over time (So you know)
Heard you say I'm not the baddest, bitch, you lie

[Chorus]
It ain't my fault that I'm out here gettin' loose
Gotta blame it on the Goose
Gotta blame it on my juice, baby
It ain't my fault that I'm out here makin' news
I'm the pudding in the proof
Gotta blame it on my juice

[Post-Chorus]
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya, ya-ya, ya-ya
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
Ya-ya, ya-ya, ya-ya, ya-ya
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice

[Verse 2]
No, I'm not a snack at all
Ooh, baby, I'm the whole damn meal (Ooh, baby)
Geoffrey, you ain't bein' slick
Don't dare try to cop a feel (Ooh, baby)
The juice ain't worth the squeeze
If the juice don't look like this (Like this, like this)
Hold up, baby, please
Don't make me have to take your ooo!

[Pre-Chorus]
If I'm shinin', everybody gonna shine (Yeah, I'm goals)
I was born like this, don't even gotta try (Now you know)
I'm like chardonnay, get better over time (So you know)
Heard you say I'm not the baddest, bitch, you lie

[Chorus]
It ain't my fault that I'm out here gettin' loose
Gotta blame it on my Goose
Gotta blame it on my juice, baby
It ain't my fault that I'm out here makin' news

Gotta blame it on my juice

[Bridge]
Somebody come get your man
I think he got lost in my DMs, what? My DMs, what?
You better come get your man
I think he wanna be way more than friends, what?
Way more than friends
What you want me to say?

[Chorus]
It ain't my fault that I'm out here gettin' loose
Gotta blame it on the Goose
Gotta blame it on my juice, baby
It ain't my fault that I'm out here makin' news
I'm the pudding in the proof
Gotta blame it on my juice

[Post-Chorus]
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice

Money stacked up too high, ain't no way I'm fallin' off (No)

Killin' these hoes, it's a massacre
Every time she pull up, fuck it up

Love when we fuck, it's rough as fuck
She snuck in that Derringer
Don't run up on us, don't try your luck
Broke niggas keep tryin' her (What?)

Rich niggas keep flyin' her
So it's gettin' hard to keep in touch

Spendin' M's and it's on ice
Spendin' M's and it's on ice
Spendin' M's and it's on ice

True story
I used to hate Christmas
For real

[Verse 1]
On the first day of Christmas, my true love sent to me
A half of a brick, told me feed my family
I took it to the hood, then I dropped it in the sink (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Then I whipped it into a whole thing
Jumped off the porch early, man it was '93
I had old hoes on my dick when I was 13 (Facts)
On the second day of Christmas, I bought an MC
Supersport and I set it on G’s
Wopped so many niggas had to paint that bitch green
I'm the Grinch that stole Christmas, nigga ask about me
On the third day of Christmas, my old plug sent to me
Ten milk jugs full of pills and like eighty bales of weed
On the fourth day, said, "Fuck that shit," went on a spree
I got niggas still want payback for shit did in '03
It’s vibe, what the fuck you want a fifth and on the sixth
On the seventh day of Christmas, got a new drum for the stick (Wack' em)

[Break]
Shit funny now
Ain't funny then, yeah
Fuck it

[Verse 2]
On the eighth day of Christmas, I got into a beef (I did)
Ninth day of Christmas, they beggin' me for peace (They did)
Tenth day of Christmas, they callin' up police (Chill)
Niggas try to stop it, but they started it with me
Rentals called the house, they gon' terminate the lease (No)
Eleventh day of Christmas, put our shit out on the streets (Fuck)
Twelfth day of Christmas, got my momma losin' sleep
It might be Christmas to you, but just another day to me

[Outro]
I hate Christmas

J. White, I need the beat I can go off on

[Chorus]
You changed on me, Mr. Wop
You're not the same Gucci Mane from the block
And you're so mean to the meanest
And your bling is the cleanest
And your chains must be worth a lot
You're not the same to me, Mr. Wop
With all the planes and the rings and the watch
You're the worst and you know it
You got cash and you blow it
And your things must be worth a lot

[Verse 1]
I don't like Gucci Mane, shawty changed on me
He ain't the same, there's somethin' about him, there's somethin' strange to me
Maybe the money or the clothes or the jewels he rock
He don't just wear the watch, he abuse the wok
So outlandish man, that they can't stand the man
I'm a living urban legend just like Candyman
Nose candy man, I served it hand to hand
Sniper rifle like a soldier in Afghanistan
I let my money and my car do all the talking (Cha-ching)
I'm the Grinch, I'll put an artist in a coffin (Uh)
Fuck a dog, I'll let my gat do all the barking
Know you a bitch, but you a pussy, you's a softy

[Chorus]
You changed on me, Mr. Wop
You're not the same Gucci Mane from the block
And you're so mean to the meanest
And your bling is the cleanest
And your chains must be worth a lot
You're not the same to me, Mr. Wop
With all the planes and the rings and the watch
You're the worst and you know it
You got cash and you blow it
And your things must be worth a lot

[Verse 2]
When you hit a lick I'll be the fence (Be the fence)
I'll loan you money when you in a pinch (In a pinch)
You gotta pay me back really quick (With the quickness)
Gotta charge ya interest, nigga, I'm the Grinch (I'm the Grinchy)
Had a murder charge but they couldn't convict (Can't convict me)
If the glove don't fit you must acquit (You must acquit)
Got a Jewish lawyer runnin' my defense
Let me out before the gavel hit the bench
I'm the Grinch that made ya eat that other bitch
Mistletoe on my dick, I made 'em kiss
These broke niggas mad 'cause they on the bench (They on the bench)
I'm on the courtside, ballin' like Swish (Swish)

[Chorus]
You changed on me, Mr. Wop
You're not the same Gucci Mane from the block (The Grinch)
And you're so mean to the meanest
And your bling is the cleanest
And your chains must be worth a lot (Yuh)
You're not the same to me, Mr. Wop
With all the planes and the rings and the watch
You're the worst and you know it
You got cash and you blow it
And your things must be worth a lot (Go)

Low down dirty piece of shit, you ain't gang to me (Nope)
I'm a stand-up nigga, you sittin' pissin', not the same as me (Damn)
'Terrogation room, shoulda thought, "What would Gucci do?" (Gucci)
I'd rather rot in my cell wearin' shower shoes (Damn)
Fuck the police, that's my thoughts, I make power moves
How you turned state on your boys? That's a coward move (Damn)
12-gauge hit you and your boy, it's so powerful
Knocked his head off like a toy, it's so powerful (Damn)

[Outro]
What would Gucci do? Yeah
Stand up like a man? That's what Gucci would do
Turn state, be a snitch? That's what a coward does

Money ain't shit, let a broke trick tell it (True)
If the green right, then Gucci might chef it

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Rich The Kid]
Now she say she miss me (Now she say she miss me)
But every time I'm gone then she try to diss me (Then she try to diss me)
But then I let her kiss it, then she say she miss me (Now, I got her kissin' on it)
But if you miss it then fuck me, baby, fuck me like a mistress (Fuck me like a mistress, baby)
And I'ma fuck you like the first day out the penitentiary (Rich)

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
I fucked her good, but she can't tell nobody (Nobody)

Cash out, no stoppin'
I tell her, "Miss me" (Miss me)
"When I'm gone, don't try to diss me" (Huh?)
I done fucked on all her friends, they against me (Rich)
Whip with a fryin' pan (Whip)

Ooh, pussy so damn good, she got her bag again (Her bag again)
Ayy, fuck her in her Benz, she can't drive again (Skrrt)
Ooh, she fancy 'cause she cashin' in

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Now she say she miss me (Now she say she miss me)
But every time I'm gone then she try to diss me (Then she try to diss me)
But then I let her kiss it, then she say she miss me (Now, I got her kissin' on it)
But if you miss it then fuck me, baby, fuck me like a mistress (Fuck me like a mistress, baby)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
They say Magic City super lit, so I pulled up in front of it
Bitches on my summer drip and I just brought out some of it
When they see all these racks I'm orderin', they get so disorderly (Ching, ching)
My new AP so watery, it make her pussy watery (Wow)
I told her, "Pick a chick, pretty and thick"
She wanna see in front of me (Oh, yeah)

When they see all these racks we orderin', pussy start gettin' watery (Wop)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm like, "Nah, nah, nah, nah," I got so much money now
Couple 'round me 'fore the fucker came out (Swear, wop)
I used to pull up to Club M, smokin' on a half an ounce
Rockin' Jordans 'fore the fuckers came out (Yeah)
First I took over the South, took the golds out my mouth
I woke up with a motherfuckin' ghost in my house (Damn)
I'm a gold mouth idiot, I'm not with that silly shit (Nah)
Fuck all that articulate, my jawbone's illiterate
Money unlimited, cash, I'ma spend that shit (Woo, racks)

Killers at the hospital to finish the job (Uh)
Just the simple fact you still alive, it must your God (Lord)
Here's a lil' story 'bout this dude I knew named Todd (Huh)
Lil' trappin'-ass nigga that I met Mount Park (Gossip)
I saw the devil and didn't even have no pitchfork (Gossip)
If you scared, go to church and please don't jump off the porch (Gossip)
I ain't box in the MMA but it's a blood thirsty sport
In the street we hold court until we end up in court (Gossip, damn)
A crash dummy on the crash course, no chance to abort (Gossip)
Even when I didn't have money I couldn't afford to be scared (No)
I went to school with serial killers, if I lie, take my breath
I grew up with lil' Todd, he got hits on his belt (Gossip)
Well-known for murkin', sold the plug some hoes (Gossip)
Rolled the red carpet out when he hit the door (Gossip)
He a legend, known for pressin', think his presence a blessin'
Yes, he allegedly kidnapped a couple eses from Texas (Gossip)
Nigga reckless, been in the cell, ain't the one to be tested (Gossip)
My suggestion if you see him, better head for the exit
Yeah he'll eat a nigga breakfast then he'll come back for seconds
He get it how he live, how he live, he get it (Gossip)
Soft white devil, watch me turn it to hard (Gossip)
Guwoped up coke tore the family apart (Damn)
This not a blackboard, but it look like chalk (Preach)
Trap God, I make miracles with my grey fork (Gossip)
East Atlanta, Georgia this is not New York (EA)
Certain situations make the rabbi eat pork (What up)
Lil' Todd told a yapper, they say it's my fault (Gossip)
All I do is brag and floss what the dope man bought (Yeah)
Lil' Todd at your house with a gun to your spouse
Hogtied on the couch, duct tape, can't talk (Gossip)
Two weeks later heard he got his head blowed off
End of game, ruined another tryna play 8-ball
Fuck the messenger who told me, his gossipin' ass (Gossip)
I got garbage bag money, I throw my roof in the trash (Trash)
I got bipolar money, I got crazy cash (Gossip)
Had them delusions of grandeur about my crazy past, it's Wop (Gossip)

[Verse 1]
Fuck the feds, I'ma make my money take a leap
I'ma take a flight, bring it back for the cheap
'Cause nothin' shakin' here but the leaves in the trees
Got a bitch in a jungle smashin' leaves with her feet (Huh?)
Just to stay up, coca leaves in her teeth
Then she chew it like it's gone, gotta see it to believe (Why?)
What a wicked web we weave when we lyin' to deceive
And the apple don't ever fall far from the tree (Nah)
Fixin' up a ki with my rewrap machine (Fresh)
If you need me to cook it, I'ma whip up free
All the checkers know me, used to keep they ID
And the outside cold, but the boy got heat
Tractor trailer jumpin' out the freight like "Beep" (Beep)
This ain't a mixtape, all my bricks cost a fee (Skrrt)
I-20 Gucci Mane, bitch, get out the way
I go Luda with the 'bows, I could throw 'em from the Bay

[Interlude]
Ha
Guwop

[Verse 2]
It's cold outside, they wanna warm me (Haa)
I brought an army case a nigga wanna harm me (Bam)
For Christmas, mom got me the London Fog
So many felonies, I still can't go to London (Damn)
A quarter mil' and I went to Montreal
He just a nigga rappin', I'm a hustler
Gettin' cocky and my wrist gettin' rockier (Bling)
All the snow got 'em watchin' with binoculars (Wop)

[Verse 1]
There's a time that I remember, when I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever, and everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day

[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you
Memories bring back, memories bring back...
Memories bring back you
Memories bring back, memories bring back you
Memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Verse 2]
There's a time that I remember when I never felt so lost
When I felt all of the hatred was too powerful to stop
Now my heart feel like an ember and it's lighting up the dark
I'll carry these torches for ya that you know I'll never drop

[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you
Memories bring back you, memories bring back
Memories bring back you, memories bring back you
Memories bring back, memories bring back you
Memories bring back you, memories bring back
Memories bring back, memories bring back you
Memories bring back, memories bring back you
Memories bring back, memories bring back you

Woi-oi
Ayy

[Verse]
I don't cop things for resale, don't do iCloud, don't do email
Feds wanna tap up man and wire up man like Chubbs did Detail
Back when Ricky was doin' up Teesdale, I was doin' dinner with Teezy
I didn't trust no one, swore gyal lined me 'cause gyal too greazy
Niko never move neeky, sweatsuit Nike, sweatsuit DG
If man get beaky, ring ring, call up GiGi, do him up neatly
Used to look up to a man from certain ends with tune on repeat
Thought he was a bad boy, then 'til man got pinched and man went PC
Man went PC just like Dell and Windows, some man been those
Before I was ever around Kendall's, I was at ends though, dreamin' up Enzos
The woman I do end up with has to be a bad gyal just like Munchie
Can't have no pretentious ting when I know this road gets bumpy
Word to the broski Jay, he got different names in different countries
Three waps in the whip and we beat that case, where man live way too comfy
I don't do well with people makin' disses or makin' threats
Woi-oi, man got flown like private jets, for way, way less
I know you tried to get one down on us, ever since then it's been stress
'Cause you know the rest 'dem owe you one and we always pay them debts
Wassa, wassa, just like the crodie Pressa, I don't do no passa
Link with Skull and Cuz and Jamie ah yard and we deh pon Gaza
Pasha Sasha pissed, I was way too young at the time for slashings
You niggas spend too much time on captions, not enough time on action
Pick one man with slaps that's rappin', I bet he don't want no clashings
The LV pouch on chest is just for fashion, niggas just actin'
Are you dumb or stupid? The wheels on the Rolls is Chromazz, headshot domazz
Just checked in at a hotel, floor that we on got potent aromas
OVOXO link up, mandem drink up, me and the drillers
Hawk and Sticks and Cash and Baka, Gucci, P, and Gilla
And the boy that sound like he sang on Thriller, you know that's been my nigga
Yeah, we just had to fix things, family, 6ix tings, we can't split up
As for the rest of the game, I'll do man dirty, man'll get two time
To me, that's just our side, I don't really care who rides on whose side
Bring ten shots to the poolside, never seen none of these grown men outside
4301, won't spare no one, niggas gotta know about Southside
Steppin' outta line, get outlined, and you know I'm tied up stateside
Bringin' man down when they take sides, tryna get saved by the bell like Bayside
Prince, I carry that last name, that shit stays on me like brand names
Jas just lined up brand new hand tings and nice guy on a madting
Everyone I know has codenames, anyone I'm beefin' with is a no-name
Niggas can't even win home games, they just gotta fall in line like Soul Train

[Outro]
Ayy
Yeah

Mmm

[Verse 1]
Wake up and smell the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty?
When we talk, you say it softly
But I love it when you're awfully quiet, hmm
Quiet, mmm
You see the piece of paper
It could be a little greater
Show me what you could make her
You'll never know until you try it, mmm
And you don't have to keep it quiet, hmm

[Chorus]
And I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play

[Verse 2]
Look up, out of your window
See snow, won't let it in though
Leave home, and feel the wind blow
'Cause it's colder here inside in silence, mmm
And you don't have to keep it quiet, ah

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play

[Verse 1]
Take me to the rooftop
I wanna see the world when I stop breathing
Turnin' blue
Tell me love is endless, don't be so pretentious
Leave me like you do

[Pre-Chorus]
If you need me, you wanna see me
You better hurry 'cause I'm leavin' soon

[Chorus]
Sorry can't save me now
Sorry I don't know how
Sorry there's no way out
But down
Mmm, down

[Verse 2]
Taste me, the salty tears on my cheek
That's what a year-long headache does to you
I'm not okay, I feel so scattered
Don't say I'm all that matters
Leave me, déjà vu

[Pre-Chorus]
If you need me, wanna see me
You better hurry, 'cause I'm leavin' soon

[Chorus]
Sorry can't save me now
Sorry I don't know how
Sorry there's no way out
But down
Mmm, down

[Outro]
Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
But I'm not sorry
Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
Sorry

[Verse 1]
Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Pre-Drop]
May–, may–, may–, may–, may–, may–

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

If you offer me pheasant, I'd rather have grouse
If you put me in a house, I would much prefer a flat
If you put me in a flat, then I'd rather have a house
If you set me on a mouse, then I only want a rat

The Rum Tum Tugger is a terrible bore

[Jason Derulo]
When you let me in, then I want to go out
I'm always on the wrong side of every door
As soon as I get home, then I like to get about
I like to lie in the bureau drawer
But I make such a fuss if I can't get out, hoo

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Macavity's a mystery cat, he's called the Hiddenpaw
For he's the master criminal who can defy the law
He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair
For when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
He's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity
His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare
But when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin
You would know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunken in
His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed
His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed
He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake
And when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
For he's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity's not there

[Bridge: Taylor Swift]
He's outwardly respectable, I know, he cheats at cards
And his footprints are not found in any files of Scotland Yard's
And when the larder's looted and the jewel case is rifled
Or when the milk is missing or another peke's been stifled
Or the greenhouse glass is broken and the trellis past repair
There's the wonder of the thing, Macavity's not there

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Idris Elba & Both]
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity
He always has an alibi, and one or two to spare
What ever time the deed took place, Macavity wasn't there
And they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known
I might mention Mungojerrie, Rumpleteazer, Griddlebone
Are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time
Just controls the operations, the Napoleon of Crime
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
He's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity, Macavity
Macavity, Macavity

[Outro: Idris Elba, Taylor Swift]
When a crime's discovered, then
Macavity's not there

Verse One
Right outside this lazy summer home
You don't have time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nuthatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

Chorus
Wake up to find out
That you are the eyes of the World
But the heart has its beaches
Its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you
Are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons
Its evenings and songs of its own

Verse Two
There comes a redeemer
And he slowly too fades away
There follows a wagon behind him
That's loaded with clay
And the seeds that were silent
All burst into bloom and decay
The night comes so quiet
And it's close on the heels of the day
Chorus
Wake up to find out
That you are the eyes of the World
But the heart has its beaches
Its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you
Are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons
Its evenings and songs of its own

Verse Three
Sometimes we live no
Particular way but our own
Sometimes we visit your country
And live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses
Sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear
Are just songs of our own

Chorus
Wake up to find out
That you are the eyes of the world
But the heart has its beaches
Its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you
Are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons
Its evenings and songs of its own

All of my brothers, I feel like I'm home

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Wintertime, wintertime
Remember when you were a friend of mine?
Remember when we couldn't get in line?
Now we the reason why they in the line
Wintertime, wintertime, wintertime

In gray skies, I need new socks
'Cause I'm walkin' out with no shoes on
Wintertime, wintertime, wintertime
Contrary, platinum ring
One to ten, season feelings, no seasons
Wintertime, wintertime
The sky is fallin'
The sky is fallin’
That’s it

Wasn't looking for what I found
But I found you and I'm bound to
Find happiness in being around you

[Chorus]
I'm glad when I'm making love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel

Nah I'm just saying 'cause like MacBook Pro's are like $3000 if you wan't like a really good one, right?
And also I'm just talking to myself out loud right now
You pay $3000 for a MacBook Pro
And it breaks not even a year later
And you take it in and they say "this will cost $900 to fix" and you're like "okay, word" like and then what and they're like
"We have to take it to this like summer camp but it has to be sent over to, uh, Silicon Valley
It has to be sent over there
We have to do an evaluation on it"
And it scares me and you're just like "okay, wait, what?"

Swing me around, pull me into the flames

Bloodshot eyes, I think I'm on my way

Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn
Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you’re mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?

[Outro: Lana Del Rey]
I will love you till the end of time
I will love you till the end of time

[Verse 1]
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

[Verse 2]
I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I–)
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

[Bridge]
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I–)
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no (Oh no), I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

[Verse 1]
Darling, darling, darling
It's no need to worry
It’s just a couple things
(Just a couple things on my brain, you know?)
If it's you and other
It's no need to worry (You don’t have to worry)
'Cause I can sleep between you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a third wheeler
I'm a side better
I'm a home wrecker
Give it up
I'm a third wheeler
I'm a side better
I'm a home wrecker
Give it up, give it up, give it up

I’ll keep your, your best interest
I’ll keep your, your best interest
I'll keep your best interest
I’ll keep your best interest

I was, I was, I was, I was out here playing games
You was out here with a lame one
(I can play the side nigga role easy, but not for too long)
I'm the, I'm the, I'm the, I’m the side nigga
I gotta sneak around and hide with you
I wanna see you, give me five minutes
Paparazzi probably got like five pictures (Click-click-click-click)
(I won't tell anybody, it's our secret)
Top, top, top, top of the morning like yeehaw
I took my shot, this is B-ball, nigga
The team you play for is seesaw
So I know that it's fake when I see y'all
Don't wanna fuck what you got up
I would never blow your spot up
I know my place, I'm the landlord
I'll carry the weight 'til my hands sore
(We can't keep doing this)

[Chorus]
I'll keep your, your best interest (It's our secret)
I'll keep your best interest
(I can play the side nigga role easy, but not for too long)

That's all I wanna do
Ayy, yo

Bucket hat like I'm Gilligan
Hit Wallace, I just ordered a Cullinan
Milkin' the cow, what are you niggas uttering?
Churning the butter, sensitive niggas crying
Stepping in puddles in them new (Giannos, nigga, come on)
The team I'm assembling, you trembling
We in a circle huddling, fumble and we coming in
Tackling your empire, it's Robert crumbling
One nom'? Huh, shit is humbling
I'm a fucking jumbotron, juggernaut
You a G? No, you're not
New balloon, watch it p-
Concave on a skateboard
Don't do surfboards, I don't ride waves
Been around forever, Murray's Pomade, nigga
Been like a decade, yeah, haha, uh, ayy, yo

[Verse 2]
Keep it buck, I switch it up
You niggas don't, that's why you stuck
I needed seven figures, hit Australia, pick it up
Find some young twink and get my nipples sucked
Bad yellow bitch look like pimple pus
Bad chocolate bitch look like Lionel knuckles
Y'all got too much baggage and I pack light, Louis trunk
Luggage double C, emeralds double V
Uni tee, but the sweater vest is me
Lemonade, elderflower with the rose
Sony re'd up, I'ma split it with the bro, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Niggas like, "Act your age, T, you trippin'"
Pushin' thirty, but the skin say different, well
If I act my last deal, I'm probably twelve
I put some niggas on, nigga set a lob
Then they hurt theyself, niggas Cheddar Bob (Pew, pew, pew)
Foot is on the gas, I ain't letting off (Skrrt)
Every car is gas, pissing Greta off
And they Group B and the leather soft
And I knew the cow, and he better off dead

One take
It's like 7 a.m., haha
Hi old friend
How you been?
What’s that new glow in your eyes?
I can tell
You’re doing well
What’s that new look in your eyes
That took so long to realize?
That took so long to realize?
That took so long to realize?

Hi my dear
You’re finally here
The water’s rising up to my ears
Can I offer you a beer?
The kitchen’s rolling in the tide
I’ll dive down and get you one if you like
It took so long to realize
It took so long to realize
It took so long to realize
It took so long to realize
It took so long to realize

[Intro]
If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand?
'Cause I've been in love before
And I've found that love was more
Than just holding hands (I heard that)

[Verse 1]
If I give my heart to you
I must be sure from the very start
That you would love me more than her, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
If I trust in you, oh now, please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too, oh, please
Don't hurt my pride like her
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad
If our new love was in vain

[Verse 3]
So I hope you see, oh, that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

[Bridge]
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain

[Verse 4]
So I hope you'll see, that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you, yeah

[Outro]
No, no, no, oh, oh
I stay by the phone
It rings all night long
I can’t find you
How long will it last
To you’re stuck in my grasp
It hurts to say
That you’re gone

If you go without me
Without me
I don’t know
Where I’ll be
Where I’d be without you

Trouble comes and the trouble it goes
When it comes it’ll rattle your bones
I’m aware of the struggles but I’ve got no where to go
But you take just a little too much time
To make the decision if you’re mine
I can’t feel and I need you here
If you go without me
Without me
I don’t know
Where I’ll be
Where I’d be without you

Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you

[Jameela Jamil presents Swift with her award.]

Absolutely love this one, right? This is sort of a... it's not a short speech, so, just, I don't want this to slip and break, 'cause it's very important to me.

[Jamil takes the award from Swift to hold.]

Thank you so much. She's so supportive. We all need someone like that. I'm Taylor, good evening. I wanna first thank Billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor, for -

[Microphone stand lowers.]

Whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent, okay. I wanna say thank you so much to Billboard for giving me this honor, for naming me as their Woman of the Decade. So, what does it mean to be the Woman of this Decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. When this decade began, I was 20 years old, and I had put out my self-titled debut album when I was 16. And then the album that would become my breakthrough album, which was called Fearless, and I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations send my songs "Love Story" and "You Belong With Me" to number one for the first time.

And I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you. Whether you deserve to be there. Whether your male producer or co-writer is the reason for your success. Or whether it was a savvy record label; it wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry, and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror for my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn't do is exactly what I did.

[Audience claps.]

Huh, I'll take it, thanks! Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems, and the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like "Mean," "Shake It Off," and "Blank Space." Basically, if people had something to say about me, I usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics. When Fearless did win Album of the Year at the Grammys, and I did become the youngest solo artist to ever win the award, with that win, came criticism and backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before as a young, new artist. All of a sudden, people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was I a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden, they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past I had had co-writers in the room.

At that time, I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was "A Swift Backlash," which is clever, you gotta give it to them. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieves success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news, comes some sort of pushback, but I didn't know that then.

So then, I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album, Speak Now, and that I would tour constantly, work on my vocals every day, and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that, soon enough, people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right, and then the circle would keep going on and on, and rolling along, and I would keep accommodating, over-correcting, in an effort to appease my critics.
They're saying I'm dating too much in my twenties? Okay, I'll stop. I'll just be single... for years. Now they're saying my album Red is filled with too many break-up songs? Okay, I'll make one about moving to New York, and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. Oh, they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music? Alright, okay, here's an entire genre shift, and a pop album called 1989.

[Audience cheers.]

Oh, you heard it? Sick! Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay, I can stop doing that, too. Now I'm actually a calculated, manipulator rather than a smart businesswoman? Okay, I'll disappear from public view... for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you? Okay, here's an album called reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere.

In the last ten years, I have watched as women in this industry are criticized, and measured up to each other, and picked at for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or, have you ever heard someone say, about a male artist, "I really like his songs, but I don't know what it is, there's just something about him I don't like. No! That criticism is reserved for us. But, you know, I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this: who lets that scrutiny break them, and who just keeps making art. I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was ruthly criticized -

[Someone in the audience cheers.]

Yes! Yeah, thank you. We have similar tastes, I like it. She was ruthlessly criticized in her early career, and then slowly but surely, she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner in music. And this year, her incredible album is nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammys, because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us. That the only way forward, is forward motion. That we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us.

And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry, whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizzo, Rosalía, Tayla Parx, Hayley Kiyoko, King Princess, Camila Cabello, Halsey, Megan Thee Stallion, Princess Nokia, Nina Nesbitt, Sigrid, Normani, H.E.R., Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Dua Lipa, Ella Mai, Billie Eilish, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now.

Female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales, and critical acclaim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast, we have to work this hard, we have to prove that we deserve this, and we have to top our last achievements. Women in music, onstage, or behind the scenes, are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible-feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge, and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could've crushed us made us into diamonds instead. And what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios, behind the mixing board, in A&R meetings, because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room.

[Audience cheers.]

We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade, and that is the streaming world. In music, we're always walking hand-in-hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome, like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. I've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators, and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still don't think that record contracts or producers' agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade, we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Don't you?

[Audience claps.]

Lately, there's been a new shift that has affected me personally, and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident loud person, I feel the need to bring it up: And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in, and buying up our music, as if it is real estate. As if it's an app, or a shoe line. This just happened to me without my approval, consultation, or consent. After I was denied the chance to purchase my music outright, my entire catalogue was sold to Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings in a deal that I'm told was funded by the Soros family, 23 Capital and the Carlyle Group.

Yet, to this day, none of these investors have ever bothered to contact me or my team directly, to perform their due diligence on their investment, on their investment in me, to ask how I might feel about the new owner of my art. The music I wrote, the videos I created, photos of me, my handwriting, my album designs. And of course, Scooter never contacted me or my team to discuss it prior to the sale, or even when it was announced.
I'm fairly certain he knew how I would feel about it, though, and let me just say that the definition of the toxic male privilege in our industry is people saying, "But he's always been nice to me!" when I'm raising valid concerns about artists and their right to own their music. And of course he's nice to you. If you're in this room, you have something he needs. The fact is that private equity is what enabled this man to think, according to his own social media post, that he could "buy me," but I'm obviously not going willingly.

Yet, the most amazing thing was to discover that it would be the women in our industry who would have my back and show me the most vocal support at one of the most difficult times, and I will never, ever forget it. Like, ever.

[Audience laughs.]

But to conclude, I will say that in ten years, I've seen forward steps in our industry. In our awareness, our inclusion, our ability to start calling out unfairness and misconduct. I've seen the advent of social media, the way it can boost the breakthrough of emerging artists. And I've seen fans become more engaged and supportive than ever before. I've leaned on that support, and it has kept me in a place where, no matter what, I always wanted to keep making music for them.

I was up on a stage in New York City in 2014, accepting Billboard Woman of the Year, and I was talking about the future of streaming. How we needed to make sure that the female artists, writers, and producers of the next generation were protected and compensated fairly. This was before my record deal with Universal, last year, that would contractually guarantee that the artists on their roster be paid upon any sale of their Spotify shares, unrecupable. So, thank you for that.

[Audience cheers.]

This speech I'm referring to was on my 25th birthday. I'm about to turn thirty tonight, woo! But my exact quote during this speech was, "I really just feel like we need to continue to try to offer something to a younger generation of musicians. Because somewhere, right now, your future Woman of the Year is probably sitting in a piano lesson, or in a girls' choir. And today, right now, we need to take care of her." I've since learned that, at that exact moment, an 11-year old girl in California really was taking piano lessons, and really was in a girls' choir. And this year, she has been named Woman of the Year at the age of seventeen. Her name is Billie.

[Audience cheers.]

And those are the stories we need to think about every day as we do our jobs in this industry. The ones where people's dreams come true and they get to create music and play it for people. The ones where fans feel a connection to music that makes their day easier, makes their night more fun, makes their love feel more sacred, or their heartache feel less isolating. The ones where all of you in this room stand as an example for someone else in the next generation who loves the same thing that we love: music. And no matter what else enters the conversation, we will bring it back to music.

And as for me, lately I've been focusing less on doing what they say I can't do and more on doing whatever the hell I want. Thank you for a magnificent, happy, free, confused, sometimes lonely, but mostly golden decade. I'm honored to be here tonight, I feel very lucky to be with you, thank you so much.
I don't feel as if I know you
You take up all my time
The days are long and the night will throw you away
Coz the sun don't shine
Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play

We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
Cos the years are following by like the rain
And it's never gonna be the same
'Til the life I knew comes to my house and says
Hello

There ain't no sense in feeling lonely
They got no faith in you
But I've got a feeling you still owe me
So wipe the shit from your shoes
Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play
We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
Cos the years are following by like the rain
And it's never gonna be the same
'Til the life I knew comes to my house and says
Hello

Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
It's good to be back
Cause nobody can do it like Mix Master can

[Ad-Rock]

He'll tweak your ass across the cross fade

And we be getting down with no delay
Mix Master Mike, what'cha got to say?
("Bug out!" "To!" "The mic" "All the time!")

Fresh like a box of the Krispy Kreme
Kenny Rogers' "Gambler" is my gambling theme
Mix Master Mike who's with the scratch routine

[MCA]
Always up in in it and in the know (know)
You know we break it down going toe to toe
The bass is booming from down below
Ed Norton is chillin' with Mario

[Adrock]
And well, my name is Adrock, I'm a Scorpio (scorpio)
Don't ask me cause I just don't know
I'm known to mop, I'm known to glow (glow)
But don't get mad when we got to go

[Chorus]
We're just three MCs and one DJ
And we be getting down with no delay
Mix Master Mike, what'cha got to say?
("Gotta, gotta," "Gotta get down!")

Mix Master, cut faster
Mix Master, cut-cut, cut faster!

[MCA]
This is all top secret and classified
I grab a hold of the mic and let the words glide
It's all hypnotic and sanctified
I never wanna let a bad day slip by

We causing all kinds of hysteria ('steria)
My beats is sick like malaria
But don't worry, I'll take care of ya

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Try to bite my tongue, but I can't take it
I got whiplash from me turnin' my head
Have somewhere else to go, no, I can't make it
I'd rather take my chance with you instead
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
You really got me open (Do you?)
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
High heels on, heard you comin' 'fore I seent ya
Movies all around, but you look like the feature
Had another meeting, now my plan is to meet you
Got my hands out, all I wanna do is reach ya
All I wanna do is greet ya
Infatuated, sorry if I stare
Where you posted up? I wanna be there
Way you curved up, it just ain't fair
No, it ain't

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Try to bite my tongue, but I can't take it
I got whiplash from me turnin' my head
Have somewhere else to go, no, I can't make it
I'd rather take my chance with you instead
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
You really got me open (Do you?)
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)

[Post-Chorus: Justin Bieber & Travis Scott]
Got me feeling giddy (Ah), like, "La, la, la, la" (Yeah)
Struck a match, you got me litty, like, "La, la, la, la" (It's lit)
You got the keys to my city (Ooh), like, "La, la, la, la" (Straight up)
Do you second that emotion, baby? (Ah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Mmm, yeah
Out to big boys (It's lit)
Spring her off the hitch (Yeah), everything legit
Movin' like the blitz (Blitz), crib like the Ritz (Like the Ritz)
So you know there's room (Skrrt)
So, baby, please
(Hold up, nah, nah, nah, that was the first time she did that)
Don't like to talk to bitch (Yeah), just like to play the wish
I know the problem is they bothered by the kid (I'm tryna pop another one in)
Oh, you sent the jet out for me?
You tryna ball harder than me?

[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]
Did I come 'cross your radar?
Cross your mind now and later?
Do you feel like you know me?
It's just a part of nature
Let's ask each other questions
Can we do each other favors?
Would you mind the labor? Baby

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Try to bite my tongue, but I can't take it (Ooh-wee)
I got whiplash from me turnin' my head (Hey, hey, hey)
Have somewhere else to go, no, I can't make it (Ooh-wee)
I'd rather take my chance with you instead
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
You really got me open (Do you?)

Struck a match, you got me litty, like, "La, la, la, la"
You got the keys to my city, like, "La, la, la, la"
Do you second that emotion, baby?

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Yeah, do you see us in Vegas pushin' a Monte Carlo?
Bet that money on baby, bet she don't leave me, oh, no
See them heat waves in the desert, look like a lake in the sand
Would you watch the sun burn out with me forever, ever, ever, ever?
You still intimidate me, keep me up on my toes now
Better man, what you made me
Made me aware of what I was missin'
Been missin' the way you give me envision, babe
Never thought I'd settle down, reckon I lied to myself
I was busy focusin' on bein' by myself
Set my feelings to the side, they all got dusty on a shelf
You wiped them down when I had nothin' left

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
When you asked me if I cheated, I said never (No way)
What are you willing to do to stay together? ('Gether)
How many times we gonna break up for the summer?
How many times you gonna try to call my mother? (Brrr-brrr)
Girl, you're killin' me, I don't wanna act like I can fix this (Fix it, fix it)
I don't wanna be the one that's changed since Texas
Currency, it comes so naturally, but I can't buy your love

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Post Malone & Justin Bieber]
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

[Verse 3: Clever]
I promise I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
Wake up, your face in my chest, your favorite hiding place
The roof is gone as we're driving out the private gate
Countin' the stars with our last name on the license plate
Woah, oh, oh, oh
I lied to myself 'bout trying to be here all alone
When I leave, it's bye for now, it's just never bye for long
Set my feelings aside, let's settle down
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

[Outro: Clever]
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around

[Chorus]
When you come around me
Treat me like you miss me
Even though you been with me
When you come around me
Do me like you miss me
Even though you been with me

[Verse 1]
Diggin' the way you feel on my skin
Got influence on me, can't comprehend
Oh no, next thing, you're on top of me
Okay with this, I call that a win-win

[Chorus]
So when you come around me
Treat me like you miss me
Even though you been with me
When you come around me
Do me like you miss me
Even though you been with me

[Post-Chorus]
Let's not miss out on each other
Let's get it in expeditiously
All that I want for you is perfection
Pull me down aggressively

[Verse 2]
Who taught you how to drive stick?
You a fool with it, love the way you fool with it
And the way you motion, motion in my lap
Love the way you move with it

[Chorus]
So when you come around me
Treat me like you miss me
Even though you been with me
When you come around me
Do me like you miss me
Even though you been with me

[Post-Chorus]
Let's not miss out on each other
Let's get it in expeditiously
All that I want for you is perfection
Pull me down aggressively

[Bridge]
When I rise up, baby, don't shy up
Open your mind, don't knock it 'til you try it, darlin'
Show off when you come closer
Don't waste no time, love it when I'm in it, shawty

[Chorus]
When you come around me
Treat me like you miss me
Even though you been with me
So when you come around me
Do me like you miss me
Even though you been with me
When you come around me
Treat me like you miss me
Even though you been with me
So when you come around me
Do me like you miss me
Even though you been with me

[Outro]
So when you come around me
Do me like you miss me

[Verse]
Let 'em speak, I know I'm meek but the mills louder
Watch the throne, kings kill when the prince feels power
It's the real deal, Holyfield, holy shit, holy grail
Silver spoon coon, young buffoon, yeah, they know me well
I'm makin' moves, couldn't lose, doin' Parker Lewis
Hot on my own, self-immolate, I could be a Buddhist
Hot on my own, check your tone, check your stance homie
You don't even like me, you just trynna get my fans homie
So nerdy but the flow wordy
Brain-freezin' with the flow slurpie
Ice cold but you know I burn cash like I had herpes
Not true, but I'm that dirty
Niggas quit bein' hot man, cold turkey
While I'm out in Kauai, man, soul searchin'
And these niggas be afraid and I'm so certain
Cause they don't know what to do when the world's broken
A lot of people try and go and talk shit but your girl stops me on the street
Like it's stop and frisk and a bunch of DDots wanna talk a lot of shit
But that's cool cause in the real world they really don't exist
It's all because the internet
Chance made millions, Haim made millions
Dan made millions, Kendrick made millions
I would too if I wasn't in my feelings
You know, cause like, people they say money's not everything
But money, you need money to do what you wanna do
Like money is power, honesty is power, truth is power
But at the same time they tell you like
Ain't nothin' more important than the mula
You ain't really eatin' boy, you gotta get your food up
We so steady eatin' baby, you already know that
The way I'm droppin' new shit, I'm sittin' on the toilet
Every night I tour that, moment
But we don't take pictures, when you're rich you just see it again
The only thing they really worry about is me and the pen
Wrote some shit on Instagram, I'm just bein' honest
They tried to give your boy pills like I'm bein' violent
They tried to give your boy pills just to keep him silent
Keep tellin' people the truth, you could be iconic
They tried to give your boy pills, like "he's scarin' us"
Try to stay inside, I don't really like appearances
I try to stay inside, but they still got something to say
"Are you still on the show? Are you dating Jhené?"
It's deeper than that
Calico inside the handbag, I'm keepin' the cat
I got some niggas in reserve like I'm deep in Iraq
And I'm deepening rap, and it's deeper than rap
This is deeper than rap

[Intro]
Mr. Rogers

[Chorus: Z-Ro]
Why you wanna see me now?
Is it because I'm on TV now? Yeah
My haters wish they could be me now
Thank the Lord the tables turned
'Cause now it's my turn

[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
When I used to be dirt broke, I couldn't afford to get a Happy Meal (Yeah)
Now it's steak and lobster, that's a make-a-player-happy meal (Yeah)
But back then, you were lookin' at me and laughin' tears (Hahaha)
Now I'm rich and you steady tryna get yo' ass up in here (Woo)
Tell me why I couldn't get a ride when I needed one
Now it's so many cars, it's like I never needed one
Allergic to bitch niggas, never see me with one
Want deeper life until Jesus Christ and his kingdom come
The same musty ass egghead sixth grader
Y'all were laughin', but he knew later, shit would get greater (Yeah)
From broke as a joke, now he's earnin' as much as six Lakers (Fire)
Save yourself, bitch, I'm savin' this paper (Haha)
I turned that green and trappin' into that black Bentley ballin' money
Always got at least fifteen stacks with me
And you can ride as long as you ain't got your hand out
Soon as you ask for somethin', that's when you get yo' ass out

[Chorus: Z-Ro]
Why you wanna see me now?
Is it because I'm on TV now? Yeah
My haters wish they could be me now
Thank the Lord the tables turned
'Cause now it's my turn

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, okay
Black car service
Had to kill myself to be here, was it all worth it?
Spent a lot of lonely nights contemplating purpose
Only did it 'cause I'm white, do I still deserve it?
Hell yeah
I put a lot of work in, thank the Lord he blessed me
First time in Houston, Bun took me to Frenchy's
I'll put a couple albums out, then they'll all forget me
But a gangster gon' always be a gangster, boy
And you don't know my past, you weren't right there wit' me
Hittin' licks to get some cash, just to buy some hash
I'm a rottweiler, top dollar, Babe Ruth, shot caller
Grand slam, head of the table, I'm the Godfather
Burn it to the ground, pickin' up the pieces
You can't save yourself when the beast is off the leashes
'Cause we comin' for you
Yeah, we comin' for you

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Why you wanna see me now?
Is it because I'm on TV now? Yeah
My haters wish they could be me now
Thank the Lord the tables turned
'Cause now it's my turn

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, yeah
If you don’t train, you never know what’s next to come
If you can’t see the top, then you can’t be number one, number one
Go spread your wings just like an eagle and fly
Oh don’t you look back after you conquer the sky

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Poo Bear]
Never wanna run away, never let your work be in vain
When you see the finish line is in your face
Have no pain, no pain
When love is all you have to give
You gotta let it persevere through the pain, any pain
Let your light shine through
Don’t let none get in your way
No pain (no pain), no pain (oh, no pain)
Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah
No pain, fearless, oh no pain
Oh woah, oh woah, no pain

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
When I was young I used to sing out on the block
No one came in your space, I had to make my own spot, aye
Staying determined, wasn’t easy at times
Never stopping your focus, till all fell in line

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Poo Bear]
Never did I run away, never let my work be in vain
When the finish line was in my face
Have no pain, no pain
When love is all you have to give
You gotta let it persevere through the pain, any pain
Let your light shine through
Don’t let none get in your way
No pain (no pain), no pain (oh no pain)
Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah
No pain, fearless, oh no pain
Oh woah, oh woah, no pain

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Pull up they know it's me
Smokin' organically

[?]
Look like your majesty
Car fast as can be
Roll one pass it to me
Pipe down nigga let's get faded
Droppin' ass on the seat
You need cash to compete
Pretty face in the mirror
Pretty ass on the seat
NIggas say they want smoke
They come askin' for me
Plus they see me with Berner, they know the class of my weed (That's for real they be like "aww you got Berner my nigga?")
Say you wanna get high, get too high and pass on the weed
Owners say we can smoke but too much they'll ask us to leave
Must not know it was that pack (Must not know it was that pack)
Must not know we spend them racks (Must not know we spend them racks)
Must not know we gettin' it back (Must not know we gettin' it back)
Number OG in my sack (Number OG in my sack)
Roller coastin', always floatin', capillaries open

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm smellin' like the pack
I'm smellin' like the pack
I'm smellin' like the pack
I'm smellin' like the pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack

[Verse 2: Tuki Carter]
I get up early then I roll
Grind and roll, grind and roll
Burn it down like thunder hoe
Smellin' like a nigga grow
Any state I'm blowin' smoke
On the bus and in the shows
With yo bitch and with my hoes
Blow my ganja through they nose
G shit, cool shit, peace shit I am on
Take a bitch, make a bitch get my weed and I'm gone
Niggas burnin' down my phone
I ain't the weed man
Smoke a ounce in one night
We smoke weed man

[?] my name
Take a bitch smoke out
No shame
Take a friend to smoke out
I ain't playin'
I ain't playin'
I ain't playin'
Smellin' like a pound of herb
Bitches gettin' on my nerves
Rollin' up some more of this herb
In the airport and smacked
Smellin' like that pack
In the front end, not the back
First class bitch

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm smellin' like the pack
I'm smellin' like the pack
I'm smellin' like the pack
I'm smellin' like the pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack

[Intro]
Yeah
Somebody, um
Somebody hit me today and they were like
"Nah, just make sure, you know
You tell me what to do when I get there, you know?"
(June, you're a genius)
I said, "I respect it, no problem"
I got all these blessings just to give it to others anyway
Know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, my hand's always open, for real

[Verse]
Ayy
Thirty-three years, I gave that to the game
Thirty-three mil', I'll save that for the rain
Five hundred weeks, I'll fill the charts with my pain
Five hundred mil' and I'll fall back in the 6ix
Finally give you niggas the space you need to exist
Michael Jackson shit, but the palace is not for kids
Still women sayin' it's childish, the way we live
Brought a few Ws to the 6ix
Baby mama fluke, but I love her for who she is
Baby, Wayne and Tez responsible for this shit
Half the time, I question my consciousness in this shit
Other times, I question if compliments are legit
Full-time, I'm out here confident as a bitch
Tryna make good on the promises that I give
Tryna make sure my accomplices are legit
Register the business in my brother's name
Thirty-five hunnid in her pocket, that should cover things
Certified lover man, trappin' out the motherland
Always move right so my watch is on the other hand
She can try and play it down now, but she was a fan
People wanna know what's in my pockets, they don't understand
My assistant always findin' Percocet and rubber bands
Know my mom might not want to hear how I discover plans
Word to Sandra Graham, no one love you like your mother can
I watched Michael Rubin win a million off a couple hands
I decide what to see next like it's on demand
I decide what to be next like I'm switchin' plans
I'ma tell you what you feel next like the weatherman
I will split heads and break necks for my little man
6 God, prayin' hands like I'm a religious man
But I'm just a sicker man, wicked man
Look, we can argue back and forth, but who's the richer man?
Isn't that what matters in this world that we livin' in?
Bang those dividends, snakes stay slitherin'
How you plan to make it to the top by just fittin' in?
How you plan to take a nigga's spot by just givin' in?
How you gon' treat this shit like you gon' get to live again?
How you gettin' hype off one hit? Do that shit again
How you got a manager you mad at after you got the win?
Bet you got some niggas that'll love you 'til the bitter end
Bet you got somebody that's just smarter than your other friends
Give 'em a percentage, see what happens to your blessings then
You just need to stay close to your people that was there when others could've been
There when others should've been
Got a nigga starin' at the game like, "Damn, coach, put him in"
But you never listen, so you niggas goin' wood again
Got us in the crib, talkin' 'bout what niggas coulda been, shoulda been
And I got your girl on the second floor, beggin' me to put it in
And it's not because all of the money that you wouldn't spend
And it's not because I set it up to try and get revenge
It's because you niggas insecure, you ain't made men
It's because even though you hate on me, we stay friends
It's because you niggas never learn when to say when
Yeah

[Outro]
For real
Facts, you know what I'm sayin'?
Hahaha, yeah

[Verse 1]
Just the other day, shit was all cool
Now I can't catch a break, thinking 'bout you
I promised that I wouldn't, but I ran back to you
'Cause one more night alone, just might not be good for
What got into you? Why you acting brand new for?
And what I ever do? Maybe I just took it too far
I did fall apart, maybe I was a little too much
And now I'm thinking too much, drank a little too much

[Chorus]
But I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you
And I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you
'Cause it's all a little too much, and I'm in need of your love
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you

[Verse 2]
You used to say it was forever, I remember
Tryna' forget, I can't forget ya
Still got your makeup on my sweater
And I know that it's all over
But memories live forever
For the worse or for the better
Can't let you go, my heart won't let her
Can't let you go and you know it
Yeah, I put my all in
I gave you whatever
Gave you my heart and you broke it, yeah
You were so selfish, did nothing to help me
And I was so blinded, but I couldn't help it

[Chorus]
But I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you
And I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you
'Cause it's all a little too much, and I'm in need of your love
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you
But I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you
And I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you
'Cause it's all a little too much, and I'm in need of your love
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you

I hate you for what you did
And I miss you like a little kid
I faked it every time but that's alright
I can hardly feel anything
Hardly feel anything at all

[Verse 2]
You gave me fifteen hundred
To see your hypnotherapist
I only went one time, you let it slide
Fell on hard times a year ago
Was hoping you would let it go
And you did

[Chorus]
I have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you out

[Verse 3]
I'm on the outside looking through
You're throwing rocks around your room
And while you're bleeding on your back in the glass
I'll be glad that I made it out
And sorry that it all went down like it did

[Chorus]
I have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you out

Why do you sing with an English accent?
I guess it's too late to change it now
You know I'm never gonna let you have it
But I will try to drown you out

[Bridge]
You said when you met me you were bored
You said when you met me you were bored
And you, you were in a band when I was born

[Chorus]
I have emotional motion sickness
I try to stay clean and live without
And I want to know what would happen
If I surrender to the sound
Surrender to the sound

And even though my whole might break
And this body's no more

I was living high and low
Got my choice and I got my soul
Blame it on me
I was doing the underdog
I got my choice and I gotta go home

I got my time and I got my past
Blame it on me
I was living in the right
I got my time without a sound
Blame it on me

Now I must find
There’s no love in my life

Pretty kitty cat west
Snow white tight year
Make you wanna pull up on that tail like a kite steer

That pussy weak, that pussy Bambi
Smoke a little weed, bitch I'm feeling Dandy
Lying in the jungle, screaming like a Banshee (Aah!) (Uh, uh, uh)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, my eyes find China
I cry to the fine diners
Got the munchies, nigga I'm higher than flight milage
A ounce of the OG, a bump at a white square
That jumps at the nose, freezes
And melts your septum entirely
I been highly admiring my bills with tolerancy
And all of them fry the kin in the club
Like they knocking 8-balls in pits in your boss's pockets
Clit, gun, cock it, you get one shot, if you can twist my knowledge
B-B-B-Brain cloud under my bone
I'm wondering what could make
My troubles just go away
I'm bumpin' in for the pain, I'm bumpin' in for the day
And if I do it tomorrow, I'm prolly goin' insane like: ¡woo, woo! (Uh, uh, uh)

[Chorus]
I want it all, give me some more, give me some more, give me, give me, some more
I want it all, give me some more, give me some more, give me, give me, some more

I want it all, give me some more, give me some more, give me, give me, some more

See I put you on, now your option's not slim, huh

[Chorus]
Baby, you are
The death of me, you know

Better believe it
Oh-oh, whenever you're not in my presence
It feels like I'm missing my blessings, yeah
So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night
'Til you're back again, oh yeah, yeah
You think I'm biased, to my significant other
You hit it right on the head, only been missing my lover
Got a whole lot of texts in my phone and I don't reply
But the next eight bars tell you why

Ain't worried about nobody else
If I ain't with you, I ain't myself

From the bottom of my heart, please believe

The road is long with a many a winding turn
That leads us to who knows where
Who knows where
But I'm strong
Strong enough to carry him

He ain't heavy
He's my brother

So one we go
His welfare is my concern

No burden is he to bear
We'll get there
For I know he would not encumber me

He ain't heavy
He's my brother
If I'm laden at all I'm just laden with sadness

That's everyone's heart isn't filled with the gladness
Of love for one another
It's a long
Long road from which there is no return

While we're on the way to there
Why not share?
Yes
And the load
The load does not weigh me down
Down at all

He ain't heavy, I l love him
He's my brother

He ain't heavy
He's my brother, let me say it again

He ain't heavy
He ain't heavy
He's my brother

I'm open, you're closed
Where I follow, you'll go
I worry I won't see your face
Light up again

You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always tryin'
To keep my baby cryin'
Treacherous, cunnin', declinin'
You got my baby cryin' (Hee)

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
Still they hate you (Still they hate you)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
You're just a buffet (You're just a buffet) (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
They eat off of you (They eat off of you) (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable, aaow!

[Verse 3]
Billie Jean is always talkin' when nobody else is talkin'
Tellin' lies and rubbin' shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', spyin'
Sayin' you just want to be startin' somethin'

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)

It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
Still they hate you (Still they hate you)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
You're just a buffet (You're just a buffet) (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
They eat off of you (They eat off of you) (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable, aaow!

[Instrumental Interlude]
Aaow!

[Verse 4]
If you can't feed your baby (Yeah, yeah)
Then don't have a baby (Yeah, yeah)
And don't think maybe (Yeah, yeah)
If you can't feed your baby (Yeah, yeah)
You'll be always tryin'
To stop that child from cryin'
Hustlin', stealin', lyin'
Now baby's slowly dyin'

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
Lift your head up high and scream out to the world
"I know I am someone," and let the truth unfurl (Hee-ha)
No one can hurt you now because you know what's true
Yes, I believe in me, so do believe in you

[Verse 1]
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

[Pre-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?

Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?

[Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

[Post-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?

So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?

[Refrain]
You've been hit by—
You've been hit by—
A Smooth Criminal
Aaow!

[Verse 2]
So they came in to the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidation

[Pre-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay? (Annie, are you okay?)
So, Annie, are you okay? (Annie, are you okay?)

You were struck down
It was your doom

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?

He came into your apartment (I don't know)
Left bloodstains on the carpet (I don't know why, baby)
And then you ran into the bedroom (Help me)
You were struck down
It was your doom Annie (Dag gone it)
Annie are you okay? (Dag gone it-baby)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (Dag gone it-baby)
There's a sound at the window (Dag gone it-baby)
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie (Hoo! Hoo!)

[Verse 1]
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
Hee!

[Chorus]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Ooh!

[Verse 2]
They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
And I told 'em about equality
And it's true, either you're wrong or you're right
Hoo!

[Chorus]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Hoo!
Gone withca girl!
Hee-hee!

[Bridge]
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

[Interlude]
Shamone, shamone
Shamone, shamone
It don't matter, it-it-it-it-it don't matter
Shamone
It don't matter

[Rap: L.T.B.]
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

[Verse 3]
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
Hee-hee!

[Chorus]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

[Outro]
Alright, alright
Ah, dah, ah (Ooh, ooh)
Dah, ah, dah, alright
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah now
Alright, alright (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Shamone, don't
Yeah, yeah, yeah now
Alright (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white, hoo! (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white, hoo! (Shamone, dah, ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It don't matter

[Chorus]
I found myself in this bar
Makin' mistakes and makin’ new friends
I was growin' up and nothing made sense
Buzzin' all night like neon in the dark
I found myself in this

[Verse 1]
Couldn’t wait to turn 21
The day I did, I got too drunk
Spin around dizzy on the patio
Found out real quick how to take it slow
Got whiskey bent on whiskey sours
Ran my mouth to an out-of-towner
Learned a big lesson when I met the bouncer

[Chorus]
I found myself in this bar
Makin' mistakes and makin' new friends
I was growin' up and nothing made sense
Buzzin' all night like neon in the dark
I found myself in this bar

[Post Chorus]
Ooh-woah-ooh
Ooh-woah-ooh
Ooh-woah-ooh
I found myself in this bar

[Verse 2]
Saw her in the corner sippin' something tall
Cracked a few jokes, we hit off
Get down the road I'm watching her
Walk through the door with some new jerk
And we had it good, and it hurts so bad
But I had to stand my ground
Chased my pride with another round

[Chorus]
I found myself in this bar
Makin' mistakes and makin’ new friends
I was growin’ up and nothin' made sense
Learnin’ how to live with a broken heart
I found myself in this bar

[Post Chorus]
Ooh-woah-ooh
Ooh-woah-ooh
Ooh-woah-ooh

[Bridge]
Those nights, what I would give for one more
Bud Light, still kissin' on the front porch
Didn't even know what I was lookin' for

[Outro]
But I found myself in this bar
I found myself in this bar
I found myself in this bar
Ain’t it a stranger thing you keep tucked in your heart
I found myself in this bar

[Verse 1]
When we were livin' in squalor, wasn't it Heaven?
Back when we used to get on it four out of seven
Now even though that was a time I hated from day one
Eventually, terrible memories turn into great ones

[Pre-Chorus]
So if they call you, embrace them
If they hold you, erase them

[Chorus]
'Cause it might've been somethin', who's to say?
Does it help to get lost in yesterday?
And you might've missed somethin', don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
And you're gonna have to let it go someday
You've been diggin' it up like Groundhog Day
'Cause it might've been somethin', don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday

[Verse 2]
Matty said life didn't go the way that he planned it
Said, "Oh, what I'd give to start over, boy, I demand it
So, what was I ever afraid of? Why did I worry?
And why was I ever so brainless? Head in a flurry"

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause if they call you, embrace them
If they stall you, erase them

[Chorus]
'Cause it might've been somethin', who's to say?
Does it help to get lost in yesterday?
And you might've missed somethin', don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
And you're gonna have to let it go someday
You've been diggin' it up like Groundhog Day
'Cause it might've been somethin', don't say
'Cause it has to get lost in yesterday

[Refrain]
If it calls you, embrace it
If it haunts you, face it

[Bridge]
I know it's mad, I understand
It's only Snakes and Ladders
The period you never had
There's only one that matters

[Outro]
And if it calls you, embrace it
If it holds you, erase it
Replace it

[Intro]
Man, I don't even know why I keep doin’ this shit to myself
Shit crazy
Stressful as a motherfucker
I wear my heart on my sleeve, nigga
Glass house
Fuck you talkin' 'bout?

[Verse 1]

Already forgot ya like I never knew ya
Watch me pull up in that Phantom while I’m livin' in Miami (Hey!)

Tired, playin' same shit for ya
Done flexin' on you
Oh-woah, oh-oh
Tired, playin' same shit for ya
Done flexin' on you
Haha, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Two of my niggas said they had they way with you, way with you
You know that I don't want it if another nigga on it now
I ain't got no time to play no game with you (No)
Flooded out the Rollie just to drip it on you, drip it on you (Ow!)
Want me to be stressin', but, girl, you know I'm not
Now you all in my Tumblr tryna see what I'm on
I thought I told you that my fall back game too strong
Talkin' all the shit I would have, but the moment's gone

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I'm done and my heart is made of stone, oh

[Chorus]
Oh, look what you done (You done)
You gon' make me pull up on you with the next bitch right now (Yeah)
Ain't no tellin' what I might do from now (Oh-woah)
Oh, and now we're over and done (Done)

Goin' to another nigga, show up and he pull you out the club
Go 'head with the ho-ass tendencies (Oh)
You wanna fuck that nigga, go 'head and fuck him 'cause I won't hold you down
He gon' let you go in a minute
And all these niggas wanna fuck my bitches because I'm winnin' (Oh)
Nigga, let me know when you finished
'Cause you ain't gettin' over, no, no
That's what I call pimpin'

[Chorus]
Oh, look what you done

If you didn't know I'm that nigga, bet you know now
If you didn't know I'm that nigga, bet you know now
If you didn't know, bet you know now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
This is not your average rodeo (Ayy)
Baby, if you tryna ride with me
A chin reaction like dominoes (Ayy)
And all my ladies scream for me
And make it loud
Make it loud
A little louder
A little louder (Ooh-ooh)
(Ha! JB, leggo)
Ooh, make it loud

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I be Mr. Who You Wanna Be
Don't hate me 'cause I'm doin' me, you won't wanna be
Anywhere I go, girl, you should follow me
And I don't mean Twitter, just come follow and me
Bottles of that Kool-Aid, drink some
Already know I'm your favorite flavor, but pick one
Already got them girls screaming, "Where he came from?"
Get it up while I'm feeling like an alien

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
Wake up in the morning and I'm looking for my clothes
Couldn't tell the time 'cause my wrist stay froze
Stayed at my girl crib, snuck out the back door
Speedin' to the show, I'm cuttin' it close
Your boy's still young but you know that I'm a pro
I'm thankful for my fans, so I'm rockin' every show
Show, I'm in Mexico
I got 'em going crazy, ooh-ooh, loco

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
This is not your average rodeo (Ayy)
Baby, if you tryna ride with me
A chin reaction like dominoes (Ayy)
And all my ladies scream for me
And make it loud
Make it loud
A little louder
A little louder (Ooh-ooh)
Ooh, make it loud

[Verse 2: Chris Brown, with Kevin McCall]
I'm doin' a hunnid, I'm tryna peel out
I'm wilin' out, I need to slow down
Down the reg', all I see is you, oh
Come here, girl, I won't hurt you
Just throw my heart, I wanna search you
Can I pat you down?
Girl, your body's sayin'

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
Wake up in the morning and I'm looking for my clothes (Yeah)
Couldn't tell the time 'cause my wrist stay froze (Oh)
Stayed at my girl crib, snuck out the back door (Door)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
I got 'em goin' crazy, hand on my antenna
Goin' apeshit, someone throw me a bannana
Pose
Now watch me pose for the cameras
Click, click, click, watch 'em all go Adam Sandler
These girls go too loco, they won't let me on they campus
I guess they parents feel like I don't meet they standards
I felt too many co-ed parties, we in our pajamas
Vegas pool party, hunnid girls in my cabana
Hunnid on my neck, your house on my pinkie
All I see is green, dollar signs when I'm blinkin'
More bucks on the tour bus
Me and Bieber hit the Dougie, they cheer for us

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
This is not your average rodeo (Ayy)
Baby, if you tryna ride with me
A chin reaction like dominoes (Ayy)
And all my ladies scream for me
And make it loud

Yeah, yeah
These motherfuckers don't know
These motherfuckers don't know, yeah

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
The tracklist filled up with so many mistakes, can't believe I'm alive
Will you be a saint or a sinner? Whatever you want, you decide
All day I been faded, all day I been faded, but fuck it, I drive
Now I'm in a Mercedes, the pills made me crazy, today I could die
Fall asleep in the pussy, wake up to the money, my life a cliché
I think I deserve a promotion, I think I'ma need me a raise
Tell these motherfuckers, "Keep playin'"
'Cause me, I created the game though
Stack my money and lay low, they can't fuck with my bankroll

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
I been a real one, yeah, I been a real one

[Open Verse]

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah (Okay, okay, okay, okay), yeah

Then back to the grind (Woo)
They party and bullshit, get wasted, I done it
Ain't wastin' my time (No, no)
I'm faded, my eyes low, so no reason to hide that I'm blatantly high
Bitches been trippin' since in the beginnin'
Don't listen every time they tellin' me lies, oh no (Oh, no)
All I ever wanted was to be somebody special
Couple diamonds dancin' on the dental
Cap in mind, don't mind though by the elbow, yeah, you know
Know you poppin' when you make a million dollars on the cellphone (Huh?)
Money been a manifesto, said, the money been a manifesto, yeah
I'm up like espresso, the bitches say, "Hello"
I'm outta the friendzone (Woo)
I rode with the homies, where ever we go
We don't follow no dress code (Nah)
And I'm still young, gettin' faded to feel numb

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah (Woo)
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
I been a real one, yeah, I been a real one, yeah

[Verse 3: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah, you know that I am a real one (A real one)
Yeah, count my money to a million (Yeah)
Count my money to a billion (Yeah)
My new crib look like a building (Yeah)
Nowadays don't got no feelings (Ayy)
Fucked that bitch right in my whip, yeah
But my new whip got no ceiling (No ceiling)
Hit that bitch straight from the back, yeah
Aim at her face when I finish (Huh?)
That lil' nigga pray I lose, yeah
Know that he mad that I made it, yeah, wait up
I was patient
I was patient, money right now

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah

[Verse 1]
All up in my head
You always tell me that it's all up in my head
You got me overlookin' all of my options
You got me going back and forth with my conscience, my conscience
All up in my bed
You always seem to end up all up in my bed
I tell you you not gonna get what you want, but
You always seem to get it just how you want it, want it
So I'ma be real, I cannot be fake
I never thought that it'd be this way
Yeah, I never thought that you would've changed
Yeah, I would have thought that you would've stayed

[Chorus]
So tell me right now, what's it gon' be?
I don't need love, got a hunnid' on me
Don't want it any other way
Want it any other way
So tell me right now, what's it gon' be?
I don't need love, got a hunnid' on me
Don't want it any other way
Want it any other way

[Verse 2]
It's lights down, I've been in my bag
Pour some of some red, got a couple selling bread, yeah
Couple down my head, she dyin' over here
She bomb another year, I'll take it, I won't ride it, yeah
She talkin' about the mindset, said "I wanted it today"
I don't really wanna talk, I got nothing, nun' to say
I got ones that buss it down on me, and I been on my way, ayy, yeah

[Chorus]
So tell me right now, what's it gon' be?
I don't need love, got a hunnid' on me
Don't want it any other way
Want it any other way
So tell me right now, what's it gon' be?

Don't want it any other way
Want it any other way

[Bridge]
But I'm back here waiting for something else to happen
You got my heart and you know it, yeah
And I'm just waiting for someone else to come get it
But you got it, you know it

[Chorus]
So tell me right now, what's it gon' be?
I don't need love, got a hunnid' on me
Don't want it any other way

Some days I'm lonely
And some days I'm not
Some days I am only
A little bit sad, not a lot

[Pre-Chorus]
How do you
How do you make a home?
What to do?
'Cause I never stay too long

[Chorus]
Every house looks the same in my dreams
Every house feels like home for a couple weeks
I've been runnin' 'round trying to find a
Place where I can breathe
But me oh my
I found you under an April sky
And you feel like
City life, apple pie baked just right
Home is wherever you are tonight

[Verse 2]
Some days feel empty
Some days feel whole
Someday we can be in the same city
Someday we'll be grown and I'll be
Fine with packing up
Cardboard boxes filled and sad farewells
And I'll be fine with that goodbye
As long as I don't say goodbye to you as well

[Chorus]
'Cause every house looks the same in my dreams
Every house feels like home for a couple weeks
I’ve been runnin' 'round trying to find a
Place where I can breathe
But me oh my
I found you under an April sky
And you feel like
City life, apple pie baked just right
Home is wherever you are tonight

[Bridge]
Let's rent a place
Two rooms and a window facing
Buildings and fire escapes
Might be no AC
A little bit cramped
But see if I'm with you, it's okay
(Mmmmm)

[Outro]
Me oh my
I found you under an April sky
And you feel like
City life, apple pie baked just right
Home is wherever you are tonight

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Hello, happiness
Hello, honeymoon
Hello, passionate love, where the fuck was you?
I been waitin' all my life just for you
Am I in love with you, or am I just confused?
Baby, you was the one to come save me
Tell the world I wasn't crazy
But lately, your mind just isn't here no more
What did I do?
You not a bitch, just always angry
But it's so difficult to hate me
I'm the closest thing to home you'll ever know

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, why you so mad at me?
Let you have all of my love and it's still not enough, shit
Why you so hard to please?
Gave you every single part of me
You're never satisfied
Satisfied
Never satisfied
Satisfied
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Hello for the night, it ain't complicated
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, ain't no obligation
Not a single string attached, this ain't a puppet show
You didn't want to fall in love, you made her come and go
Yeah, she was only here so I forget her
And be distracted by the pleasure
It's way too painful to remember
So I get faded and pretend it's all good
And when I'm underneath the weather
Tryin' to keep my shit together
I never surrender

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, why you so mad at me?
Let you have all of my love and it's still not enough, shit
Why you so hard to please?
Gave you every single part of me
You're never satisfied
Satisfied
Never satisfied
Satisfied
Yeah

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yuh, yeah, yeah, okay

[Verse 1]
Cup of coffee in the mornin', but the mornin' when the sun down
Stayin' up late night
Take a swim with great whites, all I need is daylight
I'm tryna be a billionaire, she tryna be a playwright
Something 'bout this ain't right
Paint a picture on the wall
Better use your mind and you will find there's no such thing as law
Had that goddamn in '09, that holy shit the next year
Standin' on the coastline, the flows a bit too wet here
Most these motherfuckers are so easy to forget here
Toast to those who hold your own
I'm coast to coast through postal codes
The flow is cold as overcoats, I'm blowin' smoke at police
Fuck 'em, we ain't never gonna trust 'em, let me go free

[Chorus]
Hit the road
You ain't doin' shit at home
Better get up out the crib and figure this out on your own
If you never live, you never know
If you never live, you never know
We, drink alone
Plottin' how to get some dough
Rollin' up the weed and watchin' Indiana Jones, but
If we never live, we'll never know
If we never live, we'll never know (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
What's the difference 'tween a bitch and a bitch?
Well, a bitch ain't a bitch when his bitch start trippin'
Shit, I been smart
Spittin' by the benchmark
Wisdom of a Templar
This shit like liftin' with my left arm
Yeah, no need to wonder who your friends are
The Devil probably comin' for your soul when it get dark
So thank God all the time and protect art
Life is the beginning, best be ready for the next part
I swear to God they gon' feel me
Better get a job and get busy
I'm like a God in my city
Don't trust nobody, my shit be crazy
Better get up off yo' ass, somebody gon' pay me
Don't keep me waitin', yeah
And only God can judge me
When all the glamour go away, you only left with money
So I'm stackin' everyday I'm at the crib in clothes that's bummy
All them things you say don't mean a thing to me
Don't trust nobody

[Chorus]
Hit the road
You ain't doin' shit at home
Better get up out the crib and figure this out on your own
If you never live, you never know
If you never live, you never know
We, drink alone
Plottin' how to get some dough
Rollin' up the weed and watchin' Indiana Jones, but
If we never live, we'll never know
If we never live, we'll never know

[Verse 3]
Yeah
Hold your temper, the flow can go forever
Fuck these little snakes, I got a cobra on the dresser
The flow is texture, colder than the snowy weather
You don't think that I'm the greatest, need to get to know me better
In a polo sweater and I'm chillin' for the weekend
Standin' in some muddy waters, swimmin' in the deep end, yeah
My bitch is sleepin', but I'm out here livin' decent
Pissin' on a fire engine, got me shittin' on the cement
I'm a dog, but aware of all my flaws
I'm a martyr for the cause
On the run, never bring it to a jog, no
This my job, though
Hit 'em with the crossbow
While I'm at the crib makin' tacos out of waffles
The God awful
Lookin' for apostles
The flow is old and dirty, but the people like it raw, though
I feel colossal
Savage man, I'm macho
Last forever, never gonna stop, no

[Chorus]
Hit the road
You ain't doin' shit at home
Better get up out the crib and figure this out on your own
If you never live, you never know
If you never live, you never know
We, drink alone
Plottin' how to get some dough
Rollin' up the weed and watchin' Indiana Jones, but
If we never live, we'll never know
If we never live, we'll never know
On ma wrists, diamond kings, yellow diamonds look like this
I turn up in the club, turn up when I pull up

I don't play no games so d-d-don't-don't-don't get it confused, no
'Cause you will lose, yeah
Now, now pu-pu-pu-pu-pump it up
And back it up, like a Tonka truck
That badonkadonk is like a trunk full of bass on an old school Chevy
Seven-trey donkey donk
All I need is some vodka and some chonky Coke
And watch, shit gon' get Donkey Konged (Hahaha)
Baby, if you're ready for things to get heavy

I know you got it, clap your hands on the floor (Hey)
And keep on rocking, rock it up on the floor
If you're a criminal, kill it on the floor
Steal it quick on the floor, on the floor
Don't stop, keep it moving, put your drinks up
It's getting ill, it's getting sick on the floor
We never quit, we never rest on the floor
If I ain't wrong, we'll probably die on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza

Oh sweet as a melody, girl you’re the lyrics to my song

[Intro]
Uh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I was just a youngin' with nothin' and doin' nothin'
Pocket full of buttons and hopefully you niggas push 'em
Banana clips are my Republic, while we on the subject
Wrote this with my feet up on the table, I was on my tushie
Hopin' they swim with toughin' 'cause most of you niggas cushion
High school was where they flunked 'em, I was failin' every subject
My favorite class was bathroom, the hallway and lunch, gym
The skeletons in my closet, no Indians in my cupboard
Only time it was YMCA was when we was hoopin'
See a baddie with some Prada and baby heads, we was cuffin'
Fuck it, appreciate the pretty things, but shit is rugged
Came into the world with nothin', best to leave with somethin'
Fuck it

[Bridge]
Ooh, uh, uh
Moves, make your moves, uh
Ooh, uh, uh
The game is all, uh
Ooh, uh, uh
The game is all-

[Verse 2]
She was just a youngin', the beginning days of lovin'
Before she desired clubbin', nails and designer luggage
Before the extra baggage, shortie would travel with no one
She was posted up with moneys, but cellphones came with the buttons

[Interlude]
You don't wanna pick up my call, bitch?
You send me to voicemail, bitch?
Where the fuck you at, bitch?
I pay the motherfuckin' rent, bitch
Where the fuck you at, bitch?
I love you baby, please call me back

[Verse 3]
Her mama boost and smuggle, her daddy knew how to hustle
This shit is like a circus, either die or learn to juggle
The concrete jungle, every day was a struggle
Weave down to her navel so they call that ho Rapunzel
Name plane, Erin, name plate on her buckle
Name tatted on her arm, fluctuate from muscle
Fast forward to all the troubles, who knew the future would crumble
Just a kid blowin' bubbles, man look at what the world has come to
Got to fuck on random tricks, when she don't want to
Got to suck on random dick, hopin' that he comes soon, damn

[Intro: Mack 10, Birdman & Lil Wayne ]
Homie we don’t get in the slam dunk contest no mo, you know how that go dog
To all you cats. However, from the block to the rats. Cash Money got this shit, right. So I'mma let my lil' soldier, Lil' Weezy Wee, shut this game down, for me, homie
Okay, listen

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Homie I go hard, push a whip with no hair on his head
So all I’m feeling is air on my head
With some broad that you might know, she blowin' all the air out my head
If you play I’ll knock a square out your head
Sip the Crissy clear out my head, try to get my loot up
In Cuba with a translator, get the coke newer
Plus the prices is cooler, I come back to the hood with that dirty
Tell 'em I'm like Tiger Woods, all I got is birdies
Got women’s in they thirties calling Weezy papa
But Weezy not daddy ma 'cause Weezy in and out chea
Weezy never spouse ya, Weezy give sh*t bout’ cha
Weezy don’t master suite, Weezy living room couch ya
How bout you be a good girl, take these pies I just cooked up
Take me to those tiger paws on your thighs
Get’s high 'til I can’t focus, but the main focus is to remain focused, they ain't’ focused, holla back

[Interlude: Birdman]
...

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Listen, I come up from a shh deep town
Where you hear sounds like click, squeak, pow!
Get down or your dying
People tote iron
Got that coke flying like birds-not the ones with feathers
I’m talking weight like birds
And you might get served if it’s proper enough
Or find your nerves on a curve if you’re a copper or something
A baller blocker or something
I’ll send your noggin a hundred
Have the whole block sprint, dashing, jogging and running
Type of life I live, Gotti would love it
Squad property buddy, some young cats with a Mafia budget
Can’t nobody put nobody above it
If they do they find they body with they body above it, come on let’s take it public
Nah leave it in the gutter
Ayy let's go and dump him
Nah leave him in the gutter

[Interlude: Birdman]
...

[Verse 3: Cadillac]
Check me
Now I got this game on lock with pounds and chickens
Give me 600 an ounce and 10 for the pigeons
I flood my community, I love this shhh
I think the FEDs done been in my house and bugged the shhh
Now I’m running everything from the hall in the blizzock
And I'm riding in the vol with my dog with no tizzop
Got a .40 in the arm rest and in the lap is the glizzock
I done copped a little platinum and I blessed it with rizzocks
The way a nigga live is unbelievable
And im riding round' in something you'd never seen before
Better watch your baby mama before I ceased it yo

[Verse 1]
Hey, brother
There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey, sister
Know the water's sweet but blood is thicker

[Refrain]
Oh, if the sky comes falling down
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Verse 2]
Hey, brother
Do you still believe in one another?
Hey, sister
Do you still believe in love?
I wonder

[Refrain]
Oh, if the sky comes falling down
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Chorus]
What if I'm far from home?
Oh brother, I will hear you call
What if I lose it all?
Oh sister, I will help you out
Oh, if the sky comes falling down
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Verse 3]
Hey, brother
There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey, sister
Do you still believe in love? I wonder

[Refrain]
Oh, if the sky comes falling down
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Chorus]
What if I'm far from home?
Oh brother, I will hear you call
What if I lose it all?
Oh sister, I will help you out
Oh, if the sky comes falling down
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Verse 1]
Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open
But it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holding on too tight
With nothing in between

[Chorus]
The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen
The story of my life
I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke inside
The story of my life

[Verse 2]
Written on these walls are the colours that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning, now
I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holding on so tight
With nothing in between

[Chorus]
The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen
The story of my life
I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke inside
The story of my life

[Bridge]
And I been waiting for this time to come around
But, baby, running after you
Is like chasing the clouds, Oh

[Breakdown]
The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen

[Chorus]
The story of my life
I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke inside
The story of my life
The story of my life
The story of my life
The story of my life

[Verse 1]
I'd sell my soul just to see your face
And I'd break my bones just to heal your pain
In these times I need a saving grace
But time is running out
And I'm starting to lose my faith

[Chorus]
But if I told you I loved you
Would it make you want to stay
I'm sorry for the way I hurt you
And making you walk away
I should have took the time to tell you
And if I wrote you a love song
And sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay
I can't go another day without you
Would it make you, make you wanna stay
Girl you gotta know I love you

[Verse 2]
My heart's on my sleeve but it's turning black
I guess I know what it feels like it to be alone
Without your touch I'm not gonna last
I know you know that I need ya just to carry on
It feels like my walls are caving in
You'd always hold me before I left you hanging on
And I'll do anything to have you here again

[Chorus]
But if I told you I loved you
Would it make you want to stay
I'm sorry for the way I hurt you
And making you walk away
I should have took the time to tell you
And if I wrote you a love song
And sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay
I can't go another day without you
Would it make you, make you wanna stay
Girl you gotta know I love you

[Verse 3]
Yeah, the days are cold
The nights are long
I can't stand to be alone
Please know this is not your fault
And all I want is to tell you I love you
And make you wanna stay
There's gotta be a way
Cause going on without you is killing me everyday

[Verse 4]
And if I wrote you a love song
And sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay
I can't go another day without you
Would it make you, make you wanna stay
Girl, you gotta know I love you
Would it make you, make you wanna stay
I can't go another day without you
Would it make you, make you wanna stay

[Intro: from Taxi Driver]
Listen you fuckers, you screw-heads
Here is a man who would not take it anymore
A man who stood up against the scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit
Here is a man who stood up
Here is—

Easy Mac, yo
Yeeah!

[Verse 1]
I start wars like Star Wars, I'm the emperor
Waiting with patience in this nation, I'm the predator
And if you hating you'll get served with some metaphors
You in the cypher spittin' shit that you've said before
Your shits regular, I've heard it before
I murder it raw
When it switch it droppin' ya jaw
I'm never stoppin'
I got more options than the quarterback
I'm more than that
I'm dedicated, you just sorta rap
A gram of haze for 25, that's a quarter sack
I gotchu on the half, if you wanna order that
Yeah and it'll cost ya, I'm not a slave
But you can shop and save if you cop an eighth
Watch the block for cops, cops coppin' dro
Call 'em corrupt but they (pigs) got a lotta dough
You're monotone, you're actin' like its hard to flow
Homie, you're at fourth down with forty yards to go
I'm a junior but I rap like a veteran
Get more cheddar than anybody that I'm better than
Lemme tell you I spit the shredder
Its sure guaranteed to put the marks in ya sweater

[Chorus]
Easy Mac but my mackin' ain't easy
See the rapper, instant satisfaction when you see me
Be the rapper but you lackin' what it takes to be me
And you can find me where the trees be

[Verse 2]
Cats before ass 'cause I'm out to get rich
Bitches surrounded my dick, I'm countin' my chips
Without it I slip, trip over the foot that they kick
Ain't got cheese for the trees, then don't look at my brick (nope)
The industries infantry, penalties in vanity
The enemy up in the streets, secondaries up in the beef
Chemically I break you down, shots then I take the town
Funeral, I fake the frown
Lay you down and take the crown
Had to take a stand against his castle made in sand
Win the battle with the man, taken apples from a dam
Had to bomb Babylon, the weed you needs in catalog
If you were cream, I had it wrong
Who gives a shits about his mom?
Kickin' competition with the limited edition
And my ambition is I have the proper composition
I deserve the recognition, I'm amazing— definition
Puttin' victims in submission, spittin' each and every sentence (yup)
Too hot like the pot up in ya kitchen
And if you quitcha bitchin' the bitches'll stop snitchin'
I spit it ill, sick like raw chicken
But I'm finger lickin' freestyle king, watch me kill a written

[Chorus]
Easy Mac but my mackin' ain't easy
See the rapper, instant satisfaction when you see me
Be the rapper but you lackin' what it takes to be me
And you can find me where the trees be, it's easy

[Outro]
Chyeah!
Easy Mac, homie
(Yeaaaaaaah)
Put ya blunts out, song's over
Pittsburgh, Point Breeze
Shoutout to my man Sweet James, D-Wreck, BJ, P-Doom, Sammy Slick, B-Dubb, the whole crew, homie
You know where you at

Take yourself a picture when I'm standing at the mound
And I swear it's going down, I'm just repping for my town
Off a cup of C.J Gibson, man I'm faded off the brown
And I’m easily influenced by the niggas I'm around
See that Aston Martin, when I start it hear the sound
I ain't never graduated, I ain't got no cap and gown
But the girls in my class who were smart enough to pass
Be at all my fucking parties, grabbing money off the ground

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, all hail Mr. Lyrical
Spades or the Opus, baby, what you got a feeling for?
I can show you new things, have you feeling spiritual
Pastor Kerney Thomas to these hoes - miwacles

Some say that I'm their favorite but I ain't hearing none of that
I’m about my team, ho, Young Money running back
Cash Money superstar, where the fuck is Stunna at?
Damn

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
I just got a new deal, I ain't talking pickle
I'm outside the cell, while you rappers just sickle
Soulja Boy is Superman, the hip-hop hero
She sucking all over my body, call her mosquito
The cheese is all on me, just like a Dorito
Disrespect and you'll get shot like a free throw
I go hard, never ever go soft
Always swag on, never ever swag off
Greatest rapper of the century
Got more bars than a fucking penitentiary
Ever since elementary
Blueberry kush, I call it Fruit Roll-Up
And when I wake up, I be baking like soda
My pockets fat like my jeans made by Oprah
In your house, on your sister wall is my poster
Fucking models, doing shows just like I'm supposed to
My lifestyle extravagant, attitude arrogant

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Cash Money, fast money
Everyday I'm paper chasing
Tryna get the dollars

This shit came a long way from Tommy Hilfiger (A long way)

And I think my favorite girl be skippin' class (Ooh)
Introduce her to Barbie world, she just shop for bags (Ooh)
She just wanna keep me smilin', never leave me mad (Ooh)
I jumped the gate 'cause I was tryna throw the brick
I can't get caught with it 

[?] (Yeah, yeah)
I jumped in woods 'cause I had to throw the stick
'Cause this camouflage green and they won't find it (They won't find it)
Lowlife nigga, we just stack and get the gold (Lowlife)
I don't wanna hurt no one (Hurt)
Inglewood bloods with my right now
Boy, you better pipe down
We sleep in the lobby
AK for these pussy niggas thinkin' they got stamina
Tell me that ain't Nipsey I just seen on that camera
I can't visit no sight, fuck a candle
I can't see him in a casket like my grandpa
I can't see how niggas let him get shot
Doubled back, then ran up on him and nobody but him died
Tried to give a nigga benefits, but really, I cannot
And I can only imagine the tears on his momma's and his wife's eyes
That his face on the kid's shirt, they don't even know why
I'm like "Oh my"
Oh my God, oh my God
Troup couldn't even see, the shit was blindsided
Nipsey couldn't even see, the shit was blindsided
Left a real nigga caressin' on a thotty now
Rich nigga, rich presence in his momma eyes
Big homie in all of his partner eyes
Double back, triple...

[Refrain: Tory Lanez]
I tell lil' mama, "Fuck who you want, but don't get mad at me when I fuck who I want"

[Verse 1]
Places that you could wanna be cooped up
I know the truth, yeah, like how I move, huh
You got your tongue-tied, got a divine vibe
Let's go from Hennessy to red and white wine vibes
See you require time, you need some quiet time
Now you can't fuck no one that fucked you in their side time
They try to hide love, girl, I provide mine
I know the guidelines that I gotta abide by
Oh, Miami nights, I'm in the Benz, Ocean Drive prime
Tryna never let you in again but you gon' slide by
Always give me reason in the seasons where I need you
Things you say in public, I would rather keep in secret
But, you know that I love all of that ignorant shit you're talkin'
Dick you down in your apartment
You know everythin' 'bout it like it's your store and your department
We be goin' off too often
I be goin' so hard that I'm exhausted
Now we need to lay our feet up
Laid up on my chest while I confess that you be movin' way too fast to keep up
When you talkin' body language, you don't have to speak up
If you woulda kept this shit one hundred, I wouldn't have had to creep up
Oh, no, no

[Chorus]
Do me how you do me
You gon' do you and I'ma do me
Shawty, we been in that hot pursuit
You've been doin' you, I think it's time that I do me
Do me how you do me
You gon' do you and I'ma do me
Shawty, we been in that hot pursuit
You've been doin' you, I think it's time that I do me

[Verse 2]
Laces that you should, never be stooped up
You seem to find yourself whenever you get liquor drunk and juiced up
I've been at a full stop, tryna get you moved up
I ain't tryna wait, no
You know how a player go
I got certain feelings for you, I ain't tryna say it though
Somethin' 'bout the body language that you speakin'
S-T-O-P the games, let that freak shit begin
Work got you busy on the weekdays
So I'm in the deep phase up until that weekend begin
Know your shit a movie, so I'm sneakin', peekin'
Tell your nigga sue me, he be reachin', reachin'
I don't know your mixture
I got cold intentions when I'm scrollin' through the 'Gram
You see me goin' through your pictures
I be goin' through these phases, you goin' through these niggas
Never figured you be doggin' me like I be doggin' bitches
Shit is ironic, isn't it? Ayy

[Chorus]
Do me how you do me
You gon' do you and I'ma do me
Shawty, we been in that hot pursuit
You've been doin' you, I think it's time that I do me
Do me how you do me
You gon' do you and I'ma do me
Shawty, we been in that hot pursuit
You've been doin' you, I think it's time that I do me

I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

[Verse 2]
You're my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
Can’t let me know I'm wanted
Can’t let me in your head
I'm not here to make you kneel
But it's praise that I get
You ain't gonna walk free boy
Not finished with you yet, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I’m coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

[Bridge]
Oh, you're down right there
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there
We just make it right there
'Cause you're looking so right there
Baby, you should touch me right there
If you take me right there
We could make it

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell

Something that money can't buy
Fighting in fits
Biting your lip
Loving 'til late in the night

Tell me I'm too crazy

Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside

*Lyrics from Snippet 1*

[Chorus: Kanye West & Charlie Wilson with Ty Dolla $ign]
'Cause, baby, you're awesome
Don't let nobody bring you down
You're so awesome

*Lyrics from Snippet 2*

[Verse: Kanye West]
I gotta move, I gotta dance
I gotta live, I gotta love
I gotta hope, I got a chance
'Cause baby, you're awesome

*Lyrics from Snippet 3*

[Chorus: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Don't let nobody bring you down
You're so awesome, you're so after park
You're so after dark (Woah)
You're so sleepness nights (Yeah, yeah)
Ooh, this feels so right

[Verse 1]
There's no use trying to relate to that older soul
And no use trying to debate that they've got it wrong
There's no use pining for love when you're on your own
And no use crying outside if nobody's home
There's no use flying to the moon if they won't believe
So why do I go wrong on repeat?

[Refrain]
I was blinded by a memory
Like it's someone else, like it wasn't me
And there's every chance I'll be learning fast
And the day will come and then it will pass

[Chorus]
What do you want when I say I won't?
And though I try, I do the same, as though I must
And in the air of today is tomorrow's dust

[Verse 2]
There's no use trying to relate to that older soul
And no use biding your time if the bell is tolled

[Refrain]
I was blinded by a memory
Like it's someone else, like it wasn't me
And there's every chance I'll be learning fast
And the day will come and then it will pass

[Bridge]
Sympathy for the fauna
Fragile life in the sauna
In the sea getting warmer
Endlessly 'round the corner

[Chorus]
And though I try, I do the same, as though I must
And in the air of today is tomorrow's dust

Just another day
Money to made
Got my hataz blockaz for them haters that gon hate
I don't give middle fuck middle finger as I ride they gone hate me until me

I kno you hate me
Tell em keep hatin

Counting money rubberbands all on the floor
Its hot as fuck so I'm sippin on the H20
Windows down with no sound so I cruise mute
New 300  throwing money out the sun roof
I'm in my car like star got the windows tinted
People walking by thinking who the fuck is in it
When haters talk they always bring my name up
Tell yo favorite rapper's ghost writer to step his game up

(Chorus 2x)

Soulja boy concert more packed than the georgia dome
I need a another Million get Collipark on the phone
I'm ahead of the game like the world flipped
Gucci boxers on my dick like yo girl lips
A diss song aimed at me will get yo girl killed
My album certified platinum when it world shipped
Soulja boy  coming wit hits do u not see the pattern
If he's better than me, I can breathe on saturn
(Chorus 2x)

I go so hard like an erection
Bulletproof vest but its no for protection
Soulja boy for president fuck the election
I kno what I said don't make no corrections
Make your selection. The 1st is impression
Ya girl on knees but she not getting blessings
I'm givin u lessons on how I detect it
Niggas already hating and I just checked in

(Beat Plays Out)
Shut the block down, like a CPU
Flyin down on 20 windows tinted we see you
Thats what the drop do it make the hoes flock bitch
I threw a concert on the block and call it block (billin/buildin?)
Money in the ceilin, stashed in the buildin
Poppin penicillin, damn i'm hurtin niggas feelings
Soulja boy the truth, that's real pimpin'
I spit real ish, def'ly not fiction
Money slippin out my hand call it cash friction
Call me DJ Khaled, bitch listen
My bracelet got a headache, watch in a coma
That bitch froze, it ain't tickin bout 2 summers
Now lemme do numbers, lemme make history
A bet a mil I can make yo girl get wit me
Lyrics off the chain everytime I hit a beat
These instrumentals dead, (get this boy a ----?)

Mirror mirror mirror on the wall (boy what it do?)
Who the biggest balla of them all (Soulja you the truth)
Every time i step in the mall (it's a photo shoot)
Girl get yo camera phone, it's funna be a photo shootIt's a photo shoot (ay) (x8)(ay) girl takin pictures
Whole clique tipsy, like we sippin liquor
Chain got disease, I can't even see
Hop out the chevy cameras ready and they blindin me
I'm invisible, plain invisible
And the only student make more money than the principal
Teachers gettin mad (why?) cuz i made it rain
Fuck a teacher plan (?) I got a hundred grand
I got a hundred goons, all of em comin soon
Broad day light get yo ass in the afternoon
I roll wit money gang SOD goon squad
Yeah i'm rich but yo ass still can get robbed
I got no black cars but I got a black jag
Flyin down 285 wit no license tag
Run em, get em, got em, shot em, boy what it do
Fans rushin to the soulja for the photo shoot
Mirror mirror mirror on the wall (boy what it do?)
Who the biggest balla of them all (Soulja you the truth)

Chain got the flu, watch got a cold
Earrings got pneumonia (achoo!) got my body froze (i'm sick!)

[Verse 1 - Dennis Edwards]
When morning comes and finds me
I'll be living in a dream
The sun will be shining
Everything smiling with me

Tonight I lay here in your arms
Beside your naked skin
Oh, what a feeling
Starting to flow out of me

[Pre Chorus]
Girl, we paint a pretty picture
In a pretty room
On a pretty bed
And the things you say!

[Chorus]
It's like I'm living in a dream world, baby
Far away from the pains of reality
Moving gently through the twilight lady
You've got me flying up high on wings of love
Oh baby, wings of love

[Chorus]

{Verse 2]
Inside your arms close to your heart
That's where I want to stay
The pleasure you give me
Is more than these words I can say

All the world and all that's gold
Can't buy this way I feel
A treasure forever and diamonds don't sparkle like love

[Pre Chorus]
'Cause you gave to me a feeling
That has changed my life
That has changed my mind
When you gave me love!

Yeah!

[Chorus}

Oh baby, wings of love

[Chorus}

[Backing Vocals]
You've got me dreaming. You got me dreaming. You got me dreaming all the time

[Repeat throughout the end]

Additional vocals:
Got me dreaming, got me, got me dreaming, got me dreaming

[Repeat throughout the end]

[Verse 1 - Dennis Edwards]
I'm on a big ship
On the high waves (?) of time
I've followed every dream in life
That ever crossed my mind
Beyond each horizon
I find less that I left behind

[Pre Chorus]
Oh, how I miss you, Mary Ann
I'd love to taste your love again
My sail's awaiting for the wind

[Chorus]
Mary Ann!
Mary Ann!
Mary! Ann!

{Verse 2]
Out in the sea of doubt
I weathered every storm
I'm the captain of my ship
A sailor, I was born
I've had queens in castles
On clouds in the sky

[Pre Chorus]
But my heart sent to you, Mary Ann
My mind's on coming home again
My sail's awaiting for the wind

[Chorus]
Mary Ann!
Mary Ann!
Mary! Ann!

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I'd like to imagine you on the shores at dawn
And you, oh my pretty one, gentle as a fawn
And as I row my boat ashore
My dream is that we go home baby

[Pre Chorus]
Oh how I miss you Mary Ann
I'd love to be back home again
My sail's awaiting for the wind

[Chorus]
Mary Ann!
Mary Ann!
Mary! Ann!

[Instrumental Outro]
Paradise
Is being here with you
Close to your heart
Oh, the sweet harmony
Is beautiful

Ooh!

Tenderly
You receive my love
I release myself
And we are one


Flowing deep like a river
You rejoice and sigh
And we are one

Ooh!

In your eyes
I see a open door that leads to your heart
Oh, the way to your soul
Is beautiful
Paradise!

A picture is
Worth a thousand words
A feeling is worth
It all and more

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Flowing deep
Like a river
You rejoice and sigh
And we are one

Ooh!

Paradise
Is being here with you
Close to your heart
Oh, the sweet harmony
Is beautiful

[Intro]
Why can't we get together?  

[x4]

You and me!

[Chorus]
Why can't you and me get together?
What I wanna know is
Why can't you and me get together?

[Verse 1 - Richard Street and Glenn Leonard]
It seems I see you everywhere I go
At the beach
The show
And even at the disco

But every time I get close to you
You get away
Oh, yes you do

So I came to the tennis court
Because i heard that you love the sport!
Why can't you?

[Chorus]
Why can't you and me get together?
What I wanna know is
Why can't you and me get together?

You and me!

[Verse 2]
Tennis court
I don't know the sport
The game I came to play is of a different sort

But if i have to play to get next to you...

I brought a racket and two brand new tennis shoes

See what you made me do for you
Now won't you let me get
Next to you!

[Chorus]
Why can't you and me get together?
What I wanna know is
Why can't you and me get together?

[Bridge]
Why can't we get together? 

[x3]
You and me!

[Verse 3]
Now there's a method to my madness
And the crazy way that I come on
You look so good so I
I had to meet ya
Just to let you know where I'm coming from

The tennis court is a funny place to start
I came to let you know you've captured my heart!

[Chorus]
Why can't you and me get together? (right now baby!)
What I want to know is
Why can't you and me get together? (a-right now! a-right now! now! now!)
Why can't you and me get together?
What I wanna know is
Why can't you and me get together?

[Outro]
Why can't you, and me, together 

[x3]

[Intro: B-DuBB]
B-DuBB, Easy Mac
Who is—
Who is the man that taught ya how to rap and how to sell crack, boozes, maaaan?
Foolin', we get down like this

[Verse 1: B-DuBB]
Ay yo, it's like, check it
Beedie shot ya, whatcha gon' do?
Heatie pops ya
I'm sonnin' ya style, call me papa
Pop of a Glock, that's the sound when I drop ya
Stuff ya body parts in a locker
Runnin' from the cops, Willy Parker
And I ain't gonna walk on ya set get you wet
Cause ya set full of talkers
Straight snitches, I'll punch you in the face
Leave you with eight stithces, bitches I play viscous

[Verse 2: Easy Mac]
Title is inevitable, I'm incredible
Got lames hidin' behind frames like I was federal
The fuckin' general, suck up on my genitals
My flow's outta this world like I got some tentacles
I'm with the pencil to murder instrumentals
I'm spittin' ammunition, you better listen to potential
I'm fifteens years with no restrictions on the mental
My mind flows as I go, I follow where I'm sent to

[Verse 3: B-DuBB]
Me and Mac blow ya back when we writin' it
Or freestylin' on some ill, that's excitement
Keep a fat a sack and a gat at the side of him
And kiss ya snakes tryna take what I'm hidin' in
I spit it slick, so sick need a vitamin

Aim it at ya forehead, leavin' four dead
Bust in the door with lead and whores spread
I'm a warhead, looking for more head
Fuckin' on the floor til I gotta sore head
Pussy lips drippin' stingin' like a hornet
Kickin' bitches out the door in the mornin'
Rappers tryna spit it but the shit is corny
I ain't even wit it, man forreal

[Verse 4: Easy Mac]
I'm not the best in school but I'm set for college
Cause when the bitch give me brains, yo I get some knowledge
I keep a few close friends and the rest will tarnish
A few respectable rappers, the rest are garbage
I proceed to gain yardage, this ain't Dwayne Carter
I make it rain harder, game remain slaughter
My brain remains smarter and you stay retarded
You better add another name to today's departed

[Verse 5: B-DuBB]
I never wake up and lose my skill
I get baked up and use em, ew!
The music real and every day I be movin' bills
Makin' cake, hittin' jakes, puttin' dudes in jail

[Verse 6: Easy Mac]
And I'll tell you what they say right before they arrest you
Anything you say can and will be used against you
And even though they got no reason to resent you
They treat you like you got a set of criminal credentials
And me and B-DuBB are here to murder the game
We gon' spit off every minute until you heard of the name
We kickin' it exquisite, sittin' and gettin' lifted
Bangin' music until the neighbor's pissed and I'm evicted

[Verse 7: B-DuBB]
Cause I be gettin' verbs workin' until I hear them birds chirpin'
Yeah preferred first person in here, you heard certain
Flirtin' with the lyrical spheres, ya ears hurtin'
Merkin' every peer that appear, ya fears worsen

[Outro: B-DuBB]
I thought ya mothafuckas already knew
Easy Mac but his mackin' ain't easy
And next comin' up is Beedie
Kill the shit
(I'm on fire) I'm on fire
(Ooh ooh ooh)

(I'm on fire) for you

I look at you
And I get hot all over
'Cause
You got me burnin' for you

(I'm on fire) Fire! oh oh!
Baby!

(I'm on fire) for you

(I hold you in my arms)
(my love rises to the stars)

'Cause you got me burning for you

Let me touch you
Everywhere I want to
'Cause I can't wait no longer
This feeling keeps getting stronger!
Baby baby
Let me have you (got me burning)
My whole (my body's yearning for you)

[Spoken Word]
I'm burning
I'm yearning
Oh
I'm needing you
Oh baby, you've got me tasting

(Give me some!) I'm on fire
Baby!
(I'm on fire) You've got me burning
Got me yearning

'Cause you got me burning
My (whole) body's yearning for you

Baby
Oh, baby (for you)

Am I real?
Do I feel
These things that I feel?
Do you feel them too?
I’m drowning in glue

Tears, they fall
Down my pink cheeks
They don’t have homes
Landing wherever they fall
Are you okay?
Not at all

Leave
Watch as I fall
Watch as it all rains down in time
Leave
Watch me my love
Watch as the dove begins to fly

I fall in love
Every time I hear your name
Listless and strong
About what I used to claim
Don’t call me back
But then maybe I want you to care
You can’t look back
But then how will you know if he’s there
It’s like walking through sand
Trying to fall
Out of love
On command
Never quite reaching the end
I’m trying to pretend

Leave
Watch as I crawl
Watch as the sky turns purple-blue
Leave
Watch me begin
It’s not a sin to still love you

I fall in love
Every time I hear your name
Listless and strong
About what I used to claim
Don’t call me back
But then maybe I want you to care
You can’t look back
But then have will you know if he’s

There are so many things that remind me of you
I need to get out, leave for my sanity soon
There are so many things that remind me
I need to get out, leave for my sanity
There are so many things that remind me
I need to get out, leave for my sanity
There are too many things that remind me of you
I need to get out, leave for my sanity soon

[Verse 1]
You can strut
Your stuff
If you think you man enough
Utilize
Your charm
To lure her into your arms
You can play (your games)
But you'll find it's all in vain

[Pre Chorus]
(You can run off at the mouth all day)
About how you're gonna pull my lady away
I think you underestimate just what I mean to her

[Chorus]
Cause she's a one man woman
And I'm the one you see
(One man woman)
A one man woman
Who saves her love for me
(One man woman)
A one man woman
She don't love casually
And I know
(I know)
I know
(I know) The girl is mine

Ain't no doubt about it
She's a one man woman
And I'm gonna keep her mine all mine

[Verse 2]
Well you can waste
Your time
Trying to take what's mine
Saying this, oh, and that (that)
Sneaking all around like an alley cat
You wanna jump (jump!) her bones (bones!)
Just to satisfy the Jones (?)

(You can run off at the mouth all day)
About how you're gonna pull my lady away

I think you underestimate just what I mean to her

[Chorus]
Cause she's a one man woman
And I'm the one you see
(One man woman)
A one man woman
Who saves her love for me
(One man woman)
A one man woman
She don't love casually
And I know
(I know)
I know
(I know) The girl is mine

Ain't no doubt about it
She's a one man woman
And I'm gonna keep her mine all mine

[Bridge]
Hey man!
I'm talking to you!
We've got some serious rapping to do
Now brother, you come around here talking your jive
And messing with the girl like I ain't still alive
Well you best be leaving...
Leaving this place
And get your bad self out of my face you mother!
The rich red wine may kiss the glass
And you my friend
Farewell!

[Chorus]
Cause she's a one man woman
And I'm the one you see
(One man woman)
A one man woman
Who saves her love for me
(One man woman)
A one man woman
She don't love casually
And I know
(I know)
I know
(I know) The girl is mine

Ain't no doubt about it
She's a one man woman
And I'm gonna keep her mine all mine


Come on with me y'all

[scatting until fade out]

[Verse 1]
I never knew any one woman's love
Could have such an effect on me
Reaches down in my heart, (way down)
Fires up my soul
Brings out all the needs in me, ooh!

[Chorus]
Give it up baby, baby give it up
(I said baby give it up) 

[x2]
I'm coming back for more
So open your doors
Ooh baby
I've got an ever ready love
Woo hoo baby
I got an ever ready love

[Verse 2]
How did I ever underestimate
What the love of a woman can do
When, darling pound for pound
I admit I've found
All the best love in you, ooh!

[Chorus]
Give it up baby, baby give it up
(I said baby give it up) 

[x2]
I'm coming back for more
So open your doors
Ooh baby
I've got an ever ready love, take it baby
Woo hoo baby
I got an ever ready love, just for you girl

(Ever ready love) 

[x2]

Ooh, give it up baby, baby give it up

It's Sean and Weezy, Weezy 

[x8]
Let's ride (ya mon!) and get high (Kingston!)
Let's ride, and get high
We don't back down, I'm laying the smack down
I'm sorry but you're never gonna see me fall
We don't back down, we movin' in packs now
I'm sorry but you niggas don't scare me at all
We don't back down, we makin' them stacks now
I'm sorry but we're just gonna continue to ball
We don't back down, I'm stating the facts now
But you niggas never gonna see us fall

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Chea!
Young and famous
Still armed and dangerous
Real nigga, take my own charge like LaDainian
Wild like a, Tasmanian devil, metal your cranium
I got my guap in a headlock; wrestlemania
Ha! man, I do what I do, look at all the bullshit I been through
Some call beef with you know who - but I turn that to beef stew
Rapper eater eat you, and if we stop the beat
You can probably still hear me picking rappers from my teeth
I’m the last of the elite
I got money, fuck a friend
Got them goons on deck like pitchers in the bullpen
On them Lil Weezy Ana streets, nigga fuck where you been
On a scale of 1 to 10, shawty I’m a 10

[Sean Kingston]
Let's ride, and get high 

[x2]
We don't back down, I'm laying the smack down
I'm sorry but you're never gonna see me fall
We don't back down, we movin' in packs now
I'm sorry but you niggas don't scare me at all
We don't back down, we makin' them stacks now
I'm sorry but we're just gonna continue to ball
We don't back down, I'm stating the facts now
But you niggas never gonna see us fall
Let's ride, and get high 

[x2]

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Armed and dangerous
Ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed, no angel dust
Label us notorious
Thug-ass niggas that love to bust, it's strange to us
Y'all niggas be scramblin', gamblin'
Up in restaurants with mandolins and violins
We just sittin' here tryna win, try not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke, need oxygen
Steadily countin' them Benjamins
Nigga, you should too, if you knew
What this game'll do to you
Been in this shit since '92
Look at all the bullshit I been through
So-called beef with you-know-who
Fucked a few female stars or two
Then I blew like nigga move like Mike
Shit, not to be fucked with
Motherfucker better duck quick
'Cause me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game
Spit yo game, talk yo shit
Grab yo gat, call yo clique
Squeeze yo clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggas, I got to fight one
All them hoes, I got to like one
Our situation is a tight one
What you gonna do: fight or run?

It's Sean and Weezy, Weezy

[Intro]
Darling, my darling, my darling
I want to please you
Darling, my darling, my darling
I want to please you, oh!

[Verse 1]
I watch everything you say and do
And that's because I'm interested in you, oh
You may think that I pay you no mind
But I can see the hurt there in your eyes

[Pre Chorus]
How long can you keep on hiding
Wearing a smile that is upside down
You just look over your shoulder
I'll be around, oh!

[Chorus]
What you need most, I do best of all
You need love and it shows
You don't fool me at all

[Verse 2]
When your at home all by yourself
I bet you play games with yourself, (oh, why, why, why)
Like setting a table for two
Knowing that there be only just you

[Pre Chorus]
Life don't have to be that way
Once you realize what you need
And what you need now, darling, it just be, oh!

[Chorus]
What you need most, I do best of all
Honey, you need love and shows
You don't fool me at all

[Bridge]
Here I am, here I am with open arms, dear
Like your shadow, i've always been near
For I know just what you been through
'Cause I've walked that same road too

[Pre Chorus]
So, just make up your mind
What you're looking for ain't hard to find

[Chorus]
What you need
I do best of all
Honey, you need love and it shows
You don't fool me at all

What you need most (what'cha need girl, what'cha need girl)
I do best of all (what'cha need, what'cha need, what'cha need girl)
You need love and it shows (what'cha need girl, what'cha need girl)
You don't fool me at all (what'cha need, what'cha need, what'cha need girl)

[Outro]
Ooh! (darling, my darling, my darling. best of all)

[x13]
Yeah! Baby! (darling, my darling, my darling. best of all)
I know what'cha need and I'm right here to give it to you
Take my hand! 

[fade out]
Once upon a time
You filled my life and now you're gone
But life will go on
I find myself still holding on

To a dream that you'll come back
I can't accept that you have gone
(Whichever way I turn)
I still see you in my mind

I can't stand (I can't stand it)
Being all alone (i can't stand it)
You're my chosen one (I can't stand it)
Can't you see what you've done
You got my heart on the run

Oh baby, can't you see?
You can put your trust in me
I know that (I know, I know)
You'll find that hard to believe
When (when will I learn?)
That wanting love won't make love mine
Your love I've tried to earn
And though I've failed my heart still yearns
This emptiness my heart can't stand (baby)
Without your love, I'm half a man 'cause

(In bed) I toss and I turn
'Cause i need you in the night!

(Put your trust in me baby!)
Baby, baby!
(Put your trust in me baby)
I can't stand being alone!
(Put your trust in me baby)
Girl, I want you for my own!
(Put your trust in me baby)
Put your trust in me baby!

I can't stand being all alone
You're my chosen one
Can't you see what you've done
You got my heart on the one for you, baby
(Baby, can't you see?)
You can put all your trust in me (I got to say that)
I know (i know! I know!)
You'll find that hard to believe!
Baby! Baby!
(Put your trust in me baby)
Without you baby I can't go on!
(Put your trust in me baby)
I'll hold on to your love!
(Put your trust in me baby)
Put your trust in me baby!
(Put your trust in me)

Little girl, what am I gonna do?
I've realized I don't have you
(do, do, doo)
You are the girl that can make my life
You're the girl i want to make my wife
Put your trust in me baby!
Put your trust in me baby!
There ain't no limit to the things I wouldn't do
Trust in me like i trust in you!

(Put your trust in me baby)
I'm begging you baby!
(Put your trust in me baby)
I'm down on my bended knees!
(put your trust in me baby)

Tell me now, while I still got my pride left
I’ll walk away and ill leave you to yourself
Is there any- (is there any-?)
-body else? (-body else?)
Don't you keep it to yourself!

I feel a hurt coming on
When were together, I feel like I'm alone
Won’t you tell me if I'm right or if I'm wrong
Don't let me live like I just don't belong
No, no
Is there any- (Is there any-?)
Anybody else? (-body else?)
Don't you keep it to yourself
When we're sleeping here together
Baby you'll always call my name;

And things just ain’t the same!

Ba ba da ba da ba ba da
Ba ba da ba da ba ba da ba da ba ba da
Ba ba da ba da ba ba da ba da ba ba da
Ba ba da bow!
Ooh wow ooh wow oh!

When I look into your eyes
It's plain to see the doorway to your heart is closed for me
’Cause I know eyes don't lie
So why can't we just end this mystery?
Oh, baby
Is there any- (is there any-?)
Anybody else? (-body else?)
Don't you keep it to yourself

Ba ba da ba da ba ba da
Ba ba da ba da ba ba da ba da ba ba da

[Intro]
Thank you everybody for coming out
Listenin' to that Easy Mac
Shits for Pittsburgh, that 412
So light up your blunts
We got time for one more
Aight? Yeah
You at the back of the Mac

[Verse 1]
Yo, yo Easy Mac rap slick and sensational
Foolin' fools out they shoes like the first of April
I'm aimin' low, the words guaranteed to make em fold
I'll be remembered next December but your name'll go
My name remains, rhymes sent to your brain
Intentions disdained, these other cats resent and complain
My minds bettin' insane until the lyrics are complete
Spittin' fear in the ears of all those who compete
So I never skip a beat, the kid is Swisher Sweet
You can picture me cheesin' when my album hits the street
With the words too sick to speak, so I spit it in my sleep, fuck
Countin' sheep, I'm about to heat
Proving anybody wrong who was doubtin' me
They say, "Malcolm, please, get a new career"
It appears that they fear who I'll be in a year
Cause I'm creatin' racket, making tracks up in the attic
See my life changed after I heard Illmatic
It was drastic, automatic rappin' fantastic
I'm Jurassic, mic melts like plastic
I got the gift and you wish that you had it
So you study hip-hop and you read how to-do's
Thinkin' that it's helping but you learnin' how to lose
See I was— born gifted, live to get lifted
If rappin' ain't my life then what is it?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yo, yeah, yeah
Rhymes is my domes home, on a gold throne
Spittin' sick, burnin' holes in the o-zone
I rock clothes that don't fit me, flows that spit quickly
And rip cities, kickin' clouds that hit middies
Cause the Pitt's busy, I'm sorry— you just missed me
I can't bare what you spit cause its grizzly
I kick shit you can't spit, wit, nitwit, sick quick
And let me twist back my Pitt fit
The best yet, blessed to catch wreck
In fresh sweats with more words in less breaths
Your next guest with more swords for pressed pests
The rest sweat for wars and accept— (chyeah!)
I gotta passion for rappin'
I'm passin' up has-beens with passive reactions
You askin' for action? I'm clashin' up your atoms
Your ass'll get flattened, be askin' what happened

[Verse 3]
Yeah, look
I'm sleep deprived, but managin' to keep my mind
And when rest tries to find me, I seek to hide
Bleed from eyes, they been open for too long
My body needs sleep but these demons is too strong
My insomnia lets me spit a monologue
Stayin' up writing as the night is going on and on
Out my mind, I'm a maniac insane with rap
Raises, now my brain describes players playin' haters act
Traitors need to watch they back, cause I know just where they at
Scared of rap, be where I'm at
Lookin' and I'm starin' back'
Hatin' , say ya prayers
And that Pittsburgh is where I'm at
We true hip-hop, we the rarest cats

[Outro]
Yeah, it's Easy Mac
Mackin' ain't easy
Get at me, yo
Pittsburgh, where you at?
Stand up

[Spoken]
Hey, baby
How you feel? (ooh)
If you ever need someone
To call on, remember baby
I'll be there

[Verse 1]
Don't give up cause he hurt you
Try my love, I won't desert you
Let me (let me)
Mend the tear in your heart baby
(...) take away the sorrow
What I got will give you hope for tomorrow
Let me (let me)
Just give my love a try (ah!)

[Pre Chorus]
(ah! ooh!) If you think all hope is gone
I guarantee you're wrong
I'm standing here with my arms open wide
So come on in from the rain outside

[Chorus]
Because I'll take you in, yeah
And I'll be your friend, yeah, yeah
Don't you know that I'll take you in
And give you a home

[Verse 2]
I'll smother you, 'till you can't breathe
With the kind of love that you need
Let me (let me)
Let me in your life, baby, baby, baby
I'll give you all my loving
Every bit of my kissing and hugging
Let me (let me)
Just give my love a try

[Pre Chorus]
(ah! ooh!)
If you think you've had enough
Wait until you've had my love
I'll comfort you and I'll treat you right
Come on in, out of the night, girl

[Chorus]
'Cause I'll take you in
Just trust in me girl
I'll be your friend
No more more misery
'Cause I'll, I'll take you in, girl, girl
And give you a home, baby
(And give you a home) give you a piece of love
(And give you a home) make you a part of my masterplan
I want you to know that
I'll take you in (oh!)
And give you a home

(And give you a home) I'll be good to you, baby
(And give you a home) I'll take you in girl
(And give you a home) I'll be good to you lady
(And give you a home) I'll be your very best friend
(And give you a home) Ah!
(And give you a home) I'll take you, I'll take you
(And give you a home) And I'll, i'll take you home baby, yeah
(And give you a home) When you call...
(And give you a home) When you call!
(And give you a home) I'll give you a home, I'll take you in
(And give you a home)

Don't walk away
(ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Can't you see, I love you baby
I'll... take you in
I'll... take you in
I'll... baby
I'll take you in
(I'll take you, I'll take you in)
(ill be your, I'll be your friend) let me be your gentle friend, ah!

(ill be your, I'll be your friend)

[fade out]

[Verse 1: The D.O.C.]
I came in this bitch on some Norman Bates shit
But now I'm tryna get to Bill Gates, bitch
With laptops, be stockin' your Feds
When them hoes got shipped, I got a check
You know the rest
We in the set, ridin' deep in the stretch
We drinking on that Patrón, no tops on the guests
And as I like sex with someone fuckin' in my new Hummer
And ain't no 

[?] to the numbers on my checks
Rag top phantom by that CR 

[?]

[?] tell by the doctor in the 

[?]
Ain't nothin' outta my hands
I don't need financin' for heliports, so I can just land down in the canyon
At the mansion, your nigga expandin'
Nigga, you know the ran, I blow green like sweets
'Cause see, I came from the streets
But niggas hustle to eat
Now I fly to get the paper, slangin' motherfuckin' beats get-

[Chorus: Dr. Dre]
Pow!
Guns blaze when I shine
Make a wish quick, no star and I'm the shooting kind
Pow!
Front page all the time
You boys think sick, but I ain't got no roof on mine
I dream topless, I live topless
Like my girl is the game with her titties out
I dream topless, I live topless
Sky is the limit, I'm paid to run the city now (City now, city now)

[Verse 2: Slim the Mobster]
I cruise the block in a convertible car
I come from where the murders are
Survive through the murderous odds
Some niggas' mysteries are murders unsolved
And I can take you outcha misery, no problem at all
Shit, I was born to ball and get money like the big boys do
So make way and let the big boy through
Part of me 

[?]
These numbers is startlin'
Aftermath to the 

[?]
I'm unruly and disorderly like I oughtta be
Who gives a fuck what you niggas thought of me
Thought I'd be finished by now, huh?
I'm just get riled up
Order up another round up
The last heir to the throne, so go on and shine the crown up
For these California niggas, my flow napalm
Six more words than they arms
With more juice than Barry Bonds
Amongst niggas with attitudes, consider me ruthless
Yeah, there ain't no stopping me
It's back to robberies

[Chorus: Dr. Dre]
Pow!
Guns blaze when I shine
Make a wish quick, no star and I'm the shooting kind
Pow!
Front page all the time
You boys think sick, but I ain't got no roof on mine
I dream topless, I live topless
Like my girl is the game with her titties out
I dream topless, I live topless
Sky is the limit, I'm paid to run the city now (City now, city now, city now)

[Verse 1]
Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You got me feeling diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?

[Pre-Chorus]
Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?

[Chorus]
All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on
Let's get physical

[Verse 2]
Adrenaline keeps on rushing in
Love the simulation we're dreaming in
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
I don't wanna live another life
'Cause this one's pretty nice
Living it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?

[Verse 1]
Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Drop]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Drop]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Drop]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
(Don't, don't, don't)

[Drop]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Don't show up (Don't show up), don't come out (Don't come out)
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now)
Walk away (Walk away), you know how (You know how)
Don't start caring about me now (So)

Bustin down bricks with my hand call it judo
My mama side red but my daddy side blue though
Pull up I'm flexin' ye I made it rang

Grind through the city and I feel like this my year

She hop in the shower , we fuck for an hour

Cowards, flexin' big dump trucks on
Parelies and fagiatos so to settle
You pussy niggas ain't really ready

Tone canes with them things
Throw some clips you know ain't never
Soulja tell 'em I flex , Gucci on my rims
Next year I'm outta here I'm flexin with the 10

Steady getting money cause the money in the way


No, I can't see em – no, no
Tell my haters I can't see em – no
Money in the way cause Soulja Boy get the cash
Pull up to the club, got bands on bands on bands
Tell them haters that I can't see em – no

Money and that cash got me fresh from head to toe
I step inside the club and they already know

Tell my haters that the money in the way and I got swag
Pull up to the club, wrist so fresh with all these bands
Leaning, no kids staring and I popped a couple Xans

Haters hatin on me cause Soulja Boy getting that cake
But I can't see em, I can't see em
The money in the way

And that money in the way so I can't see em, man them racks (racks)

No, I can't see em – no, no
The money in the way, they say Soulja Boy party
He flexin, he got them racks
Stacks on stacks and bags keep stabbing up in er back

Soulja pull up flexin, he stuntin, he got the racks
No, I can't see em, look at my hater's face

[Instrumental]

[Refrain: Prince]
Scandalous
Marvelous

[Spoken: Prince and Kim Basinger]
Where am I?
Where do you wanna be?
Right here, right here

[Chorus: Prince]
Scandalous
I'm talking about you and me
Marvelous
Baby, baby, can't you see
Anything you've ever dreamed of
I'm willing to be
Tonight it's going to be scandalous
'Cause tonight I'm going to be your fantasy

[Outro: Prince]
Scandalous
Marvelous
Scandalous

[Stanza 1]
Stay on your path Sylvia Plath
don't fall away like all the others

[Stanza 2]
Don't take all your secrets alone to your watery grave about
lovers and -

[Stanza 3]
The secrets you keep will keep you in deep like Amy and -
And brother
And all of the people you meet on the street will reiterate lies
that they uttered

[Stanza 4]
Leave me in peace, I cry
In the middle of the night
On a slow boat bound for Catalina for no reason

[Stanza 5]
Tiny drops of perspiration dot my forehead
could be mistaken for dew drops if this were photo season

[Stanza 6]
But alas this is a real life - and it's been a real fight just to
stop my mind from committing treason
Why you ask?
Because she told the townspeople I was crazy, and the lies, they
started to believe them

[Stanza 7]
But anyways - that's all over now

[Stanza 8]
I've moved on, gone scorched earth
And now I'm left wondering where to go from here
To Sonoma where the fires have just left?
South Dakota?

[Stanza 9]
Would standing in front of Mount Rushmore feel like the Great
American homecoming I never had?

[Stanza 10]
Would the magnitude of the scale of the sculptures take the place
of the warm embrace I've never got

[Stanzza 11]
Or should I just be here now
Bare feet on linoleum
Slicing vegetables onto water that I will later turn
into stew

[Stanzza 12]
People love my stories
People love visions

[Stanza 1]
I went to a party
I came in hot
Made decisions beforehand
My mind made up
Things that would make me happy
To do them or not
Each option weighed carefully
A plan for each thought
And then I walked through the door past the open concept
And saw Violet bent backwards over the grass
Seven years old with dandelions grasped tightly in her hand
Arched like a bridge in a fallen handstand
Grinning wildly like a madman
With the exuberance that only doing nothing can bring
Waiting for the fireworks to begin
And in that moment I decided to do nothing about everything

[Stanza 1]
Two blue steel trains run through the tunnels of your cool blue steel eyes
Vernon
Rock quarry
The vastness of which has nothing on your beautiful mind
Dylan
i hear Dylan when I look at you
i can see it in invisible ink like a tattoo
The ying to my yang
the toughness to my unending softness
A striking example of masculinity
firm in your verticality
sure in your confrontation against all elements
and duality
The sun to my wilting daisy
The earth to the wildflower that doesn't care where it grows

Vernon
everything's burnt here
there's no escaping it
the air is fried and on fire
I've never really fallen in love
but whatever this feeling is
i wish everyone could experience it
this place feels like a person
familiar
like someone i've stood next to before
but never while I was standing next to you
Thank you
for being here
for bearing witness to my vastness
Through the year I've called you in and out of my orbit
You, in your madness
the satellite that constellates my world
mimicking the inner chaos that I've disowned
a mirror to my past life retributions
and a reflection of my sadness
If I'm going to keep on living the way that I'm living
i can't do it without you
My feet aren't on the ground
i need your body to stand on
your name to define me
on top of being a woman
i am scared
and
ethereal
And

[Stanza 4]
There are seven worlds in my eyes

[Stanza 5]
I'm accessing of all them once

[Stanza 6]
One to draw my words from and my muses
Another one I try and harness late at night that lies somewhere
off of the right of Jupiter
And then of course there's this one I live in
The land of a thousand fires
That's where you come in

[Stanza 7]
You
Vernon
Dylan
Two blue steel trains running through the tunnels of your cool blue steel eyes

[Stanza 8]
To guide me far from the world of my early days
That I cant quite make out clearly
That beckon me towards high sea cliffs
On long car rides

[Stanza 9]
Towards a future place
A world unknown to me
Made up of something surreal and dripping
Flowers in solar systems oversized

[Stanza 10]
You Vernon Dylan

[Stanza 11]
No words needed to sponge up the dark nights
No explanations for the globes in my eyes
Shoulder to shoulder in the factory light
Letting me be who I would have been if everything had turned out alright

[Stanza 12]
Three alternative endings
Now course through my blood on ice
But I thrive because I say I do
And because it's what I write

[Stanza 13]
But honestly if you weren't here with me
I don't know what things would look like

[Stanza 14]
That's my why no matter what world I'm in
I'm accessible by only one satellite
Vernon
Dylan
And you in your madness

[Stanza 15]
With two blue steel trains running through your cool blue steel eyes

[Stanza 1]
I saw you in the mirror
You were wearing your hair differently
Carrying the air differently
You said you wear your hair long parted in the middle
Long in solidarity just like all his women

[Stanza 2]
In Long Beach

[Stanza 3]
Aimless

[Stanza 4]
Your fingers wiping oil on the paper with precision
With decision like an artist never seen yet with a vision

[Stanza 5]
With a reason
Stared with venom at the ceiling
Not the grass
But straight ahead
Just at the skyline
With precision
Laser vision

[Stanza 6]
Time was stopping
Moving through you
You dictated
by what moved you

[Stanza 7]
Only moving, never thinking

[Stanza 8]
Match to the sun that’s slowly sinking
At the height of the afternoon
In the heat of the summer evening
Like a phoenix, like a chem trail, like a wavelength no one’s claiming

[Stanza 9]
Georgia o Keefe
Georgia peaches
Doing nothing but your painting
For forever
Forget teachers
Forgive him for ever leaving

[Stanza 10]
Love is rising
No resisting
Cheeks are flushing
Now you’re living

[Stanza 11]
Say goodbye now
No resisting
Live your life like
No one's listening

[Stanza 12]
Be the art the life is breathing
Be the soul the world is living

[Stanza 13]
For you only
Not for giving
Just for taking
No one's listening

[Stanza 14]
At the end of Rose and Rich
Down the street that’s green and winding
Past the bushes cypress thriving
Past the chain link fence and driving
Further down the road less travelled
There you are athleisure wear unraveled
Now I see you clear

[Stanza 15]
Standing stoic blue and denim
Eyes not blue but clear like heaven

[Stanza 16]
You don’t want to be forgotten

[Stanza 17]
You just want to disappear

[Verse 1]
Got my headlights off, we're sittin' outside
If you climb in my car, then we're here all night, ooh
A couple blunts rolled and I got my windows down
Shorty, it's been a while since you've been this high

[Pre-Chorus]
If you're waitin' on love, then you waitin' for a while
If your neighbors wake up, then we gotta turn it down
So you say I'm the type you like keepin' around
You like keepin' around

[Chorus]
Late at night, eleven, we're cruisin'
Lately, I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?
Late at night, eleven, we're crusin'
Lately, I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?

[Verse 2]
21s sittin' on my M5 (Yeah)
Ride around summer, all-wheel-drive, yeah
Couple blunts in and I got my windows down
Lookin' real nice in my passenger side

[Pre-Chorus]
If you're waitin' on love, then you waitin' for a while
If your neighbors wake up, then we gotta turn it down
So you say I'm the type you like keepin' around
You like keepin' around

[Chorus]
Late at night, eleven, we're cruisin'
Lately, I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?
Late at night, eleven, we're cruisin'
Lately, I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?

[Bridge]
Ooh, don't you forget about me
Ooh, don't you forget about me
Ooh, don't you forget about me
Ooh, don't forget about me
Ooh, don't you forget about me
Ooh, don't forget about me, yeah
Ooh, don't you forget about me
Ooh, don't you forget about me

[Chorus]
Late at night, eleven, we're cruisin'
(Lately, I've been watchin' your, watchin' your)
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?

[Outro]
Don't you forget about me
If I'm the only one that you're
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin', usin'?
If I'm the only one that you're
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin', usin'?
Don't you forget about me
If I'm the only one that you're
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin', usin'?
If I'm the only one that you're
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin', usin'?

[Verse 1]
I come from a small town, how 'bout you?
I only mention it 'cause I'm ready to leave LA
And I want you to come
Eighty miles north or south will do
I don't care where as long as you're with me
And I'm with you and you let me

[Chorus]
Let me love you like a woman
Let me hold you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be who I'm meant to be
Talk to me in poems and songs
Don't make me be bittersweet
Let me love you like a woman
Let me hold you like a baby
Let me hold you like a baby

[Verse 2]
I come from a small town far away
I only mention it 'cause I'm ready to leave LA
And I want you to come (And I need you to come)
I guess I could manage if you stay
It's just if you do, I can't see myself having any fun, so

[Chorus]
Let me love you like a woman
Let me hold you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be who I'm meant to be
Talk to me in songs and poems
Don't make me be bittersweet
Let me love you like a woman

[Post-Chorus]
Take you to infinity
Let me love you like a woman (Let me hold you like a baby)
Take you to infinity
Let me love you like a woman (Let me hold you like a baby)
Take you to infinity

[Bridge]
We could get lost in the purple rain
Talk about the good ol' days
We could get high on some pink champagne
Baby, let me count the ways

[Chorus]
Let me love you like a woman
Let me hold you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be who I'm meant to be
Talk to me in songs and poems
Don't make me be bittersweet
Let me love you like a woman

[intro]
Yeah, ayy, brrr
Yeah, yeah, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Under the moonlight
He said he felt the mood right
And said, "Is everything right?"
We drunk up off that moonshine, yeah
We look up at the star lights
You look just like the star shine
I gave it a boy my sunshine
It's peakin' through the highrise
I'm peakin' that like (whoa)
But it don't mean shit if you ain't happy, though
Happiness is all that matters, yes I hope you know
And fuck it, let's just see what happens, take a risk, let's take a trip
And so I vrooma vrooma, hope we don't hit the dip

[Verse 1]
White Mercedes, whip it
Watch me strippin', press up on the glass
Do it good, I'm on the dash
Put you right up on the dash
I be on my Al Pacino level, high as fuck today
Robbery, if you break my heart, you better run away
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Yeah, under the moonlight
He said he felt the mood right
And said, "Is everything right?"
We drunk up off that moonshine, yeah
We look up at the star lights
You look just like the star shine
I gave it a boy my sunshine
It's peakin' through the highrise
I'm peakin' that like (whoa)
But it don't mean shit if you ain't happy, though
Happiness is all that matters, yes I hope you know
And fuck it, let's just see what happens, take a risk, let's take a trip
And so I vrooma vrooma, hope we don't hit the dip

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, Marilyn Monroe shit
Blow you away, blow you away, like you alive shit
Wear a white dress, rip it off, lay me down in the grass shit
Fuckin' it up good, 4 AM, swimming pool after dark shit
Summer nights, Pacific Highway
'Cause I just really wanna pull you close
Always love the things I lose the most
Oh, oh, oh
Fall in love and then we let it go
Always love the things I lose the most, yeah
Hop in the ride, ruh ruh

It's a girls' night out
Let's have a girls' night out tonight
It's a girls' night out
Let's have a girls' night out tonight

[Verse 3: Ty.Ni]
Come on Charli, let's go party
Kiss the boys and make them cry

[Chorus]

(Chorus)Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me

(Verse 1)Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
Jail bars ain't golden gates
Those who fake, they break
When they meet their 400-pound mate
If I could rule the world
Everyone would have a gun in the ghetto of course
When giddyup n on their horse
I kick a rhyme drinking moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete, for the deceased
But no don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
Thinking bout the robbery that I did last week
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A Born Again hooligan only to be king again
(Chorus)Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me

(Verse 2)I play my enemies like a game of chess, where I rest
No stress, if you don't smoke sess, lest
I must confess, my destiny's manifest
In some Gore Tex and sweats I make treks like I'm homeless
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty like Elliot Ness, yes
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew
If you're doo-doo, voodoo
I can do what you do, easy, believe me
Fronting niggas give me hee-bee-gee-bees
So while you're imitating Al Capone, I'll be Nina Simone
And defecating on your microphone
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
You can't run away
From these styles I got, oh baby, hey baby
Cause I got a lot, oh yeah
And anywhere you go
My whole crew's gonna know baby, hey baby
You can't hide from the block, oh no
Ready or not, refugees taking over
The Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock Rasta
On the twelfth hour, fly by in my bomber
Crews run for cover, now they're under pushing up flowers
Superfly true lies, do or die
Toss me high ? only puff la
With my crew from lock high
I refugee from Guantanamo Bay
Dance around the border like I'm Cassius Clay

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
She was walking in the street, looked up and noticed
He was nameless, he was homeless
She asked him his name and told him what hers was
He gave her a story 'bout life
With a glint in his eye and a corner of a smile
One conversation, a simple moment
The things that change us if we notice
When we look up sometimes

[Pre-Chorus]
They said I would never make it
But I was built to break the mold
The only dream that I've been chasing is my own

[Chorus]
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
Single mothers waiting on a check to come
Young teachers, student doctors
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run
This goes out to the underdog
Keep on keeping at what you love
You'll find that someday soon enough
You will rise up, rise up, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
She's riding in a taxi back to the kitchen
Talking to the driver 'bout his wife and his children
On the run from a country where they put you in prison
For being a woman and speaking your mind
She looked in his eyes in the mirror and he smiled
One conversation, a single moment
The things that change us if we notice
When we look up sometimes

[Pre-Chorus]
They said I would never make it
But I was built to break the mold
The only dream that I've been chasing is my own

[Chorus]
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
Single mothers waiting on a check to come
Young teachers, student doctors
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run
This goes out to the underdog
Keep on keeping at what you love
You'll find that someday soon enough
You will rise up, rise up, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Bridge]
Everybody rise up
You gonna rise up, ayy

[Chorus]
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
Single mothers waiting on a check to come (Say you're gonna make it)
Young teachers, student doctors (Yeah)
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run
This goes out to the underdog
Keep on keeping at what you love
You'll find that someday soon enough
You will rise up, rise up, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, here we go now, here we go now
Three-sixty on a merry-go-round, merry-go-round
Ooh, baby, baby, here we go now, here we go now
Three-sixty on a merry-go-round, on a merry-go-round

[Post-Chorus]

You know I see you lookin' at, lookin' at, lookin' at, lookin' at me, me

[Verse 1]
Let me take you to the places that you won't go (Won't go), yeah
And let me tell you what you don't know (Don't know), yeah
And you've been ridin' solo (Solo)
And I've been tryna tell you that you should come away with me
To the top floor (Top floor)
'Cause you've been workin' way too hard for (Hard for)
You to be unhappy, every day I put a smile on your face
'Cause that's the way that it should be (Should be)

[Bridge]
I take my time with you
This moment could last forever
What's been on your mind?
For you upon the sky
And give it to you
I made this life with you
I hold you, we close together
There's no compromise
We stay lost in time

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, here we go now, here we go now
Three-sixty on a merry-go-round, merry-go-round
Ooh, baby, baby, here we go now, here we go now
Three-sixty on a merry-go-round, on a merry-go-round

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, you see me lookin' at, lookin' at, lookin' at, lookin' at you
I know you see me lookin' at, lookin' at, lookin' at, lookin' at you
Yeah, yeah, I see you lookin' at, lookin' at, lookin' at, lookin' at me, me
You know I see you lookin' at, lookin' at, lookin' at, lookin' at me, me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Well, I take your momma to dinner, I take your sister to lunch
I was so happy to meet her, the bill, I'm pickin' it up
I drove you round in the Beamer, we take a trip for the month
And every time that I see your pussy, I'm beatin' it up
You leavin' me stuck, so all you do, keep-keepin' it up
I'm leavin' for work, I swear that I don't see you enough
And can you tell me 'bout your dreams, what you believe in and stuff?
I was waitin' for a "We," like, "When are we gonna fuck?", yeah

[Outro]
I take my time with you, forever
There's nothin' we can't do together, whoa-oh-oh
The queen
You could be my queen
My queen
Ya

[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah (30, you a motherfuckin' fool, nigga)

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I left out of school without momma's permission
They wanted me dead, they be hoping and wishing
I'm still in your bags when I'm put in position
I'm dressed in all white like a chef in the kitchen
Lil Sada boat baby, I rock then I work
All these Ks but I still would have joined the navy
Remember that shoot-out in my red Vans
Had to duck, loaded the bullet almost grazed me
I stand but now I'm the type of nigga
That aim so right, when I shoot I ain't gotta dump
Twelve o'clock in the whip looking for the trunk
And you can’t fake the funk
Pistol attached to a nigga like breast lumps
Lot on the black pump
Pumping on tank three
Three in the morning, I'm half sleep

[Verse 2: Sada Baby]
And nigga I'm half woke
Still aware enough to tell your bitch I'm an asshole
I'm worried 'bout cash flow, income, and getting the bag though
I'm through the back door with my main bitch
Can't get caught with my side ho
I got Bape on, Baby Milo
Bring the bricks on the high low
This bitch only 5'4" but her throat feel like it's seven feet deep
She sucking dick with a blindfold
Made me disappear like my weed
I'm going in, bitch, its guaranteed
Left my momma house at seventeen
Met my first opp on Evergreen
He got dropped with guns he never seen
Had murder on my mind then, free YNW Melly
I don't know why you hating on me
Give me a reason to leave the Drac' on E
Got this bitch cooking steak for me
In the 'Rari running from the state police
Chopper hold a hundred, say the least
Lil nigga bout to die so say your peace
I know I gotta stay low-key
My granny said she pray for me
She know I keep a K on me
I was waiting on a nigga to play with me
Bitch I'm a lover and a fighter
Keep two sticks on me like striker
Custom vests, I ain't no biker
She could stay the night if I invite her

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
488, yeah the Spider
Red and yellow like I'm Rowdy Piper
Give a damn if shorty got a nigga
If the bitch is going, I'ma pipe her
Choppa 'round my belt like eight numbers
Eight numbers like I was at Rikers
Pistol snug like it's in a diaper
Bitch with me got Balmain like a biker
Bitch, what I want is hard to decipher
In a cypher most these niggas liars
Austin Power groovy, Michael Myers
Kill 'em off like Chris in Stomp the Yard
This lil' bitch right here, she got me hard
She just want the last four  to my card
Drop her off right there on boulevard
Fucked her once and left the baby scarred

[Verse 4: Saba Baby]
She was wearing Fendi leotards
I been cooking, whipping
Leonard DiCaprio, this white boy a star
Trapping out the house and in the car
I just served your spouse up at the bar
And you told like the mouse you are
Watch your mouth, you snitching from afar
Make no sense, you niggas work with law

[Verse 5: Lil Yachty]
Make no sense, you niggas need address
Left the nest, the team is still correct
Collect the bag, the bag I will collect
I'm the richer man, I won't contest
I'm the better rapper, I confess
Fucked her, now she setting up the desk
Fuck her, now she organize my clothes
Niggas mad I'm sending lower blows
Niggas mad I'm fucking better hoes
I'm a G, sucking ne’er toe
But I flipped the pussy like some dough
Freckles on her face like dominos

[Outro]
(30, you a motherfuckin' fool, nigga)

Talk, let's have conversations in the dark
World is sleeping, I'm awake with you, with you
Watch movies that we've both already seen
I ain't even looking at the screen
It's true, I got my eyes on you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you say that you're not worthy
You get hung up on your flaws
Well, in my eyes, you are perfect as you are

[Chorus]
I won't ever try to change you, change you
I will always want the same you, same you
Swear on everything I pray to
That I won't break your heart
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me
And your love is all you owe me
And I won't break your heart

[Verse 2]
On Sunday mornings we sleep in 'til noon
Oh, I could sleep forever next to you, next to you
And we, we got places we both gotta be
But there ain't nothing I would rather do
Than blow off all my plans for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you say that you're not worthy
And get hung up on your flaws
But in my eyes, you are perfect as you are
As you are

Swear on everything I pray to

Keep the secrets that you told me, told me
And your love is all you owe me
And I won't break your heart

[Verse 1]
Outside is cloudy, but I like that better (Better, better)
Behind the wheel, but still ain't on my way
Some people say they want to live forever
That's way too long, I'll just get through today

[Chorus]
Without any complications (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Does it always gotta, does it always gotta
Gotta be so complicated? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Well, I'm way too young to be gettin' old

And all I wanna do is look, but I can't see, baby
Who you talkin' to while you talkin' to me, baby?
Let me, let me know if I can see you later
We could make it easy

[Verse 3]
Inside my head is getting pretty cluttered (Cluttered, cluttered)
I try, but can't clean up this mess I made
'Fore I start to think about the future
First, can I please get through a day?

Well, I'm way too young to be gettin' old

[Intro]
It's a blue world without you
It's a blue world alone

[Chorus]
Yeah, well, this a mad world, it made me crazy
Might just turn around, do one-eighty
I ain't politickin', I ain't kissin' no babies
The devil on my doorstep bein' so shady
Mmm, don't trip, we don't gotta let him in
Don't trip
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I let it go
But I never go with it, mhm, yeah

[Verse 1]
Okay, cool as fall weather, fuck your bullshit
I'm here to make it all better with a little music for you
I don't do enough for you
Without you, it's the color blue, ooh, don't trip
I was in the city, they was talkin' that shit
Had the homies with me, all a sudden, they split
We ain't even worried, we just laughin', that's rich
You know how it goes, it ain't broke, don't fix

[Refrain]
Hey, one of these days
We'll all get by
Don't be afraid
Don't fall

[Verse 2]
Think I lost my mind
Reality's so hard to find
When the devil tryna call your line, but shit, I always shine
Even when the light dim
No, I ain't God, but I'm feelin' just like Him, ooh, don't trip
See, I was in the whip, ridin', me and my bitch
We was listenin' to us, no one else, that's it
That's a flex, just a bit, let me talk my shit
Say my head got big, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah
Well, this a mad world, it made me crazy
Might just turn around, do one-eighty
I ain't politickin', I ain't kissin' no babies
The devil on my doorstep bein' so shady

Don't trip

Well, this a mad world, it made me crazy
Might just turn around, do one-eighty
I ain't politickin', I ain't kissin' no babies
The devil on my doorstep bein' so shady
Mmm, don't trip, we don't gotta let him in
Don't trip
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I let it go
But I never go with it, uh

[Refrain]
Hey, one of these days
We'll all get by
Don't be afraid
Don't fall in line

[Verse 1]
I'm so close, I can taste it
The man on the moon keep playin'
Practical jokes, plantin' the mirrors and smoke that I fade away in
You be complainin', and I can't explain it, I guess
Nothin' compare to the feelin', the feelin' amazin'
Now I'm switchin' location
'Cause heaven too far when you live in the basement
I'm lookin' for balance, I'm in an oasis
Well, I need somebody to save me, hmm
Before I drive myself crazy

[Chorus]
And all I know
If life is but a dream, then so are we
Show me somethin', show me somethin', show me somethin'
And all I know
If life is but a dream, then so are we
Show me somethin', show me somethin', somethin' I can see

[Verse 2]
Yeah, don't tell me to stop
Let me keep goin' until I cannot
Life is a fantasy until you wake up in shock
Hittin' the ground, I'm hittin' the ground, I fell from the top
You never expect to drop, so hold on, but
That's just the way it goes, your god don't wait for no one
And when that's all you know, it keep you on your toes
You got so far to go, but look at where you came from

[Chorus]
And all I know
If life is but a dream, then so are we
Show me somethin', show me somethin', show me somethin'
And all I know
If life is but a dream, then so are we
Show me somethin', show me somethin', somethin' I can see

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, things like this ain't built to last
I might just fade like those before me
When will you forget my past?
Got questions, ask, you know the stories
And you need to let me know
When you're leaving, where you go
Can I come?
Do you believe me, are you close?
Yeah, even if you don't
That'll get you sprung

[Chorus]
Do I, do I, do I love?
Can I, can I, can I get enough?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, don't run away, love
Hate love, heartbreak will have you bankrupt
Too many days in a daze, better wake up
I put your face in a place where the space was
Nobody makes you feel like you but (Do I?)
And you don't know what you should do
You just lookin' for someone to make you move, ooh, tell me (Do I?)
I make this planet feel like home
It's us versus time, the door is closing
So far beyond all our control
You saved a soul so close to broken
It's so much better when you wait
Forever and a day, that's all I got
Put it together then it break
All the energy it take, it never stop

[Chorus]
Do I, do I, do I love?
Can I, can I, can I get enough?

[Bridge]
Yeah, I never slip, I never fall
I tried to tell you 'bout a better life
And get involved big or small
It's been my fault, I keep it safe, it's in the vault
Blindfolded, keep it going 'til we hit a wall, yeah
I'm never going through the motions
I'm just tryna lay your body down slowly
We can only go up
We can only go up

[Chorus]
Do I, do I, do I love?
Can I, can I, can I get enough?

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I'm thinkin' maybe I should thank you
Oh, baby, I should buy you another round
'Cause you care, and I swear that I'm here, but I'm there
It's gettin' harder to hunt me down
Get away to a place with a lake, such a great view
Leave the bank, couple hunnid thou'
I made it, but I hate once I build it, I break it
That might just break me down

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
And all I ever needed was somebody with some reason who can keep me sane
Ever since I can remember, I've been keepin' it together, but I'm feelin' strange
Get away when it ain't really safe and it don't seem right
But what's new? You get used to the bullshit, the screws, they go missin'
It's likely they might be, but...

[Chorus: Baro Sura]
You remind me
Shit, I need to stay in line
You damn well are a great design
You, despite bein' an only child
Say you need more of a family 'round
Let's turn these genes into hand me downs

[Post-Chorus: Baro Sura]
Down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down
Down, down, down

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, well, I'm just being honest, my conscience ain't doin' bad
Because I try to minus the problems that I attract
And half the time, the wheels that's in the back of my mind
Just keep on turnin' 'til the tires flat and burn until the fire crack
I do not lie, though, facts may seem a little farfetched
That's only 'cause I may be make-believe and full of darkness
When I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place
Walkin', droppin' change inside your empty guitar case
That's charity, um, I move carelessly, that's why I'm always trippin'
I guess it's like electrolytes, you help me go the distance
Not too efficient, but the way it's always been
Until the day we have to meet again

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
Get away when it ain't really safe and it don't seem right
But what's new? You get used to the bullshit, the screws, they go missin'
It's likely they might be, but...

[Chorus: Baro Sura]
You remind me
Shit, I need to stay in line
You damn well are a great design
You, despite bein' an only child
Say you need more of a family 'round
Let's turn these genes into hand me downs

[Post-Chorus: Baro Sura]
Down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down
Down, down, down

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, why don't you wake up from your bad dreams?
When's the last time you took a little time for yourself?
There's no reason to be so down
Rather fly around like there's no ground
And I, I bet you wish you hadn't ate
'Cause carrying this weight'll break your glass knees
Yeah, don't need no chauffeur, fuck the backseat
No, I stay behind the wheel and never half-speed

[Verse]
Get the fuck out of my car, this ain't a taxi
They love to see me lonely, hate to see me happy
Call me what you want, she call me "daddy"
Got a knack for gettin' nasty, every day we keepin' tally, yeah
Ooh, it's true I want it badly
Hit the zoom, I be movin' like a athlete
(Now concentrate) No reason to be that upset
I'm busy trippin' 'bout some shit that still ain't even happen yet
I keep it honest as honesty gets
Don't know why I'm always talkin' if I'm not makin' sense
I've spent my life livin' with a lot of regrets
You throw me off my high horse, I'd probably fall to my death
(Bad behavior) It's obvious you're not on your best
I might just pull your card if it's on top of the deck
Give me, give me what I need and then I'm onto the next
That's what we callin' cause and effect

[Chorus]
Yeah, why don't you wake up from your bad dreams?
When's the last time you took a little time for yourself?
There's no reason to be so down
Rather fly around like there's no ground
And I, I bet you wish you hadn't ate
'Cause carrying this weight'll break your glass knees
Yeah, don't need no chauffeur, fuck the backseat
No, I stay behind the wheel and never half-speed

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey
Said

[Verse 1]
Where are you goin'? Can I come too?
The whole world is open, a playground for me and you
And we could be fine, shit, who the hell knows?
It's your eyes and your ears and your mouth and your nose
Head and your shoulders, your knees and your toes
I dream of this moment
Will it come true?
The whole world, they know it
They just waitin' for me and you
And she, just like I
Got her head in the clouds
Don't need to be lower
Before it's all over, I promise we'll figure it out
I ain't comin' down
Why would I need to?
So much of this world is above us, baby
They might tell you that I went crazy
I'm just tryna read you
Ooh, ooh, oohh
Ooh-ooh-oohh

[Chorus]
I know we try
And the days, they go by
Until we get old
There's water in the flowers, let's grow
People, they lie
But hey, so do I
Until it gets old
There's water in the flowers, let's grow

[Post-Chorus]
Let it go, let it be
We're all we need today
Let it go, let it be
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

[Verse 2]
Yeah, well
Sometimes I get lonely
Not when I'm alone
But it's more when I'm standin' in crowds
That I'm feelin' the most on my own
And I know that somebody knows me
I know somewhere there's home
I'm startin' to see that all I have to do is get up and go

[Bridge]
Goin', goin', goin' before I'm gone
Gotta get goin', goin', goin' before I'm gone

[Chorus]
Ayy, and I know we try
Days, they go by
Until we get old
There's water in the flowers, let's grow
People, they lie
But hey, so do I
Until it gets old
There's water in the flowers, let's grow

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
To be honest lately I ain't been workin' (Yeah)
I've been layin' 'round like your everyday person (Yep)
Homie, I've been chillin' (Chillin')
Tryin' stay grounded (Grounded)
Made too much money, ain't even got the time to count it (No prob)
Yeah, and I ain't here to cry about my problems
I ain't here to act like I don't got options (No)

[Chorus]
Is life really that bad?
Is life really that bad?
Is your life really that bad? (Woo)
(Stop complainin')
Is your life really that bad? (Woo)
(Yeah, every day we survive, mane)
Is your life really that bad? (Hell no)
(Keep waitin', but they'll never stop hatin' on ya)
Yeah, if it is, lemme know (Yeah)
Gotta get up off your ass, everybody gotta go

[Verse 1]
Yeah, the infinite bullshit, it doesn't end (No)
I'm amongst my friends, swagger on a hundred-ten (Woo)
It's feelin' like, fallin' in love again
I made that money, money—musta learned somethin' then (Well)
Not really, no—I don't give a fuck again
Bottom of the ninth inning, bring the closer from the pen (Shut it down)
Pittsburgh soldier, see, the war's never over
Wake 'em up like Folgers, thought I motherfuckin' told ya
I'm the faces on the poster in your sister's room
While she doin' homework, probably sniffin' glue
Reason that she missin' school
Parents disapprove of the lyrical content (Shit)
Wish I focused I more on the issues, less material objects (Goddamn)
My spiritual conscious is delirious often
Went from always livin' life to disappeared in a coffin
I'm a vampire, zombie child
All the walls fallin' down
Didn't pay attention to me? You don't have an option now
Karma brought the commas round
Line 'em up and knock 'em down
Bitch, I've been the hottest out
I became a monster
Now I whistle they shoot missiles that could bring a helicopter down
In way over my head, I'm tryin' not to drown (Help)
Married to the game but made her cop the gown
Put it on, she dropped it down
Fucked her shit up doggy style (Yeah)
I let it go though, that's a lot for now
Okay

[Pre-Chorus]
To be honest lately I ain't been workin' (Yeah)
I've been layin' 'round like your everyday person (Yep)
Homie, I've been chillin' (Chillin')
Tryin' stay grounded (Grounded)
Made too much money, ain't even got the time to count it (No prob)
Yeah, and I ain't here to cry about my problems (No)
I ain't here to act like I don't got options (Okay)

[Chorus]
Is life really that bad?
Is life really that bad?
Is your life really that bad? (Why you mad, though?)
(Stop complainin')
Is your life really that bad? (Yep)
(Yeah, every day we survive, mane)
Is your life really that bad? (Why you mad, though?)
(Keep waitin', but they'll never stop hatin' on ya)
Yeah, if it is, lemme know (Let me know)
Gotta get up off your ass, everybody gotta go

[Verse 2]
Yeah, the flow is timeless
I don't got time for all these sensitive vaginas
Either catch up or get behind it (Yeah)
The highest climate, hot, probably melt your finest diamonds
Everybody got somethin' to say, just get in line with Simon
You call your momma, tell her I ain't done droppin' bombs
Finished shit with Donald Trump, probably time to call Ivana
Man, I'm the man, bet you wanna (Woo)
Now I see a shrink 'cause even kings, they need a doctor
When they sick wit it', ride wit' a pimp, bitch, I'm Xzibit (Indeed)
Dimwitted, old Jewish spit kidders
Still ain't finished, paint drippin'
Nah, I ain't God, but I came wit' him (Woo), pain in 'em
Homie, I was blind before I gained vision (Vision)
Went from hell to heaven, shit, I changed prisons (Prisons)
Motherfuckers whinin' like Jerry when Elaine trippin'
Shit, it's the Pennsylvania friendly neighbor
Bars gettin' served like a tennis player
Order an extra waiter wit' it (Can I help you?)
Never let the pressure break you wit' it
Oh, life and the monster that it makes you wit' it (Makes you wit' it)
God, this a cause for celebration (Yeah)
I know heaven's waitin' but this music shit, that's elevation

[Pre-Chorus]
To be honest lately I ain't been workin' (Workin')
I've been layin' 'round like your everyday person (Person)
Homie, I've been chillin' (Chillin')
Tryin' stay grounded (Grounded)
Made too much money, ain't even got the time to count it (No prob)
Yeah, and I ain't here to cry about my problems (No)
I ain't here to act like I don't got options (Okay)

[Chorus]
Is life really that bad? (Not really)
Is life really that bad?
Is your life really that bad? (Hell no)
(Stop complainin')
Is your life really that bad? (Yeah)
(Yeah, every day we survive, mane)
Is your life really that bad?
(Keep waitin', but they'll never stop hatin' on ya)
Yeah, if it is, lemme know
Gotta get up off your ass, everybody gotta go

[Outro]
Woo
Good mornin'
No prob
Yeah, that's all I got for now
Takin' notes, jot it down
'Cause the paper longer than the Gotti trial
Take it all, leave it dryer than a water drought
Verse 1

I wanna make sure this ain't a dream, (Dream)

Bridge

I said it's just like fire, shot up in my bones
Cause you take me higher, 3, 2, 1, let's go

Chorus

I got a house but I want a home
I got a heart but it's full of stone

(Ikay)

A thug changes, love changes

You babe
Missing is you babe
I'm bout to put your face up on a milk carton
Yeah, hey...

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's been a while without your face
But I saw your picture on the wall the other day
Too much distance, too much space
You need to come back home or run along, yeah
I'm waitin' for the light to change
You ask me how I've been, well I'm good, I can't complain
Times get harder, things get strained
All I know, I don't want you gone

[Chorus]
I know it hasn't been easy lately
But you don't wanna leave me, baby
And you know I hate to keep you waitin'
But when it's right, then it's right, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Days turn into nights
Conversations turn into fights, we gon' be alright
Love turn into life
Girl, you been burnin' so bright, let me turn off the lights
Stay awake 'til the mornin', yeah
It ain't always great, but it's never borin', yeah

[Verse 2]
And I been itchin' for your love
Don't want to feel a single thing if it ain't your touch
I get drunk and become numb
Just want to stumble into us
But baby, don't stop now 'cause it ain't over, yeah
Few years ago I was so dumb
Clueless, young and stupid, but look at who I have become
I ain't gonna break your heart, promise it's always safe
Baby, don't go now, pull me closer

[Chorus]
I know it hasn't been easy lately
But you don't wanna leave me, baby (Woah)
You know I hate to keep you waitin'
But I know when it's right, then it's right, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Days turn into nights
Conversations turn into fights, we gon' be alright

Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
La-di-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, there's a room somewhere up above the trees
And once you get there, you don't ever wanna leave no-no-no, no (Ah, ah)
Feelin' good, feelin' free
When I can finally get away
When I can finally get away (Away, away, away, away)
I need to see it with my own eyes
Hope it remembers and it knows my face, face (Ooh-ah-ooh-da-da-mm-bah)
I'll come and see you if you don't mind
When I can finally get away
When I can finally get away

[Bridge: Mac Miller]

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
There's a place right up above the clouds (Yeah)
Somewhere in between later and right now, right now (Right now, right now, right now)
And you don't have to be scared, no
I'll be there when I can finally get away
When I can finally get away (Ooh-ah-ooh-da-da-mm-bah)
Soarin' uncontrollably, gravity ain't holdin' me down (Ha-ha), maybe I—
I'll fly to your front door some time
When I can finally get away

Get away, get away
Get away, get away
Get away, get away

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-uh-woah, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-uh-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Yeah, do you see us in Vegas pushin' that Monte Carlo?
Bet that money on baby, bet she don't leave me, oh, no
See them, he wears in the desert, look like a lake in the sand
Would you watch the sun burn out with me forever, ever, ever, ever?
You still intimidate me, keep me up on my toes now
Better man, what you made me, made me aware what I was missin'
Been missin' the way you give me envision, babe
Never thought I'd settle down, I can not lie to myself
I was busy focusin' on bein' by myself
Set my feelings to the side they all got dusty on the shelf
You wiped them down when I had nothin' left

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-uh-woah, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-uh-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

[Open verse]

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-uh-woah, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-uh-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

[Verse]
I had an outta body, off a half a molly
At the afterparty, had to grab a shawty
She was in the corner, all melancholy
We was both rollin', off the edamame
I feel the devil on me, I feel the pressure on me
Then I said "hey come here you ever met a zombie on" (ecstasy)
First the brain releases dopamines (uh)
Then you lose all control of things
I'm an addict myself so I know a fiend
When I see one in Fashion Nova jeans
I'm in that euphoric psychedelic state
All I remember is an angelic face
I feel myself start to elevate
To a place called (ecstasy)
Euphoria, it spoil ya
There's only two girls feel like its four of ya
Before you take this journey here's a tutorial
Take the Adderall with the Xans
That's the morse code
She took two and some coke, that's an Oreo
You don't remeber shit that how the story goes
Comin' down you gonna feel horrible
Just make sure you drink a lot of water though
Now you startin' to feel the side effects
Like you ain't had the right kinda rest
When you grind your teeth, and get outta breath
I suggest you take a seat cause you high as hell
But don't trip ya fully functional
You just feelin' comfortable
Stop at Walgreens get a Lunchable
You spent all your money on (ecstasy)

Ecstasy, ecstasy, (uh) ecstasy (uh)

Ah, love is old, love is new
Love is all, love is you

Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue

Ahh-ah-ah-ahhhh

[Verse 1]
For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In his way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

[Verse 2]
The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring don’t be late
Messrs. K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill
{Verse 4: Helter Skelter}
Yeahhhh!

Haha, oh, ahaha, ahahaha, haha

[Verse 1]
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

[Bridge 1]
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

[Verse 2]
Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest

[Instrumental: Ronnie Scott]

[Bridge 2]
Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
See how they run

{Instrumental: Billy Preston, George Harrison and Eric Clapton}

[Bridge 3: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
See how they run

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

[Verse 1: Demo}
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in, but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad

[Chorus: Take 1]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

{Verse 2: Take 1]
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

[Chorus: Take 26]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 3: Take 26]
Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know, I mean, er, yes, but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

{Chorus: Final Version]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever

{Instrumental mash-up solo}

Yes, me friend, me friend

The bars could not hold me
Force could not control me, now
They try to keep me down
But God put me around
Yes, I've been accused
Wrongly abused, now
But through the powers of the Most High
They've got to turn me loose

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't try to cold me up on this bridge, now

Woo, damn

Tore off the bow in a Bentley, fucking your ho in her kidney
Fuck up the city, I do not dance, I jiggy
Gun is tucked under this Fendi
I like it, I spend it, I just came right out the jeweller
The ice on my neck, and my wrist, and my fist, I ain't finished
I was just workin' at Denny's, came back and counted some millions
I ain't no regular civillian
Red, yellow, green, look like my neck a chameleon
Ugh, okay, spin it, ugh
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute
I hit his bitch, he offended
I'm in Givenchy and Fendi
They let me finish
I cut that Chevy for four day
My scammer bussing bottles off the '08
I cannot cuff, she fucking on my brozay
I'm just gon' fuck her, treat her like a throwaway
Ooh, damn, I ain't been broke in a minute
I'm at the mall out in Venice

Calling up Kelz, he did 250 on biddie
It ain't no biggie, uh
Moncler, kick it
Fucked that lil' bih, made a viddie
She wanna leak it
She wanna send it
Ayy, fuck that bitch, my face wasn't in it
Damn, bitch do scams on bitty
Bands in my hands look pretty
Hit another band on the 'gram, I'm litty
When I was broke, man, she fronted, but then I got rich and I hit it
Homie, I don't dance, I jiggy
Weed is so strong, I feel like I'm Popeye off the spinach
I cut the corner and bend it
Bitch, I'm a menace like Dennis
Don't sell me pussy, I need a percentage
If you gon' fuck me, this shit is expensive
Nordstrom Rack, swipe my gift
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute, ayy (Woo, woo, woo)

[Outro]
I ain't been broke in a minute, damn (Woo)
I ain't been broke in a minute (Woo, woo, woo)
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute (Woo)
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute, damn

Look, I fucked the bitch with a broomstick
The same broom that I didn't clean my room with;
Yeah, I'm on her peach like a fruit fly
Last Night I bumped into God, I be Too High
Like "Excuse you," I said, "Who are you?"
He said ''I'm  the motherfuckin reason you are you''
Really? Wow, You're the reason?
And all these time I thought it was Bitch ass Dwayne and Cita
Ehh, My Niggas nutty as a fruit pie
Shoulda Woulda Coulda mama should have got her tubes tied
The only job my bitch ever had is a boob job
Commit to the bitch? I'd rather commit suicide
I once knew a guy who knew a guy who had some weed
He turned out to be fruity, tried to suck my johnny apple seed
I ripped his fuckin heart out
And gave it to my girl on valentines day
And she still fuckin broke it
You hoe' bitch I hate you
Matter of fact, I love every bitch that ain't you
I heard they kick you out of heaven for dyking with angels
Ughhhhh!, I said I'll never think about you again
And you gave me brain, You're playing mind games
I tattoo these tears cos you a crying shame
I know you fuck niggas who on my team like Mama James
I fucked you raw and now a Nigga pissing fire rain
And now my dick mad at me, fuck!

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]

Its like its going crazy, Road lizards!

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Ughh

Should slit your motherfuckin' throat and make your neck smile
T. gave me Insomnia and made me calm down
And when my high came down, I burned the home down
I ain't on cloud nine, i'm on my own cloud
My friends are white, I might be hanging with the wrong crowd
Get it? Hangin'?
I'm titty-banging a bitch who still wear a training bras
I ate her fuckin heart out, it came with fries
And my soft drink, I don't blink, I see it all
My dick a ballerina, let me stick it in your Leotard

Hold my dick above your head like a MVP award
Ahh, I head you're back fucking your old Nigga

I cross my heart, hope to die
Met a bitch that was rich who never seen roaches fly
I took her to the South side, left her ass outside
Legs open mouth wide
I get high like them niggas on that movie How High
Or maybe higher 

[?] die or live in fear
I hope new rappers disappear
But I ain't worried 'cause they will in a year, haha
It's not even light out
You appear to be a queer

As the crowd cheers, thank you
I thank God every day because I ain't you, haha

[Bridge: Lil Wayne & Imogen Heap]

Shit, you still ain't finished?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne & Imogen Heap]
Alright, kiss me on my bullet wound
Before I jump the broom, I'd rather jump over the fucking moon
Your girl just told my girl she wanna lick what's in my underoos
And every time I tell her "Leave," she hate to go like summer school
I spit, I vomit, I pukes, I shits, I number twos
I makes money, makes moves and make fun of you
I jump off her clit and I land on her face
I squeeze on her tits 'til her implants deflate
Bet I jump off some shit and I land on my skate... board
If life is a bitch, mine is Betty... Ford
They try to make me go to rehab
Rest in peace Amy Winehouse
I hope I sign your autograph before I sign out
Merlot color flag with my 9 out
It's not even light out
I cock and shoot, look like I'm calling time-out
But I'm not

[Bridge: Lil Wayne & Imogen Heap]
But you've somewhere to be
I just shoot her
No hesitation
Pow

She know she like it

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & Imogen Heap]
Shanell just walked in
They find your hand sticking out the water like a shark fin
When I was young, I used to cry because I had dark skin
Martin Luther King gon' slap the shit out me when I die, man
I can make any bitch shit in my hand
And mush it in your face like a pie pan
I used to fuck your girl, but that pussy feel like dry land
Smoking on that good make me look like I'm from Thailand
Fuck y'all niggas, not literally
My girl from Italy
But fuck that shit, I'll make your bitch swallow my little me's
I make the healthiest motherfucker sick of me
And hoes wanna have my baby like Billie Jean
But beat it
Get it? Jerk it off, beat it
It's not even light out
Yeah, and dry pussy tastes better when it's bleeding
Now tweet it

If he keep on talkin' shit, I'll knock the meat out his taco
And I ain't playin', I got killers with me, ain't got no squealers with me
And the back of the milk carton say my ceiling's missing
And now my vision blurry and I'm with kissin' cousins
I'll make 'em rob you masked up, you think them bitches muslims
Scoob filmin' it, smooth criminal
I'ma prince, nigga, you Arsenio
We pick you off and bounce, that's the pick and roll
Crème de la crème, de la criminal
T, where you at? Make the blunt fat
Young Money that special team, run the punt back
Yeah, that's me in that 'Gatti with the hump back
I'll stick my thumb in her pussy with a thumbtack

[Chorus]
Sittin' in a cell (Woah)
To sittin' on a jet
From shittin' in a cell
To shittin' on a jet
I lost too many homies and I won too many bets
So I scratch, and yes, junior is the best, uh-huh

[Outro]
Uh-huh
Uh-huh

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last

For some California grass

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jojo

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I was fishin' in some pussy yesterday and caught a nut

Ain't afraid to die, I'm just afraid to die sober
Switchin' up my swag, bitch, my swag bipolar
Gat with that beam, give me self esteem
I murk your bitch ass just like Radio Raheem
Got this Chinese AK, that Uzi machine
That banana clip, all I need is peaches and cream
Marchin' on the moon, stompin' on the sun
French kiss a nun, with poison on my tongue
Smokin' on the good, coughin' up a lung
And you know who I be's, be's stupid and get stung
I brung some kush with me
I brung some crooks with me
And if you fishin' for greatness, you got your hooks in me
Yeah, I'm a boss and all I do is call the shots slime

Long time coming, I can't feel my fuckin' face
Weezy on the track, murder was the fuckin' case
Me? I just be chillin' like a villain off a killing
I could have my goons clean you out like penicillin
I could paint the walls with yo' blood like acrylic
Chopper leave you with a half back, Corey Dillon
Michael Jackson, off the wall, Weezy, no ceilings
And bitch, I'm still ballin' like Bo Diddley
Yeah, let's do this shit, I do this shit
Scary movie on my hip, keep a extra movie clip
Weezy F. Baby, and tonight, the F for foolishness
Two pony tails, damn right, Punky Brewster, bitch
I'm sicker than your granny, take the baby, kill the nanny
Get a blind ho pregnant, she'll never see the baby daddy
I'm a addict, a addict for suck, swallow and slave
You pussy ass niggas got me turning in my grave

[Chorus]
I got the whole fuckin' world on my shoulders
And I got everybody breathing down my back
And I try to get high to get over
Now you can catch a nut or catch a contact
Yeah, I got the whole fuckin' world on my shoulders
And I got everybody breathing down my back
And I try to get high to get over
Now you can catch a nut or catch a contact
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I don't give a shit ho, you can kiss my dick hole
Don't snort no shit, won't be no shit
But you can't tell that to this nose
Got the world on the end of my fish pole
Bad bitches at my dispose
Fuck you talking 'bout, bitch? I ain’t cold, I'm Nat King Cole
I unload, then I reload
Put the gun to your earlobe
I'll rob anybody, shit, I'll rob a Dinero
Shout out to my heroes, Mary Jane and 

[?]
I'm so swagged out, I put your head in her Louis bag
I'm off the wall, I'm off the motherfuckin' wall, y'all
I'll put a bitch through hell with gasoline drawers on
It's like my minds a parking lot, but all the cars gone
It said pussies get shot give me a hard on
Pause, some of these niggas is the laws
And some of these blood suckers need straws
Yeah, it's Weezy Baby, mothafucka
I'll D.O.A them motherfuckas, yeah

[Chorus]
I got the whole fuckin' world on my shoulders
And I got everybody breathing down my back
And I try to get high to get over
Now you can catch a nut or catch a contact
Yeah, I got the whole fuckin' world on my shoulders
And I got everybody breathing down my back
And I try to get high to get over
Bitch, you can catch a nut or catch a contact
Yeah

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade
He’d let us in, knows where we’ve been
In his octopus’s garden in the shade

[Verse 1]
I’d ask my friends to come and see
An octopus’s garden with me

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade

[Verse 2]
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hide-a-way beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus’s garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can’t be found

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade

{Drum Solo}
Great!
Oh!
Great!
Great that!
Beautiful!
Sensational!
Fab!
Isn't that great?

[Verse 3]
We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they’re happy and they’re safe
We would be so happy, you and me
No-one there to tell us what to do

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden with you
In an octopus’s garden with you
In an octopus’s garden with you

[Outro}
Oooh

[Verse 1: Yesterday (Onwards)]
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

[Chorus]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Verse 2]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Chorus]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Outro]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Mm-Hm-Hm-Mm-Mmm..

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen cookin' up, got your own bread
Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Shout-out to your mom and dad for makin' you
Standin' ovation, they did a great job raisin' you
When I create, you're my muse
That kind of smile that makes the news
Can't nobody throw shade on your name in these streets
Triple threat, you a boss, you a bae, you a beast
You make it easy to choose
You got a mean touch, I can't refuse (No, I can't refuse it)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer

Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Already passed, you don't need no approval
Good everywhere, don't worry 'bout no refusal
Second to none, you got the upper hand now
Don't need a sponsor, nope, you're the brand now
You're my rock, my Colorado
Got that ring, just like Toronto
Love you now, a little more tomorrow
This how I feel, act like you know that you are

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Quavo]
Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
Shower you with all my attention

Heart full of equity, you're an asset (Asset)
Make sure that you don't need no mentions (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, these are my only intentions (Quavo)

[Verse 3: Quavo]
No cap, no pretendin', you don't need mentions (No cap)
Got 'em sayin' "goals," they don't wanna be independent ('Pendent)
Tell them to mind your business (Woo), we in our feelings
It's fifty-fifty percentage (Fifty), attention, we need commitment (Oh)
We gotta both admit it (Both), it's funny, we both listen (Both)
It's a blessing (Blessing) 'cause we both get it (Both)
You the best thing (Woo), and I don't need a witness (Best thing)
I'ma find me a ring and pray it's perfect fitted (Perfect, perfect, perfect)

Yeah, these are my only intentions

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
Only intentions
That's all I plan to do

[Intro]
Let me talk to you, uh

[Verse 1]
Remember back when nigga rolled up blunts instead of papers, wasn't too many haters
Just a couple fools I had problems with
And if I seen 'em, it was a while before I got 'em but at least I copped 'em
Sunk in my seat, rolling up with some wild ones
Putting niggas on, we the ones that you got your style from
I was focused on letting the money pile up
Sending it back yo, this pack ain't loud enough
Hopped in my whip quick then turned the volume up
Niggas who talk shit to me, that's childish bruh
Instead of hating just upgrade your status
Came from nothing, we ain't taking pacing backwards, only thing that matters
We all ran from police, most of us ain't get captured
Money under the mattress, roll this joint, I'ma tax it
You wasn't there, you don't know what a classic is
Just roll one up, try your best to imagine this

[Chorus]
Just imagine, just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Imagine that, imagine that, imagine that, imagine that
Just imagine, just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Imagine that, imagine that, imagine that, imagine that

[Verse 2]
Floating down the street, no cops on the scene
Everyone chilling in peace, everyone getting their piece
Every father kissing their babies 'fore they go to sleep
Ain't no one caring if it's expensive shit or if it's cheap
Everybody fresh so it don't matter who the cleanest
You could start off small, later turn into a genius
I ain't just talking, say it to you 'cause I seen it
Niggas keeping it real, they don't do it 'less they mean it
Feel like I really ain't from this world then my car ain't neither
Told her she 'bout to fall off if that broad can't keep up
Get so high phone turning it off so them calls can't receive 'em
Every year I'm setting my goals and make sure I achieve 'em
Boy I'm here for a reason
Gon' be going all year, you just had a good season
I work to be that nigga dog, don't just happen to be him
Blowing that weed when I pull up, they get happy to see him
Just relax, roll up, and chief one

[Chorus]
Just imagine, just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Imagine that, imagine that, imagine that, imagine that
Just imagine, just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Imagine that, imagine that, imagine that, imagine that

[Intro]
Ugh, you're a monster

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby "The
Brain" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the

[Chorus: Juice WRLD with Eminem]
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

[Chorus: Juice WRLD with Eminem]
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

[Verse 3: Eminem]
If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a—

[Outro: Eminem]
Man, stop
Look what I'm plannin', haha

[Intro]
Aaahh
Aaahh
Aaahh
Ah, Look at all the lonely people

[Verse 1]
Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

[Chorus]
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

[Verse 2]
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

[Chorus]
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

[Refrain]
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!

[Verse 3]
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

[Chorus:]
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all belong?

I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly
I'm crying

Sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you’ve been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long

I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob

Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the Sky, see how they run
I'm crying, I’m crying
I'm crying, I'm crying

Yellow matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down

[Chorus]
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob

[Instrumental]

[Verse 5]
Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come, you get a tan
From standing in the English rain

[Chorus]
I am the egg man (now good sir, what are you?)
They are the egg men (a poor man, made tame to fortune's blows)
I am the walrus, goo goo g’joob (good pity)
G-goo goo g’joob

[Verse 6]
Expert, textpert, choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you?
(ho ho ho, hee hee hee, ha ha ha)
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they snide
I’m crying

[Verse 7]
Semolina pilchard
Climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe

[Verse 1]
Oh yeah, I'll tell you something
I think you'll understand
When I'll say that something
I want to hold your hand

[Chorus]
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand

[Bridge]
And when I touch you I feel happy inside
It's such a feeling that my love
I can't hide
I can't hide
I can't hide

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you got that something
I think you'll understand
When I feel that something
I want to hold your hand

[Chorus]
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

[Pre-Bridge]
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

[Pre-Bridge]
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Bridge]
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around, now it may show
I don't know, I don't know

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

[Pre-Bridge]
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

[Intro}
Sugarplum fairy, sugarplum fairy

[Verse 1]
I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

[Instrumental Midtro + alarm clock rings]

[Bridge]
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

{Chord]
Ahhhhaaaaahhhhaaaahhhhhhahhhhhhhh

[Verse 2]
I read the news today, oh boy
4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on

[Instrumental Outro + Final Chord]

[Verse 1]
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Verse 2]
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

[Verse 3]
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Verse 4]
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how
You were inverted
No one alerted you

[Verse 5]
I look from the wings at the play you are staging
While my guitar gently weeps
As I’m sitting here, doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Outro}
Dab the mic on the piano, and quite low, this, just keep it in like, maracas you know. You know those old pianos
Okay we're on. Mouth

[Intro]
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

[Verse 1]
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy

[Verse 2]
Nothing you can make that can't be made
No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time
It's easy

[Chorus]
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

[Chorus]
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

[Verse 3]
There's nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
There's nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be
It's easy

[Chorus]
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need
All you need is love (All together now)
All you need is love (Everybody)
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

[Chorus]
Love is all you need (Love is all you need)
Love is all you need (Love is all you need)
Love is all you need (Love is all you need)
Love is all you need (Love is all you need)
Love is all you need (Love is all you need)

[Instrumental Intro}

[Verse 1]
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Verse 2]
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

[Pre-Chorus]
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Verse 3]
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly, someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahhhhh
{Instrumental Outro]

Aaaahhhh

{Instrumental Orchestra]

[Verse 1]
Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying

[Verse 2]
We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away

[Verse 3]
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew

[Chorus]
Try to realize it’s all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

[Outro]
Enihsnus Ho
Enihsnus Ho

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Ain't nothing changed at least for me feelings still the same
We been together too long to be involved in childish games
Although at times you nag being with you is really not that bad
We reminisce and get to trippin' off fights we had
We went bustin' all my windows stealin' all my indo
Catchin' me with old hoes cuttin' up my new clothes
Shavin' my head with a razor givin' me massages
Even though you stole my heart I ain't the type to press charges
It's a sticky situation the drama I be facing
Trying to take my baby mama on a fantasy vacation
While I'm snatchin' and taking I'll be stacking while I'm macking
'Cause you know my kids need transportation
I hate to see you waitin' at the train station
Walkin' in puddles that drizzlin' rain making
And even though my moms hate you and ya moms can't stand me
Dont even trip we got our family

[Chorus: Danny Boy, Natasha Walker, 2Pac]
Even though we argue to death
Girl you know I still love ya to death
(My baby Mama)
Even though we might fuss and fight
Best believe we gon' thug tonight
(My Baby Mama)
Even though I know I drive her crazy!
She happy that she had my baby!
(My Baby Mama)
We both mad 'cause I broke the house
We both mad 'cause we bonded for life
(My Baby Mama)

[Verse 2: Mussolini]
I got a special kind of baby
We don't go thru too much drama
We always try to solve our problems
Even though she like to argue
And I sometimes I dont want to
Damn, every day it be always somethin'
I know she only mad
'Cause her stinkin' ass love me
And Lil Syke ass look just like me
Even when she fight me
She really wanna kiss me
Even when she despise me
Her ass really miss me
I ain't lying I be missing her too
You had a good Baby Mama you'll be missing her too
It ain't a thang you could say about her
It ain't a day without her
Forever we bonded, uhh

[Chorus: Danny Boy, Natasha Walker, 2Pac]
Even though we argue to death
Girl you know I still love ya to death
(My baby Mama)
Even though we might fuss and fight
Best believe we gon' thug tonight
(My Baby Mama)
Even though I know I drive her crazy!
She happy that she had my baby!
(My Baby Mama)
We both mad 'cause I broke the house
We both mad 'cause we bonded for life
(My Baby Mama)

[Verse 3: Kadafi]
She said I'm gettin' on her last nerve
At it too can outlast hers
And you can guess who get the last word, uhh
I let her get that
My son know who daddy is
I can remember when we ain't even had a kid
And that's a terrible thought
Some cats run from responsibility
Caught by the courts
But you judged by the court of the law
She ain't got a father to hug
And you ain't got a daughter to call
If yo baby mama yo wife
Or you got visitation rights
You need to make it right
It ain't ya life
Dawg it's the child involved
Get along
No matter what that's gon' be ya baby moms
If another nigga fuck her
You will not trust her
But you still gotta love her
Ya first baby mother
I ain't break the roof
I'ma state the truth
Every day ain't fruits
But we makin' it thru
Come on...

[Chorus: Danny Boy, Natasha Walker, 2Pac]
Even though we argue to death
Girl you know I still love ya to death
(My baby Mama)
Even though we might fuss and fight
Best believe we gon' thug tonight
(My Baby Mama)
Even though I know I drive her crazy!
She happy that she had my baby!
(My Baby Mama)
We both mad 'cause I broke the house
We both mad 'cause we bonded for life
(My Baby Mama)

[Verse 4: Napoleon]
I might stay out late
From stackin' all the money I make
While them other bitches keepin' it fake
You was keepin' it real
With the young soldier out on the field
Plus I understand the way that you feel
You fuckin' with me
While them other bitches nuttin' to me
I knew that you was coming with me
It was no surprise
When I met you and I looked in yo eyes
You stopped fuckin' with them other guys
It used to be some creep shit
Til we got into some deep shit
Said I got her pregnant
Said that she was keepin' it
I had her sprung
Lil mama was young
Never thought that this time would come
Now you the one
Stickin' it out
With or without
Thru the bullshit workin' it out
You be workin' yo mouth
But you get the benefit of the doubt
Any other bitch I'm kickin' her out
For my baby mama

[Chorus: Danny Boy, Natasha Walker, 2Pac]
Even though we argue to death
Girl you know I still love ya to death
(My baby Mama)
Even though we might fuss and fight
Best believe we gon' thug tonight
(My Baby Mama)
Even though I know I drive her crazy!
She happy that she had my baby!
(My Baby Mama)
We both mad 'cause I broke the house
We both mad 'cause we bonded for life
(My Baby Mama)

[Verse 1]
Slow down before eveything change
24/7, I say, "Things are lookin' up"
But I could be drunk, I just—
Hold onto my arm one time
If you get dizzy, that's fine
Just don't get stuck
Yeah, and fall, and fall

[Refrain]
Watch it go
Down, down, down, down
Like a brand new submarine

[Verse 2]
Uh, lovin' you is takin' its toll
Tell you everything that I know
But it don’t mean much
When we're in a rush
Just, thinkin' of takin' it slow
We can 

[?] 'til the sun come up, uh
And watch the sun come up

[Refrain]
Now watch it go
Down, down, down, down
Brand new submarine

[Chorus]
Come around with your love, oh, baby, I'm in need
Come around with your love, oh, baby, I'm in need
Come around with your love, oh, baby, I'm in need
Come around with your love, oh, baby, I'm in need

[Verse]
Who you, who I?
Blue eye, blue eye
Fine line, fine line
We fallin' behind

[Chorus]
Come around with your love, oh, baby, I'm in need
Come around with your love, oh, baby, I'm in need
Come around with your love, oh, baby, I'm in need
Come around with your love, oh, baby, I'm in need

[Verse 1]
Looking at you
Watching the shriveled flower you bloomed
I feel it too
Inside the gray light of my room
Am I just like you?
Am I gonna be there way too soon?
'Cause I see the noose
It follows me closely whatever I do

[Chorus]
I can't lose it
The feeling I'm going down
I can't lose it
I'm watching my mother drown

[Verse 2]
Something feels loose
I'm falling to pieces from one little screw
I cry to the moon
And beg it to change me or rip me in two
There's pieces of you
They cover my body, it's so hard to chew
And I see the noose
It's stuck to my fingers, I've pulled at the glue

[Chorus]
I can't lose it
The feeling I'm going down
I can't lose it
I'm watching my mother drown
I never told you how it felt
How could I? When every impulse in myself
Would have me jumping roof to roof
And hanging tied up and torn between the two

Did you find peace? I know you worried 'bout me
And for that, I can't apologize
If you could see me now, you'd find
There's someone you wouldn't even recognize, yeah

I never told you what it meant
As if I could even shake it down by then
The sands are shifting all the time
In the end, somebody's got to draw the line

Was there no clue? Whatever happened to you?
And should I care if I lose a friend?
'Cause if you're looking for some truth
You'd see my green eyes ain't looking back at you

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Cut my heart about one, two times
Don't need to question the reason I'm yours, I'm yours
I'd move the Earth and lose the fight just to see you smile
'Cause you got no flaws, no flaws

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I'm not tryin' to be your part-time lover
Sign me up for that full-time, I'm yours, all yours

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta say?
What a man gotta pray?
To be your last "Goodnight" and your first "Good day"
So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta do?
What a man gotta prove?
To be totally locked up by you

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
You ain't trying to be wasting time
On stupid people and cheap lines I'm sure, I'm sure
So I‘d give a million dollars just for you to grab me by the collar
And knock on these doors, these doors

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I'm not tryin' to be your part-time lover
Sign me up for the full-time, I'm yours, I'm yours, woo!

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta say?
What a man gotta pray?
To be your last "Goodnight" and your first "Good day"
So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta do?
What a man gotta prove?
To be totally locked up by you

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Tell me what a man gotta do

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
So, what a man gotta do? (What a man gotta do?)
What a man gotta do? (What a man gotta do, yeah?)
To be totally locked up by you (Totally locked up by you)
What a man gotta say? (What a man gotta say?)
What a man gotta pray? (What a man gotta pray?)
To be your last "Goodnight" and your first "Good day" (Ayy)
So, what a man gotta do? (What a man gotta do?)
What a man gotta do? (Woah)
To be totally locked up by you (Totally locked up by you)
What a man gotta do? (Hey, baby)
What a man gotta prove? (What a man gotta prove?)
To be totally locked up by you (Totally locked up by you)

[Intro]
It is if everyone dies alone
Does that scare you?
I don't wanna be alone

[Verse 1]
I look for you
Every day, every night
I close my eyes
From the fear, from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
As I wander down the avenue, so confused
Guess I'll try and force a smile

[Chorus]
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for

[Verse 2]
I long for you
Just a touch (Does that scare you?)
Of your hand
You don't leave my mind
Lonely days, I'm feeling
Like a fool for dreaming

[Pre-Chorus]
As I wander down the avenue, so confused
Guess I'll try and force a smile

[Chorus]
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for

[Bridge]
I just want somebody to die for (To die for)
I just want somebody to die for
(Does that scare you?)
(I don't wanna be alone)

[Chorus]
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway (Oh)
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for
I just want somebody to die for (To die for)

[Verse 1: Drive My Car]
Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said baby, can't you see
I wanna be famous, a star on the screen
But you can do something in between

[Chorus]
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you

Beep beep'm beep beep yeah!

[Taxman Solo]
Aaaahhhh!

[Verse 2: What You're Doing]
Look what you're doing, I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

[Verse 3]
You got me running, and there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

[Bridge: The Word]
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love

[Outro: Drive My Car]
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Day after day, alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

[Verse 2]
Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around
{Instrumental bridge}

[Verse 3]
And nobody seems to like him, they can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do)
Round and round and round and round and round

[Verse 4]
And he never listens to them, he knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

[Chorus]
The fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

[Outro]
Ooh (Round and round and round)
Ooh (Round and round and round)

[Intro]
(Help!) I need somebody
(Help!) Not just anybody
(Help!) You know I need someone
(Help!)

[Verse 1]
When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

[Chorus]
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

[Verse 2]
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before

[Chorus]
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

[Verse 3]
When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

[Chorus]
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
Help me? Help me?
Oooooooohhhhh

Sun, sun, sun, Sun, sun, sun
Aaaaaahhhhooooohh
Sun, sun, sun, Sun, sun, sun

{Chorus}
Here comes the sun, doo-dun doo-doo
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Verse 1]
Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun, doo-dun doo-doo
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Verse 2]
Little darling, the smile's returning to their faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Bridge]
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes

[Verse 3]
Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun, doo-dun doo-doo
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun, doo-dun doo-doo
Here comes the sun
It's all right
It's all right

Teams get slept on, dreams get slept on
Say it with your chest bone, no brace pressed on
No cap, jet gone, jet fuel, kept going
No cap, jet gone, get on then get left home

*Lyrics from Snippet*

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]

[?] it
Go check my average, I'm on the arrogant
I give up (?) if she is relevant
I'm the magnificent, ain't that imperative
I'm gonna whoop this-
Lyrics from Snippet

[Part I: "Godzilla"]

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
(Ooh, ooh ooh)
And I won't let them get the best of me (In the sunken-)

[Part II: "Alien"]

[Verse 1: CyHi The Prynce]
Alien, magical flying cars
Gradient, transition from light to...

[Chorus]
(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take y'all back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that, mommy, can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cause a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'ma love you 'til you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)

[Chorus]
(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)

[Verse 2]
Forrest Gump mama said, "Life is like a box of chocolates"
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir, please
Give me a verse of "You Are So Beautiful To Me"
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit' me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey, y'all say, Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)

[Chorus]
(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)

[Bridge]
I guess it also depends though if my ends low
Second, they get up you gon get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)

[Verse 3]
Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'ma get you a Jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say: (Hey Mama)

[Chorus]
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
You know I love you so
I never let you go
Wrote this song just so you know
No matter where you go our love is true
Mama mama mama mama mama...
Mama mama mama mama mama...

[Verse 1]
Bleeding into the brains of
Your cat, small fish, dog
She lays at night
(Right by the speeding light)
Seeping through the bolts and cogs
Of these machines of fog
That we sit inside
(They sit inside)
Young man turnin' in on himself
Felt the horror through her

[Chorus]
Let go
Let go
Let go
Another pair of eyes
Let go
To see they sacrifices

[Verse 2]
He's creepin' 'round the aisles of
The supermarket mall
(Shut the door, shut the)
(Let them burn, it sets you free)
Freeing from the battlefields
Young children with shields

[Chorus]
Of love
Of love

[Outro]
We have to rise above
(Enough's enough's enough's enough)
(Enough's enough's enough)
(Enough's enough's enough's enough)
(Enough's enough, enough's enough)
What's your worth?
(Hahaha, fuck all that, man)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, she's my sweet
My sweet and sour, my lemon honey
I ran all the way home that night
Ran all the way home right back to my mummy
Ain't allowed in the park
Exiled, couldn't even do one keepie uppie
The cars on my road almost hit me in a hurry
The cars are just a sign of another yuppie
Down in the dirt
I used to surf with my bucket from Kentucky
I had a scratch card, I scratched so hard
'Cause I'm feelin' fuckin' lucky, boy, I'm feelin' so lucky
On my tenth birthday, got a puppy
Now I'm back in the park with the middle class yobs
Tryna get lucky
I was little once more
Weed smoke made me feel so yucky
Pullin' on my brain, born
Another fuckin' junkie, born
Another fuckin' scum, torn apart
I was little once more, weed smoke, agh

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm stoned again
I'm stoned again
I'm high again, boy
Oh, I'm stoned again
I'm stoned again
I'm low again

[Verse 2]
Yeah, she's my sweet
My sweet and sour, my lemon honey
I ran all the way home that night
Ran all the way home right back to her, back to her
Down in a high
I used to pick up all the pieces and I went home
I used to pick her up
I used to pick it up

[Chorus]
I'm stoned again
I'm stoned again
I'm high again, boy
There's a television
There's a television speaking to me
There's a French girl
On my television
She's crying in the palm of my hand

In moving metal
I read the paper, or just the photos
I rip one out with my hand
There's a massacre
Across the o-, across the o-
Across the ocean
I can see it in the palm of my hands

Me hundo cada vez más hondo

Below the ground floor
We're losing signal, we've lost connection
I left her dying, she was still crying
And now she's lying in my head
Above the third rail, shrapnel flying
Next door's wobbling
But I'm riding to the end
What am I good for? (What am I good for?)
I've got no signal
Abandoned to the voice in my head

[Outro]
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I-
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I-

[Verse 1]
Woke up, Peckham Rye at half five
Boy on the ground with his pants down
What happened to him in his past life?
What happened to him in his park side?
Roads were busy, buses passed by
I wonder who saw me, I was the last guy
Think it was Willem
He said I was headed in through the poolside
I hustled the cold keys 'til 5AM
But all I got was swept aside
Like the pesticide in your vegetables
It sounds like

[Chorus]
Like the worries of those at the worst times
Like the worries of those at the worst times
Like the worries of those at the worst times
Like the worries of those at the worst times

[Verse 2]
Not again, it's Peckham Rye at half five
Boy on the ground with his pants down
What happened to him in his past life?
Spilled blood from his dome in his past time
Has it happened again? Is the skull slight?
Is the gold fine?
At least my nose ain't bent, but my brain's fryin'
Think they asked for a light, then they offered a line
Fought from some worst of men, but I'm glad to decline
Must've triggered somethin', enhanced masculine
And after I squish it in, self-esteem insulin

[Chorus]
That contorts the glows at the worst times
It contorts the glows at the worst times
This contorts the glows at the worst times
It contorts the glow at the worst times (A waste of time)

[Post-Chorus]
A waste of time
A waste of time
A waste of time
A waste of time
A waste of time
A waste of time
A waste of time
A waste

[Outro]
Sick
Um, then, I'll be quick then
I've pinched a van off work tonight
I didn't, I didn't get an answer off you about the amp
I was seeing if I could just drop that
I don't know if your mum's in tonight or anyone
Just drop that 'round, if that's alright

[Verse 1]
Start making sense of things
I saw pylons stretch to the east
I wasn't sure at all why our love
Becomes sorrow and withers free
Ran a firework of dogs to walk with me
Felt this warm
Marching forth
I felt their warmth
Marching forth
We could be

[Outro]
The dream
The dream
The dream
The dream
The dream
The dream

[Verse 1]
See, I have not seen
Another person for days
You're the only one
Who's held my gaze
And everyone must have left
I used to walk through the strange cold depths
Of the crane's cold stretch
That haven't seen the face

[Verse 2]
I dreamt I was here before
Above wet pavements
Across deep blue skies she would soar
Leaving her engravement
And everything sunk its stress
But for my drunken mess
And if the pain compress
Then it's something less to explain

[Verse 3]
I felt this fear before
I miss my best ailment
Bruising on my right side feels so
With thoughts of her displacement
And if there was nothing left
But for this strange deep rest
And the screams from my chest
Well, this heart's got no escape

[Chorus]
And it all falls back into place
The prisoner's skull
The prisoner's brains
Were beat to a pulp
The dreams told me
I dreamt I was here before
I dreamt I was here before
A cloudy view

[Outro]
I dreamt I was here before
I dreamt I was here before
Must have dreamt I was here before
I dreamt I was here before

[Intro]
Some things I just
Some things I just

[Verse 1]
Were you born in the air?
Sometimes I see planes
But I think of you, and I stare
Sweeping through the night sky
All of you flying by
How many of you are up there?
Perfectly above my head
With your cheeks on a chair
Some asleep
Some lit up by
Hollywood minds are clear
I feel the weight of the world go
I start my journey to and fro
Passport in my pocket's getting old
Feel the weight of the world dissolve

[Refrain]
You all look so small from up here
You all look so small from up there
You all look so small from up here

[Verse 2]
Is there concerns in the air?
You flew economy
Reserved your ecology
To escape this nightmare
A deluge of the world flows
Ain't too easy to see when it's
This lonely down here
So let's escape in this arrow
As if it weren't up to me
As if I did, I would care
From JFK down to Heathrow
Leave a window seat
I wanna feel free, up

[Intro]
Las maravillas del mundo
Recuerdas un día (De la mente)
Del abismo de la existencia
Recuerdos sumergentes
Recuerdos de la tierra

[Verse 1]
The sky was open and gorgeous
The blue was a view but was tortured
Chemtrails poke holes through commuters
Swept, swept, we went to find water
Tin can flew off to Mallorca
The TV had said that you ought to
The same show protested the order
From fifty foot, cigs blow smoke 'cross the border
To men that drowned holding their daughters
And weren't allowed refuge from the horrors
The instruction was mutual borders
I ain't felt this world and its orbit
Haven't felt this world and its orbit
TV runs the show's creds and goes dead
Now it's time to climb bed and be well-slept

[Outro]
Sometimes I watch the TV in my head
Sometimes I watch the TV in my head
The moon hangs above
Makes judgement of all of us
I've had enough, lover of what you think of me
I weren't sure at all of what I was supposed to be
The demon's key showing me up in times of need
By setting me through

She was like
"Nothing ever made me feel the way you do"
Is it real?
You came at last
Lock the door and run the bath
I was doing some good
I was keeping clean
Kept my head up above your intimacy or steadily
Your putrid ooze would swallow me
Is it meant to be?

And find me those big sad eyes
I lay down on the empty streets
The roads seem to lead me to you
Under the underclass
Deep in society's hole
That's where I saw you, love
And we're beneath it all
I had this feeling I was coming back
But little did I know
But little did I know
I had this feeling
The numb, it gonna spread through me, girl
Let the fire grow cold
And prepare that bed for me, yeah
I'm under your control

Under the underclass
Deep beneath it all
I had this feeling I was coming back
But little did I know
(But little did I know)

[Verse 1]
Please complete me
It must be the answer
Everything just seems to be numbness around
Why aren't you near me?
What stars are you under?
If only I could hear from you right now
Did your mind ever clear me?
Has your faith found a pastor?
Or am I still in shapes in the clouds?
Did you see me on TV?
Have you seen the disasters?
We don't have long 'til this earth is drowned
If only I had seen clearly as we lay beneath thunder
Feeling the feeling of pride
The pride that brought me down
When they all stood and cheered me
What made your departure?
I still remember you walking off in the crowd

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Yours sincerely
Eros' bow has no archer
Icarus still soars above the ground
The moon appears freely but arose to a structure
And our days and nights have been constantly letting me down
This place doesn't move me
Everything just seems to be numbness around
This place doesn't move me
Everything just constantly letting me down

[Outro]
Girl
Please complete me

[Verse 1]
Remembering running through my yard like a wild stream
Just a little kid, blood flowing into my rosy cheeks
Now a river runs red from my knuckles into the sink
And there's a pale girl staring through the mirror at me
Maybe it's just a dream, wish I could go back to sleep

[Verse 2]
Hydrangeas blooming off the branches of park trees
It's a half-hearted calm, the way I've felt since I was thirteen
'Cause I may not feel it now, covered up the wounds with my long sleeves
But I know it's waiting there, swimming through my bloodstream
And it's gonna come for me, yeah it's gonna come for me

[Chorus]
What did you have that I didn't?
And why am I so blue?
Someone's talking in my forehead
That says, "I'll never be like you"
Happiness is like a firefly on summer free evenings
Feel it slipping through my fingers
But I can't catch it in my hands
Catch it in my

[Verse 3]
Old memories, ribbons running down from my bare knees
I ran too fast, fell down on my face in the concrete
I guess the lesson's learned, I've barely left my room in the past week
And I've got my guard up trying all the time to stay clean
But I don't feel anything, I don't feel anything

[Chorus]
What did you have that I didn't?
And why am I so fucked?
There's someone talking in my forehead
That says, "I'll never be enough"
And happiness is like a firefly on summer evenings
Feel it slipping through my fingers
But I can't catch it in my hands
Catch it in my

[Verse 1]
I wanna be calm like the soft
Summer rain on your back
Like the fall of your shoulders
But everything just brings me back down
To the cold hard ground
And it keeps getting colder
It's a feeling that boils in my brain
I would dial back the flame
But I'm not sure I'm able
I'm wobbling out on the wire
And the lights could go out
With the break of a cable

[Pre-Chorus]
Things feel that low sometimes
Even when everything is fine

[Chorus]
Hey, I've been falling apart these days
Split open, watching my heart go
'Round and around, 'round and around
Circle the drain, I'm going down
('Round and around and around and around
'Round and around and around and around)

[Verse 2]
I'm trying to seem strong for my love
For my family and friends
But I'm so tired of faking
'Cause I'm chained to my bed when they're gone
Watching TV alone
'Til my body starts aching
And I think there's a mold in my brain
Spreading down all the way
Through my heart and my body
'Cause I cling to the dark of my room
And the days thin me out
Or just burn me straight through

[Pre-Chorus]
Things feel that low sometimes
Even when everything is fine

[Chorus]
Hey, I've been falling apart these days
Split open, watching my heart go
'Round and around, 'round and around
Circle the drain, I'm going down
('Round and around and around and around
'Round and around and around and around)

[Bridge]
Things feel that low sometimes
Even when everything is fine

[Chorus]
Hey, I've been falling apart these days
Split open, watching my heart go
'Round and around, 'round and around
Circle the drain, I'm going down
('Round and around and around and around
'Round and around and around and around)
'Round and around, 'round and around
Circle the drain, I'm going down

[Intro]
Okay, let's do it

[Verse]
I am a liar and my truths are shackled in
My dungeon of fire, I'm the princess of screwin' up
And you wear your armor
And you save pretty girls like me
But I'm not so pretty
When I am naked
You are a mirror
Say I'm the fairest of all
I am "fake it 'til you make it" in a can
And you have a calmness
That I could never understand
But you let me in and
You will regret it
'Cause I'm only looking
For my skewed reflection in you
Fallen out of what I thought was love
'Cause you are a question
That I thought I could solve
But you don't need solving
You're just not what I want
And I want an answer
To all my problems
But there's not an answer
I am the problem for me, now and always
I will break my own bones
'Til my legs stop walking
And my bed is my throne
My room is a kingdom
For the princess of screwin' up
And I'll be the dragon
I'll hold me captive
My world is sinking
And I am the captain of it all
Of it all
Of it all
Of it all
Mm-mm
I want someone who's following a dream
Someone like me
Who feels the air inside their body running free
I want the breeze

Well, the moon is in the water
And I'm dancing with the current and my clothes
Are on the beach
You stay with the earth
'Cause you don't understand why I would wanna freeze
The irony

We learned to dance, and I was swaying all alone
You're stiff as stone
You lock your heart up in a place I'll never know
The distance grows

Try to break your walls
But all I ever end up breaking is your bones
Bruises show
Standing in the living room
Talking as you're staring at your phone
It's a cold I've known
You watched me sink beneath the water like a stone
And then let go
I came for air and found that I was all alone
I should've known

Swam back to the shoreline
And found that all you left me was a note
I read it slow
You said that you had loved me
But you knew that you would end up on your own
A sinking stone
A sinking stone
A sinking stone
A sinking stone
A sinking stone
A sinking stone

[Verse 1]
Seeing black
Seep through the cracks
Pouring out of the walls
I watch it creep and crawl
Through my room
But I can't move
Sedate me all the time
Don't leave me with my mind
Paralyzed
Paralyzed

[Chorus]
Crawling in my skin
Crawling in my skin

[Verse 2]
Hide away
A quiet place
But it's with me all the time
In the corners of my mind
Calling me
Into a dream
With blood on my lips like wine
My eyes glow in the knife
Paralyzed
Paralyzed

[Chorus]
Crawling in my skin
Crawling in my skin
Crawling in my skin
Crawling in my skin

[Verse 1]
I hate to be this person
Who's climbing up the walls
I'm scared the girl you love is hardly ever here at all

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause no one's really known me like you did when we were young

[Chorus]
Our love was our everything, everything you want
But back then

[Verse 2]
Tell me that you need me
When everything is wrong
Be there in the morning
When the feeling ain't as strong

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause no one's really known me like you did when we were young

[Chorus]
Oh, love, am I everything, everything you want still?
Oh, love, am I everything, everything you want still?
You say we were built together
Scribbled on a piece of paper
And scattered apart
You say that we're drawn together
Pulled off the refrigerator
And magnetized at heart

But I don't think so
And I thought I told you so
But you pulled me close
And went through me like a ghost
And I hate the things
That get trapped inside my throat
How you made me feel
With your words like chloroform

And I hate the taste
That it puts into my mouth
Now I'm always stained
Like the sheets at my parents' house
Yeah, I'm always stained
And it's never coming out
Yeah, I'm always stained
It's a match that's been burned down

[Verse 1]
I should have known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?

[Chorus]
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

[Verse 2]
I let it burn
You're no longer my concern, mmm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn

[Chorus]
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

[Refrain]
No time to die, mmm
No time to die, ooh

[Outro]
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

(Wheezy outta here)

[Chorus]
I ain't ever talkin' to the 12 (Yeah)
I ain't runnin' 'round with no bells (Yeah)
They gave me hush money, I can't tell (Shh, woah)
Your diamonds all sunny and revealed, ooh (Ohhh)

[Post-Chorus]
Ohhh
Ayy

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, brush the dust of youth from off your shoulder
Because the years of fretting days is right behind you
Don't return to the fields of green where rainbow secrets were told
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and things and deeds

[Pre-Chorus]
I will show you a game where the winner never wins

[Chorus]
Let your hair hang down
Wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you

[Verse 2]
Lock away your childhood and throw away the key
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals
We shall drink the oldest wine, velvet skies will linger
Child, you're a woman, your heart and soul are free

[Pre-Chorus]
I will hold a lighted lamp and we shall walk together

[Chorus]
Let your hair hang down
Wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you

[Bridge]
Your darkened eyes throw mystery
But your lips are void of history
You could not imagine that it could happen this way, could you

[Pre-Chorus]
I will give you dreams and I'll tell you things you'd like to hear

[Chorus]
Let your hair hang down
Wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you
I said let your hair hang down
Wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you

Bad women, bad women harassin' (Woo)
She after me (After me), captured me, call me Michael

Chocolate covered, baby, you Nestle
I don't got no time to be wrestlin'
And I wanna know what the rest did
I want you to be my destiny

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Fried chicken and thick women, woah, woah, woah
Raf Simmons and new Bentleys, woah, woah, woah
Cockroaches in the building, woah, woah, woah
What's my business is my business, hey
I got Alzheimer's when it's 'bout women, woah, woah, woah
Hunnid million, a billion, woah, woah, woah
I was just fresh off titties, woah, woah, woah
Long way from Honda Civics, woah, woah, woah

[Intro+Drum beats]
Aah!

[Verse 1]
You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright
Alright
Alright

[Verse 2]
You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're all doing what we can
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright
Alright
Alright

[Instrumental Break+Moans]

[Verse 3]
You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright
Alright
Alright

[Outro]
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright!

Hey!

[Verse 1]
Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much, it makes you sorry
Still, you don't regret a single day

[Chorus]
Ah, girl
Girl, girl

[Verse 2]
When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the Earth to me and I believe her
After all this time I don't know why

[Chorus]
Ah, girl
Girl, girl

[Bridge]
She's the kind of girl who puts you down (tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
When friends are there, you feel a fool (tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
(Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
When you say she's looking good (tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
She acts as if it's understood (tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
She's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh (Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)

[Chorus]
Girl
Girl, girl

[Verse 3]
Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?

[Chorus]
Ah, girl
Girl, girl

[Outro]
Ah, girl
Girl, Girl
Girl, Girl
Girl, Girl
Girl, Girl

[Intro]
(1,2,3,4)

[Verse]
Woo!
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you have enjoyed the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We're sorry but it's time to go
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We'd like to thank you once again
Sgt. Pepper's one and only Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's getting very near the end
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Outro]
Woo!

[Verse 1]
Just a moment
Right before all the song and dance
Wasn't brave enough to tell you
But there ain't gonna be another chance
It's not long until (All that I have)
And everything's still (One more hour)
Minutes are racing, whatever I've done
I did it for love (All that I have)
I did it for fun (One more hour)
Couldn't get enough (All that I have)
I did it for fame (One more hour)
But never for money
Not for houses, not for her
Not for my future children
Until now

[Verse 2]
How could I love again?
How could I ever ask for more?
And to the road ahead
Into a life I can't ignore
(Lose her) How could I love again?
(Move on) How can I walk this path for sure?
(Lose her) With no more time to spare
(Move on) I know the answer more and more

[Chorus]
As long as I can, long as I can
Spend some time alone
As long as I can, long as I can
Be the man I am

[Bridge]
Ooh, life is strange
For one more hour
I can rage
For one more hour

[Chorus]
As long as I can (Lose her), as long as I can (Move on)
Spend some time alone
As long as I can (Lose her), as long as I can (Move on)
Remember who I am
As long as I can (Lose her), as long as I can (Move on)
Spend some time alone
As long as I can (How could I love again?), as long as I can
Be the man I am

[Outro]
Just a minute, fella, right before you go out there
All your voices said you wouldn't last a minute bare
One more hour and you'll know your life is one to share
Just a minute, baby, right before we go from here
All those people said we wouldn't last a minute near
I'm with you and I could roll into another year
Just a minute, fella, right before you go out there
All your voices said you wouldn't last a minute bare
One more hour and you'll know your life is one to share
Just a minute, baby, right before we go from here
All those people said we wouldn't last a minute near
I'm with you and I could roll into another year
Just a minute, fella, right before you go out there
All your voices said you wouldn't last a minute bare

[Chorus]
I'm about to do something crazy, no more delayin'
No destiny is too far
We can get a home in Miami, go and get married
Tattoo your name on my arm

[Verse 1]
This traffic doesn't seem quite as annoying
Quite alright, quite alright, sittin' here
Yes, reminiscent, I think this is different
I know this is different (I'm about to)
Let's cause something permanent
Just so we know we can

[Chorus]
I'm about to do something crazy, no more delayin'
No destiny is too far
Did you say, "And here comes forever"?
Oh, here forever, let go of me with open arms

[Verse 2]
We'll be lovers until the end of time (I'm about to)
I see it now
I see just how you're so right (I'm about to)
You're so clear now

[Chorus]
I'm about to do something crazy, no more delayin'
No destiny is too far
We can get a home in Miami, go and get married
Tattoo your name on my arm

[Outro]
Let's drink this magic potion
Of love and devotion
And then let's see how it goes

[Verse 1]
I close my front door and turn on the light
I let out a breath and hold in a sigh
Ain't nothin' new, ain't that much in sight
And if I'm counting days, dream fruition ain't what it's looking like

[Chorus]
But strictly speaking, I'm still on track
Strictly speaking, I'm holding on
More than a minor setback
But strictly speaking, I'm still on track
And all of my dreams are still in sight
'Cause strictly speaking, I've got my whole life
I lost a wheel a while back
But strictly speaking, I'm still on track
Challenges falling in my lap
Strung out again, but still on track

[Verse 2]
I know it's unrealistic, over-optimistic
I know I tried before this, I know it's nearly August
I know I can't ignore this, looking forward to all this
Sayin', "Babe, I just adore this" and, "Babe, can we afford this?"
I know it's been a slow year, nothin' much to show here
I didn't really go for it, so not a lot to show for it

[Refrain]
The hardest part is over, adjusting makes it slower
So glad you're comin' over, a wall to bring us closer
The world ain't waitin' for ya, nothin' to lose it over
We're just a little older, the rest comes easy
The rest comes easy

[Chorus]
('Cause life's like that)
But strictly speaking, I'm still on track
Strictly speaking, I'm holding back
Troubles keep falling in my lap
Yeah, but strictly speaking, I'm still on track
So tell everyone I'll be alright
'Cause strictly speaking, I've got my whole life
More than one major setback
But strictly speaking, I'm still on track (Yeah)

[Refrain]
The hardest part is over, adjusting makes it slower (Ooh)
So glad you're comin' over, a wall to bring us closer (Still on track, motherfucker)
The world ain't waitin' for ya, nothin' to lose it over
We're just a little older, the rest gets easy
The rest gets easy

[Intro]
It's like, "Oh, bass," cool
You know how you make the bass better?
Crank the bass up (Yeah)
You know how to make the kick drums better?
Just crank the bass up
And then it's like, "No, not really"

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Might just find it after all
Might just find it after all
Might just find it after all
Might just find it after all
Might just find it after all
Might just find it after all

[Outro]

[Verse 1: Thundercat]
Let me say, "Good morning", my friend
About last night, I don't know how it ended
I can't find my phone and I can't find my shoes
But nothing beats being in a party with you

[Chorus: Thundercat]
Let's do it all again
Let's do it again
Let's do it all again
Let's do it again

[Post-Chorus: Thundercat]
It's just more fun when you come around
Even if I act up
You let me know that I'm not crazy
Crazy
Crazy

[Verse 2: Louis Cole]
Yeah, I remember you were punching my friends
Made an oil spill that makes Exxon offended
Then you fell asleep on the laundry in my room
And this is why I love to party with you

[Chorus: Thundercat]
Let's do it all again
Let's do it again

[Break: Thundercat]
Let's do it all again
Let's do it again

[Verse 3: Thundercat]
When you're around, you know what to say
You brighten my day
I feel that it's crazy
When you're around
When you're around

[Verse 1: Thundercat & Steve Lacy]
I just bought a crib on top of the hill
And I bought a brand new ride, am I keepin' it real?
There's nothin' wrong if you got it
I'm not livin' in fear, I'm just bein' honest

[Chorus: Thundercat]
'Cause there's no more livin' in fear
No more livin' in fear
If we don't talk about it, then who will?

[Post-Chorus: Steve Arrington & Thundercat]
I know I give a different vibe, yeah (Then who will?)
I'm doin' what I like, whoa, whoa, whoa (Then who will?)
I don't need you co-sign (Who will?)
'Cause I'm young enough and I'm old enough, both at the same time-i-i-ime (Who will?)
Hey, don't trip on my aggression, baby, oh (Who will?)
'Cause I can go in new directions, baby (Who will?)
I'm just tryna live my life, do my best and that's alright (Who will?)
Yes, I'm comfortable and that's what's tight (Who will?)

[Verse 2: Thundercat & Steve Lacy]
Just moved out the hood, doesn't mean I'm doin' it good
Wanna post this on the 'Gram, but don't think I should
Is it just for me or am I paranoid?
Gotta keep it on the low 'cause I been robbed before

[Verse 3: Steve Arrington]
Sometime I wanna say that I'm blessed
Black man's grind gon' answer the test
Ah, the box you tried to throw me in don't fit me no more, no
Creative spirit talkin', creative spirit walkin'
And I don't wanna hurt nobody, hurt nobody, hurt nobody

[Chorus: Thundercat]
'Cause there's no more livin' in fear
No more livin' in fear
If we don't talk about it, then who will?

[Post-Chorus: Steve Arrington & Thundercat]
I know I give a different vibe, yeah (Then who will?)
I'm doin' what I like, whoa, whoa, whoa (Then who will?)
I don't need your co-sign (Who will?)
'Cause I'm young enough and old enough, both at the same, yeah (Who will?)
Ah, ah, don't trip on my aggression, baby, oh (Who will?)
'Cause I can go in different directions, baby (Who will?)
I'm just tryna live my life (Who will?)
I'm just tryna do what's right (Who will?)
Hi, hello
Is anybody there?
Let me know if you can hear me
It feels so cold and so alone
Just need some sort of sun
And I know, I know, I know
We're not alone
But it's hard to tell
Just let me know
So I can go
Because I can feel a pulse
Breathe, please breathe
Breathe for me
Breathe for me
Is it time to go?
Go and start the show
Somewhere lost in space

[Verse]
Somewhere beneath the stars
Beyond just more of our space
Nothing is yours, nothing is mine
We are decaying over time
I'm gonna find someone to love
Let's go together, innerstellar love

[Outro]
Innerstellar love
Ooh-ooh
Ah, ah, ah

[Verse]
Do the fuckin' happy dance
Even when you're really fuckin' mad
I guess that it's supposed to subside
Even though you're probably really mad
Even if you're really, really sad
You can probably be worse
Just have that sink in for a while
It's okay if it's not goin' your way
It never was
Don't believe their hype
It's probably all covered in lies
I should take my own advice
Even if it hurts, it's always gonna hurt the same
Hurt the same
Dance away the pain
It's gonna be alright
Just do the fuckin' dance
Even if you started to cry
It's okay
Everything will be alright
Take your time, Rome wasn't built in a day
It's okay, it's time to dance away your pain
It's alright
Just do the happy dance
Even if you're not alright
It's okay
Joy inside your pain
That's alright
Sometimes pain, it just fades
And then you'll breathe
Just dance
You will be alright
Keep dancin'
Even though you're not alright again
It's alright
Dance
The sun will eventually shine

[Verse 1]
Do you mind if I wild out
A little?
'Cause I'm just a little drunk and I wanna come party with you
A little
Can I look into your eyes?
I can tell that you're high too
But that's okay, baby, 'cause I just wanna party with you

[Chorus]
'Cause when we hit the peak, baby
I just wanna party with you
All night

[Verse 2]
Someone hold my phone 'cause I can't hold my tongue
'Cause if I get too drunk, baby, then I'm gonna ruin the fun
That's not your problem, it's because I've seen too much, baby
Sorry if I get a little PTSD

[Chorus]
But I just wanna party with you
All night
Because you make me happy
That's right
I only wanna party with you
Tonight
Because you make everything
Alright

[Verse: Thundercat]
Girl, you're so fly (So fly)
You really blow my mind (My mind)
Let's not waste any more time
I'll just meet you overseas
We can do it on the plane
I just wanna be with you
I wanna meet you in Brazil
Take you to a place that you never been before
We can just lay on the beach
And just fall asleep, or maybe meet up in Japan
Maybe we can just hold hands
Let's go get drunk in Golden Gai
Maybe meet up in Russia
Meet up in Russia
I don't really care who sees
Let's join the mile high club

[Outro: Zack Fox]
Ladies and gentlemen, this is, uh, your captain speaking
Gonna ask that, uh, on our descent here into Moscow
Everybody, please put your seatbelts on
Winds are gettin' a little bit choppy and
There appears to be a shiny black man up there in first class
Gettin' some sloppy-toppy, hahaha
He's got all his chains on and a durag
Is that Thundercat?
What's up, brother?

[Verse 1]
I feel kinda fly standin' next to you
Baby girl, how do I look in my durag?
Would you tell me the truth?
Stay with me and love me through the night, endlessly
I'ma keep on all my chains when I'm makin' love to you
Hold me close and let me squeeze you tight through the night
But, baby girl, how do I look in my durag?
Would you tell me the truth?

[Verse 2]
Do you like my new whip?
Watch me go zoom, zoom
Baby girl, how do I look in my durag?
Would you tell me the truth? (Lie to me?)
Stay with me and love me through the night, endlessly
I just wanna know how you feel
Tell me, am I doin' it right?

[Verse 3]
I may be covered in cat hair, but I still smell good
Baby, let me know, how do I look in my durag?
Don't lie to me, let me rock you all night long
I'm tryna impress you, girl
Let me know, how do I look in my durag?
I'm tryna get intimate
Let me love you like you never been before, baby (Ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ooh-ooh)

[Verse 4]
You don't have to like my video games or my comic books
But, baby girl, how do I look in my durag?
Did I tie it right?
Did you wear that dress just for me?
'Cause I'm tryna smash
Baby girl, I'ma smash in my durag
'Cause it's only right

[Verse 5]
Do you like the way my ice drips in the light?
Baby girl, do you like me in my durag?
Let me know
Would you let me know?
Let me know, girl
Let's make love until we fall asleep
I like the way you feel next to me
Baby, you look so good in this moonlight
Stay with me and love me through the night, baby
Let's make love until we fall asleep

[Chorus: Thundercat & Ty Dolla $ign]
I'll keep holdin' you down (Holdin' you down)
Even though you're not around (You're not around)
So hard to get over it
I've tried to get under it
Stuck in between, it is what it is (Is what it is)
Bye-bye for now
I'll keep holdin' you down (Holdin' you down)
You'd do it for me, you'd do it for me (It is what it is)

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
'Til it ain't
Things will never be the same
Never be the same again
Everything so strange (Strange)
It ain't a game no more (A game no more, woah)
We were just gettin' lifted
Yesterday, yesterday
Now we just reminiscin'
On yesterday, yesterday
Keep my head above water (Head above water)
My eyes gettin' bigger (Eyes gettin' bigger), the world gettin' smaller
I been gettin' richer, only made me crazy (Crazy)
Mama said I'm different (Oh yeah), since I was a baby (Baby)

[Verse 2: Lil B]
My emotions
Gimme a sip of that potion
No, my heart is not broken
But I feel like it's open
Please, somebody, do surgery
Tell the doctor come work with me
I keep lookin' at my soul
Prayin', but only God knows
And I've been workin' nine to nine
Yeah
But they talk about it
But you know it's all fine (All fine)
But who can say that?
I would be the man of your dreams
I will do all that I can
And be all I can be

[Chorus: Thundercat]
I'll keep holdin' you down (Holdin' you down)
Even though you're not around (You're not around)
So hard to get over it
I've tried to get under it
Stuck in between, it is what it is (Is what it is)
Bye-bye for now
I'll keep holdin' you down (Holdin' you down)
You'd do it for me, you'd do it for me

[Verse]
Sometimes, existential dread
Comes ringin' through loud and clear
I'll adjust and simply let go
I guess it is what it is (Is)
I'm not sure of what's coming next
But I'll be alright as long as I keep breathin'
I know I'll be alright
I know I'll be alright

[Part 1]

[Verse 1]
When the gold becomes dough and the magic starts to fade
When it all comes to an end
When there's nothing left to say
It is what it is
I tried to make it work
My best just wasn't enough
It couldn't be helped, the end
The things I would do for you

[Verse 2]
After all is said and done
And I'm all alone
When I sit back and reflect
From a broken heart
Sometimes there's regret
It is what it is
It couldn't be helped, the end
So many things I wanna say
This is the end

[Part 2]

[Intro]
Hey, Mac (Woah)

[Verse 4: Childish Gambino]
We don't talk, then we feel safe
Each one of us with tiny, tiny, tiny screens
I've been runnin', I've been runnin' like a soul, woo
Sweatin' on 'em, now the beat gon' breathe
But I keep hearin'
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop (Tell you what)
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop (Can't even imagine)
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop (Whatever I feel is real)
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, yeah, ayy, hey (It does not matter, I mean it)

[Intro]
Hitmaka

[Chorus: Rahky]
Yeah, I gave you more than you wanted
I gave you more than you needed
So tell me, how does it feel
To lose the one you believe in

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I make you drop it on a Tuesday
I had the park on, poppin', we made a movie
So many feelings involved, the way you do me
Tell me you're ready and I'll just send the tour dates
Got one shot to do what it takes
Got no time for no mistakes
I see the light 'cause I'm hazy (Yeah)
They tried to hold me, but they didn't

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Every time you text me
And by the time I'm replyin'
It's too late
Now I feel a way, way, yeah

[Chorus: Rahky & Chris Brown]
Oh, and I gave you more
I gave you more than you wanted
I gave you more than you needed
So tell me, how does it feel
To lose the one you believe in

[Verse 2: Meek Mill & Rahky]
Yeah, I confess, I wasn't ready, but I was pressed
I was caught up in the lights from all the jets
All the pretty hoes, the X and Os, the diamonds, VVS
They was shinin', I was blinded, you was dope as CVS
What the fuck I was thinkin'?
The fuck I was drinkin'?
Runnin' 'round with these bitches
Our relationship sinkin' (Ooh)
Half a mill on her finger
Spent a Abraham Lincoln
Caught you textin' that nigga
I guess you gotta get even, damn
It was gettin' scarier
Your love was so superior
Never thought that I would see them times and I'd be tearin' up
Thinkin' 'bout the times of what we was and what we have now
We build again and I won't tear back down, I promise

[Chorus: Rahky]
Yeah, I gave you more than you wanted (Wanted, yeah)
I gave you more than you needed (Needed)
So tell me, how does it feel (How's it feel, baby?)
To lose the one you believe in

[Verse 3: Rahky]
Yeah, see that's the thing about trust
It's never been about us
'Cause we were doin' too much
We threw the rocks out apartments
Gave you the key where my heart be
You didn't say it, but you get it
You shouldn't hurt, but me but I let it

[Pre-Chorus: Rahky]
Every time I'm alone now
I feel like things are not the same
No, I feel a way, oh-oh
Every time you text me
And by the time I reply
It's too late
Something's gettin' in the way

[Chorus: Rahky, Chris Brown & Both]
Yeah, I gave you more than you wanted
I gave you more than you needed (Oh right)
So tell me, how does it feel
To lose the one you were leaving?

[Verse 1]
Down in the gutter an orphan boy
Has never been given a single joy
Making it breaking in, selling the loot
Hate in his eyes, a hole in his boot

[Chorus]
And all you wealthy folks
You drink your wine and you tell your jokes
You sermonize and it don’t ring true
Well there’s the door, away with you

[Verse 2]
And down in the street there’s an orphan girl
She’s never been given no love in the world
Making it selling her time in hotels
She never been one for the wedding bells

[Chorus]
And all you wealthy queens
Your servants and your limousines
You talk and you talk as if you knew
Well there’s the door, away with you

[Verse 3]
They walked into the room
They talked the terms a while
She pulled it off and heard him say
“Good lord, it’s been a while”
She told him not to worry
He told her not to ruse
She told him that it always goes the way it always do
And down on the 'vue below
The faces look the same
The town was frozen by the night
The streets were wet with rain
And after in the morning light
He found her arms were growing tired
He made to rise and she said no
She said, “Hold me close before you go”

[Chorus]
And all you wealthy folks
You drink your wine and you tell your jokes
You sermonize but you don’t know
What it’s like to live below
And all you orphan boys
And all you orphan girls
They will never lend a thing to you
So take what you can
Take all you can use

[Verse 1]
No time for coffee, mama
Send me on my way
You really were a charmer
I would’ve liked to stay

[Chorus]
I’m getting used to it now
I’m pretty used to it now
I’m getting used to it now
The feeling I’m pretty used

[Verse 2]
Let me buy you a round, man
So I can feel like a friend
You know it’s been too long, man
What’s goin on with your band?

[Chorus]
We’re getting used to it now
We’re pretty used to it now
We’re getting used to it now
The feeling we’re pretty used

[Verse 3]
And all the traveling harbors
On a traveling face
And I’m a lot like my father was
I’m always some other place
And everything that I call on
Doesn’t seem to obey
And everyone I can fall on
Well they don’t see it that way
And when I make my fortune
Lord, I’m gonna spend it in style
I’m gonna make em turn their heads
And when I make my amends
Lord, she will be first in line
I ain’t forgotten how she bled
Should be any moment now
I think I see her coming around
Lord, I let so many down
Lord, I turned so many loose

[Chorus]
No time for coffee, mama
Send me on my way
You really were a charmer
I would have liked to stay

[Verse 1]
I'm wide awake in the lobby of a hotel casino
An advertise of somewhere I wanted to be
The oxygen was choking like death grips around me
I even thought I couldn't be sadder than that
I am, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Hood on, hand in my pocket, walk away
Hood on, hand in my pocket, walk away

[Chorus]
Love me to death or don't give me anything
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Love me to death or don't give me anything
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Love me to death or don't give me anything
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
The elderly was playing a version of your song
I ask them if they could play anything else, but they don't
I sing along and laugh just in case of the opposite (Oh, no, oh, no)
Everything was blurry so I couldn't see
Thankfully, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Hood on, hand in my pocket, walk away (Walk away, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hood on, hand in my pocket, walk away

[Chorus]
Love me to death or don't give me anything
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Love me to death or don't give me anything
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Love me to death or don't give me anything
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
Come around like the moon, sun
Most the time you're on my mind
Come around like the moon, sun
Most the time you're on my mind
Come around like the moon, sun
Most the time you're on my mind
Come around like the moon, sun
Most the time you're on my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Hood on, hand in my pocket, walk away (Walk away, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hood on, hand in my pocket, walk away

[Chorus]
Love me to death or don't give me anything
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Love me to death or don't give me anything
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Love me to death or don't give me anything

[Outro]
When I see a call from Plano then I know that
I'll ignore ya for reasons that you don't know
In my mind, it's better to fantasize
So I'll buy a pack and sit back and look at the sky
Oh what are you gonna do
When there's a part of you that needs to run with the wind?

And the fire of burning yesterdays
Can only light the way
To lead you from the garden of the dark

Stay out of shadows, now
Looks like the change is on
Tomorrow's never gone
Today just never comes

Go on and jump, yeah
Into the hurricane
You will forget the pain
It's only there to exorcise your mind

Looking at the world
When you've opened up your eyes
You've got to see the promises they've made
They're bloody lies and broken dreams
Your silent screams
You're living in a time machine
And you can choose just who you are
Someone that you've never seen
Somewhere you've never been
You're living in a time machine




Oh what are you gonna do
When every part of you just needs to catch the wind?

And the fire of burning yesterdays
Can only light the way
To lead you from the garden of the dark

Looking for the world
When you've opened up your eyes
You'll see you've got invisible chains
They're only lies, not what it seems
I hear your silent screams

You're living in a time machine
Nobody cares just where you go
Taken where you've never been
Vacate to somewhere you don't know
Living in a time machine
Why do you stay who you are?
Be what you've never been
Someone you've never seen
You're living in a time machine
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Revolution in their minds, the children start to march
Against the world in which they have to live
And all the hate that's in their hearts
They're tired of being pushed around and told just what to do
They'll fight the world until they've won
And love comes flowing through, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today
Will the sunrise of tomorrow bring in peace in any way?
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear? Yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
So you children of the world, listen to what I say
If you want a better place to live in, spread the word today
Show the world that love is still alive, you must be brave
Or you children of today are children of the grave, yeah!

[Outro]
Children of the grave
Children of the grave
Across the desert of the burning dark, a
Darkness which illuminates you
There's a place you've always wanted to be
Whose pleasures always did escape you
It's always been so out of reach, nothing, so near
Ever felt so far
And now it's here within your grasp, a never
Ending burning says it all

As you drive into the darkness, in front the future
Behind you history
Caught alone in the dark night, do you think
That's the way it's supposed to be
You don't believe your eyes, cos all they see is
Lies, oh yeah

You better run from the holy man, the eyes that
Will are set up on you
Listen not to verse and prayer, songs that thrill
And voices tempt you
The inner flame has fear of death, never, has
Light ever seemed so dark
Pilgrims of sabbocracy, hear the hounds of
Heaven, as they bark
As you drive into the darkness, in front the future
Behind you history
Caught alone in the dark night, do you think
That's the way it's supposed to be
You don't believe your eyes, cos all they see is
Lies, oh yeah




I witness a time and a place that never dies, still
Frozen in time
This darkness the only place that I can hide, I
Witness, a dream

As you drive into the darkness, in front the future
Behind you history
Caught alone in the dark night, do you think
That's the way it's supposed to be
You don't believe your eyes, cos all they see is
Lies, oh yeah

I witness a time and a place that never dies, still
Frozen in time
This darkness the only place that I can hide, I
Witness, a dream
Oh, just a dream

[Verse 1]
Rocket engines burning fuel so fast
Up into the night sky they blast
Through the universe the engines whine
Could it be the end of man and time?
Back on earth the flame of life burns low
Everywhere is misery and woe
Pollution kills the air, the land and sea
Man prepares to meet his destiny, yeah

[Verse 2]
Rocket engines burning fuel so fast
Up into the black sky so vast
Burning metal through the atmosphere
Earth remains in worry, hate and fear
With the hateful battles raging on
Rockets flying to the glowing sun
Through the empires of eternal void
Freedom from the final suicide

[Bridge]
Freedom fighters sent out to the sun
Escape from brainwashed minds and pollution
Leave the earth to all its sin and hate
Find another world where freedom waits, yeah

[Verse 3]
Past the stars in fields of ancient void
Through the shields of darkness where they find
Love upon a land a world unknown
Where the sons of freedom make their home
Leave the earth to Satan and his slaves
Leave them to their future in their grave
Make a home where love is there to stay
Peace and happiness in every day

[Instrumental Outro]
Say you don't know me, you'll burn
You can refuse, but you'll lose, it's by me
Say you don't want me, you'll learn
Nothin' you do will be new, cause I'm through

Call me a liar, you knew
You were a fool, but that's cool, it's all right
Call me the Devil, it's true
Some can't accept but I crept inside you

So if a stranger calls you
Don't let him whisper his name
Cause it's Voodoo, oh

Fade into shadow, you'll burn
Your fortune is free, I can see it's no good
Never look back, never turn
It's a question of time 'till you're mine and you learn

So if a stranger sees you
Don't look in his eyes
Cause he's Voodoo
Say you don't know me, you'll burn
You can refuse, but you'll lose, it's by me
Say you don't want me, you'll learn
Nothing you do will be new, cause I'm through




Voodoo

Bring me your children, they'll burn
Never look back, never turn
Cry me a river, you'll learn Voodoo

[Intro]

[Riff]

[Verse 1]
What is this that stands before me?
Figure in black which points at me
Turn 'round quick and start to run
Find out I'm the chosen one
Oh, no!

[Verse 2]
Big black shape with eyes of fire
Telling people their desire
Satan's sitting there, he's smiling
Watches those flames get higher and higher
Oh, no, no, please, God, help me!

[Outro]
Is it the end, my friend?
Satan's coming 'round the bend
People running 'cause they're scared
The people better go and beware
No, no, please, no!
Mortal eyes, looking through a veil of dreams
Hypnotized, and ever living soul with wings
Think you're god, but you never had control
Think you're loved, but there's no one there at all...

My colours all ran dry, and now I see the world in
Black and white
It's too late now, it's time to kiss the rainbow
Goodbye

Poison tears running from a palsied face
Satan nears, descending on the human race
Think you're god, but you never had control
Think you're loved, but there's no one there at all...

My colours all ran dry, and now I see the world in
Black and white
It's too late now, it's time to kiss the rainbow
Goodbye

Listen to the wind, hear the gospel blow
Tell me that you don't hear what I'm hearing
And I will let you go
Look up to the sky, put your trust in me
Tell me that you ain't feelin' what I'm feelin' and I
Will set you free



Look into the flame, see the embers glow
Tell me that you don't see what I'm seein' and I
Will let you go
Look up at the sky, put your trust in me
Tell me that you ain't feelin' what I'm feelin' and I
Will set you free

Look into the flame, see the embers glow
Tell me that you don't see what I'm seein' and I
Will let you go
Taste the holy blood, runnin from my veins
Tell me that you ain't feelin' what I'm feelin' and
I'll take away the pain
Yes I will now, oh yes I will. It's time to kiss the
Rainbow goodbye

[Harmonica Intro]

[Verse 1]
Misty morning, clouds in the sky
Without warning, a wizard walks by
Casting his shadow, weaving his spell
Flowing clothes, tinkling bell

[Chorus]
Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic

[Verse 2]
Evil power disappears
Demons worry when the wizard is near
He turns tears into joy
Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by

[Chorus]
Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic

[Verse 3]
Sun is shining, clouds have gone by
All the people give a happy sigh
He has passed by, giving his sign
Left all the people feeling so fine

[Chorus]
Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic
Don't come closer, because it ain't safe here
Just turn around now and walk away
I've gotta tell you, there are no rules here
Sometimes I wonder, what goes on there
Behind those eyes

[Hook]
When a promise is broken, and no one trusts you
Young ones crying with there heads in their hands
When you talk about saving, the souls of the faithful
You can't help thinking you've got blood on your
Hands
From a cross of thorns

Tongues of fire always talking, wasted words that
Ring in my ears
We're still waiting, losing patience. Will all the lies
Of, 400 years
I've got to tell you, there are no rules here
Sometimes I wonder
What goes on there, behind those eyes

[Hook]
When a promise is broken, and no one trusts you
Young ones crying with there heads in their hands
When you talk about saving, the souls of the faithful
You can't help thinking you've got blood on your
Hands from a cross of thorns




We gave you yesterdays, and now you want to-day
Oh, from the hands of death we take our daily bread
Now all we do is choke, and the words that you once
Spoke, fade away
Look at what you've done, oh, it's a cross of thorns

Take away, this cross of thorns, look at what you've
Done
It's a cross of thorns, cross of thorns
When a promise is broken, and no one trusts you
You've got blood on your hands, from a cross of
Thorns

[Verse 1]
Take me through the centuries to supersonic years
Electrifying enemy is drowning in his tears
All I have to give you is a love that never dies
The symptom of the universe is written in your eyes
Yeah! Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Mother Moon, she’s calling me back to her silver womb
Father of creation takes me from my stolen tomb
Seventh Advent unicorn is waiting in the skies
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies
Yeah! Yeah!

[Verse 3]
Take my hand, my child of love, come step inside my tears
Swim the magic ocean I’ve been crying all these years
With our love, we’ll ride away into eternal skies
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies
Yeah! Yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Woman child of love’s creation
Come and step inside my dreams
In your eyes, I see no sadness
You are all that loving means
Take my hand, and we’ll go riding
Through the sunshine from above
We’ll find happiness together
In the summer skies of love
Look through the people, and on through the mist
To the hill of the headless cross
Where all witches meet, on a night such as this
And the power of darkness is host
They come face to face, eye to eye, soul to soul
With an Angel that fell from the sky
Borne on the air, are the screams and the wails
Of the masses appointed to die

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture
At the headless cross, at the headless cross

From the first evil night, when a black flash of light
Cut the crucifix half to the ground
There's been no escape from the power of Satan
On a nation so brave and so proud

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture
At the headless cross, at the headless cross
How do you feel, when the locks refuse the key
And the master is calling your name
Does the luck of the charm, really keep you from harm
Does the talisman protect you from pain




Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture
At the headless cross, at the headless cross

From the first evil night, when a black flash of light
Cut the crucifix half to the ground
There's no escaping from the power of Satan
For a people so brave and so proud

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture
At the headless cross, at the headless cross
At the headless cross, at the headless cross

Where will you run to, at the headless cross
Look, to the headless cross

[Guitar Intro]

[Verse 1]
Finished with my woman, 'cause she couldn't help me
With my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frowning
All the time

[Verse 2]
All day long, I think of things, but nothing seems
To satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something
To pacify

[Chorus]
Can you help me
Occupy my brain?
Oh, yeah!

[Verse 3]
I need someone to show me the things in life
That I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh
And I will cry
Happiness, I cannot feel and love, to me
Is so unreal

[Verse 5]
And so, as you hear these words telling you now
Of my state
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could
But it's too late

[Verse 1]
Sing me a song, you're a singer
Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil
The Devil is never a maker
The less that you give, you're a taker

[Chorus]
So, it's on and on and on
It's Heaven and Hell, oh well, yeah

[Verse 2]
The lover of life's not a sinner
The ending is just a beginner
The closer you get to the meaning
The sooner you'll know that you're dreaming

[Chorus]
So, it's on and on and on
Oh, it's on and on and on
It goes on and on and on
Heaven and Hell, I can tell
Fool, fool

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Yeah-yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Well, if it seems to be real, it's illusion
For every moment of truth, there's confusion in life
Love can be seen as the answer
But nobody bleeds for the dancer

[Chorus]
And it's on and on, on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
They say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you gotta ride it well
The world is full of Kings and Queens
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams
It's Heaven and Hell, oh well
And they'll tell you black is really white
The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's Heaven and Hell, oh no!
Fool, fool!
You've got to bleed for the dancer!
Fool, fool!
Look for the answer!
Fool, fool, fool!

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
I am Iron Man!

[Verse 1]
Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves will he fall?

[Verse 2]
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

[Verse 3]
He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

[Verse 4]
Now, the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now, he has his revenge

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again!

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
You seen life through distorted eyes, you know you had to learn
The execution of your mind, you really had to turn
The race is run, the book is read, the end begins to show
The truth is out, the lies are old, but you don't want to know

[Chorus]
Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies

[Verse 2]
The people who have crippled you, you wanna see them burn
The gates of life have closed on you and there's just no return
You're wishing that the hands of doom could take your mind away
And you don't care if you don't see again the light of day

[Chorus]
Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies, you bastards!

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Where can you run to? What more can you do?
No more tomorrow, life is killing you
Dreams turn to nightmares, Heaven turns to Hell
Burnt out confusion, nothing more to tell, yeah
Everything around you, what's it coming to
God knows as your dog nose, bog blast all of you
Sabbath, bloody sabbath, nothing more to do
Living just for dying, dying just for you, yeah

[Instrumental Outro]

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcerers of death's construction
In the fields, the bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Oh, Lord, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that all to the poor, yeah!
Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait till their judgment day comes, yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Now, in darkness, world stops turning
Ashes where their bodies burning
No more war pigs have the power
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of Judgment, God is calling
On their knees, the war pigs crawling
Begging mercies for their sins
Satan, laughing, spreads his wings
Oh, Lord, yeah!

[Outro: "Luke's Wall"]

[Verse 1]
Oh no, here it comes again
Can't remember when we came so close to love before
Hold on, good things never last
Nothing's in the past, it always seems to come again
Again and again, again and again, and again

[Verse 2]
Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Captain's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights

[Bridge]
Circles and rings, dragons and kings
Weaving a charm and a spell
Blessed by the night, holy and bright
Called by the toll of the bell
Bloodied angels fast descending
Moving on a never-bending light
Phantom figures free forever
Out of shadows, shining ever-bright

[Refrain]
Neon Knights!
Neon Knights!
All right!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Captain's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights
Again and again, again and again, and again

[Refrain]
Neon Knights!
Neon Knights!
Neon Knights!
All right!

[Verse]
Oh yeah!
Some people say my love cannot be true
Please believe me, my love, and I'll show you
I will give you those things you thought unreal
The sun, the moon, the stars all bear my seal

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh yeah!
Follow me now and you will not regret
Leaving the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
Forever with me 'til the end of time

[Chorus]
Your love for me has just got to be real
Before you know the way I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel

[Post-Chorus]
Oh yeah!
Now, I have you with me, under my power
Our love grows stronger, now, with every hour
Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am
My name is Lucifer, please take my hand

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh yeah!
Follow me now and you will not regret
Leaving the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
Forever with me 'til the end of time

[Chorus]
Your love for me has just got to be real
Before you know the way I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel

[Post-Chorus]
Oh yeah!
Now, I have you with me, under my power
Our love grows stronger, now, with every hour
Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am
My name is Lucifer, please take my hand

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
In the misty morning, on the edge of time
We've lost the rising sun, a final sign
As the misty morning rolls away to die
Reaching for the stars, we blind the sky

[Verse 1]
We sailed across the air before we learned to fly
We thought that it could never end
We'd glide above the ground before we learned to run, run
Now it seems our world has come undone

[Chorus]
Oh, they say that it's over
And it just had to be
Oh, they say that it's over
We're lost children of the sea
Oh, woah!

[Verse 2]
We made the mountains shake with laughter as we played
Hiding in our corner of the world
Then we did the demon dance and rushed to nevermore
Threw away the key and locked the door

[Chorus]
Oh, they say that it's over, yeah
And it just had to be
Yes, they say that it's over
We're lost children of the sea
Oh!

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
In the misty morning, on the edge of time
We've lost the rising sun, a final sign
As the misty morning rolls away to die
Reaching for the stars, we blind the sky

[Chorus]
Oh, they say that it's over
And it just had to be
Oh, they say that it's over
Poor lost children of the sea
Yeah!

[Outro]
Look out! The sky is falling down!
Look out! The world is spinning round and round and round!
Look out! The sun is going black, black!
Look out! It's never never never coming back, look out!

[Intro]

[Riff]

[Verse 1]
What is this that stands before me?
Figure in black which points at me
Turn 'round quick and start to run
Find out I'm the chosen one
Oh, no!

[Verse 2]
Big black shape with eyes of fire
Telling people their desire
Satan's sitting there, he's smiling
Watches those flames get higher and higher
Oh, no, no, please, God, help me!

[Outro]
Is it the end, my friend?
Satan's coming 'round the bend
People running 'cause they're scared
The people better go and beware
No, no, please, no!

[Intro]
I am Iron Man!

[Verse 1]
Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves will he fall?

[Verse 2]
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

[Verse 3]
He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

[Verse 4]
Now, the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now, he has his revenge

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again!

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Close the city and tell the people that
Something's coming to call
Death and darkness are rushing forward to
Take a bite from the wall, oh
You've nothing to say
They're breaking away

[Hook]
If you listen to fools
The mob rules
The mob rules

[Verse 2]
Kill the spirit and you'll be blinded
The end is always the same
Play with fire, you burn your fingers and
Lose your hold of the flame, oh
It's over, it's done
The end is begun

[Hook]
If you listen to fools
The mob rules

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
You've nothing to say
Oh, they're breaking away
If you listen to fools

[Verse 3]
Break the circle and stop the movement
The wheel is thrown to the ground
Just remember it might start rolling and
Take you right back around

[Outro]
You're all fools
The mob rules

[Verse 1]
Revolution in their minds, the children start to march
Against the world in which they have to live
And all the hate that's in their hearts
They're tired of being pushed around and told just what to do
They'll fight the world until they've won
And love comes flowing through, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today
Will the sunrise of tomorrow bring in peace in any way?
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear? Yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
So you children of the world, listen to what I say
If you want a better place to live in, spread the word today
Show the world that love is still alive, you must be brave
Or you children of today are children of the grave, yeah!

[Outro]
Children of the grave
Children of the grave

[Verse 1]
Sing me a song, you're a singer
Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil
The Devil is never a maker
The less that you give, you're a taker

[Chorus]
So, it's on and on and on
It's Heaven and Hell, oh well, yeah

[Verse 2]
The lover of life's not a sinner
The ending is just a beginner
The closer you get to the meaning
The sooner you'll know that you're dreaming

[Chorus]
So, it's on and on and on
Oh, it's on and on and on
It goes on and on and on
Heaven and Hell, I can tell
Fool, fool

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Yeah-yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Well, if it seems to be real, it's illusion
For every moment of truth, there's confusion in life
Love can be seen as the answer
But nobody bleeds for the dancer

[Chorus]
And it's on and on, on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
They say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you gotta ride it well
The world is full of Kings and Queens
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams
It's Heaven and Hell, oh well
And they'll tell you black is really white
The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's Heaven and Hell, oh no!
Fool, fool!
You've got to bleed for the dancer!
Fool, fool!
Look for the answer!
Fool, fool, fool!

[Instrumental Outro]

[Guitar Intro]

[Verse 1]
Finished with my woman, 'cause she couldn't help me
With my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frowning
All the time

[Verse 2]
All day long, I think of things, but nothing seems
To satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something
To pacify

[Chorus]
Can you help me
Occupy my brain?
Oh, yeah!

[Verse 3]
I need someone to show me the things in life
That I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh
And I will cry
Happiness, I cannot feel and love, to me
Is so unreal

[Verse 5]
And so, as you hear these words telling you now
Of my state
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could
But it's too late

You don't know just why you hate this someone
But you wanna know why you spilled your wine

You're so afraid to damage your image
Ask forgiveness, not for permission
You can't erase us, it's already written
Baby, you did forget that meaning, meaning, meaning
I don't wanna be your everything
'Cause I don't wanna leave you with nothing
I don't wanna be your everything
'Cause I don't wanna leave you with nothing

[Chorus]
Microdosing
I was just microdosing you

[Intro]
I'm dreamin'
Ayy

Truth be told, I got the hardest ahead, yeah
But I said I'd never let it get to my head
I be in space in a daze while you tellin' me things
I see your face but I never really hear what you say
Red light, green light, either way I'ma go
New place, corner store ain't that close anymore
Yeah, let me get the greens, I'll be home by four
If you wanna pour up, then I need me a four
Yeah, anything less, ain't gon' hit to the core
I mean, anything less, you can leave it at home
I mean, anything less, you can take it to go
I mean, anything less, any-anything less

More fish in the sea, but see, I don't go fishin', yeah
So if you want it, then you gotta come and get it, yeah
Like my ends, baby girl, we need to split up
She said, "I get crazy when I start to get my drink on"
Ah, told the bitch I wasn't fucked up off the liquor
Where the fuck you goin'?
We go way away for a mini-retreat
We go to space, spaceship, in the back of the seat
I walk around, fuck around while you fuckin' with me
I'm dazin' out when I start to hear the sound of the beat

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, daydreamin'
Hey, daydreamin'
Daydreamin', daydreamin'
Daydreamin', -min'
Daydreamin', -min'
Hey

[Verse]
No pigmentation, giving you the blues
Suffering from FOMO, she could come, too
Screaming out YOLO,  jumping off the roof
One more drink, one less I'll (Lose)
She's betting on science, she say she needs proof
If I was out of my body, you would see the truth
And my brains bruised from all of the bad news
And my brains bruised from all of the bad news
Lost her only son and he wasn't even three
Now try telling her that everything is meant to be
It's hard to believe a vision you can't see
But tell me, have you looked at the air that you breathe?
The balance in me split by three
I sold my mind and my flesh
They don't get the context 'cause it's too complex
I was in my highest, I was in my high

[Chorus]
Said, oh, I'll never know
How long I'll stay, how far I'll go
Said, oh, I'll never know
How long I'll stay, how far I'll go

[Outro]
Astronaut
Answer now like an astronaut
Get alcohol like an astronaut
Area code like astronaut, yeah-yeah
Tragedy
You turned a good thing to a tragedy
Being held down by gravity
Baby, hoping you can see the map
Good night to all of you, wherever you are

[Interlude]
I prefer the pain, you tellin' me
I know you haven't said a prayer in a month or so
You givin' up your faith for some fun, yeah
I don't feel the rain or the sun, no (Oh-oh)
Not the sun, no, not the sun, no
Not the sun, no, not the sun, no
Feeling safe with your love song
She feeling safe with your love song
Girl, I'm in love, hope you feelin' in love, too

[Intro]
Mhm, mhm
When you take the shot, babe
Look me in my eyes before you sip it
When you take this off
I can't even lie, I be lookin'
We could lock it up

[Verse 1]
I be feelin' free in your prison
Something I never had
And then I start to wonder, oh
Something I'll never have
And then I start to wonder
Why can't I feel it with another?
And then I start to wonder
Why can't I see it with another?
Yeah, maybe she's a lockdown lover, oh-oh, oh, hey, yeah
Maybe she's lock down, oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
And I'm screamin', "Fuck sleep"
I'ma need you til' my knees weak
In a week need you terminal B
Need you to hold me, oh-oh
Yeah
And I'm rushing home
(I was hiding inside what I felt, I felt like)
I feel it
I feel, hmm
(This isn't what you see if you-, if you're looking at it 

[?])

[Verse 2]
I felt this once before
What if she's a lockdown lover?
What if she never leave me for real?
And then I start to wonder
Why can't I feel this with another? Yeah
And yeah, maybe she just wanna be free for the night
But don't you fall in love with my baby
We're all born to die, so really nobody's safe here
I get so long
That your bitch she’s feeling for more
We could all squeeze up in this four-door

[Outro]
I was, I was hopin' to be alone
But I've realized at the time that
That I did it for you
Like I needed you, I needed to talk and you receive it
I wasn’t...it wasn’t perfect, but you see...
I felt this once before
Consider...consider it all

[?]

[?]
I felt this once before
I was born in the canebrakes
Raised up in the lion's den
I was born in the canebrakes
Raised up in the lion's den

Don't wanna hurt you, baby
Wanna use you for my friend

Well, you let that be your secret
Keep that to your natural self
Well, you let that be your secret
Keep that to your natural self

Don't you tell your friend now
Please don't tell nobody else

You can shake, you can shim, sham, shimmy
Shake your money, baby, all night long
You can shake, you can shim, sham, shimmy
Shake your money baby all night long
Poor boy may be crazy
Well, I do know right from wrong

You better watch your woman now
She 'bout to get down in a fix
Yeah, you better watch your woman now
She's 'bout to get down in her fix

I'd rather be way out in the jungle
With nothing but a rock and stick, mmm
Man, I'd rather be way out in the jungle
With nothing but a rock and stick, mmm
I've just got to forget you
That's one thing I've got to do
Oh, I know you don't love me
Half as much as I loved you

Just got to leave you
And start all over anew
One day I'll find
Someone on down the line
To help me forget about you

It won't be easy
To get you off of my mind
Oh, one day you'll be
Just a fading memory
It's just a matter of time

I've just got to leave you, darling
I've just got to put you down
I know you're no good for me, darling
I've just got to, I've just got to put you down
I want to know, I want to know, I just got to know
Why do you always play around?
If you, if you have the same feeling for me
Then why don't you settle down?

I want to know
I want to know, I just got to know

I think you want me for conveniency
If I'm wrong, please tell me right
I know, I know I been in the dark for a long time
But someday I'll see the light

And I want to know
I want to know, I just got to know

It takes you to prove you love me
You can prove it sure as the world is round
But from, but from your ways and actions
I have a feeling you have let me down
I want to know
I want to know, I just got to know

It takes you to prove you love me
You can prove it sure as the world is round
But from, but from your ways and actions
I have a feeling you have let me down

I want to know
I want to know, I just got to know

And I want to know
I want to know, I just got to know
Every time I see you walkin'
I get a temperature 110
Every time I see you walkin'
I get a temperature 110
When you catch yourself cooling down
You heat right up again

I know you been to college
Got about a 110 degrees
I know you been to college
Got about a 110 degrees
So I know you got the knowledge
To give my poor heart ease

See you runnin' so hot now
Like a radiator
See you runnin' so hot now
Like a radiator
Movin' all the other fine chicks now
In the incubator
Every time I see you walkin'
I get a temperature 110
Every time I see you walkin'
I get a temperature 110
Now you catch yourself cooling down
You heat right up again
Well, now I found me a girl, it's a wonderful thing
I'm a-wearin' this smile, she's a-wearin' my ring
She's like a talisman, some kind of mystical pearl
She's my dark angel, my blue-eyed girl

Well, it could have gone wrong, and maybe even right
There's some kind of things a man can't fight
Amongst her shores, I'm all swept away
I ask her "what's your name", she said "call me Miss Night and Day"

That girl can roll with me now, roll till the break of day
She can roll like she wanna, any ol' kind of way
When she go rockin' round the clock, I call her Little Miss Night and Day

Sometimes she will, sometimes she won't
About the time she should, that's the time she don't
She's like the moon, never ever stay one way
She got the rhythm and the blues, you got to love Miss Night and Day

Well, it might come heads, might be tails
But you go acting the fool, she'll run you off of the rails
And then she smiles in that mischievous way
That's when I call her my flame, her name is Little Miss Night and Day
Well, she's cool under fire, she can cover and duck
You think you got her in range, oh well, good luck
She's my shotgun lover on that long highway
She keeps her eye on the street kids, they call her Miss Night and Day

She can roll with you, buddy, she can roll with you, girl
And roll it on down the line
If she's not battin' a thousand, she's hittin' nine-ninety-nine

She's a mean mistreater, and my dungaree doll
She's a gone little queenie, and that ain't all
She puts the top down, we're on the town, drivin' them blues away
Locked down and loaded, Miss Night and Day

You better roll with me, girl, you better roll with me, honey
You better roll with me, child, come on and roll with now
She keep me rockin' round the world, my Little Miss Night and Day
I went out in Virginia, honey, where the green grass grows
I went out in Virginia, honey, where the green grass grows
I try to tell myself that I didn't love you no more

My baby told me, "Honey, stop doin' me wrong!"
My baby told me, "Honey, stop doin' me wrong!"
Well, I'm feeling you, baby, 'cause I'm tired of living alone

Well, I can't help feeling, I know I'm doin' you wrong
Well, I can't help feeling, I know I'm doin' you wrong
That's why I came beggin', I'm a one man standing alone

Way out in Virginia, honey, where the green grass grows
Way out in Virginia, honey, where the green grass grows
I try to tell myself that I didn't want you no more

Well, I'm feeling you, baby, 'cause I'm tired of living alone
First time I saw you, you had that look in your eye
Don't play me cheap, girl, 'cause you know I'm not shy
You always walkin' and you talkin' some stuff
I found out last night, well, I had enough

You're always tryin' to tell me some lie
Don't know why you're always trying to tell a lie

I call you last night on the phone
I left a message after the tone
You sister told me you'd be back soon
I saw you next day, in the afternoon

You're always tryin' to tell me your lies
I don't know why you're always trying to tell me some lie

First day you told me your name was Elaine
Next day I found out it really was Jane
You gonna teach me water goes uphill
There ain't no greenback on a dollar bill
Always gonna to try to sell me lies
Don't know why you're always trying to tell a lie

You got a lie on your lie
A trick on your trick
It's only in your own mind
That you get away slick

We saw you standing at the scene of the crime
You tried to play it off, said you weren't there at the time
Whatever happens to come from your lips
I'm only saying that I won't trip

You're always gonna try to tell a lie
Don't know why you're always trying to tell some lie

I call last night again on the phone
I left a message after the tone
You sister told me you had a bad cough
Your boss will hire you right back, you just got laid off

Always trying to tell me your lie
I don't know why you're always trying to sell me some lie
Don't know why you're always sayin' something you don't really mean
Something extreme
It's always got to be your lies
When I needed you
To stand by my side
All you did was
Laugh while I cried
Now you want me
To take you back in my arms
Oh, it's too late, baby
I'm here to tell you that the feeling is gone

I remember
The look on your face
Whoa, when you told me
That I was being replaced
And now you're begging me
You say you wanna come back home
Oh, it's too late, baby
I'm standing here to tell you that the feeling is gone

You told me to hit the road
And I did just that
Now you found out that you need me
Whoa, I ain't coming back
Now you say you want me
To take you back in my arms
Oh, I said it's too late, baby
Lord, I tell you the feeling is gone

[Verse 1]
Visions cupped within the flower
Deadly petals with strange power
Faces shine a deadly smile
Look upon you at your trial
Chill that numbs from head to toe
Icy sun with frosty glow
Words that glow read to your sorrow
Words that go read, "no tomorrow"

[Bridge]
Feel your spirit rise with the breeze
Feel your body falling to its knees
Take your wall of remorse
Turns your body to a corpse
Turns your body to a corpse
Turns your body to a corpse
Sleeping wall of remorse
Turns your body to a corpse

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Now from darkness, there springs light
Wall of sleep is cool and bright
Wall of sleep is lying broken
Sun shines in, you have awoken

[Verse 1]
Visions cupped within the flower
Deadly petals with strange power
Faces shine a deadly smile
Look upon you at your trial
Chill that numbs from head to toe
Icy sun with frosty glow
Words that glow read to your sorrow
Words that go read, "no tomorrow"

[Bridge]
Feel your spirit rise with the breeze
Feel your body falling to its knees
Take your wall of remorse
Turns your body to a corpse
Turns your body to a corpse
Turns your body to a corpse
Sleeping wall of remorse
Turns your body to a corpse

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Now from darkness, there springs light
Wall of sleep is cool and bright
Wall of sleep is lying broken
Sun shines in, you have awoken

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcerers of death's construction
In the fields, the bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Oh, Lord, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that all to the poor, yeah!
Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait till their judgment day comes, yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Now, in darkness, world stops turning
Ashes where their bodies burning
No more war pigs have the power
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of Judgment, God is calling
On their knees, the war pigs crawling
Begging mercies for their sins
Satan, laughing, spreads his wings
Oh, Lord, yeah!

[Outro: "Luke's Wall"]

[Bass Instrumental: Bassically]

[Verse]
Oh yeah!
Some people say my love cannot be true
Please believe me, my love, and I'll show you
I will give you those things you thought unreal
The sun, the moon, the stars all bear my seal

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh yeah!
Follow me now and you will not regret
Leaving the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
Forever with me ’til the end of time

[Chorus]
Your love for me has just got to be real
Before you know the way I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel
I’m going to feel

[Post-Chorus]
Oh yeah!
Now, I have you with me, under my power
Our love grows stronger, now, with every hour
Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am
My name is Lucifer, please take my hand

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh yeah!
Follow me now and you will not regret
Leaving the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
Forever with me 'til the end of time

[Chorus]
Your love for me has just got to be real
Before you know the way I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel

[Post-Chorus]
Oh yeah!
Now, I have you with me, under my power
Our love grows stronger, now, with every hour
Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am
My name is Lucifer, please take my hand

[Instrumental Outro]

[Instrumental Intro: "Jack, the Stripper"]

[Verse]
Goin' home, late last night
Suddenly, I got a fright
Yeah, I looked through a window
And surprised what I saw
Fairy with boots and dancin' with a dwarf
Alright, now!

[Chorus]
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah, I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes
Alright, now!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah, I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes
Alright, now!

[Outro]
So, I went to the doctor, see what he could give me
He said, “Son; son, you’ve gone too far
'Cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do”
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Reflex in the sky
Warn you you're gonna die
Storm coming, you better hide
From the atomic tide
Flashes in the sky
Turns houses into sties
Turns people into clay
Radiation, minds decay

[Verse 2]
Robot minds of robot slaves
Lead them to atomic graves
Plastic flowers, melting sun
Fading moon falls upon
Dying world of radiation
Victims of mad frustration
Burning globe of obscene fire
Like electric funeral pyre

[Bridge]
Buildings crashing down
To earth’s cracking ground
Rivers turn to wood
Ice melt into blood
Earth lies in deathbed
Clouds cry for the dead
Terrifying rain
Is a burning pain
(Electric Funeral)
(Electric Funeral)
(Electric Funeral)
(Electric Funeral)

[Verse 3]
And so, in the sky
Shines the electric eye
Supernatural king
Takes Earth under his wing
Heaven's golden chorus sings
Hell's angels flap their wings
Evil souls fall to Hell
Ever trapped in burning cells

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
*Coughing*

[Verse 1]
Alright now
Won't you listen?
When I first met you, didn't realize
I can't forget you or your surprise
You introduced me to my mind
And left me wanting you and your kind
Oh, yeah!

[Verse 2]
I love you
Oh, you know it
My life was empty, forever on a down
Until you took me, showed me around
My life is free now, my life is clear
I love you, sweet leaf, though you can't hear
Oh, yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Come on now
Try it out
Straight people don't know what you're about
They put you down and shut you out
You gave to me a new belief
And soon the world will love you, sweet leaf
Oh, yeah, baby!

[Outro]
Come on now! Oh, yeah!
Try me out, baby! Alright!
Oh, yeah-ah! I want you part of this sweet leaf!
Oh, yeah! Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, try-y me-e o-out
I love you, sweet leaf, oh

[Verse 1]
Sorcerers of madness selling me their time
Child of God sitting in the sun, giving peace of mind
Fictional seduction on a black-snow sky
Sadness kills the superman, even fathers cry

[Chorus]
Of all the things I value most of all
I look inside myself and see
My world and know that it is good
You know that I should

[Verse 2]
Superstitious century, didn’t time go slow
Separating sanity, watching children grow
Synchronated undertaker, spiral skies
Silver ships on plasmic oceans in disguise

[Chorus]
Of all the things I value most in life
I see my memories and feel their warmth
And know that they are good
You know that I should

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Watching eyes of celluloid tell you how to live
Metaphoric motor-replay, give, give, give!
Laughter kissing love is showing me the way
Spiral city architect, I build, you pay

[Chorus]
Of all the things I value most of all
I look upon my earth and feel the warmth
And know that it is good
You know that I should
You know that I should
You know that I should
You know that I should

[Verse 1]
Rocket engines burning fuel so fast
Up into the night sky they blast
Through the universe the engines whine
Could it be the end of man and time?
Back on earth the flame of life burns low
Everywhere is misery and woe
Pollution kills the air, the land and sea
Man prepares to meet his destiny, yeah

[Verse 2]
Rocket engines burning fuel so fast
Up into the black sky so vast
Burning metal through the atmosphere
Earth remains in worry, hate and fear
With the hateful battles raging on
Rockets flying to the glowing sun
Through the empires of eternal void
Freedom from the final suicide

[Bridge]
Freedom fighters sent out to the sun
Escape from brainwashed minds and pollution
Leave the earth to all its sin and hate
Find another world where freedom waits, yeah

[Verse 3]
Past the stars in fields of ancient void
Through the shields of darkness where they find
Love upon a land a world unknown
Where the sons of freedom make their home
Leave the earth to Satan and his slaves
Leave them to their future in their grave
Make a home where love is there to stay
Peace and happiness in every day

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
What you get and what you see
Things that don’t come easily
Feeling happy in my pain
Icicles within my brain (Cocaine)

[Verse 2]
Something blowing in my head
Winds of ice that soon will spread
Down to freeze my very soul
Makes me happy, makes me cold

[Chorus]
My eyes are blind, but I can see
The snowflakes glisten on the tree
The sun no longer sets me free
I feel the snowflakes freezing me

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Let the winter sunshine on
Let me feel the frost of dawn
Build my dreams on flakes of snow
Soon I’ll feel the chilling glow

[Bridge]
Right!
Don’t you think I know what I’m doing
Don’t tell me that it’s doing me wrong
You’re the one that’s really the loser
This is where I feel I belong
Right!

[Verse 4]
Kiss the world with winter flowers
Turn my days to frozen hours
Lying snowblind in the sun
Will my ice age ever come?

[Verse 1]
You seen life through distorted eyes, you know you had to learn
The execution of your mind, you really had to turn
The race is run, the book is read, the end begins to show
The truth is out, the lies are old, but you don't want to know

[Chorus]
Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies

[Verse 2]
The people who have crippled you, you wanna see them burn
The gates of life have closed on you and there's just no return
You're wishing that the hands of doom could take your mind away
And you don't care if you don't see again the light of day

[Chorus]
Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies, you bastards!

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Where can you run to? What more can you do?
No more tomorrow, life is killing you
Dreams turn to nightmares, Heaven turns to Hell
Burnt out confusion, nothing more to tell, yeah
Everything around you, what's it coming to
God knows as your dog nose, bog blast all of you
Sabbath, bloody sabbath, nothing more to do
Living just for dying, dying just for you, yeah

[Instrumental Outro]

[instrumental]

[Verse 1]
You're searching for your mind, don't know where to start
Can't find the key to fit the lock on your heart
You think you know, but you are never quite sure
Your soul is ill, but you will not find a cure, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Your world was made for you by someone above
But you choose evil ways instead of love
You made me master of the world where you exist
The soul I took from you was not even missed, yeah!

[Bridge]
Lord of this world
Evil possessor
Lord of this world
He's your confessor now

[Verse 3]
You think you're innocent, you've nothing to fear
You don't know me you say, but isn't it clear?
You turn to me in all your worldly greed and pride
But will you turn to me when it's your turn to die? Yeah!

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
The neon lights are shinin' on me again
I walk the lonely streets in search of a friend
I need a lady to help me to get through the night
Through the night
If I could find her then everything would be alright

[Verse 2]
The sleepy city is dreamin' the night time away
Out on the street, I watch tomorrow becomin' today
I see a man, he's got take away women for sale
Yes, for sale
Guess that's the answer, 'cause take away women don't fail

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh, dirty women, they don't mess around
Oh, dirty women, they don't mess around
You've got me comin', you've got me goin' around
Oh, dirty women, they don't mess around

[Outro]
Walkin' the streets I wonder will it ever happen (dirty women)
Gotta be good 'cause then everything will be okay (dirty women)
If I could score tonight then I will end up happy (dirty women)
A woman for sale is gonna help me save my day (dirty women)
(Dirty women, dirty women, dirty women, dirty women...)

[Intro]

[Riff]

[Verse 1]
What is this that stands before me?
Figure in black which points at me
Turn 'round quick and start to run
Find out I'm the chosen one
Oh, no!

[Verse 2]
Big black shape with eyes of fire
Telling people their desire
Satan's sitting there, he's smiling
Watches those flames get higher and higher
Oh, no, no, please, God, help me!

[Outro]
Is it the end, my friend?
Satan's coming 'round the bend
People running 'cause they're scared
The people better go and beware
No, no, please, no!

[Intro]
I am Iron Man!

[Verse 1]
Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves will he fall?

[Verse 2]
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

[Verse 3]
He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

[Verse 4]
Now, the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now, he has his revenge

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again!

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Revolution in their minds, the children start to march
Against the world in which they have to live
And all the hate that's in their hearts
They're tired of being pushed around and told just what to do
They'll fight the world until they've won
And love comes flowing through, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today
Will the sunrise of tomorrow bring in peace in any way?
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear? Yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
So you children of the world, listen to what I say
If you want a better place to live in, spread the word today
Show the world that love is still alive, you must be brave
Or you children of today are children of the grave, yeah!

[Outro]
Children of the grave
Children of the grave

[Guitar Intro]

[Verse 1]
Finished with my woman, 'cause she couldn't help me
With my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frowning
All the time

[Verse 2]
All day long, I think of things, but nothing seems
To satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something
To pacify

[Chorus]
Can you help me
Occupy my brain?
Oh, yeah!

[Verse 3]
I need someone to show me the things in life
That I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh
And I will cry
Happiness, I cannot feel and love, to me
Is so unreal

[Verse 5]
And so, as you hear these words telling you now
Of my state
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could
But it's too late

[Verse 1]
What you gonna do?
Time's caught up with you
Now, you wait your turn
You know there's no return
Change your empty rules!
You join the other fools!
Turn to something new!
Now, it's killing you!

[Verse 2]
First, it was the bomb
Vietnam napalm
Disillusioning
You push the needle in
From life, you escape!
Reality's black drape!
Colours in your mind!
Satisfy your time!

[Instrumental change]

[Verse 3]
Oh, you, you know you must be blind
To do such things like this
To take the sweet that you don't know
You're giving Death a kiss
Poor little fool now

[Verse 4]
Your mind is full of pleasure
Your body's looking ill
To you, it's shallow leisure
So drop the acid pill
Don't stop to think now

[Bridge]
You're having a good time, baby
But that won't last
Your mind's all full of things
You're living too fast
Go out, enjoy yourself
Don't bottle it in
You need someone to help you
Stick the needle in, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
Now, you know the scene
Your skin starts turning green
Your eyes no longer seeing
Life's reality
Push the needle in!
Face Death's sickly grin!
Holes are in your skin!
Caused by deadly pin!

[Verse 6]
Head starts spinning 'round
You fall down to the ground
Feel your body heave
Death's hand starts to weave
It's too late to turn!
You don't wanna learn!
Price of life is high!
Now, you're gonna die!

[Verse 1]
I’m looking through a hole in the sky
I’m seeing nowhere through the eyes of a lie
I’m getting closer to the end of the line
I’m living easy where the sun doesn’t shine

[Verse 2]
I’m living in a room without any view
I’m living free because the rent’s never due
The synonym of all the things that I’ve said
Are just the riddles that are built in my head

[Chorus]
Hole in the sky
Gateway to Heaven
Window in time
Through it, I’ll fly

[Verse 3]
I’ve seen the stars that disappear in the sun
But shooting’s easy if you’ve got the right gun
And even though I’m sitting waiting for Mars
I don’t believe there’s any future in cars

[Chorus]
Hole in the sky
Gateway to Heaven
Window in time
Through it, I’ll fly
Yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
I’ve watched the dogs of war enjoying their feast
I’ve seen the western world go down in the east
The food of love became the greed of our time
And now we’re living on the profits of crime

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Take me through the centuries to supersonic years
Electrifying enemy is drowning in his tears
All I have to give you is a love that never dies
The symptom of the universe is written in your eyes
Yeah! Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Mother Moon, she’s calling me back to her silver womb
Father of creation takes me from my stolen tomb
Seventh Advent unicorn is waiting in the skies
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies
Yeah! Yeah!

[Verse 3]
Take my hand, my child of love, come step inside my tears
Swim the magic ocean I’ve been crying all these years
With our love, we’ll ride away into eternal skies
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies
Yeah! Yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Woman child of love’s creation
Come and step inside my dreams
In your eyes, I see no sadness
You are all that loving means
Take my hand, and we’ll go riding
Through the sunshine from above
We’ll find happiness together
In the summer skies of love

[Verse 1]
(I hide–I hide–I hide–)
I hide myself inside the shadows of shame
The silent symphonies were playing their game
My body echoed to the dreams of my soul
It started something that I could not control
Where can I run to now, the joke is on me
No sympathizing God, it's insanity, yeah

[Refrain]
Why don’t you just get out of my life, yeah?
Why don't you just get out of my life, now?
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone, now?
Why doesn’t everybody leave me alone, yeah?

[Verse 2]
(Obsessed–obsessed–obsessed–)
Obsessed with fantasy, possessed with my schemes
I mixed reality with pseudo-God dreams
The ghost of violence was something I'd seen
I sold my soul to be the human obscene
How could this poison be the dream of my soul?
How did my fantasies take complete control, yeah?

[Refrain]
Why don't you just get out of my life, yeah?
Why don't you just get out of my life, now?
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone, now?
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone, yeah?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Well, I feel something's taking me I don't know where
It’s like a trip inside a separate mind
The ghost of tomorrow from my favorite dream
Is telling me to leave it all behind
Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow
Gotta get to happiness, want no more of sorrow

[Chorus]
Realised when to hide
How I tried to get away from you, now
Now am I right if I fight
That I might just get away from you, now
Sting me!

[Verse 4]
Well, I feel something’s giving me the chance to return
It's giving me the chance of saving my soul
Pictures of demigod are fading away
I’m going backward, but I'm in control
Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow
Getting back to sanity, providence of sorrow

[Chorus]
Was it wise to disguise
How I tried to get away from you, now?
Is there a way that I can pay
Or is it true I have to stay with you, now?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
How I lied, went to hide
How I tried to get away from you now
Am I right in my fight
That I might just get away from you now
Suck me!

[Verse 5]
I'm really digging schizophrenia, the best of the earth
I'll chase my soul in the fires of hell
Peace of mind eluded me, but now it’s all mine
I simply try, but he wants me to fail
Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow
Now I've found my happiness, providence of sorrow

[Chorus]
No more lies, I got wise
I despise the way I worshiped you
Now I'm free, let me see
That now instead, I won't be led by you, now
Free!

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
I am Iron Man!

[Verse 1]
Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves will he fall?

[Verse 2]
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

[Verse 3]
He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

[Verse 4]
Now, the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now, he has his revenge

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again!

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]

[Riff]

[Verse 1]
What is this that stands before me?
Figure in black which points at me
Turn 'round quick and start to run
Find out I'm the chosen one
Oh, no!

[Verse 2]
Big black shape with eyes of fire
Telling people their desire
Satan's sitting there, he's smiling
Watches those flames get higher and higher
Oh, no, no, please, God, help me!

[Outro]
Is it the end, my friend?
Satan's coming 'round the bend
People running 'cause they're scared
The people better go and beware
No, no, please, no!

[Bass Instrumental: Bassically]

[Verse]
Oh yeah!
Some people say my love cannot be true
Please believe me, my love, and I'll show you
I will give you those things you thought unreal
The sun, the moon, the stars all bear my seal

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh yeah!
Follow me now and you will not regret
Leaving the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
Forever with me 'til the end of time

[Chorus]
Your love for me has just got to be real
Before you know the way I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel

[Post-Chorus]
Oh yeah!
Now, I have you with me, under my power
Our love grows stronger, now, with every hour
Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am
My name is Lucifer, please take my hand

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh yeah!
Follow me now and you will not regret
Leaving the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
Forever with me 'til the end of time

I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel

Our love grows stronger, now, with every hour

My name is Lucifer, please take my hand

[Instrumental Outro]

[Instrumental Intro: "Jack, the Stripper"]

[Verse]
Goin' home, late last night
Suddenly, I got a fright
Yeah, I looked through a window
And surprised what I saw
Fairy with boots and dancin' with a dwarf
Alright, now!

[Chorus]
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah, I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes
Alright, now!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah, I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes
Alright, now!

[Outro]
So, I went to the doctor, see what he could give me
He said, “Son; son, you’ve gone too far
'Cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do”
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Oh no, here it comes again
Can't remember when we came so close to love before
Hold on, good things never last
Nothing’s in the past, it always seems to come again
Again and again, again and again, and again

[Verse 2]
Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Captain's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights

[Bridge]
Circles and rings, dragons and kings
Weaving a charm and a spell
Blessed by the night, holy and bright
Called by the toll of the bell
Bloodied angels fast descending
Moving on a never-bending light
Phantom figures free forever
Out of shadows, shining ever-bright

[Refrain]
Neon Knights!
Neon Knights!
All right!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Captain's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights
Again and again, again and again, and again

[Refrain]
Neon Knights!
Neon Knights!
Neon Knights!
All right!

[Bass Instrumental: Bassically]

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
In the misty morning, on the edge of time
We've lost the rising sun, a final sign
As the misty morning rolls away to die
Reaching for the stars, we blind the sky

[Verse 1]
We sailed across the air before we learned to fly
We thought that it could never end
We'd glide above the ground before we learned to run, run
Now it seems our world has come undone

[Chorus]
Oh, they say that it's over
And it just had to be
Oh, they say that it's over
We're lost children of the sea
Oh, woah!

[Verse 2]
We made the mountains shake with laughter as we played
Hiding in our corner of the world
Then we did the demon dance and rushed to nevermore
Threw away the key and locked the door

[Chorus]
Oh, they say that it's over, yeah
And it just had to be
Yes, they say that it's over
We're lost children of the sea
Oh!

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
In the misty morning, on the edge of time
We've lost the rising sun, a final sign
As the misty morning rolls away to die
Reaching for the stars, we blind the sky

[Chorus]
Oh, they say that it's over
And it just had to be
Oh, they say that it's over
Poor lost children of the sea
Yeah!

[Outro]
Look out! The sky is falling down!
Look out! The world is spinning round and round and round!
Look out! The sun is going black, black!
Look out! It's never never never coming back, look out!
Fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine
She was up from another world, just to bust another soul
Her eyes were an endless flame, holy lightning
Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, yeah

We sailed away on a crimson tide, gone forever
Left my heart on the other side, all to break it into bits
Her smile was a winter song, a Sabbath ending
Don't sleep or you'll find me gone, just an image in the air

In dreams I think of you
I don't know what to do with myself
Time has let me down
She brings broken dreams, fallen stars
The endless search for where you are
(sail on, sail on)

Fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine
She was up from another world, just to bust another soul
Her eyes were an endless flame, unholy lady
Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, oh!
Don't sail away on a crimson tide!
Don't leave your heart on the other side!
Her eyes are an endless flame
Desire with a special name
Don't ever fall in love!
Don't give your heart away!
No never, never fall in love with a country girl!

Is it the end, my friend?
Satan's coming 'round the bend
People running 'cause they're scared
The people better go and beware
No, no, please, no!

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcerers of death's construction
In the fields, the bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Oh, Lord, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that all to the poor, yeah!
Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait till their judgment day comes, yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Now, in darkness, world stops turning
Ashes where their bodies burning
No more war pigs have the power
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of Judgment, God is calling
On their knees, the war pigs crawling
Begging mercies for their sins
Satan, laughing, spreads his wings
Oh, Lord, yeah!

[Outro: "Luke's Wall"]
Slipping away, just a heartbeat from disaster
Nothing could make me stay, close your eyes and I'll be gone
Turn the page, yeah, time to start another story
Slipping away, slipping away, time to move along

No reason to stay
Oh, when I'm slipping away

Take a look at yourself, you've been running in a circle
Round and round you go, you're a start without an end
Start a new life, yeah, from the city of the gypsies
Running away, slipping away, right behind the plow

Slipping away
Slipping away
Nobody to pay
Look out, 'cause I'm slipping away

Rockin' the glass, I won't leave you my reflection
A future without a past, no more road to take me back
Come if you will, just don't question my direction
Running away, slipping away, we can find the sun
Slipping away
Slipping away
Got nobody to pay
And you're slippin' away




No more running in a circle
It's time to move along
Round, round, round we go
A start without an end
So I'm slipping away
Slipping away

[Intro]
I am Iron Man!

[Verse 1]
Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves will he fall?

[Verse 2]
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

[Verse 3]
He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

[Verse 4]
Now, the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now, he has his revenge

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again!

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Close the city and tell the people that
Something's coming to call
Death and darkness are rushing forward to
Take a bite from the wall, oh
You've nothing to say
They're breaking away

[Hook]
If you listen to fools
The mob rules
The mob rules

[Verse 2]
Kill the spirit and you'll be blinded
The end is always the same
Play with fire, you burn your fingers and
Lose your hold of the flame, oh
It's over, it's done
The end is begun

[Hook]
If you listen to fools
The mob rules

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
You've nothing to say
Oh, they're breaking away
If you listen to fools

[Verse 3]
Break the circle and stop the movement
The wheel is thrown to the ground
Just remember it might start rolling and
Take you right back around

[Outro]
You're all fools
The mob rules

[Verse 1]
Sing me a song, you're a singer
Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil
The Devil is never a maker
The less that you give, you're a taker

[Chorus]
So, it's on and on and on
It's Heaven and Hell, oh well, yeah

[Verse 2]
The lover of life's not a sinner
The ending is just a beginner
The closer you get to the meaning
The sooner you'll know that you're dreaming

[Chorus]
So, it's on and on and on
Oh, it's on and on and on
It goes on and on and on
Heaven and Hell, I can tell
Fool, fool

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Yeah-yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Well, if it seems to be real, it's illusion
For every moment of truth, there's confusion in life
Love can be seen as the answer
But nobody bleeds for the dancer

[Chorus]
And it's on and on, on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
They say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you gotta ride it well
The world is full of Kings and Queens
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams
It's Heaven and Hell, oh well
And they'll tell you black is really white
The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's Heaven and Hell, oh no!
Fool, fool!
You've got to bleed for the dancer!
Fool, fool!
Look for the answer!
Fool, fool, fool!

[Instrumental Outro]

[Guitar Intro]

[Verse 1]
Finished with my woman, 'cause she couldn't help me
With my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frowning
All the time

[Verse 2]
All day long, I think of things, but nothing seems
To satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something
To pacify

[Chorus]
Can you help me
Occupy my brain?
Oh, yeah!

[Verse 3]
I need someone to show me the things in life
That I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh
And I will cry
Happiness, I cannot feel and love, to me
Is so unreal

[Verse 5]
And so, as you hear these words telling you now
Of my state
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could
But it's too late
Say you don't know me, you'll burn
You can refuse, but you'll lose, it's by me
Say you don't want me, you'll learn
Nothin' you do will be new, cause I'm through

Call me a liar, you knew
You were a fool, but that's cool, it's all right
Call me the Devil, it's true
Some can't accept but I crept inside you

So if a stranger calls you
Don't let him whisper his name
Cause it's Voodoo, oh

Fade into shadow, you'll burn
Your fortune is free, I can see it's no good
Never look back, never turn
It's a question of time 'till you're mine and you learn

So if a stranger sees you
Don't look in his eyes
Cause he's Voodoo
Say you don't know me, you'll burn
You can refuse, but you'll lose, it's by me
Say you don't want me, you'll learn
Nothing you do will be new, cause I'm through




Voodoo

Bring me your children, they'll burn
Never look back, never turn
Cry me a river, you'll learn Voodoo

[Verse 1]
Revolution in their minds, the children start to march
Against the world in which they have to live
And all the hate that's in their hearts
They're tired of being pushed around and told just what to do
They'll fight the world until they've won
And love comes flowing through, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today
Will the sunrise of tomorrow bring in peace in any way?
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear? Yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
So you children of the world, listen to what I say
If you want a better place to live in, spread the word today
Show the world that love is still alive, you must be brave
Or you children of today are children of the grave, yeah!

[Outro]
Children of the grave
Children of the grave

[Instrumental Intro]

No more war pigs have the power
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of Judgment, God is calling
On their knees, the war pigs crawling

Satan, laughing, spreads his wings
Oh, Lord, yeah!

[Outro: "Luke's Wall"]

[Verse 1]
He's just a loner
He never says hello
A friend to no one
He's got no place to go
He don't look happy
He looks through furtive eyes
He ain't got nothing
No one to sympathize

Alright now

[Verse 2]
He hides himself away
His secrets not revealed
As life just passes by
He keeps himself concealed
A solitary man
An enigmatic child
A riddle never solved
A prisoner exiled
Alright now

[Chorus 1]
I wonder if the loner can assimilate
A lifeless lived alone plays devil's advocate




C'mon now!

[Bridge]
Has he ever tried to be happy?
Reached out from inside
Someone on who he can depend
It's getting too late to recover
He won't stand a chance
And into his own hell he'll descend

Don't descend
Don't descend
Don't descend
Don't descend

[Verse 4]
No understanding
Of things we already know
He has to live his life
And just learn how to let go
Alright yeah

[Chorus 2]
Communication's an impossibility
His own best friend, but he's his own worst enemy
The secrets of his past locked deep inside his head
I wonder if he will be happy when he's dead




C'mon, yeah!

Is it the end, my friend?
Satan's coming 'round the bend
People running 'cause they're scared
The people better go and beware
No, no, please, no!
The epidemic from a crystal lie
Puts you in super over drive
The methademic that is so hard to hide
Insanely staring with wide eyes

Hallucinating in a chemical Hell
Ain't my idea of having fun
Synthetic overload you're under its spell
Your super nightmare's just begun

You try to stop, but it controls you
Your love affair with it won't last
You're on a suicidal ride of self-destruction
And in the end you're gonna crash

You live too fast
You live too fast

You look just like a dead man alive
Losing the fight for survival
You sit and wait at Hell's fiery gate
Waiting the Devil's arrival
Ha-Ha-Ha
You live so fast you need more methademic crystal
You never sleep you just keep goin
Just push the trigger on your hypodermic pistol
Each time you're dying without knowing




You live too fast
You live too fast

What's the point it's killing you without you even knowing
I can tell you've sold your soul and hell is where you're going
Ha-ha-ha I'll see you there

[Bass Instrumental: Bassically]

[Verse]
Oh yeah!
Some people say my love cannot be true
Please believe me, my love, and I'll show you
I will give you those things you thought unreal
The sun, the moon, the stars all bear my seal

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh yeah!
Follow me now and you will not regret
Leaving the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
Forever with me 'til the end of time

Your love for me has just got to be real
Before you know the way I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel

Our love grows stronger, now, with every hour
Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am
My name is Lucifer, please take my hand

Follow me now and you will not regret
Leaving the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
Forever with me 'til the end of time

[Chorus]
Your love for me has just got to be real
Before you know the way I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel

[Post-Chorus]
Oh yeah!
Now, I have you with me, under my power
Our love grows stronger, now, with every hour
Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am
My name is Lucifer, please take my hand

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
I am Iron Man!

[Verse 1]
Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves will he fall?

[Verse 2]
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

[Verse 3]
He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

[Verse 4]
Now, the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now, he has his revenge

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again!

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Is this the end of the beginning?
Or the beginning of the end?
Losing control or are you winning?
Is your life real or just pretend?
Reanimation of the sequence
Rewinds the future to the past
To find the source of the solution
The system has to be recast

[Verse 2]
Release your mind
Fast forward to the secrets of your soul
Your life's on overload
Delete or save
The units that make you an entity
That's your identity
If you don't know
Which way to go
You might be lost and confused
A second chance no time to lose
Regeneration of your cyber sonic soul
Transforming time and space beyond control
Rise up, resist, and be the master of your fate
Don't look badly for today, tomorrow is too late

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Verse 3]
You don't wanna be a robot ghost
Occupied inside the human host
Analyzed and cloned relentlessly
Synthesized until they set you free
Alright, okay, alright
'Til they set you free
Alright, okay
'Til they set you free

[Guitar Solo 2]

[Outro]
I don't wanna see you, yeah
I don't wanna see you, yeah

[Instrumental Intro: "Jack, the Stripper"]

[Verse]
Goin' home, late last night
Suddenly, I got a fright
Yeah, I looked through a window
And surprised what I saw
Fairy with boots and dancin' with a dwarf
Alright, now!

[Chorus]
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah, I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes
Alright, now!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah, I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes
Alright, now!

[Outro]
So, I went to the doctor, see what he could give me
He said, “Son; son, you’ve gone too far
'Cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do”
Yeah!

[INTRO] Pitbull

Kid Cudi, I love this record dawg so I had to spit somethin' on it right quick
Cyph

[?], You know what it is, back dat up
Mr. 305 know let me explain to you my life


(Pitbull)

[Remix verse]
Day and night (day and night)
I found myself thanking god for my life (for my life)
'Cuz I took all the wrong and made it right (made it right)
And I picked rap instead of dealin' weight, weight, weight
I took my fathers hustle (fathers hustle)
And I took all of my family struggles (family struggles)
And I mixed it up with all my mothers pain (mothers pain)
Whatchu see is whatchu get, Pitbull's the name, name, name

(HOOK x2)
'Cuz day and night (day and night)
I find myself alone in this fame (in this fame)
They own my music but not my mind (not my mind)
They can try but they can't stop my hustle, grind, grind, grind
(Kid Cudi)

[Verse 1}
Day and night
I toss and turn, I keep stress in my mind, mind
I look for peace but see I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run but see I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last

[Chorus]
'Cuz day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night

[Verse 2]
Hold the phone
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

[Chorus]
'Cuz day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change (yeah)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (yeah)
At, at, at night (yeah)

[Verse 3]
Slow mo'
When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new
He seems alive though he is feelin' blue
The sun is shinin', man he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights
They fade away, he slips into his white Nike's
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of

[Chorus]
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night, night
At, at, at night, night

[Verse 1]
Lost in the darkness, I fade from the light
Faith of my father, my brother, my Maker and Savior
Help me make it through the night
Blood on my conscience
And murder in mind
Out of the gloom I rise up from my tomb
Into impending doom
Now my body is my shrine

[Chorus 1]
The blood runs free
The rain turns red
Give me the wine, you keep the bread
The voices echo in my head
Is God alive or is God dead?
Is God dead?

[Verse 2]
Rivers of evil, run through dying land
Swimming in sorrow, they kill, steal, and borrow
There is no tomorrow
For the sinners will be damned
Ashes to ashes
You cannot exhume a soul
Who do you trust when corruption and lust creed of all the unjust
Leaves you empty and unwhole?

[Chorus 2]
When will this nightmare be over?
Tell me
When can I empty my head?
Will someone tell me the answer?
Is God really dead?
Is God really dead?

[Verse 3]
To safeguard my philosophy
Until my dying breath
I transfer from reality
Into a living death
I empathize with enemies
Until the timing’s right
With God and Satan at my side
From darkness will come light

[Chorus 3]
I watch the rain as it turns red
Give me more wine
I don’t need bread
These riddles that live in my head
I don’t believe that God is dead
God is dead

[Bridge]
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Wondering if we will meet again on the other side
Do you believe a word what the Good Book said?
Or is it just a holy fairytale and God is dead?
God is dead, God is dead
God is dead, God is dead, right?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 4]
But still the voices in my head
Are telling me that God is dead
The blood pours down, the rain turns red
I don’t believe that God is dead
God is dead, God is dead
God is dead, God is dead

[Verse 1]
You seen life through distorted eyes, you know you had to learn
The execution of your mind, you really had to turn
The race is run, the book is read, the end begins to show
The truth is out, the lies are old, but you don't want to know

[Chorus]
Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies

[Verse 2]
The people who have crippled you, you wanna see them burn
The gates of life have closed on you and there's just no return
You're wishing that the hands of doom could take your mind away
And you don't care if you don't see again the light of day

[Chorus]
Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies, you bastards!

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Where can you run to? What more can you do?
No more tomorrow, life is killing you
Dreams turn to nightmares, Heaven turns to Hell
Burnt out confusion, nothing more to tell, yeah
Everything around you, what's it coming to
God knows as your dog nose, bog blast all of you
Sabbath, bloody sabbath, nothing more to do
Living just for dying, dying just for you, yeah

[Instrumental Outro]

[Guitar Intro]

[Verse 1]
Finished with my woman, 'cause she couldn't help me
With my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frowning
All the time

[Verse 2]
All day long, I think of things, but nothing seems
To satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something
To pacify

[Chorus]
Can you help me
Occupy my brain?
Oh, yeah!

[Verse 3]
I need someone to show me the things in life
That I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh
And I will cry
Happiness, I cannot feel and love, to me
Is so unreal

[Verse 5]
And so, as you hear these words telling you now
Of my state
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could
But it's too late

[Intro]

[Riff]

[Verse 1]
What is this that stands before me?
Figure in black which points at me
Turn 'round quick and start to run
Find out I'm the chosen one
Oh, no!

[Verse 2]
Big black shape with eyes of fire
Telling people their desire
Satan's sitting there, he's smiling
Watches those flames get higher and higher
Oh, no, no, please, God, help me!

[Outro]
Is it the end, my friend?
Satan's coming 'round the bend
People running 'cause they're scared
The people better go and beware
No, no, please, no!

[Instrumental Intro: "Jack, the Stripper"]

[Verse]
Goin' home, late last night
Suddenly, I got a fright
Yeah, I looked through a window
And surprised what I saw
Fairy with boots and dancin' with a dwarf
Alright, now!

[Chorus]
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah, I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes
Alright, now!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah, I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes
Alright, now!

[Outro]
So, I went to the doctor, see what he could give me
He said, “Son; son, you’ve gone too far
'Cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do”
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Well, I don’t want no Jesus freak to tell me what it’s all about
No black magician telling me to cast my soul out
Don’t believe in violence, I don’t even believe in peace
I’ve opened the door, now my mind has been released

[Verse 2]
Well, I don’t want no preacher telling me about the god in the sky
No, I don’t want no one to tell me where I’m gonna go when I die
I want to live my life, I don’t want people telling me what to do
I just believe in myself ’cause no one else is true

[Bridge: Every Day Comes and Goes]
Every day just comes and goes
Life is one long overdose
People try to rule the nation
I just see through their frustration
People hiding their real face
Keep on running their rat race
Behind each flower grows a weed
In their world of make-believe

[Verse 3]
So believe what I tell you, it’s the only way to fight in the end
Just believe in yourself you know you really shouldn’t have to pretend
Don’t let those empty people try to interfere with your mind
Just live your life and leave them all behind

[Verse 1]
Have you ever thought about your soul
Can it be saved?
Or perhaps you think that when you are dead
You just stay in your grave
Is God just a thought within your head
Or is he a part of you?
Is Christ just a name that you read in the book
When you were at school?

[Verse 2]
When you think about death, do you lose your breath
Or do you keep your cool?
Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope?
Do you think he's a fool?
Well I have seen the truth, yes, I've seen the light
And I've changed my ways
And I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scared
At the end of our days

[Bridge]
Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say
If they knew you believe in God above?
They should realise before they criticise
That God is the only way to love
Is your mind so small that you have to fall
In with the pack wherever they run
Will you still sneer when death is near
And say that you may as well worship the sun?

[Verse 3]
I think it was true it was people like you
That crucified Christ
I think it is sad the opinion you had
Was the only one voiced
Will you be so sure when your day is near
Say you don't believe?
You had the chance, but you turned it down
Now you can't retrieve

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Perhaps you'll think before you say
That God is dead and gone
Open your eyes, just realise
That He is the one
The only one who can save you now
From all this sin and hate
Or will you jeer at all you hear?
Yes, I think it's too late

[Verse 1]
Rocket engines burning fuel so fast
Up into the night sky they blast
Through the universe the engines whine
Could it be the end of man and time?
Back on earth the flame of life burns low
Everywhere is misery and woe
Pollution kills the air, the land and sea
Man prepares to meet his destiny, yeah

[Verse 2]
Rocket engines burning fuel so fast
Up into the black sky so vast
Burning metal through the atmosphere
Earth remains in worry, hate and fear
With the hateful battles raging on
Rockets flying to the glowing sun
Through the empires of eternal void
Freedom from the final suicide

[Bridge]
Freedom fighters sent out to the sun
Escape from brainwashed minds and pollution
Leave the earth to all its sin and hate
Find another world where freedom waits, yeah

[Verse 3]
Past the stars in fields of ancient void
Through the shields of darkness where they find
Love upon a land a world unknown
Where the sons of freedom make their home
Leave the earth to Satan and his slaves
Leave them to their future in their grave
Make a home where love is there to stay
Peace and happiness in every day

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
What you get and what you see
Things that don’t come easily
Feeling happy in my pain
Icicles within my brain (Cocaine)

[Verse 2]
Something blowing in my head
Winds of ice that soon will spread
Down to freeze my very soul
Makes me happy, makes me cold

[Chorus]
My eyes are blind, but I can see
The snowflakes glisten on the tree
The sun no longer sets me free
I feel the snowflakes freezing me

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Let the winter sunshine on
Let me feel the frost of dawn
Build my dreams on flakes of snow
Soon I’ll feel the chilling glow

[Bridge]
Right!
Don’t you think I know what I’m doing
Don’t tell me that it’s doing me wrong
You’re the one that’s really the loser
This is where I feel I belong
Right!

[Verse 4]
Kiss the world with winter flowers
Turn my days to frozen hours
Lying snowblind in the sun
Will my ice age ever come?
OK, this is the time of night when we introduce everybody on stage, are you ready for it?

(Crowd cheers)

The guy you never see, Adam Wakeman. (Crowd cheers) Adam Wakeman! (Crowd cheers)

On bass guitar, Mr. Geezer Butler! (Crowd cheers) Mr. Geezer Butler!

On drums, Mr. Tommy Clufetos!  (Crowd cheers) Mr. Tommy Cluefetos! (Crowd cheers)

I can't fuckin' hear you, come on! (Crowd cheers) I'm not going to continue until I hear everybody.   (Crowd cheers)

On guitar, the one, the only, Mr. Tony Iommi!  (Big cheer)  Mr. Tony Iommi!   He's the King of Riffs, baby, comes up with them all the time.

And here's a song called "War Pigs."

[Verse 1]
Visions cupped within the flower
Deadly petals with strange power
Faces shine a deadly smile
Look upon you at your trial
Chill that numbs from head to toe
Icy sun with frosty glow
Words that glow read to your sorrow
Words that go read, "no tomorrow"

[Bridge]
Feel your spirit rise with the breeze
Feel your body falling to its knees
Take your wall of remorse
Turns your body to a corpse
Turns your body to a corpse
Turns your body to a corpse
Sleeping wall of remorse
Turns your body to a corpse

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Now from darkness, there springs light
Wall of sleep is cool and bright
Wall of sleep is lying broken
Sun shines in, you have awoken

[Bass Instrumental: Bassically]

[Verse]
Oh yeah!
Some people say my love cannot be true
Please believe me, my love, and I'll show you
I will give you those things you thought unreal
The sun, the moon, the stars all bear my seal

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh yeah!
Follow me now and you will not regret
Leaving the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
Forever with me 'til the end of time

[Chorus]
Your love for me has just got to be real
Before you know the way I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel

[Post-Chorus]
Oh yeah!
Now, I have you with me, under my power
Our love grows stronger, now, with every hour
Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am
My name is Lucifer, please take my hand

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh yeah!
Follow me now and you will not regret
Leaving the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
Forever with me 'til the end of time

[Chorus]
Your love for me has just got to be real
Before you know the way I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel

[Post-Chorus]
Oh yeah!
Now, I have you with me, under my power
Our love grows stronger, now, with every hour
Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am
My name is Lucifer, please take my hand

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
What you gonna do?
Time's caught up with you
Now, you wait your turn
You know there’s no return
Change your empty rules!
You join the other fools!
Turn to something new!
Now, it's killing you!

[Verse 2]
First, it was the bomb
Vietnam napalm
Disillusioning
You push the needle in
From life, you escape!
Reality's black drape!
Colours in your mind!
Satisfy your time!

[Instrumental change]

[Verse 3]
Oh, you, you know you must be blind
To do such things like this
To take the sweet that you don’t know
You're giving Death a kiss
Poor little fool now

[Verse 4]
Your mind is full of pleasure
Your body's looking ill
To you, it's shallow leisure
So drop the acid pill
Don't stop to think now

[Bridge]
You're having a good time, baby
But that won't last
Your mind's all full of things
You’re living too fast
Go out, enjoy yourself
Don’t bottle it in
You need someone to help you
Stick the needle in, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
Now, you know the scene
Your skin starts turning green
Your eyes no longer seeing
Life's reality
Push the needle in!
Face Death’s sickly grin!
Holes are in your skin!
Caused by deadly pin!

[Verse 6]
Head starts spinning 'round
You fall down to the ground
Feel your body heave
Death's hand starts to weave
It's too late to turn!
You don’t wanna learn!
Price of life is high!
Now, you're gonna die!

[Verse 1]
I want to reach out and touch the sky
I want to touch the sun, but I don’t need to fly
I’m gonna climb up every mountain of the moon
And find the dish that ran away with the spoon

[Verse 2]
I’ve crossed the oceans turned every bend
I found the plastic and the gold at rainbow’s end
I’ve seen thru magic and through life’s reality
I’ve lived a thousand years and never found the key

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Got no religion, don’t need no friends
Got all I want and I don’t need to pretend
Don’t try to reach me, ’cause I’ll tear up your mind
I’ve seen the future and I’ve left it behind

[Verse 1]
You seen life through distorted eyes, you know you had to learn
The execution of your mind, you really had to turn
The race is run, the book is read, the end begins to show
The truth is out, the lies are old, but you don't want to know

[Chorus]
Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies

[Verse 2]
The people who have crippled you, you wanna see them burn
The gates of life have closed on you and there's just no return
You're wishing that the hands of doom could take your mind away
And you don't care if you don't see again the light of day

[Chorus]
Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies, you bastards!

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Where can you run to? What more can you do?
No more tomorrow, life is killing you
Dreams turn to nightmares, Heaven turns to Hell
Burnt out confusion, nothing more to tell, yeah
Everything around you, what's it coming to
God knows as your dog nose, bog blast all of you
Sabbath, bloody sabbath, nothing more to do
Living just for dying, dying just for you, yeah

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
(I hide–I hide–I hide–)
I hide myself inside the shadows of shame
The silent symphonies were playing their game
My body echoed to the dreams of my soul
It started something that I could not control
Where can I run to now, the joke is on me
No sympathizing God, it’s insanity, yeah

[Refrain]
Why don't you just get out of my life, yeah?
Why don't you just get out of my life, now?
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone, now?
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone, yeah?

[Verse 2]
(Obsessed–obsessed–obsessed–)
Obsessed with fantasy, possessed with my schemes
I mixed reality with pseudo-God dreams
The ghost of violence was something I’d seen
I sold my soul to be the human obscene
How could this poison be the dream of my soul?
How did my fantasies take complete control, yeah?

[Refrain]
Why don't you just get out of my life, yeah?
Why don't you just get out of my life, now?
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone, now?
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone, yeah?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Well, I feel something’s taking me I don’t know where
It’s like a trip inside a separate mind
The ghost of tomorrow from my favorite dream
Is telling me to leave it all behind
Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow
Gotta get to happiness, want no more of sorrow

[Chorus]
Realised when to hide
How I tried to get away from you, now
Now am I right if I fight
That I might just get away from you, now
Sting me!

[Verse 4]
Well, I feel something’s giving me the chance to return
It’s giving me the chance of saving my soul
Pictures of demigod are fading away
I’m going backward, but I’m in control
Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow
Getting back to sanity, providence of sorrow

[Chorus]
Was it wise to disguise
How I tried to get away from you, now?
Is there a way that I can pay
Or is it true I have to stay with you, now?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
How I lied, went to hide
How I tried to get away from you now
Am I right in my fight
That I might just get away from you now
Suck me!

[Verse 5]
I’m really digging schizophrenia, the best of the earth
I’ll chase my soul in the fires of hell
Peace of mind eluded me, but now it’s all mine
I simply try, but he wants me to fail
Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow
Now I’ve found my happiness, providence of sorrow

[Chorus]
No more lies, I got wise
I despise the way I worshiped you
Now I’m free, let me see
That now instead, I won’t be led by you, now
Free!

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
I am Iron Man!

[Verse 1]
Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves will he fall?

[Verse 2]
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

[Verse 3]
He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

[Verse 4]
Now, the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now, he has his revenge

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again!

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
The neon lights are shinin' on me again
I walk the lonely streets in search of a friend
I need a lady to help me to get through the night
Through the night
If I could find her then everything would be alright

[Verse 2]
The sleepy city is dreamin’ the night time away
Out on the street, I watch tomorrow becomin' today
I see a man, he's got take away women for sale
Yes, for sale
Guess that’s the answer, 'cause take away women don't fail

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh, dirty women, they don't mess around
Oh, dirty women, they don't mess around
You've got me comin', you've got me goin’ around
Oh, dirty women, they don’t mess around

[Outro]
Walkin' the streets I wonder will it ever happen (dirty women)
Gotta be good ’cause then everything will be okay (dirty women)
If I could score tonight then I will end up happy (dirty women)
A woman for sale is gonna help me save my day (dirty women)
(Dirty women, dirty women, dirty women, dirty women...)

[Verse 1]
Revolution in their minds, the children start to march
Against the world in which they have to live
And all the hate that's in their hearts
They're tired of being pushed around and told just what to do
They'll fight the world until they've won
And love comes flowing through, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today
Will the sunrise of tomorrow bring in peace in any way?
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear? Yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
So you children of the world, listen to what I say
If you want a better place to live in, spread the word today
Show the world that love is still alive, you must be brave
Or you children of today are children of the grave, yeah!

[Outro]
Children of the grave
Children of the grave

[Guitar Intro]

[Verse 1]
Finished with my woman, 'cause she couldn't help me
With my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frowning
All the time

[Verse 2]
All day long, I think of things, but nothing seems
To satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something
To pacify

[Chorus]
Can you help me
Occupy my brain?
Oh, yeah!

[Verse 3]
I need someone to show me the things in life
That I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh
And I will cry
Happiness, I cannot feel and love, to me
Is so unreal

[Verse 5]
And so, as you hear these words telling you now
Of my state
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could
But it's too late

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah (I knew this day was coming)
Sometimes, you gotta come back down (It's all going to hell now, man)
Stoop to someone's level (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Five dozen flies buzzin' over your head
Call me the Grim Reaper, sleep is my cousin
You're dead to me now and I'ma be the last face you see
'Fore you die cussin' (Yep)
My eye a tiger's and I'm a survivor so I will rise up and (What?)
Be triumphant 'cause when I'm looking at my legacy (Leg, I see)
Bunch of dogs tryna dry hump it
Like Triumph The Puppet, so I'm like, "Fuck it"
Pile the carnage up 'til it's so high, it's touching the sky
Let 'em all line up and attack
Single filing up in the stack
Call 'em toy soldiers (Yeah)
'Cause they just wind up on their backs
Now the sky's nothing but black
But I am not coming back, I done told ya
I told the woke me to go to sleep
But still, they keep on provoking me
They're hoping to see me completely broken emotionally
But how in the fuck am I not supposed to be woke
When these fuckers just keep poking me? Now

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where I am going

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I've been down, kicked
Like around six thousand times since I was a kid
As a child, picked on, clowned, been
Countless times I've been doubted
Gotta remind myself of it every now and then (Yeah)
So the route I went's self-empowerment
In a hole, taught myself how to get out of it
And balance it with talents, wit
'Cause life is like a penny (Life is like a penny)
'Cause it's only one percent
Who overcome the shit they've underwent
I went AWOL like what my back was up against
Don't tell me 'bout struggle, bitch, I lived it
I was five or six the first time I got my hind end kicked
Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogie jumped me and took my tricycle
And I don't know if I would call that white privilege, yeah
But I get it, how it feels to be judged by pigment
Besides getting it from both sides of the tracks
But I swore I'd get them back
Even if it meant selling my soul to get my revenge and (What?)
Thought of a scheme and it got me to thinking
If I can believe in myself, I could prolly achieve it
That's part of the reason I do all my talking with ink
And as long as I'm breathing, I vow to outsmart 'em and beat 'em
My God, what a heart of a demon, go at 'em and I'ma get even
Like I'm in the Garden of Eden, I'm 'bout to go off of the deep end
This evil is calling, I'm already seething and

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where I am going

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Okay, so while Macklemore was keeping his room nice and neat (Yeah)
I was getting my ass beat twice a week (What?)
Looking for a place for the night where I could sleep (Yeah)
Flippin' sofa cushions over just tryin' to see
If I could find some change and scrape up for a bite to eat
If Denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece
Twenty five cents each'd get us a bag of chips
We'd be glad to get that even if we had to split
We'd do backward flips, looking back at it
I think that would fit with the definition of not having shit
Couple that with the fact my mother was batshit
Pop was a sack of shit, yeah, he died, but I gave half a shit
Yeah, which brings me back to the dear ol' dad that I zero had
Since a year-old, forty-seven year-old scab
Just to hear them words, ear piercing
Like my earlobe stabbed with a needle for an earring
Should I feel upset? You were dead to me 'fore you died
Me? Tear no shed
Should I have made a mural at your funeral?
Had your coffin draped with a hero's flag?
Where the fuck you were at
When De'Angelo done hurt me real bad at the Rio Grande?
Never met your grandkids, fucking coward
Only guts you had was from your stomach fat
I couldn't see your ass goin' to Heaven
So I'm asking for a pass to go to Hell
So I can whip your fucking ass
I hate that I'll never get to say "I hate you" to your face
No coming back from where I'm going
Sky is dark, my soul is black, hand on the shovel
Dig with the blade of it then I step on the metal
Vendetta to settle, tell the Devil

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Eminem]
I'm leaving Heaven (Yeah)
I'm leaving Heaven (You know, I should dig your motherfucking ass up)
Angels won't find me (Just to spit in your fucking face)
Where I am going (Holding my baby pictures up like you're proud of me)
I'm leaving Heaven (Fuck you, bitch)
I'm leaving Heaven (You know what? Maybe if I hadn't had you)
Angels won't find me (I wouldn't have went through half the shit I went through, so I blame you)
Where I am going (Or maybe I should say, "Thank you")
('Cause I wouldn't have been me, haha)

[Outro: Skylar Grey & Eminem]
So you better, you better run (Yeah)
You better, you better run (So I'ma let it go now, rest in peace)
You better, you better run (Cocksucker, haha)
You better, you better run (See you in Hell)

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Verse 1]
Here I am, alone again
Can't get out of this hole I'm in
It's like the walls are closin' in
You can't help me, no one can
I can feel these curtains closin'
I go to open 'em
But something pulls 'em closed again
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
Feels like I'm loathing in Las Vegas
Haven't got the vaguest why I'm so lost
But I'd make you this small wager
If I bet you I'll be in tomorrow's paper
Who would the odds favor?
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
I'm so much like my father, you would think that I knew him
I keep pacin' this room, Valium, then chase it with booze
One little taste, it'll do
Maybe I'll take it and snooze, then tear up the stage in a few
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
Fuck the Colt 45, I'ma need somethin' stronger
If I pop any caps, it better be off of vodka
Round after round after round, I'm gettin' loaded (Haha)
That's a lot of shots, huh? (Double entendre)
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Verse 2]
Now I'm starin' at the room service menu off a benzo
I can hear the music continue to crescendo
I can see the whole fuckin' venue from my window
That's when you know you're schizo (Hello, darkness, my old friend)
'Cause I keep peekin' out the curtain from the hotel
The music is so loud
But it's almost as though I don't hear no sound
I should get ready for the show now
Wait, is this the whole crowd? I thought this shit was sold out
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
But it's only the opening act, it's early, don't overreact
Then something told me relax
And just hope for the show to be packed
Don't wanna hit the stage before they fill each row to the max
'Cause that'd be totally wack
You can't murder a show nobody's at (Hello darkness, my old friend)
But what if nobody shows? Panic mode
'Bout to snap and go motherfuckin' wacko at any second
'Bout to cancel the show just as fans below rush the entrance
Plan is a go to wreck shit, cameras in all directions (Hello, darkness, my old friend)
The press is 'bout to go ape shit, bananas on all the networks
Commando with extra clips, I got ammo for all the hecklers
I'm armed to the teeth, another Valium, fall off the bed
Hit the ground and crawl to the dresser
Alcohol on my breath as I reach for the scope
I'm blackin' out, I'm all out of meds
With them benzodiazepines gone
Now it's just magazines sprawled out on the floor
Fuck the media, I'm goin' all out, this is war
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore (Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Verse 3]
People start to show up, time to start the show up
It's 10:05 PM and the curtain starts to go up
And I'm already sweatin', but I'm locked and loaded
For rapid fire spittin' for all the concert-goers
Scopes for sniper vision, surprise from out of nowhere
As I slide the clip in from inside the hotel
Leanin' out the window, going Keyser Söze
Finger on the trigger, but I'm a licensed owner
With no prior convictions, so law says sky's the limit
So my supply's infinite, strapped like I'm a soldier
Got 'em hopping over walls and climbing fences
Some of them John Travolta, staying alive by inches
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
Cops are knockin', oh fuck, thought I blocked the entrance
Guess show time is over
No suicide note, just a note for target distance
But if you'd like to know the reason why I did this
You'll never find a motive, truth is I have no idea
I am just as stumped, no signs of mental illness
Just tryin' to show ya the reason why we're so fucked
'Cause by the time it's over, won't make the slightest difference
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Outro]

[Intro: Bizarre & Ed Sheeran]
Damn, girl, with your sexy ass, haha
Let me holla at you
D.A. got that dope
It's one of those kinda nights

[Verse 1: Eminem, Ed Sheeran, & Bizarre]
Yes, this beat’s takin' me back to my D12 days
When we hit the club to go and hell-raise
Probably end up baggin' the cocktail waitress
And takin’ her straight back to the Motel-8
Yeah, Bizarre's tryna get a lap dance
Off a Xanax and Jack Dan' (Ayo)
Stripper walk by, I'm like "Goddamn"
She's like "That's harassment," I'm like "Yeah, and?" (Woo)
Holy Toledo, it's Miss Ohio
That’s the best ass I’ve seen in a while
We should be datin', she’s from Cleveland
But she's a bengal, this chick is catty
Is that a mini-skirt if it's a maxi?
That's the shortest thing for a dress since an addy (Since an addy)
She said "Fuck off" and threw her liquor at me
It’s one of those kinda nights
Then I said, I said

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into that red dress you like
When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sunrise
It's one of those kinda nights

[Verse 2: Eminem]
This beat keeps takin' me back like my ex does
Only 'cause how good the sex was
Hit up the next club, met Alexa
But she was so extra, called her et cetera
Had her like, "Oh my God
My whole iPod's filled with your songs, I mow my lawn to 'em"
I said, "Oh my God, you know my songs?
That's totally awesome, I'm Marshall, what's goin' on? Ah (Haha)
Seriously though, jokes aside, how you doin'? You straight?"
She said, "No, I'm bi"
She said, "Are you drunk?," I said, "No, I'm high
I'm checkin' out the chick," she said, "So am I"
"What's in the cup, let me see that
Girl, where the rest of that promethazine at?"
She said, "Cool, gotta run out to my Cadillac though
And I'll be like Fat Joe, and bring the lean back"
Then I said

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into that red dress you like
When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sunrise
It's one of those kinda—

[Verse 3: Eminem]
OMG
Like the gas in the tank, she's gettin' low on me
Said she wants to go with me
I said, "Go with you where?" She said, "Out"
I said, "I'm a candle, I'll go out if you blow on me"
Walk her out to the parkin' lot, here comes Da Brigade
Turn like a flip page, Swifty look shitfaced
Say peace to McVay and me and this chick take off like a sick day
Drivin' around, I said, "Let's pull over," she said, "No problemo"
Windows are dark tint, roll up the car windows
Monte Carlo in park, bumpin' Bizarre's demo
Gettin' head in the bucket, Marshmello
Yeah, I never in the club met a woman worth knowin'
But if you're ho'in
Opposites attract, I'm someone, you're a no one
I'm high and you're bi, I'm comin', you're goin'

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into that red dress you like
When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sunrise
It's one of those kinda nights

[Intro: Eminem & Don Toliver]
(Oh, oh, yeah) Yeah
You know, if I had a chance to do it all over again (Oh, oh)
I wouldn't change shit (Oh, oh)
D.A. got that dope
I'm screamin' out no regrets

[Chorus: Don Toliver]
You been through the hardest spot, ego the largest, I made you a star (I'm screamin' out no regrets)
I been movin' slowly, tryna play it low, the 'Vette look like a storm (Screamin' out no regrets)
Put you through dumb shit, got you thinkin' I run shit (I ain't havin' regrets)
I've been feeling so alone, just like I'm so lost, just like I'm—

[Verse 1: Eminem & Don Toliver]
Yeah, they miss the old me
I think they want me to OD on codeine
They want my life in turmoil like in '03
They want front row seats, I give 'em nosebleeds
They want me imploding, exploding, self-loathing, eroding
I'm screaming at 'em with no regrets and I'm hulking
I'm rippin' out of my clothing
I had to go see the doc like Kool Moe Dee (Yeah)
Never took much to convince Dre
Never been swayed by color or skin shades
Since day one, Hellraiser with twin blades of a sensei
Givin' up, no comprende (Woo)
Tin brain, prolly fucked in the membrane
Slim Sha— mind's in the gutter, but insane
Pen game like I just struck in the tenth frame (Screamin' out no regrets)
Yeah, I live on the edge, I sit on the ledge
To shit on your heads, I been on the bench
Forgive and forget is the only thing I'd ever live to regret
Hell-bent on revenge, you left me for dead
I crawled out my grave, you better be ready and set
My enemies ain't put an end to me yet (I'm screamin' out no regrets)

[Chorus: Don Toliver & Eminem]
You been through the hardest spot, ego the largest, I made you a star (I'm screamin' out no regrets)
I been movin' slowly, tryna play it low, the 'Vette look like a storm (Screamin' out no regrets, yeah, no apologies, I ain't takin' shit back)
Put you through dumb shit, got you thinkin' I run shit (I ain't havin' regrets)
I've been feeling so alone, just like I'm so (Yeah) lost

[Verse 2: Eminem]
All the hate, can't tell exactly where it stems from
But it's happening again, huh?
Y'all used to be in my corner
Now you just backed me in one
Innocent bystanders, I'm bound to hit some
For some adversaries, I carry big guns
So some targets'll get the kill shot
Some, I just barely nicked 'em
I can make a mistake and erupt and end up takin' a dump
For sayin' some dumb shit, thinkin' I run shit
Misplacin' my anger enough to give Earl and Tyler, The Creator the brunt (Yeah)
Shoulda never made a response, shoulda just aimed for the fake ones
Them traitorous punks, 'cause snakes are just cunts
They can get fucked with eight hundred motherfuckin' vibrators at once (Yeah)
And for any of those who may have come close to about dyin'
And can't listen to "Arose" without cryin'
For those who feel low like you're 'bout spiralin'
But this is only for those that I'm inspirin'
Weapon never unholstered without firin'
My will I'm imposin', foes are gonna feel like they're in the throes of a mountain lion
They talk about my daughters hopin' I fly off of the handle (Handle)
'Cause my first thought is to trample and write a thousand bars
But sometimes it's like dropping' an anvil on a house of cards
Or Godzilla squashin' a crouton with combat boots on
Or droppin' a goddamn nuke bomb on top of an anthill
(I'm screamin' out no regrets) Can't do it, nah

[Chorus: Don Toliver & Eminem]
You been through the hardest spot, ego the largest, I made you a star (I'm screamin' out no regrets, took it all)
I been movin' slowly, tryna play it low, the 'Vette look like a storm (Screamin' out no regrets, yeah, no regrets though, no white flags either)
Put you through dumb shit, got you thinkin' I run shit (I ain't havin' regrets, yeah)
I've been feeling so alone, just like I'm so lost, just like I'm—

[Intro: Eminem]
And I don't think that I can stop it (Here it comes)
I do my best to try to block it (Redrum)
I've been sipping on like, vodka (Head's numb)
I'm blacking out, you better watch it (It's bedlam)

[Chorus: Eminem]
I thought I heard a voice in my head that said "Kill"
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, "Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will"

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
I'm a long way away from where you are in skill
Foreign wheels, my bitch wearin' four-inch heels
She on the orange pill
And she about to start taking off layers like orange peels
Sacha Baron Cohen, Ferrell, where am I going with this?
Oh yeah, I bar at will
And when you throw the iron in it, I'm all that still
The truth for real, I'm real true, call that trill
This is my house, this place is mine
Posted on any corner on any coast I'm on
You niggas need to leave that lean, Henny, and coke alone
Terror to the business, married to the strippers, T-Pain
Student of the game pre-Kane, you niggas Post Malone
Elite beatboxer minus the raps
Rollin' with at least three choppers, Ryan is that
I literally keep three shottas
I'm lyrically James Todd, Tariq Trotter minus the cap

[Chorus: Eminem]
I thought I heard a voice in my head that said "Kill"
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, "Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will"

[Verse 2: KXNG Crooked]
Manslaughter goons under the moonlight
John Wilkes, that's who I'm in the booth like
Ayy, bruh, I go ham for dead presidents
And everything I record is over your head like a boom mic
Why would you irrelevant fucks want to rebel against us
Knowing your Smith & Wesson has never been clutched?
Knowing you never been rushed by the most ignorant niggas invented
Them niggas that'll send you to the dentist to get a whole row of elephant tusks
Your teeth gone like you been on some meth and some dust forever
I see you, my niggas call me "The Enemy Watcher"
The minute we spot ya, the semi'll pop, nigga, we got ya
I'm livin' to conquer, remember the mantra, I'm grippin' the launcher
Like Em and the Doctor with no guilty conscience
I'm still shockin' like droppin' a boombox in bathwater
More shockin' than a pissed off Blanka

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
I just finished fuckin' a fish called Wanda
I'm finna wander off into yonder
Beyond just mentally stronger, memory monster
I remember the sponsorin' thought that conquered his triple entendre
You the cross of a unicorn and The Unabomber
Quit horsin' around in this building or you a goner
Your Willy Wonka persona won't help you any longer
I'm Optimus, I make prime examples of mini Tonkas
Hogtie your squad and go bonkers
Spin, grab Denaun's guitar and Honky Tonk ya
All your bars subpar like good golfers
I put a hole in one of you birdies with this Eagle and launch it (Pew)

[Chorus: Eminem]
I thought I heard a voice in my head that said "Kill"
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, "Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will"

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Now this will probably be the most illest shit that I've ever said
God bless the dead and let Biggie possess the pencil lead
They called me a sped and said that I had a messed up head
'Cause I said, "Motherfuck school," and instead went to special ed
Sippin' Bacardi and lime I start to recollect on the time
That I startled my mom and had her scared to death
Word to Method Man
She heard some Wu-Tang coming from towards the patio
She was like, "What the heck was that?"
She went to check on the noise and go inspect the deck
Then I jumped out with a sword and yelled, "Protect your neck"
Now bow to the Lord, hold up, no, better yet, kneel
Better yet, get down on all fours and take a vow to always
Rejoice in the sound of my voice, but you don't have a choice
Just a third of my will will overpower yours
Using about a fourth to create the amount of force
It'll take to knock out a horse like a tranq full of Tylenol
Enter my house of horrors with a thousand floors
Got a crown of thorns, but it won't fit around the horns
But I'ma keep it a buck like a dollar store
I'm more than you bargained for and I am far more worse
Than a forty-some bar Lord Jamar verse
Nothing means more than respect, so when I curse
You could say I swore to protect
My image, I have zero time or regard for
A never-was, been claiming rap when it's not yours
If it was anyone's house, G Rap and Rakim would be havin' you mop floors
Run-DMC would be havin' you cleanin' sinks
Yeah, your group was off the chain, but you were the weakest link
Rest of these youngins of mine
Time to start throwing some shade, this time I'm shutting the blinds
'Cause when I'm looking at y'all, shit, it's no wonder it's why
I need a visor, 'cause y'all are just sons in my eyes
Born a cynic and more demented than an orphanage with a morgue up in it
Next door to an abortion clinic
Newborn infants tortured and tormented
With their foreheads dented when they drop 'cause the floor's cemented
Their corpses get ornamented
The coroner with a storage bin rented
To store them in and the torsos of forty women reported missin'
Distorted, twisted, this isn't no storybook ending
This is only the beginning
So, Lord, forgive me, I'm hearing voices
I can't ignore them anymore, they're w
