 there girl when you call me
'Cause it's the kind of love I wanna give
Lady thats the life I wanna live
You make me wanna turn around and settle down
'Cause you the baddest girl around
Baby the illest (baby the illest)
That you thought it was the realest
(You know)

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Jay Sean, Both]
Shorty I'ma only tell you this once, you the illest (I know)
And for your loving I'ma die hard like Bruce Willis (Yeah, yeah I know)
You got spark, you, you got spunk (Ooh)
You, you got something all the girls want (Ooh)
You're like a candy store
And I'm a toddler
You got me wanting more and more of

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Your love, your love
Your love, your love
Your love, your love
Your love, your love
Your love, your love
Your love, your love
Your love, your love
Your love, your love

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
He the type to pop tags and be cockin' the brim
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym
And he keep a du rag, keep his wave on swim
Wa wa waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
'S' on my chest cuz I'm ready to save him
Ready to give up on anybody that plays me
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him
When he call me mama, lil mama, I call him baby

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Jay Sean]
Your love, your love (Yeah)
Your love, your love (Yeah)
Your love, your love (Yeah)
Your love, your love (Yeah)
Your love, your love (So fine)
Your love, your love (So fine)
Your love, your love (So fine)
Your love, your love (So fine)

[Outro: Nicki Minaj & Jay Sean, Jay Sean]
Find me in the dark
I'll be in the stars
Find me in your heart
I'm in need of your love
Baby, your love
Your love
Your love
Your love
Your love
Baby your
Baby your
You're the illest
Your love
Your love
Your love, your love
Your love, your love
Your love

[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
Why lie?
Why lie, yeah

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
I'm only comin' out to play
Nothin' more that I hate in this life
The wrong impression, I only have one to make
You can open your palm, waiting to catch a break
The cards will fall where they may
And what about me?
I believe in fate, huh
They wanna know where I'll be in five, huh
But, what about today? What about tonight?

[Refrain: Anderson .Paak]
Only one at a time
So precious, it's yours, it's mine
Only one at a time
My life, my life, yeah

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Am I wrong to assume
If she can't dance, then she can't ooh, yeah?
Am I wrong to say
If she can't dance, then she can't ooh?

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
Hey, I never wanna waste your time, my life
So precious, it's yours, it's mine
And look at the time, my God
So precious, it's yours, it's mine

[Refrain: Anderson .Paak]
Only one at a time
So precious, it's yours, it's mine
Only one at a time
My life, my life, yeah

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Smiles around the clock
Dance around the globe to Disco 54
I stare at you in the eyes and spin you on your toes
Music ain't music without soul
Feelin' the top row
Shut the blindfolds, pass the nitro
Rock the love boat, get high to get low
Chill the Merlot, steady your fast pour
You pick up, we go low
Make love once or more, we rest then encore
Do-do that-that-that, hey
Break you off in your Kit-Kat-Kat, hey
Never seen one this gorgeous
Pay your whole damn mortgage
Will you look at the time, hey?
Still you the one on the mind, hey
Still you the top of the rhyme, hey
Thank God that it's Friday
Tonight, let's be the life of the party
It's nothing to me
Get up and move your feet, ah!

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
I never wanna waste your time, my life
So precious, it's yours, it's mine
And look at the time, my God
So precious, it's yours, it's mine
I never wanna waste your time, my life
So precious, it's yours, it's mine
And look at the time, my God
So precious, it's yours, it's mine

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Hey, I never wanna waste your time, my life
So precious, it's yours, it's mine
And look at the time, my God
So precious, it's yours, it's mine
I never wanna waste your time, my life
So precious, it's yours, it's mine
And look at the time, my God
So precious, it's yours, it's mine
Place is packed tonight
Inside
Inside
Think I'd lose my mind
But then I see
My Baby

And it's real love
Real love
Real love in this club tonight

Real love
Real love
Real love in this club tonight

Cherry's keepin' it tight
Alright
Alright
Make it dance all night
Her and I
Alive
And it's real love
Real love
Real love in this club tonight

Real love
Real love
Real love in this club tonight

[Verse 1]
Big town
Synthetic apparitions of not being lonely
"Look, he's having a breakdown
Oh, what a letdown, a shame, I think he might die"
And now she's dancing enthralling, I guess I gotta wait my turn
I said, "Don't fall in love with the moment"
She said, "I've got a lot to learn"

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know I'm in love with this city
But the green is turning brown
And I just look pathetic now

[Chorus]
If she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're so intelligent, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)
And if she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)

[Verse 2]
She's inducing sleep to avoid pain
And I think she's got a gun divinely decreed and custom made
She calls on the phone like the old days, expecting the world
And don't fall in love with the moment
And think you're in love with the girl

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no more water in this city
But be careful or you'll drown
You think you've got it figured out

[Chorus]
If she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're so intelligent, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)
And if she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)

[Bridge]
Well, your face has got a hold on me
But your brain is proper weird
Are you feeling the same?
You just keep nodding at me, looking vacant

[Breakdown]
She likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're so intelligent
She's American (She's American)
She says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American
She's American

[Chorus]
If she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're so intelligent, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)
If she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant, She's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)
Gettin' near around 4 or 5
And the walls're turnin' over my mind
I don't think that there's a finer sight
Than my baby layin' down for the night

Oh, please
Feelin' like I'm falling asleep
Not ready to visit my dreams
Nothing in the world let me feel
Alone, while she's here next to me

So, we put it off and twisted up
And I'm thinkin' that it won't be enough
Maybe she could cook us somethin' up
Just a little bit to move it along

Oh, please
Feelin' like I'm falling asleep
Not ready to visit my dreams
Nothing in the world let me feel
Alone, while she's here next to me

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Go down
Soft sound
Midnight
Car lights
Playing with the air
Breathing in your hair
Go down
Soft sound
Step into your skin? I'd rather jump in your bones
Taking up your mouth so you breathe through your nose

[Verse 1]
Are we awake?
Am I too old to be this stoned?
Was it your breasts from the start?
They played a part
For goodness sake
I wasn't told you'd be this cold
Now it's my time to depart
And I just had a change of heart

[Verse 2]
I'll quote "on the road" like a twat
And wind my way out of the city
Finding a girl who is equally pretty won't be hard
Oh, I just had a change of heart

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3]
You smashed a glass into pieces
And that's around the time I left
And you were coming across as clever
Then you lit the wrong end of your cigarette
You said I'm full of diseases
Your eyes were full of regret
And then you took a picture of your salad
And put it on the Internet

[Bridge 1]
And she said, "I've been so worried about you lately
You look shit and you smell a bit
You're mad thinking you could ever save me
Not looking like that"

[Verse 4]
You used to have a face straight out of a magazine
Now you just look like anyone
I just had a change of heart
I feel as though I was deceived
I never found love in the city
I just sat in self-pity and cried in the car
Oh, I just had a change of heart

[Bridge 2]
Then she said, "I've been so worried 'bout you lately
You were fit, but you're losing it
You played a part, 'this is how it starts'"
Oh, I just had a change of heart
​

[Outro]
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
Oh, I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart

[Couplet 1]
Come gather around people
Wherever you roam
And admit that the waters
Around you have grown
And accept it that soon
You’ll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth saving
Then you better start swimming
Or you’ll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changing

[Couplet 2]
Come writers and critics
Who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance won’t come again
And don’t speak too soon
For the wheel’s still in spin
And there’s no telling who that it’s naming
For the loser now will be later to win
For the times they are a-changing

[Couplet 3]
Come senators, congressmen
Please heed the call
Don’t stand in the doorway
Don’t block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
There’s a battle outside and it is raging
It’ll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changing

[Couplet 4]
Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And don’t criticize
What you can’t understand
Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly aging
Please get out of the new one if you can’t lend your hand
For the times they are a-changing

[Couplet 5]
The line it is drawn
The curse it is cast
The slow one now
Will later be fast
As the present now
Will later be past
The order is rapidly fading
And the first one now will later be last
For the times they are a-changing

[Verse 1]
I wake up
I stretch out
I wonder what you're doin' right now
Yeah I slept, in my makeup again
Tell myself 'I must be crazy'
Thinkin' 'bout him
I find myself something decent to wear
Take the towel out of my hair
About that time, you call me
And I'm reminded, without you

[Chorus]
I'd be a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

[Verse 2]
I go to work
Work all day
I'm a walking tape recorder
Of everything you say
Walk to the car, dig out my keys
Start thinkin' if you were with anyone but me

[Chorus]
I'm a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

[Bridge]
There you are
On the street
Just standing there, waiting on me
I show you, my new shoes
You say you love them
'Nd baby without you -

[Chorus]
I'm a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

[Outro]
I wake up
I stretch out
I wonder what you're doin' right now

[Poem]
Silent Fire
Silent fire burning in the far
the corners of my soul I don't roam

"Will heaven be brighter?"
Silent fire
"Hold on much tighter"
Silent fire

A woman with fire in her eyes
Lays by the flowers
Welcoming what underneath lays
Silent fire

He goes with her
The path of crystals and shimmering rays
Welcoming me whole in all my ways
A Silent fire

- S. Mescudi

[Verse 1]
So I heard you found somebody else
And at first, I thought it was a lie
I took all my things that make sounds
The rest I can do without

[Chorus]
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else (Else, else...)

[Post-Chorus]
I don't want your body, I don't want your body
I don't want your body, I don't want your body
I don't want your body, I don't want your body
I don't want your body, I don't want your body

[Verse 2]
And c'mon baby (I know)
This ain't the last time that I'll see your face
And c'mon baby (I know)
You said you'd find someone to take my place (Place, place)
I just don't believe that you have got it in you
'Cause we are just gonna keep “Doin' it” and every time
I start to believe in anything you're saying
I'm reminded that I should be gettin' over it

[Chorus]
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else (Else, else...)

[Post-Chorus]
I don't want your body, I don't want your body
I don't want your body, I don't want your body
I don't want your body, I don't want your body
I don't want your body, I don't want your body

[Bridge]
Get someone you love?
Get someone you need?
Fuck that, get money
I can't give you my soul, 'cause we're never alone
Get someone you love?
Get someone you need?
Fuck that, get money
I can't give you my soul, 'cause we're never alone
Get someone you love?
Get someone you need?
Fuck that, get money
I can't give you my soul, 'cause we're never alone
Get someone you love?
Get someone you need?
Fuck that, get money
I can't give you my soul, 'cause we're never alone

[Chorus]
I don't want your body (I don't want your body)
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
(I don't want your body)
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else
(I don't want your body)
I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
(I don't want your body)
No, I don't want your body (I don't want your body)
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else
(I don't want your body)

[Backing Instrumental]
My day one motherfucking fans in this building, one time. As I look around-this the shit. I ain't been this intimate in a long time. We might be up here all motherfucking night, I got something. I ain't seen y'all in a minute, real shit. You know I mean it when I say, I been around the world and shit. A whole sea of people. But nothing like coming right here in front of this small group. The people that's been with me since day one. Kendrick Lamar EP. Kendrick Lamar OD. Section-mothefucking-.80. Real shit. This is cool right here goddamn, this is really cool right now. This about real shit, listen up. To Pimp a Butterfly. People said a lot about this album. That'd said album of the year, that' said album of this generation and all that shit. That's cool, but also real shit making this motherfucking album was therapy. Not only for you, but for me, You know what I'm saying? Because within six months of good kid, m.A.A.d city dropping, the life of what I knew, when I knew what it was, thinking I knew, that completely changed within six months. And uh, you going through the motional of the world telling you that you're great. And you trying to make yourself believe that shit, but it's hard because you're institutionalized from where you come from. Still trying to move around and stay the way I like I do. I'm a low-key nigga. And I ain't scared of the world. Me personally, I can't run around with a hundred niggas like I usually do. I don't need to, I don't want to. And that's just been me since day one. So trying to grasp the idea of them telling you who you should run with, it can't cut it. Because like I said on the Kendrick Lamar EP, "I need to be me goddamnit". I think this shit can live forever, but looking at y'all faces y'all just. I got some of the most loyal. dedicated motherfucking fans in the world (?). (?) I could talk all day (?). To Pimp a Butterfly. Y'all allowed this motherfucking album has soared all the way to the top with no motherfucking commercial success. Y'all allowed it to be top-tier without a constant radio single and shit. So that proves to you right there, music is not something you can motherfucking market all the time. This shit belong to you and you only, you know what I'm saying? Some shit that y’all can feel whether you insecure, whether you vulnerable, whether you mad, happy, angry, sad. You pop this motherfucking tape in, you pop your favorite music in, and you love and you live that shit. And you allow artists like me myself to come back to these group of people and perform the shit that I want to perform, you dig what I'm saying? This may be the first and last time I perform To Pimp a Butterfly on this run. Eight of the ten cities. And I made sure New York be one of them cities that I come back to to do this shit. So with that being said, we gon' rock this shit until the casket drop or until, until it all falls down. Let's go

[Intro: Usher]
When we come together, it's a miracle

[Hook: Usher]
Better than walking on water
Or breathing in space
Bigger than
Living forever
Making it rain
Miracles
Didn't know we'd overcome
Impossible
Making it rain
Miracles

[Verse 1: Usher]
I know what's inside you
How could I forget
When you're the only thought in my head
Take my hand
Girl, lets get lost
And ain't nowhere to find us
It's like heaven when we collide through
The world slows down as our hearts speed up
Candle lights burn out
But a fire in us
It's something that I believe in
I see you all around
So glad that I found that about ya

[Pre-Hook]
God dang sexy
God dang gold
God dang anything you know then you know

[Hook: Usher]
Better than walking on water
Or breathing in space
Bigger than
Living forever
Making it rain
Miracles
Didn't how we'd overcome
Impossible
Making it rain
Miracles

[Verse 2: Usher]
Miracles
Girl your love's my cover
I feel invincible
Miracles
When we touch I light up
We rough
I can't get enough
The world slows down as our hearts speed up
Candle lights burn out
But a fire in us
When we touch I light up
We rough
I can't get enough

[Pre-Hook]
God dang sexy
God dang gold
God dang anything you know then you know

[Hook: Usher]
Better than walking on water
Or breathing in space
Bigger than
Living forever
Making it rain
Miracles
Didn't know we'd overcome
The impossible
Making it rain
Miracles

A miracle
A miracle

[Chorus]
Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most
When you broke down, I didn't leave you
I stayed by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most

[Verse 1]
I gave you attention when nobody else was paying
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you saying?
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playing
That's for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was praying
Oh lord

[Chorus]
Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most
When you broke down, I didn't leave you
I stayed by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most

[Verse 2]
I gave you my heart when you said yours was broken
Yes I did
I gave you the key when the door wasn't open
Just admit it
See I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping
Can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turn to moping
Tell me...

[Chorus]
Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need you?
Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down, I didn't leave you
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
I need you the most
I went walking again, I'll go out
And forget to tell any of my friends where I'm going
I'm just drunk on the side of the road in a ditch
When you find me – I wanna go home, but I'm sick
There's more whiskey than blood in my veins
More tar than air in my lungs; the strung out call I make
Burned down on the edge of the highway
"I'm sorry for asking, but please, come take me home"

I quit talking again but I know you're still listening
To see if I sleep or I pierce my skin
Needles to the worn-out rags
The folds in my arms, the sickening black
And I haven't been taking my meds
Lock all the cabinets and send me to bed
'Cause I know you're still worried I'm gonna get scared
'Cause I'm alone again and I don't like the things I see

And I haven't been taking my meds
So lock all the cabinets, and send me to bed
'Cause I know you're still worried I'm gonna get scared again
And make my insides clean with your kitchen bleach
But I've kissed enough bathroom sinks
To make up for the lovers that never loved me
And I know my body is just dirty clothes
I'm tired of washing my hands
God, I wanna go home

[Intro]
King of R&B, R. Kelly
Juicy J in the building
Woaah

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Grab on it
Turn you over, find that spot like there's a map on it
Call my (?) will be the way that shawty snaps on it
I keep that pussy cummin' like I ran a tab on it
Hey we in here flexin' like it's nothin'
Runnin' and we bumpin'
Booty so big got a nigga hearin' trumpets
Sit it on my face like ba-da-bum-bum-bum
Make shawty make it clap like ba-da-bum-bum-bum
I'm gone throw this cash here, we gone lap it up
Purple on deck baby, we can smoke it up
She know what she doin' in that see through lingerie
I'mma have this room soundin' like a Mardi Gras parade

[Hook: R. Kelly]
She blow me like a tuba
I beat it up like a snare drum
That girl make me want it
Cause every time we in the bed room
It be soundin' like a marching band
It be soundin' like a marching band
It be soundin' like a marching band
I know the neighbors next door can feel that base
Cause every time we in the bed room
It be soundin' like a marching band

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
She like it on her chin like a violin
And she be dancin' like a Majorette
Wetter than a river and I'm divin' in
Everyday a good day for sex
Four in the mornin' just like two in the evenin'
Take her into my world now ain't no way she leavin'
Give her just what she need
Take her smoke and a breather
Ass soft as a feather, I TKO it, Mayweather
In the lobby Four Seasons with like ten or twelve broads
All headed to my suite, it's a million thot march
Only thing we ain't about to do is sleep
Beat it like a drum, it sound like we at a Jamboree

[Hook: R. Kelly]
She blow me like a tuba
I beat it up like a snare drum
That girl make me want it
Cause every time we in the bed room
It be soundin' like a marching band
It be soundin' like a marching band
It be soundin' like a marching band
I know the neighbors next door can feel that base
Cause every time we in the bed room
It be soundin' like a marching band

[Bridge: R. Kelly]
After the party she gone leave with me

After the party she gone leave with me

I know the neighbors next door can feel that base
Cause every time we in the bed room

[Outro]
It be soundin' like a marching band

[Hook x2]

It's harder, baby
And loving you

Yeah

I still get choked up inside
At the thought of you

I try so hard to be strong
But it's hard to carry on without you
Yeah

But I'm okay
I'm on a rise
Nothing's gonna stop me from gettin' it
But I'm okay
I'm on a rise
Nothing's gonna stop me from gettin' it

[Intro/Verse 1: Gucci mane]
Huh, huh, huh
I said I don't give a damn
I wouldn't give a damn
Professional, I'm professional
No petitionin'
No tint on there
You can look in here, my bitch just changed her hair
It was black, then she switched it blonde
I think she the one
Yellow Forigis same color of her panties, but she don't have them on
Mary Jane, we got a strong bond, but I love dope
Submarine full of clean ones, it's the love boat
Yo husband, he had a good run, but he back broke
He was a worker, anyway, I worked him 'til his back broke
And I sell the dope so fast, my bad my bad my bad
So many bags of gas, it 

[?]

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Verse Simmonds]
I don't give a damn 'bout them other hoes
I need a trap girl who can work a stove
I need a bitch to bring 'em in rain, sleet, or snow
A baby chopper in her purse and a brick of dope
She took the charge for a nigga, shawty never told
I love the girl more than a junkie love dope
We got that dope love
That dope love, dope love
Dope, dope, dope love
That dope love, dope love

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I don't give a damn 'bout them other hoes
I don't want to keep it secret no mo'
I'll take you anywhere you want, where you wanna go?
I'll drive to you in a blizzard, middle of the snow
I just wanna keep it real, keep you super cold
I'm just a black young nigga, mouth full of gold
I got a half a pound of purp if you wanna smoke
If the shit don't work, I'mma let you go

[Verse 3: PeeWee Longway]
I got dope love
Dope dick when I bust her up
I got big dough, big bank won't fold up
Talkin' big 'dro, OG gas in my pantry, girl
I'mma hit her on the stove, water whip
You want that Benz car?
She my dope lover
On the doors cuffed up, we poured up like Young Thugga
She silent as a 

[?]

[?]
You fuckboys
We got that dope love

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Verse Simmonds]
I don't give a damn 'bout them other hoes
I need a trap girl who can work a stove
I need a bitch to bring 'em in rain, sleet, or snow
A baby chopper in her purse and a brick of dope
She took the charge for a nigga, shawty never told
I love the girl more than a junkie love dope
We got that dope love
That dope love, dope love
Dope, dope, dope love
That dope love, dope love

[Verse 1]
When I was eleven I saw my dad's corpse
Innocence lost, hanging on the front porch
How do I deal?
I saw my dad's corpse
When I was eleven I saw my dad's corpse
Innocence lost, hanging on the front porch
How do I deal?
I saw my dad's corpse

[Verse 2]
When I was fifteen I saw a friend's corpse
Innocence gone, love and a blowtorch
How do I deal?
I saw a friend's corpse on the way to school
When I was fifteen I saw a friend's corpse
Innocence gone, love and a blowtorch
How do we deal?
I saw a friend's corpse on the way to school today

[Verse]
Momma told me wait
Momma told me wait
I can not relate
Eat what's on your plate
Fill yourself with hate
Take her on a date
Fill yourself with hate
Take it on a date

[Bridge]
Momma told me wait
Momma told me wait

[Verse 2]
Momma told me wait
Eat what's on your plate
Momma told me wait
Momma told me wait
I cannot relate
Eat what's on your plate
Fill yourself with hate
Give yourself a taste
Fucking on the first date
Sucking on the first date
Fill yourself with hate

[Outro]
Shit!
Did you hear that?
Did you fucking hear that?

[Chorus]
Making love till you scream, I wanna wake everybody
When we're making children, wanna wake everybody
And I mean every, every, every

[Verse 1]
Take your time, we got all night
Trust in me I'm gonna get it right
Whatever's on, take it off
I wanna get inside with you baby and get lost

[Pre-Chorus]
And the more I lay with you
I'm not concerned about what neighbors gon' do
And I don't care if they leave this room
Cause we'll be...

[Chorus]
Making love till you scream, I wanna wake everybody
When we're making children, wanna wake everybody
And I mean every, every, every

[Verse 2]
The way we touch, the way we kiss
Oh girl I love it when it feels like this
Just forget what you had to do
Cause the night is all about me and you

[Pre-Chorus]
And the more I lay with you
I'm not concerned about what neighbors gon' do
And I don't care if they leave this room
Cause we'll be...

[Chorus]
Making love till you scream, I wanna wake everybody
When we're making children, wanna wake everybody
And I mean every, every, every

[Bridge]
So open the window baby
I don't care if the world hears us baby
Cause as long as you're here lyin next to me
Girl, we can lay on the floor
Don't need any privacy

[Chorus]
Making love till you scream, I wanna wake everybody
When we're making children, wanna wake everybody
Making love till you scream, I wanna wake everybody
When we're making children, wanna wake everybody
Making love till you scream, I wanna wake everybody
When we're making children, wanna wake everybody
On the real though Donald Trump. How is it 'interesting' that these shootings happened in a country that's tough on guns? Tell us Don? Because it sounds like that vacuous observation was about giving your NRA-loving constituency a handjob and spinning a tragedy for political gain and I'm thinking maybe using a situation where dozens of innocents have just been murdered in the streets isn't the best time. No?

Love to Paris and any individual or family who's lost loved ones to evil anywhere in this world. Chill w/ the angels.

[Verse]
All the things I know right now
If I only knew back then
There's no gettin' over, no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish I could spin my world into reverse
Just to have you back again
There's no gettin' over, there's no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you

[Verse]
All the things I know right now
If I only knew back then
There's no gettin' over, no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish I could spin my world into reverse
Just to have you back again
There's no gettin' over, there's no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you, no, no

[Bassline/Chorus]
Just no gettin' over you
Just no gettin' over you

[Verse]
All the things I know right now
If I only knew back then
There's no gettin' over, no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish I could spin my world into reverse
Just to have you back again
There's no gettin' over, there's no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you

[Bassline/Chorus]
Just no gettin' over you
Just no gettin' over you
Just no gettin' over you
Just no gettin' over you

[Verse 1]
I feel you breathing down my neck
As the blood's rushing to my legs
Waiting for a chance to prove
That my soul, it belongs to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna go there
I just want a beautiful escape
I just wanna move ya
Show you that this love is yours to take

[Chorus]
And now we're driving, over
Fears that make us feel like we're not enough
Yeah, we're flying up, closer
Dancing on the edge of the world above
I was scared I couldn't show ya
All this lovin' that I hold inside
But now I feel your power
I am here, and I don't wanna hide
No more
Hmm, yeah, no more

[Verse 2]
Now I'm feeling like you're with me
As my heart's pouring on my sleeve
I don't want this rush to go
Oh I'm trying to let you know

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna go there
I just want a beautiful escape
I just wanna move ya
I just wanna take you to that place

[Chorus]
And now we're driving, over
Fears that make us feel like we're not enough
Yeah, we're flying up, closer
Dancing on the edge of the world above
I was scared I couldn't show ya
All this lovin' that I hold inside
But now I feel your power
I am here, and I don't wanna hide no more

No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more

[Chorus]
And now we're driving, over
Fears that make us feel like we're not enough
Yeah, we're flying up, closer
Dancing on the edge of the world above
I was scared I couldn't show ya
All this lovin' that I hold inside
But now I feel your power
I am here, and I don't wanna hide no more
No more

[Intro]
Ooh, MPC Cartel
Yeah, Soulja
Hey

[Chorus]
I just spent ten on the whole thang
Ridin' through the city and the car swang
Ten thousand dollars for my pinky ring
And she all on me 'cause I'm in the gang
I just spent ten for the whole thang, yeah
Make it rain
Walk inside the club and just make it rain
Walk inside the club and just make it rain

[Verse 1]
I just spent twenty for the whole thang
Call up my jeweler, that's a new chain
In a Lamborghini and I'm switchin' lanes
And your girl on me 'cause I'm in the gang
It ain't nothin' to me, I just make it rain
She just drop it down while I'm switchin' lanes
She just twerk everywhere, I'm gettin' cake
Every club I hit, you know I'm gettin' cake, getting cake
Ayy

[Chorus]
I just spent ten on the whole thang (Gra-pa-pa)
Ridin' through the city and the car swang (Gra-pa-pa)
Ten thousand dollars for my pinky ring (Gra-pa-pa)
And she all on me 'cause I'm in the gang (Pa-pa-pa)
I just spent ten for the whole thang, yeah (Gra-pa-pa)
Make it rain (Gra-pa-pa)
Walk inside the club and just make it rain (Gra-ta-ta)
Walk inside the club and just make it rain

[Verse 2]
She just all on me 'cause my ice chain
She wanna fuck my car, she wanna fuck my rims
She wanna suck my chain
She in love with my ring
I just hit the block and I make it rain
Shout out to the squad, shout out to the gang
Pull up to the club in a Fire Flame
Spent a hundred thousand on a Cuban link
Hey

[Chorus]
I just spent ten on the whole thang (Gra-pa-pa)
Ridin' through the city and the car swang (Gra-pa-pa)
Ten thousand dollars for my pinky ring (Gra-pa-pa)
And she all on me 'cause I'm in the gang (Pa-pa-pa)
I just spent ten for the whole thang, yeah (Gra-pa-pa)
Make it rain (Gra-pa-pa)
Walk inside the club and just make it rain (Gra-ta-ta)

[Verse 1]
And she lays down on her bedroom floor
The chemicals that make her laugh
Don't seem to be working anymore
She tries her best, but it hurts her chest
And even though her sun is gone
She'd like to love her child nevertheless

[Verse 2]
My hair is brown, she's scared to touch
And she just wants to feel something
And I don't think that's asking for too much
And when I go to sleep it's when she begins to weep

[Chorus]
She's appalled by not loving me at all
She wears a frown and dressing gown
When she lays down

[Verse 3]
We got a plane, oh to see my dad again
She prayed that we'd fall from the sky
Simply to alleviate the pain
Over water, hmm
Over terrain
The engines all go bust, we turned to dust
And I've no reason to complain, yeah
And in the end, she chose cocaine
But it couldn't fix her brain

[Chorus]
She's appalled
Oh, she doesn't love me at all
She wears a frown and dressing gown
When she lays down

[Spoken Outro]
That was it

[Verse]
And well, I think I've gone mad
Isn't that so sad?
And what a shame you've lost a brain that you never had
Oh, mum, check the car it can’t have gone far
I must have left it on a train or lost in a bar
It’s likely in a Sainsbury’s
Flirting with the girls and waiting for me
I jumped on a bus, declared my name
And asked if anybody's seen my brain
"Your brain was last seen going for a run
And would you sign an autograph for my daughter Laura?
'Cause she adores you
But I think you’re shit"
"I've gotta look for my brain for a bit!”
I stepped outside, it hurt my eyes
“Well what do you expect when you’ve got no mind!”
I searched all day it drove me insane
“Where would I be if I was my brain?”

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
The nice nurse told me she felt my pain
But she couldn't find a single trace of my brain
"Oops!... I Did It Again" started playing
Forget my brain, remember my name

[Intro]
So, this is gonna be one take!
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
I walk, I walk, I see the light
I push, I fall, and all of my life
I search for my love, I cannot find
A love like yours, as hard as I've tried
Lay by my side just for the night
This isn't love but it feels right
I must admit I cry at nights
I'm stuck on you and I don't know why

[Chorus]
You hit me hard, then you tore my world apart
How do I move on if I don't know where to start?
You've got a hold on me I'll admit that is true
So why do I keep searching when I'm stuck on you?

[Verse 2]
I don't know why I feel like this
At times I don't think I can handle it
I don't know why I feel so low
You were the one who kept me whole
You chew me up then spit me out
You stole the words right out my mouth
You fed me with "I love you"s
I don't know why I'm stuck

[Chorus]
You hit me hard, then you tore my world apart
How do I move on if I don't know where to start?
You've got a hold on me I'll admit that is true
So why do I keep searching when I'm stuck on you?
You hit me hard, then you tore my world apart
How do I move on if I don't know where to start?
You've got a hold on me I'll admit that is true
So why do I keep searching when I'm stuck on you?
You hit me hard, then you tore my world apart
How do I move on if I don't know where to start?
You've got a hold on me I'll admit that is true
So why do I keep searching when I'm stuck on you?

[Verse 1]
When did it go wrong? I will never know
I have loved you all my life
How did it slow down? I go round and around
Thinking about it all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
This love, it ain't over yet
There's too much that I haven't said

[Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go?

[Verse 2]
Why were you so cold? Let the truth be told
Tell me, was it all for the thrill?
What was I thinking? I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill

[Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me

[Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go?

[Bridge]
Oooh, sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark
Oooh, I thought I'd die in your arms

[Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go?

[Outro]
Hope you know, I won't let go

[Intro: Young Thug & sample]
What the fuck, you ready?
Alright, alright
What the fuck, you ready?
We got London On Da Track
What the fuck, you ready?
Alright, alright, alright!
Thugger!

[Bridge]
My birth certificate say I'm so magnificent
School? Didn't attend it 'cause they think I'm so magnificent
Head bigger 'cause my bitch say she magnificent
Hundred percent I cashed out when I bought my Bentleys
I've been grinding since I came up off the porch
She want me to pull the string and see if I'm so important
Not a toy, baby girl, I got a little boy
Aye (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo!)

[Verse 1]
I am magnificent, I'm cookin' chickens, and my neck is red like a hen
I told that little bitch that she not gon' win, and I told her to go hit it in
Choppers gon' chop, and I swear to God I am a slime, I'ma shoot at your spin
Watches on watches got timing on timing, I just might bring Flava Flava in
Caught me a big ol' lil body, lil bitch, and you know it's the Benz
Suck on my dick, baby, suck on my dick 'til you got a big chin
Soon as I fuck on your ho, boy, you know I'm gon' make her back bend
Cookies, I roll it, I roll it, got fish scale, but I don't got baits
These little bitches know that I am the future plus I'm holdin' weight
I pulled up, hop out the 'Rarri, now they tailgating
I might keep my hands down, let my jewelry wave

[Hook]
Bling, bling, bling, I iced out my team
If you ain't sayin' that nice, my nigga, what the fuck you mean?
I live it up, it's not the same
I like my bitch brown like sugar cane (Woah, woah, hey!)

[Verse 2]
Eat that pussy 'til I throw up
I got water out in Florida
Lil mama know I can't cuff her
Fuck cleaning, I'm a buffer
My diamonds black like a muffler
My bitch a gnat, and I trust her
Fuck nigga, you're pie, a custard
He got lames rhymes, no Busta
I'm like, "Nigga, bitch, I'm too fly for this shit"
Got a lot of niggas on the block that'll do or die for this shit
Got a lot of bitches out in Follies that'll come around with my clique
Nutted on the bitch's panties, she told her old man it was spit
Baby lil girl you know YSL is the realest they get
Bitch I'm on fire, fire, the best fire like a Bic
I want to know where it's at, and I swear to God, I'ma go get it
Turned up my birds in my words, and now I'm 'bout fly as a pigeon
Hop in my coup, and I brrrp the ceiling
My bitch, she rich and black like Oprah Winfrey
5-4-3-2-1, there go both her pimps
I like white meat, baby, pass me a little sugar
Hey, thirty two on my hip
Woah, no hole but I'ma let it rip
Or you could throw it off of the ship

[Hook]
Bling, bling, bling, I iced out my team
If you ain't sayin' that nice, my nigga, what the fuck you mean?
I live it up, it's not the same
I like my bitch brown like sugar cane (Hey, hey, woah!)

[Outro]
Monica, I like you, and I love your persona
Come with me, I'll buy you hair by the bundle
We go back and forth just like a runner
Lay beside you keep you warm like a mama
I don't want to keep discussing none of these lil numbers
I just want to feed you this candy like a Mamba
Bah kaw, kackaw kaw!

[Intro]
I wanna know, I wanna know

[Verse 1]
I wanna know how you got here
I wanna know who let you in
Baby girl come on, baby girl come on get in, Thugga
Bentley the coupe, and young nigga gonna fluke
And these bitches gon choose on him

[Hook]
I took one step forward and two steps back
I jumped so many hurdles to get where I'm at
I had one foot out and I had one foot in
And I ain't gonna look back if I get one more chance
And there's one thing that a nigga must understand
That tomorrow's not promised, this is your last day
And I'ma leave my fans with just one line
Try to live your life one day at a time
It's Gucci

[Verse]

[?] Anything
Then why I'm still hurdlin'
My cousin said "You're not a house, Gucci
So why the fuck you got

I applied for a job once
Really went with the workin'
But soon as I got to workin'
The same niggas start hatin'
I wasn't good at ridin' skateboards
I was better ridin' Daytons
I can't lie, nigga played for it
But it took a lot of patience

[Hook]
I took one step forward and two steps back

[Intro]
Get up, get out, go get that money
It’s time to work

[Verse 1]
Up early in the mornin’
I’m ready to go
It smells like struggle
When you open up the door
Everybody gotta grind
Got hustle in my blood
A little bit is not enough

[Chorus]
I go to work
Said hold up wait one minute
I go to work
I get out there and I go get it
I go to work
I don’t leave ‘til I come home with it
I go to work, hey

[Verse 2]
It’s the concrete jungle
So you got to understand can’t judge no body
Gotta get it how you can
Gotta handle your business when the baby gotta eat
Gotta get a real job
Or get it off the street

[Chorus]
I go to work
Said hold up wait one minute
I go to work
I get out there and I go get it
I go to work
I don’t leave ‘til I come home with it
I go to work, hey

[Bridge]
Calling all ladies don’t be shy
Don’t let the moment pass you by
Grab your girls get on the floor
This is what you’ve been waiting for
Work, work
I said, there ain’t no problem that music can’t solve
And I work it out, alright
If you wanna have fun when the weekend comes
Let’s work it out
I got to work (let’s work, let’s work)
I got to work (let’s work, let’s work)
I got to work (let’s work, let’s work)
I got to work (let’s work, let’s work)
Hey, hey

[Chorus]
Now let me see you work
Said hold up wait one minute

La La La La
Ooooooo

[Verse 1]
Hello My name Is CeeLo Green and I’ve go the blues
Cause don’t nobody love me no more
Maybe just alittle bit more than you did yesterday
But not like you loved my before

[Chorus]
See I’m tired, so tired
But I can’t please everybody
But I try
I try

[Verse 2]
My name is CeeLo Green and I got the blues
Don’t nobody appreciate me
My heart is filled with unconditional love
How could anyone hate me?

[Chorus]
See I’m tired, so tired
Maybe the world will be better off without me
But I try
I’ll try

[Verse 3]
My name is CeeLo Green and I’ve got the blues
I don’t know what else to do
The only reason I’m alive right now
I’m living for the love of you

[Chorus]
But I’m tired so tired
God bless my soul
Cause I try
I try
This is our song
Sing it with me children

Nobody lives forever
So come on let’s have some fun
And I want a happy ending
Just like everyone wants one
And life would be sweeter
If we all had somewhere we could run
Oh don’t you dare tell me what can’t be done

They say you don’t have to grow up
But you’ve got to grow older
It only hurts when I laugh
You see
'Cause I’ll always be young, I’ll always be young
In my mind
But I’m racing against the time

(alright, yea yea yea, na na na, yea yea yea)
Never mind the mirror in your room
Be who you feel
The grounds under your feet
But you won’t get there standing still
Peak and valley is a promise
But don’t you stop until
Oh and I’ll make it, yes I’ll make it, yes I will

Had a fight with my father time
About my mother’s nature
That makes me destiny’s child
Cause see I’ll always be young, I’ll always be young
In my mind
I’m racing against the time

(alright, yea yea yea, na na na, yea yea yea)

I’m racing against the time

(alright, yea yea yea, na na na)

I won’t keep any secrets from you, baby
I’m a sinner (Alright)
And I may have lost your war of words
But hey now I'm still a winer
Does wearing your heart on your sleeve really mean
That it is isn’t in you?
Looking good but you aren't that great of a pretender
When everything is said and done
I'll be alive in my own son
SO I'll be there when his son has one
I'll always be young young in my mind

(alright, yea yea yea, na na na
Alright, yea yea yea, na na na
Alright, yea yea yea, na na na
Alright, yea yea yea, na na na)

Racing against the time

[Intro]
It might sound crazy
But I think I recognize her from a dream
She’s the most beautiful girl
That I’ve never seen Instantly

[Verse 1]
I'm in love she’s the same as she was
At the thing that she does
I just smile and I stare
Should go over and see
If she remembers me
Cause there still seems to be
One more empty chair
It's destiny if you believe in that type of thing
Oh
And I was wondering where’s your wedding ring
Let’s get reacquainted
This is nice ain't it
You look beautiful tonight
And this could be the beginning of the rest of your life

[Chorus]
And if it were left up to me
I would have already met her
But it’s better
(Better)
It’s better late than never

[Verse 2]
I would love a perfect woman
But you can’t create her
Now see a friend of a friend of a friend
Used to date her
He used to brag and he’d boast
How he loves her the most
And they seemed so close
And in love at the time
But soon after she found
He was getting around
She deserves to be loved
But one at a time
At first he felt like it couldn’t be explained
Oh but I love you girl
And I am not ashamed
Oooh
Oh I can’t wait
Step out on faith
Love and trust
And he ended up being happy for the both of us

[Chorus]
If it were left up to me
I would’ve already met her
But it’s better
(Better)
It’s better late than never
And we should cherish
Oh this moment together
Cause it’s better
It’s better late than never

[Bridge]
I've been waiting
Waiting and waiting
You’re mine baby

[Chorus]
If it were left up to me
I would’ve already met her
But it’s better
(Better)
It’s better late than never
If it were left up to me
I would’ve already met her
But it’s better
(Better)
It’s better late than never
Verse 1:
Instantly
Right in front of your eyes
The rhythm gets inside of me
And I come alive
And it makes my body hot
I’m turned up all the way
Can’t you hear it talking
And sometimes all you can say
You say ohhh, ohhh
I'm staring through ya
I’m watching it happen to you
You say Ohhh, ohhh
Our rhythm is gonna get you
I’ll be right there right with you

Chorus:
I said you
And me
We
Are starting to smell like fire, babe
I said you
And me
We
Are starting to smell like fire, babe
Ooh
Verse 2:
Ooh I told ya baby
If you were wondering how
Now you’re starting to steam
Do you believe me now?
And don’t it make your body hot
Your sexy is starting to burn
Everybody’s waiting
Baby now it’s your turn
You Say ohh ohh
Feels so nice and cozy
'Cause now your body knows me
I said ohh, ohh
Don’t take your heat from me
Cause it’s cold without your company

Chorus:
I said you
And me
We
Are starting to smell like fire, babe
I said you
And me
We
Are starting to smell like fire, chile
Ooh
Bridge:
Everybody’s alright, ooh, baby
Baby don’t you show any shame at all
My back’s up against the wall
And we’re grinding
Till it smells like fire babe
And it’s gonna burn forever
Just as long as we’re together
We’ll be grinding
'Till it smells like fire babe

Chorus:
I said you
And me
We
Are starting to smell like fire babe
I said you
And me
We
Are starting to smell like fire
I brought home scars from the battle
But a woman’s scorn is worse than any war
In my absence her heart hadn’t grown any fonder
Apparently she’s forgotten what I’m fighting for

I said I would be
Behind enemy lines
Would’ve died a thousand times
And you doubt me
Without even thinking twice
My life I’d sacrifice
But you doubt me, why
And why not acknowledge me
When I’ve been a soldier for your love

I consider you my duty
I have not come all this way not to win
Persevering for our love’s survival
Living each day just to fight again

I said I went
Behind enemy lines
Would’ve died a thousand times
But you doubt me
Why, without even thinking twice
My life I’d sacrifice
But you doubt me
And why not acknowledge me
I’ve been a soldier for your love
I said I went
Behind enemy lines
Would’ve died a thousand times
But you doubt me
Why, without even thinking twice
My life I’d sacrifice
But you doubt me
And why not acknowledge me
I’ve been a soldier for your love

Ooh our love
For the glory of love
I know exactly what I’d do
I’d fight until the death of me
And be a champion for you
I’d hike the hillside for your heart
I’d swim the seas for your soul
And I promise when I’m done
It will be the greatest love story ever told

I’d run the sands in my bare feet
Oh victory’s so sweet
For your every heartbeat
I will courageously compete
At the sound of the gun
I’ll refuse second to none
I’ll be waving my flag proudly
Once I've won

It’s the glory of love
It’s the glory of your love
The glory of love
The glory of your love
To the finish line
I finally made it
A medal of honor to commemorate it
No split decision could be debated
I hurried where the others hesitated
Let’s go where no crowd will be
So only you can be proud of me
Grab you and I hold you close
You’re the trophy that means the most

Oh baby
It’s you, it’s you
Oh baby
It’s really you

For the glory of love
For the glory of your love
For the glory of love
For the glory of love

Oh glory of love
Glory of your love
Oh glory of love
The glory of your love

[Intro: Eminem]
Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo
This song is for anyone...
Fuck it, just shut up and listen
Ayo

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension
Dispensing these sentences, getting this stress
That's been eating me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter
To not come and speak to me, I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a mothafuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick if you tempt me
My tank is on empty, no patience is in me
And if you offend me, I'm lifting you ten feet in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you, I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

[Chorus: Marilyn Manson]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Sometimes I just feel like my father
I hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense
It's constant, and, "Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses."
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city havin' this happening
Then attack Eminem ‘cause I rap this way
But I'm glad, ‘cause they feed me the fuel that I need
For the fire to burn, and it's burning, and I have returned

[Chorus: Marilyn Manson]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I'm so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name Is"
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock-n-roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
‘Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearin' it out
‘Cause they driving me crazy, I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit
In the bathroom without someone standing by it
No, I won't sign you an autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

[Chorus: Marilyn Manson]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

[Post-Chorus: Marilyn Manson (Eminem)]
Pain, pain
Pain, pain (I don't know it's just the way I am)
Pain, pain
Ahh (Radio won't even play my jam)

[Outro: Eminem]
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
'Cause I am whatever you say I am

[Verse 1]
High speed chase, 405 is the freeway
Slangin' my- bangin' my- swangin' my Coupe de Ville
Scoop DeVille
Like that, right back, top of the hill
Wheel in my hand with a trunk full of contraband
Swimmin' under water like I'm Aquaman
I used to drink gin, now it's vodka, man
Boss Dawg is the baller, no propagand'
I'll pop yo band, don't try and stop the plan
I'll rock your land, step back and pop yo man
Spaced out, caked out, no bug-a-boo
Flipped out, Cripped out, nigga, what it really do?
Time brings change, so I changed my name
Tryna take flight while they clippin' my wings
Groupie ass niggas, see you tripping again
With nothing to gain, plop plop, pop and I bang

[Chorus]
Cadillac-er, Croco-sacker
Hip-hopper, click-clacker
Tip-tapper, pimp-slapper
Ain't tryna act up, don't wanna act up
My nigga back up, nigga back up (aye back up)
Aye, baby back up, baby back up
My nigga back up, nigga back up (back up)
Hey Scoop DeVille, turn the track up

[Verse 2]
Thirty days later I'm back on the streets
Got a batch of bomb beach, shit I'm trying to eat
Feet to the pavement; money, I'm cravin' it
What about the bitches Dogg? Are you savin' 'em?
Can a blind man see? (No)
Can a shark survive outta water for a week? (No)
A snitch is a snitch if he solemnly speak
I don't know near nothin', I'm a product of the beach
To each his own, hard as stone
Lot of y'all niggas 'bout as hard as foam
Dead wrong, tryin' to sneak Tamika the phone
Step back nephew or feel the heat of the chrome
G-ma and PawPaw and the heat of my comb
Plate full of shit nigga, I never eat it alone
Heat it alone, then I put the weed in the bong
Step back at the feet of my throne mothafucka

[Chorus]
Cadillac-er, Croco-sacker
Hip-hopper, click-clacker
Tip-tapper, pimp-slapper
Ain't tryna act up, don't wanna act up
My nigga back up, nigga back up (aye back up)
Aye, baby back up, baby back up
My nigga back up, nigga back up (back up)
Hey Scoop DeVille, turn the track up

[Verse 3]
Cinematic, right back at it
Talk the walk and walk 'bout that static
I am the extra dramatic
When he popped back, everybody scattered, didn't matter
I was there from the get-go
Movin' heavy weights, Klitschko
Rookies and cookies from 'Frisco
Put 'em in a box, Nabisco
We the funk that killed disco
I showed you how to go and get this dough
And I'm the reason why you're fuckin' with this ho
But don't thank me, that's how the shit go
It's still banging Crypto from the intro
Nigga what they hidden fo'?
Hol' up, who is that tryin' to come through?
Step back and get mic checked; 1, 2

[Chorus]
Cadillac-er, Croco-sacker
Hip-hopper, click-clacker
Tip-tapper, pimp-slapper
Ain't tryna act up, don't wanna act up
My nigga back up, nigga back up (aye back up)
Aye, baby back up, baby back up
My nigga back up, nigga back up (back up)
Hey Scoop DeVille, turn the track up

[Bridge]
Grapevine, state line
Get yours, I take mine
Grapevine, state line
Get yours, I take mine

Aye, baby back up, baby back up
My nigga back up, nigga back up (back up)
Hey Scoop DeVille, turn the track up

[Verse 1]
I would never lie to you unless you tell me to
Every part of me, all my words to hold
And hold against me, why won't you let it be?

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you ever say my love, "open up your heart"
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights

[Chorus]
Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won’t you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me)

[Verse 2]
I would never break the rules unless you tell me to
You can read my mind, be it truth or lies
Lie down beside me, why won't you let it be?

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights

[Chorus]
Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me)

[Bridge]
Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights

[Chorus]
Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me)

[Verse 1]
Ooo, think I'm worried 'bout a rumor?

Aye, I forgot, I ain't seen the other side since I bought that motherfucker, wait
It's a shame, a lame's all you'll ever be

Ooo, you think I'm scared of a diss?
Aye, I think you're scared to get rich

Whoa, you start the day off by talkin' 'bout me
Everyday my birthday, you still ain't got me nothin'?

[Hook]
Yeah, I do this all the time
Aye, happy birthday, bitch, you look surprised

Yeah, aksed them bitches who gon' stop me now

[Verse 2]
Ooo, think I'm worried 'bout a rumor?

Man, a lame is all you'll ever be
Game, got the whole set reppin' me

Part Hennessy, part fuel
All I want for my birthday is more fire
More Twelve Juice, more designer
Young Halle Berry's in my theater room reclinin'
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout, you know you can't deny it

[Intro]
Woah, woah, yeah
Sizzle, yeah
My love, my love, my love
What would I do without my love?
My love, my love, my love
Listen

[Verse 1]
Lately I've been sensing there's some problems going on with us
Yeah, you and I
And baby, that's a problem I take real serious, I can't lie
It gets to me, uh
I don't know what to do but to tell you that I love you

[Refrain]
And you know this 'cause I show it
Outsiders try to blow it but I can't let it happen, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's business ain't nobody's business
In other words, they don't know half of what I go through
(To give)
Give you what you need
(To be there)
To be there for you and still do my thing
I'm talkin' 'bout music
'Cause it's what I gotta do to express how I really feel
See you write the songs, girl, and I'll just do the singing
Without you, I can't live
So heart to heart

[Chorus]
Baby, heart to heart (Baby, you're)
You're the biggest part of my needs, girl
They can tell their stories (Oh no)
What you do for me, it gets too deep, girl
What I'd do for you (You'll never know)
What they say to you (Girl, let him go)
You don't need him
You don't need him, you'd be better off hanging out with me
They try to break us up
They don't understand our love
('Cause it)
'Cause it gets too deep, girl

[Verse 2]
Check me
I know a way to make a bunch of people love me (Mmm)
If you were to leave me all by myself
As soon as we turn our way back, they hustle out
To tell someone else what's going on, yeah
Misery likes company but we're the only company
We need to be happy

[Refrain]
And you know this 'cause I show it
Outsiders try to blow it but I can't let it happen, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's business ain't nobody's business
In other words, they don't know half of what I go through
(To give)
Give you what you need
(To be there)
To be there for you and still do my thing
I'm talkin' 'bout my music
'Cause it's what I gotta do to express how I really feel
See you write the songs, girl, and I'll just do the singing
Without you, I can't live
So heart to heart

[Chorus]
Baby, heart to heart (Baby, you're)
You're the biggest part of my needs, girl
They can tell their stories (Oh no)
What you do for me, it gets too deep, girl
What I'd do for you (You'll never know)
What they say to you (Girl, let him go)
You don't need him, let him go
You don't need him, you'd be better off hanging out with me
Oh yeah
They try to break us up
They don't understand our love
('Cause it)
'Cause it gets too deep, girl

[Bridge]
Check me
(My love, my love, my love)
What would I do without your loving in my life? I don't know
(What would I do without my love?)
My love, my love, my love
Without you, I can't live, it ain't no way
(My love, my love, my love)
You're the only one I need in order to be happy
(What would I do without my love?)
Don't you ever leave me
(My love, my love, my love)
Without you, I can't live
So heart to heart
(So I gotta tell you)

[Chorus]
Baby, heart to heart (Baby, you're)
You're the biggest part of my needs, girl
(They can tell their stories)
They can tell their stories (Oh no, what you do)
What you do for me, it gets too deep, girl
What I'd do for you (You'll never know)
What they say to you (Girl, let him go)
(You don't need him, no)
You don't need him, you'd be better off hanging out with me
They try to break us up
('Cause it, 'cause it, 'cause it, 'cause it)
They don't understand our love 'cause it gets too deep, girl
(Yeah, 'cause it)

My man Chuck D
You start it off for us
It take one plan, here's the issues
FIRST~!

[Chuck D] + (KRS)
We don't control shit (second)
No education enforcement (third)
And damn sure no economics (fourth)
Dependin on governments
Forever in a plantation state (fifth)
You know why? Damn that's why I hate hate (six)
Wanna do somethin for the people, make us equal (seven)
Instead of creatures, who got human features (eight)
Image: http://static.urx.io/units/web/urx-unit-loader.gif


Let the whole world reach you (nine)
Then classrooms can't reach you (ten)
Yo T'cha (what?) Hit me, drop it now!

[KRS-One]
Yo today's topic, self-creation
You can front if you like but it's your time you wastin
It's your mind you wastin, that's why I'm replacin
Ignorance with awareness that we are a nation
Hip-hop, we create the future we facin
Man - you see what we doin, you still debatin
Still complacent, still hatin
But you'll see there is no revolution, without revelation

[Instrumental]

[Verse: Meek Mill]
Uh, Lord knows I'm filthy rich
All this ice is like 50 bricks
Rap niggas throwing hissy fits
I give my bitch a stack just for a Christmas gift
And my bitch so bad, she on my Christmas list
'Member I prayed, really I wished for this
To get the crib with the maid and with the picket fence
I'm with some niggas that mad, we taking risks for this
I'm talking,lord knows that I repent for this
But Lord knows if I get penned for this
I prolly won't get home until I'm 56
They say, I do not know why they be gassing these suckers
But fuck 'em cause I am not feeling their shit
Difference between me and most of these rappers
I'm talking about work that I really put in
Talking about pistols I put on my hip
And I'm talking about foreigns I really could whip

[Outro]
Fighting strong, fighting strong
Fighting harder, fight stronger
Fighting strong, fighting strong
Fighting harder, fight stronger
Lyrics From Snippet

[Verse]
... Couple them bodies get dropped and you niggas will tell (you niggas will tell)
And I made an M in a week but they tellin' me I took an L (I took an L, bitch, where?)

[Chorus]
Money, power, respect, eatin' breakfast on a jet
We got cash to get, carats danglin' from my neck ...

[Intro]
How many niggas you know count that shit up like Lil Boat?
How many niggas you know get that shit straight off the boat?
Niggas think we ain't balling, shit, they better check the score
All of my niggas be shooting, they bust that shit straight at your throat

[Chorus]
If you know like a know then you know that I know that niggas be hating
I can't wait 'til the day I call up moms and tell mama, I made it
I can't wait 'til the day I call up all of the people that hating
I fucked that bitch then I passed her to bro 'cause I know that you hate it
Can't wait 'til I make it
Fuck waiting, shit I'm finna take it

[Verse]
Why do these niggas be hating, these niggas be hating, these niggas be hating
I don't give a fuck about the politics, don't give a fuck about debating
Me and my brother be balling like Eli and motherfucking Peyton
All of these diamonds on Yachty, these diamonds on me, all these diamonds be skating
I watch my brother jump out the front door, he whip that pot with that bacon
Ayy, ayy, and my bitch ass fat, I told that bitch never to stop eating bacon
How many niggas you know count that shit up like Lil Boat?
How many niggas you know get that shit straight off the boat?
Niggas think we ain't balling, shit they better check the score
All of my niggas be shooting, they bust that shit straight at your throat
And they think that everything funny, I see why all these niggas jokes
I sit courtside with my brothers, I sleep in Versace covers
I fuck with that bitch with no rubber, don't give a fuck about another
I promise I do not love her, fuck her then dump her, I do not cuff her, no

[Chorus]
If you know like a know then you know that I know that niggas be hating
I can't wait 'til the day I call up moms and tell mama, I made it
I can't wait 'til the day I call up all of the people that hating
I fucked that bitch then I passed her to bro 'cause I know that you hate it
Can't wait 'til I make it
Fuck waiting, shit I'm finna take it

[Verse 1]
When I crash, when I crash
Or if I land, no matter the case
I'm all smiles, I'm all smiles
I've traveled for miles, miles and miles
For the love in the core, love in the core
Some people bore me, so fucking boring
But I'm all smiles, I'm all smiles
No matter the case, I'll be okay
When I crash, when I crash
Or if I land, no matter the case

[Chorus]
Oh when I crash, when I crash
Or if I land, no matter the case
I'm all smiles, I'm all smiles, I'm all smiles
Give a fuck what they say
And I'm all smiles, I'm all smiles, hmm

[Verse 2]
Oh if I fall, oh if I fall
Or if I glide, no matter the case
I'm all smiles, I'm all smiles
I've traveled for miles, alone in the dark
With love in the core, love in the core
Some people bore me and I'm fucking dozing
With a smirk on my face, I'm all smiles
No matter the case, I'll find a way

[Chorus]
Oh when I crash, when I crash
Or if I land, no matter the crash
When I crash, when I crash
Or if I land, no matter the case
I'm all smiles, I'm all smiles, I'm all smiles
Give a fuck what they say
I'm all smiles, I'm all smiles, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
No matter the case
My baby's alright
She just doesn't wanna see me tonight
Not for a minute
Not for a second
She says "nothin' here for you to make right"

I said "I miss you so bad"
She says

I guess I don't need her around
I just do what I do best when I'm down
Paint the problem
Into a picture
Twist my arm till I make a sound

I said "I miss you so bad"
She says
Yeah, you were scarred
And you were cryin' loud, right out in the schoolyard
And, yeah, I felt good
Everything I knew was looking just as it should
I saw the tree
Carved in it "666" and he found me
But I am no fool
I know every time I look in his eyes, he sees me too

Dry your eyes
I won't tell your mother
She won't ever discover
The things you kept under the covers
And please don't cry
I am not your brother
I am not your lover
And there is nothing wrong

[Verse 1]
This is the time to be in the moment
Ain't no room for stalling, who gon' live in the moment?
Slip inside the rhythm, let's get 'em (Yum)
Tell the world this is what I call living
As I ride in my car and I'm blinded by the lights
And we're on a quest, we're running off in the night
Got some girlies in here and we're out for love
No no, don't judge, be my friend, smoke some bud

[Pre-Chorus]
See I sell my hell
Listen to no avail
Don't bother I'm not avail
No marriage, keep the veil

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the night
Yeah, she's great for some fun
Yeah, she's dope for my head
Oh, she's good for me, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Oh she's good for me, yeah (Hmm)
Oh she's good for me (Hmm)
Oh she's good for me (Hmm)

[Verse 2]
This is the time to be in the moment
Ain't no room for stalling, who gon' live in the moment?
Slip inside the rhythm, let's get 'em (Yum)
Tell the world this is what I call living
As I ride through the stars and I'm blinded by the lights
And we're on a quest, we're running off in the night
Going up from here, and we're out for love
No no, don't budge, be my friend, be my friend

[Pre-Chorus]
I have been living in hell
Listen to no avail
Don't bother I'm not avail
No marriage, keep the veil

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the night
Yeah, she's great for some fun
Yeah, she's dope for my head
Oh, she's good for me, yeah
I'm in love with the night

Oh, she's good for me, yeah

[Skit: Beavis & Butthead]
That was cool
That kicks ass
How come it stopped? How come it's not still going?
Uh, because it was over. Beavis, this is perhaps the coolest album that has ever been made
I think you're right Butthead. Come on, come on, let's play that one again
Yeah, that would rule
Can we hear more punk rock? I'm gonna break something. Can we hear more of that stuff like that stuff was?
Hello ladies. Tonight, we bring you the greatest album that has ever been made in the history of man. It is called "Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven". Beavis, punk rock is not dead
It sure isn't. Word to Kurt. Yeah, word, Butthead, word to Kurt

[Verse 1]
We are born in the dark, born into pain
Return of the rage, return of the rage
Born in the dark, born into pain
Return of the rage, return of the rage
I got the rage pushing through my veins, listen to me
No one's home, no one's home
I can't cope, empty on hope
No one's home, no one's home
My head has been screaming, I'm stuck with these idiots
Got this rage running through my veins, listen to me

[Bridge]
Undoubtedly, no saving me
Undoubtedly, no saving me
I've gotta bleed, no saving me
I've gotta bleed, no saving me
No saving me

[Verse 2]
A warrior hurt, a warrior's pain
Return of the rage, return of the rage
A warrior cursed, a warrior's pain
Return of the rage, return of the rage
I got the rage running through my veins
No one's home, no one's home
Won't leave a note, won't leave hope
No one's home, no one's home
Oh what a nightmare, I'm done with these idiots
Got the rage pushing through my veins, listen to me

[Outro]
Born in the dark, born into pain
Return of the rage, return of the rage
Nobody's home, nobody's home
That was a warning, don't be an idiot
I will fucking bash in your brain
Listen to me, feel the blood boil in my veins

[Chorus]
And we're floating out to nowhere
No safety, fall, we'll land safely

[Verse 1]
Inadequate, feeling so unwanted (Yeah-yeah)
Think I want to disappear (Yeah-yeah)
From the fire calling (Yeah-yeah)
Damn, that is so unfair
Inadequate, feeling he is so unwanted (Yeah-yeah)
Think I want to disappear (Yeah-yeah)
From the fire calling (Yeah-yeah)
Damn, that is so unfair
How could I care? How could I care?
How could I care?

[Chorus]
And we're floating out to nowhere
No safety, fall, we'll land safely (Hmm)

[Verse 2]
Lost in my reflection, how do I chill?
Only crazy makes sense, hmm, it's starting to make sense
While I'm still
Her vagina is moist and warm
I'll keep you safe, just hold my arm
Hell is beyond the door
Heaven doesn't want one more
No more chicken sandwiches
Yes, I'll pay for the damages
I explore through the galaxy nightly, numb my body (Numb my body)
Accept yourself, except yourself
Exit yourself, access yourself

[Outro]
No safety, fall, we'll end safely
Inadequate, feeling so unwanted (Yeah-yeah)
Think I want to disappear
No safety, fall, we'll land safely

[Skit: Beavis and Butthead]
"That song was kinda freaking me out, Butthead. 'And we're floating out in nowhere...'"
"No safety, fall, we will land safely, Beavis."
"Kind of makes me think about my life, you know?
"What life?"
"Yeah, yeah, exactly. The part like, you know, 'we're floating out in nowhere...'"
"Don't worry, Beavis, we will land safely."
"How come you're talking like that, Butthead?"
"Like what?"
"Come on, stop it."
"I'm not talking any differently than I normally talk, Beavis. Take some of these mushrooms that Cudi gave us, they'll make you feel better."
"Stop talking like that, Butthead."
"Like what, Beavis?"
"You're freaking me out."
"Take some mushrooms, Beavis. Take some."
"Oh boy, these mushrooms suck. But they're fast acting, aren't they? These taste horrible."
"Eat them all, Beavis."
"They're doing something. Hold on a second. Give me some more."
"Come with me, Beavis, to burning man. Take some."

Can someone, anyone give me candy?
Someone, anyone give me candy (Mary)

[Verse 1]
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
You aren't going to cut it
Scary, scary, growing weary
Chop, chop, chop it up, cut it
Eerie, eerie, darkness nearing
No one hears you suffer
Purely, purely, there's no curing

Chasing something, don't know what
The nothing, the nothing

Oh, beware of the manic man
A man can equal bandstand
Rip faces up with my bare hands

Pardon me babe, there are instructions I think that you should read
I'm a madman, I cause problems that I truly never mean
I'm damaged, I trust no one, sometimes I can be real mean
To a magnitude extreme, I'm sorry but

[Chorus]
Handle with care, so fragile and delicate
Handle with care, I'm so fragile and delicate
Handle with care, so fragile and delicate
Handle with care, here's your warning

[Verse 2]
Pardon me babe, there are instructions I think that you should read
My heart it has no shell, I can sense everything
I love from deep inside, but there are pains I hope to fix
I have no bag of tricks, it's just you should

[Chorus]
Handle with care, so fragile and delicate
Handle with care, I'm so fragile and delicate
Handle with care, so fragile and delicate
Handle with care, here's your warning

Beavis: "I don't know, Butthead. I'm feeling kind of... I don't know."
Butthead: "Wuss."
David Van Driessen: "Come on, Butthead, m'kay? Sometimes when you have a very powerful artist like Cudi, it's possible that his songs invoke certain emotions and feelings and those feelings are valid, m'kay? You know, another thing that brings up some of these feeling is hallucinogens, which I know both of you have been doing, m'kay? So why don't you just sort of relax and maybe take this as an opportunity to meditate, m'kay? Go inside yourselves, look inward"
Butthead: "Yeah Beavis, look inward. Look up your butt."
Beavis: "Shut up Butthead, your vibe's all wrong. You're not on the same frequency, butthole. You just don't get it Butthead, you just don't get it."

Wondering if you could possibly help me
I'm looking for something, I need a fix
I need something that will give me a little bit of a boost
Wondering if you could possibly help me
I'm looking for something, I need a fix
I need something that will give me a little bit of a boost

Yeah
Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos

Them weirding things are vicing
Till I finally say alright
Never will I close my eyes
I like to see my speaker smile (Oh)
Hello birdie, what's the wording?
How do you do, how do you play?
Climb your mountain, think you're a fountain
Don't you get to ride my face
Play the teacher, I'll play the student
Play the asshole on stage
Play the clitoris code is morse
A thousand thank you's way too late (What's the case?)

[Outro]
Through the agony and strife, I see my so called stinking life
Through the agony and strife, I see my so called stinking life

The darkness is coming
And guess what it's wanting
Fools start running
Dead man walking

[Intro]
I can't get numb enough
I don't wanna know what's down or up
I need to escape forever, forever
I need to escape forever, forever

[Verse 1]
The clouds stay gray
The devil wants to play, okay?
The devil wants to play, okay?
She likes to feed on the weak
Locking in on her prey
Dissolve your soul, fingertips turn cold

[Chorus]
I need to escape forever, forever
I need to escape forever, and ever

[Verse 2]
Blood everywhere, blood everywhere
My outfit's fresh, of course it is
You said we do this to death
Cold until my last breath, slowly exhale
One last fuck you to the world
One last fuck you to the world

[Chorus]
I need to escape forever, forever
I need to escape forever, and ever
I need to escape forever, forever
I need to escape forever, and ever

[Outro]

You can't escape me, I will destroy you

Beavis: "You know Butthead, I say this a lot, but that was cool."
Butthead: "What a long strange trip it has been."
Beavis: "It sure has. I feel all different."
Butthead: "Beavis, the world will never be the same. Doves will fly into the sunset and there will be harmony, and there will be rainbows. There will be peace on earth. And there will be no haters, and if there are haters, we shall flex on them. We shall flex on them hard."
Beavis: "Flex on, yeah."
Butthead: "And finally we will score, the whole world will score. It's gonna be cool."
Beavis: "Really? We're gonna score? Are you sure? Wait a minute, are you sure? Because I always think I'm gonna score, and then it doesn't happen. And I don't want to get my hopes up because I'm all like, emotional right now."
Butthead: "Yes, Beavis, it is foretold."
Beavis: "Yeah, cool, that's good. Butthead, a minute ago you said 'hard.'"
Butthead: "Oh, yeah."

[Verse 1]
Oh if I crash, oh if I crash
Or if I land, no matter the case
I'm all smiles, I'm all smiles

With love in the core, love in the core
Some people bore me, so fucking boring
But I'm all smiles, I'm all smiles
No matter the case, I'll be okay

[Chorus]
When I crash, when I crash
Or if I land, no matter the case

Some people bore me and I'm fucking dozing
With a smirk on my face, I'm all smiles
No matter the case, I'll find a way

Oh when I crash, when I crash
Or if I land, no matter the case

Oh beautiful horror, this is a beautiful horror
This is another story of another anomaly
We'll make it gory, the ears will bleed

Get myself a new friend

Get myself a new friend
Ya she is shoe in
No she's not a nuisance
Get myself a new friend
New friend

[Verse]
She looks for comfort in whoever
He has to have someone forever
For all of her nights for all of her days
For all of the wet sex and all of the ways
I hate myself but I wanna fix it
She hates herself but wants to fix it
The evils want to nix it, it could be working
Or it could be worth it, I think it's worth it
Her love is worth it and ya she knows that
There's levels to this shit and ya she knows that
Repent for being bent, repent for being spent
Repent for leaving, repent for leaving dents
I hate myself but I wanna fix it
She hates herself but wants to fix it
It could be worth it, it could be worth it
Love her, love her, yow, I love her
Oh, baby,  baby electric eyes piercing through me
She said she not worthy
Oh baby cut it with them lies what you want from me
Oh girl I'm not worthy

[Chorus]
No way, no way
She said she's not worthy
No way, no way
Oh girl I'm not worthy

[Verse]
She looks for comfort in whoever
He has to have someone forever
For all of her nights for all of her days
For all of the wet sex and all of those ways
I hate myself but I want to fix it
She hates herself but wants to fix it
The evils want to nix it, it could be working
Or it could be worth it, it could be working
Her love is worth it and ya she knows this
There's levels to this shit and yes he has to know that
Repent for being bent, repent for being spent
Repent for being a dick, repent for leaving dents
I hate myself but I want to fix it
She hates herself but wants to fix it
He could be worth it, it could be worth it
Love her, love her
Oh baby, baby electric eyes piercing through me
She said she's not worthy
Oh baby, baby don't tell lies what you want from me
Oh girl I'm not worthy

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Why, why, why, why

No doubt about it I'm melting, ooh melting
World full of wonder if you open those eyes
Shed yourself, get out the disguise
Slow mo we all want acceptance
Truth, fuck that, get off that
Accept truth, be free, and carry on baby
Hey

[Verse 2]
No doubt about it I'm crumbling, ooh crumbling
No issue I got it, X-Ray through the lies
To enter the void got to lose more of your mind
It happens the same old downward spiral
And I weep, to sleep, give it all I've got in the morning
Oh, so good night my baby
Instant pain, hey

At least I can hear the rain
Had a message to deliver
To a house on Britney Lane
But I'm just stuck here by your window
Oh, look how you have changed

[Produced by Alex 'AK' Kresovich & Sonny J Mason]

[Chorus 1]
Why won't you give me a reason why?
Babe, I'm begging you please
Oh, I suppose the redder the rose
The many more thorns, baby
The more thorns you find

[Verse 1]
Of the bouquet I chose
The most beautiful rose
And with my love I proposed
And round and round it goes
And up from the ground it grows
Eventually dies so slow
That's why I need to know

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
I find it hard to face
The one rose I put in a vase
Not knowing you need more space
Reminds me that I can feel
Reminds me that I can still heal
Cause I smell your fragrance still
And I always will

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Won't you give me a reason why?
You're making a grown man cry
I suppose the redder the rose
The many more thorns, baby
The more thorns you find

[Bridge]
They say that real men are not supposed to cry
Next time give me fake roses so they'll never die

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 1]
Stuck in a daydream
Under a moonbeam
Head on my pillow at home
Drunk are the people
Outside my window
Full of testosterone

[Chorus]
When I get trouble my way
Like paper mâché
They stick to chimera balloon
And I kick it out my door, ooh
Paper mâché dream balloon

[Verse 2]
Are you eluding
That I am brooding
Moping around on my own
Stuck in a daydream
Under a moonbeam
Head on my pillow at home

[Chorus]
When I get trouble my way
Like paper mâché
They stick to chimera balloon
And I hide it in my drawer, ooh
Paper mâché dream balloon
Paper mâché dream balloon

[Outro]
When I get trouble my way
Like paper mâché
I stick them to a dream balloon
And I kick it out my door
And I hide it in my drawer
Sarah runs
To feel the burning in her lungs
And clear her head
Do you know what Sarah meant

When she said
You
Be my guest
And keep the pace
To save your face
You'll never make
The place
Why do you even run the race?

I can't be
What you need
I am stuck in a dream
I am stuck in a dream

Don't you know
She's been here all along
In a dream?
She belongs in a dream
Every day
I'll make promises that plague
Sarah's heart
So I can watch her fall apart

'Cause I know
When I break her down
We'll spit on all the happy clowns
That live around this sunny town
She loves me like a dog
And when we mess around
I'll let her know the truth I found
In my own hopeless hate
And every time I wake
I second guess the game I played
Did I make a mistake?
All I want to do is get a little bit closer to you
But you, you're like glue
I'm like water and you're like glue
And all I ever do is soak through you

All I want to do is get a little bit closer to you
But you, you're like glue
I'm like water and you're like glue
I'm like water and you're like glue
And all I ever do is soak through you

[Intro]
Face ass

[Verse]
Sippin' on this lean, I'm off my balance beam, yeah
Sippin' on this lean, I'm off my, yeah
Sippin' on this lean, I'm off my balance beam
Doin' all this dirt and never plantin' seeds
Fuckin' all these hoes and never wifin' one
Fuckin' all these hoes I bet your wife is one
Fuckin' all these hoes and wifin' all of 'em
They say Tunechi hit the coke and I say aw, fuck it
Then I pull the molly out and look what I got
Then she stick her tongue out like some high tops
Then she stick her tongue out like some high tops
Eyes bloodshot red like she cyclops
Flag bloodshot red, when we mob out
Shoot you right up in your head between your eye brows
And then my young niggas break in your trap house
Trigger finger ichin' like it's in an ant pile
I'm just sippin' on this lean, I'm off my balance beam
Standin' and speakin' could be so challenging
Got these niggas in save mode
They know I'm in ape mode
They don't come up to my cage close
Whats the code to that safe though?
Get the chips and dip like queso
Body niggas then lay low
Don't come out til that case closed
Snortin' lines til her face froze
Sittin' on top of yayo
Sittin' on bread like mayo
Like butter on top of beagle
Like tomatoes or egg yo
Hustle like I'm dead broke
Bullshit got my head hurt
Tec-9 in my pants leg
I'm limpin' harder than Fred Durst
I just wanna tie you to the bed and give you head girl
I know that I probably be goin' over your head girl
I'mma make it storm on your head girl
Goin' hard, gettin' laid all day
Been goin' hard all day
Wish a nigga would fuck with me
Then I blow the candles out on my cake
I blow your head off, no call or no stray
No barkin' dogs or stray
I just ordered all the D'usse
Blow a hundred G's without panicking
My homie trafficking, he just savaging
I'm really playin' with money, you just tampering
You playin' with your life, why you gambling?
I'm fuckin' on your wife while you scrambling
I say who this pussy for, she say your majesty
I pull out a bag of white and she hit that and sneeze
She gone cut that nigga off, he an amputee
Now she really bout that life
She the one for me
And every time we see them lights
She hold that gun for me
And every time a package come she sample some for me
She ain't no actress but I got her actin' up for me
And all my niggas in cake mode
All my niggas in Tec mode
Red beam on your face, you look like Rudolph with the red nose
Tunechi rockin' red though
Slit my wrists and I bled gold
Quick to finnessee a bitch
My gift of gab came with a red bow
When I
Just wanna tie you to the bed and give you head girl
And I, I know I'm probably going over your head girl
And fuck your nigga
He ain't doin' shit, I done said worse
Dirty south, that red dirt
Drive down with that work boy
You ain't leavin' here til I weigh it first
Choppa make your head burst
Oh, lil mama with the head work
She suck my dick till my leg jerk
She swallow that shit, then burp
Swallow that shit, then burp
I fucked her best friend first
Her boyfriend be gettin' on her last nerve
Pussy ass nigga need a pap smear
Pussy ass nigga need a pap smear
All my niggas need cash first
Fresh pair of Vans and a plaid shirt
Skateboard, snowboard, and surf
Lord I'm' on my wave all day
Squad boys all day
Wish a nigga would fuck with us
We'll blow the smile off of his face
Gettin' paid  all day

This beach city nigga
Huh? what?
This beach city nigga
Huh? what?
This beach city nigga
(You know we had to do a remix)
Huh? what?
This beach city nigga

[Verse 1]
Long Beach done come together now you know you in trouble
If you came in to the beach without Snoop D-O double
Look, we hear the haters talking that don't mean that we listen
I'm to busy chasing dreams I don't see competition
Daisy Dukes bitch cruises through the city
And that ass fat make that bike pop a wheelie
All my bitches pretty, tough as a diddy
If you ain't with the movement get your ass out the city
Bitch really

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
Bang my city, my city we bang
This ain't nothing but a long beach thing
All my homies they got my back
Talk that smack and I'mma peel you back

[Verse 2]
Yes, mind over matter grind over chatter
Deck not full, call me Mad Hatter
Jumped in the rabbit hole mission is the carrots
On my bullshit colonel strife with the merits
Cut from the cloth of a boss I inherit
Don't sleep I'm tied to these streets like a marriage
Loyal on my ring finger love on my middle
Faith on my index I need it when I scribble, uh
Different bitch every day like I'm civil
But you would never catch him on a leash in my kenal
Cola doesn't save him cola doesn't cape
Cola feed him kibble real bitches relate
I am not a quitter nor will I ever equate
Push my own line for the west of the state
Scooped up the game laid it out on my plate
Queen of the west this ain't up for debate

[Hook]
This beach city nigga
Huh? what?
This beach city nigga
Huh? what?
This beach city nigga
Huh? what?
This beach city nigga

[Verse 3]
Yeah, and you know Long beach did it
But we ain't dropping name nigga this ain't no attendance
These niggas be in conversations talking about they business
But if you knew better you'd be talking about your dividends
I ain't got no friends, they be acting funny
It's cool in the beginning but if they ain't getting money
End it soon cause motherfuckers don't wanna see you boom
They don't want to give lots of credit where credit is due
I take them to school, but they don't show me no love
They just stalk my instagram and wait for me to hoe up
That'll be the day you niggas petty you forgetting
You used to be making investments into the future nigga, beach

[Hook]
This beach city nigga
Huh? what?
This beach city nigga
Huh? what?
This beach city nigga
Huh? what?
This beach city nigga

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
Bang my city, my city we bang
This ain't nothing but a long beach thing
All my homies they got my back
Talk that smack and I'mma peel you back

[Verse 4]
I'm from north side Long Beach
Know a couple niggas from the gang
But I ain't saying names cause that's dry snitching
You fucking with a cold killer when I start spitting
Your mind vivid, I blind vision with my lyrics
We on a mission to get it, I'm concentrating on digits
Can't pay attention to bitches, these niggas stay in they feelings
Cause now they see I'm the realest
I'm going in I be killing shit, you feeling it?
Long Beach City bitch

[Verse 5]
N-A to the motherfucking E
Yelling checkmate I be the queen of the beach
If the sky is the limit guess I'm looking like the clouds
Only smoking if it's loud like you bitches run you down
Trying to get mills so my fam can say grace
Put my heart up in this shit, like I'm rapping to my pace
I'm at my post like a Joker I'm no joke
Smoke that shit that's at your neck like a rope
Get it? you choke
Niggas thirsty thumbing, I'm his puss-iera mist, ah
Make that pussy nigga give me bills not talking rent
Top put him to bead like the head on a pillow
Married to the money
Dead presidents got me looking like I'm widowed

[Hook]
This beach city nigga
Huh? what?
This beach city nigga
Huh? what?
This beach city nigga
Huh? what?
This beach city nigga

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
Bang my city, my city we bang
This ain't nothing but a long beach thing
All my homies they got my back
Talk that smack and I'mma peel you back

[Verse 1]
I'm feeling kind of low
I've listened to your song
I wish I enjoyed it 'til it reached my soul
You try to read my thoughts
I hope you don't get close
Promise it would hurt me more than you know

[Verse 2]
My feelings overflow
I had fun before
I decided more, after you let me go
Endless, endless flaws
All I do is for us
You do miss me but you won't

[Chorus]
It seems like I'm getting old
Feels like our sun has gone
It seems like you're almost gone
It feels like it's all my fault

[Verse 3]
If you try to read my thoughts
I hope you don't get close
Promise it would hurt me more than you know

False alarm

[Chorus]
It seems like I'm getting old
It feels like our sun has gone
It seems like your love is gone
It feels like it's all my fault

[Verse 1]
She's asking me over, so I told her
I would
Last time it was easy, it was always
So good
But it's different now
Since he's been coming 'round
(Oh baby)
I'll find a way to drop it from downtown

[Chorus]
Looks like I put up a brick again
I can feel it
(He's heating up!)
Got stole and then he jammed it in
I can see it
(He's heating up!)
One lonely shot no good for two
But I need it
(He's heating up!)
You wanna hold onto him too
(He's on fire!)

[Verse 2]
So I get by a bucket, 'til my luck hits
Goddamn
Is it real what I'm seein'? Could it be him?
My man
I rejected
He headfakes and I'm down
(Just maybe)
I'll find a way to put it up from downtown

[Chorus]
Looks like I put up a brick again
I can see it
(He's heating up!)
Got stole and then he jammed it in
I can feel it
(He's heating up!)
One ugly shot no good for two
But I need it
(He's heating up!)
You wanna hold onto him too
(He's on fire!)

You see how fresh these shoes is? These is not no Air Force Ones
Step up on the stage with my mouth on froze
Bathing apes on my feet put the crowd on hold

[Intro]
I do not talk, I am just a rapper

[Verse]
I am so different, being me is like the lottery
I am so on like the TV when you fall asleep
Niggas makin pottery, but I broke the mold
Now my shit has got them dancing like a baby Oakenfold
Yes, I got a lust for life, and I drink my weight in whiskey
And these hoes are actin' different cause I'm Rich comma Richie
These friends are iffy, they're alcoholic geniuses
I think they hang around until I'm drunk and buy them Guinnesses
I gotta drink my medicine to cover what's inside of me
I'm still fucked up from the days nobody liked me
I'm lying just a little when I say that I don't give a fuck
You know I gotta give a fuck
You know I gotta give a fuck
My face is broken out
My shirt is hand-me-down
This kid named Vincent wanna take my shirt and lay me out
I'm trying to fit in like a fat bitch in her shoe size
It's funny how I'm flyer now than witches on their broom rides
I always thought these new clothes were the potion
Cause I never felt that good in my own skin
It's probably cause I'm the only black kid in my school
And when I meet another black kid they tell me I'm a fool
Cause I wear these tight clothes, tight jeans, tight shirt
Yeah I stay tight like these girls that make my dick hurt
Yeah, I'm self conscious
Go ahead, laugh it up
Cause I dig deep and pull something out to back it up
They told my ass to blacken up
What the fuck are you?
You don't even say shit
Quit writing gay shit
Now they see me, have to squint like Asians
Cause I'm too bright like an old night light
When I do not talk, I am being polite
Rap all night
Act all day
Mama so scared 'imma waste away
I don't have time to sleep
I don't have time to eat
These niggas got time to do
Everything but be unique
I gotta do me like I'm jerkin' to a mirror
I am just a rapper
Can't make it clearer
To every kid in a world full of pain
Please give a listen to this song and my name
Childish Gambino
We are all children
I am just a murderer
Man, I just killed this

[Intro: Trey Songz]
Yeah, she a freak

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
She said she like it when I'm nasty
So I'ma give her what she ask for

And she gon' suck it 'til her jaw sore, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Drinkin' your juice like a liquor

Chop that peach up like a blender
She feel me deep in her chest
Top of the morn', she give me top

Dug in that pussy, you runnin', you runnin'
When I'm nasty, I don't even care
Pull it if it's fake or your real hair

And she gon' suck it 'til her jaw sore
Incredible neck, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Chop that peach up like a blender
She feel me deep in her chest
Top of the morn', she give me top
I be so deep in her neck

Up in that pussy like I thought it was a trap
She let me do whatever when I'm diggin' her out
Hang her head off the bed, told her keep it right there
I fuck her face, she let me spit all in her mouth
Then I put my fingers in her holes in and out
Pretty motherfucker suck her soul right out
I got that pussy on my lips like Chapstick
I beat that pussy like my grandma did bad kids

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You know your walls will remember me
You know your walls won't forget me
You know your walls will remember me
You know your walls won't forget me

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
She said she like it when I'm nasty
I told her sit on my face
So I'ma give her what she ask for
Let a nigga get a taste
Beat the pussy in the backseat
Backseat of my Jeep
And she gon' suck it 'til her jaw sore
Do it like a real freak, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Drinkin' your juice like the liquor
I eat that pussy for breakfast
Chop that peach up like a blender
She feel me deep in her chest

You know your walls will remember me
You know your walls won't forget me
Your walls will remember me
Your walls won't forget me
Walls will remember me
Walls will

[Verse 4: Chisanity & MIKExANGEL]
Got my fingers in that pussy like a gun
You so pretty girl, I love to watch you cum
She go crazy, she go stupid, she go dumb
She bring her friends 'cause without homies ain't no fun
No partition but she want it in the backseat
Fuck around, fuck around and get her ass eat
Can't be shy girl, that's my name, I like it nasty
She drippin' spit all on that dick, I grip her ass cheeks
That's my bitch, I call her that and she don't mind
She back it up, I smack it up and we rewind
Empty out my balls, get my name called
Since I came girl, I knock it out the frame walls

[Hook: Trey Songz & MIKExANGEL]
You know your walls will remember me
You know your walls won't forget me
You know your walls will remember me
You know your walls won't forget

[Lyrics from Snippet]

Said one, two, three, four, five
I just wanna, I just wanna spend the night
With you love
Oh you, love
Said one, two, three, four, five
I just wanna, I just wanna spend the night
With you love
Oh you love

Girl don't worry 'bout nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing
Oh, when you used to worry about the little things
Girl don't worry 'bout nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing

Babe, I'll take control
I'll hold you close to me, and I won't let you go
And I got your back, babe, and I won't let you go
I'll hold you close to me, and I won't let you go

[Chorus]
I been ballin' so long, but I don’t want no problems
Keep that FN in reach, but I don’t want no problems
Hundred thousand worth of crosses, I don’t want no problems
I know every lock on Slauson, but I don’t want no problems
Pullin up on YSL, these young niggas got problems
They can’t beat me with that wooly, they gon' swear it’s a problem
I’ma slide down your hood when you and your girl havin' problems
OG bag ‘pose to be in, what the world is the problem?

[Verse 1]
I'ma wrap my money it look like Oprah Winfrey
I'ma sell one of my mansions, everything new but the kitchen
Ain’t no cypher nor no wrestler, but a rappin' invention
And I'm master selling them P’s, now my money no limit
I got my bread up, no, shut up, don’t let up
No police, I’m fed up, they cannot forget us
I got your schedule, I fuck up your schedule
I shoot at your head, your dreads, they dye us
These bitches just know it’s too hard to get by us
I’m not advertisin' but boy you can try us
I sang to your bitch and she call me Mariah
I see and read everything 'round me but bibles
Bugatti I swear, I’m not gonna hurt anybody, I swear
I’m not gonna tell anybody
Just take this molly and stand right beside me
I’m with PeeWee Longway
You know every day a long day
You know I’m not Kanye, but I been rockin' since the first day

[Chorus]
I been ballin' so long, but I don’t want no problems
Keep that FN in reach, but I don’t want no problems
Hundred thousand worth of crosses, I don’t want no problems
I know every lock on Slauson, but I don’t want no problems
Pullin up on YSL, these young niggas got problems
They can’t beat me with that wooly, they gon' swear it’s a problem
I’ma slide down your hood when you and your girl havin' problems
OG bag ‘pose to be in, what the world is the problem?

[Verse 2]
Pull up in that new coupe then drop the roof (Woo)
Take your boo and then attend to her like a boo
She love my dirty drawers even though I'm a crew
I love her even though I know lil' mama's swoo
Cop a Rollie then I Kawasaki ride a bike (Bitch)
Keep a pint, I'ma throw you my bro he white, he white
You not on my level, cause I, I done got my straddles up
Woke up with a nice, bad bitch inside my bed like fuck
Aye, I'ma trip across and stick 'em up
Don't play

[Chorus]
I been ballin' so long, but I don’t want no problems
Keep that FN in reach, but I don’t want no problems
Hundred thousand worth of crosses, I don’t want no problems
I know every lock on Slauson, but I don’t want no problems
Pullin up on YSL, these young niggas got problems
They can’t beat me with that wooly, they gon' swear it’s a problem
I’ma slide down your hood when you and your girl havin' problems
OG bag ‘pose to be in, what the world is the problem?

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Sometimes I get high to free my mind
Is that alright?
Right, right, right, right
Sometimes I get drunk, to pass the time
Is that alright? Is that alright?
Right, right, right, right

[Hook (x2)]
Let’s roll up somethin’, let’s pour up somethin’
Let’s roll, let’s pour, let’s roll up somethin’
Let’s pour up somethin’

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Sometimes I get high to get you off my brain
Is that alright?
Right, right, right, right
Sometimes I like to get wasted
Sometimes I like to get faded
Sometimes I... wait, I forgot what I was finna say
Right, right, right, right

[Hook (x3)]
Let’s roll up somethin’, let’s pour up somethin’
Let’s roll, let’s pour, let’s roll up somethin’
Let’s pour up somethin’

[Verse]
Before the hoes was ever noticin’, bank was broken, full of overages
Crucified for my outspokeness, my heart was cold, it’s so emotionless
Hear, hear, hear, hear, I can’t hear my own thoughts
Hell yeah, yeah, yeah, silence every phone call
Too much thinkin’ and too much time in the attic
Too much drinkin’ and too much weed for my habit
Too much passion and too much swag for the average
Don’t need to explain if you can’t change what happened
Uh, loose handshakes and fake smiles
More knives in my back than a steakhouse
Feelin’ like Em in Eight Mile
Lose yourself right now, I’m spaced out
Friends pretendin’ they ain’t enemies
Haters be whisperin’ cause they envious
Know all the pain I got in my memories
Who got the pill that they had it limitless?
Now who says, now who says I can’t get stoned?
Now who cares, now who cares who’s right, who’s wrong?
If you find it, be clear, a new life with new air
A new flight with new stairs, you might move on
And get faded, you might move on and upgrade it
You might move on and just get the bullshit out of the way
Right, right, right, right

[Hook (x2)]
Let’s roll up somethin’, let’s pour up somethin’
Let’s roll, let’s pour, let’s roll up somethin’
Let’s pour up somethin’
Right, right, right, right

[Intro]

Woo, one xan, one xan, one xan, lord, I'm tryna cut back
Hold up, hold up, where my cup at? My bitch got that comeback
Woo, real one from the jump, man, I'm killing the Jumpman
I ain't got no ceilings, no need to look up, man (uh-uh)

Been a stuntman since a young man, extra gun if one jam (bap-bap)
Stuntman since a young man, extra gun if one jam
On my Carter 5 shit, this one for the thumb, man

Gun-Blam, Gun-Blam, Gun-Blam, Gun-Blam, Gun-Blam, Gun-Blam
Shh... silence on the gun, I go Silence of the Lamb
Ooh I'm up man, up man, them Viagras got me up, man
And we pull up, man up and dump and dump and dump then scrrram
Screech! The harder I fall, the farther I reach
The water might fall, but life is a beach
When my number’s called, I get out my seat
When my niggas ball, I give em my speech
You might hit a wall, or end up like me
You might have to crawl, but get up like me
And you bite before bark, never I before we
And you pray before eating and you lay with your heat
And you stay with your heat and you lay on your mink
Bitches lay at your feet and you play with your kids
You don’t play with these niggas, don’t play on these streets
I don’t play on these beats, I don’t play bout my money
You heard what I say, no replay, no repeat
Don’t be playing with me, don’t be playing with we
I don’t play with no Wii, I’m OK, I’m OG
I’m O.J. on these beats, I OD on these beats
I'm M-O-B-B-B-B on these streets
Say what you say, you don’t be on these streets
Cause if we see you, it’s on S-I-G-H-T
Belie'e that, Tunechi

[Verse 2]
One xan, one xan, one xan, all I need is one xan
Knock me out like punch bag, got me slump like humpback (gone)
Muddy-muddy-muddy, I just drunk a mud bath
Muddy-muddy-muddy, I need me some mud flaps (sippin)
Real one from the jump, man, real one from the jump, man (real one)
On my Carter 5 shit, this one for the thumb, man (ayy)
Money long, I got that money tall like Kazam (Shaq)
I just popped a combo, ain’t talkin' McDonald’s (medicine)
I just popped a bottle, ain’t talkin' no liquor (medicine)
I’m talking Actavis, I’m talking to the sippers (pour up)
I’m talkin to a stripper, she gon let me pimp her
You talkin to the police, so that’s who you tippin'?
Ohhh, that’s a no-no, that’s a no-no, ohhh
Had coke since Polo and Girbauds (yeah!)
Had coke since Arsenio
White girl, Marilyn Monroes, Demi Moore
I’m in LA with my skinny hoes
But their faces look like centerfolds
I've been taking all these chemicals, damn
Now they faces aren’t identical, damn
Watch these niggas turning into hoes, bop-bop
Watch me turn a nigga into smoke, bop-bop
Watch me turn a million into four, voilà
Watch me turn Miami to N.O., uh-huh
Watch me turn the sand to some snow, uh-huh
In a Phantom with Chinchilla floors, drop-top
Hit Atlanta like Gorilla Zoe
Holla at my baby mamas, I love them the most
Shout out Lauren on the West, she playin' her role (Boogie!)
Literally, on the set, she playin' a role (Boogie!)
Niggas really rep the set, we stay in our mode (turned up)
Spiritually I’m just blessed, I pray for my hoes (amen)
Tunechi hoppin off the jet, G open my door (thank you)
Spittin since Das EFX, my flow in control (skibbidy)
Pimpin since Das EFX, my ho in control (pimpin)
And I just popped a combo, ain’t talkin McDonald’s
Niggas hear that click-clack, ooh-ooh
I know I'mma get my shit back, ooh-ooh
We aiming this thing at your body
We aiming this thing at your nose
Hollow tip bullets, blue tip bullets
Well, you’re gonna get shot with them both
Thank you for the time I've been given
Thank you to everybody for your love and kindness, for your honesty and persuasion
Thank you for telling me how it is but entertaining what I wanted it to be
Thank you for listening and for letting me into your lives again

Love Adele x

[Chorus]
My name is, my name is
My name is, Weezy Baby, and I'm high
Like maintenance, I'm smokin'
I'm drankin', leanin' daily, like, hi
My name is, you know what my name is
Bitch, I'm famous, like Tom Brady
And hi, your name is? Not important
Who cares? Not Weezy Baby, uh

[Verse 1]
Wake up, I see bad bitch, bad bitch, bad bitch
Makeup on my pillows make me mad, bitch
Without no makeup, I see that bitch as just average
Uber, Uber, Uber, Uber, Taxi
Looking at my Rollie, I got boogers on my Rollie
'Bout to hook up with my whoadies
Got the hook up on that codeine
Got the sugar for your nose ring
Got the blooka, I'm reloading
And according to my darling this dick feels so damn rewarding
I'm reporting out of shorty, she so naughty, me so horny
Kilo on me like I'm Tony, break it down to Rice-A-Roni
Take her out, look like she lonely, I'm gon' candlelight the moment
I'ma vandalize the pussy, she told him "My phone was roaming"
She be moaning 'til the morning, I be goin' in
I be on it, I be in it, I'm like Foreman on the grill
And I got doormen at the entrance
They got pistols in they trenches
They got rituals, religion
And I'm like, bitch, you know I'm sipping
'Til I die

[Chorus]
My name is, Lil Wayne, bitch
Weezy, F. Baby, ha
Her name went, from whatever-it-was
To "Lil Wayne's bitch", now that's crazy
And I, I camed in, regained strength
Rebanged it, rotation
Her guy, he's nameless, he ain't shit
Always on the same shit, poor baby

[Verse 2]
I pour up so much they call me Pour Baby
Kush man, I need a sack like Charles Haley
Sipping to the Big Moe, I'm the Barr Baby
Sip got me moving slow but my thoughts racing, err!
My long days give me short patience
My heart vacant, awards taken
What in tarnation? No information, no statements
Young mula, old mula, mula all ages
Ha-Hallelujah, I'm the Hollygrove 2Pac
Roc-A-Fella, new rock, hundred K in a shoebox
AK and a new Glock go wap-ba-ba-loo-bop
Pray the vest you got save you like a coupon
Hustle 'til my dreadlock is grey as some Poupon
Every day is my birthday, I'm a newborn
Stay on my toes, ask a shoe horn, I ain't got no roof on
Gettin' my No Ceilings 2 on

[Chorus]
And hi, I'm brainless, I'm stainless
Entertainment, his lady
And, um, if she ain't thick, then she ain't it
I can't fuck wit' a slim lady
I tried, but Superhead keep complaining
Bitch ancient, bitch shady and she tired
Okay then, I'm skatin'
Doing tricks, call me 'trick Swayze

[Verse 3]
Okay, In other news and other niggas' hoes
Your wife taste like Honey Nut Cheerios
I'm in the mirror, like "Ooh, baby"
Who needs a miracle when I got you, baby?
Pimping in my last life, I'm the shit you ass-wipe
Beat the pussy, cat fight, my teeth look like a flashlight
Weed is like a airline, 'cause easily I'm that high
Fistful of money, mix some green in with your black eye
Greedy like a fat guy, I'll eat a nigga franchise
I beat him by a landslide, a leader like a rabbi
I'm leading by halftime, he bleeding, I'm a vampire
His body in the trunk with his feet all on my Alpines
We the niggas, that's right, we all that and fries
Y'all on standby, my broads got cat eyes
Traphouse land lines, boom like land mines
All my bitches allies with Tune on their backsides

[Chorus]
So hi, my name is, on her anus
On her cranium, bitch cravin'
And I'm fly, and I'm wavy
And her name is Bust It Baby
And hi, my name is in your mouth, it must be tasty
Gone!

[Intro]
I used to
I used to
Used to

[Chorus 1]
I used to call you from the jail phone
And you would press one and receive my love
I used to call her from a jail phone
Every day like she's my plug
I used to call you from the jail phone
And you would press one and receive my love
Call her from the jail phone
Every day like she's my plug
And she know when that hotline bling, yeah
To look down at her diamond ring, yeah
I said she know when that hotline bling, yeah
It's time to drop everything

[Verse 1]
But ever since you got them titties you
Talkin' 'bout you thinkin' 'bout some ass shots
Taking all these snapshots, different backdrops
Dancing, posting pics after you cash out
Ever since you got them titties you
Been ignoring my calls and my iMessage
Saying you feel like one of my side bitches
So I pop a molly and I cry with you

[Chorus 2]
I used to call you from a jail phone
And you would press one and receive my love
Would call you from a jail phone, hey
Every day like she's my plug
I used to call you from the jail phone
And you would press one and receive my love
Call her from a jail phone
Every day like she's my plug
And she know when that hotline bling, huh
Just look at that diamond ring, yeah
She know when that hotline bling, yeah
It's time to drop everything

[Verse 2]
But ever since I left the prison you do you
You never ever try to lock me down
Remember when you used to always hold me down
You used to promise me that you'd be holding out
You used to send me naked pictures too-ooh-ooh-ooh
Now you saying you gettin' older now
Young nigga like me used to show you out
You hangin' in circles you wouldn't go around
Sneaky hoes record me on their cell phone, damn
So everyone can see my love
I used to be your ringtone
I had you listen as the screen lights up

[Bridge]
Every time that hotline bling
You just need some time to think, yeah
Don't care what your friends think
Them bitches want that diamond ring
But ever since you met them bitches
You knew you, you're a new you
Forgot to tell you I fucked them bitches 'fore I knew you
I guess they forgot too

[Verse 3]
You shouldn't call me from your girl's phone
Cause she ain't gonna delete my number
Press me when she know that you're gone
That bitch is gonna hit me right up
And do I still have my own private ring?
Oh, now you keep your shit on silent ring
Damn, why you think I let you keep your diamond ring?
To remind you of when I was king

[Outro]
I used to call you from the jail phone
And you would press one and receive my love
Used to call her from a jail phone
Phone sex 'til it beeps, time’s up
Girl, talkin' 'bout you thinkin' 'bout some ass shots
Taking beaucoup snapshots, different backdrops
I still fuck that pussy 'til you blackout
Take your tap out, no ceilings

[Verse 1]
Your man on the low talkin' to po-po
I just poured a 4, I'm moving slow-mo
You just tryna get me out my Polo
The sex look even better on the Go-Pro
I already know you go commando
You ridin' me, my Magnum is your saddle
Find out I was cummin' and you swallow
And let me stick my thumb up in your asshole

[Hook]
We still get them chickens for the low low
Pistols got us slippin' like we old folks
I know all my bitches is some homos
All my young niggas got them old souls
We some young niggas with some old money
You that one nigga, let me hold somethin'
And we got that white girl if your nose runnin'
In the middle of the summer sellin' snow bunnies

[Verse 2]
I already know you go commando
Me and all my goons up in the bando
I just popped two pills before I saw you
You gon' have to drive my fuckin' Lambo
Xannies always send me off to dreamland
Head startin' to feelin' like a bean bag
I'm goin' through some bullshit at the moment
But all them mothafuckas know I'll be back

[Hook 2]
Pray so much a nigga need some kneepads
Sip so much a nigga need to relax
How the fuck they expect me to relax?
I got crocodile tears under this ski mask
I get so lit, I done forgot what I came to forget
I am a dog, not ashamed to admit
I'm finna pop me a pain pill and sip
I'm finna eat me a mushroom and trip
I'm finna pop with the AK and dip
I am just not feeling Nae Nae and Whip
I'm finna pop me a pain pill and sip

[Bridge]
And the pills have eyes, the pills have eyes
And they peek-a-boo at us
They seein' through, through us
It's like pills have eyes, the pills have lives
And they livin' through, through us
Livin' through

[Hook]
I was poured up and poppin' Xans last night
I just pulled up to blow some bands, fast life
I'm so fucked up and now you fuck with me
When you feel me
When I'm cupped up, that's the real me
When I'm cupped up, that's the real me, yeah
She wasn't fuckin' with your ass last night
I was all up in that bitch ass last night
I did my thing and now she fuck with me
And she feel me
When I'm turnt up, that's the real me
When I'm turnt up, that's the real me, yeah

[Outro]
Me and all my goons in the bando
Listenin' to some old school Jay and Jaz-O
Just got new cocaine before I saw you
You gon' have to take a fuckin' sample
Listenin' to some old school Jay and Jaz-O
And we still get the cocaine from Fernando
Prescriptions got me feelin' beaucoup shallow
I ain't got no ceilings in my castle
No Ceilings!

[Intro]
No Ceilings

[Verse 1]
Hey now, you're an all-star
But the bitches you be with, they are sub-par
But the bitches you be with, they be cock-blockin'
Hope you put the kids to sleep, baby cock-blockin'
You could really get this meat, get this hot sausage
And I'm way too rich to beef, I just buy a body
And I really kick my feet up, and that's not karate
Yeah, I really kick my feet up, let a thot massage 'em, yeah

[Hook]
Where ya ass was at when I was with the Hot Boys?
Probably watchin' Baller Blockin', eatin' popcorn, yeah
Where ya ass was at? You was in the drought, boy
I was probably at the fight bringin' out Floyd

[Verse 2]
Said she love me 'cause I'm laid back, she outgoin'
Opposites attract, pockets fat, like Samoan
I just told my goons I got it, I just waved 'em off
I just told Tunechi, "I got it" and he said, "Of course"
Lose my mind, the only time I'd ever take a loss
I work too hard for taking off, rrt, I'm taking off
Really 'bout to see a billion, I'm in arm's reach
Sleep on a hammock in the middle of two palm trees
My neighbors can't sleep, all they hearin' is them cars screech
My bitch can't sleep, all she hearin' is them car keys
I'm just sipped out and I'm way too tired to talk, please
I'm just sipped out and I'm way too tired, I'm yawning
Yeah

[Hook]
Where ya ass was at when I was fifteen in a Porsche?
Where ya ass be at when we be poppin' all these corks?
Where ya ass be at? Know you're prolly with them dorks
I'm prolly with some bitches that be poppin' pills and snort

[Verse 3]
Diamonds in my mouth, no Swarovski
I'm hittin' notes with the pistol, ooh, I'm off-key
And the money coming godspeed
I'm movin' slow, Lisa Turtle, Lark Voorhies
Found the treasure chest, inside was a heartbeat
And Katrina had us hustlin' out a RV
We had to stash and still balled, Steve Harvey
We had to stash and still balled, Steve Harvey
And we set a nigga up like eHarmony
And your bitch plain, nigga, and your car cheap
And we leave your brain right there on your broad cheek
And we leave some stains right there on your offspring
And the purple rain right here in the soft drink
Yeah, the purple rain right here in the soft drink
And to fight the pain, nigga, like a horse tranq
And we don't complain, nigga, and we don't blink

[Bridge]
And he dumb as hell, and I swear his ass don't think
I think he run with 12 and I think his whole squad linked
I be so underwhelmed, 'cause I swear his whole style weak
I'm moving slow as hell but the money coming godspeed
I'm moving slow as hell but the money coming godspeed

[Verse 4]
I just told a pussy nigga, "Call your henchmen, nigga"
I just stole on a nigga mid-sentence, nigga
Fiend searching in a haystack for syringes, nigga
Dopeman, got 'em flipping like some ninjas, nigga
Got 'em tweaking, got 'em lurking, got 'em cringing, nigga
Ooh, that's them symptoms, nigga, I can't prevent 'em, nigga
Split a nigga head in two, that's split decision, nigga
Been to Hell and back, came back in mint condition, nigga
Feel like Heaven when them racks return to spender, nigga
Feel like Heaven's only lacking your attendance, nigga
Feel like stunting, drop the tops and not them windows, nigga
Toss out your demo, I ain't even like your intro, nigga
I just went Kimbo with this tempo, un momento, nigga
You know my MO, nigga, pit that A-M-M-O, nigga
Blat

[Outro]
I ask my ceilings, "Where ya ass was at?"
To all my Ceilings fans, I'm back
They pushed the album back, fuck

[Intro: Mannie Fresh & (Lil Wayne)]
No Ceilings 2
No Ceilings Dos
No Ceilings Bisexual, that means two
Freaky! Here we go
(Tunechi)

[Hook: Mannie Fresh]
Tunechi in the building
His house ain't got no ceiling
These hoes, they catchin' feelings
We 'bout to make a billion
Stop that bitch
Tune, Tune, Tune, Tune
Tune, Tune, Tune
Step up to the mic, nigga
Get that bitch right, nigga
Step up to the mic, nigga
Get that bitch right, nigga

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi
No Ceilings 2, No Ceilings 2
Next to Lil Tunechi you are so minuscule
So pitiful
Dope in the spoon
'Bout to go grizzly bear, no Winnie Pooh
Tunechi
Gun under table
Hand on the Bible
My homies homicidal
You dead on arrival
I'm tatted up, I'm tribal
And I'm duckin' trial
I used to throw my money away, now I recycle
Shout out to the Vice Lords, and to Disciples
That's that gang talk, you need subtitles
We sendin' Scud missiles
Your bitch in love with us
We simply mud sippers
More cane than a cripple
Look I am nobody, 'cause nobody's perfect
Abracadabra, I make a ho out a virgin
I treat her like a servant
Thanks for your service
I'm cold like sherbet
Got it sewed up like a surgeon
It's me and Mannie Fresh back together, bitch we mergin'
The jokes on them and we smirkin'
Man fuck them niggas, they hurtin'
She deep throat like a serpent
I stole out too many purses
Got too many bitches flirtin'
It's No Ceilings 2, curtains

[Hook: Mannie Fresh & (Lil Wayne)]
Tunechi in the building
(I'm in the building)
His house ain't got no ceiling
(Ain't got no ceiling)
These hoes, they catchin' feelings
(They catchin' feelings)
We 'bout to make a billion
Stop that bitch
Tune, Tune, Tune, Tune
Tune, Tune, Tune
Step up to the mic, nigga
Get that bitch right, nigga
Step up to the mic, nigga
Get that bitch right, nigga

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Mula, baby!

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
No ceilings

My ceiling drop, my ceiling drop

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ayy, my milly rock, my milly pop (Bop!)
Them niggas ain't hot, they petty wap
Sippin' Barney, smokin' Baby Bop
She's performing on the table top
Steph Curry, boy, I'll take the shot (Bop-bop)
Then I'll pull off and wave goodbye
I'm ready for the war, I'm not afraid to die
My niggas wild like Omega Psi
My bitches screamin' "Ooh-la-la"
I tell my demons "Kumbaya"
Them sticks go "Boo-ya-ka"
Make a nigga say "Uhh na-na-na-na-na"
I got money on my mental
Got them niggas in my rear view
I'm a dog, I'm a dog
Rottweilin' on these Shih tzu's
Drop dollars on your temple
Pop collars like a pistol
Drive back and forth for codeine
Put some mileage on the rental
Money talks like Jimmy Kimmel
Jimmy Fallon and Jay Leno
I'm straight N.O., the U-N-O
Fast life, so uptempo
Ooh-wee, Presidential
In the Backwood, eating Mentos
Smoke that loud like crescendos
Rep the Mob like De Niro
Fucking like a nympho
Save her info like a hero
Write your name on a bullet
She wrote my name on her dildo
Smoking on that kill though
Got me happier than Gilmo'
I'm in chill mode, I'm in pill mode
I just fucked your fucking ear hole

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
No ceilings, woah
No ceilings
Yeah, two
Yeah, two
Holler at them bitches, Lucci Lou

[Verse 2: Lucci Lou]
Give a fuck about you haters
More concerned with stacking paper
Smoking bog and sipping Lakers
Watch your girl 'cause I can take her
Drop the top, no ceilings
As I'm plottin' on millions
With my niggas in this bitch
They like "Fuck it Lucci, get 'em"
I'm from that East side of New Orleans
Polo T's and Jordans
Where niggas dream to push foreigns
And all the hoes want ballers
I got the cheapest price on pearly white
If you need it, nigga, just call us
Long as you talking them dollars
I got it, nigga, just holler
Still no job – bitch, I ain't hurtin'
Put a ho on the stroll and told her "Get to workin'"
She dropped a Xanny in his drink, the Rolly in her purse
Then brought it back to Daddy, man I swear this pimpin' work
I pop the clutch and hit the gas, I love the way it skrrt
She popped a bean and poppin' ass, can't keep it in her skirt
I beat it up, she eat it up, no feelings
It's Lucci Lou and Tunechi, nigga, no ceilings

[Verse 3: Turk]
No ceilings, bih, like an astronaut
Turk and Wayne back at it, nigga, we ain't gon' stop
Thuggin' nigga, it's thug life, 2Pac
My youngin with me, they stay strapped with two Glocks
I'm Molly turnt, but so uptown, throwing threes up like slime
Pussy nigga keep hating on me, keep hating, I ain't got time
Too busy chasing this paper, got money on my mind
Fuck you and your favors, know you seen my grind
I kicked the habit, never thought I could
That shit had me since fourteen
I was shooting up, nigga, on tour, fucking up my dreams
Fucking off my green, fucking off with these hoes
Could've died over a million times, I swear only God knows
Now I'm back nigga, like a hungry dog at the doorstep, let's eat
Tell you pussy niggas that slept on me
"Hope you bitches die in your sleep"
Free my brother BG
I'ma scream the shit til he hit the streets
Til my brother Ralo RIP, I got that nigga
That's YNT

[Outro: Turk]
No ceilings, yeah, nigga, nigga
No ceilings, yeah, fuck with me it be a killin'
Yeah, Young Turk, nigga
I'm Mister YNT, nigga

[Intro]
No ceilings

Ballin' in this bitch, I put my partners on
Tie you up and make you call your baby mama's phone
Tell that bitch to bring that bag, oh lord we need that bag
Xannies in a plastic bag, call that a sleeping bag
On MLK in a Bugatti, I feel free at last
Percocets, Molly, and Syrup, I got PMS
Chillin' with your bitch watchin' First 48
And I still got that Act', you know I love the taste
And I let her hit the J
And I let her call me bae
And I let her call you back
Just to get that out the way
Then she hang up in your face
And I get it on her face
Then I teach her how to skate
Then I skate

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I'm standin' at a table full of choppas, nigga
I'm sippin' on the maple, Aunt Jemima, nigga
And trust me, nigga, you don't want no drama, nigga
Cause I swear we all nuts, John Bobbitt, nigga, woah
If you ain't got no skaters you ain't poppin', nigga
If you ain't got no skaters you ain't poppin', nigga
If you ain't got no skaters you ain't gnarly, nigga
Yeah you see us, we just skatin', you just fallin', nigga, woah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
She tryna put this money in her stocking
She kinda thick as fuck and got some knockers, woah
My niggas really Blood, and you just spotting whoa
We all over the bread like a Sloppy Joe
And when I'm in the pussy I'm a boss, knock her off
My enemy don't cross the line I draw, respect my art
Man I swear to God, these pussies soft like a moth
Weezy baby, diaper off, different cloth, different thoughts
Sippin' syrup like it's broth, life is short
Tart, fuck his bitch, whip his kids, drive his car
I'm grindin', tryna stack a hundred commas
Just popped a combo, I ain't talkin' bout McDonald's, woah

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I'm standin' at a table full of choppas
I'm standin' in the Maybach cause it's topless
I'm standin' at a table full of options
Different bitches, different flavors, different toppings
And we ain't got no traitors in our posse
And really I'm just wavy and I'm saucy
And really I'm amazing and I'm awesome
My whole squad lit, nigga, arson
If you ain't got no skaters you ain't gnarly nigga
If you ain't been to Vegas, you ain't party nigga
Shout out to Lil Capito and Marley nigga
I've been fuckin' with them since Atari, nigga
And me, I'm a lil 504 New Orleans nigga
I be in 305 though like a Marlin, nigga
And Hoody, he from Texas, bitches boppin', mane
And since I met him, I ain't ran out of drank, whoa!

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
When we leave H-Town, it's in a fish tank
Glass house Chevrolet, you can see everything
Bad bitches with cocaine nose rings
Give it up to real niggas and expose lames
Cold game, got me in the Mulsanne
Killin' these streets, audio drug slang
If you don't collect Ferraris, you ain't poppin', nigga
You could learn Italian in my driveway, bitches
If it ain't OG, I ain't coppin'
Don't smoke, we just throw it in the garbage
Them niggas ain't tough, they just talkin'
Outchea after dark, them niggas targets
Horror movie writer, I be with the monsters
Trill surround us, you might not make it out 'em
Phone calls in the morning, say they found him
Whole hood wanna see what y'all gon' do about it
Rolled up on the front porch at my grandma's house
Watchin' Blood Sport through the screen door
What you know about gunshots? Ever seen war?
I've really seen more than I talk 'bout, nigga
Stuntin' on streets you're scared to drive down
Our town, children be firin' live rounds
Hug the ground 'cause the shit gettin' serious
Fuck around, get killed unintentional
While I'm outchea eatin', nigga, Whole Foods
Rollin' up straight gas, fresh produce
I'm the guy that you go to, criminal smooth
Digital moves, triple the loot
Hopped on the phone, called the lot, "Gimme the coupe"
I thought of Tune, called back, told him, "Give me two"
That's what I do
If you ain't got no Daytons, you ain't poppin', nigga
One time for my low-riders hoppin', nigga

[Outro: Curren$y]
Yeah, eah, eah
Nah, nah nah, nah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Future]
That girl got you too too excited
That money had you too too excited
Them cars had you way out your character
That jewelry got you way out your character
Them girls got you way out your character
This fame got you way out of character
This flow got you way out of character
I showed you love now you way out of character

[Hook: Future]
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I should've known you would cross me
Because I'm on and I'm saucy
And now I'm gone and you salty
Steam coming from your head like a coffee
My reality is better than your dreams nigga
My ho pussy hole is wetter than your dreams nigga
My ho legs spread wider than your wings nigga
Put your head in a microwave, DING! nigga
You out of character, slime, you out of character
And me I'm out of patience, sick and tired like Malaria
These hoes like mosquitoes
These niggas trying to be hoes
What happened to that boy and I ain't Pusha T though
Supa where the cup at
I'm working on my comeback
The girl I'm with got much class
But she got a dumb ass
I keep a money bag, a drug bag, and a gun bag
These niggas ain't even shining, making the sun mad
Rappers in my lunch bag
Me and Future have a food fight
Bedroom full of new dykes
Old green and new white
That's old money, that's new coke
That's Young Money, that's 24/7, 3-6-5
That's Cash Money; I'm like "Who ho" Who ho, who ho!?

[Hook: Future (Lil Wayne)]
I should've known you would cross me (Yea who ho?)
I should've known you would cross me (I tell 'em kudos)
I should've known you would cross me (I tell 'em adios)
I should've known you would cross me (I'm on my patio)
I should've known you would cross me
(Thinking about Hollygrove)
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me (I tell 'em adios)
I should've known you would cross me (Yeah)
I was looking in your eyes you ain't built like that
(You ain't built like that)
You ain't built like that (I should've know)
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
They say I ain't a rapper I'm a trapper
I be with the robbers and the killers and the kidnappers
I'll fuck your bitch in your crib, watch the kids after
Still fuck a bitch, fuck the ring, motherfuck a pastor
I don't, I should've known she ain't really love me
I should've know she just want to fuck me
I fucked up, don't judge me
I got this money and I ain't turning down
This money'll turn your life up but bring your family down
Some of the closest niggas to me, they don't come around
Cause some of the closest niggas to me, I'll gun 'em down
For real
I should've known you'd cross me
I'm from the hood, that's where they taught me
Go hard until they off me

[Hook: Future]
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I got some niggas that was there
That ain't no longer there
I don't care
I don't cry about it
And I barely get sleep anyway
I should've known you would cross me

[Intro]
No Ceilings

[Chorus 1]
I walk in, I walk in, I walk in with goons
I'm parkin' Ferrari, I started like "vroom"
I'm staggerin', I'm flaggin', I'm actin' a fool
Pour up, yeah
I'm sipped out, I'm knocked out in my house all day
I pull up, I pull up, I pull up, like "ayy"
I pull up, I pull up and I fade away
That's NBA, yeah

[Verse 1]
Uh, I used to have braids but I still got the hoes, yeah
I loosen my brakes and I still got control, err
I remember the day that I got the Azure, mm
Back when them hoes was wearing Juicy Couture, yeah
Back when niggas was still wearing Velour, eh
When shit got out of hand, my hands was full, I'm
Going through some shit, yeah, but you know I ain't broke up
Just talked to Ms. Cita, she told me, "Stay focused"
I said, "Alrighty then," gotta make up my mind again
Fuck the bullshit, the fake and the counterfeit
Gotta shake it like Iverson, gotta take out my pocket lint
And make something out of it, like a scientist
Be creative and confident; no vacation, just power trips
Limo tint, limo tint 5 percent, Louie V moccasins
Treat her cat like a lioness, I’m on my Mufasa shit
Yeah, I'm saucy like pasta, bitch, I'm talking all kinda shit
Yeah, and I got that Flakka dick, them bitches be out of it
And I be OT with my bro T and Lil Hoody and Skateboard E
And that's my niggas, we fly niggas
With shotguns under both wings
We going up, pouring up
These niggas be ho-ing up
Ain't no peace, we chop off both fingers
I got that dope dick, your bitch is a dope fiend
I got the tattoos, all I need is the nose ring
Pour party at my place, more codeine than chlorine
Spraying at your head like some fucking Afro Sheen

[Chorus 2]
And I'm a Martian, I'm marching on the stars and moon
I come through in something without a roof
Staggerin', I'm flaggin', I'm reppin' Suwu
Yeah, Blood Gang
Look, I hop out, they watch how I hop out the Wraith
I spend it, I spend it, make it back next day
I pull up, I pull up, and I fade away
That's NBA, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I’m my mama’s son
And when I started thuggin', I was young
When I started cussin', I was one
Mama put that soap on my tongue

[Outro]
And when I started hustlin', I was twelve
And then I started pumpin' like the Shell
And when I started fuckin', I was young
And when I started cuppin', I was sprung
And then I started druggin', it was fun
Fuckin' with that honey, I got stung
And when I go out clubbin', I be numb
Started out from nothin', just some crumbs
Started up from nothin', just some crumbs
And now I got a bakery, yum, yum
And now I see the fakery, now I see the snakery
All I got is two words: blum, blum
No Ceilings

[Verse 1: HoodyBaby]
You at home broke as fuck doing the milly rock
I'm in Hollywood with millions, check my Diddy bop
Sipping Actavis, I put that on my double cup
Pushing work, man, we got the whole city hot
Raised up on Jeezy, Jay'd up on Yeezys
Young Money millionaires, me, T and Weezy
Sixteen in the peezy
Another sixteen, that's a PT
36 that's a keyzee
Push button start, bitches thought I lost my keys, please
Trappin' out my haunted house of ghosts, there's some scares there
And I got that work, homie yeah, yeah
Finessing all these niggas, I need air fare
All these diamonds dancing on me, baby very
I might call them Michael Jordans, I need every pair
Tell your homie hit my line, I got fishscale

[Verse 2: T@]
Certified hustler, yeah, real street nigga
It took me 31 years to make my first million
But I ain't trippin', this the beginnin'
Lost deposits at Chase, no time for chasing women
All black Porsche slammed on them red mags
I peel her top back and watch the haters get mad
They need to stop it, niggas don't like when you
Balling on them bitches, they just mad ‘cause they ain't got shit
And niggas with the gossip, ol' Dr. Phil ass nigga
You might as well go 'head on and start a talk show
Me and Hoody making big moves off in this Tahoe
Your bitch travel hundred feet, work off in that rental
Backstabber smile in my face, showing the dentals
But you know me, I chunk the deuces at them bitches
Never stop the chat, I keep it moving on them bitches
In and out of town and yeah I do it for my city
East side New Orleans is where a nigga get it
So have your money right or else I ain't fucking with ya
And I ain't posing twice so I hope you got the picture
Ya dig?

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Reporting live from the mother ship
And I ain't talking nothin' but Young Money shit
Yeah, I ain't talking no more Cash Money shit
Yeah, I ain't talking no more, now I'm coming, bitch
Distorting guys with the cutter
I'll rob a motherfucker talking all that big money shit
Got me hustling like I never had shit
I'm restarting from the bottom, now ain't that a bitch
But watch me turn this pit into a Brad Pitt
Yeah, watch me turn this world into a hand print
The money made me hungry like I'm fastin'
I see the stars lining up, I feel like NASA
I seen my homies give up on me like a marriage
I went back and counted up and no more stunting like my daddy, ah
Then my bitches hit me up and said she love me like a daddy, ah
Cuban bitch walking 'round my house like she live there
Wake up in her mouth, she dribble like Sebastian Telfair
I see y'all ain't playin' fair, I see you, you layin' there
You see bitches everywhere, you might see them in Vanity Fair
My homie got that Danity Kane
Them shots like planes they landing here
Oh yeah, and we got them bitches on that wifi
It's a bird, it's a plane, them bitches sky high
Back up off me motherfucker, whoa yeah yeah
Me, T and Hoody feel like Dame, Hov and Ty-Ty
Me, Mack and Po feel like Lyor, Hov and Tata
My bitch don't own panty hoes nor a bra top
Roll up the windows in the Rolls, nigga hotbox
Cut on some Drizzy in this bitch, we don't cha cha
Whole time I was ready, ain't no cat and mouse in my fetti
Ain't no Thomas, ain't no Jerry
Ain't it really ain't no thang, you niggas really don't gang bang
I'm with that mob smoking gas, ain't no limit on my tank
Up, up, up and away, cup, cup, cuppin' all day
We sipping that oil, we sipping that oil, more oil than Oil of Olay
You killas don't play, kill 'em on sight in the middle of the day
Shoot a nigga right in the middle of his face
Bullet be biting like a venomous snake
Pussy be tighter than traffic, LA
We got that white, we traffic all day
I went from Kool Aid and PBJ
Now it's champagne and caviar steak
But still reporting live from the gutter, bitch
Before I fade away I hit 'em with the stutter step
Yeah, now before I fade away I gotta stutter step
Before I fade away I hit 'em with the stutter step
I hustle like it's nothin', left my woman in her underwear
My youngin don't wear underwear, I love my -
Yeah I love my baby mothers, yeah, little hoody ain't no huggy bear
I represent that grizzly bear, my neck look like a city fair
Page out the Jungle Book, amazed is how your woman looks
When she see me and all my niggas coming
Afraid is how your gunners look, we take a finger, tongue or foot
And mail it to your people, we mean business, get that understood
Big ol' bag of fuckin' good, a little bad, a ton of good
I'm pretty like Blair Underwood, she insecure, my gun secured okay
I'm pretty like Blair Underwood, she insecure, my gun secured okay
No ceilings

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
All of my niggas is real, all of my niggas is solid
All of my money is in rubber bands, I do not carry a wallet
All of my bitches stay ready, soon as I walk in she gon pop it
Everyday I be floating, forever on autopilot
If that nigga ain’t got my money though
Wrap him up like a mummy though
Regular wolves howl at the moon
My wolves come out when it’s sunny though
My niggas ain’t got no words with police
You tell the cops what they wanna know
This shit right here is my dummy flow
No Ibaka but I bring that thunder though
Your girl a jumpoff, I holler "Geronimo"
Slam in that pussy like dominos
That boy Millz he got beats and all kinds of flows
What you think Weezy signed me for?
Stayed down and I’m still down
True definition of loyal

From birth to now, heart Big like L, Notorious, and Pun
I want what I deserve, and some

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
We kick down the door, said it before
We did not come round to play games with you niggas
They say you nobody til somebody kills ya

No game in this killer, murder he wrote
Can get life behind bars with these murderous quotes
The flow is like meth, it’s like crack, it’s like heroin
Yes I am spitting this dope
I am the future, I’m seeing right through you
I’m so New Orleans but I do not know voodoo
My piece will come face-to-face with you like Oovoo
Have niggas searching for you like it’s Google, I’m brutal
I’ve been slept on for a long time
Been patient for a minute, now I want mine
I hear a lot of niggas talking down
I’ma put my mothafuckin foot where the sun don’t shine
Can’t rhyme in a cypher like this
I’ve been rockin with the best
They don’t put me on the list
I’m an underground king
Underrated in the streets favorite
Every street corner gonna speak bout this
Rest in peace Pimp C
Still got the muddy cup full of Morgan Freeman
Yep, lean on me
Like Wu Tang, cash rules everything around me
You know I got the cream on me
Gun barrel smoking like hydro
Middle fingers up, fuck five-o
Still repping B's like a H-town nigga
When I’m finished in this bitch call Geico
You looking at a god man, I put that on the Bible
Killin’ everything fuck rivals
Hundred round drum on the stick
When I let the bitch off man it sound like pyro

[Hook: Shanell]

[Intro]
(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)

[Verse 1]
Fuck with me wrong and get hit up
We hit every block and we hit all your men up
She do every squat and she do every sit up
She dance everyday and she pick every bit up
I work everyday and I sip when I get up
You heard what I say, yeah I sip when I get up
And work everyday, I'm a hell of a nigga
Smokin' that loud, it just yell at a nigga
Confidence high, I'm a arrogant nigga
These bitches do not want a regular nigga
My slime got them bricks doing estimates, nigga
That's numbers and squares like a calendar, nigga
That's numbers and squares like a calendar, nigga
None of you squares wanna battle lil nigga
Cause shots come from nowhere like, Bop!
Abracadabra, nigga
Hold up

[Verse 2]
I fuck a clit up on everything
I put some sip up in everything
You hit your bitch up, she never came
She was with me up in Neverland
I hit your clique up and everything
I take two clips up in everything
I'm coming, I'm shooting up everything
I just bought my woman some Vera Wang
I just bought myself Alexander Wang
I just bought myself some new Louis frames
I got 'em prescribed cause I'm blind as fuck
Or is it that I just don't wanna see you again?
Got 'em prescribed
I got a prescription
I got a prescription
I got a prescription...
I fuck a clit up on everything
Tie my bitch up to the bed frame
22.5 for the Venus
11 flat for the Serena
Drink codeine like it's Aquafina
My bitch jalapena
I come from Mars, I come from Ms. Cita
Fresh out the womb I knew I was a leader
Who keeping score 'cause I beat 'em

[Hook 1]
And I got some really big wings
Flying over New Orleans
I pull some really big strings
My wingspan like Yao Ming
My eyes tight like Yao Ming
I smoke some really big greens
I sip the whole sixteen
I saw a mill' at fifteen
And still got really big dreams
Your bitch a really big fiend
Your bitch a really big fan
But I ain't got no ceilings
I ain't got no ceilings
I ain't got no ceilings
I ain't got no ceilings

[Verse 3]
Man, what a high
Born to be alive
I'm sippin' lean
And TMZ said I died (damn)
I run with bitch-slappers
Your hate don't impact us
Our bitches' dick-grabbers
Your bitches' pic-snappers
You just a camera rapper
But we don't point cameras at you
We point them hammers at you
More bullets than hammer dancers
We take the pineapple
And we fill it with purple, we never settle
We take the Mac-11
We point that bitch straight at your cerebellum
Bah!
Yeah, and this world is mines
Yeah, I'm gettin' mines
Yeah, I'm sippin' lines
Sippin', oh we talkin' lean?
Oh, we talkin' lean?!
Oh, you pourin' up?
Finna fall asleep?!

[Verse 4]
Look at the smile on me
Spent a couple hundred thou' on it
And the game been drove me crazy
Over hundred thousand miles on me
Damn, said she gonna lie for me
I said you just lied to me
She tell me that's my pussy
I say bitch you just lied to me
That's why I fuck 'em all
Still love 'em all
With a rubber off
Cause they husbands' dogs
And to top it off
All the tops is off
And it's winter season
But the seats is heated

[Hook 2]
And I got some really big wings
I got a really big regime
Been part of some really big schemes
I just popped a really big bean
I just popped a really big bean
I rock some really big bling
I sleep on a really big king
With a really thick queen
I sleep with a really thick queen
On a really big king
She belt out really big screams
She say I got a really big ting
She say I'm doing really big things
I should be doing really big scenes
On a really big screen
You see, I got really big dreams
And what a grind...
I fuck a clit up on everything
I put some sip up in everything
I put some sip up in everything
I put some sip up in everything
No Ceilings

[Euro & Lil Wayne]
I think I’m seeing things
When I don’t see a thing
I woke up and realized
All the nightmares that dreaming brings
Let my people go
I know y’all hear 'em screaming things
Now load up choppers
Point it at the coppers
Let-let freedom ring

I like the sweeter things
So what bitch, no needle strings
I wake up, stretch my feet and wings
My life has no deleted scenes
I pop-pop-pop and leave the scene
Leave the scene Noxzema clean
Sippin on that lean cuisine
Incredible Hulk on creatine
My nigga
Fuck the world
And may I mention, fuck the world again
But I wanna go around the world
Tune, you down to go around the world again?

I am
And you can trust in a nigga like fam
I’m hitting these licks with my niggas like stamps
Giving these hoes headaches like rams
Yes ma’am
And I

I just might call your girl a friend
But fuck her like she my girlfriend
Talk to her like she my girl
Like, oops you look like my girl’s twin
I sin, I'm bad, I meant "My bad"
I’m lost in future, present, past
All those drinks I had
I speed, I'm fast, I blink, I crash
They say it’s my time
I’m racing time, I think I’m last
And if Tune mentions lean again
Then I might drink his stash
The underdogs understand what I lay over tracks
New school, but all I listen to is older raps
Bitch I still
I still been drinking on the low
I never think because I know
And pimpin haven't died and money getting old
And now the wrinkles starting to show
My rims twinkle like a toe
I’m tippy toeing wit' your ho
One thing led to another, and then the pencil broke
I got that; handgun on the table, shotgun in the closet
Police in disguises, I don’t like surprises
I don’t like tomatoes, I don’t like tamales
Shoutout to my plugs, I pray the rats don’t chew the wires
Straight ballin, you niggas just bald spots
When they tried to read my palms the pages were torn out
And you pussy niggas get hauled off
No cough drops

I’m tryna make the same cash off rap they made off pop
I’m off topic
I killed more than I did with a gun with a skill
I’m no role model
I’m rollin' with models, rollin' off pills
I’m rollin' over
Whoever's not rollin' with us, then road kill
Tryna get Uncle Phil cake
In case I die tryin' I wrote Wills
I’m chillin', for the moment
'Til I can’t figure out the code
To get the motherfucking safe open
Who the fuck left the cage open
Stage of rage
I’m liable to blow your fucking face open
Every bone you could break, broken
If I go broke, every home I could break in, broke in
Pussy look like a steak smokin'
Niggas slippin' like the lake frozen
And I hate rodents
And I stay chokin'
Off the straight potent
'Til it make no sense
Niggas talking shit
Nigga I can get you wacked
Nigga you can picture that
'Til you break your lens
Nigga take your ends
Nigga fuck your ho
While you cutting your grass
Nigga cut your throat
Taking out your trash
Pull up on you slow
Going nowhere fast
When you got nowhere to go
Nigga hung 'em by a rope
Dump 'em by the boats
Fuck 'em, adios
Fuck 'em, I don't care
Got a bad bitch naked
And she just asked
“What you gonna do to me that I ain't done to myself?”
I say “Ooh talk dirty, but don’t talk long"
You leave Wayne’s world it’s a long walk home
My pockets on that growth hormone
I call them shots, can I get a dialtone
Yeah

Mula, can I get a million
'Til the heads or tails
'Til I get a full coin
Full fledge, full house
When your friend gon' join?
Got a friend in the cut with a gun by the groin

And what are friends for
I’m still the boss, don’t get sent for

Roger that, 10-4
Nigga send me, point 'em out
Where he at, I got 'em
We don't wanna see you back in court

The weed so loud bitches get ignored
Cause I ain't got time to go back and forth
I told that bitch don't question me
Bitch, if you do you asking for it
I’m spaced out like asteroids

Feeling like A-rod after ‘roids
I'm from Prov city

And I’m from New Orleans
The part that’s destroyed

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
If young Freeway don't trust you, I'm gon' murk ya

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I told my homie I'll be back, I got some hoes that tryna see me

Sometimes a nigga just cry for no reason

Now I'm so rich this shit feel like I'm dreamin'

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
You pussies can die for no reason

That bitch is nasty for real, she naked in heels
Fuck Tom, Dick, and Harry and Bill
Sonya, Sarah and Jill, I carry the steel
In anyone area still
‘Cause shit could get scary for real, I'm aware and I'm skilled
I had to bury some mills somewhere in a field
Please don't ask me where, my lips sealed
Very concealed, I got whatever you feel
I got blow like Derek Foreal
I got that white like Jaleel
I'm 'bout that life and that's real
I'm 'bout that life and that's real
I say that twice ‘cause that's real
Sometimes it's like I just feel like ain't nothing easy
I'ma get high for that reason
And you could still die for no reason, die for no reason
I just be fightin' my demons

'Round here you can die for your Visa

'Round here we don't die for no divas
And I just be high for no reason

They kill my pop at fourteen
Sometimes a nigga just cry for no reason
'Round here you can die with your homie
'Round here you can die by your lonely
We come on your side for no reason
Shoot it up and then smile when we leavin'

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
You could still die for no reason
I be getting high for no reason
The world it be tryna get over

I ain't got no ceilings
I ain't got no feelings
And you all in your feelings
I'm like, "Fuck your feelings"
You know I ain't got no ceilings

[Intro]
No Ceilings
All my niggas clutchin'
All my niggas two-cuppin'
All my niggas rap and trap

Real one since day one
And all my niggas could vouch for me
None of my niggas lack in math
And all my niggas countin' money
Yeah

[Verse]
Pull up, banger on me
Bad bitch fainted on me

Don't wake me up, just put a blanket on me
Thank ya, homie, but I ain't ya homie
Diamonds blingin' like they blinkin' on me
All about the Ben Franklins, homie
Bitch can't even get an Abe Lincoln from me
Thinkin' normally, I ain't thinkin' normally
From New Orleans, guns bang in harmony
These little niggas is retarded
Puttin' testimony over sanctimony
All these niggas tryna sink the homie
Bitches tryna put the gangster on me
Feds tryna put sanctions on me
The doctor tryna do maintenance on me
Guess that's why I take  meds on 'em
Pop and sip and go to bed on 'em
New Ferrari, no head on it
Nice new carpet, you bled on it
These new artists no competition
Top of the charts no top of the menu
That ain't art, nigga drop the pencil
She drop the drawers, I never drop the pistol
But I drop the clip
And pull out a new clip
I'm not 'bout that lip
Bop-bop, nobody exempt
And you see the flaaag, as red as a bitch

My slimes say I'm brazy, I used to talk to a globe
I tell it it's mine, I tell it "One day you be mine"
I tell the front page "You be mine"
I was locked up upstate for that iron
You know I'm comin' straight off the top
She knew I cum on her halter top
Cause she know I don't want no five children
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot
Bitch, is you dykin' or not?
These niggas is wifin' the thots

Look at the watch on my friend
Say hello to my lil friend

Bop-bop; that bitch just had twins
Lord, you run your mouth like a marathon
I just run out of them styrofoams
The Cialis give me testosterone
Now she got her legs on my collarbone
All on my neck like a herringbone
I had to sit down with Bizzy Bone
I had to sit down with Tity Boi
And told him just how I'mma kill his song
It's not a remix
It's just me, on my comeback and shit
I just unwrapped a brick
Put it on the scale, it come back thirty-six
It come back thirty-six
Then that's when we whip, we mastered the wrist
Then that's when it flip
Then after it flip, that's when it flip
You know what it's like when the feeling gone
I know what that's like when the ceiling gone
I know what that's like when the ceiling gone
I know what that's like when the ceiling gone
Watch out lil bitch
My partner got hitched

We just Netflix and chillin' up in your apartment
You got on them shorts that you got from your college, alright
But I'm so focused right now
You know just what I'm tryna do
We was watchin' a movie
But now that bitch watchin' me watchin' you
Tell your roommate to stop being nosy
Cause me and you about to get cosy
You say you a freak, well, then show me
But I'm telling you girl, take it slowly

[Bridge: T-Pain]
Cause this ain't, this ain't what you used to, you used to

You said you a freak, girl, then show me
But I'm telling you girl, take it slowly

[Bridge: T-Pain]

[Outro: T-Pain]
Shawty, you gone let a nigga fuck or what?

[Verse 1]
Smoking on strong, money long, we don't reason
Probably with my niggas, but my bitch Polynesian
Met this bad little broad, she was curvy
Sipped out in the middle of the day, I started early
Balling in the middle of a drought, we ain't worried
Middle finger up to the judge and I'm smirking
Bring your squad cause you know my gang with me
Drop the top on the car, let the tits breathe
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds snatching
Michael Myers, Norman Bates, Charles Manson
Commas, commas, commas, commas, commas cashing
We fight time and time and time and time and time and time
Again

[Hook]
I told my plug "You know what I need
From you when I get on
Yeah, uh
Two bricks, a triple beam and a foam
So I can make a storm like I usually do"

[Verse 2]
Banging with my friends, nigga that's Soo-woo
Calicoe spit like a Uzi do
You'll be so hard to identify when you're
Hit up from your arms to your corns and still bleeding
All my niggas children of the corn like Stephen
King - I met this broad she was curvy
Bitch started twerking when them whips start urr-ing
Getting money since 'Got Money'
And if you real you could vouch for me
I still need my Block Is Hot money

Trampoline with the work, I got the block jumping

[Hook]
I told my plug "You know what I need

[Verse 3]
Bad bitch on my arm that's my new lil boo
Pussy be so warm and it's Juicy Fruit
Trampoline on this dick, I got her twat jumping
Trampoline with the work, I got the block jumping
Vaseline on a brick in case the cops coming
Trafficking with the work in her bra for me
Wearing lingerie and heels round the house for me
Wearing lingerie and heels round the house for me
All these bitches try'na chill then thaw out for me
Trampoline with the work, I got the block jumping
Got the block

[Outro]

I don't want no dealings with them niggas, no
Ungrateful

[Verse 1]
Oh, they say people come, say people go
This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone, and the world may not know
Still I see you, celestial

[Verse 2]
Like a lion you ran, a goddess you rolled
Like an eagle, you circled, in perfect purple
So how come things move on? How come cars don’t slow?
When it feels like the end of my world
When I should, but I can’t let you go

[Chorus 1]
But when I’m cold, cold
Yeah, when I’m cold, cold
There’s a light that you give me when I’m in shadow
There’s a feelin' within me, everglow

[Verse 3]
Like brothers in blood, sisters who ride
And we swore on that night, we’d be friends 'til we die
But the changin' of winds, and the way waters flow
Life is short as the fallin' of snow
And now I’m gonna miss you, I know

[Chorus 2]
But when I’m cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know that you’re with me and the way you will show
And you’re with me wherever I go
And you give me this feelin', this everglow

[Bridge]
Oh, what I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Yeah, I live for this feelin', this everglow

[Outro]
So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow

I look up in the sky and realize this is where I belong
And if I'm really here, then why do I feel so gone?

[Pre-Chorus]
But I ain't trippin', I ain't trippin', I ain't trippin', no

Don't need to look back to the past when I can see inside the future

[Pre-Chorus]
But I ain't trippin', I ain't trippin', I ain't trippin', no (I'm not trippin', baby, I ain't trippin')

Wassup with you? What you doin' tonight?
Said I hope it's me tonight, then I book you a flight
Oh, what a night, sleepover like it's junior high
We gettin' high, high ceilin's lookin' at your life
Rain, snow, or shine, she there every time
Hit you with that nonchalant "I'm fine," crazy sex drive
Left you feelin' right, middle of the night
Midnight, do ya like semi-pics? Triple X
Baby, know it's on sight, so

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tell me how to get there

Start a little slow, now pick up the pace (Pick up the pace)
Everything I told you I was gonna do (Gonna do)

Your body, I want it until the mornin'

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tell me how to get there
And already be undressed
Just tell me how to get there

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
It started with my phone
And then we got to, to the point where I can't even leave you alone

[Verse 3: Tyga]
It's crazy right?
Every day I shuffle, you my ace of spades
I try to keep you in the deck, but you never stay
No FaceTime, bae, she just want me face-to-face
Put you on lock, now you got keys to the place
I was really fuckin' with you, told myself not to get attached
There goes that and all them other girls I had, that's a wrap
I ain't mad, one of you was worth a million them
I'm a millionaire, never leave and can't believe it all

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Started with a text message
Ended up with sex, yes, it's true
I wanna be on you
Started with a text message
Ended up with sex, yes, it's true

Now I'm kissin' you, touchin' you, freakin' you over at your house

Stare into darkness, staring at doom
My heart, boom, b-boom, boom
Stare into darkness, admit defeat

Put my hands up to the sky, feel it inside
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
Put my hands up to the sky, feeling like (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If these walls could speak
I wouldn't have to make believe you're here
Holy angel, just start the fire that burns in me
I need a savior 'cause I'm scared of me

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I done been through Hell and back
I'm seein' demons everyday, callin' the kettle black
Perfectionists, if you're perfect, where your medal at?
My life was goin' downhill, I had to pedal back
These niggas always wanna talk about the lame shit
If I looked back on my life, I wouldn't change shit
Maybe a couple more cars so I can lane switch
If I put that mic on silence and never sang shit
This my life and that's your job, dawg
I'm too high, got me thinkin' did the clouds fall? Prolly not
Shit, just put me back up in the bleachers
Back when all a nigga had was a pair of sneakers
All this stress on my chest, I'm fuckin' having seizures
Nowadays, havin' fun is fuckin' illegal
Walkin' with your head down, that's not grown man shit
I'm takin' over the game until I own that bitch
Yeah, nigga, in my hood them choppers always bussin'
Niggas livin' day-to-day like tomorrow ain't nothin'
Fuck love, that shit get in the way now
She lovin' every nigga, ass up and face down
Addicted to the game, my youngin's use a .38, first 48
They gon' throw that shit away, bet they never catch a case
I'm gone, separate myself from all the lames
If I die and float away, you gon' feel my mama pain
Sittin' in my room, I'm reminiscin'
Shit, I ain't have a pot to piss in
Family whippin' crack up in the kitchen
All eyes on me, so pay attention
Got a problem with the D.A., should've stayed my ass in V.A
Thousand hours, some bull, pickin' trash up off the freeway
I'm the nigga that the kids lookin' up to
Straight As now, before they say, "Fuck school," ha
And I don't bite my tongue for no weak nigga
'Cause y'all never had to starve for a week, nigga
No clothes but .44 to a household
Stomach growlin' but I kept my fuckin' mouth closed

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Pusha T]
If these walls could speak
I wouldn't have to make believe you're here
Holy angel, just start the fire that burns in me (King Push)
I need a savior 'cause I'm scared of me (The V.A. story)

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Came in the game thinkin' music was the way out
To get us off the corners, hit records was the payout
Hard transitionin' from hustlin' 'til it's grey out
A decade with the devil, lemme show you how this play out
Started as a duo, didn't stay a duo
Things fall apart, Ricky Martin left Menudo
Was a team of us, everything was for the crew though
Never Rosé while my niggas sippin' Nuvo
So, so records bought more dope
Every record label dollar went to more coke
Ghetto rich but still scramblin' like we poor folks
We was all goin' left from what the Lord taught
The pressure, my pride wouldn't let up
The way they took my niggas had us thinkin' we was set up
All at once so the pain hardly let up
Now this bitch mumblin' 'round the house about she fed up
Yugh, when it rains, it pours, nigga
Dope boys expect the money, hungry whore, nigga
Woo, with my niggas and the feds
Do you think I give a fuck if Def Jam is in the red?
They'll undership your record while they pillow talk in bed
So I never try to talk them motherfuckers off the ledge
"Jump nigga," like Joe Clark said
If you ain't tryna win then you better off dead, gone

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If these walls could speak
I wouldn't have to make believe you're here
Holy angel, just start the fire that burns in me
I need a savior 'cause I'm scared of me

[Verse 1]
Don't let that pretty face fool ya
See that girl, she's hot like fire
Don't judge a book just off the cover
That girl right there, she'll blow your mind, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Behind closed doors, yeah, she's something like an animal
Behind closed doors, yeah, you know that girl is a professional

[Chorus]
When the lights on (Lights on), she be acting shy (She be acting shy, shy, shy, shy)
But in the darkness (Darkness), she comes alive (She comes alive-live-live-live)
She's a fan
But that's alright, she's a freak at night
But that's what I like, look in her eyes
It's no surprise, she's a freak at night (Freak)

[Post-Chorus]
Ah!
Ah!
Yeah!
She's a freak at night
Woah!
Ah!

She's a freak at night

[Verse 2]
She's such an innocent killer
She don't even mean no harm, oh, no
Feels like I'm on the set of Thriller (Thriller, Thriller)
When the evening starts to fold, woah-woah-woah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Behind closed doors, yeah, she's something like an animal
Behind closed doors, yeah, you know that girl is a professional

[Chorus]
So when the lights on (Lights on), she be acting shy (She be acting shy, shy, shy, shy)
But in the darkness (Darkness), she comes alive (She comes alive-live-live-live)
She's a fan
But that's alright, she's a freak at night
And that's what I like, look in her eyes
It's no surprise, she's a freak at night (Freak)

[Post-Chorus]
Ah!

Yeah!
She's a freak at night
Woah! Ha, look
Ah! Leggo
Yeah!
She's a freak at night

[Verse 3]
Okay, freak at night, that's what I like
Vampire to the pussy, I'ma take a bite
Never drive for the dick, she gon' take a flight
A trip to Paris overnight
Bangin' to the beat with our clothes off
Takin' shot after shot 'til we doze off
And I smoke about a pound of that loud shit
And she fuckin' with the white, blow her nose off
Yeah, you a fan, why not?
Bet you never seen a cool nigga this hot
I spend a hundred grand, nigga, look at this watch
And her panties on the fan 'cause I'm hittin' that spot
Okay, when I pull up, I pull out and put it in
And she gon' run that shit when I get it in
Two doors, got two floors in my Benz
I fuck fans, I fuck fans

[Chorus]
So when the lights on (Lights on), she be acting shy (She be acting shy, shy, shy, shy)
But in the darkness (Darkness), she comes alive (She comes alive-live-live-live)
She's a fan
But that's alright, she's a freak at night
But that's what I like, look in her eyes
It's no surprise, she's a freak at night (Freak)

[Post-Chorus]
Ah!
Ah!
Yeah!
Woah!
Ah!
Yeah!
She's a freak at night

[Verse 1]
Girl, I've been waitin' up all night, sippin' tryna get rid of this pain
Henny in my cup all night and it don't even matter if I take that
They can never take your mistakes back, even if I take every sip of this bottle
Ain't a damn thing can erase that, the shit you did way too hard to swallow

[Pre-Chorus]
I better take one to the head now (Oh)
'Fore they get back, I'ma take two to my bed now (Oh)
But you a memory, best believe I'ma lay ya down (Oh)
For all the bullshit that be goin' through my head now (Oh)

[Chorus]
It's fucked up how you played me
It's fucked up how you played me
It's fucked up how you played me
So you might as well just erase me
Go and erase me
She on but a nigga just can't keep on
So go and erase me
She on but a nigga just can't keep on
Go and erase me

[Verse 2]
Valet finna pull up, this girl couldn't be fuller
Now you up in that place, so the DJ ain't the only one 'bout to pull up
I need you to know this ain't all about you, this ain't all about you now
When I do my thing, women in my Range, I'ma need me a bounty count

[Pre-Chorus]
One to the head now
'Fore they get back, I'ma take two to my bed now
But with you a memory, best believe I'ma lay ya down, I'ma lay ya down, I'ma lay ya down
For all the shit going through my head now
For all the shit going through my head now

[Chorus]
It's fucked up how you played me
It's fucked up how you played me
It's fucked up how you played me
So you might as well just erase me
It's fucked up how you played me
It's fucked up how you played me
It's fucked up how you played me
So you might as well just erase me
Gon' and erase me
She on but a nigga just can't keep on
So go and erase me
She on but a nigga just can't keep on
Go and erase me

Ooh, oh
Hey, hey, hey
Oh

[Verse 1]
Yeah, sometimes, I was the one
Yeah, I was the one runnin' 'round, actin' wild
And sometimes, you was the one turnin' up with your girls
Only sometimes
Now my heart's stuck in the middle
All in the mirror
Made my mistakes, but I love my kid, oh
My wrongs, got a list a mile long

[Chorus]
Yeah, now you wish I was the one
Wish I was the one who couldn't sleep now
Wish I was the one who couldn't eat now
Wish I was the one who couldn't breathe without the other one
Now, ooh, you
I'm the one that's s'posed to be broken
Break me down and build me up
Wish that I could meet you halfway
But I don't have the heart
Ooh, ooh, don't have the heart
Oh, yeah, oh

[Verse 2]
You say you wanted love
Yeah, I gave you that and more
Yeah, but when it came to trust
We both fucked up
Talkin' 'bout, "I saw you with your side ho"
I was looking for someone to ride for
The ring and the promise I gave you was only a milestone
Now we both wakin' up lookin' for missed calls and dial tones
And I'm sick of dreamin' 'bout you (Woah)
Now you sick of seein' my daughter
Her eyes look like mine
Now I'm forced to pick sides

[Chorus]
Yeah, now you wish I was the one
Wish I was the one who couldn't sleep, babe (Oh)
Wish I was the one who couldn't eat, babe
Wish I was the one who couldn't breathe without the other one

Break me down and build me up (Woah)
Wish that I could meet you halfway
But I don't have the heart
Woah, no, woah, yeah
Don't have the heart
Oh, yeah, oh

[Bridge]
Girl, you was s'posed to have the first pick (Oh)
And I don't go to church like you wish I did (Oh)

Cryin' ain't easy
Trust me, baby, I need you to hold me
I miss my friend (My friend)
Netflix and chill at the crib
Mind, body and soul, you my rib (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Why you wish I was the one? (Oh-oh)
Wish I was the one who couldn't sleep
Wish I was the one who couldn't eat
Wish I was the one who couldn't breathe without the other one
Now, ooh, you, you
I'm the one that's s'posed to be broken
You the one to break me down and build me up (Woah)
Wish that I could meet you halfway
But I don't have the heart (Ooh)
I don't have the heart
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

I've written so many letters, tried to e-mail you, all I ask is why you dodgin' me?
And he's not any better, I could do you better than he can

[Pre-Chorus]
I see the way you are with me, I know that you ain't satisfied
But it's like you don't even remember

[Chorus]
It's like I don't even matter on your birthday, for the holidays
Got me goin' crazy, you're on my mind
It's like I don't even matter, your love is gone, girl, you're done with me
Do you think about us? I miss you so much, it's like I don't even matter

[Verse 2]
I miss the smell of your perfume, I lay by the fireplace
I guess tonight is the night I miss your touch
Baby, I need you, the only love I have in my heart is for you
Can't even live, can't even live with the pain I feel inside
This is real
Why you giving up? Can you see me? Am I invisible?

[Pre-Chorus]
I see the way you are with me I know that you ain't satisfied
But it's like you don't even remember

If I can't have you, I'ma break down (Ow!)

[Chorus]
It's like I don't even matter on your birthday, for the holidays
Got me going crazy, you're on my mind
It's like I don't even matter, your love is gone, girl, you're done with me
Do you think about us? I miss you so much, it's like I don't even matter

[Outro]
No, baby
No, baby
Let's go, baby
Go, baby
Oh, baby

[Verse 1]
Been a month or two, eight weeks for me exactly
Since we sat and talked for hours
Girl, it's just ain't right, when you give me the run around
I can't even give you flowers

[Pre-Chorus]
It's all in your head when your friends talk about me
You run away from the truth and accept the lies, you doubt me
I'm like a fool contemplatin', I'm just waitin' on your call
We couldn't last 'til the Winter and now it's Fall
We fell in love, I'm still fallin'

[Chorus]
Sometimes I let my thoughts run away from me
Don't know how many days in a year
Runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round 'til I catch up
Oh, yeah (Now, why?)
Now why the hell I let you get away from me? (Yeah)
Never thought that I would say goodbye to my girl, no, oh
Girl, you changed like the seasons

[Verse 2]
Girl, I've given my time and all my love
Not to mention, I didn't cheat but you didn't even trust me
Even when you out late night, messages on your phone, baby
I never said a word, I just left it alone

[Pre-Chorus]
It's all in your head when your friends talk about me
You run away from the truth and accept the lies, you doubt me
I'm like a fool contemplatin', I'm just waitin' on your call
We couldn't last through the Winter and now it's Fall
Girl, we fell in love, I'm still fallin'

[Chorus]
Sometimes I let my thoughts run away from me (Yeah)
Don't know how many days in a year
Runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round 'til I catch up (Gotta catch up)
Oh, yeah (Now, why?)
Now why the hell I let you get away from me? (Yeah)
Never thought that I would say goodbye to my girl, no, oh
Girl, you changed like the seasons

[Bridge]
No, woah, I'll never the see the brighter side
'Cause you're everything that I wanted
And I don't wanna see you go, woah, oh
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life without you here with me
I'll never let go, I need you

[Chorus]
Sometimes I let my thoughts run away from me
Don't know how many days in a year
Runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round 'til I catch up
Oh, yeah (Now, why?)
Now why the hell I let you get away from me? (Yeah)
Never thought that I would say goodbye to my girl, no, oh
Girl, you changed like the seasons

Baby, I ain't lookin' for love
And I gotta tell you, you the baddest thing I seen in this club
And I know you probably done been with every baller
But I'm still tryna see what's up with you, girl
And, baby, if you want us to be alone, yeah
We can go somewhere where nobody will hear you scream
You gon' be beggin' when I got your legs up
Sorry, girl, I fucked your head up
But you said put it on you and that's what I'm gon' do

[Chorus]
It never really mattered too much to me
'Cause tonight's the night for love
It never really mattered too much to me
I'm gonna lay you down, take you down
Just come let daddy kiss it, oh, girl
It never really mattered too much to me
Got you open, I'm in it, in it
Got you soakin', making your body
Girl, you wanna freak me, yeah, so go 'head and show off (Oh)
And you can take it off (Oh)
Lemme break you off
I know you 'bout to show off, yeah

[Verse 2]
Girl, my car's outside, wanna ride? Let's go
And I don't drive, I let my chauffeur do that or we can take my boat
And I'ma put a stack on it
I could take you places all them lame niggas can't go
As I’m going in and out of you
So now we drivin' down this back road, her hand on my thigh
She look me in the eyes and she started pullin' me close
I said I wanna get freaky, she said "yes" just as long as I don't go
I gotta stay 'til the mornin' and, baby, it never really mattered

[Chorus]
It never really mattered too much to me (Oh, oh, oh)
'Cause tonight's the night for love
It never really mattered too much to me (It never, never)
I'm gonna lay you down, take you down
Just come let daddy kiss it, oh, girl

Got you open, I'm in it, in it

Girl, you wanna freak me, yeah, so go 'head and show off (Oh)
And you can take it off (Oh)
Lemme break you off
I know you 'bout to show off, yeah

[Bridge]
This is for my ladies who got a man but they don’t let her wear what she want to the club
He be hatin', nigga, you better hope she don't meet me
'Cause I think she look better naked
And now she's in my presidential suite
Her body's on me, sick of bein' lonely
She make some new positions then she tries 'em on me
That's how I know she a freak, haha

[Outro]
That's how I know she a freak

[Verse: Chris Brown]
She my moon and my sun, you're my day and my night
She the smoke to my blunt, it ain't wrong, it ain't right
I don't wanna lose her, but I can't live without you
This shit is only gettin' worse and either way I'ma lose

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Responsibility versus reality, oh-woah
Instead of makin' you hate me, I have to make you love me
Never thought I'd be crucified for tryin' to be honest
I'm done with hidin', it is what is, no use in tryna pretend

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]
I can't win
What you sayin'? What you sayin'? Oh, no
I can't win
What you sayin'? What you sayin'? No, woah
What you sayin'? What you sayin'?
I ain't with the one I love 'cause I love the two I'm with
I ain't with the one I love 'cause my heart is literally split
And it drives me insane that every day is different
No conclusion

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Responsibility (Yeah, yeah) versus reality, oh-woah
Instead of makin' you hate me, I have to make you love me
Never thought I'd be crucified for tryin' to be honest
I'm done with hidin', it is what is, no use in tryna pretend

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]
I can't win
What you sayin'? What you sayin'?
Girl, I, I can't win
What you sayin'? What you sayin'? Ooh, baby

[Verse 1]
How did we get to my place?
After last night, I'm looking for steps to trace
All I know is we made love all over my place
And that's all I can remember, but my condo gave the play-by-play

[Pre-Chorus]
It started when I seen all of the bottles of Patrón
Empty, obvious that somethin' crazy here went on
Sex was everywhere, whipped cream all over the counter
But she's nowhere to be found
I took a look around, but the only thing I found was

[Chorus]
Lipstick on the glass (Oh)
'Cause we drank, got drunk, that night, we lived it up (Oh)
Yeah, that night we did it up
And now the only trace I found was lipstick on the glass (Oh)
Shot after shot, we got high, sippin', we tore it up (Oh)
Now all I got left is the lipstick on the glass

[Verse 2]
I can still smell your perfume in my home
I can still taste the sweetness of your touch
I should ask the neighbors, maybe they know
I know they heard us lovin' on the night before
I'm tryna find out where you are, hope you not very far
I gotta find you, girl, where we can have another night with all these

[Pre-Chorus]
Bottles of Patrón
Empty, obvious that somethin' crazy here went on
Sex was everywhere, whipped cream all over the counter
But she's nowhere to be found
I took a look around, that's when I saw that she left the

[Chorus]
Lipstick on the glass (Oh)
'Cause we drank, got drunk, that night, we lived it up (Oh)
Yeah, that night we lived up
And now the only trace I found was lipstick on the glass (Oh)
Shot after shot, we got high, sippin', we tore it up (Oh)
Now all I got left is the lipstick on the glass

[Bridge]
Left her lipstick on the glass (Oh)
She left her lipstick on the glass (Oh)
Saying this the best night she ever had (Oh)
Lipstick on my glass
Saying call her A.S.A.P., she'll be ready

[Chorus]
Lipstick on the glass (Oh)
'Cause we drank, got drunk, that night, we lived it up (Oh)
Yeah, that night we did it up
And now the only trace I found was lipstick on the glass (Oh)
Shot after shot, we got high, sippin', we tore it up (Oh)
Now all I got left is the lipstick on the glass

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Scattered thoughts, scattered brains
What you know about it, baby? What you know about it, baby?
Scattered thoughts, scattered brains
What you know about it, baby? What you know about it, baby?
I've been running 'round in circles
And I keep coming back to no one to find (Yeah)
And I've been dealing with these women
So confused, all these feelings, so I leave them behind
I've been tryna find different
But really what's the difference when they seem too alike? (Oh-woah)
Then she end up in my bed, something that I said
Then she thought she was mine (Yeah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Rihanna]
Are you still down, baby? Still down, baby?
Are you really 'bout that life? Are you really 'bout that life?
Are you still down, baby? Still down, baby?
Is you down for the ride? Is you down for the ride?
Here we go again, here we go again
Why can't you let it go? (Ooh)
'Cause I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna fight
Here we go again, here we go again
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Who could love you better?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I could love you better

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I've been tryna do better
But all of my habits got me changing my mind, changing my mind
One day, I wanna love ya
Next day, I'm feeling off, feels like I'm loving you blind, girl, I'm loving you blind
I wish my heart could be stable
But it's so damn unable
Guess I'm just not ready
Just not ready for you, woah, woah, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Rihanna]
Are you still down, baby? (Still down) Still down, baby? (Are you?)
Are you really 'bout that life? (Really) Are you really 'bout that life?

J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League

[Chorus]
Every time I go, they keep tellin' me "No" (Uh-uh)
And life's travelin' fast all around you, whispers about my past
I could tell you anything I want
But I'd rather rewrite my wrongs if I'm allowed to
So let me know if you can trust me (One time)
If you can trust me, then trust me
If you can trust me, baby, oh
If you can trust me (Oh, no), then trust me, yeah (Ha)

[Verse]
This your moment, baby, I'm just trying not to miss it
You just gotta keep it one hunnid with all your bitches
Tell 'em that you fuckin' with a thug who got a pistol
That sip codeine and made a quarter-million off of chickens
But you know every boy gotta man up
And what's the point of fuckin' if we can't love?
I want her, she's mine
I know I broke her heart now, now I understand her
I know that she wanna forgive, but I know better, she'll never forget it
All of the people that's all in her head, wish she could make up her mind with decisions
Already heard that she fucked with a player, told me she never would fuck with a player
Even when I was that nigga in jail, one visitation but never no mail

[Chorus]
Every time I go, they keep tellin' me "No" (Uh-uh)
And life's travelin' fast all around you, whispers about my past
I could tell you anything I want
But I'd rather rewrite my wrongs if I'm allowed to
So let me know if you can trust me (One time)
If you can trust me, then trust me
If you can trust me, baby, oh
If you can trust me (Oh, no), then trust me, yeah

Uh, I blow your back out, I get it right to the trophy

All of that ass can't even fit in the camera
Swallow me down, it's hard to swallow this hammer
You know the plan, baby, you're good with no hands (Woo, uh)
Swallow a rich nigga baby, just swallow these bands (Can't, can't, can't)
I make it rain, I make you swallow that rain
Swallow me down, there's room for two on this thing

Shawty was frontin', she swallow me now
Fresh out the trap, pimp like I'm Goldie
Obama the Rollie, live for the moment
I won't lease what I'm ownin', I ride like it's stolen
Roll up a Phantom, four in the Phantom
Came in the Phantom, sniper, no ghost
Loaf in the carol, Ceasar cabana (Hold up, hold up)
Left in the slammer, ride with the toast
Shawty gon' swallow, record a album
Shawty was frontin', now shawty gon' gobble
Came out the bottom, drink out the bottle
Can't afford love with the shit you get high with
I tell her she gon' be my bottom bitch
Flyin' problem, fuck a condom (Condom)
She wanna strip, took her to Vegas, she on a power trip
Makin' a livin' suckin' dick and modelin'
She givin' paper to me like the lottery
I'm feelin' way up, she hella fine with no make-up
Breakfast in bed, she be givin' me head when I wake up
Oh, she swallow (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
She swallow, haan

[Chorus: Chris Brown, French Montana & Both]
Swallow me down, you gotta swallow me down (Ooh)

[Verse 4: French Montana, Chris Brown & Both]
(What you been sippin' on?)
Say my name a lickle louder (Louder)
Got the cocaine and no power (Power, oh)
Pussy wet, fresh out the shower
Rolls came with a driver, shawty too fake to be honest (Oh)
All that bitch want is them commas, and all a nigga want is money and power (Drink, drink, drink, drink)
Hey, hey

[Outro: Chris Brown]
All these women I done made, tired of makin' bitches famous
Tired of givin' bitches names, fallin' in love can get dangerous
Please don't give your mind to nobody, fuck with that brain, I mean your body
Got a sickness, I got ho problems, gag reflex so she don't swallow

[Verse 1]
Filter out the pain
If you're gonna take my breath away
Black lungs (Black lungs), intoxicating
I'm addicted to your poison

[Pre-Chorus]
There it goes, I'm just fadin' as fast as she came
If I die, then you know who to blame
All because of you, you

[Chorus]
You give me second-hand love like second-hand smoke
I keep breathin' it in, that's just how it goes with you
I'm used to your poison
You give me second-hand love like second-hand smoke
I keep breathin' it in, that's just how it goes with you
You're killin' me slowly

[Verse 2]
Nicotine dreams, gas-lit lover
Temporary high, then I suffer, take my breath away (Away)
I think it's what I need, you took all of my nightmares out the safe
Girl, your menthol kisses, I made my peace with, now my breathing's different

[Pre-Chorus]
There it goes, I'm just fadin' as fast as she came
If I die, then you know who to blame
All because of you, you

[Chorus]
You give me (Me) second-hand love like second-hand smoke (Yeah)
I keep breathin' it in, that's just how it goes with you
I'm used to your poison
'Cause you give me second-hand love like second-hand smoke (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I keep breathin' it in, that's just how it goes with you
You're killin' me slowly (Yeah, uh)

[Bridge]
Carry me, girl (Ha), carry me (Yeah), carry me away
Like the smoke that—, like the smoke that you blew my way (Yeah)
How, how could you, babe? How could you, babe?
Put a filter on your love, aw, yeah
Carry me, girl, carry me, carry me away (Oh)
Like the smoke that—, like the smoke that you blew my way (Woah)

[Pre-Chorus]
There it goes, I'm just fadin' as fast as she came (Oh-woah)

You're killin' me slowly (Oh)

[Verse 1]
Shit is kinda crazy, how you work me, lady
Thought I wouldn't notice, I can see you changin'
When did all this happen? (Oh) All this extra foreplay?
How you gon' try to play me then go and try to kiss my face?

[Chorus]
I want you to know that it's over, get your shit right now (Right now)
Go, ho, I guess the good guys always play the fool
I want you to know that I'll be fine if you not my girl
Don't need you anymore, don't love you anymore
'Cause you're a cold desperado

[Verse 2]
No more lies and me feelin' like something's wrong
You got me, good one, baby
Why'd you break my heart?
Never thought you were this way before, huh, but now I know
But I ain't gonna run away
And little mama, you won't put me out 'cause I bought this house, so leave
If you so fly, be gone
If you the shit, here's some toilet paper
You did me a favor

[Chorus]
I want you to know that it's over, get your shit right now (Right now)
Go, ho, I guess the good guys always play the fool
I want you to know that I'll be fine if you not my girl
Don't need you anymore, don't love you anymore
'Cause you're a cold desperado

[Intro: DJ Drama]
To whom it may concern
How should we start this?
I guess it's long overdue that we speak
I mean who ever thought we'd be here?
It's fair to say you did
And I know we did
But the rest of them, they didn't believe
So many blessings, few sins here and there
What a motherfuckin' life we done lived
But yet, we still feel like we gotta show you niggas how it's done

[Hook]
Now tell me God, how can you love me after all this sex?
How can you love me after all these drugs?
How can I be the one to feel so blessed? Oh, thank you
Had to get that off my chest, oh, thank you

[Verse 1]
I just dropped a bag in the club off of nothin'
I just did it all for the love of the stuntin'
I was in the strip club, we was throwin' money
I was in the strip club, I was throwin' hundreds
I just got a phone call, said press five
If you wanna talk to 'em on the other side
Told them when we touched down on me, we gon' ride
Outchea we gon' have your name so alive
I just got a call from my girl, she trippin'
Talkin' that bullshit, I ain't tryna listen
Only thing I wanna hear 'bout is the money mission
I just heard another song 'bout a nigga wrist flickin'
That's what everybody say, nigga what you really gettin'?
One thing 'bout it, I don't owe no nigga
I'ma go hard, go soul, go realer
Shout out to the dope boys tryna get skrilla
I just want a hundred rings, Slick Ricky
I just want to reach a mil, two fifty
I just want to call the Lyft, come get me, yeah
To pull up and take off, my nigga 'cause we got to go
Roll up 'cause we got the smoke
Get high whenever we want
Specially when I'm feelin' down
I got my niggas around
Thank God  my niggas around
Thank God that liquor around
Dive in that liquor and drown
All of my niggas have pounds
Big homies the shit in the town
I get you hittin' the town
Never forgettin' the town

'Fore I was shit in your town
Hop out the whip when I get in your town
And I'm dickin' the prettiest hoes

Now tell me God, how can you love me after all this sex?
How can you love me after all these drugs?
How can I be the one to feel so blessed? Oh, thank you
Had to get that off my chest, oh, thank you

[Verse 2]
I just got some pussy man, she was doin' magic
Baby got the gushy splash, hate to be graphic
I just bought some kush and man, it was fantastic
On the red carpet, nigga floatin' like Aladdin
Money stretchin', flippin' like aerobics and gymnastics
Nigga more focused than some bifocal glasses
Told Bully, please don't hit them with the plastic
Niggas on my team with the dealing' and the trappin'
We just want the rings and the women with the fashion
This is just a dream, boy, it wasn’t supposed to happen
Now I'm like a king, like I had you all clappin'
My nigga Dave bling, got the gold and the platinum
I could switch it up 'cause a nigga got the rose gold
Niggas switchin' up on a nigga that's a no, no
Got the stick in this bitch jumpin' like pogo
Never turnin' back, that's like fuckin' with my old hoes
Money in the bag that's just a nigga roll though
Don't we do it all for the dough though?
Don't you wanna ball like a pro though?
Think about it all while I'm dolo
She sendin' videos and the photos
Bustin' wide in the wide body photo
I'm tryna tell niggas they should know though
Shit movin' too fast, need slow mo
I feel like when Hugh Hef was young
Mansion, a few heifers come
Boy, I lost count of the tally
Move from the hills to the valley
No type of stylist can style me
Fuck with my robe, crown on my head
It fuck with my soul, fucked with my head
Where do I go when we leave here?
I talked to God, this what I said

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
I've been prayin' for some better days
I've been drinkin' all this liquor too
Every nigga tryna make a wave
I be prayin' for my niggas too
I'm a satan in the Maserati
I've been waitin' like I'm in the lobby
I've been prayin' for the wife type
But Lord knows I've be catchin' bodies
I've been prayin', I'ma make it up
I've been sayin' I don't pray enough
Just came home with a straight mil
But I've been sayin' they don't pay enough
I've been prayin' only women
Lord forgive me, I'm a lost soul
I've been spendin' all my riches
Do it all for the bankroll

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I've been prayin' I'm forgivin'
Treat the main like a mistress
Locked in my own prison
Can't see my own vision
Tryna find me like
Like a nigga gon' miss a straight trip
You see my grandma used to tell me
"Boy say your prayers 'fore you lay"
Make sure
You see my grandma used to tell me
"Boy say your prayers 'fore you lay"
I be prayin', I be prayin', when I see the police now, when I see the police
I be prayin', I be prayin', that they never gun me down, that they never kill me
If I die before I wake
Lord I'm gon' be straight
Prayin' that I see another day
Thank God I done seen another day

[Verse 2: Chisanity]
2Pac nigga, prayin' for me, better days
Two shots for a nigga, seen him just the other day
Mama prayin' that she keep my life insurance paid
Pussy niggas, they hit you any time of day
I'm just livin', Lord forgive me
Benz tinted, now I'm winnin'
I've been prayin', I've been prayin' for a i8
Gotta get my money straight
Nigga get your mind straight, ya gotta get your mind straight
It all come a time and place
But I'm sick and tired of waitin'
Man that shit's so aggravatin'
I wanna ball, wanna ball
Wanna shine today
Wanna hustle 'fore the sun down
Lord knows 'cause it's midnight
You gotta hustle, get it on your own
Now that's somethin' to pray about

[Verse 3: J.R.]
Every time we lose a nigga, we get T-shirts
And I just got some more clothes
Dirty, it's a cold game
And we handin' out these wardrobes
Ever had to look your nigga dead in his eyes?
Too much blood, you can see the death in his eyes
One last hug, voices screamin', "Leave it to God"
But fuck that bullshit you Shareem, you just a bitch or you ridin
Pray for me
It's been one hell of a weekend
We screwed on the red eyes, it feel like we cheatin'
Red dot, red dot
Now them boys look Indonesian
Only thing I'm thinkin' 'bout, my partner prayin' that I squeeze it
Nigga told me grab a strap, put my feelings in a trunk
Blood told me he want blood and I'ma give him what he want
Ay, visions of the box
Guess I'm cool with that, yeah
I promised his mama I'ma get them niggas back
Should the killers
Convicts, and drug dealers all just forget about Heaven?
What about the bad guy?
Beggin' for a blessin', I pray

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I've been prayin' I'm forgivin'
Treat the man like a mistress
Locked in my own prison
Can't see my own vision
Tryna find me like
Like a nigga gon' miss a straight trip
You see my grandma used to tell me
"Boy say your prayers 'fore you lay"
Make sure
You see my grandma used to tell me
"Boy say your prayers 'fore you lay"
I be prayin', I be prayin', when I see the police now, when I see the police
I be prayin', I be prayin', that they never gun me down, that they never kill me
If I die before I wake

Prayin' that I see another day
Thank God I done seen another day

Tryin' not to lose control
Tryin' not to lose her mind, right, right, right

That's just not me, ooh

That's just not me

[Verse 1: MIKExANGEL]
I can't love 'em, no
And I won't trust 'em, no
A young nigga worked too hard
And I don't wanna hold you up
Cause the money is a motive
I guess the money got me open
And I've been drinkin' for a minute
Shit, that's just how a nigga livin'
She don't wanna go raw
And she gon' go so hard
She keep it so open
While I'm deep in her ocean

[Pre-Chorus: MIKExANGEL]
I can't
Even though I think about what it could be
I tried to love 'em but that's just not me
And I can't
Even though deep inside, I'm incomplete
I tried to love 'em but that's just not me

[Chorus: MIKExANGEL]
Sometimes I feel bad about it
Sometimes I don't give no fucks
And sometimes I want me somebody
But these hoes is just not enough
Sometimes I feel bad about it
Sometimes I don't give no fucks
And sometimes I need somebody
But these hoes is never enough

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
I can't fall no more
I won't let myself
Seems like every time I've tried
I hurt someone else
While I hurt me too
I'm so on the loose
She's so over me
I'm not over you
Yeah I did my dirt
Hit you where it hurt
I put your heart in the mix
Issues that I need to fix
But I guess a nigga focused
They say that money is the motive
Can't you hear, I'm so broken
When it come to love think I'm just hopeless

[Pre-Chorus: MIKExANGEL & Trey Songz]
I can't
Even though I think about what it could be
I tried to love 'em but that's just not me
And I can't
Even though deep inside, I'm incomplete
I tried to love 'em but that's just not me

[Chorus: MIKExANGEL & Trey Songz]
Sometimes I feel bad about it
Sometimes I don't give no fucks
And sometimes I want me somebody
But these hoes is just not enough
Sometimes I feel bad about it
Sometimes I don't give no fucks
And sometimes I need somebody
But these hoes is never enough

[Pre-Chorus: MIKExANGEL & Trey Songz]
I can't
Even though I think about what it could be
I tried to love 'em but that's just not me
And I can't
Even though deep inside, I'm incomplete
I tried to love 'em but that's just not me

[Chorus: MIKExANGEL & Trey Songz]
Sometimes I feel bad about it
Sometimes I don't give no fucks
And sometimes I want me somebody
But these hoes is just not enough
Sometimes I feel bad about it
Sometimes I don't give no fucks
And sometimes I need somebody
But these hoes is never enough

[Outro: MIKExANGEL & Trey Songz]
Never enough
Sometimes I need somebody, but these hoes is
Never enough, never enough
Sometimes I need somebody but these hoes is never enough

[Chorus]
Before we went to the crib, we stopped for waffles and eggs
And she got it crackin' before we got to the bed
Gone off that liquor, still didn't kiss her
Woke up, remember another night with a stripper

Girl, I love to feel your body on mine
We freakin' off late, but your body on time

And she be suckin' that shit all the way home, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]

When I went to Lennox
20 grand in every pocket
That's like 80 wit me
Spent like 30'Grand in Louis ain't been 20 minutes
Parked my Rari in the same place that they park the Benzes
(Laughter)
Haters I despise
Take My glasses off so you can look me in my eyes
They Go for 30 well Gucci gotem for 29
Blowin orange verse (kush) same color Auburn
And Imma call my plug and tell'em bring me all'em
All the niggas in the hood call me Pablo
I got that kush comin in by the car load
Count a hundred thousand dollars up and call her
Since I'm am baller I ain't taking nothing smaller
Hook:
50 thousand dollars on me because I love me to death
Spent so much on champagne, spilled champagne on myself
Still Goin x6 I'm goin goin
Three thousand a room, I'm one hell of a man
He can't beat it up, well I bet you I can
I'm still Goin x6 I'm goin goin
Verse:
It's so hard for me to dance with this pistol in my pants
I got bricks all in my truck
I got bells all in my van
Admire on my left wrist
You should see the diamonds dance
You should see these bitches throw it
Twistin' they ass up how they stand
Sellin' white all night that's all I do
Money stacks as tall as you
Fuckin' broads like ballers do
You broke and thats whats wrong with you
I got a Bently in my pocket, hard to keep my britches up
Better go play with your kids
You don't wanna play with us
Hold up for a second, can I talk for a minute
Admire on every time I handle business
Worth 90 thousand if I took the diamonds out it
Keep the diamonds in it's like 22 hundred thousand
Hook:
Verse:
Wet diamonds in the morning when I'm cooking my eggs
Count 100 thousand then get back in the bed
I'm a trapper and a rapper I don't get no recognition
Cause I juggle two jobs
Flip verses and chickens
My day starts with a play
200K worth of cakes
I got the best of the best
That real Colombian flake
50 thousand in my britches when I come out today
I might go out and play
Drop top Porsche and it's grey
I'm disgusting with these diamonds need to work on my manners
Mixed matched outfits three different designers
Man my pinky ring so bright you can see it from China
And I ain't even have to tell you that the kid is a grinder

[Verse 1]
It's in vogue to be feckless
When it comes to the mother taking care of us
I know it's so conventional
But it don't make no sense at all
But in fact it's a pattern
Everything I hear will always make me ashen
I know it's recognizable
But it don't make no sense at all, oh

[Chorus]
Ooh, no no no sense at all

[Verse 2]
People pay for their coupé
But they can't pay their taxes for the freeway
I know it's so predictable
But it don't make no sense at all
And some people say it's on their radar
But they drive a million miles in their fast car
I know it's so invisible
But it don't make no sense at all, oh

[Chorus]
Ooh, no no no sense at all
Ooh, no no no sense at all

[Bridge]
But in fact it's a pattern
Everything I hear will always make me ashen
I know it's recognizable
But it don't make no sense at all, oh

Ooh, no no no sense at all, oh
Ooh, no no no sense at all, oh
Ooh, no no no sense at all, oh
Ooh, no no no sense at all

[Chorus]
Bone, bone
Bone, bone

[Verse 1]
Hands and toes, feet and head
Carrion to be fed
Any dog can chew over my bone
And all my wine's gonna turn into blood
When my name is called
I'm just a pile of bone

[Chorus]
But when I'm gone
And I'm dead
What will be inside my head?
Bone, bone
Bone, bone

[Verse 2]
Fingernail, chest and feet
Carrion good to eat
Any dog can chew over my bone
And all my wine's gonna turn into blood
When my gun is shot
I'm just a pile of bone

[Chorus]
When I'm gone
And I'm dead
What will be inside my head?
Will all my stitches be un-sewn?
If heaven is a place I know
I won't be taking my bones
Bone, bone
Bone, bone
Bone, bone
Bone, bone

[Chorus]
If heaven is a place I know
I won't be taking my bones
Will all my stitches be un-sewn?
And when I'm gone
And I'm dead
What will be inside my head?
Bone, bone
Bone, bone
Bone, bone
Bone, bone

[Verse 1]
Handshakes and bitter rows
Are the common conjecture
I can dissect anything
And save the skin for later
I know it's just a time
And things will get better
But I don't mind much anyway
Vampire reflection

[Chorus]
Gestured in our selfish understanding
Tensions only surface when you're hurt, h-h-h-hurt
Like a magpie's morning monologue
Whispers bending backwards in the dirt
The dirt, the dirt

[Verse 2]
Make time to say you're right
You should already know this
With next to no pretension
Still, I'm walking on egg shells
Catch your breath, I'm heading out
Be sure others will notice
This is just a product of
Lack of reflection

[Chorus]
Like a magpie's morning monologue
Whispers bending backwards in the dirt
The dirt, the dirt

[Chorus]
Trapdoor, trapdoor, the trapdoor's a trap!
Trapdoor, trapdoor, the trapdoor's a trap!
Trapdoor, trapdoor, the trapdoor's a trap!
Trapdoor, trapdoor, the trapdoor's a trap!
Trapdoor, trapdoor, trapdoor, trapdoor
Trapdoor, trapdoor, trapdoor, trapdoor

[Verse]
And everybody knows what's under the door
And everybody goes to great lengths, for sure
To hide themselves away and keep the beast at bay
'Cause everybody knows

[Chorus]
Trapdoor, trapdoor, the trapdoor's a trap!
Trapdoor, trapdoor, the trapdoor's a trap!
Trapdoor, trapdoor, the trapdoor's a trap!

[Intro]
How much nothing can a dindu do
If a dindu, dindu nothin'
How much money could a dindu make
If a dindu did all the things that you wish to
How much money could a dindu make
How much money could a dindu make
If a dindu did all the things that you wish to
How much nothing can a dindu do
If a dindu, dindu nothin'
How much money could a dindu make
If a dindu did all the things that you wish to

[Verse 1]
I'm a degenerate
Smoke all your cannabis, you cannot handle it
Wave your appendages
Tweetin' and Instagram, camera flick, bitch you was edited
Swear you'll remember this, swear you'll be camera-less
Fuck taking pictures, what's wrong with the vibe?
Might as well dead this shit, I feel alive, ugh
I feel like a part of the life
I feel like I'm starting to die
I feel like I popped in the sky
Get in my space, ha
You'll catch a rocket and ride
I spy (I spy) with my little eye
A target, you mine, all of this mine
All of the shit that I buy, all of the bitches that cry
See 'em from up on the stage, see 'em from up in this cage
See 'em look down on me then I look down on they ways
Mirrorin' you
Look at myself, feelin' it too
Drunker than hell, I'm appearing in twos
Drunker than hell, I'm appearing in yous

[Chorus]
How much nothing can a dindu, do
If a dindu, dindu nothin'
How much money could a dindu make
If a dindu did all the things that you wish to
How much nothing can a dindu do
If a dindu, dindu nothin'
How much money could a dindu make
If a dindu did all the things that you wish to

[Verse 2]
How much nothing could a dindu, do
If a dindu, dindu nothin'
Sent you muffin like a goddamn knight
At my bake, he chef, I cook, fuck sellin'
How much, how much money could a dindu make
If a dindu, did all the things that you wish to
Shit do, I don't need a band on my wrist
Bitch niggas know about it with a pound to the fist
To the head chief, take it to the head chief
If you're making this bread chief
Take it to the head chief
Take it to the head chief
And I'm up and coming, babe, please say something like
How much nothing can a dindu, do
If a dindu, didn't do nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin

[Chorus]
How much nothing can a dindu, do
If a dindu, dindu nothin'
How much money could a dindu make
If a dindu did all the things that you wish to
How much nothing can a dindu do
If a dindu, dindu nothin'
How much money could a dindu make
If a dindu did all the things that you wish to

[Outro]
Dindu, dindu, ayy
How much money can a dindu make
If I dindu did all the thing that you wish to, hey
How much money can a dindu make
If a dindu, dindu nothin', hey
How much money could a dindu make
If a dindu did all the things that you wish to

[Verse 1]
How I'm suppose to say this? Nigga, I don't really know
I don't give a fuck, these niggas think it's way mo'
Always throwing meanings into things, they out of line
I mean it is art I do my part and that is fine
I don't fuckin' rap to be the best or fuckin' shine
I don't want your Grammy
Why she want her titties signed?
What the fuck you doin' up on WorldStar, watchin' Vines
Nigga go outside, bitches so behind

[Chorus]
People fucking with me, I ain't even fuckin' tryin'
I ain't even fuckin' tryin', I ain't even fuckin' tryin'
I ain't even fuckin' tryin'
This whole fuckin' rap sounds like a fuckin' nursery rhyme
This whole fuckin' rap sounds like a fuckin' nursery rhyme
People fucking with me I ain't even fuckin' trying
Even fuckin' trying, I ain't even fuckin' trying
Even fuckin' trying, fuckin' trying
Even fuckin' trying, fuckin' trying
Even fuckin' trying, fuckin' trying
I ain't even fuckin' trying
I ain't even fuckin' trying
Aghaaa!

[Verse  2]
Money-money pour up
How about get sober? (shut the fuck up)
How about you treat your momma right and do your homework? (do your homework)
How about you be the one to buy the fuckin' soda?
When you see a movie with your girlfriend makin' mo' bucks
Tell your kids exactly how important education is
Even if you didn't get a fucking education, bitch
Everybody fucking up on something, we ain't perfect
People out projecting and I see it all the time
I can't waste a breath on something feeble, that ain't right
I'm so sick of texting stupid people all the time
It is in my nature: loving people
I don't even needa, I don't even needa

[Chorus]
I don't need to fucking try, need to fucking try
I don't need to fucking try, need to fucking try
I don't need to fucking try, need to fucking try
I don't need to fucking try, need to fucking try
I don't need to fucking try
Try, try, try, try, fuckin' try, fuckin' try, fuckin' try

[Outro]
Sweet, yes?
Talkin' 'bout your 

[?], talkin' 'bout your-
Salt, bacon, eggs, free-range chicken
Free-range chicken, makin' money

This that hater banger

[Verse 1]
Uh, wetter than Pellegrino
Before he pop that maraschino
He make me call him Tarantino
Oh, oh, oh
Trying to put this all on camera
Showing off your stamina
And stay after hours like a janitor
I got an eighth up in this canister
Smokin' some of that candle stuff
She wear hammy downs
While I handle bucks
No BMX but I handle bars
And these bad boys can't handle cops
Uh, uh, uh
Solo cup, hold those up
Girl goes up on the pole
Go nuts, Y’all don't know that much
But you know I'm drunk
And y'all ain't sayin' nothing
I'm like Darth Vader
Cause I got all of my haters jumping

[Chorus]
This that hater banger
This that hater banger
This that hater banger

[Outro]
And y'all ain't sayin' nothing
I'm like Darth Vader
Cause I got all of my haters jumping

[Intro]
Oh my god, my hair!

[Verse]
I got a bad bitch
Wrap her up in plastic
Lookin' like a chocolate
Valentine's candy
Lookin' at your frame width
Look at what she came with
Fitted with a short cut
But she's still my main bitch
Brain like Cambridge
Smokin' on some dank shit
Money speak a language
Benjamin Franklin
Kudos to my ex-hoe, all on to the next hoe
She can have my kitty
But she ain't touching the cheques though
OVO and XO pink juice sipping'
On a double cup, living like a motherfucking villain
I'm chilling, I'm chilling, I'm posted
And my bitches roll it up so perfect
And we blowing, now we choking
I ain't joking, check the hashtag
Hatchback, Fat man
Going, going, gone
And I ain't comin' back, back
The pigs round the corner
Nigga put it in your backpack
I'm bad for they health
Now they fuckin' with that afflatus

[Chorus]
Short hair mafia
If you with up, stand up
All my bitches with the short cut
Put your fucking hands up (Uh)
P-P-P-Put your fucking hands up
Short hair mafia
Put your fucking hands up
And cut, snip, cut, cut, cut
Snip, cut, cut, snip, cut, cut, cut, cut
Cut, snip, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut
Cut, snip, cut, cut, cut, cut
Snip

[Outro]
You missed a spot
Damn, I look good, ha
And I'mma give out every edition
And put out every mission
And make sure you hear everything that I say
And make sure that listen to every rhythm that I be spittin'
Unconditionally written
P.S to all my enemies you are now forgiven
Except Kid Cudi
Cause that's not my motherfuckin' buddy
If I see him in the streets it's getting motherfuckin' ugly
Now I know you might be a fan
And me and him share similar shit and you like "damn"
But that don't matter
We ain't gonna give nothing to the chatter
We gonna stick to what's at hand
I said "Did you heard that?"
They said "what?"
I said "You didn't heard the thing
About how they gave sixteen shots to McDonalds
While he was on the ground right outside of Burger King?"
They said "How could it?"
I said "You ain't see it?"
He said "Nah, they erased the footage"
Sounds like the motherfuckin' police
That's why sometimes to protect them kids
You gotta keep them pigs on a real short leash
But they protection, for your section
Make sure you have discretion, learn your lessons
Count your blessings, don't be no bitch
Don't be no hoe, but don't be out here stressing
You got a connection
Make sure you protected
Make sure you count your blessings
Make sure that you don't stress
Right, feel me Blake?
Blake you gotta keep shit straight
It's Blake, sometimes these niggas be fake
Blake, sometimes they say that they cold but really them niggas a cake
Blake, you feel me?
You gotta watch out, keep your grass cut low to watch out for the snakes
Blake and if you see they're vampires
And they man's a liar
Make sure you aim at their motherfuckin' heart with them stakes
You feel me Blake? Straight
Shit sound great
Superman flow I should have a motherfuckin' cape
I don't take hoes
Dog I give you my bitch and you can take her on a date
Just make sure you bring her ass back around eight
You feel that Blake?
Straight
I ain't even trying to top that shit
Blake, you know how to do it
Drop that shit

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
This is how it's done, going for the title and crown
Renowned emcees surround as the beat breaks down
Into elements, bobbing of those the Buddha blessed
Finesse the M-I-C, the way it ought to be finessed, yes

Yes, am I the one to keep you on your toes?
Most definitely in my B-boy pose
It's the Electric Boogaloo with a slight twist
Touch your chin to your chest to the rhythm like this:

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
Now I see what I have, I want you
Be with me, or stick and move
Now I see what I had, I want you
Be with me, or stick and move

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Emcees dogging me since the first day I grabbed the mic
Now it's like, "Sit! Stay!"
Cobra Kai flystyles, I'm kicking
Sticking emcees real quick 'cause times ticking
At the drop of a tenpence, I let loose the venom
Sending a shot of verbal heat up in them
The ending is done, grab your family and run
Apocalyptic rhyme pattern taking shots at the sun

Record industry rule four thousand eighty-one:
Question my intentions and your whole world is done
Like Forrest, you'll run, turn your eyeballs into Saturn
Full Metal Jacket, fully auto-rhyme pattern

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
Now I see what I have, I want you
Be with me, or stick and move
Now I see what I had, I want you
Be with me, or stick and move

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda with Mark Wakefield]
Sticking, rock your whole clique and I'm wicked
Moving, booming of our tunes and you're grooving
Sticking, rock your whole clique and I'm wicked
Moving, booming of our tunes and you're grooving

Sticking, rock your whole clique and I'm wicked
Moving, booming of our tunes and you're grooving
Sticking, rock your whole clique and I'm wicked
Moving, booming of our tunes and you're grooving

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
Now I see what I have, I want you
Be with me or stick and move
Now I see what I had, I want you
Be with me or stick and move

[Verse 1]
Finna found a bad girl out in LA
I fell in love with her on the first date
She got "queen" written all over her face
When she gotta go, I just tell her to stay, got a nigga sprung
The way you move your body, girl, you make me wanna love ya
She the only one after I hit it, I just wanna cuddle
She call me "daddy", she ain't never had a father but I'm cool with her mother
She gon' have a baby when we fuckin', we don't never use a rubber

[Chorus]
We gon' take our time and do it right (Do it right)
Take off your panties, leave 'em right here
Girl, you know that pussy belongs to me
You know that body is gold to me
Make it last so start it off slow, then I'ma speed it up

[Verse 2]
Sauvignon blanc, we gon' drink the whole bottle (Oh, oh)
I'ma pop a molly 'cause you know it make me tear it up for hours (Yeah, yeah)
Pussy so wet, squirtin' on a nigga, she done gave me a shower (She done gave me a shower)
Then I put it all in, all in, then she get a little louder, oh
Smackin' on the booty, she done came 'bout three times (Oh)
She gotta go to work in the mornin', so tonight is our free time
And when she get her ass off of work, I'ma take her on a G-5
All around the world, that's my girl, we the best when we high (Oh)

[Chorus]
We gon' take our time and do it right (Do it right)
Take off your panties, leave 'em right here (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Girl, you know that pussy belongs to me
You know that body is gold to me
Make it last so start it off slow, then I'ma speed it up

[Verse 3]
Wanna spend the rest of my life with her
She my ride or die, hold it down for me, that's my nigga
You can get it all from me
I got a wedding ring for you, baby
All I need is for you to say one word and that's "yes"
We go anywhere you wanna go
Makin' love in Italy all way to Monaco
Lookin' at the water when we pull up to the coast
And a candlelight dinner, celebrate and make a toast
Then it's to the bed, you just tell me when to go
Doin' all that freaky shit that's for grown folks
Kissin' on that pussy, know you need a little more
All my heart and all my love

[Chorus]
We gon' take our time and do it right (Do it right)
Take off your panties, leave 'em right here (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Girl, you know that pussy belongs to me
You know that body is gold to me
Make it last so start it off slow, then I'ma speed it up

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Say she coming over late night with some bad bitches
Told her, "Baby have your whole team ready"
I done got so high on the Miley Cyrus
I just need some codeine just to relax
This the new Vivian Millennium, wavy
We don't talk as much as we used to, lately
Send a text through forever, my lady
You done kept it true from the day that you met me
I don't want to get you to ruin your new relations
Showin' tough love, baby, how the streets made me

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Bye bye, baby, goin' bye bye
Had her on the sidelines, now she goin' bye bye
Used to come through, hit it, pull off like a drive-by
Then she got that pool on her so I know her new guy
Nigga had to tie the knot, know that nigga tied the knot
I just had her put up in a penthouse like a jackpot
Same young niggas servin' junkies out the crack spot
Take some well known pussy, eat it 'til she pass out
Take the stripper, smoke some Keisha with her, then crash out

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Still a doughboy so I'm walkin' with the bands out
Take the Dom Pérignon, told 'em gon' carry on
Keep the shit a trillion, and I wanna take the time to get to know you like I should've did my last one
For my new one, for my new one, for my new jump, baby gon'

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Bye bye, baby, goin' bye bye
Had her on the sidelines, now she goin' bye bye
Used to come through, hit it, pull off like a drive-by

I just had her put up in a penthouse like a jackpot
Same young niggas servin' junkies out the crack spot
Take some well known pussy, eat it 'til she pass out
Take the stripper, smoke some Keisha with her, then cash out

[Bridge: Future]
You did it, you made me a better person
You did it, you did it
You made me a better person
You did it, you did it
You made me a better person
You did it, you did it
You made me a better person

[Verse 3: Future]
Shawty comin' over late night with some bad bitches
Told baby, "Have the whole team ready"
Balled so hard last night
Baby called back, say she wanna have another replay
You enjoyed the moment as you should've, spit your game
On the thing, man I should've, started hangin' 'round the gang
She the truest
Put her hands out and bomb, she the truest
Make me pull up with the funds, I'll do it
Support you once, and again I'll do it
You want that brand new Benz, I'll do it
You ain't ever got the time, what you doin'?
You ain't ever did complain when we do it
Now you actin' real strange when we do it
Want your girls on girls when we did it
You ain't ever put the world in our business
You see me, fall in love, I'm the realest
You see me give the game to you, had to read about it on the blogs
Accepted me like a jail call, baby gon'

[Hook: Future]
Bye bye
Baby, goin' bye bye
Had her on the sidelines, now she goin' bye bye
Used to come through, hit it, pull off like a drive-by
Then she got that pool on her so I know her new guy
Nigga had to tie the knot, know that nigga tied the knot
I just had her put up in a penthouse like a jackpot
Same young niggas servin' junkies out the crack spot
Take some well known pussy, eat it 'til she pass out
Take the stripper, smoke some Keisha with her, then crash out

[Outro: Future]
You did it
You made me a better person
You did it, you did it
You made me a better person
You did it, you did it
You made me a better person
You did it, you did it
You made me a better

[Chorus]
Here we are, under the stars
Here we are, under the stars
Heaven is not so far
Heaven is not so far
Heaven is not so far

We'll find a love to hold our hand through the cold
We'll find an angel lying out in the snow
We'll see a light to lead us all the way home and
Wherever we go, we will know

Here we are, under the stars
Heaven is not so far

[Verse 1]
Took my heart, left your sweater
I thought time would make it better
I'm still talking to the pain
I thought that I could be forgiven
With all the letters I have written
But the past is hard to change

You left me at the table
Thinking 'bout the past
Now all I have are memories and photographs

[Verse 2]
I miss our careful conversations
The simple expectations
It was never hard for us
But lately all I can remember
Is that phone call in December
Saying that I'm not enough

Now I'm sitting here at the table
Thinking 'bout the past
Now all I have are memories and photographs
Memories and photographs

[Bridge]
Where oh where oh did you run and hide?
Why oh why oh did you say goodbye?
Is it really goodbye?
Is it really goodbye?

Now I'm sitting here at the table
Thinking about the past
Now all I have are memories and photographs
Memories and photographs
Memories and photographs

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish]
I've been watching you
For some time
Can't stop staring
At those oceans eyes
Burning cities
And napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Chorus: Billie Eilish & Astronomyy]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish]
I've been walking through
A world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature
Made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Chorus: Billie Eilish & Astronomyy]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

Fell in love with her esophagus

[Verse]
Sit and watch the embers, claw marks on the sleeve
I really don't want to leave, I really don't want to leave
I realize there are no answers to rid me of this cancer
Still I really gotta leave, see I really gotta leave
Float in a sea of emotions, taken over by fatigue
I told you I had to leave, I told you I had to leave
Hold my hand in heaven, count the heartbeats and count the seconds
I really don't want to leave, I really don't want to leave

[Verse]
Sit and watch the embers, claw marks on the sleeve
I really don't want to leave, I really don't want to leave
I realize there are no answers to rid me of this cancer
Still I really gotta leave, see I really gotta leave
Drown in a sea of emotions, taken over by fatigue
I told you I had to leave, I told you I had to leave
Hold my hand in heaven, count the heartbeats and count the seconds
I really don't want to leave, I really don't want to leave

[Outro]
I told you I had to leave
I told you I had to leave
I'm happy when I'm alone
Thank you ladies and gentlemen, bye

[Intro]
Ayy-oh, ayy-oh, ayy-oh, ayy-oh

[Verse]
I've been trying to steer, been trying to steer it right
It's apparently clear how I might be screwed
The end is near, said the end is nearing
It's apparently clear we might be screwed
When life loses appeal, when the ghosts appear
Just a kid in the moonlight, just a kid in the moonlight
Headlights on a deer, headlights on the fear
Just a kid in the moonlight

I'm feeling I'm a goner, I'm feeling I'm a goner
I'm feeling I'm a goner
And I got my bed made, so long, sweet dreams (Sweet dreams)
Fuchsia butterflies dizzy, now what am I?
Climb in the shadows, honey, I'm home (I'm home)
It's all by design if I pass out on the lawn

[Chorus]
Then I'll be happy, happy getting shitfaced by myself
Just loathing in my sweet misery
Oh, such manic luxury
Happy, happy getting shitfaced by myself
Just loathing in my sweet misery
Oh, such manic company

[Verse 2]
I got my mind gone, but I love you and you know (You know)
Fumble and mess things up, I can be such an asshole
I said I'm sorry, my lady, I'm so sorry (So sorry, babe)
Keep doing the right thing, you just stay, stay away

[Chorus]
And I'll be happy, happy getting shitfaced by myself
Just loathing in my sweet misery
Oh, such manic luxury
Happy, happy getting shitfaced by myself
Just loathing in my sweet misery
Oh, such manic company
Such manic company

I got my daddy's gun, oh
Such manic company

Once you're in the zone
The river flows down like a full stone
Water is your bed
The ripples cushion your head

[Chorus]
I can't believe it, it is frozen
It's not the first time, I had noticed
She will deliver, I am floating
Trust in the river
I had floated down, floated down
Floated down, floated down
Floated down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)

[Verse 2]
Once you're where I led
It will be clear what I have said
Float without a home
The river flows like another long road

[Chorus]
I can't believe it, it is frozen
It's not the first time, I had noticed
She will deliver, I am floating
Trust in the river
I had floated down, floated down
Floated down, floated down
Floated down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)

Frozen over home
The fading light shines on the white stone
Melt your little zone
And sink into the waterfall flow

She will deliver, I am floating
Trust in the river
I had floated down, floated down
Floated down, floated down
Floated down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)

I've got ideas in my brain about the end of the world that I won't even say
When all the bricks that built our brain will be turned into sand by the eternal wave
Oh, if we save her, we'll live on a star
Mother Nature made everybody else so far

[Refrain]
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?

[Verse 2]
And everybody that I knew
Has jumped right in and taken over you
And I swear, even the ocean's changed its hue
The lesson rings again
Repeats within my brain
Let's all put her to the test
C'mon, suck our mother's breast

[Verse 3]
And everybody that I knew
Has taken bits and pieces out of you
And I swear, even the sky has changed, it's blue
The lesson rings again
Repeats within my brain
Let's all put her to the test
C'mon, suck our mother's breast

[Refrain]
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?

[Verse 2]
And everybody that I knew
Has jumped right in and taken over you

The lesson rings again
Repeats within my brain

I've got ideas in my brain about the end of the world that I won't even say

Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?

I need to slow my mind down low
I need to slow my mind down low

And when it feels like coming on
Boy, it makes it hard to talk for me, for me

[Intro]
I had to put up some kind of a fight

[Verse 1]
It wouldn't hurt to give you more of my love
The sun shone through into a wave of thought
It said the one I'll wed has got a thinking head on her
Her will will shine from up above on us

[Verse 2]
'Cause every day, I build on precious her and I
It wouldn't hurt to put in some work on this angel
I'll fill her heart with a lot of love
So the sun can shine a little brighter

[Chorus]
On her and I
On her and I
On her and I
On her and I

[Verse 1]
It wouldn't hurt to give you more of my love
The sun shone through into a wave of thought
It said the one I'll wed has got a thinking head on her
Her will will shine from up above on us

[Verse 2]
'Cause every day, I build on precious her and I
It wouldn't hurt to put in some work on this angel
I'll fill her heart with a lot of love
So the sun can shine a little brighter

[Chorus]
On her and I
On her and I
On her and I
On her and I

[Verse 1]
It wouldn't hurt to give you more of my love
The sun shone through into a wave of thought
It said the one I'll wed has got a thinking head on her
Her will will shine from up above on us

[Verse 2]
'Cause every day, I build on precious her and I
It wouldn't hurt to put in some work on this angel
I'll fill her heart with a lot of love
So the sun can shine a little brighter

[Chorus]
On her and I
On her and I
On her and I
On her and I

[Verse 1]
I’ve got a God-shaped hole that’s infected
And I’m petrified of being alone now
It's pathetic, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
And I tossed and I turn in my bed
It's just like I Lostmyhead (Lostmyhead)

[Chorus]
And if I believe You
Will that make it stop?
If I told You I need You
Is that what You want?
And I'm broken and bleeding
And begging for help
(There's no use singing a song)
And I'm asking You Jesus, show Yourself

[Verse 2]
I thought I’d met You once or twice
But that was just because the dabs were nice and opening up my mind
Showing me consciousness is primary in the universe
And I had a revelation
I'll be Your child if You insist
I mean if it was You that made my body
You probably shouldn't have made me atheist
But, oh, I’m a lesbian kiss
I'm an evangelist
And if you don't want to go to hell then Miss, you better start selling this

[Chorus]
And if I believe You
Will that make it stop?
If I told You I need You
Is that what You want?
And I'm broken and bleeding
And begging for help
(There's no use singing a song)
And I'm asking You Jesus, show Yourself

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
If I'm lost then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost now then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost now then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost then how can I find myself?
Then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost now then how can I find myself?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If I'm lost now then how can I find myself?
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Somewhere in the world a boy or girl is being buried by their mother
Somewhere in the world there is violence, brother against brother
Do your dance, get in your zone, they can't take you out that

Cause you know how the innocent die
Our sons need love every week, it's a funeral line

See you got to, you got to, oh, no

[Verse 1]
Not a human, not afraid
I will not comply, I will not obey
See the plan is to depopulate
But the body can overcome anything, fuck what a doctor say
Fans shaking me like Bobby wake up
Chip on my shoulder, I was holdin' a grudge
I wanted to be loved more than I wanted to love
But hey, what can I say, fame's a hell of a drug
Born a slave to a tyrant
It's goin' take more than just petitions and riots
Are we headed for a future of being indebted to credit
Hopin' the next leader elected will trump the one we beheaded
Words the wealthiest rappers will never utter
'Them checks they throwin' to niggas a motherfucker'
Seems like the future was brighter when I was younger
(Seems like the future was brighter when I was younger)
I'm torn between performing and rewriting the norm
Am I born to transform or just to die and move on
Be the life that people mourn while reciting all my songs
To the battle I am sword dull armor worn
Beaten down to the pulp for being different
You question old tradition they just say you superstitious
Like a snake that eats its own tail, the economic system
Public schools the babysitter, health care is the modern day Adolf Hitler
Fact check, ever since the internet
Molestation multiplied by a million percent
Your aunts and uncles, niece and nephews all align with the shit
History shows for speaking up my whole life is at risk
Yeah I'm cocky, kamikaze, who gon' stop me? Annunaki
Illuminati? Neo-Nazis? They do me how they do Cosby
When you winnin' they gon' love you till you lose like Ronda Rousey
Every revolutionary they execute 'em proudly
It go JFK, nope, MLK, nope
Since Lennon got smoked, it's clear they don't want us to have hope
They tore down our houses, replaced it with dope
And say that it's our fault, false!

[Chorus]
You wanted to fight
So you wanna be brave
So you found the light and you've seen the truth and you feel betrayed
Well it comes with cost
A price too large
Cause if we're really just born to die
I'd rather never been born at all

[Verse 2]
Stay in school they said, use your tools they said
But being on TV looks pretty cool I said
That's true I said, must I remind myself
These corporations aren't your friends, you should've signed yourself
They, they, who are they? They are us
We are they, the pyramids started at the top, we just mimic and behave
The same way, Babylon brainwaves
Human incarceration's the modern day slave trade
Cost of college, cost of living so high you can't maintain
All you can do is sell pills, drink tea, and waist train
Struggle to make mortgage and re-up by payday
And the wealthiest families split it up eight ways

[Chorus]
You wanted to fight
So you wanna be brave
So you found the light and you've seen the truth and you feel betrayed
Well it comes with cost
A price too large
Cause if we're really just born to die
I'd rather never been born at all

[Hook]
Ooo you in trouble
They 'bout to send them folks to your front door
Ooo you in trouble
Watch out for them foes, you know they cut throat, like
Don't hold your tongue if you ain't scared nigga
Don't hold your tongue if you ain't scared nigga, yeah nigga
Ooo you in trouble
Watch out for them foes, you know they cut throat, like

[Verse 1]
And they be like "you sound retarded
Why you talkin' all that shit, you just a artist
Obviously politics ain't yo' department
You gon' fuck around and make yourself a target"
And I'm just tryna do the right thang, do the right thang, ha
You the right slang, you the right slang, yeah
So just read up who own the stations that your favorite shows come on
Radio stations your favorite songs come on
The truth ain't unknown, even the paper that I'm on
Shit even the label I'm on, shit even the paper that I own
The federal reserve ain't even owned by the government, I'm on some other shit
I'm on a mothership, fuck are we voting for?
Who is this congressman, Fortune 500's
Be funding the Democratics and Republicans
In case you was wonderin'

[Hook]
Ooo you in trouble
They 'bout to send them folks to your front door
Ooo you in trouble
Watch out for them foes, you know they cut throat, like
Don't hold your tongue if you ain't scared nigga
Don't hold your tongue if you ain't scared nigga, yeah nigga
Ooo you in trouble
Watch out for them foes, you know they cut throat, like

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry there's enough wealth in the States
To give a million dollars to each person and they still be straight
I'm talking wealth too big to measure, cheddar that don't fit in the shredder
Treasure that don't fit in a dresser, the best investor for a business endeavour
But you're distracted by the ratchets
By the racket, by the bad bitch
They broadcast the madness using the same crisis actors
They used for the last disaster but you didn't catch it
Remember Katrina when they blew up the levees
All the people that said they was hearing explosions, they chopped out the edit
Tell me do you remember, or would you rather forget it
It's the sixth-Earth parellel world Armageddon
Bandz

[Hook]
Ooo you in trouble
They 'bout to send them folks to your front ...

[Skit]
*Banging at door*
Police, get down! Fuck on the ground. Stop resisting
I'm not resisting, I'm not - I'm not resisting. Y'all, do ya'll see this?
Turn this shit off

[Interlude/Outro]

[Part 1: Behind Ya Back]

[Intro]
Yeah
I'm on some shit, I'm on some shit
I don't want a bitch that don't wanna bitch (Where is that, bitch?)
She been at the gym (Yeah, yeah), eating humus and shit
She crushin' on me cause I'm conscious and shit

[Verse 1]
Bitch, it ain't no time so I'm straight for it, throw them clothes down if you want some
If you ain't 'bout it then don't come, I know I'm the shit 'cause I'm on one
Finna nosegrind like a skateboard, that's your bitch? Well, I ain't sure
You a square, nigga, there's a name for it, you're a four sided ho shape boy (Square)
Niggas act like they don't know where I'm coming from
Niggas act like I'm supposed to stay away from ratchet shit like I ain't from the slums
Niggas act like they don't see me but they always keep my fuckin' letters on they tongue
Internet thugs online but they scary: M. Night Shyamalan
Niggas claim they want my conscious lyrics but ain't appreciate it when they had it
Niggas act like they gon' hold you down but when you need a favor where they hiding?
Bitches act like they ain't hoeing every time another ho is right beside 'em
Yeah we fucked, so what bitch? Go and tell the whole hood about it
You a turkey ass jive bitch, hope you die, bitch, sucking five dicks at a time
Ain't got no type bitch, got a wife bitch and a white bitch, bitch I'm fine
Why deez nigga- why deez nigga- why deez niggas lyin'?
And these niggas ain't loyal either, all these niggas droppin' dimes
Bandz

[Chorus]
Y'all niggas gon' find out about me (Bandz)
It took a while to get back up on my feet (Bandz)
And everything that I say, is blown out of place
If I ain't the shit, why they fly around me?
I'm on some shit, I'm on some shit
You hoes is the feds, I swear I'm convinced
I hit a club, you know they gon' strip
I throw all my money like I'm in love with that bitch, I just fuck on that bitch

[Verse 2]
Look what I gotta do to get respect, that's why I got my boot all in your neck
That's why I never ball without the check, often I get so bored I get depressed
Nowadays it's every man for himself, that's why my loyalty is with the set
I don't know why these niggas fake cool, when they get to actin' I get perplexed
I'm dishonest man and I must confess, I like nigga shit and I like to flex
On my hippie shit, just lost in my head, I forgot that I was still in the flesh
It's too late to try to save who I was, I like bitches and I like to get fresh
How the fuck did Bobby Ray get corrupt? Bobby Ray discovered Bobby himself
And all they can say is you changed, say that you changed
And all they can do to your fame is say that you lame (Man, that nigga lame)
Remember me right, remember me right
'Til the day of my death when I drop in my grave
Bandz

[Chorus]
Y'all niggas gon' find out about me
It took a while to get back up on my feet
And everything that I say, is blown out of place
If I ain't the shit, why they fly around me?
I'm on some shit, I'm on some shit
You hoes is the feds, I swear I'm convinced
I hit a club, you know they gon' strip
I throw all my money like I'm in love with that bitch, I just fuck on that bitch

[Part 2: Purple Mountain]

[Spoken]
New music, 

[mood] music
Baby-making music, your main lady shaking to it
This the feeling teachers never gave to students
Who get paid too little to raise the stupid
Who learn more from gangster music than basic schoolin'
A whole generation of angry youth who get mistaken as a pain or a nuisance
Distracted by the fame and jewelry, a country where we praise the wicked and shame the clueless
When the enemy is within who do you aim the Nuke at?
Are we really at the top or is that just how're we are trained to view it?
I wonder who made the blueprint? Is it the same bloodline that enslaved the Jewish
Built ships and chained us to it, paid a sniper to aim at Luther
Took the World Trade, flew planes into it, and framed the Muslims?
This probably sounds like a scene from your favorite movie
Well wake up, wake up, it don't take brains to do it, it take bank to do it
Welcome to the capital where only the greatest do it
Good intentions is what the road to hell is paved with usually
And bitches swimming bottomless in bottomless ace of spade jacuzzis
Drowning in my own lust, I had to drain the fluid out the group think think tank
I outgrew the fishbowl, I snapped your fucking fishing pole
Fuck opinions, they just want me trapped and fucking pigeon-holed
Now snap a fucking picture hoe
Got me feelin' like I don't get it, you don't get it
Yeah there's truth but who gon' spit it?
Yeah I could say it but who gon' get it?
Complicated fuckin' lyrics, who gon' listen?
We all fuckin' hated math, now who wants physics
I ain't speaking to you all cause you all get it
But see there's projects from Duval to New York City
You ever wonder why it's called the projects?
Picture the statue of liberty in a thot dress
I leave you all to your thoughts to process
Sincerely yours truly, God bless

[Verse 1]
Scientific fact that a nigga strapped
I don't act, I just grab the mac then blow out your back
In fact I will take your life, you won't get it back
This tec slide up on your neck, you should wear a hat
You a snitch, you a fuckin bitch, such a dirty rat

[?]
Stacks on top of stacks
In the booth, but to tell the truth
I used to sling the crack
All up in the Benz with weed
I just had an epiphany
It told me cop some bricks and whip it all up in my kitchen and

[?]

[Hook]
Niggas as real as it get
I chasin after money nigga fuck that bitch
I am what I am bitch I ain't no hoe
Better ask about me in the hood they know

[Verse 2: OJ Da Juiceman]

[Hook]
Niggas as real as it get
I chasin after money nigga fuck that bitch
I am what I am bitch I ain't no hoe
Better ask about me in the hood they know

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
This how gangstas rock
I rap gangsta, ha
White folks tryna hide my uncle Pop
Don't stop, we on top
Never flop, bring me drop

[?]
Run this shit, just to front
I love L's, I love blunts
I love skinny, I love big
I'm the 

[?] fuck the 

[?]
I do this for the bloods
I do this for the crips
I do this for the vice lords
Lame kids and folks
I do this for the weed
I do this for the coke, you can call me Flocka boat
I'm still that same nigga back in Riverdale broke
Cleaner than some soap and I've always been a real nigga
Never been a ho, bitch or a lame ass nigga

[Hook]
Niggas as real as it get
I chasin after money nigga fuck that bitch
I am what I am bitch I ain't no hoe
Better ask about me in the hood they know

[Hook]
It's a dog eat dog world
It’s a dog eat dog world
Me, I'm in the middle
Just tryna keep some calm nerves
Propaganda just like clockwork
Niggas panic just like clockwork
I'm just chilling in the middle
With them crazies and them mobsters

[Verse 1]
It's all about a dollar, it's all about a dollar
This shit feel just like the Hunger Games
Put your family and your squad first
You're more likely to get robbed first
Specially if you balling like they Dyers
Hope you loaded up that Mossberg
.50 cal make you straighten up  your posture
You can't understand us cause we talk slurred
High off of pain pills and cough syrup
You look softer than some soft serve
Been a real nigga since a toddler
If I was you, I would be scared too
News anchors is the feds, too
The sky is fallin', sky is fallin' now
Guess it's time to pull a parachute

[Hook]
It's a dog eat dog world
It's a dog eat dog world
Me, I'm in the middle
Just tryna keep some calm nerves
Propaganda just like clockwork
Niggas panic just like clockwork
I'm just chilling in the middle
With them crazies and them mobsters

[Verse 2]
This might get a little awkward..
This the section where the plot turn..
Been told you bout the cover up
I been told you bout the Watchers
They want to turn us into monsters
They circumcise your cock, first
Vaccinate you second
Desensitize your heart third
Have you ever watched Purge?
Effects are subtle, but the outcome is a lot worse
Psychopath, schizophrenia
Watch us kill each other unbothered
They treat us like a lost herd
We runnin new age thinkers and philosophers
But every guru ain't a 1000
Watch out for imposters
It’s 8pm on a Saturday, and I'm writing to a man in whom I have no faith. Yet still I write because of some uncontrollable naïveté swelling in my belly like an alien child in my human womb. Growing. And kicking. And needing to be released. And so I write.

Here's the thing, Santa.

You and I don't have much in common. We don't see eye to eye. But really, does anyone see eye to eye? Or are we all just looking in different directions, missing eye contact by fractions of inches, walking around looking, never really seeing, and missing the point of this whole game?

Is it even a game?

And if so, is it a game I want to play?

Then again, maybe the game is playing us.

You see where I'm going with this.

Here's my list:

1. A painting of a sparrow perched on a human skeleton.

2-25. Life experience.

26. The wedding dresses of 1,000 women who never followed through.
Christmas is bullshit.

Love,
Fiona

[Verse 1]
Maybe if I sat her
Sat her on her side
She could feel better
She could ease my mind

And I know it ain't easy
Should be easier
You know if you see me
You'll be seeing her

[Chorus]
And she'll be faded
Baby I know you're faded
Everyone looks so shady
Couldn't believe you made it
And you hate it
And I'm faded too
Baby I don't know what to do
Look at us, it's just me and you
Feeling upset for failing
We're faded

[Verse 2]
I wish you could see it
Looking so good
Sally doesn't feel it
Even if she should

And I know it ain't easy
Should be easier
You know if you see me
You'll be seeing her

[Chorus]
And she'll be faded
Baby I know you're faded
Everyone looks so shady
Couldn't believe you made it
And you hate it
And I'm faded too
Baby I don't know what to do
Look at us, it's just me and you
Feeling upset for failing
We're faded

How do I look?

Dealt with the hand I was dealt like poker
Came back with the 45, like Michael Jordan, like Jordan
Started rappin', they was laughin'
Bought a spaceship, bought a mansion, with J-Lo in the Hamptons
Diamonds dancin', I bought me a crib with a lake
Purple drank like grape, bitch jump off like Blake
Diamonds lookin' like steak
Been gettin' real money, since I was so young

Or bitch I'm Harden, I don't miss nothin'
Fuck practice, this shit just happens, know y'all can't stand it

High average, ball on these bastards, it makes me happy
It's tragic, I make it happen, and all y'all Shaqtin'

You gon' think about me when I'm gone

Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Revenge)

[Verse]
Now I could be the change that I wanna see
I can heal the world for real if a nigga speaking honestly
Nat Turner in my past life
Bob Marley in my last life, back again
Look in to the eyes of a young nigga
Who survived against all the odds
Look into the eyes of a young nigga
Who's surprised to be alive
I died 5 years ago, the game snatch a nigga’s spirit yo
My resurrection was a miracle
Cause still I rise, it's ill-advised to bet against him
Raised in hell but heaven sent 'em, let 'em diss 'em
Some niggas can't handle the truth
Some niggas don't know they're slaves
I forgive 'em cause I know their ways
They see a black man shine
First thing they do is throw their shade
Word?—errr—I swerve like a Thunderbird on the curb
Where the cops pursuing, I'm not just doing it
Niggas hate like if I make it ain't a spot for you in it
Have to save the rap game cause I watched them ruin it
So you can take my cock and chew on it
Cock sucker I'm a blockbuster
Motion picture, flows consist of potent scriptures
Known to rip a hole through them so-called dopest niggas
Snatch your soul and pose for pictures, holding it
Revenge of the Dreamers, so vindictive
Back for more, that whack shit's over with
For you niggas sleeping this is Folgers Crystals, wow
In the form of a loaded pistol
Bullets rude, they don't even say "Hello", just kiss you, blaow
Burn in hell with a coat that fits you
When you see the devil
You can tell him Cole just sent you now

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah—higher, higher
Yeah, yeah—higher
Now I can be around, shit, whenever you want
I can be around, shit, whenever you need
Fuck with a nigga, we can touch the stars
Trust in a nigga, you can count on me
I can come around, shit, whenever you want
I can come around, shit, whenever you need
Fuck with a nigga, we can touch the stars
Trust in a nigga, you can count on me
Me, me, me, me, me, me
(Revenge)
And I'm so bored of this
Of how your opinions changed on that Knuckles is pink
So I lay in what you've made
My opinion changed but my outlook stayed the same

Focus if you want to be
Anything in front of me
The only problem is you say that Tails is obviously gay
And I can't find a reason to do exactly what you wanna do
So I'll just pretend that we're just friends again

And how your opinions changed on that Knuckles is pink
So I lay in what you've made
My opinion changed but my outlook stayed the same

Focus if you want to be
Anyone you wanna be
The only problem is you say is that you look just like Penelope
And I can't find a reason to do exactly what you wanna do
So I'll just pretend that we're still friends again
Of how your opinions changed on that Knuckles is pink
So I lay in what you've made
My opinion changed, my outlook stayed the same

Well I found your gate and I took the lock down
Oh, I found your room and I tried your clothes on
I found the kitchen so I put some food on
I found a match and I burned down your house

I found your mum and I tore her dress down
I found your dad and I turned his car on
I found your dolls and I tore their heads off
I found a match and I burned down your house

And I'm so bored of this
How my opinions changed on that Knuckles is pink
So I lay in what you've made
My opinions changed but my outlook stayed the same

[Verse 1]
I swear there's a ghost on this island
And his hands, all covered in blood
And my wife inquired of understanding
But of course, my dear, you can't

She said, "how can I relate to somebody who doesn't speak?
I feel like I'm just treading water"

[Chorus]
Is it the same for you?
Is it the same for you?

[Verse 2]
Well he comes and goes, so capricious
And his work appears so rushed
I love the house that we live in
And I love you all too much

[Chorus]
Is it the same for you?
Is it the same for you?
For you?

[Verse 3]
Criminals and liars
Keep them in your cell as a privilege of mine
And I love the house that we live in
And I love you all too much

You can't stand it, you can't stand it
You can't stand it, you can't stand it
You can't stand it, you can't stand it
You can't stand it, you can't stand it
You can't stand it, you can't stand it
You can't stand it, you can't stand it
You can't stand it, you can't stand it
You can't stand it, you can't stand it all
(You can't stand it, you can't stand it)
(You can't stand it, you can't stand it)
You can't stand it all
(You can't stand it, you can't stand it)
(You can't stand it, you can't stand it)
You can't stand it at all
(You can't stand it, you can't stand it)
(You can't stand it, you can't stand it)
You can't stand it at all
(You can't stand it, you can't stand it)
(You can't stand it, you can't stand it)

[Verse 1]
Well Mr. Jones took a terrible fall
He had built the stairs but he hadn't counted them all
And the lights and the pain said it would rain
He said it would snow
He always said that, wherever he would go
And he would write down his thoughts on the wall

[Pre Chorus 1]
Something about the power of it all
Call if you care for me at all
I've been surrounded by this loneliness
And if I could I would do it all over again
And I would be calm and wait for you
To show me all the things that no one else can do
Now what you need, what you got, what you want from me
I've got the wild inside to conquer and then I'll be free

[Chorus 1]
If I was free, if I was free
I would fly in between the moons of consciousness
And ride on the back of a shooting star
And float into your arms

[Verse 2]
And when he woke up, he went outside and changed the light bulb
Figured out that life was worth living when you could see
The doctor said they'd counseled him before and his tired mind of war

[Pre Chorus 2]
But he was at war with himself and he lost it all
He was at home now feeling the power of the crumbling wall

[Chorus 2]
Oh, if I was free
I'd fly in between the moons of indolence
And I'd ride on the back of a shooting star
And float into your arms
If I was free
I'd let go of all the weight that's dragging me
And never again and never again
I put it all down and never again and never again

[Bridge]
Ahhh
Never again
Ahhh

[Verse 3]
And he met God that day
And God said, "Well, welcome in
I've been waiting for you
Your bed is warm, your sheets are made"

[Chorus 3]
Free, and I was free
I didn't even know that I'd been captured
But I remember the call, I remember the call
I remember when your voice came through the wall
And I was there and I was scared
I didn't even know that you were listening
And all those times I was shaking my head
From all the things I'd said

[Outro]
Ahhh

[Verse 1]
When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom: let it be
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom: let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Speaking words of wisdom: let it be

[Verse 2]
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
Shine on me tomorrow: let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Speaking words of wisdom: let it be, let it be

[Chorus]
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be...

[Verse 1]
My heart is telling me the telly isn't telling me anything
I need but it needs to keep selling me
Besides celebrities lacking in integrity
Holding up the status quo instead of showing the kids
That they matter, who are they gonna batter next?
Just keep holding their necks and keep selling them sex
It’s better if we keep them perplexed
It's better if we make them want the opposite sex
Disenfranchised young criminal minds in a car park beside where your nan resides are not slow, they’ve just never been shown that you should be…

[Chorus]
...loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Oh, oh...

[Verse 2]
We're all human, we're just like you, man
We’re sentient or something or other I can’t remember, whatever
We shouldn't have people afloat
If it was safer on the ground, we wouldn't be on a boat
Charlatan telepathy exploiting insecurity and praying on the purity
Of grief and its simplicity  but I know that maybe I'm too skeptical
Even Guy Debord needed spectacles, you see
I'm the Greek economy of cashing intellectual cheques
And I'm trying to progress, but instead of selling sex...
And I think I should be...

[Chorus]
...loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be...

[Interlude: Spoken Word]
I am forever in alongside the boys in jumpers
On bikes from schools and cars
With autumn leaves fallen sparse across mid-afternoon
She blazed about how cultural language is an operating system
A simple interface rendered feeble and listless
When tested with divinity or a true understanding of the human condition
I never did understand – the duality of art and reality – living life and treating it as such but with a certain disconnect
To touch that cajoles at the artist with comfort and abandon, and between the spires and rolling roofs of the white city
That orange, English light cast only one, singular shadow
For you are not beside but within me

[Chorus]
You should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
(We're all human, we're just like you, man)
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
(We're all human, we're just like you, man)
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Oh, oh...

[Intro]
Hahaha
Blackout, baby

[Verse]
I see shit in the L.A. sky (Uh)
L.A. nights getting too damn high
Codeine in my blood, mud in my Sprite
Nicotine in the bud and the L.A. lights
Fuck all that shit about your human rights
I'ma make it real clear, shit black and white
I don't wanna see your face in my line of sight
Oh boy, try stuntin' on me? It don't happen
Couple Benji's stashed in that mattress
Told her back it up, she ass-backwards
Told her I'ma bring her back to my address
Told her she can have a sip of my Activ'
She gon' smoke on weed and then she gon' ash it
Told her girl, don't be gettin' distracted
Boy, I pull up-up with your whore
That voodoo good so I roll it
Thirteen blunts, boy I smoke it
Thirteen life, boy I know it
Throw four in it when I'm feelin' Whitney
All this drinking is killing my kidneys
All this sip I'm sippin' gon' kill me
And motherfuckers walkin' if they ain't ridin' with me
Teeth shine in my mouth
Bad bitches all on my couch
You know it's foreign when I back out
Hit 'em with the woo-wap, she black out
Boy, I done drank so much I passed out
Hoes fall asleep and all they ass out
Boy, I done drank so much I passed out
Woke up in the spot, I'ma cash out

[Outro]
I see shit in the L.A. sky
I see shit in the L.A. sky
I see shit in the L.A. sky
I see shit in the L.A. sky
No-op
What that work, with chain got in my chain, ridin' round
Got all day, and all things the same
Only this life is my cash to fame
Santa Fe
Santa Fe
Santa Fe
Stoney Maloney

[Intro: R. Kelly]
I don't know if I'ma be able to give you what you want

[Verse 1:  R. Kelly]
No disrespect to the things that you want girl but you fuckin' crazy
Got me working this overtime shift lovin' you but you don't even pay me
And now you wanna blame me
Say it's my fault for your heartache and pain, shit
You created this storm, so don't try to run, baby here come the rain
Tell me how can I trust you when you're still in contact with all of these guys
Do you really think I'ma come home and lay in your bed full of lies

[Pre-Chorus 1: R. Kelly]
You're just an actress, and this love is a scene
But you expect me to show up with a ring
Come on

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Let's be real now
Let's be real now
Come on, come on, come on
Let's be real now
What do I look like to you, seriously?
Come on, let's be real

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
No disrespect to the time that we spent but boy you must be trippin'
You expect me to post up at home for you, but now the tables are flippin'
And now you wanna blame me, cause everyone else realized what they was missin'
I bet you feel dumb now, bet you feel so dumb right now
It's hardly a secret, you fucked with my head
Had me believe it was all because I did it for love
And that was enough
When really you put in no effort instead

[Pre-Chorus 2: Tinashe]
You're just an actor and this love is a scene
Damn I just wish you would say what you mean
Come on

[Chorus: R. Kelly & Tinashe]
Let's be real now
Let's be real now
Come on, come on, come on
Let's be real now
(Real now, real now, oh)
What do I look like to you, seriously?
Come on now let's be real
(Let's be real)

[Bridge: R. Kelly]
There ain't nothin' that I won't do
From jumping off buildings, moving the mountains
Swim the sea for you
Whatever you want babe, I'll do it
You just let me beg, I'll do it
Anything you ask, I'll do it
See that smiling face
There ain't nothin' i won't do for you
Ride or die, I'd take one for you
Any and everything except your fool

[Chorus: R. Kelly & Tinashe]
Let's be real now
(Girl let's be real)
Let's be real now
(Baby come on)
Come on, come on, come one
Let's be real now
(Real now, real now, oh)
What do I look like to you, seriously?
(What do I look like, let's be real)
Come on, let's be real
(Now let's just keep it 100 baby)
Let's be real now
Let's be real now
Let's be real now
Come on, come on, come one
Let's be real now
(Real now, real now, oh)
What do I look like to you, seriously?

[Segue from "Lite Weight"]
"Besides surfing, what do you think about? Love, for instance?
I don't think about it, I make it"

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Baby, there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Yeah, what can we do in here?
What can we do? What can we do?

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
I want you by my lonesome, above this crowded space
It's easier to hold some, when no one's in the way
Well, if no one's in the running for the part
I'd love to pick a day
To show you the main room (Whenever's a good time)
I don't need a bouquet, I just need proper space
Homie three blocks away, I got bottles for days
I got tropical haze, go ahead and wave bye
Let me help with your coat, grab a hold of my arm
Tell them niggas to move, tell your sister you fine

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
'Cause baby, there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Yeah, what can we do in here?
What can we do? What can we do?

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
As crazy as it may seem, it's not too hard to read
It's too many ifs and maybes, and not enough certainty
Well, if no one's putting numbers on the board
I'd love to take a swing, might even graze you
But I don't mean any harm, I'm just speaking my mind
Take a look at that moon, 'bout as bright as your eyes
We got plenty of space, go ahead and recline
Take a puff of that, get a sip of this wine
Yeah, feelin' good?

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
'Cause baby, there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Yeah, what can we do in here?
What can we do? What can we do?

[Verse 3: The Game]
She had a bright smile, big white teeth, I mean
Whiter than her white T, remind me of wifey
Met her at the studio, sort of like a high buyer
She told me she had game so we connected like the wifi
She had this Asian swagger ‘bout her, so I call her mai tai
Started followin' her, she was the only thing on my timeline
And there was this one picture, her in the swimsuit
That made a nigga want to beat it up, and I intend to
But I'ma have to put in work, baby girl, then drink it all
Face like Mona Lisa, I'm just tryna be the wall to hang on
I ain't got no patience, I can't wait long
She come and see me, but she don't stay long
And that's the problem, she a good girl
Maybe it's too much smoke in the room
And she don't want that Mary Jane in her Vidal Sassoon
So I'ma take a minute, and walk her to her Uber
Got a bullet in my heart, and she the shooter
Ay, .Paak

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Baby, there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Yeah, what can we do in here?
What can we do? What can we do?

Nine bathrooms in my crib, I got a pot to piss
My look my momma's face when I bought her a new home
My mom, we finally made it, them hard times is gone
Finally made it legit, ain't no way I'mma quit
Got a cone full of guacamole, let's go get these chips

(Hustlin', hustlin')
This Juicy J and gettin' to the money is all I know

[Hook: K Camp]
When you stay out and your chopper stay focused
She gone be the best
Do what you can when your team get a chance
Put it all to the test
Came for it all, know you heard this before but

Grindin', you fall now you done with the tour

Hustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'

Hustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'
That's all they respect
Hustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'
That's all they respect

You go hard and don't stop until ain't nothin' left

[Spoken]
Good evening ladies, shall we start with horderves?
I can tell your body's been lacking the platter of satisfaction your body deserves
We have reservations and I'm so glad that we're here
Cause I'll be toasting your juices all night like cheers
See you need someone who understands you have a delicate palate
Let me cater to you while indulging in my own bad eating habits
It's a celebration and you're the cream of the crop
Let me *slurps* and I promise I won't leave a drop
But wait, this is just the appetizer
By the time I reach dessert, a climax couldn't get no higher
A leg couldn't shake no harder, we goin' at it so crazy
This love so tasty, I'm talkin' my jelly in your pastry
See baby I got every need, every want, every craving you seek
I'll be going deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper until lemons taste sweet
This is all you can eat from steak to sorbet
Welcome to the buffet

[Intro]
Search for me, find me
Search for me, find me
Search for me, find me
Search for me, find me

You keep searchin'

Love's in your face

[Verse 1]
I'll do anything to please you
Baby, tell me what to do
Let me get out those shoes
I'll be your slave if you want me to
Just give me the chance and I'll prove it babe
There's nobody else that knows how to do it babe
I'm on fire, girl, for you
Wanna burn down this room
Don't you run away from the truth
Whisper in my ear and tell me you feel it too
Girl, why do you

[Chorus]
You keep searchin'
You keep searchin'
You keep searchin'
You keep searchin'
(When) I'm right here, right here
I'm right here, baby
Love's in your face
Shh, shh, shh

[Verse 2]
It don't matter what it is
All the things you need, girl, I'll give
If it's here you want me to live
Snap your fingers, babe (It's like magic)
I want to take you away from this world
To my place of ecstasy and make you my girl
Touchin' on your body, kissin' on your body
I don't want nobody, it's all about your body
You've been driftin', babe
Bring it to me, babe
It's all right here, babe
So stop lookin, babe
Girl, why do you

[Chorus 2x]
You keep searchin'
You keep searchin'
You keep searchin'
You keep searchin'
(When) I'm right here, I'm right here
I'm right here, baby
Love's in your face

[Bridge]
Open your eyes
Said I'm right here, baby just
Open your eyes
And I want you, girl, to be my
Open your eyes
To be my baby
Open your eyes
So stoppin' runnin
Open your eyes
Stop searchin' babe
Open your eyes
What you need is right here
Come and get it
You can have it

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna do your body right
Just come to me, baby
Let me kiss you right there, girl
And I promise you'll come, baby
And I promise you'll feel it, baby
And I promise you won't regret it, baby

[Intro:]
Going crazy my heart is breaking
I can't sleep at all
Trying to get through this
Don't know how I'll do this
I know that I only got my self to blame (only got myself to blame)
But that doesn't help to ease the pain (doesn't help to ease the pain)
I'll just die if I can't see your face

[Chorus:]
Until you come back
I can't breathe
Until you come back
I got no reason
Got my heart, my heart down on it's knees
I still need you beside me

[Verse 1:]
Now it's morning
Your still gone and
I still reach for you (still reach for you)
Don't know how to
Live without you
I wish I can take back all the hurt I've caused
(Take back all the hurt I've caused)
If I could give back all the love I lost
(Give back all the love I lost)
The price I pay is just too high of a cost yea

[Chorus:]
Until you come back
I can't breathe
Until you come back
I got no reason
Got my heart, my heart down on it's knees
I still need you beside me

[Verse 2:]
Please forgive me (forgive me)
Let me have one more chance in your life (one more chance in your life)
Till your with me
I'll be half alive until you come back (back back)

[Chorus:]
Until you come back
I can't breathe
Until you come back
I got no reason
Got my heart, my heart down on it's knees
Cause I need you beside me

[Chorus:]
Until you come back
I can't breathe
Until you come back
I got no reason
Got my heart, my heart down on it's knees
I still need you beside beside beside beside me

[Chorus: Akon]
You just want some
I can tell when you want some
Go to sleep half naked
Throwing hints that you want some
Starting fights in the night for attention
Girl, you want some
Oh, now you just playing?
You just want some

[Verse 1: Akon]
There goes all those things that you was saying when we were leaving
There goes all that fighting we was doing this evening
What happened to the shit that you were saying?
Oh, now you just playing?

[Chorus: Akon]
You just want some
I can tell when you want some
Go to sleep half naked
Throwing hints that you want some
Starting fights in the night for attention
Girl, you want some
Oh, now you just playing?
You just want some

[Post-Chorus: Akon]
Ooh, you in trouble, girl
Ooh, you in trouble, girl

[Verse 2: Akon]
Cause while we spooning, you keep twerking your booty
I feel you moving and getting closer to me
And why you acting all mad?
Girl, you know you wanna do it
You get horny too fast
Girl, I can feel your fluids
Can't be mad at me forever
Girl, cause you wanna come
Oh, now you just playing?

[Chorus: Akon]
Cause you just want some
I can tell when you want some
Go to sleep half naked
Throwing hints that you want some
Starting fights in the night for attention
Girl, you want some
Oh, now you just playing?
You just want some

[Post-Chorus: Akon]
Ooh, you in trouble, girl
Ooh, you in trouble, girl

[Verse 3: DJ Chose]
Most nights, we don't get to sleep much
Chose eat the pussy like free lunch
But tonight, she wanna stunt like she dozed off
But she playing with that pussy like Mozart
Shawty water wet, I see no drought
I can't take her serious with her clothes off
She got her back turned to me with a fake pout
She was waiting on your boy to come and put it out

Chose

[Chorus: Akon]
I can tell when you want some
Go to sleep half naked
Throwing hints that you want some
Starting fights in the night for attention
Girl, you want some
Oh, now you just playing?
You just want some

[Intro: R. Kelly]
Things that I have to say to you
You need to hear
And I know we've got some rebuildin', oh
But I believe time will heal

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Anything that you wanna do
Baby girl I'mma support you
And anything that you're going through
I swear, I will be there for you, you
It's been so many years so I know it feels awkward
Know you had to tuck all your tears in your school locker
And I understand your position
And why your heart went missin'
And things that you wondered

[Pre-Chorus: R. Kelly]
Oh oh-ooh
I know that you mad at me, thinkin' that I didn't care
Talk to me, cause

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
I just wanna be there
When you conquer the world
I just wanna be there
But no matter how successful baby girl
When you need someone to lean on, I just wanna be your shoulder
When you need someone to call on, I wanna be the one to hold ya
I just wanna be there
(Be there, Be there, Be there)
I just wanna be there

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Call me back when I be calling you
Cause I be feelin' like I'm stalking you
And I know you've got issues with rejection, oh
I'm just being honest, I know what you're thinking, never did I neglect ya, no
Cause I love you too much Jo
And I would just kill myself before I do anything to hurt ya
One hunnid, all I ever wanted to do is please you
And I don't know what happened to us but I need you

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
I just wanna be there
When you conquer the world I just wanna be there
But no matter how successful baby girl
When you need someone to lean on, I just wanna be your shoulder
When you need someone to call on, I wanna be the one to hold ya
I just wanna be there
(Be there, Be there, Be there)
I just wanna be there

[Verse 3: Ariirayé]
I know that there were so many things going on
And there were some times I thought I wouldn't make it
But my brothers and me kept each other strong
How do I tell 'em why you're not there
When I don't even know myself
I hate you, I love you, I do and I don't wanna see you
You tell us you need us but that we just need to believe you
My heart is broke, it's so hard to cope
And every night I cry out to heaven cause I need you both more
And sometimes it was easy to not say anything
My mind was at war, "Baby, you're not the enemy"
And it still feels like we're miles away
But I can meet you halfway cause at the end of the day

[Chorus: R. Kelly, (Ariirayé)  & Duet]
I just wanna be there
Be there for you, yeah, yeah
When you conquer the world I just wanna be there
But no matter how successful baby girl
When you need someone to lean on, I just wanna be your shoulder
When you need someone to call on, I wanna be the one to hold ya
I just wanna be there
(Be there, Be there, Be there) 3x
I just wanna be there

[Verse 1]
She said 'hello', she was letting me know
We share friends in Soho
She's a pain in the nose
I'm a pain in women's clothes
"And you're a walking overdose in a greatcoat"
And so she wrote a plan for it on the back of a fag packet
She had to leave because she couldn't hack it
Not enough noise and too much racket
"I think I've spent all my money and your friends, oh"

[Chorus]
Oh, how I'd love to go to Paris again
Oh, how I'd love to go to Paris again

[Verse 2]
Mr. Serotonin Man, lend me a gram
You call yourself a friend?
I got two left feet and I'm starting to cheat
On my girlfriend again
I caught her picking her nose
As the crowd cheered for an overdose
And I don't suppose you know where this train goes
There was a party that she had to miss
Because her friend kept cutting her wrists
Hyperpoliticized sexual trysts
"Oh, I think my boyfriend's a nihilist"
I said, "Hey kids, we're all just the same
What a shame"

[Chorus]
And oh, how I'd love to go to Paris again
And how I'd love to go to Paris again

[Verse 3]
"Oh, stop being an arsehole and counting my eye rolls"
"They're like piss holes in the snow" - uh oh
Keeping a tab on my health
Man you're putting me up on a shelf
"Well I'll believe you're clean
But only by seeing your face for myself"
And then she pointed at the bag of her dreams
In a well posh magazine
I said "I'm done, babe. I'm out of the scene"
But I was picking up on Bethnal Green
She said I've been romanticizing heroin

[Chorus]
And oh, how I'd love to go to Paris, to Paris again
And how I'd love to go to Paris again
And how I'd love to go to Paris again
And how I'd love to go to Paris again

[Verse 1]
Man, I fucked every bitch in Toronto
Livest party in my condo
I got Teesha, Deesha and Donna
It's like Easter pink in my sauna, ha
Fucked up but I'm still drivin'
Fucked up but I'm still drivin'
Nah, I'm playin' that's a joke
Where the fuck is my real driver?
I'm ill droppin', she pill poppin'
They black ballin', I'm still droppin'
And I'm toned up on that rail stop
And them fuck boys never will stop
5'9 and she 5'2
Bad as fuck but she fine too
Fuck is wrong with these hoes, bruh?
My pocket know so I'm fined tuned
And I break a chick, make a chick
Lay down and take a dick
Spendin' the night with your baby like we tryna babysit
Nah nigga, we tryna get at your lady lips
Only hop in and step in our Mercedes whip
Stop, let me get guap
Walk in the room like, "Bitch, let me get top"
Pay me to fuck me bitch, tell me to guap
We got them bitches a penny a pop
Pennies a pop, then they got drop
Man, I'm on top, nigga, damn it, don't stop
Y'all don't want walk where them blamers gon' pop
I say damn it, I wreck it like Hannibal Lecter
Back on my solid, this animal settin'
No actin', no anger just hand me the Tec
I back off the thing and leave chesses like checkers
The freshest don't even come check on my check
And it's pay low and I bailout
We'd be talkin', that's pain up
Foreign car, I'm sittin' tall
It's so hard just to lay low
What's wrong with my wrist? Eyeball, eyelids
She call me cocky 'cause she can't suck my dick
It's too bad I'm too fly, how was your girl? How was your girl?
Two words ooh, ah, come tell my nigga woosah
Drinkin' liquor with my niggas
Wifin' down on like 20 hoes
I know that I'ma get caught but shit nigga, it's plenty more
Hennessy, we can get poured up on Hennessy
Roll up and twist up the remedy
Fuckin' with bitches that's 20 that look like they 23
Tellin' you, you don't want me as an enemy, no

[Chorus]
Call it what you want, call this shit player
She be on it, uh, she fuck with my player
Me, I'm tryna cut, cut, clear
She gon' make them payments
If I think she savin'
Then I might let her fuck
I might let her fuck
I might let her fuck
I might let her fuck

[Verse 2]
Man, what the fuck's wrong with these hoes, bruh?
King shit no cobra
Got a sling clip no shoulder
Strap on a nigga holster
Back on a nigga, back home
Like post ups I'm in the wrong truck
Ghost ridin, hittin' four sluts
My nigga Jay shinin' with the gold cuts
Like G shit, damn nigga, I'm the shit
Caught in it like shark fins, I'm like damn nigga, I'm sea sick
T slick on that G shit
I got a whip colder than my bracelet
Hatin' hard and you ain't my dog, like why you all on that flea shit?
G6, plane flights
J's on, plain flights
Cut you late, I hit your dame twice
And then fuck the frame up in the same night
I'm in a thing tight and what's your name right?
And what's your frame like?
They claimin' I'm drunk drivin'
Get off my dick, I'm in the lane right? Right
Damn it, I'm so on, man I'm more on
Than the main light on the main street
In the daylight with my chain bright
I got a dame white, it's all taint rights
And it ain't right but I do it though
Actin' like you got all that bread
It ain't like you, got too much dough
Where you goin' with all that head?
I ain't up for talkin' I know shorty like my features so
It's I between them double Ds sort of like Adidas
I got hoes as bad as my features
Plus some .44 for the preachers
These shorties know I got heaters
Clip up on ya hip just like beepers
Chicks put on my dick, just like keep the lips
All that shit just between them hips
She pillow bite like she teethin'
I get major brain 'til I'm genius, Lord
They ball, chain my double for time
And your bitch here still callin'
I dig her like we ain't got women I see, I like women spicy like they Cajun
So if I could fuck one word then I'd be fuckin' amazin'

[Chorus]
Call it what you want, call this shit a player
She be on it, uh, she fuck with my player
Me, I'm tryna cut, cut, clear
She gon' make them payments if I think she savin'
Then I might let her fuck
I might let her fuck
I might let her fuck
I might let her fuck

[Outro]
Come my nigga Jay got dough
Got this block on my wrist
If you're lookin' for your bitch, she on top of our dicks, JJ
This all yours, it's T, nigga, you know what I mean, nigga
That beautiful nigga you talk shit at your funeral, nigga
And fuck wrong with these hoes, bruh?
I meet a bad bitch, I might let her fuck
You know what I'm sayin'?
You can't just fuck me for free
I might let you fuck, baby
Can't just fuck me, bitch

[Hook:]
You took a shot, all brick
Had to call the dogs off, they was all on "sick" (Looorrrd)
I rolled the Raw so big, in the car and the fog so thick
Got these brauds so pissed
They want allllll my shit, girl get off my- (Loooorrrd)
Three shots and they all gon' stick
I'm rollin' with an all-star clique

[Verse 1: Church St]
My new tape, too ape
A new week, a new bae
It’s too late for the groom’s sake, Church Street known in a few states (niggaaaaa)
I give em two dates then I Lupe
Tryna fuck some old schoolmates, ‘fore the word get around and they only come around for the coin
I’m too paid and they two-faced
Girls wanna talk, if you cute, I’m a fruitcake
But if not, then I gotta keep it straight witcha
Every Tuesday, I be on the same liquor
Walking out the bank like the main villain
Pockets on Thanksgiving
I drive a Honda and that thang tinted, so they can't see the girl who blaaaaaze in it
When it comes to boys, I'm Asian persuuuuaaaading 'em
Make 'em say my name like my main nigga

[Bridge:]
Oooh I should feel ashamed, but I don't feel a thang
Nah, I don't feel a thang but the painkillers
Yeah, I should feel ashamed, but I don't feel a thang
Nah, I don't feel a thang, nigga!

[Hook:]
You took a shot, all brick
Had to call the dogs off, they was all on "sick" (Looorrrrd)
I rolled the raw so big, in the car and the fog so thick
Got these brauds so pissed
They want allllll my shit, girl get off my- (Looorrrrd)
Three shots and they all gon' stick
I'm rolling with an all-star clique

[Verse 1]
I personify the 'adolescent on a phone'
Speaking like I’m bigger than my body
I personify that lack of freedom in your life
And I'm sure she'll be gone in a second

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me tell you 'bout this girl
I thought she'd rearrange my world
Takes a particular type of girl
To put my heart under arrest
So why's this beating on my chest?

[Chorus]
(This must be my dream)
Wide awake before I found you
(This must be my dream)
I can't wait for you boy
(Wake me from my dream)
What does all our love amount to?
(This must be my dream)
We can't make love when you fly around me baby

[Verse 2]
Pipe down, you're no lover
It's failing 'cause you want it to
Well, I thought it was love but I guess I must be dreaming
'Bout feeling something instead of you

[Pre-Chorus]
"What did I tell you 'bout this girl?"
The one to rearrange your world?
You got excited and now you find out that your 'girl' won't even get you undressed or care about your beating chest

[Chorus ]
(This must be my dream)
Wide awake before I found you
(This must be my dream)
I can't wait for you boy
(Wake me from my dream)
What does all our love amount to?
(This must be my dream)
We can't make love when you fly around me baby
(This must be my dream)
Wide awake before I found you
(This must be my dream)
I can't wait for you boy
(Wake me from my dream)
What does all our love amount to?
(This must be my dream)
We can't make love when you fly around me baby

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus Variation]
(This must be my dream)
Wide awake before I found you
(This must be my dream)
I can't wait for you boy
(Wake me from my dream)
What does all our love amount to?
(This must be my dream)
We can't make love when you fly around me baby

[Chorus]
(This must be my dream)
Wide awake before I found you
(This must be my dream)
I can't wait for you boy
(Wake me from my dream)
What does all our love amount to?
(This must be my dream)
We can't make love when you fly around me baby
Neurodrol can be a lot of trouble. I would rather hire somebody to do the task correctly the first time. It is that company that you can go to with this if you need to get a Neurodrol. Your average Neurodrol usually has dozens of choices. If a man could be found anywhere that did not support Neurodrol I would be surprised. Regardless, this is a plus. After seeing Neurodrol in person I may have to recommend that

I've been doing some product development. How do grownups capture top-notch Neurodrol handbooks? Neurodrol can be a super Neurodrol but that is not without pitfalls

Juice got me loose, but I gotta go all night
When I'm on one, when I'm on one
When I'm on one, when I'm on one

[Chorus]
When I see that ooh I just might
Why is it so wrong if it feels right?
I swear I got no filter, I wanna eat that pussy, no filter
I swear I got no filter, no filter
I'm out of fucks to give
I got no filter, no filter
I'm out of fucks to give
Put you on now with no filter
I got no filter

[Outro]
Ooh I just might
Why is it so wrong if it feels right?
Lick your lips, girl that's my taste
When I'm on one

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
She had never really understood
She demanded her respect
Twenty years of falling under foot
Twenty reasons to regret

You would look for what you couldn't see
Scared to be what she became
She would tell you what you couldn't be
And why you had yourself to blame

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Alone again, you try to disappear
And hold it in, pretending not to hear

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
This voice without a sound
Voice that tears you down
You're trying not to fear, saying this is in your head
But it whispers in your ear, saying this is what you get

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
She was ready with your penalty
When eventually, you'd fall
She was there, inside your memory
Saying this was all your fault

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Alone again, you try to disappear
And hold it in, pretending not to hear

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
This voice without a sound
Voice that tears you down
You're trying not to fear, saying this is in your head
But it whispers in your ear, saying this is what you get

[Melodic Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Alone again, it's all becoming clear
You hold it in, pretending not to hear

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
This voice without a sound
Voice that tears you down
You're trying not to fear, saying this is in your head
But it whispers in your ear, saying this is what you get

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
This voice without a sound
Voice without a sound
This voice without a sound
Voice without a sound

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
This is where the pain comes from
This is how the payback sounds
This is why the fire goes up
This is why the walls come down

You ain't never been in these shoes
Never know a word that I'm saying
So the only thing to keep the blood flowing
Is to let you know I'm not playing

I'ma see your lies exposed
I'ma see the justice done
I'ma see the sun come back
I'ma see the kingdom come

Take it where it can't come back
Take it where the shadows been
Take it to the breaking point
Take it to the end

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Saying that the end is near
God, you have no idea
Used to be afraid, but now
Only thing I fear is fear

This is where the line gets drawn
Something that you've always known
This is what you're hiding from
True fellows, never yours to own

Give me back the fire I had
Give me back the faith I lost
Give me back the trust you broke
Give me back the pride it cost

Take the venom out of my blood
Take the pain you put me in
Take it when I tell you so
Take it to the end
And I'm taking my time
I'm shaping and shaking the rhyme
Like I'm staking my claim
Like I'm making a bomb
I'm making it simple and plain
That I'm sick of the game
Sick of the simple and same
I got that reality rap back to the basics
Give me that beat
It is what its got to be
Cause the rhythms an addiction that I got to feed
You could say what you think that it ought to be
And pop lip to your buddies
Just not with me
Okay?
Cause I'm heavy with the track drums
Cat with the boom bap back in action
Slap all your crew back to a fraction
Rap like a Wu pack on my back, son
And they do, cause the rep stay solid and true
We ought to be probably stop it 'fore we do
Something stupid and ridiculous
Looking so sick of this
Moving music to the life and death until your breath is
Gone

[Verse 1]
When the sun goes down
Record reblown, the horizon comes to life
Blue electric eye
The feeling that haunts me keeps me up at night

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you know where do we go
When we're both stuck in the cold?
City lights, they wait in the dark

[Chorus]
So if the feeling dies, we'll never say goodbye
We'll just replay the 80s, go to a place where we can hide
Only your love can save me
I'm lost in a world of yellow skies, your paradise, paradise

[Verse 2]
When the rain falls down
Watch me clean, baptised up in your love, ay
Many dreams are found
Pulling me deeper, deeper to the light so

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you know where do we go
When we're both stuck in the cold?
City lights, they wait in the dark

[Chorus]
So if the feeling dies, we'll never say goodbye
We'll just replay the 80s, go to a place where we can hide
Only your love can save me
I'm lost in a world of yellow skies, your paradise, paradise

[Bridge]
This is nostalgic
This is our journey so don't stop believing
And you know that I got this
Constantly playing, oh let me going back in time

[Chorus]
So if the feeling dies, we'll never say goodbye
We'll just replay the 80s, go to a place where we can hide
Only your love can save me
I'm lost in a world of yellow skies, your paradise, paradise
So if the feeling dies, we'll never say goodbye
We'll just replay the 80s, go to a place where we can hide
Only your love can save me
I'm lost in a world of yellow skies, your paradise, paradise

[Outro]
Back to the 80s, when music was your life
We can have the greatest time
Back to the 80s, the perfect time
We're back in time

[Verse 1]
This could be easy darling
You can be freaky, I'll be bad
This could be easy darling
If we just let go, know what we meant to do

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl your bright green eyes and your pretty smile got me in the moment
I got your red lipstick all on my neck 'cause that what you wanting
Baby you're gold, you're all I want, silver chains make me belong
My mind is racing, two words, one thought

[Chorus]
Take your high heels off, let's dance some more
Never felt like this before
I can feel it burn inside my head
Can't stop thinking 'bout how I'm gon' take your blue jeans off

[Verse 2]
This could be easy darling
You can be mommy, I'll be dad, ooh
This could be easy darling
If we just let go, girl I'm in love with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl your bright green eyes and your pretty smile got me in the moment
I got your red lipstick all on my neck 'cause that what you wanting
Baby you're gold, you're all I want, silver chains make me belong
My mind is racing, two words, one thought

[Chorus]
Take your high heels off, let's dance some more
Never felt like this before
I can feel it burn inside my head
Can't stop thinking 'bout how I'm gon' take your blue jeans off, take your blue jeans off
Take your blue jeans off
Take your blue jeans off
Take your blue jeans off
Take your blue jeans off

[Bridge]
Girl your bright green eyes and your pretty smile got me in the moment
I got your red lipstick all on my neck 'cause that what you wanting
Baby you're gold, you're all I want, silver chains make me belong
Can't stop thinking 'bout how I'm gon' take your blue jeans off, take your blue jeans off
Take your blue jeans off
Take your blue jeans off
Take your blue jeans off
Take your blue jeans off

[Intro: Nelly Furtado]
A thousand halos in the sky

[Verse 1: Nelly Furtado]
You're the face behind my face
That keeps me dreaming
You're a phase, inside a cage
That keeps repeating

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
We should be dancing with the angels
A thousand halos in the sky
But we're far from Heaven

[Verse 2: Nelly Furtado, Dev Hynes, & Both]
You're the danger (Danger in my life)
And I'm dangerous (Dangerous one)
In my life
You're the page (Danger in my own time)
That keeps on burning

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado & Dev Hynes, Nelly Furtado]
We should be dancing with the angels
A thousand halos fill the sky
But we're too far from Heaven
A thousand halos, you and I
But we're far from Heaven

[Bridge: Nelly Furtado, & Dev Hynes]
And the door is open (Door is open)
A crack of light (Light)
The door was open (Door was open)
I could've stepped inside (Side)
Oh, to be brave, want to be brave
Oh, to be brave, want to be brave
To be brave
In this battle of the ages

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado & Dev Hynes, Dev Hynes, Nelly Furtado]
We should be dancing with the angels
A thousand halos in the sky
But we're too far from Heaven
A thousand halos, you and I
But we're far from Heaven

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
It's Gucci Mane La Flare, and I'm a nigga got weight
A begging ass bitch is really something I hate
Hold on, hold on hoe, baby pump yo brakes
When I took you on a date that was my first mistake
On yo body was the bomb it blew up right in my face
I don't chase these monkey bitches, I'm the one that's getting chased
Yeah, I'm eatin' real good, I gotta say my grace
I might fly a bitch to Paris cause that's just how I play
I might spend a hundred grand, spend it all in one day
And you can come to my place, but damn bitch you can't stay
I'm a social outcast, but my name ain't Andre
I'm smoking California kush, but I'm from Sun Valley

[Chorus]
I wouldn't give a damn if you got grams
I'm in my drop top lamb and I got bands
You the type I give five with my left hand
She left you and then went on to the next man
So put a check, with a check, with a check, fam
You let yo bitch wear the pants so call her yes ma'am
I'm from the crest so I can't hang with no yes man
Steal from the squad and I might have to cut off yo right hand
(Gucci!)

[Verse 2]
I work out at Walter's
I trap a lil harder
I think a lil smarter
I don't wanna be bothered
It's Gucci, imposters
It's Gucci Sinatras
Yo girlfriend just quit ya, wanna get on my roster
I'm draped in La Casta
I'm sippin' on Vodka
I canceled that bitch, and sent that bitch to my partner
You braggin' about her
You say that she slobbed ya'
She set yo ass up and let sum niggas come rob ya
I'm running Sun Valley like Nino did with the Carter
I'm giving you game nigga, don't cost you a quarter
I load my revolver
Go jump in my charger
I pull up on yo ass and turn yo ass to a martyr

[Chorus]
I wouldn't give a damn if you got grams
I'm in my drop top lamb and I got bands
You the type I give five with my left hand
She left you and then went on to the next man
So put a check, with a check, with a check, fam
You let yo bitch wear the pants so call her yes ma'am
I'm from the crest so I can't hang with no yes man
Steal from the squad and I might have to cut off yo right hand
(Gucci!)

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Huh, it's Gucci

[Chorus:]
She choosin but nigga you losin
When I’m cruisin my top I’m losin
In Vegas gamblin’ all night but I’m losin
Just bought a ten pack
I hope it ain’t losin
I bet 50 with the hoes but they losin’
And she a bad bitch so she don’t like losin’
I hope these niggas don’t try me, I’ll lose it
I told her strap everyday and I’ll use it

[Verse 1:]
Bad as hell, got me mad as hell
From her toes to her nails
& Got a tail like a whale
Only time a tell
I’m sending packs in the mail
Imma fool with a scale
And I’m more plugged than the mail
And when my pack hit ATL
It’s like my number just fell
I’m catchin juggs just right before pre-trial
I don’t give no fuck bout no 12
And if all else fails
I’ll be trappin at the tel’
I gotta house in the hills
And a penthouse ? 12
I move ??? like I was Derek Farell
My mama moved me East Atlanta
Like the Prince of Bel Air
Man all the dueces I sold
Man I should get the chair
Ain’t no excuse my nigga
Ask you why you broke as hell
It’s Gucci!

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
A lot of niggas wanna be like Gucci
Fuck around a murder charge like Boosie
I know the feds wanna kill me like Tookie
Yo brother suck a glass dick like Pookie
I was makin music still servin dueces
Walkin just draw salute me or shoot me

I sip lean like a nigga come from Houston
How you feel knowin yo favorite rapper pussy
In his video dancin like Missy
Gold Audemar 90 thousand plain jane
I threw the rocks in it
Cost me 160

[Chorus]

[Gucci Talking:]
Wat happenin
I’ll never date a loser
I went to the casino and lost like a muthafucka
Damn I couldn’t even find the shit I was lost
Police tried to pull me over but I lost them
I lost one of my hoes out there
One of my best bitches
Think I lost track what I was finna say
This bitch must of lost her fuckin mind
Smokin on kush I done lost my keys
I winnin
You losin
It’s Gucci

[Chorus]

[Intro: Gucci Mane]

Pulled up in that black Ghost and I jumped out and I pop shit
Quarter Mill on ice nigga my neck, ears and my wrist lit
It was time dawg when I was fucked up nobody wouldn’t give a nigga shit
So pulled up in that foreign thang niggas already know not to ask for shit

[Intro]
Yeah, my sex is poetic
I'm about to get you mad pregnant
Ha, yeah

[Verse 1]
The first R&B poem
My mic be the knife
I'ma take a stab at it, okay
Allow me to paint the picture, your mind being the canvas
I take you spiritually high, your plane ain't never landing
No navigation locating that spot
When I hit that you yell out "God, that's the G spot"
Sex...
That'll bring you close to tears
When I spit it, it's like I popped a molly in your ear
You feel it between your thighs, your heartbeat starts to rise
Your pupils is dilating, you believe you can fly, man
Niggas can't fuck me, world in my hands
These niggas can't even hold palm in their hands
Pull up in that bassline, snatch you up with these hits
Tie you up with my lyrics, now you're abducted by this shit, uh

[Chorus]
Oh baby (baby)
Come and feed me baby (feed me baby)
Girl put your body on a dinner plate
I just can't get enough of your buffet
And I'm so hungry
Baby feed me
All I can eat baby, I

[Verse 2]
I know, a lot of things on your mind, let me carry them
Get you so wet, welcome to the aquarium
Murdering every bar, shit, I'm a barbarian
Who is he? How dare they make a comparison
Up and down, up and down on my elevator
See I'm the type of nigga that'll elevate ya
Just let that soak in
And I ain't gon' bathe off in that shit, I'ma soak in
It's poker, and I'm going all in
I got you so open all I gotta do is fall in, oooh
And I turned your man to Aaron Hall
My lyrics got a big dick and I just fucked the shit out of y'all
Poetic

[Chorus]
Oh baby (baby)
Come and feed me baby (feed me babe)
Girl put your body on a dinner plate
I just can't get enough of your buffet
And I'm so hungry (I'm so hungry)
Baby feed me
All I can eat baby, I (yeah)

[Verse 3]
Sinner in the shop once I touch her with this taser tongue
Shirt on the clothes line you could say shawty hung
Never caught up but you could say a nigga sprung
Put that up to my ear 'cause I like to hear where you're coming from
Hop up in my rocket ship
We gon' tell them haters bye (bye, bye, bye) yeah
And I represent my sex like I represent my city Chi (Chi, Chi, Chi, Chi)
Yeah, smoking on my melody, yeah you could say we getting high (high)
Yeah, and now I got the munchies 'bout to eat it, call it dinner time
Huh, yeah, okay
Pussy my address, just being honest
And they say home is where the heart is
I'm just metaphorically speaking
Like a ceiling with a hole, I'ma have you leaking
And I, promise you gon' love it
Girl my sex rich, them niggas is on a budget
I make it talk, need no translation
I'm swimming in it, need no floatation
Lock me up in it, need no probation
My Girl, no Temptations
I can make you sweat huh, I turn up the Fahrenheit
Drink from any fountain black or white, shit that's equal rights
I ain't talking hands when I tell your ass to make it clap
Ten out of ten times you came shit that's stating facts
And I love the things you do with your lips when you looking back
Put that pussy right up on my head, that's a fitted cap, uh

[Chorus]
Oh baby (oh baby)
Come and feed me baby (come on and feed me baby)
Girl put your body on a dinner plate
I just can't get enough of your buffet
And I'm so hungry (hungry)
Baby feed me
All I can eat baby, I

[Outro]
Haha, my sex is poetic
Girl let me get you mad pregnant

[Intro: R. Kelly]
Bitch, oh, oh, hey

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
You the baddest in your city I'm the realest in my city
All my home boys rich all your home girls pretty
Pull up, all doors up in that Lamborghini
Wish I could fuck em all
Just playing but anything goes
When you a fine little bitch
And she bad like this
Anything goes
With a nigga this rich
And he shine like this
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
When them diamonds on your wrist
And the engine sounds like this
And you drive slow just so they can see you
Girl, when you got ass like that
And a pretty ass face just to match
I’ma fly you out just to see you
You like to go shopping
I like it when you're topless
I'm being serious but anything goes
Girl you already
And when I say anything, anything goes, anything

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Yeeeaaah
You baddest in the city I'm the trillest in the set
Yeah
All we ever do is smoke weed take shots and have sex
I pull up on Forgis in that Maserati
Said you had to go to work but you still gave me top
Yeah
You know I like that type of shit
I know you like that new Saleen
These hoes so jealous of you and me
What about the passion got up on her shoulder right now
Right now
She probably don't know I know you lonely too
Mmmm, Oh my god, I guess anything goes

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
When that Rollie on your wrist
And your engine sounds like this
And you drive slow just so they can see you
Girl when you got ass like that
And a pretty ass face just to match
I'm fly you out just to see you
You like to go shopping
I like it when you're topless
Let me be serious but anything goes
Girl you already
And when I say anything, anything

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Pull up in that time machine
Ain't shit I would change though
I could buy your whole life
And still have me some change though
I'm just serious
Cause I'm, tired of playing with nigga's
Anything goes if you try me nigga
I throw a check boy I'm talking 8 figures
I put a pool on a jet
I save her number as elevator cause that shit went down when we met
Cause anything goes
Behind closed door
Legs in the air, clothes on the floor
Shit I love when I meet a girl just like me
Cause anything goes
When the bitches look like twins
But they say they're just best friends
Then you know damn well they both want you
Bout a hundred bottles of that Henny
And you've had one too many
And that IHOP is the only thing left to do
Girl what you gonna order
Cause I know my order
You hurry her no particular order
Anything goes
If it wasn't for the finest cars and all the things I got
They would say no, they would say no
And nigga that's real talk
That's why I'm quick to tell these hoes walk
You've had one, you've had them all
Till she came along
And she just changed my mind
Cause I love her demeanor
Man I knew when I see her
I fuck around put a ring on that finger
Anything goes
When I'm feeling crazy
Might just fly you to Haiti
Might go half on a baby
You never know
Anything goes

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
When the diamonds on your wrist
And the engine sound like this
And you drive slow just so they can see you
Girl when you got ass like that
And a pretty ass face just to match
I'm fly you out just to see you
You like to go shopping
I like it when you're topless
I'm being serious but anything goes
Girl you already

[Verse 1]
Nowhere to hide from the truth
Cannot run from what I did to you
There's nowhere for me to point the blame
I did what I did and I'm so ashamed
(That's my bad)
I accuse myself
(That's my bad)
For what has happened here
(That's my bad)
It takes a man who's strong to admit when he's wrong
And so I'm standing here to let you know

[Chorus]
It's all my fault
It's all my fault
It's all my fault
It's all my fault

[Verse 2]
No longer will I act like you caused all of this
Won't turn around the truth no more I've made this nest
Oh you deserve better than what I've shown you
I pray for the chance to make it all up to you
(That's my bad)
I accuse myself
(That's my bad)
For what has happened here
(That's my bad)
It takes a man who's strong to admit when he's wrong
And so I'm standing here to let you know

[Chorus]
It's all my fault
Yes It's all my fault
And I'm sorry babe
It's all my fault
Said It's all my fault
It's all my fault
All my

[Verse 3]
First of all you're not the one whose been untrue
Second of all you deserve someone who's good to you
Third of all the last thing you need is to raise a man
Fourth of all I realise without you I'm lost
Get tired of lying to that mirror on the wall
All of my fingers and I still can't count my flaws
But you hide right in my hands and I dropped the ball

[Chorus]
It's all my fault
It's all my fault
It's all my fault
I did it to myself
Said It's all my fault
See I made my bed
It's all my fault
And now I gotta lay in it lay in it lay in it
It's all my fault
No-one else but me
Are you by yourself
Is there someone else
Baby
I've got a suggestion
Why don't you just
Get out of here with me baby
Cause it's too many people in here
And my house just happens to be near
Not very far away
Right around the corner
Oh baby
Let's get somewhere
Where you can slip out of something and slip in to something
Get out of here with me baby
Cause it's just too many people in here yeah
Far too many people
And I just want a little privacy
Oh
Me and you
There's things I want to do to you I cannot do
Get out of here
Oh my god
Lady, we can take this last drink
And then you'll take a ride with me
And I promise we won't be long
It won't be long
Before we get to my home
Go somewhere else so that I can get you to myself
Get out of here with me
Baby baby, Girl
I want to lay you down, down, down
I want to lay you down
So tell me down babe
Just say it
What do I have to do?
Do I have to go down on my knees
My baby
Begging you, begging you, baby please baby baby please
Get out of here with me
Please baby
Say nothing to no-one and just walk out of here with me
Girl come on cause I promise
Baby you won't be 

[?]
Girl I just want to take, I just want to take
You, I really want to take you
Out of here with me
Get you and lay you down, and make you scream
Hear me talking
In a room full of just us
Exactly what I prayed for
Heaven answer my prayer
Thank you God
Now that I'm here with you
Get ready baby
Cause I'm so ready baby
So ready to explode
In you
I'm so glad that you took my hand when I said
Get out of here with me Baby
Thank you baby
For leaving with me

[Verse 1]
Got nowhere to be
Except right here with you and me
Phone's off no clock
Cause imma hit it non stop
Baby
Yeah your body's talking and I'm listening
You've got my undivided attention
I'm feasting on it like the last meal
Heartbreak baby take me like an Advil woah
Chop and screwed tonight we going slow
Wrap around that thing just like they do the pole
Cause you're the only thing on my schedule
Fuck a club, fuck a flight, girl tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Imma spend some time babe
Imma spend some time babe
Spend some time baby
Imma spend some time babe
Imma spend some time babe

[Chorus]
Spend a little sex time with you

Spend a little sex time with you

Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya

[Verse 1]
I got a mansion
Surrounded by gates
Maybach and a Rolls Royce
Sitting in my driveway
Got a big old yacht
Made of gold and cherry wood
Now you may look at me and think that everything is good
Well I may be smiling like I;m having a good time
But if you look in my eyes you'll see way down deep inside

[Chorus]
I'm  sufferin'
(Sufferin')
I'm  sufferin'
(Sufferin')
I'm  sufferin'
(Sufferin')
Oh yeah
(Sufferin')
I got everything a man could want
But ever since my baby's been gone
I've been sufferin'

[Verse 2]
Well I got so much land
I tell you I could build a city
I been around the world and partied with woman that show up pretty
There's been times when my luck couldn't get no better
But though my sun may shine I got stormy weather
Well I may be smiling like I;m having a good time
But if you look in my eye you see way down deep inside

[Chorus]
I'm  sufferin'
(Sufferin')
I'm  sufferin'
(Sufferin')

(Sufferin')
Oh yeah

But ever since my baby's been gone
I've been sufferin'

[Verse 3]
Hey I got a private jet
Take me anywhere I wanna go
I';m getting big paychecks
From all of my sold out shows
I;m on top of the world living like a boss
Until that girl up and laid me off
Well you may look at me like I'm having a good time
But if you look in my eye you see way down deep inside

[Chorus]
I'm  sufferin'
(Sufferin')
I'm  sufferin'
(Sufferin')
I'm  sufferin'
(Sufferin')
I'm no good
(Sufferin')
I got everything a man could want
But ever since my baby's been gone
I've been sufferin'

[Verse 1]
You shut down when I'm trying to fix it
We both know the end result shit
And we've both done our share of wrong, yeah
Woah, you lock me out
Then you, cast me to the underworld
Talk to me suddenly you, you judging everything that I do
But you want me to be honest with you, yeah
But you ain't trying to be honest with me
So selfish
But despite everything
Despite everything, yeah

[Chorus]
I try (I try), yeah
I try (I try), yeah
I try (I try), yeah
I try (I try), yeah
But I can't but I can't but I can't but I can't
But I can't but I can't but I can't but I can't let you go
Oh no, let you go, oh no

[Verse 2]
Is this just a test of my strength?
The way you come at me, yeah
Point your finger, how are we gonna last, huh
If we keep dwelling on the past?
Woah, you say you're hurting
Well, I get frustrated too
But the bottom line is what do we do
I wish that you were in my shoes, yeah
But I want you to be honest with me
But sometimes I just can't be honest with you
So selfish
But despite everything
Despite everything yeah

[Chorus]
I try (I try), yeah (I tried, I tried, I tried)
I try (I try), yeah (I tried, I tried, I tried)
I try (I try), yeah (I tried, I tried, I tried)
I try (I try), yeah (I tried, I tried, I tried)
But I can't but I can't but I can't but I can't
But I can't but I can't but I can't but I can't let you go
Oh no, let you go, oh no

[Verse 3]
Shorty listen to me
Let's talk not scream
Chips fall down, we can get 'em right back up
Turn things around, chance gonna change our luck
Girl count your blessings
We can have it all right now
You ain't gotta question
My heart is where you are right now, shhh
Let's make love
Don't talk okay, let's just make love
Don't walk away
But I need us to be honest with us
But sometimes it's so hard for us to trust
You're so stubborn
But girl despite everything
Despite everything, yeah

[Chorus]
I try (I try), yeah (I tried, I tried, I tried)
I try (I try), yeah (I tried, I tried, I tried)
I try (I try), yeah (I tried, I tried, I tried)
I try (I try), yeah (I tried, I tried, I tried)
But I can't but I can't but I can't but I can't
But I can't but I can't but I can't but I can't let you go
Oh no, I can't let you go, oh n

[Outro]
See I tried (tried, tried, tried)
You cried (you cried, cried, cried)
I can't let you go, oh no, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
It feels like I'm losing air
I can't catch my breath no matter what I do
And I feel so sick cause you're not there
And girl I need your hand if I'm gonna pull through
Cause I'm lying in my dying bed
And I've been dying since the day you left
Oh
It feels like I'm walking toward the light
I won't live another lonely night

[Chorus]
Cause I'm barely breathin'
Without you
Hoping you will come back home
I'm hanging on
But I'm barely breathin'
Without you
You could save my life with your return
Can't you hear my yearn
I'm barely breathin'

[Verse 2]
It feels just like I've been knocked down
I don't know if I'm gonna ever rise again
And the sky looks like a big dark cloud
GIrl I need you by my side
To help my breathing
You got me lying in my dying bed
And I've been dying ever since you left
It feels just like I'm walking towards the light
And I won't live another lonely night

[Chorus]
Cause I'm barely breathin'
Without you
Hoping you will come back home
I'm hanging on
But I'm barely breathin'
Without you
You could save my life with your return
Can't you hear my yearn
I'm barely breathin'

[Verse 3]
I should be dead by now
But I'm latching on to hopes
That you'll come take me out this coma that I'm in
You still got time, I can't come back from the dark and lonely place
Cause our love is enough reason
For you to start my heart beating

[Chorus]
Cause I'm barely breathin'
Without you
Hoping you will come back home
I'm hanging on
But I'm barely breathin'
Without you
You could save my life with your return
Can't you hear my yearn
I'm barely breathin'
(repeat)

[Hook]
My creator
My creator, my creator, my... creator
Yah!
My creator, my creator
My creator, my creator, my...creator
Yah!

[Verse 1]
My creator said I'mma forever love ya
Through the good and the bad and the ugly
My creator dun't never hold grudges
My creator only one could ever judge me
My creator of conscious was here first
If I'm not conscious the universe was birth
My favorite plant in the dirt
But how that make something illegal that grow up out the earth?

[Hook]
My creator, my creator
Did you ever get the prayers?
A few of us just had a couple questions for ya
A few of us just wanna ask you for a favor

[Verse 2]
My creator you gon' sit around and watch?
My creator you can make all of this stop
You ever notice for a second we in trouble?
You probably think that we all just a bunch of fuck ups
If you was human, what would be your skin color?
Why you let them take MJ from us?
Why you ain't tell MLK take cover?
My creator I'm really starting to wonder
My creator

[Hook]
My creator, my creator, my creator, my... creator
My creator, my, my creator
My creator, my creator, my... creator
Yah!

[Verse 3]
Oh shit, this like the part in The Matrix when he take the red pill and he wake up and go ape shit
They told us we evolved on some ape shit
But I guarantee ya Charles Darwin was a Mason, damn
They like you humans so peculiar
You just appeared after a big bang of gas and started fumin' together to make life
Don't need to think twice
There's nothin' bout you special. You basically sand mites
On this tiny fuckin' speck of dirt called Earth
The only sign of life in the entire Universe
Oh and every star's a billion, trillion miles away
So how the fuck we got a picture of the Milky Way?
Bam

[Outro]
My fellow Americans, we have just discovered a new planet
Uhh.. Although we spent dozens and dozens of years researching and billions and billions of tax payers money researching space and exploring space science, we just saw this planet. We overlooked it. It was hiding behind a blackhole or something, I don't know. But.. but, uhh..  here, he- here are the images
Where are the images? You got the images?

So, here, here are the images clearly as you can see
It's about 8 light years away. Uh.. how do we have pictures?
Uh.. We have, we have super fast, we have million mile internet. Faster than anything Earth has seen, but we just use it for to explore space
Uh.. but I tell ya, yanno you can look at these pictures yourself
We got all the planets. Uh.. but theres nothing out there
I mean, HA! I tell ya, there's nothing out there
Yanno we're gonna keep spending money and keep looking
We're gonna keep sending cameras into space
We're gonna keep sending fucking astronauts into space
We're going to keep going out there and keep sending back CGI
Pictures - I mean, cough cough...
We're gonna keep sending back pictures
Just to let you guys know you're alone
You're alone
And you're insignificant creatures
Signing off

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Anywhere that we go they know us
I keep some KK in the plane rolled up
Shawty say that I'm a gangsta, so what?
If shawty say that I'm a gangsta, so what?
I do my thing, 100k to show up
Keep Bombay and lemonade in my cup
If shawty say that I'm a gangsta, so what?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Shawty say that I'm a gangsta, so what?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Called some friends, told her call some friends
Pour some juice and Gin
We go in, we be going in
We don't know the end
Pour some Gin, she want some more Henn
I'm late for level ten
Love again, never love again, never love again
Niggas talk, they don’t really mean it cause it's all for fame
Look at me, look into my eyes, I been through some pain
Lost some change, then bounced back again
Gave some niggas game, y'all some lames, y'all some lames
Y'all some, y'all some lames
I'm just counting up this money, rolling up a plane
Niggas in my lane, so I'm focused on some other things
When you a boss in the game you show hella patience
Niggas going on your page, don't know where the bank is
She keep blowing up my phone, said she wanna play
Spent one night at my crib, say she wanna stay
I do what I want to, say what I wanna say
I been hustlin', hustlin', I been hustlin'

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa (King Los)]
Anywhere that we go they know us
I keep some KK in the plane rolled up

If shawty say that I'm a gangsta, so what?
Shawty say that I'm a gangsta, so what?
(Yeah, yeah, I shouldn't have hit that KK)

[Verse 2: King Los]
Oh, shit, hold up, hold up, bro I'm focused
Roll up, blow and choke it
Water don't approach us
Fucked the hoe with magic, call it hocus pocus
Los the dopest spoken, flow and stroke the coldest
Stroked the hoe and told her, "Woah, woah, woah catch it all"
Like Pokemon then poke the poke to free 'em
Hokey Pokey, put your left foot in
I put the effort in, no don’t eff with them
I chef with the same shit I'm left with
Cooking with the left, boy, I'm Stephen
Wicked with the right like I'm Leftwich
Spit it to a dyke, get the leverage
Kick it for a night, that's the blessin'
Might hit it twice if I'm guessin'
She'll probably bring her wife to the session
Bitch on wood like Spike at the Knick game
Nice with the dick game, slurp game, twerk game
Pipe in a chick frame, twenty-four seven
More money, more blessings
I ain't got fifty cents for the bitch
I don't ask her twenty-one questions
My nigga's flip yayo, I just put the bucks in the bank
Keep it G with the niggas 'round the way though
You knit that together, you get that
You chit-chat too much, you're a bitch ass nigga
A big ass bitch, that's a BBW
I'm a eighties baby, that's BB's on BMW's
You PMS cause you BS, I serve niggas like UPS
The groupies sweat the coupe
The Gucci sweats, the retro sneaks
The groove too fresh, the proven best
The cool respect the cool
So who are you, the spectical
The new special dude, the next to rule
The extra ruse, I'm extra rude
My ex could prove that I had to make an extra move now...

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Anywhere that we go they know us

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I done smoked weed with the best of them
I got me more money than the rest of them
I'm just doin' big things, I'm finessin' them
Real niggas, ain't too many left of 'em
Left of 'em, ain't too many left of 'em
Left of 'em, ain't too many left of 'em
I'm just doin' big things, I'm finessin' them
Real niggas, ain't too many left of 'em

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Weed and some gin, weed and some gin
She wanna fuck me and her friend, me and her friend
Be there once, we'll be there again, be there again
Fuck her once, then seen in a win, all these Benjamins
Got me spendin' cake like a nigga baked it
Stay away from all the hate, I don't do the fake shit
I got more money to make and soon as I make it
I'ma split it with my gang, sorry if you ain't in
Rollin' weed up on the plane, only smokin' papers
Run up on your main bitch, teach her how to take dick
She ain't even say shit, other niggas' basic
I'm on some outer space shit, come and ride my spaceship
Fucked her and she came quick

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I done smoked weed with the best of them
I got me more money than the rest of them
I'm just doin' big things, I'm finessin' them
Real niggas, ain't too many left of 'em

Left of 'em, ain't too many left of 'em
I'm just doin' big things, I'm finessin' them
Real niggas, ain't too many left of 'em

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I'm intact, I can't fuck with you fuckboys
I'm multi, Tiffany my new toy
Just pulled up in a foreign with a foreigner
Your bitch textin' my phone but I'm ignorin' her
I guess it goes down in the DM
Now I'm burnin' head in the PM
Havin' problems in your house, it might be my fault
I just knocked your bitch on a IO Hawk
Fuck a hater, get some money, yeah them my thoughts
Brown bags in the closet, that's my fault
Bitches fuckin' for designer, niggas killin' for attention
Talkin' million dollar shit when they ain't even seen a million

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I done smoked weed with the best of them
I got me more money than the rest of them
I'm just doin' big things, I'm finessin' them

[Intro]
That shit hard

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I can't even hear what they're sayin'
Roll another plane up, take all the problems, blow it away
And I can't even hear what they're sayin'
I pull up in a ride that's so loud the motor blow you away
And I can't even go where I really wanna go
Cause I'm always on the road, but I'm gettin' dough
And I can't even say how much money I done made
We ain't gotta roll 'em up because they pre-rolled

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
All my bitches roll, all my bitches smoke
All my niggas ride, all my money comin' from the go
All I do is grind, all I do is shine
All I do is take my time, take my place and never wait in line
Had to get my own, had to leave 'em 'lone
Had to fuck your bitch, had to grow some weed, had to get some dough
Pass another one, I got cash enough for both of us
Always rollin' up, smell that weed, you know it's us
Gang

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I can't even hear what they're sayin'
Roll another plane up, take all the problems, blow it away
And I can't even hear what they're sayin'
I pull up in a ride that's so loud the motor blow you away
And I can't even go where I really wanna go
Cause I'm always on the road, but I'm gettin' dough
And I can't even say how much money I done made
We ain't gotta roll 'em up because they pre-rolled

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
3 in the roll, then we lit 3 more, continuous smoke
I don't need yours cause these was rolled 'fore I left the door
Nigga fasho, since 2009, this was the code
We collected and changed the trajectory of the globe
Highed up, sittin' in my '84
The second switch I hit'll make my bad bitch drop it low
I'm out front with the moonroof back
Sparks when the bumper scratch
Better tell 'em that, we done smoked the whole pack

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I can't even hear what they're sayin'
Roll another plane up, take all the problems, blow it away
And I can't even hear what they're sayin'
I pull up in a ride that's so loud the motor blow you away
And I can't even go where I really wanna go
Cause I'm always on the road, but I'm gettin' dough
And I can't even say how much money I done made
We ain't gotta roll 'em up because they pre-rolled

[Intro]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I walk around with bands, I done ran up
Wanted a Bentley, now I want a Lamb' truck
Yeah I got the fix like a handyman
I might take a Xan, fly to Amsterdam
I am with the shits, need a Wet Wipe
My neighbor use antennas for a crackpipe (woah, truuuu)
Pocket full of percs with a 10 on 'em
Pocket full of 100s, not a 10 on 'em
Used to get my cars straight from Hertz
I'ma put my thumb up her skirt
I'ma put my finger on her clit
Couple middle fingers to your clique
All I really need is a shit starter
Smoked a zip and a half, nigga, six quarters
Suede wallpaper, raw paper got me Asian
She want a plastic bag full of caucasian

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
She be in the club off them shit starters
She take all them drugs, that's them shit starters
Tryna fuck a model off them shit starters
Boy don't touch that bottle, that's them shit starters
She be in the club off them shit starters
She take all them drugs, that's them shit starters
Tryna fuck a model off them shit starters
Boy don't touch that bottle, that's them shit starters

[Intro]
Oh

Sonny Digital

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, first place, first place
She want first place, first place
Hit a home run, skipped first base
She want first place, first place
Not the runner-up, she want first place
Cross the finish line, she in first place
First place, first place
First place, first place

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Met her at the club, took her back to my hotel
Say she got a man, fuck her, what? She won't tell
Leavin' out the crib high as fuck, but no plane
Rollin' Mary Jane, now I smoke every day
I blow KK on the regular, fuck me like you said you would
She ain't down to do it, get another bitch instead of her
Bombay on my breathe and all my niggas on your left
Took all your bitches, ain't nothin' left
She sucked a dick, she passed the test
She don't want the runner-up, she want first place
Went to 

[?] and fucked her on the first date
Bitches love Young Khalifa in the worst way
I fuck 'em once and pass 'em off, 'cause I ain't thirsty
Cake like it's my birthday, I sent ya on the lurker page
She come to the show and break me off, now she in first place
She skip past them bitches bullshit and she in first place
Her friend eat it while she suck this dick, now she in first place
Put it all in her face

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, first place, first place, she want first place
First place, hit a home run, skipped first base
She want first place, first place
Not the runner-up, she want first place
Cross the finish line, she in first place
First place, first place, first place
First place, first place, first place

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
Macaroni, pretty Tony, I'm just tryna make the bitch
Pimp, player, ho layer, I'm just tryna break the bitch
Bottom bitch, real slick, you got skills to make me rich
Poodle noodles, face like a poodle ass takin' shit
Double dick
Down south bitch eat that cornbread
Bounce that ass on a hard dick with some warm head
Graffiti on her body, I see she got long weave
Maserati, go to my goal on my skis
And she got a job with a salary
The bitch went to Howard University
Credit good, she can take me on a shoppin' spree
Baby daddy wanna hold her back, lock and key
In the back of the Ghost, gave me head, wasn't scared
She understood in life you gotta cheat to get ahead
It was our first date, I couldn't let her skate
She wanted first place, so I shot a nut in her face

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
This the life we chose, money, cars, and clothes
Takin' trips to different places, livin' like we supposed to
I've been on the road, she outta control
Niggas say they gettin' cake but they ain't even close
I'm just focused on what I'm gettin'
I ain't worried about what I don't got
I'm just focused on what I'm gettin'
I ain't worried about what I don't got

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Top spot, catch me at the top spot
Wouldn't have made it where I'm at if I didn't know a lot
Progress helped me grow a lot
Hit my money, show a lot
Roll my weed up, smoke a lot
Pulled new cars off the parkin' lot
And old ones too
Show love, that's what real ones do
Get my cake long and stay strong
Put my niggas on too
My whips so foreign
My team ballin', my bitch bad, she keep callin'
Them niggas talk? We got heat for 'em
Been in the game, don't sleep on 'em
Hundred K, that's cheap for 'em
What you spend that in a week for?
What you still tryna keep her for?
She was mine, you just think she yours
Chauffeur, I don't open doors
Fly private, know the pilot
On my shit, nigga I'm lit
Got your bitch on my dick
That's Taylor Gang

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
This the life we chose, money, cars, and clothes
Takin' trips to different places, livin' like we supposed to
I've been on the road, she outta control
Niggas say they gettin' cake but they ain't even close

I ain't worried about what I don't got
I'm just focused on what I'm gettin'
I ain't worried about what I don't got

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
I seen it all before, I seen it all before
I gave it to her once and now she wantin' more
Ain't here for all the talk cause I'm just tryna score
That paper pilin' up, that's what they hate me for
I'm on that boss shit, that boss shit
Chasin' money like fuck the talkin'
That ain't a topic, hit your top and
That's a problem, gon' need a medic or a doctor
(?) gon' call 'em, that's just the options
You talkin' like you on molly, somebody stop him
They plottin' like we should rob 'em
They want my riches man
No Welven them niggas sorry
Ain't got no bitches
Just watch me pull up in 'Raris
Hittin' switches

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Time to time
I tell 'em I don't love 'em I just fuck 'em
Then I move on to another one, pass 'em to my brother
Get that pussy under cover, got her ass from her mother
Got my weed straight from Berner, you a nerd so you cuff her
I could hardly trust these bitches I learn they no sucker
On that gas like a trucker, smack the ass when I fuck her
I get plenty love, it's all of the above
I'm on Gin and drugs, give me some
Then it's straight to the club, pockets fillin’ up
Niggas love trynna hate on us, they ain't real enough
Always fill the building up, young and I'm rich as fuck
Text your bitch, I ain't trynna "Netflix & Chill" with her
I'mma roll a joint, give her the best dick she ever had
She don't fuck then I'mma get her bestfriend instead of her
My cash is irregular, I bag bitches everywhere
Got some clothes still got on the tags that I don't never wear
You in last smokin', doin' dabs, I run through the cash

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
They tryna argue nah they lay with all this foreign
You don't believe a word, you hear us all the same
You been here time to time, you heard it all before
After I fuck you once I'll never call again

[Verse 2: Problem]
These bitches be like
Dick hoppin', clique hoppin' for better positions
Pillow talking to any nigga payin' attention
They on a mission tryna fog up a players vision
Fuck then I'm finished, before you leave bitch go clean that kitchen
I ain't gon lie oh yeah the Chacho was a victim once
Before that happened again you will catch me smokin' blunts
And all I do is papers, all I'm bout is paper
Love you for the night, tomorrow we are strangers
You ain't gotta call cause I ain’t
Textin' "Can we kick it?" no reply
You text again like I thought we had a connection
I text back "Bitch I ain't that type of guy"
Gang over everything
Taylor,  Diamond Lane we the reconnected
Bombay and bomb dick bitch is better then expected
Bossed up, fuckin' top so you better not disrespect it
Compton to the fuckin' burbs we connected
Hit the exit

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
They tryna argue nah they lay with all this foreign
You don't believe a word, you hear us all the same
You been here time to time, you heard it all before
After I fuck you once I'll never call again

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Just do somethin' to tell you who I am, ya know?
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (Yeah) uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (High voltage, you can't shake the shock)
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out)

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda, with Chester Bennington,]
It's high voltage, you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage, you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage, you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage, you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington, both]
I've been diggin' into crates ever since I was livin' in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Mastered numerology and Big Bang theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology
Invented the mic so I could start blessin' it
And chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic chords to double-helixes
And show them what I'm made of

I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast the spell of instrumental-ness on all of the MC's that hate us
So try on, (Try it) leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity, let icons be bygones

I firebomb, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit, with or without an accomplice
(Mixed Media) The stamp of approval is on this

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda, with Chester Bennington,]
It's high voltage, you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage, you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington, both]
(Akira)
Put a kink in the backbones of clones with microphones
Never satisfy my rhyme jones
Spraying bright day over what you might say
Blood type krylon, technicolor type A
On highways, bright with road rage
I'm patient to win the cage and the tin to bounce all around
In surround sound, devouring the scene
Subliminal gangrene paintings, overall, the same thing

Sing-song karaoke copy madness
Break bones verbally with sticks-and-stone tactics
Fourth dimension combat convention
Write rhymes at ease while the tracks stands at attention ('Tention)

Meant to put you away with the pencil pistol, official
Sixteen-line, rhyme missile
While you risk your all, I pick out of your flaws
Spittin' raw blah blah blah, you can say you saw

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda, with Chester Bennington,]
It's high voltage, you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage, you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage, you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage, you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
High voltage
High voltage
High voltage
High voltage

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda, with Chester Bennington,]
It's high voltage, you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage, you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage, you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage, you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out

[News Samples]
He could be the most successful rap star in America. His first album sold four million copies. But lately, Snoop Doggy Dogg has been spending more time at the criminal courts building than in the recording studio...

There has been no shortage of controversy for rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg...

News followers called Tha Dogg Pound to say, they're trying to present a positive image in negative times...

Meantime, prosecutors say, indeed so, they are not planning to drop murder charges against rap music star Snoop Doggy Dogg...

Prosecutors may have to drop murder charges against Snoop Doggy Dogg...

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Yea
This is dedicated to the niggas who said gangsta rap was dead
Fuck y'all

[Intro] x16
We Get High

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Johnny always lock a nigga down
Knowing damn well we don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size, ride like Pac
In his prime, thug life is now on radar
Til the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscing when the LA Raiders
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome
And I don't condone dickriding, I'm addicted to
Westsiding, living in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turn me to a lion
Trying, and I mean that shit
Game came through, put the city on his back
I was in the city with a nigga, had seen that shit
"Compton!", a nigga gotta scream that shit
Never went commercial, never T.V. screened that shit
Can't block or screen that shit, now everybody sing that shit

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Smoking, choking, always rollin' something
I don't need a key to start my car bitch, I just push a button
Did a show and got a half a mill and spent it like it's nothing
Money flowing, never sober
Smoking till I got concussions, no discussions
Man I got a condo and got a big crib
Pounds all over my kitchen is
If I ain't on the road gettin' it
Then I'm in the hood where my niggas live
Did a tour, sold it out, just bought a pound 'bout to finish it
Now all my pasta got shrimp in it
You talk about and I'm living it
Fucking little bitch

[Verse 1]
This time she's really out my life, oh
I know I gotta get her back
Just need one night to hit it right
But I can't get her alone, no
Know she deserves to up and leave
If it was me I'd do the same
I see that girl and the life she hopes
So I'll be damned to let it go, damned to let it go

[Chorus]
I discover, discover I love her
Oh, I gotta get her back, oh
I discover, discover that I love her
Ooh, that would get her back

[Verse 2]
I'm guessing this is where it ends (You don't even pick up for a nigga)
I know she's calling all her friends (And they don't like me, fuck y'all bitches)
They probably tryna take her out (All up in the VIP so they can take a picture)
And tryna find her ass a man, shit, make a nigga mad
Cause she know I'm hurting, she know that I'm hurting
Yeah she know I care, she know that I care
I can't understand, know I treat you bad
But you don't get me back like that, no, no
Oh, oh, I gotta get my baby, girl don't leave me
All this crazy shit that you been dealing with it, you probably hate me, hey
Cause baby if you cheated, I couldn't handle that
To know that another nigga is making you smile like

[Chorus]
I discover, discover I love her
Oh, I gotta get her back, oh
I discover, discover that I love her
Ooh, that would get her back

[Bridge]
I can't breathe, yeah
Can't breathe, can't breathe, yeah
Girl let me breathe again, breathe again
Let me breathe again, oh
I can't breath, can't sleep
Can't dream, so weak, girl
Gotta get you back, gotta get you back
Can't think, oh gee

[Chorus]
I discover, discover I love her
Oh, I gotta get her back, oh
I discover, discover that I love her
Ooh, that would get her back
I discover, discover that I love her
Oh, that would get her back

[Outro]
Get you back oh, get you back oh
Can't think girl, oh gee oh, gee oh

[Chorus]
You've been down for me
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one
And you've been riding for me girl
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one
I knew you had my back girl
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one
And I love you for that, you're
My day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one shawty

[Verse 1]
First off, baby that's loyal, most of these girls ain't loyal
And that's why you know I'm gon' spoil and I'd do anything for you
Need your hair done, I'd fix it, want a new bag, I'd get it
Girl you look good, let me kiss you, I wanna spend this money up with you
Pop a couple bands for the rent, take it, that's money well spent
That's for all the money you spent, that's for all the money you lent me girl
Everything that I been through, I ain't 'bout act brand new
Real friends, only got a few and real talking, baby, you the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, if you ask me if I got you, you know what the answer is
You know it girl
Girl you damn right, damn right, damn right, damn right

[Chorus]
You've been down for me
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one
And you've been riding for me girl
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one
I knew you had my back girl
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one
And I love you for that, you're
My day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one shawty

[Verse 2]
Baby I can tell your future, drop top, girl let me scoop you (scoop you up)
And I don't wanna ever, ever lose you, real chick, baby, I salute you
Everything that I been through, I ain't 'bout act brand new
Real friends, only got a few and real talking, baby, you the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, if you ask me if I got you, you know what the answer is
You know it girl
Girl you damn right, damn right, damn right, damn right

[Chorus]
You've been down for me
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one
And you've been riding for me girl
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one
I knew you had my back girl
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one
And I love you for that, you're
My day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one shawty

[Verse 3]
You are the reason why I don't fuck with you niggas
Only the homies from day one
Call up my baby cause we ain't talk in a minute
Name saved as bae in my phone
Give her a minute, when she come over we kissing
She my day one, only one better than all my bitches
Pussy too good when I bang I'm on a mission
Body to body when we changing up positions
I'm like a prodigal, I pick her like eeny meeny miney mo
Hop out the plane like Geronimo, I lock her down like Guantanamo
I give that pussy a taste, put that shit all in my face
She likes the Codeine and the J, baby girl all I can say

[Chorus]
You've been down for me
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one
And you've been riding for me girl
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one
I knew you had my back girl
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one
And I love you for that, you're
My day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one shawty

[Verse 1]
Every time, every time you tell me you gon' change
You're never right, it's probably best we go our separate ways
If you look in my eyes, you gotta know it's true
Told me a million lies but I still tried to make due
Baby, I gave the time and always more
Baby, you got what you want and now I'm paying for it

[Chorus]
Oh, you're supposed to love, with a love that's official
Talking all that shit, it don't mean fuck around and go missing, oh
And don't try to make up cause I'm fine
Cause you're a stranger in my eyes
Stranger in my eyes
You're a stranger in my

[Verse 2]
I'mma be okay, my path is gonna get clearer
Live in the moment, keeping you in my back mirror
What you gonna do when nobody's at home? Yeah
Shoulda thought of that when you turned so cold babe

[Chorus]
Oh, you're supposed to love, with a love that's official
Talking all that shit, it don't mean fuck around and go missing, oh
And don't try to make up cause I'm fine
Cause you're a stranger in my eyes
Stranger in my eyes
You're a stranger in my

[Bridge]
I guess we were meant to fall, fall right out of love
And I can't even say that you were there for me, girl
We were meant to fall, fall right out of love
And I can't even say that you were there for me, yeah yeah, girl you

[Chorus]
Oh, you're supposed to love, with a love that's official
Talking all that shit, it don't mean fuck around and go missing, oh
And don't try to make up cause I'm fine
Cause you're a stranger in my eyes
(Stranger) Stranger in my eyes
You're a stranger in my
Stranger in my
You're a stranger in my, oh oh
Stranger in my

[Chorus]
I'll shoot you down (nothing left)
All that you are (falls apart)
The life you give (burns away)
I'll shoot you down

[Verse 1]
I am the light that ends the night
Do you really have to kill me?(x2)
Are you really going to burn us all?

[Chorus]

[Refrain 1]
This is how it's meant to be
You've got problems if you're only fearing me...
This arrow's pointed straight at you

[Verse 2]
Like a selfless supernova bows before black holes
I'm giving more and more
I'm burning at the core
I'm burning at the core

[Breakdown]
Burn us all (x3) quickly
Burn us all (x3) quickly alive
I dare you to try to end this fight...
It's quite alright

[Bridge]
It's better off this way
Blood spilt on Earth
Can not be seen from space
You know it's better off this way
It's better off

[Refrain 2]
This is how it has to be
There's no problem if you hide your fear from me
This arrow’s pointed straight at you

[Chorus]

I'll shoot you down

[Verse 1]
Early one mornin' the sun was shinin'
He was lyin' in bed
Wondrin' if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said their lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And he was standin' on the side of the road
Rain fallin' on his shoes
Headin' out for the old East Coast
Lord knows he's paid some dues, gettin' through
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 2]
She was married when they first met
Soon to be divorced
He helped her out of a jam I guess
But he used a little too much force
And they drove that car as far as they could
Abandoned it out west
And split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
And she turned around to look at him
As he was walkin' away
She said, "This can't be the end
We'll meet on another day, on the avenue
Tangled up in blue."

[Verse 3]
He had a job in the old north woods
Workin' as a cook for a spell
But he never did like it all that much
And one day the axe just fell
When he drifted down to L.A.
Where he reckoned to try his luck
Workin' for a while in an airplane plant
Loadin' cargo onto a truck
But all the while he was alone
The past was close behind
He seen a lot of women
But she never escaped his mind and he just grew
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 4]
She was workin' in a topless place
I stopped in for a beer
I just kept lookin' at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear
And later on as the crowd thinned out
I's about to do the same
She was standin' there, in back of my chair
Said, "Tell me, what's your name?"
I muttered somethin' underneath my breath
She studied the lines of my face
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 5]
She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said
"You look like the silent type"
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And flowed like burning coal
Pourin' off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 6]
He was always in a hurry
Too busy or too stoned
And everything that she ever planned
Just had to be postponed
He thought they were successful
She thought they were blessed
With objects and material things
But I never was impressed
And when it all came crashin' down
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 7]
So now I'm goin' back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are doctors' wives
Don't know how it all got started
Don't know what they're doin' with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
Headin' for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point of view
Tangled up in blue
michelangelo would’ve wept
if he saw but once where charlie slept
(whoa, charlie, i’m afraid you’ve stepped
beyond the borders of being kept)
what price what price what price disgrace
for sleepin’ on a cherub’s face?

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I been workin’, you been sleepin’
Flex on purpose, for no reason
Make your bitch disappear, black Houdini
Take the top off, like I’m streaking
Compliments feed me, I’m way too conceited
Sharp with my ego, I’m way too strategic
Martin Luther, I’ve been dreaming
Revolution, that’s dangerous thinking

[Hook: B.o.B]
Dangerous thinking, dangerous thinking
They been plotting, keeping secrets
Boycotting mortgage that’s dangerous thinking
Boycotting taxes, that’s dangerous thinking
Boycott authority, dangerous thinking!

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Turn off the TV, it’s way too misleading
Telling them lies, until you believe them
Repeat it, repeat it, repeat it, repeat it
It don’t take a genius to pick up the pieces
I gotta speak in remedial English
Just for my niggas to see what’s the meaning
Straight from the bottom, its hell I done seen it
It’s crazy the devil got that bitch on freezing!
World is so cold, I’m sick with this flow
Swear it’s a blessing, I’m here with these people that’s
Losing lives, people grieving
People starving, I been eating
It’s No Genre, La Familia
We the squad, we the legion
It’s a jungle, on my chest I’m beating
Revolution, that’s dangerous thinking
Bandz

[Hook: B.o.B]
Dangerous thinking, dangerous thinking
They been plotting, keeping secrets
Boycotting mortgage that’s dangerous thinking
Boycotting taxes, that’s dangerous thinking
Boycott authority, dangerous thinking!

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Sometimes I can’t keep control of myself
Some people can’t get a hold of myself
Sometimes I can’t get a hold of myself
So I write a reminder, a note to myself
Saying fuck the whole world, it’s a global affair
I just sold some fire to Smokey The Bear
Times getting hard, any moment I swear
I'mma move in the woods, in the forest somewhere
Saying, fuck all the taxes I owe
Grow a beard and start trafficking blow
Throw a party and shit, its gon' be super lit
Ima call all the ratchets I know
I hear this voice, when I’m sleeping
Either its God, or Morgan Freeman
When you see it, when you see it
Revolution, that’s dangerous thinking

[Hook: B.o.B]
Dangerous thinking, dangerous thinking
They been plotting, keeping secrets
Boycotting mortgage that’s dangerous thinking
Boycotting taxes, that’s dangerous thinking
Boycott authority, dangerous thinking!

[Verse 4: B.o.B]
I am not preaching
Where are your facts, nigga you reaching
I’m peaceful but I stay with hitters that might beat the black off a nigga like, nigga you bleaching!
A lot on my mind, and my line is receding
I jump out my sleep 'cause I keep seeing demons
Just got evicted for no goddamn reason
They probably just mad 'cause I’m black and I’m breathing!
I am not some kind of magical genie
That shits miracles out my ass while I’m sneezing
The work I put into this craft that I’m bringing
Is too transcendental for half of you heathens
It’s no secret, they been watching , getting heated
I’ve been mobbing, taking meetings
Evolution, that’s dangerous thinking
Bandz!

[Hook: B.o.B]
Dangerous thinking, dangerous thinking
They been plotting, keeping secrets
Boycotting mortgage that’s dangerous thinking
Boycotting taxes, that’s dangerous thinking
Boycott authority, dangerous thinking!

on the brooklyn bridge
he was cockeyed
an’ stood on the edge
there was a priest talkin’ to him
i was shiftin’ myself around
so i could see from all sides

an’ things
cops held people back
the lady in back of me
burst into my groin
“sick sick some are so sick”
like a circus trapeze act
“oh i hope he don’t do it”
he was on the other side of the railin’
both eyes fiery wide
wet with sweat
the mouth of a shark
rolled up soiled sleeves
his arms were thick an’ tattooed
an’ he wore a silver watch
i could tell at a glance
he was uselessly lonely
i couldn’t stay an’ look at him
i couldn’t stay an’ look at him
because i suddenly realized that
deep in my heart
i really wanted
t’ see him jump
(a mob. each member knowin’
that they all know an’ see the same thing
they have the same thing in common.
can stare at each other in total blankness
they do not have t’ speak an’ not feel guilty
about havin’ nothing t’ say. everyday boredom
soaked by the temporary happiness
of that their search is finally over
for findin’ a way t’ communicate a leech cookout
giant cop out. all mobs i would think.
an’ i was in it an’ caught by the excitement of it)

an’ i walked away
i wanted t’ see him jump so bad
that i had t’ walk away an’ hide
uptown uptown
orchard street
through all those people on
orchard street
pants legs in my face
“comere! comere!”
i don’t need no clothes
an’ cross the street
skull caps climb

an’ shoeboxes ride

i’ve suddenly been turned into

(i wonder if he jumped
i really wonder if he jumped)
i turn corner
t’ get off river
an’ get off river
still goin’ up
i about face
an’ discover
that i’m on another river

i meet many friends
who look back at me

i don’t know

rocco an’ his brothers

first of all two people get
together an’ they want their doors

enlarged. second of all, more
people see what’s happenin’ an’
come t’ help with the door
enlargement. the ones that arrive
however have nothin’ more than
“let’s get these doors enlarged”
t’ say t’ the ones who were
there in the first place. it follows then that
the whole thing revolves around
nothing but this door enlargement idea.
third of all, there’s a group now existin’
an’ the only thing that keeps them friends
is that they all want the doors enlarged.
obviously, the doors’re then enlarged
fourth of all,
after this enlargement
the group has t’ find
something else t’ keep
them together or
else the door enlargement
will prove t’ be
embarrassing

on fourteenth street
i meet someone
who i know in front
wants t’ put me
uptight
wants me t’ be on
his level
in all honesty
he wants t’ drag
me down there
i realize gravity
is my only enemy
loneliness has clutched
hands an’ squeezes you
into wrongin’ others
everybody has t’ do things
keep themselves occupied
the workin’ ones
have their minds on
the weekends
victims of the system
pack movie theaters
an’ who an’ of what
sadistic company is he
from that has the right
t’ condemn others as trivial
whose fault
an’ who really is t’ blame
for one man carryin’ a gun
it is impossible that
it’s him
slaves are of no special color
an’ the links of chains
fall into no special order
how good an actor do you have to be

(in greece, a little old lady
a worker lady
looks at me
rubs her chin
an’ by sign language asks
how come i’m so unshaven
“the sea is very beautiful here”

i reply
pointin’ t’ my chin.
an’ she believes me
needs no other answer
i strum the guitar
she dances
laughs
her bandana flies
i too realize that
she will die here
one the side of this sea
her death is certain here
my death is unknown
an’ i come t’ think that
i love her)

i talk t’ people every day
involved in some scene
good an’ evil are but words
invented by those
that are trapped in scenes

on what grounds are the
grounds for judgment
an i think also
that there is not
one thing anyplace
anywhere that makes any
sense. there are only tears
an’ there is only sorrow
there are no problems

i have seen what i’ve loved
slip away an’ vanish. i still
love what i’ve lost but t’ run
an’ try t’ catch it’d
be very greedy
for the rest of my life
i will never chase a livin’ soul
into the prison grasp
of my own self-love

i can’t believe that i have
t’ hate anybody
an’ when i do
it will only be out of fear
an’ i’ll know it

i know no answers an’ no truth
for absolutely no soul alive
i will listen t’ no one
who tells me morals
there are no morals
an’ i dream a lot

so go joshua
go fit your battle
i have t’ go t’ the woods
for a while
i hope you understand
but if you don’t
it doesn’t matter
i will be with you
nex’ time around
don’t think about me
i’ll be ok
just go ahead out there
right out there
do what you say
you’re gonna do
an’ who knows
someday
someone might even
write
a song
about you
i used t’ hate enzo
i used t’ hate him
so much that i could’ve killed him
he was rotten an’ ruthless
an’ after what he could get
i was sure of that
my beloved one met him
in a far-off land
an’ she stayed longer there
because of him
i croaked with exhaustion
that he was actually makin’ her happy
i never knew him
sometimes i would see him
on my ceilin’
i could’ve shot him
the rovin’ phony
the romantic idiot
i know about guys for
i myself am a guy
poison swings its pendulums
with a seasick sensation
an’ i used t’ want t’ trample on him
i used t’ want t’ massacre him
i used t’ want t’ murder him
i wanted t’ be like him so much
that i ached
i used t’ hate enzo

there IS a sound
that rings
no praise

but you must be
aware of poor johnny
t’ hear it
you tell me about politics
this that
you speak of rats.
geese. a world of peace
you stumble stammer
pound your fist
an’ i tell you there are no politics
you swear
tell me how much you care
you cheat the lunch counter man
out of a pack of cigarettes
an’ i tell you there are no politics
you tell me of goons’
graves. ginks an’ finks
an’ of what you’ve read
an’ how things should be
an’ what you’d do if . . .
an i say someone’s been
tamperin’ with your head
you jump
raise your voice
an’ gyrate yourself
t’ the tone of principles
your arm is raised
an’ i tell you there are no politics
in the afternoon you run
t’ keep appointments
with false lovers
an’ this leaves you
drained by nightfall
you ask me questions
an’ i say that every question
if it’s a truthful question
can be answered by askin’ it
you stomp
get mad
i say it’s got nothin’ t’ do with
gertrude stein
you turn your eyes
t’ the radio
an’ tell me what a
wasteland exists in television
you rant an’ rave
of poverty
your fingers crawl the walls
the screen door leaves black marks
across your nose
your breath remains on
window glass
bullfight posters hang crooked above your head
an’ the phone rings constantly
you tell me how much i’ve changed
as if that is all there is t’ say
out of the side of your mouth
while talkin’ on the wires
in a completely different
tone of voice
than you had a minute ago
when speakin’ t’ me about something else
i say what’s this about changes?
you say “let’s go get drunk”
light a cigarette
“an’ throw up on the world”
you go t’ your closet
mumblin’ about the phoniness of churches
an’ spastic national leaders
i say groovy but
also holy hollowness too
yes hollow holiness
an’ that some of my best friends
know people that go t’ church
you blow up
slam doors
say “can’t no one say nothin’ t’ you”
s say “what do You think?”
your face laughs
you say “oh yeeeeeaah?”
i’m gonna break up i say
an’ reach for your coat
‘neath piles of paper slogans
i say your house is dirty
you say you should talk
your hallway stinks as
we walk through it
your stairs tilt drastically
your railing’s rotted
an’ there’s blood at the
bottom of your steps
you say t’ meet bricks with bricks
i say t’ meet bricks with chalk
you tell me monster floor plans
an’ i tell you about a bookie shop
in boston givin’ odds on the presidential
race
i’m not gonna bet for a while i say
little children
shoot craps
in the alley garbage pot
you say “nothin’s perfect”
an’ i tell you again
there are no
politics
high treachery sails
unveils
its last wedding song
bang sing the bells
the low pauper’s prayer
rice rags in blossom
blow in a fleet
ribbons in the street
white as a sheet
(a Mexican cigarette)
the people’ve been set
t’ try t’ forget
that their
whole life’s a honeymoon
over soon
i’m not gettin’ caught
by all this rot
as i vanish down the road
with a starving actress
on each arm
(for better or best
in sickness an’ madness)
i do take thee
i’m already married
so i’ll continue as one
faithful done
ah fair blondy
ye lead me blindly
I am in the gravel
an’ down on the gamut
for our anniversary
you can make me nervous
clink sings the tower
clang sang the preacher
inside of the altar
outside of the theater
mystery fails
when treachery prevails
the forgotten rosary
nails
itself t’ a cross
of sand
an’ rich men
stare t’ their
private own-ed murals
all is lost Cinderella
all is lost

[Chorus]
A bird with the word came to me
The sweetness of a honeycomb tree
And now I look what's taking over me
Couldn't fake it if I wanted to
I had to wake up just to make it through
I got my patience and I'm making do
I learned my lessons from the ancient roots
I choose to follow what the greatest do
A bird with the word came to me
The sweetness of a honeycomb tree
And now I look what's taking over me
Couldn't fake it if I wanted to
I had to wake up just to make it through
I got my patience and I'm making do
I learned my lessons from the ancient roots
I choose to follow what the greatest do

[Verse]
I'm repping for the longest cycle, mmm
My uncles had to pay the cost, mmm
My sister used to sing to Whitney, mmm
My mama caught the gambling bug, mmm
We came up in a lonely castle, mmm
My papa was behind them bars, mmm
We never had to want for nothing, mmm
Said, all we ever need is love, mmm
We see the same things
We sing the same songs
We feel the same grief
Bleed the same blood
You grew up in the home beside me
I always had a friend to call
How could I make it here without you? Mmm
I pray I leave before you're gone

[Chorus]
The bird with the word came to me
The sweetness of a honeycomb tree
And now I look what's taking over me
Couldn't fake it if I wanted to
I had to wake up just to make it through
I got my patience and I'm making do
I learned my lessons from the ancient roots
I choose to follow what the greatest do
A bird with the word came to me
The sweetness of a honeycomb tree
And now my luck was taking over me
Couldn't fake it if I wanted to
I had to wake up just to make it through
I got my patience and I'm making do
I learned my lessons from the ancient roots
I choose to follow what the greatest do

[Outro]
Hey, my little youth is crying
I'm almost home, almost home
Look, no further riots, mmm
Working my fingers to the bone
See, I do the best I can, mmm
Mama was a farmer, mmm
Papa was a goner, mmm

[Intro]
Yes, Lord, yeah

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Tried to tell niggas, in 2012, nigga
Working hand to hand and no avail
Volume one was too heavy for you frail niggas
So I got lean like codeine and pills
It's the visionary, in the vintage Chevy
It's been a while but, wow, you still care
Free Nats 'til they pass out obituaries
In bold caps, "your bitch-ass was not there"
And I can do anything but move backwards
The hardest thing is to keep from being distracted
My big sister still claiming me on them taxes
Tell Uncle Sam I just need a second to add this
Gave my mama ten racks
And she packed and went to Chumash with it
Quadruple the worth and give me half of it
Half of it I took in the back of the air mattress
A quarter stash was stashed in a box with the Air Maxes
The rest got lost in Saks with my wifey, no BM
Whack niggas dropping links in my DM
Bad bitches up and down a nigga TL
I'm glad that you finally made it to the future but you're late
And the price is through the muthafuckin' roof
If you want you could wait outside the building
I ain't takin' no more meetings

[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Stepped in the waters
The water was cold
Chilled my body
But not in my soul

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
I bring you greetings from the first church of Boom Baptists
United Fellowship of Free Nationals
Residing pastor is .Paak
And the first lady is a bad bitch
With slanted eyelids and thick ass
Sunglasses, Martin Luther King fan for you bitch niggas
Sweating on my Patent Leathers
Pressure turned their feather weight into a Cinderella
I ain't seen the ground in days since I grew propellers
We'll do one better
Word to the liquor that killed my grandpa liver
I know you finally look proud, a nigga smiling
To every hundred niggas that came and gone missing
Only a handful will go the distance
I swear I seen this shit coming as if I was living up under the plumbing
While niggas was riffing and mumbling 'bout what they could do
I was cooking gumbo whipping the voodoo
I was in the jungle running with Zulu's
We was looking past the struggle while life was moving so fast
You had to be sharp as a Ginsu
To the top of the food group
Doing what I want and how I should, too

[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Stepped in the waters
The water was cold
Chilled my body
But it didn't touch my soul
Stepped in the waters
The water was cold
Chilled my body
But it didn't touch my soul

[Outro]
Ladies and gentlemen, the most fantastic race in history
Nicky Door is trying to explain to the crowd
That what made this race possible
Is underneath this hood
Take a look at this

[Verse 1: Eminem]
The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstanding
Any man planning to battle will get snatched out of his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standing
I'm headed for hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
"Bill Clinton, hit this and you better inhale"
Cause any emcee that chooses to go against me
Is getting taking advantage of like Monica Lewinsky
Came home in a frenzy, pushing a ten-speed
Screaming at Aunt Peg
With three spokes sticking out of my pant leg
Eff a headache, give me a migraine, damn it, I like pain
And you should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowing you wack
You act up and I'm throwing you down a flight of steps
Then I'm throwing you back up 'em
If they don't like the track, fuck 'em
The rap struck 'em harder than getting hit by a Mack truck
And then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper that trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
I'm sicker than a 2Pac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-falling feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'm a climb the Empire State Building
Get to the last step and still have half left

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
Pompous, roll with monsters and dons for accomplices
Cock non-fiction concepts constant
Bomb threat and I ain't even on yet
On spec, I spit thunder and you ain't even seen the storm yet
Lightning in the clouds, start a fight in the crowd
Hyper and loud, get this mic in your bowels, biting my style
Attack all of y'all, react on the thought of y'all
Slaughter y'all, I'm calling y'all, in fact, I'm blackballing y'all
More official than an ordered pistol aimed toward rappers
Blame fame for it, shrapnel bits tore the tissue
Burying the 

[?] under the gravel
Saw off the pump handle and barrel for carrying convenience
My odyssey carries the 

[?], compare me to Phoenix
Solid and hard and light up a star, I got to be Venus
Huddle and bomb back, take cover and all that
And try to not die, you not rugged enough
You just shook as soon as I step foot in this rap game
I'm a bubble on contact like peroxide, I'm touching a cut
You stuck in my raps, 

[?]
Y'all sucking my ass, boosting my confidence a buck and a half
I know the game, I'm a train trapped inside a name
And whoever they taught me, yo, we ride the same
I shoot crews with the truth and chew lies of change
Speeding on a dragon in an attempt to collide with fame

[Verse 3: Eminem]
This 9 is lifting you six feet when I spray rounds
Hit you with six shots in mid-air and four more on the way down
As eight strays graze through a kid's hair on the playground
You lay down on a stretcher (Don't get carried away now)
No pun intended, just hop out of this whip
And leave it unattended 'fore I whip out this gun and end it
Unless you want it dented with bullet holes in one minute
Cause I can leave your Infinit' full of those even if someone's in it
Snatch the airbag, hit the corner and park it
Corner the market, I got her tied up in a chair and gagged
Bitches get slapped and grabbed by the hair and dragged
Like cavewomen while I'm gravedigging with Marilyn Mans'

[Verse 4: Royce da 5'9"]
You get laced by the gun in case you try to run
Hatred on my face by the ton, get baked by the sun
Constructed of interplanetary rock and metal
Topping levels of combustion that's hot enough to stop the devil
Innovative thrust that a enemy
The impact'll be the generated destructive energy to flatten trees
Black boy since birth, burst and tore the womb up
To hit the earth like a asteroid and blow the moon up
Trust me, I'm the epitome, you better bust me
Anybody can say, "Eff 

[me]", and he gon' touch me
Smoking organic ganja inside of a stanza
Me and my man cypher with cans of volcanic lava
Man, and it's hot, I'm out of my head
From the bottom
I can leap out a bottomless pit and land at the top
Raw, that's what I came out here for
To raise an eclipse and occasional trips to the beer store
Switch up the breed of emcee and stick a chick up
Vigorous speed to reach in the sea and pick a fish up
I'm fly against all laws of gravitation
I done crushed all ya'll, now you want a collaboration
But eff that, you stepped up, so I'm a eff your rep up
And tear the rest up with every joint that I press up
So stop violence or violence'll stop you
Got crews iller than anybody on your block do
I roll with a white boy that pop 'shrooms
Listen to rock tunes and jump in a costume and rob you

[Verse 5: Eminem]
What a wonderful day, I should go outside and play
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
"Hi, Renée, I was just about to toss a live grenade
In your driveway and drive away
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS?"
Blood dripping from it
Ripping your stomach up from the waist up
You talk a lot of ish, but you was never ill though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows just for a joke and a laugh
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Waging wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with Agent Orange
And wiped my ass with his page in Source
Demon is here, I'm steaming this year
I rip Mystikal's voice box out and scream in his ear
It's not a gimmick, trick, it's an image, I live it
Give a what? I don't know what a "what" is to give it

[Verse 6: Royce da 5'9"]
I grab your throat and squeeze it until it's swollen
Then exceed it until it explodes over your shoulders
Pick up your urn with ashes in it and piss in it
Diss intended to verge like a hearse with a witch in it
No more do I battle emcees for fun
Now it's guns and niggas should run from the 

[?]
It's barely vivid you witness rare exhibits of terrorism
Through Israel and the art when even they're dark and dismal
I'm a deranged breed, shoot me
I'll catch a bullet in my teeth
And spit it right back at you at the same speed
I'll injure if I'm offending you, we can go to blows
Even my interview should be a Hip-Hop Quotable
You can have the title, that's for brothers that's cocky
I'll take the belt with diamonds in it like Ted DiBiase
I'm rebelling your chains, in fact, you wack
I'm telling you the plane still spelling your name in your raps
You're soft-hearted, I'll say, "Let's take it to the streets"
You'll start pleading with me before we can get the walk started
I'm a deranged breed, so don't try to touch this
5'9", I told you I don't know the chorus

[Verse 7: Eminem]
Forget a chorus, my metaphors are so complicated
It takes six minutes to get applause
And by the time you all catch on, I'm a end your career
And walk away with the floor, so you have nothing to fall back on
I'll throw you out of ten floors
Pull a freaking headache out of my head and put it in yours
I'm indoors, waiting for this acid to seep in my skin pores
To go outdoors and do some in-stores
This trick wanted to blow me, I said, "It ought to happen"
"You swallow nut, girl?" "No, but I brought a napkin"
Getting skully while I'm autographing
Got my daughter laughing
Cause I sent her mother white water rafting
I'm not a fact, I'm a proven fear
Mr. Rogers blocking my U-Haul
Screaming, "You ain't moving here"
"Lorena Bobbitt, come here, want a souvenir?
I've been high as "L" since I was a juven-eer
Juvenile? Same difference, I need some 'caine
Cause I ain't sniffed since I woke up to seven slain infants
Brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
I won't stay the same cause I traded brains with a chimpanz'

[Verse]
Holy assumption of man into the heaven's sphere
Many mansions fit champions within its seven tiers
Evangelists re-imagine every 11 years
Pause for applause, evolves to what was never here
Born to death, born to die
Form the flesh, form the eyes
A veritable storm of winged forms swarms the skies
Marital norms unperformed but the porn survives
In the dorms of the scorn, they keep warm supplies
Gone to lose the use of tooth, horn and thigh
Before I was standing, I was landing
Two one-hand, one-man bands jamming in tandem
He who power naps, then plans gathering ransoms
And maps man's laps in a hand lathered in absinthe
Got a talent trafficking ramblings
And handing out amazing handmade maps of the labyrinth
Out the back of the wagon, out the back of the madam
Out the back of the Magnum, then out the trap of enchantment
Bellerophon with a megaphone, Mega Man
Desert zone, run marathons with sweaters on (sweaters on)
That was so simple but hot
In a place where it's so simple but not
Closed temples and old little forgots
And rode whole chisels, cripples who won't miss a salat
The old hoes that they won't give you a shot
But you can get the whole  pistol, it's gon' hit you a lot
These are real words from a savage mind
Unmaximized man on an average climb
Who don't deserve the whole truth and only half your time
Fit the life of a whole booth in only half a line
In the future life, I don't even have to rhyme
We'll get the entire Armageddon with only half the signs
Just yields and rail roads
In lush fields with bell tolls
Couple huddles of the unskilled but well told
It's unreal how off one deal to sell souls
And he got 'em by the dozen
Medulla oblongata is what got them by the oven
Like how the moonshine is what got him by the cousin
He got her by the bottom and he 'bout to stick his tongue in
Such an unsettling scene
An obscene setting for the unwedding of rings
The sharpest dresser at the unheading of queens
The architecture is something you've never seen
Dream clean, that's three words at the same time
And killed three birds with the same--
And won each and every hand with the same bluff and
Answers each and every man with the same question
What is it? But you still wanna know but I already done did it
I ball heavy, the physics
It's all, but it's already specific
If we doing what's already done, that means it's already terrific
That's rather meta-poetic, and just to acknowledge that
As an extra exhibit to what's already within it
The galleries lack the wall space
So I made a gallery of galleries, made of all space
If it was more small, it would be Moore's Law
From the land of the po' where we war, saw
From the hand of a pro to a whore jaw
Make her stand at the store 'til the snow thaw
Went from paper boy to editor
From throwing Ars Poetica with the arms of Federer
On the porches and steps to the farm houses of settlers
One of several sects who can come and charm the predators
We who measure the measuring tools of measurers
We who pleasure the pleasure tubes of pleasurers
We who lecture at treasured schools of lecturers
We who question the treasured rules of leveragers
Born to death, born to die
Mourn correct: immortalize
In a war, where your performance score is your salary
It's like fantasies combating your mortality
I'm just trying to restore sanity
Sigmund Freud boy, Leroy to your Vanity
To instill what kills krill destroys manatee
So heels spill but still seal deals that build factories
What looks Roman senator inner reveals Maccabees
Never just trust off guts, but what's actually
Unless it's Kuato's
Now, we back to pillars of salt, I recall back peeling potatoes
In hindsight, maybe attack of killer tomatoes
A seasoned shoulder's carrying plenty Pentium payloads
Now, that's another strata but I was making sense
Then cop out, took the highway and I was making chips
A nappy-head Karate Kid, I was breaking bricks
Can fight like Tekken 5, even taking 6
This rehabilitation, I be taking trips
"Don't Ruin Us" God said, I won't make a dent
Hardly, but I'm still Harvey, I hope this making sense
Devil tooting his own horn, don't come and take a sniff
In the streets you gotta fight, you get punished for taking whiffs
To make that change for your team, you gotta have New Jersey Drive and a stomach for taking whips
I'm just trying to redeem
With these hands full of bars, don't beat me for coming clean
To unify the hooks, if you know it, then come and sing
Don't bust in while I'm asleep, nightmares who come in dreams
Samurais rarely die from another sword
This is 1985 meets the hover board
That was Bobby Johnson potato, just to underscore
Think deep, but don't let it fry your motherboards
Diptych, so now them paintings plural, but this is Jr's Mural

[Intro: Timbaland]
The 90's paid it, the 90's

[Verse 1: Aaliyah]
Hey there, you nasty boy, it's been a minute (minute)
And I could say my life has changed, since you hit it, (hit it)
This is your strongest trait, you work the middle (baby)
While they say I'm sprung, I'll say, maybe a little

[Chorus: Aaliyah (Timbaland)]
Keeps me shakin'
(I keep you shakin')
He keeps me shakin'
(Keep you shakin')
Your love makin'
(My love makin')
It keeps me shakin'
(I keep you shakin')
Got me chasin'
(G-g-got it, got it, got it)
He must be taken
(You know, you know)
I ain't hatin'
(I ain't hatin')
Cause I like shakin'
(I like shakin')

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
I like movin' to the little bit (to the little bit girl)
I like getting to the middle baby (middle)
Oh, can you see me coming? ( do you see me coming?)
I don't want you to see me coming (hey)
I want to be up on the sneak attack (wooo)
Cause I want to hit it from the back (ohh)
Baby I like shakin', (shakin') ooh, baby I got you shakin'

[Chorus: Aaliyah (Timbaland)]
Keeps me shakin'
(I keep you shakin')
He keeps me shakin'
(Keep you shakin')
Your love makin'
(My love makin')
It keeps me shakin'
(I keep you shakin')
Got me chasin'
(G-g-got it, got it, got it)
He must be taken
(You know, you know)
I ain't hatin'
(I ain't hatin')
Cause I like shakin'
(I like shakin')

[Verse 3: Strado]
She said they all just the same when she loving them
I'm Mcnabbin, out of pocket, I'm so Donovan
The quick fix to all her broken promises
I'm 7-11 in that thing, thank you come again
That's All night, all pipe, she alright
I hit it once, she called twice, that's called life
That hotline bling'n off how I sling it
She telling all her homegirls 'bout it, it ain't no secret
It's Hard to shake it off when I keep you shakin' baby
That On-demand, pay per view, where your patience baby?
Go Rowdy Rod Piper when I just pipe her
I kinda like her so it's a must that I change her life up

[Chorus: Aaliyah (Timbaland)]
Keeps me shakin'
(I keep you shakin')
He keeps me shakin'
(Keep you shakin')
Your love makin'
(My love makin')
It keeps me shakin'
(I keep you shakin')
Got me chasin'
(G-g-got it, got it, got it)
He must be taken
(You know, you know)
I ain't hatin'
(I ain't hatin')
Cause I like shakin'
(I like shakin')
Keeps me shakin'
(I keep you shakin')
He keeps me shakin'
(Keep you shakin')
Your love makin'
(My love makin')
It keeps me shakin'
(I keep you shakin')
Got me chasin'
(G-g-got it, got it, got it)
He must be taken
(You know, you know)
I ain't hatin'
(I ain't hatin')
Cause I like shakin'
(I like shakin')

[Intro]
You know I'm tuned in with the best from the 213
This is DJ LOS
This is Long Beach moving Y'all
Get ready, get ready, get ready
Turn up

[Hook]
Nigga when we ride on them haters
Nigga when we slide, motivation
If you wanna find me, come to Long Beach
213 is where I be at

[Verse 1]
Beach city, beach city, that's my claim to fame
Reminiscing, while I'm twisting, standing in the rain
I'm in the mixing game, all my joints get fit to pain
And I gripped the cane and I gripped the grain
And I only came to spit the game
Straight up out that Long Beach to Strong Beach
Sneak baby in the party with that long heat
At the wrong beach to play with
Stay with that mossburg, that AK
That chop-chop that whoop-whoop
That's spray day, that's mayday
Now Snoop do what he want to
I will do and I won't do
Slide up, ride up, fired up when I dump two
Now all it takes is one line but thanks to it flipped out
Long Beach, east side, yes sir we cripped out

[Hook]
So Nigga when we ride on them haters
Nigga when we slide, motivation
If you wanna find me, come to Long Beach
213 is where I be, off of Long beach
213 is where I be, off of Long beach
If you wanna find me, nigga come to Long Beach

[Verse 2]
Classics, ain't giving out no passes
Get low or get gone you gonna end up getting blasted
So plastic it's drastic, but I'mma keep doing my part
I was raised up on the east side, born and bred at king park
After dark, no hooks, no marks, all G's
Dipped through the funk out and I graduated with all Cs
Sold dope and I made bread, never switch and that's real shit
Stay down from the playground and I always represent 20 crip
I'm so cool, old school when I paint pictures like Shoku
Ask anybody not just the homies, Snoop Dogg he been a fool
I really do I got heart and I got smart
Bad part, don't panic I'm on Atlantic
And yep, yep I got the Cannon

[Hook]
So nigga when we ride on them haters
Nigga when we slide, motivation
If you wanna find me, come to Long Beach
213 is where I be, bitch off of Long beach
So nigga when we ride on them haters
Nigga when we slide, motivation
If you wanna find me, come to Long Beach
213 is where I be, off of Long beach

I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 2: blackbear]
Yeah, yeah-eah-eah

I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes (Ocean eyes)
No fair (No fair, no fair)
You really know how to make me cry (Know how to make me cry)
When you give me those ocean eyes (Those ocean eyes)
I'm scared (I'm scared)
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes

[Outro: Billie Eilish]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Lace skull that once hung low
On its humble throne awoke
Arouse
Lace skull that once hung low
On its humble throne awoke
A rose

Said did the scroll so salty diamonds
The day it truly roll on
And filled up the well you never could tell
Who threw the first stone
They sat and pawed a moment at the ocean's velvet
I've died and gone to heaven
First only for a second
They sat and pawed a moment at the ocean's velvet
I've died and gone to heaven
And swung softly as a feather
Swung softly as a feather

You have come here wounded, pawed
Seeking courage, solace
I found a way to the faucet's source
I found a way to the faucet's source
I'll breathe you a message in condensation
Written in your glass heart
If only you'd illuminate it for a moment
The sky weeps veins and ink for all who listen in
Trickle to your glass heart
If only you'd illuminate it for a moment

Lace skull that once hung low
On its humble throne awoke
A rose
Lace skull that once hung low
On its humble throne awoke
Arouse
Awoke a rose

[Verse]
And I just went cold turkey on my bitch
It's a cold world, been servin' niggas since-
No Mercy, just lurkin' by the fence
Ed Murphy Raw, Persian floor, pigs in the fog
Dogs comin' to search the car, that's ironic 'cause
Every verse just serve the purpose of a service dog
To these blind niggas, redefine what you heard before
How every word got the urgency of nurses
On the tele with the surgeon, had a belly full of bourbon
'Til I remembered I'm worth it, still exempt from the curses
Still a couple shoulders over y'all
And life's short but the totem tall
I told you that the flow would circle, bring it back
I get inertia, then I murk it all
What's the topic of conversation? What's the protocol?
I keep my toe from out the serpent's jaw
Listen, I don't know who hurt you Ma
What I know is livin' in the past just hurt you more
And now I'm grown, I'm tryna bag 'em like the grocery store
A lot of niggas poultry, I see chicken and I roast it all
A nigga livin' in the moment, no remarks, just a question
"Why you lookin' for some innocence you know you lost?"
Engine runnin', pistons spittin' like it's motocross
Should the sunset, got the city golden
Plus my son said, I'm the city golden boy
I've pissed and spit on my opponent
Then I'm pitchin' bodies overboard
And then I'm shakin' off them shackles
I be in the house sometimes, I own my masters
Catch me on the couch unwindin'
If she throw the cat, I'll smash it out the linen
Off a pack that my Uncle Al provide me
Eyes on low rider, back to business man
They low-fi so don't mind 'em
Farm 'em for they cheese, not they co-sign
And knock 'em out they motherfuckin' socks when you clothes-line 'em
Not tryna change the game, don't sign him
Motherfucker

[Verse]
And this morning felt peculiar when I get up
Different nigga in the mirror, had to size up
Brooded with the blinds up
This block quiet 'round the corner where they robbing
I promise you though it's all here
The falls and the rise and the dark and the light
Be the truth where you find it, success is options
Stress get awful
If that nigga over seven then I bet he watching Sweaty often
Cause my water calm and deep
Y'all still creeks gon' dry up eventually
Still not gon' miss 'em and that thought just tickled me pink
Think I must of lost a piece of my lung to the sink
You know you can't run from no repercussions
Can't run when the reaper lift up his sleeves
And then brush it
It's bleak in the bubble that most my peoples grew up in
Can't run from the street
Designed to mislead and corrupt ya
I said it before, my head in the sky
My feet in the struggle
Tryna' keep peace on my mind
But recently, swear the scuffle been heated with mine
Swear if my voice of reason only beat up my pride
Like half the time that I needed it
It feeling like I'm the only one I'm cheating with
Creep up my spine
My nigga fronting like these substances
That weaken my drive
Crack phone full of bitches
Tryna' eat up my time
Stop snitching motherfucker, keep ya leash on ya dimes
Stop dropping 'em, bitch ass nigga

[Verse]
Started out tryna make a truce
Ended up back in mine off a 80 proof
But running wild got you thinking you could solve it
We could really use some time
Just to recollect and find out a thing or two
Check the weather, never mind I ain't in the mood
Eyes settled on the prize bitch, I'm in the loop
Strip vinyl, spliff fired up, I get to choose
Which titles my rivals could win or lose
Parachuting through the fall, I wish for summer off
Spring fitted for the dark, nigga in the long-sleeve
Driftin' through it all, niggas know
Niggas know not to hit me, I don't get too many calls
This city shit go, pity how a piggy did you dog
That’s why swampman living in the bog, feeling like a tsar
Off-brand niggas on the spittle getting charred
Swear you can hear death whistle from afar
When the wind blow, feds want your info
Streets full of sink holes, sheets full of nymphos
Brains like a baseball, legs like some pencils
Head for the hills, cause I'm on your heels
Like a bloodhound trained to your scent
Show face when I get dough, my face in the shit
Two cards, blackjack, both ace's, it's lit
Cold case on the mess that I made thugging
No trace of me since, I sin, no place to repent
Close game but we win, motherfucker
Closed game, cold game

[Verse]
My nigga say he miss them older days
But I ain't known to break or fold the shape
I know the stakes and I know my place
I mow the grass so I know the snakes out for cash
I'm just watching rats while they watching cheese
And I watch the hogs while they watching me
I'm watching rats while they watching cheese
And watch the hogs while they watching me
Don't fucking talk to me, please don't fucking talk to me, dog
It's not space between this rock and this hard place
I be caught between all day, I hear foot steps in the hallway
I hear sleep's cousin at arm's length, I don't sleep
It's no sheep for me to count in the farm land, but dro cheap
Turned 21 and said peace to my bo-peep
But my flow still on stove heat, stroll through the old street
Stoned, crack a cold one for my dead and gone ones
Got strong lungs, might mug but it's all love
Nigga lost weight, so I use both paws when I grub
Cross state for the fucking check, like a old nigga prostate
Run it up, moms think I'm ducking her, I got a girl, half the time
I just think I'm falling out of love with her, it's fucked up
Other half the time, hammer time, I'm tryna fuck something
Nothin' to discuss, you could trust
I won't pick up, tryna hit me 'bout a plus one
Stomach full off of eating other niggas' lunch up
Stuck in the middle of the wolves and they issues
Everybody got they fronts up
Run some credentials like you're Forrest Gump

[Refrain]
It's a stick up, don't get punched up my nigga
When they jump out the pick up don't get jumped
It's a stick up, don't get punched up my nigga
When they jump out the -

[Outro]
I don't front, cause I front-line, not the dumb kind neither
I don't like people, still ducking one time cause I like reefer
The shroom make my eye tear up
The truth makes my sky clear up
The shroom make my eye tear up
The truth makes my sky clear up
(We just... we just here, talkin' shit. Asher! You owe me a rhyme!)
Asher: I owe you a rhyme?
(The last time we talked...)
Asher: Alright man, turn it up, man. Turn it up. Yo
(Yo, Cudi, you wanna get in on this?)
Cudi: Yeah, It's whatever, man

Asher: I think I got somethin' special for you, too
(You want me to introduce you?)
Asher: Cause you know, Cudi and I, we go all over the place We, we.... we cross over. We don't like to... We like to go all... We walked in on some foreign talk
(Alright! Hahaha. Let's go!)
Cudi: Let's go
Asher: My shit is like this when people walk in

We do this, we do that, we do rock, we do rap
We do jazz we do funk and then classical
With a clash to Outkast, back to Johnny Cash
Flash from Black Thought and A Tribe Called Quest
Les from Primus, Mos Def and Kweli
Zepplin, Onyx, Beck, and Chuck D
Feelin' of Bob Dylan, hints of John Lennon
Mixed with a bit of Pimp C and Bun B (Woah!)
Marley in my heart with parts of Charlie Parker
Mozart's art and all of Shawn Carter
Bjork to Tom York, Europe to New York
Morrison of The Doors, and Morsel of Too Short.(hey!)
In short this list is long and just goes on, y'all
Me and Cudi, we unstoppable!
Cudi:
Yeah, I be freshman, next in
Kickin' up the dirt and they be blessed then
When you come arrest him, we'll be out, in minutes
I don't give a fuck what bail-bondsman are spittin'
I'mma let y'all niggas know they well wishin'
Kid Cudi fall off? Never bossy, I'm getting money
Bounce all around the world; similar to bunny
Rabbit, you want my dick? Come grab it
I will break skull, motherfucker
Kid Cudi's in the mall poppin' tags and I'm duckin' 'em
Everytime they try to play the games, all the model girls claim
That they runnin' round town and they fuckin' him
No, they ain't fuckin' with him, no, not on that level
I never love the hoes, cause a nigga got several
I'm not tryna be caught up, like I'm
In this, movie that you, know
I'm not tryna be up in court
Baggin' all these hoes, no nigga
I am just trying to sit back and smoke my kush
You want doobie? No, what you know is hit the puss
You wish you weird, nigga, my nigga, Asher Roth
We the motherfucking bossiest of boss
What you know about that, boy, yes the ball I will toss

Asher:
Yeah, and this is it, down to this
To the nitty gritty, my finger nails as dirty as any, but anyway
We slice it, it's goin' against me, fightin' to show 

[?]
I'm tryin', but no one lets me I'm tired, so don't upset me
Cause I'm, tryna fight with both arms tied behind me
With a blindfold on, throwin' shots at my body, but I
Continue on like I carried the cross
Stroll past the crossroads to the land of the lost
And then, skip right to Satan, throw some penny's at his feet
Say I'd give him my soul, but I sold it to the industry, so
Not up to me, attached a couple of strings
And before decisions made I'm in different directions
It's nothin' but reps and, record execs and
You and the next man go get your investments, cause
Now more than ever, I'm hot with hostility
It's now or never and never's never a possibility
Cudi:
If you'd listened to Day'N'Nite in reverse
You'd probably think I was suicidal, with the knife in the bible
I don't give a fuck with niggas sittin' back and so idle
I'm that nigga, I'm you'r father, get in your room and study
I'm that nigga in the back, you can call me your buddy
Cause I'm rollin' up the weed, so we can smoke the next plenty
Hey, so talk records homie
We do it bigger than you ever could imagine
I'm something like Big Pun and Biggie Smalls
Combined, but on half paid
I let these niggas know I dry heave
When I spit the heat, motherfuckers better bundle up, air tight
I be in the club all day through the midnight
You could get it spit right, yeah
I'm tryna let these motherfoes somethin wrong in here
There's somethin' wrong up in my brain
I'm not the same as everyone else
Niggas know the flow is the best in the elf
And stealth, Metal Gear Solid
Move when I'm runnin' in the game, can't stop him
Asthma, nigga Asher Roth and Hamilton
We put the game over and we gon' win
They losin' the game if we choosin'
We off and playin' beer pong all day we boozin'
We choosin' the nice hoes, we tryna get it poppin' after every show
Asher:
I want to admit that I have a track for you
It's called "She Don't Want A Man"
I think you would... rap to
But I don't mean rap to, I need you on the hook
Shit, I hate to go outside the book, but look
I stole someone's Poland Springs, didn't mean to
I think it was yours and all, but shit, I'm just drinkin' to
Try to stay hyrdrated, you know all day
Hydroplane when I make my way to NY-hey-C
See me on MTV soon, but please, no drama to you
When I was in the Woodies, with the cool kids
We was chillin, I was in the same fuckin' Sperry's as these
Please, can't see me gettin' fuckin' cheese
But hey, in my pockets, these the same dirty jeans
I work for three weeks, same fuckin' jeans, same K-mart tee
I mean this is a K-mart sweatshirt that I haven't washed in two weeks, but fuck it, I'm fuckin' dirty as shit
But now it's off the top talkin' bout nonsense
I don't care cause it's all ral- relevant, hell of it
(Cudi starts hook)
Hell of this, fear this MC shit
So Cudi gonna give me a hook right here
There, for your ears
(Cudi restarts hook)
Crystal clear, it's enough, this is enough
So what, I don't give a fuck, where's my man Snuff at?
Snuffaluffagus, from Sesame Street, deep, you can't see me
I'm like The Beets and Doug Funnie
"The Killer Tofu" is oh who?
Who? Asher Roth, motherfucker, and now you knew

Cudi:

[Hook]
Hear them callin', me
And I ain't playin' no more
Say, oh I hear 'em callin', me
And I ain't playin' no more, hey
Now I will show you what's in store
Nigga further more, I'm that young boy out in the game, hey
And I can hear 'em callin'
And I can hear 'em callin'



Asher: There you go. You got -- You just got a whole song!
(I love it. I love it. I love it. Where's the applause? 

[cheering] That's what it is, baby. Peace out radio.)
Cudi: That hook was off the dome
Asher: Yeah, we love you enough
(Wait, was that really off the dome right there?)
Asher: That was love right there
Cudi: That hook was off the dome
Asher: That was love right there
(You guys are good people, man. I like to have real talk with you guys.)
Asher: But for real, yo, I came here because I was like, yo, let's do it

[Chorus]
Memories, precious memories
Memories, precious memories
Memories, precious memories
Memories, precious memories

[Verse 1]
I recall a time as we used to sit for hours
Holding hands, I used to buy you flowers
With our hearts together
Nothing mattered
I remember dreams I had and plans we made
Oh I'd grow in love girl to cascade
Oh but the dreams are all shattered

[Pre-Chorus]
What can I do now that your love has left my life
My dreams are cut to shreds by jealous, hateful lies
The knife was made of lies and schemes that we knew so well
To turn our glowing love into a cold and empty shell

[Chorus]
Leaving me with memories, girl, and harmony
Memories, oh, how love ought to be
Oh, precious memories
Ooh baby, precious memories

[Verse 2]
I was a fool, I know
Honey and don't it show?
It can't help but shine
Here is a grown man crying
Mixed up in confusion
So badly disillusioned
This precious love I've had
Slipped away so fast

[Pre-Chorus]
Now the plan is gone and there's a reasonable substitute
I just saw myself crying, it didn't look too cute
I found a single blood you dropped and you hate to part
I used it to press my tears and held it to my heart

[Chorus]
It brought back memories
Reminding me how love used to be
Memories, precious memories
Memories, precious memories
Memories, precious memories
Memories, precious memories

[Verse 1]
Here I stand lonely, just a heartbroken guy
I used to be a laugher, 'till I made my baby cry
And I knew my baby loved me, I was overconfident
So I did her wrong, now she's gone, I don't know which way she went

[Chorus]
My baby forgave me so much time and time and time again
Cause when your baby starts to walk away
And tells you no need to follow
And nothing you do, seems to make her stay
It's a bitter pill to have to swallow

[Verse 2]
But the way the ball bounces, that's the way the cookie crumbles
From the top to the bottom, that's a long way to tumble
Oh when you realize that you're no longer first on your baby's list
And the home you thought you had forever no longer exists

[Chorus]
You wake up and you discover what a great fool you have been
Cause when your baby starts to walk away
And tells you no need to follow
And nothing you do, seems to make her stay
It's a bitter pill to have to swallow

[Bridge]
Ooh baby, what kind of fool am I?
To know that you love me and yet I made you cry
Baby when I think it over
It's fault that I'm here, gone, but I'd like to do it over
And would deliver my love to you warm
And on and on

[Chorus]
Oh darling you forgave me so much time and time and time again
Cause when your baby starts to walk away
And tells you no need to follow
And nothing you do, seems to make her stay
It's a bitter pill to have to swallow
Cause when your baby starts to walk away
And tells you no need to follow
And nothing you do, seems to make her stay
It's a bitter pill to have to swallow

[Chorus]
Ooh it's more than a heart can stand
It's more than a heart can stand, yes it is

[Verse 1]
Oh my days were dark as night but the sunshine of your love
Baby, baby, brought light to me
I was lost, oh hopeless though
But like a blessing from above, you gave new life to me
Ooh now you say you're leaving
You say you're taking my sunshine away
Oh I can see the loneliness closing in on me

[Chorus]
Ooh and it's more than a heart can stand
It's more than a heart can stand, yes it is
Losing you is more than a heart can stand, yes it is, yes it is
More than a heart can stand, yes it is

[Verse 2]
If I thought that crying would change your mind
Ooh baby, don't you know I'd cry a million tears
If I thought that lying would persuade you not to leave me
Ooh baby, oh I'd lie for a million years
Can't we talk it over, can't we make amends
Please don't lock me up in loneliness again

[Chorus]
Ooh it's more than a heart can stand
Oh it's more than a heart can stand, yes it is
Losing you is more than a heart can stand, yes it is, yes it is
More than a heart can stand, yes it is

[Verse 3]
Oh now that you've brought me out of loneliness
Oh please, baby please, don't take my happiness
You know that I love you, no matter what you do
But what would I do without you?

[Chorus]
It's more than a heart can stand
Oh it's more than a heart can stand, yes it is
Losing you is more than a heart can stand, yes it is, yes it is
It's more than a heart can stand, yes it is

[Verse 1]
I smile through the night
No matter what the people like
Cause my mind doesn't mind
Just dancing in the city lights

[Pre-Chorus]
No I don't mind being special
Isn't that what we all want?
Here's to all my lonely dancers
Go ahead and make it all yours

[Chorus]
My lonely dancers, all my lonely dancers
My lonely dancers, this your song
Just keep on dancing, oh just keep on dancing
You won't be lonely for long
My lonely dancers, all my lonely dancers
My lonely dancers, this your song
Just keep on dancing, oh just keep on dancing
You won't be lonely for long

[Verse 2]
Tonight, feel alright
Still dancing in the city lights
Tonight's just about
Why shouldn't I just cross the line

[Pre-Chorus]
No I don't mind being special
Isn't that what we all want?
Here's to all my lonely dancers
Just know that you're not alone

[Chorus]
My lonely dancers, all my lonely dancers
My lonely dancers, this your song
Just keep on dancing, oh just keep on dancing
You won't be lonely for long
My lonely dancers, all my lonely dancers
My lonely dancers, this your song
Just keep on dancing, oh just keep on dancing
You won't be lonely for long

My lonely dancers, all my lonely dancers
My lonely dancers, this your song
Just keep on dancing, oh just keep on dancing
You won't be lonely for long
My lonely dancers, all my lonely dancers
My lonely dancers, this your song
Just keep on dancing, oh just keep on dancing
You won't be lonely for long

[Outro]
Just keep on dancing
You won't be lonely for long, for long
Just keep on dancing
You won't be lonely for long, for long

[Verse 1]
Don't fall for me, I won't fall for you
I bruise easily, it takes too long to recover
When you're broken, nothing even matters
And when you're shattered, it's hard to find the pieces scattered

[Chorus]
Why, oh, why?
Must it be so complicated?
Why, oh, why?
Can we stand in love?
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Can we stand in love?

[Refrain]
Don't fall for me, I won't fall for you
I bruise easily, it takes too long to recover

[Chorus]
Why, oh, why?
Must it be so complicated?
Why, oh, why?
Can we stand in love?
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Can we stand in love?
Can we stand in love?

[Verse 3]
Oh, don't fall for me, nah, I won't fall for you
I bruise easily, it takes too long to recover
I'm lonely, heart broken, you're not wrapped up in my arms tonight
Don't leave, no I,  it takes too long to recover

[Chorus]
Why, oh, why?
Must it be so complicated?
Why, oh, why?
Can we stand in love?
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Can we stand in love?
Can we stand in love?

[Intro]
Fa lalalala

[Verse 1]
This is my sad Christmas song
I've had it stuck in my head all day long
I wrote it in the car on my ride home
Cause I knew I'd walk in the door and I'd be alone
Why'd I even put up that fuckin' tree?
If there's no one here that's gonna see
Just how pretty she looks on Christmas Eve
Cause there's no one here next to me

[Chorus 1]
This is my sad Christmas song
So I light another bong
I turn on the radio
I binge watch our favorite shows
This year feels kind of lame
But the last one was the same
"Where's your holiday spirit?" they say
It's taking off on a plane
This is my sad Christmas song
Fa lalalala

[Verse 2]
I always thought that Santa was kind of cute
There's something about his beard, big belly, and boots
I left Santa more than cookies this year
I thought he might appreciate a few beers
That's why I'm always on the naughty list
He said cause when I get drunk, I'm always showing my tits
He leaned in for a kiss and he got real near
I had to stop Santa and say "My true love ain't here"

[Chorus 2]
This is my sad Christmas song
So I rip another bong
I never been good at making plans
Next year, I'm gonna be with my man
My little sister says I'm the Grinch
But my mom thinks I'm just a bitch
Why did you have to go?
We were under the mistletoe
This is my sad Christmas song
Fa lalalala
Fa lalala

[Bridge: Fa lalala in background]
Missing you on fuckin' Christmas
Why did you have to go?
Wishing you a Merry Christmas
Know I miss you so
Missing you on fuckin' Christmas
Why did you have to go?
Wishing you a Merry Christmas
Know I miss you so

[Outro]
Wishing you a Merry Christmas
(Fa lalalala
Fa lalalala)
Wishing you a Merry Christmas
(Fa lalalala
Fa lalalala)
Wishing you a Merry Christmas
(Fa lalalala
Fa lalalala)
Wishing you a Merry Christmas
(Fa lalalala)

[Verse 1]
Christmas will break your heart
If your world is feeling small
There's no one on the phone
You feel close enough to call
Christmas will crush your soul
Like that laid back rock 'n' roll
But your body's getting old
It's much too tired to be so bold
Christmas can wreck your head
Like some listless awkward sex
So you refuse to leave your bed
Get depressed when no one checks
Yeah, Christmas will break your heart
Like the armies of the unrelenting dark
Once the peace talks fall apart

[Chorus]
But still I'm coming home to you

[Verse 2]
Christmas will shove you down
So just lay back in the snow
That quiet wind won't wake
What inside you has grown cold
And Christmas will drown your love
Like a storm down from above
On your fading memories of a normal life
Oh, while I thought to make you mine
Believing in the line
That your heart would melt with time
And though you're out with them again
Your thick and fickle friends
They might replace the love that ends

[Chorus]
But still I'm coming home to you
To you
To you
To you
Yes you
To you
To you
To you

[Bridge]
What if you're done?
What if you don't want it anymore?
So what if they're gone?
So what if they don't love you anymore?

[Outro]
I'm coming home
Can you see me?
Can you still see me?
Hey mama, take my hand!

My problems get fewer fewer
My diamonds look bluer bluer
You know how do this shit
Sip champagne in the cockpit
Louis V my outfit
I like it, then I buy it
Just like a vegan, I hate pigs
In the Limo, bumping Misfits
Your boyfriend, he's a counterfeit
Every night, is prom night bitch
SBE in this bitch
It's Leandoer, and Lean do it

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
She say she wanna have some fun to night
Well I'ma smash her like it prom night
We in the limo  like it prom night
Sippin' champagne like it prom night
She say she wanna have some fun to night
So I'ma smash her like the prom night
We in the limo like it's prom night
Sippin' champagne like it's prom night
Prom Night
Ha

[Verse 1]
The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You say my name for the first time, baby
And I fall in love in an empty bar
And you stood there in front of me just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinking of

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Verse 2]
So reach out open handed and lead me out to that floor
I don't need more paper lanterns
Take me down, baby
Bring on the movie score
'Cause my heart is beating fast and you are beautiful
I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Bridge]
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep your beautiful eyes on me
Gonna strike this match tonight
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
I'd love to hate it, but you make it like a firework show

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Outro]
And the sparks fly
Oh, baby, smile
And the sparks fly

'Bout to flex at Panda Express, diamond, carats, no marriage
Rubies blushing out in Paris, diamonds, carats, no marriage
Rubies blushing out in Paris, I don't do Snapchats
I ain't do Snapchats, I don't do behind the scenes
Walking straight off the plane, to a tint-up limousine
Brick Squad bandannas wrapped around car antennas
Mr. Pound student-faculty, Mr. Brick off a balcony

[Verse 1]
I'm lost, I'm a ghost
Dispossessed, taken host
My hunger burns a bullet hole
A spectre of my mortal soul

[Chorus 1]
These rumors and suspicion
Anger is a poison

[Verse 2]
The only truth that I could see
Is when you put your lips to me
Futures tricked by the past
Spectre, how he laughs

[Chorus 2]
Fear puts a spell on us
Always second-guessing love

[Verse 3]
My hunger burns a bullet hole
A spectre of my mortal soul
The only truth that I can see
Spectre has come for me

[Chorus: Quavo]
Girl, what's your sign? I pull up right on time
"She don't fuck with broke niggas", you sit on the sideline
Back your ass up, whip that booty, and rewind
I just want to see what's in 'em jeans like Ginuwine
What's in 'em jeans? What's in 'em jeans?
Bay, you make that booty bend like trampoline
What's in 'em jeans? What's in 'em jeans?
All my pretty girls scream, "Pretty Gang"

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Broke boys always talking 'bout
How many hoes they fuck, how many bitches they got
But we really wanna know how many coins you got
If you talking 'bout your rap, how many songs you got?
This for my bitches, all my bad bitches
Only if you independent and after your riches
She a old lady got a young nigga in the corner
Young nigga hit it right and smoked that good marijuana
She'll have you in the club mad, everybody want her
I think I like her persona, Victoria's Secret aroma
Late night at the Aroma, I took her home and I bone her
She screwed up in the Corolla, got her drunk of Coronas
Jewelry colder than Polar, I'm high like the Solar
She took it more than Oprah, make it clap like Magnolia
It's the first time you seen her, and she act like she know ya
That's her motive, she burst that wallet open, so I had to ask her

[Chorus: Quavo]
Girl, what's your sign? I pull up right on time
"She don't fuck with broke niggas", you sit on the sideline
Back your ass up, whip that booty, and rewind
I just want to see what's in 'em jeans like Ginuwine
What's in 'em jeans? What's in 'em jeans?
Bay, you make that booty bend like trampoline
What's in 'em jeans? What's in 'em jeans?
All my pretty girls scream, "Pretty Gang"

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
I asked her what's her sign, she told me, "Gemini"
I told her, "Girl, you lying, that's the same sign as mine"
But anyway, never mind, back to the subject, "You fine"
I'm tryna see if  in them jeans Ginuwine
And she don't like broke boys, broke boys ain't making no noise
Walk around with a check like Floyd, she licking at me looking gorgeous
Pinky ring the size of orbit, broke boys can't afford it
Look in my pockets on Orbit, I'm a free man no Morgan
Man, you can go to my mansion, it got six stories
Hop in the Lam' and drop the top like the Headless Horseman
Telling me stories of her and a broke boy divorce
Honestly, I can care less, baby, that ain't important
I like how them jeans look tight, they show your panties
Walking 'round the club got these broke boys panic
When she walk in public, people turn to a mannequin
She done killed the whole club, call the ambulance

[Chorus: Quavo]
Girl, what's your sign? I pull up right on time
"She don't fuck with broke niggas", you sit on the sideline
Back your ass up, whip that booty, and rewind
I just want to see what's in 'em jeans like Ginuwine
What's in 'em jeans? What's in 'em jeans?
Bay, you make that booty bend like trampoline
What's in 'em jeans? What's in 'em jeans?
All my pretty girls scream, "Pretty Gang"

Tell me you're still poppin' on the low
You found you somebody and I know
Tell me you need time all for yourself
Tell me you're still poppin' on the low
'Cause late night, I still drop in on the low
He just took you shoppin', girl, I know
Don't let him buy his way up in it
You know that I can't let no nigga get one up on me, no no
And you know this shit
So how could you give him what you gave to me? No, no
'Cause what I did was wack but you don't get me back like that, girl, no

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
I was all the way in it and my heart was way in it
And now it's hard to stay in it, the pride is all gone
Only reason we fuckin' is 'cause I know that you love him
And back then you let him get one up on me, girl
I know that he just doesn't cut it
Ain't nothin' gon' change you back to the girl I used to fuck with
Can't believe that you done let another nigga get what's mine
Can't believe that you done let another nigga get what's mine

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Tell me you're still poppin' on the low
Girl, you got someone that doesn't know
He can have your sex, I got your soul
Just don't give that to no one else, oh, no
Straight like this, tonight we fuck to my shit, call me up
Because the reason why them niggas just can't hit it right
They wasn't blessed with my dick, straight like that
You can say, ain't gotta lie, girl, no
'Cause when we fuckin', I'm in it
Goin' all the way in it, snappin' my feelings
It ain't my props, just offendin', I'm goin' off girl
For the nights that you fronted
Man, you told me you love him
But how could you love him?
You know when we fuckin', I'm deep in that sea

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
I drop OZs in my blunt, 44 from down the way
It's that nigga, it's that nigga that you know from down the way
Shawty got somebody else but that someone isn't me
Now you want expensive taste, girl, that shit just isn't free
I stay lowed up, I stay rolled up in that thang on the low
Girl, you're different, you don't even act the same way no more
Girl, I know you're movin' on, I don't want you movin' on
Girl, how long have you been gone? What the fuck have you been on?

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
I was all the way in it and my heart was way in it
And now it's hard to stay in it, the pride is all gone
Only reason we fuckin' is 'cause I know that you love him
And back then you let him get one up on me, girl
I know that he just doesn't cut it
Ain't nothin' gon' change you back to the girl I used to fuck with
Can't believe that you done let another nigga get what's mine
Can't believe that you done let another nigga get what's mine

Always want you to prove it
You gon' have to do more than just say it
You gon' have to do less when you do it
Lil' mama you know how I show it
Always want you to prove it
And you know, you know
And you know, in this foreign car whippin' out
And you know, you know
And you know, in this foreign car, let you go
Gots to break it down for you
To let you know, you know the things I'm down for
Ain't going act like you ain't 'bout
My door you know ain’t open, girl, you know I'm down for
Take your time to find you out
Won't hesitate to take the time to waste, no baby
Streamin' out, the foreign out to play
You know it's things it takes
Down on it, yeah
Love it when you spin 'round on it, yeah

She know who the fuck she is

Shawty, I ain't seen you in a cold minute
That shit just made me wonder who's in it
That shit just made me wonder who's gettin' it

Girl, I used to fuck you in Toronto
On the Lakeshore, by the condo
I would give it to you, never for sale
And she from the East, gotta meet at Yorkdale
Shawty, when we meet , gotta fuck for real
Took the TTC just to get to Old Mill
And we used to fuck, girl, it was so trill
You remind me of Monica, you was so real

Sippin' on Patron
In LAC all night, but I ain't lackin' tonight, uh
Now shawty, I'ma take if you don't give it to me
You gon' throw it like you tryna give it to me

Fuck you in the night and take it all through breakfast
I'm a young nigga, I got old money
Need the dough before I walk inside the door, money
Take them heels off, walk inside my door, honey
Start to peel off, peelin' off them clothes for me
I know, I know
Fuckin' bitches off my songs
In the stands at the show
I keep it real, I got love for them all
Hop inside a bus and get this thang poppin'
I got that biggie, but it ain't poppa
Your nigga broke or he a chain swapper
I been poppin' all them niggas since the bottom
Tell a bitch to let me leave wit' a story, nigga
Why you playin'? What I'm sayin', just let Tory get you
Yo' nigga talk, we bust that shot like Robert Horry, nigga
It's hard to spend time on these hoes that can't afford me, nigga
On top of that, I keep the piece because they mans be looking for me, nigga
'Cause I had they ex-bitches in a orgy, nigga
Catch a nigga down Toronto, smokin' OG, nigga
Your bitch is fuckin' 'cause she want to fuck a OG, nigga

And the girls say

I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
'Cause I know how you usually do
When you say everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth
If somebody's there then tell me who

[Intro: DJ Drama & Tory Lanez]

Years in the making, New Toronto
And when I go, they gon' remember me like motherfuckin' Makaveli
You know I've been there in the winter time

It's quite cold outside, let's warm this bitch up
Bandana round my head like I’m Makaveli

[Chorus]
I pull out the Porsche, I jump in the Mazi
Then it's the Wraith again, we'll be rich forever

Then it's the Wraith again, I told them that we could be rich together (Real ones can,t be stopped, Tory lanez)
And when I go they gon' remember me like motherfuckin' Makaveli (DJ Drama)
These niggas thought that I was finished

Bandana round my head like I’m Makaveli
I pull out the Porsche, I jump in the Mazi
Then it's the Wraith again, we'll be rich forever
I pull out the Porsche, I jump in the Mazi
Then it's the Wraith again, I told them that we could be rich together (we tried to tell ya')
I pull out the Porsche, I jump in the Mazi
Then it's the Wraith again
Nigga's left me out for dead, now I'm Makaveli (it's all now)
Reincarnated Makaveli

[Verse 1]
Real money, call the lawyer for the deal money
Way a nigga laughin' to the bank, you would think the checks are lookin' real funny
Know a couple niggas that would kill for me, couple bitches that would steal for me
Nigga's still love me, women still love me 'cause they only get it true and real from me
I'm a full time jaw dropper, pardon nigga, but I give it to 'em
All this Actavis up in the Sprite, this shit was gettin' to it, I was sippin' through it
I was with the ruger, nigga really shootin', puttin' bitches all up in the Bentley coupe
It's Birkin to the, to the, to the, titty too, I rode Aventador like it's a rented coupe
Boy, we the other side when them other guys talkin' down
Talkin' 'bout how we run shit, talkin' 'bout how we shut it down
Came in the with the whole thing of the old thing, roll chain with the SoulTrain
With the white girl, baby, cocaine and you know the name and you know the name
Lord, on God, boy, right now, parked outside, straight black Masi
On God, boy, right now, I own heat, no Pat Riley
Made a million dollars rap tourin', I ain't talkin' no Kyle Lowry
Young nigga like the ten commandments, always got ten thous on me

[Chorus]
I'm Makaveli (hahahaha)
I pull out the Porsche, I jump in the Mazi
Then it's the Wraith again, we'll be rich forever
I pull out the Porsche, I jump in the Mazi

Nigga's left me out for dead, now I'm Makaveli
Reincarnated Makaveli

All I want that pit, shit, hoppin' in it like the governor
Hoppin' in it with the cover, then jump in the whip and the trunk it go dan-da-da-dan-da-da
When I step in, I'm fresh and updated
And my women get fresher, the fragrance
Niggas definitely is the greatest
Barely when I'm faded, pay this in the makin'
Had to talk what the team made me
You be sellin' a dream, ain't it?
When my niggas was starvin', you niggas was out buyin' bitches Celine, ain't it?
We can make it a ting, ain't it
We should make it a ting, ain't it
Yeah we know you a star player, only one on your team with a ring, ain't it huh fuck nigga?
Level legit, tell a sucker nigga settle the bet
You ain't got it, niggas double or dead
Used to have to work a double a day
Now I get up and go up and away
I go up on a plane and go fuck with LA
Fuck what you say, I go dope with the k-k-k-k-k-k-k
Clap that nigga, that nigga got something to say
I started day to day, like fuck what a hater say
I know it hurt them to see my commercial all over the AMAs
Or maybe it killed them to know that we number one up on the Airwaves
I'm careless nigga, I'm fearless
Mama these niggas gon' hear me, Fargo (don't take it personal)

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I go, they gon' remember me like motherfuckin' Makaveli (I mean we've been told you)
These nigga's started I would finish
I came back like I am Makaveli
Bandana around my head like I’m Makaveli

[Chorus]
I pull out the Porsche, I jump in the Mazi
Then it's the Wraith again, we'll be rich forever
I pull out the Porsche, I jump in the Mazi
Then it's the Wraith again, I told them that we could be rich together
I pull out the Porsche, I jump in the Mazi
Then it's the Wraith again
Nigga's left me out for dead, now I'm Makaveli
Reincarnated Makaveli

[Verse]
Thumbin' through this check, I'm 'bout to violate
My swag be fuckin' up the tri-state
I might confront you niggas, nah please
Bitch I move it spicy with that I A (hi daddy)
A nigga pulled up in a i8
Wavin' at you niggas like, "Hi hater"
My bitches love to ball, Sanaa Lathan
This that New Toronto, keep the driver waiting
Yeah, thank the Lord, I'm takin' charge
How can I forget when niggas made a star?
Smokin' in this whip I​ bought for 80 large
I am rich bitch, I could buy 80 cars
Triple goose, I'm feathered in it
My bitches silly, your bitches look whatever in it
Lift up the doors, got me feather weighted
Never say never, but pussy, my shit never endin'
When my momma died, they gave me Halmark's
I told myself, I get a crib as big as Walmart
I spit the days aimin', pointin' like a war dart
Now I spent the day, grace the stage at the ball park
We don't resort to violence, just resorts and islands
Book you nigga's for a show, get you scorched and silenced
Ironically, my keys got a horse and my whip visa Porsche
And I am hoppin' out the doors for stallions
Way before my lifestyle was marvellous
Could crack the code but it's back to that boulevard with us
When it was dark taxi cab will never stop with us
Non stop, four money, four blocks
I juiced and stressed, sellin' for four blocks
Pop found a four in my dresser, phone rock
Now I stressed, the compresser is still oppressive
Got me stuntin' on my exes
Short and sick, spent a couple hundred on my dresser
Said fuck that, left a couple hundred for my dresser
There's a war goin' on outside and we got pressure
So I ride with the strap, no joker, Heath Ledger

[Interlude: DJ Drama]
For Scarborough, Sauga City, Brampton

[Outro: Tory Lanez & DJ Drama]
Thumbin' through the check I'm about to violate (gangsta)
My swag be fuckin' up the tri-state
Shout out to Jane & Finch
I might confront you nigga's, nah please
Bitch, I move it spicy with that I A, hi daddy
My Rexdale niggas
A nigga pulled up in a i8
Wavin' at you niggas like, "Hi hater"
My bitches love to ball, so now I laid it
This that New Toronto, keeper drive away (New Toronto)

[Intro: DJ Drama]

Psychic, yeah, she’ll drop a night shift, yeah

You got a feelin', yeah, droppin' the top on the ceilin', yeah
How can I not when I feel it, yeah? How can you not when you feel the same?

[Chorus]
If you let that ass spend one day with me
You know how this gon' go down when you come over, you know that I'm a freak
Don't you spend one day with me if you ain't 'bout that action
Shawty, if you about that action, show me
Spend one day with me
Are you about it? Spend one day with me

[Outro]
You ain't gotta say too much
From the look in your eyes, I can tell you wanna fuck
You ain't gotta call me your boo
Just as bad as you wanna fuck, I wanna fuck too
You ain't gotta say too much
From the look in your eyes, I can tell you wanna fuck
You ain't gotta call me your boo
Just as bad as you wanna fuck, I want some too

[Intro]
You see, the thing about it is, we used to be them lil' niggas
Now we just them niggas

[Chorus]
All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bendin' off the corner, whippin' out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But I ain't gon' lose when I came from the bottom
Lord knows
Nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows
Nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows
Nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows

[Verse 1]
Niggas can lie but The Lord knows
Guiseppe and diamond, my wardrobe
I hop out the leer with my diamonds and cutlasses
My new resolution is stay the fuck away from fuck niggas
Ain't even drivin' 'em back
She come with the team, then she's stuck with us
I might buy a foreign
I'm thinkin' the plate should say, "Nigga Keep Up With Us"
Niggas gon' hate but they know I'm big homie
Ain't gotta know nothin' to know that it's somethin'
Now droppin' the bass when they see the big homie, drop it
I'm flooded, they with it, bitch you can bet it for sure

[Chorus]
All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bendin' off the corner, whippin' out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But I ain't gon' lose when I came from the bottom
Lord knows
Nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows
Nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows
Nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows

[Verse 2]
I walk in the bank and the teller call me Mr. Peterson
The diamonds all up in my Rollie, tell her we gon' meet again
Any time that my baby catch me with a chick I say, "She a friend"
Ironic, I came to the club and my jacket was cheetah skin
All of the real niggas come from Toronto
Niggas'll send you away
Goin' OT to kill you, then come back tomorrow
Woah, this a dirty game in here
He'll be a dead man walkin'
If he ever wear 30 chains in here
I ain't talkin' 'bout French Montana
Have to worry 'bout everything in there
Man niggas tryna take my soul
Pray the Lord that I make my dough
What it's lookin' like?
Pull up in all the big bodies
My whips are nothin' but exotics
My bitches all got the body
I got the Four in the party
Ara, don't make me call my nigga Karo
Ara, my Armenians fly from Fargo, woah

[Interlude]
Look nigga, I don't know what the fuck they told you. This Fargo shit for real. I don't play no games, they been hatin' on me since I was 'bout 8, nigga, shinin'. Designer this, designer that. Hoes see me, niggas jealous, bitches pissed. I ain't this, I ain't that. Shit, y'all niggas just mad I do my motherfuckin' thing and I'm beautiful when I do it, nigga. Ayo Bri, tell these niggas I'm the Balenciaga Bastard, nigga, shinin' with Giuseppes, every color Margielas like Starburst, nigga. I'm done. Fargo

[Chorus]
All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bendin' off the corner, whippin' out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But I ain't gon' lose when I came from the bottom
Lord knows
Nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows
Nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows
Nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows

[Verse 1]
Walks in the room and she side eyes like she’s bad for me
Bad for me and you look so good
Pick up your phone, I'm waitin' outside on my lone
Let me inside so I can take this where he won’t
I know it hurts your mind
That he’s not worth your time
It’s okay, I’m first in line
Shawty, I got that where you need that
Normally, I don’t catch feelings but I got some feelings for you
Droppin' the ceilin' for you
Know that this coupe was made for two

[Chorus]
Worst thing about it is I know that you could find someone better
I could do you better than your nigga and your man and all of your exes
Fuckin' on the weekends, weekends turn to forever
The worst thing, shawty, I'm good for you but you deserve better
Sometimes, I love you but I can do better
Make love and I fuck you but I can do better
I'm caught in the streets with that brand new Beretta
Shawty, I'm good for you but you deserve better

[Verse 2]
Walks in the room with that give no fuck attitude, girl I love it
I'm playin' cool but I'm thinkin' that you look so good
I know what I want, top floor at the Viceroy
You're down, girl, and I know
And you know, no you don’t
No you ain’t gotta lie-da-da-da
Pull up on you tryna ride-da-da-da
Top down on the side-da-da-da
I want you to want me how I want you
And I know that you got it in you
From all of those times that I had to call in
I bring her that good to her one more time

[Chorus]
Worst thing about it is I know that you could find someone better
I could do you better than your nigga and your man and all of your exes
Fuckin' on the weekends, weekends turn to forever
The worst thing, shawty, I'm good for you but you deserve better
Sometimes, I love you but I can do better
Make love and I fuck you but I can do better
I'm caught in the streets with that brand new Beretta
Shawty, I'm good for you but you deserve better

[Intro: Tory Lanez & DJ Drama]
Yeah, new you
New Toronto
New Toronto
Tory Lanez and like that, we gone

[Verse: Tory Lanez]
Shot one of my closest niggas over nothin'
Overheard discussions, niggas talk about it
Tryna be the greatest, sell a billion records
Standin' right with God is the best way of goin' 'bout it
Think it’s time I take this time to give them blessings
Niggas stressin'
Niggas can't see the situation they gettin' blessed in
Came a ways from, robbin' niggas with them Smith and Wessons
Gotta understand, shows sellin' out, hoes yellin' out
Far from my coke shootin', dope sellin' routes
I kicked it with niggas it was no tellin' 'bout
Some Armenian thugs that blow melons out
I used to play the corner while niggas was playin' on it
I had to stay informed and study, just playin' dormant
Back when I was tryin' to set the play up with Jay and Lawrence
I knew I was 'bout to be major
But fuck it, that’s just a page in the booklet
He’s just a name in the story
You gotta pay your respects, I had to pay it in glory
I would play the block slow 'til the corner block corner shop closed
And play the slots in the winter until I'm snot nosed
Abandoned bastard, I was stranded
I guess that was the cards that I was handed
Sleepin' in the back of broken vans and lands
With both hands inside my lane, yeah nigga, that's just where I landed
Campin' out was always standin' out
I was that nigga that done branched out
I was that nigga so I've spoken 'bout
The brand that these niggas that got focused, they had they hands out

[Intro]
I got *NSYNC dancing on my neck
And these Cubans cost a motherfucking check
Got boy bands like I'm Lance Bass
So pretty lil momma come away
(Come my way, come my way, come my way)
Baby bye bye bye
Baby bye bye bye
I got *NSYNC dancing on my neck
And these Cubans cost a motherfucking check
Got boy bands like I'm Lance Bass
Pretty lil momma come my way
(Come my way, come my way, come my way)

[Chorus]
I got *NSYNC dancing on my neck
And these Cubans cost a motherfucking check
Got boy bands like I'm Lance Bass
Pretty lil momma come my way
I got N'Sync dancing on my neck
And these Cubans cost a motherfucking check
Got boy bands like I'm Lance Bass
Pretty lil momma come my way

[Verse]
Ayy
Young motherfucker swing my gold
Everybody act like they know
Everybody want to do the most
I don't do Balmain no more
And tell that motherfucker pour more
I spill ghost blood on my coat
Might rock Moncler when I'm cold
Goddamn that's a whole 'lotta dough
Got them Backstreet Boys, ayy
Lot of chains but I swear I ain't ever change
And I might pull up in a Mercedes
With 16 gold teeth in my face
And you know if I want it, I'ma get it
And if I owe you something, I'ma pay it
If you want to say something, then say it
If you want to try the jewels, make my day

[Chorus]
I got *NSYNC dancing on my neck
And these Cubans cost a motherfucking check
Got boy bands like I'm Lance Bass
So pretty lil momma come my way

[Skit]

You can let your guard down, you came for me

Can I take you down, oh baby?

That boy got shot, I know who didn't do it
That boy got shot, I know who didn't do it
That boy got shot, I know who didn't do it
Slime mob

[Hook: Young Thug]
That boy got shot, I know who didn't do it
That bitch got fucked, I know who didn't do it
Fuck that lil' bitch
He swear all he want, but he didn't do it
He actin' like it, but he didn't do it
He couldn't do it
Didn't do it, he didn't
No he didn't do it
All caps: he ain't do it

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Bitch you didn't do it
Boy you didn't do it, you didn't do it
Bitch I was slime
I sleep in your woods, like Nike, just do it
I'm smokin' on trees
My step is a stomp and my feet on that wood
I am on fire
This ice cools me down so don't play with no fluid
Whip out the bankroll and buy the stilettos
She not gon' do this shit unless I say so
Been a hustler, never been one to kick in a door
He should've known
Put Act on my Eggo then syrup, no Karo
We really rich, nigga, pour 4s in a Faygo
And it's fake though
If she wanna fuck on my bitch, she's a dyke hoe
That right though
Consent for our signatures, we don't do Geico
Alright hoe? Sign your life away for a little plate

[Hook: Young Thug]
That boy got shot, I know who didn't do it
That bitch got fucked, I know who didn't do it
Fuck that lil' bitch
He say what he want, but he didn't do it
He actin' like it, but he didn't do it

All caps: he ain't do it

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I know your worth
You know my work, I go berserk
If she ain't worth
Fuck it, nigga, still buy the lil' purse (cash!)
I see you ballin'
You do it small: Nerf
I throw them bands
Later on best believe she gon' slurp
Chicken pox, gators look like they got chicken pox
I can't flop cause I'm higher than an angel was
Bend her back, eat it, then perform that ankle lock
Niggas can't get the bitch, the girl, they know they crop
First I'm gunnin' then I started runnin'
She flooded me with pussy then I started cummin'
No game, I made that pussy nigga run like Sonic (take off)
When he looked at Pablo Esco then I thought 'bought bummin'

[Hook: Young Thug]
That boy got shot, I know who didn't do it
That bitch got fucked, I know who didn't do it
Fuck that lil' bitch
He say what he want, but he didn't do it

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
'Bout to keep this shit so G, you won't understand
She gon' know some shit 'bout me, you won't understand
I found out that you was creepin' in his Jeep, oh, girl
I read texts in your phone, I know you seeing him, girl
So I did what I did for the night
Had to go, had to get, a couple chicks, get it right
I was wrong
But my flaws and my dogs
Got involved, so I think that it's time
That I say what's on my mind

[Chorus]
I think we both cheated love
And I'm certain we both got it bad
(Everything in your past just wanna let it go, I've been there)
Cheated, then I (done it)
Fucked around and (done it)
One more time (after all that)
Cheated, then I (done it)
Did it once again
(You got it, you got it bad
Hang up, then you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't want to have fun 'cause all you think aboutYou got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad)

[Verse 2]
When you say that you love me but you really don't
All that shit that you been talking', you ain't really on
Said it's time that I find someone new
And I'm tryin', but I keep on findin' you
And when I get the time, she always split my mind
Sippin' on this drank, how did we slip with time?
'Cause my flaws and my dogs
Got involved, so I think that it's time
That I say what's on my mind

[Chorus]
I think we both cheated love
And I'm certain we both got it bad
(Everything in your past just wanna let it go, I've been there)
Cheated, then I (done it)
Fucked around and (done it)
One more time (after all that)
Cheated, then I (done it)
Did it once again
(You got it, you got it bad
Hang up, then you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't want to have fun 'cause all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad)

[Outro]
You got it bad
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Oh
And I know you got it bad
And I know you got it bad
(You got it, you got it bad
Hang up, then you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't want to have fun 'cause all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad)

[Intro: Alicia Keys]
You don't know my

[Verse 1]
Makin' love to the beat so slow
Makin' love to the beat, girl, it sounds so slow
Come and fuck wit' a G, girl, you already know
I got a hunnid on me for the night
Shawty, don't you leave for the night
No, you don't know my name
Lately, all these bitches want is my fame
You don't know that you the one on my brain
I hit you with that late night text when I'm on the road
Girl, you know I'm tryna vibe wit' you
When you come into my city, I'ma slide wit' you
Side bitch droppin', pussy pop whenever I'm wit' you
Girl, you might've heard my songs, but you don't
(You don't know my name)
Girl, I got a thing for you
Hustle with them dealers when it's time to get that bling for you
Knock it out the ring for you
Whoa, shawty, you know
Can I get a ring from you?
On the phone or a message, just somethin'
Can we get past all these one-word discussions?
I need to know, girl, I need to know somethin' (And I swear it, baby)

[Chorus]
'Cause you don't know my name
You don't know my name
'Cause you don't know my name, whoa
You don't know my name
'Cause you don't know my name (You don't know my name)
You don't know my name (You don't know my name)
'Cause you don't know my name
(And I swear it, baby)

[Verse 2]
Girl, it's obvious you got some problems
It's obvious you got some issues
What if God sent me all in your life
And it's obvious I'm here to fix you?
When I can't go no longer, I need someone stronger
To hold on to get through
And I stay by your side, girl, you know I'ma ride
And come to your rescue
You say that you know my name, the songs that I sing
The set that I bang, the shit that I claim
You don't know 'bout me, I've noticed
But you gon' know 'bout me, I know this

[Chorus]
'Cause you don't know my name
You don't know my name
'Cause you don't know my name, whoa
You don't know my name
'Cause you don't know my name (You don't know my name)
You don't know my name (You don't know my name)
'Cause you don't know my name
(And I swear it, baby)

[Verse 3]
I fell in love with somebody, who doesn't even know my name
Know my name, no, no
And I know this, I'm ashamed
By my name, I'm not talkin' 'bout the name you call me, I'm talkin' 'bout who I am
And I know you don't know my name (You don't know my)
She knows the songs that I sing, all the shit that I claim
And even the set that I bang, but I'm certain she don't know
I'm tryna figure it out, but if she's walkin' out
She will never know my name, can't let her go

[Verse 1]
She keep givin' me looks
I can't stop them eyes from givin' me looks
Don't let me lie to you, girl, I looked
All you gotta do is, make that look

[Chorus]
Soon as you close the door, turn the lights off
You know what it's hittin' for, girl, I might just
Give you what that nigga don't, oh oh
So just close the door, clothes come off, oh oh

[Verse 2]
Bein' honest, just bein' honest
I like the way you're bein' honest, let's keep it honest
You got them lips like Keke Palmer, like Keke palm it
That physical, that education, I go P.E. on it, I'm so on it, yeah
No procrastination hit the hard top, hard top
Then you know I'm dealin' with them mattaz, mattaz
Let you know you dealing with a shotta, shotta
That's the type of shit that shouldn't shock ya

[Chorus]
Soon as you close the door, turn the lights off
You know what it's hittin' for, girl, I might just
Give you what that nigga don't, oh oh
So just close the door, clothes come off, oh oh

[Verse 3]
You got a nigga, but I know he need to step up in it
I got a girl, but you know I need a better shawty
Oh, oh now, now baby, oh yeah yeah yeah yeah, ain't with the playin', I got money to spend
And uh, you got somebody, baby, we got a good thing, yeah yeah
Let the frame down
When I beat that pussy up, you wanna lay down
Now I wanna roll, I'm smokin' backwoods in the cut
She know what it's hittin' for, and it was up

[Chorus]
That's when them shirts come off, shirts come off
I don't wanna see you smoke, see you smoke
Got your back against the wall, close the door
We don't wanna say it's wrong, but it's wrong

[Interlude]
Yeah, I got you. Yeah, uh, yeah

[Verse 4]
Maybe I've been missin'
Maybe I've been dippin', maybe I've been dippin'
Maybe the excuse that I had gotten way too busy for you hoes is gettin' true
And I ain't got the time to kick it with you
Listen, she was with me last Thanksgivin'
Uh, should've been with my sister on Christmas
Uh, but instead I was kickin' it out with Paris
She flew down Lira Galore and oh boy, what an interest
Kells, you remember that winter?
Wait, we made too much money in November
Uh, shit got way too sunny, it's kinda funny
It wasn't long before we started feelin' all of this love for December
Damn, my nigga, we on the tour bus
Steppin' out the House of Blues, where was your bus?
Where are Zoe and Josh now that I got way too famous
And successful for you to afford us?
Wow, my life has just gotten gorgeous
5-star meals on islands, the sand's scorchin'
Started fuckin' this girl and she lands scores and movies
So you might see me poppin' like Lance Gordon
Shout the bitches down to take a chance for me
Take me to the club and spend some bands on me
Take me to the club and buy a dance on me
Shit, it's crazy
Show these niggas, I can paint the picture
Y'all don't deserve to get this paper with me
You wasn't hoppin' out the cable with me
Broke down Civic, parkin' in Camp David with me
Back when I would have to pick a playback
Then drop that nigga off on the way back
Then called Johan because me and Gudda
Been arguin' all day long about who gettin' that A-flat
We used to go hard about them little sessions
I learned to appreciate all the little blessings
Secluded environments and the little sections
You gotta understand how to feel blessings
Look at this lifestyle, look at how we livin', nigga, right now
Look at all these bitches that wouldn't even type a message to us
Now we sayin' they ain't our type now
Story goes, that's how the tables turned

[Chorus]
Walked right out of heaven
Feels like I have damn near thrown my life away
Walked right out of heaven
Don't know what to, don't know what, feels like I

[Verse 1]
Whippin' down, 95
Beggin' God to (please forgive me)
I'll mess it up, what heaven done gave to me
I can see (everything clearer now)
These tints are black as, (black as it's ever been)
Now without my rider, I might shoot somethin' up out here
So I pray that he just, (just shed his grace on me)
Because you let her leave, now
No don't you let her leave, no

[Chorus]
Feels like I just walked right out of heaven
Feels like I have damn near thrown my life away, hey
Scared, just like a child that's lost at seven
Don't know what to do, get back right with you
Feels like I just walked right out

[Verse 2]
Someone told me that if it’s meant to be
She’ll wake up one day, and she’ll forgive me
So the best thing I can do
Is to just let her, let her go, I know
And the more I push, the more she pulls away from me
So I’m asking God for help, Lord I’m just a G
And I need her, I didn’t treat her the way she was meant to be treated
'Cause Lord I did her wrong and she’s gon' leave again

[Chorus]
Feels like I just walked right out of heaven
Feels like I have damn near thrown my life away, hey
Scared, just like a child that's lost at seven
Don't know what to do, get back right with you
Feels like I

[Intro: DJ Drama]
To be honest, we destined for greatness
You know like TV, every day shit
To be even more honest, your time may be up
You know like only on TV once
On TV1, destined for a tragic unsung story
I'm sorry, you just didn't play your cards right

[Verse: Tory Lanez]
Nigga, ma died daddy wasn't there
I was out here gettin' money with the scale
Brother in jail, need a canteen?
Now I'm sendin' money in the mail
Runnin' from the law
Only thing a nigga fearin' out here is the Lord, nigga
Did it all for my dogs, in a fresh pair of draws
Aw yeah, hit the window with the top down
Ride around, niggas in the mini caravan
Lookin' for a new wrist
Drop down in a bent air force, I be lookin' for a new link
Sure nigga, oh boy, you can tell them old niggas that it's over
Nigga came with that new shit, true shit
Dog, I been waitin' on you niggas
Motherfuckers hatin' on me, but it's cool
I'm gettin' paper, why you suckers got to play on a nigga?
For the name hoes change, nigga
Watch what you claim on these bitches
But the fame, my nigga
For the fame, only real bitch I had was Keisha
And she still changed on a nigga
You could picture the pain in my scriptures
Lame in your mixture
Young nigga, hangin' my tone
From the cold ass nights I was stinkin' alone
And my clothes ranked and they reeked of the dank ass weed
From the blanks and the floor, my nigga
Just love if you love me, don't ask me for nothin'
Just know that you got it
When Jay comin' back to Miami next week
Then you know that it's poppin'
I'm all in your crib like I'm Santa bitch
Don't make me open your stockings, open like Stockton
Grandma told me if I'm gonna be somethin'
Then it better be lawyer or doctor
But I'ma make more as a rapper, make more as a rapper
She ain't believe me, I did it and told her to open my chapter
And that's how you show by example

[Outro: DJ Drama]
You see, my mom always thought I should get a regular job
She didn't really see the future in this, I had to show her
I had the license to burn money in what I was doing
I haven't had a real job in 20 years
If we can do it, so can you

[Intro: DJ Scream]
In all honesty, let me speak the truth
They ain't nothing in real street niggas
You know real trap niggas want more for Christmas
That's some new Gucci Mane nigga

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
You heard I got long paper, I got it on me
Yeah my money long baby, I got it on me
We can get along baby cause I got it on me
You heard my money long baby, yeah I got it on me

[Verse: Project Pat]

[?] trigger on the nine, I'm about to sneeze
Fast booger in my nose, I'm about to squeeze
Gun to the boy head, he on his knees
Ran off with 30 bands, 25 p's
What the fuck you pussy's thinking pulling moves like me
Then you try to put it on me, when you, you not me
Changing lanes without a signal causes car crashes
Bull with my chopper, for you slaves y'all get 30 lashes
Street niggas get it off with the hard or the soft
Turn my dick from hard to soft, insert it in her mouth
That's yo girlfriend on them xans, man that's that Memphis shit
Talk a bitch out a couple grams, that's that pimping shit

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
You heard I got long paper, I got it on me
Yeah my money long baby, I got it on me
We can get along baby cause I got it on me
You heard my money long baby, yeah I got it on me

[Interlude: DJ Scream]

The night GuWop stole Christmas

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
You heard I got long paper, I got it on me
Yeah my money long baby, I got it on me
We can get along baby cause I got it on me
You heard my money long baby, yeah I got it on me

[Verse 1]
Slow down, crazy child
You're so ambitious for a juvenile
But if you're so smart, tell me why is you still so afraid?
Where's the fire, what's the hurry 'bout?
Better cool it off before you burn it out
So much to do, only so many hours in a day, hey

[Chorus]
You know when the truth is told
You can get what you want, you can just get old
Gonna kick off 'fore you even get halfway through, ooh
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?

[Verse 2]
Slow down, you're doin' fine
You can't be everything you want to be before your time
Though it's so romantic on the borderline tonight, tonight, night
Too bad, it's the life you lead
So ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need
You can see when you're wrong
You know, can't always see when you're right. you're right, right

[Chorus]
Got your passion, got your pride
Don't you know that only fools are satisfied?
Dream on, don't imagine they'll all come true, ooh
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?

[Outro]
Slow down, crazy child
Take the phone off the hook and disappear for a while
It's alright, you can afford to lose a day or two

[Intro: DJ Scream]

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I’m tryna get it my way
They say Guwop got bales and bricks, that’s what the FBI say
Half a million dollar car, I pulled it out the driveway
Got 2 million dollars on a bus pulled over on the highway
Nigga owe me, come back shooting like Big Worm did on Friday
These niggas twitter beefing but I keep AK's at MySpace
We all in its entirety, menace to society
Rich and black minority, white folks call me violent
They tried to ban Gucci Mane music, and the people started rioting
Drop top Maserati, no more fucking license
Man look what they did to 2Pac, look what they did to Tyson
I got two vices, smoke weed and shot dices

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I just bought two pints, and they look perfect
I don’t want no bitches out the hood ‘less they look perfect
I just bought some Forgi’s for the Phantom now it look perfect
Ever since I ran into your nanny, that bitch look perfect
I don’t want no, ‘less they looking perfect
I just need my, ooh it look perfect
Baby bring me the, baby the candy look perfect
I won’t touch on that, unless it look perfect

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I want an AR; I’m drinking on the day job
I ain’t talking ‘bout no motherfucking 

[?]
DK hit em with the fucking car
I’ma hit em with the fucking AR
I’ma cash out on them bitches, get it right back out the trenches
Fucking on em way too fast, I need a ticket
Like I’m beefing with her brother, man you know Lil Mama with it
Bought her ten pairs red bottoms, man you know Lil Mama shitted
Killing em, red tatted lips on the coochie, man you know my dog gon’ kiss it
DK casino, I pass em to him, and you know he gon’ kill it kill it
And you know my plug came from a village
And you know my room Michael Jordan image
And you know I’m really Scottie Pippen bitches

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I just bought two pints, and they look perfect
I don’t want no bitches out the hood ‘less they look perfect
I just bought some Forgi’s for the fend’ now it look perfect
Ever since I ran into your nanny, that bitch look perfect
I don’t want no, ‘less they looking perfect
I just need my, ooh it look perfect
Baby bring me the, baby the candy look perfect
I won’t touch on that, unless it look perfect

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Squad!
I'm clearly crack, you niggas clearly wack
No stainless steel my pistol clearly black
I don't pop shit I got chaps for that, he a shooter, with a shooter
What up Nook, free Diego
What up Kirbo, what up Rooster, free Kenny
Catch you out of bounds, my youngins blammin’

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I got twin FNs on me, please don’t put your hands on me
No yellow tape, but when you see him I want you to grab homie
But if I see him before you see him then I’ma blam homie
Only thing I pray is that this gun don’t jam on me
Only thing I pray is that this gun don’t jam on me
Only thing I pray is that this gun don’t jam on me
Only thing I pray is that this gun don’t jam on me
Only thing I pray is that this gun don’t jam on me

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Go green light, get him, rush him, fuck him
Stick him, stuck him, grab him, slab him
Kicking out rhyming, always keep my pistol handy
Wanna go to war that’s fine and dandy
Easier than snatching up baby candy
Clip big as a baby panda
RIPs are hard to handle
Gucci and a murder scandal
Call my lawyer, fuck an answer
I’m my own goddamn employer
Fuck you pig, go die of cancer
Gucci Mane done killed someone
But fuck that shit, go light a candle
Try the Wop, I gotta pop
I bet I’m sending out body shots
Fox Five News, eleven o’clock
The neighbors heard a lot of shots
Two young niggas with dicks attached
Had a note that said come get me back
My MAC got 200 in it, we shoot out for 40 minutes
Sawed off shotgun, running with it
Who want some can come and get it

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I got twin FNs on me, please don’t put your hands on me
No yellow tape, but when you see him I want you to grab homie
But if I see him before you see him then I’ma blam homie
Only thing I pray is that this gun don’t jam on me
Only thing I pray is that this gun don’t jam on me
Only thing I pray is that this gun don’t jam on me
Only thing I pray is that this gun don’t jam on me
Only thing I pray is that this gun don’t jam on me

[Verse 3: OG Maco]
Big Guwop, Big homie Flock
And OG Mac got Glocks and gas
Shooters only want a stack
And fuck who I’m not even there
Triple threat, ain’t making threats
But Hydro’s ass will leave you wet
Used to play with water guns
Them super soakers just a TEC
Mama always pray for me, but who pray for my enemies?
Banana clip, my rifle be exactly what can't speak
Dirty but it never jam cause I just got the barrel cleaned
Niggas dissing turn to pictures, have 'em laughing like who me?

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I got twin FNs on me, please don’t put your hands on me
No yellow tape, but when you see him I want you to grab homie
But if I see him before you see him then I’ma blam homie
Only thing I pray is that this gun don’t jam on me
Only thing I pray is that this gun don’t jam on me
Only thing I pray is that this gun don’t jam on me
Only thing I pray is that this gun don’t jam on me
Only thing I pray is that this gun don’t jam on me

Don't forget that I came from the bottom
With niggas who rockin', put 6 in the chamber
Don't forget that I came from the bottom
Don't forget when they did me no favors
Won't forget how I came in the club on the sofa
Put Margiela kicks on the table
Hoppin', hoppin' out with my maneuvers

We had enough of the fuckery, time to get up on it
Grip up on it, let them niggas know to get up on it time to get this shit poppin'
Illest nigga since big poppa

And let them niggas know I got the whip driver
Hoppin' out the new Mercedes, nigga

Popping mollies
Rolling hard

You won’t believe that everyday she leaves she leaves with me
You won’t believe that everyday she leaves she leaves the key
I know her favourite food
She like eat Japanese

Bone appetit
And you ain’t gotta see the hood I bring the hood with me
And we don’t need no bodyguard

You gambling with them other guys
Stop the gambling
And ain’t nothing for you to see
So stop the raffling

And only you that you're embarrassing

I like a bitch that like a bitch I make her fantasy

And I ain't got no problem handcuffing a dead man (Nigga, what?)

[Verse 2: Sy Ari da Kid]
RIP to Dunky, was a dear friend (Yuh)
HOS for Aero Music, that's a dead end (Du-du)
Abort that mission if that shit don't bring no bread in (Woo, woo)
I say I'm broke, 'cause when you stuck, they bring the feds in (Woo, woo)
The way I ball, I think I should pay for the Redskins (Skrrt)
See in the streets, ain't no such thing as a best friend (Brrt)
You shopping Lenox, my niggas will be at the west end (Hood)
I'm outta space, like I relate to the Jetsons (Yeah)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm in the trap boy, matching on a dead end (Dead)
With them young niggas that'll bust your head in (Your head)
I got a trap house matching in the fuckin' cul-de-sac (Uh)
And I'm peeping out the peephole, AK with the shoulder scrap (Grrow, grrow)
Had to fit in, it's a dead end
I heard the feds on me, you came to a dead end (What?)
They heard that Gucci Mane just bust a nigga head in (Woo)
And I ain't got no problem handcuffing a dead man (Nigga, what?)

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Riching you trying to maintain
Hundred benz and balmains
I got a new rollie it's plain
You cooking
I’m fucking your man
They say that I talk about change
Bitch you stop flexing with ranges
Her Rory ain’t driving no range
I bet you shit ain’t gonna change

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Rich The Kid and Guwop
Ground round I got four Glock
Kevin working the safe spot
I’ve been gone cause the block hot
Trappin, ain’t whippin no word
Your riches ain’t bought me a verse
Yow bitch I might lift up your skirt
I’m fucking her making her squirt
Who trippin my phone ringing
She got the dough
I’m dropping her home
I’m fucking that bitch
I won’t pick up the phone (No)
I got the word to fix you
I never grow up as a freestyler
I never grow up as a freestyler
I guess the rest is just history

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
It’s more than one way to skin a cat
My crew say it’s a new day
My top missing like a toupee
I’m a superstar like Lupe
I’m war down while sushi
Be Gucci, my movie
My diamonds coated
And a smoothie
Imma spin five like a ozzy
Dont pity me
They sick of me
These pussy nigga tricking me
If getting money is a crime
Then I’m guilty cause I’m filthy
I’m balling like I’m an athlete
No jump shots
No track meets
My money longer than Shaqs feet
Gucci Mane the O Trap king
Get hats down
I’m socker king
I fly down, a private plane
Dope price keep going up and down
Like the stock exchange
Pound of this and a pound of that
And a brick a this and a little a that
I show a lame how to make a change
They ain’t never change
There’s project change

[Verse 4: Smurf]
Imma wait like fat people jogging
But a house on the hill
When I look you
Imma wonder why I never see no black people walking
West side daddy
Big yellow braces
Spinning with a weight
News spin on his face lift
Hit me a liquor
Spit out the fakers
Took all my crews on vacation
Money, money that’s all I think about
BSM that’s all I’m screaming out
Ten seventeen, ain’t nothing else to think about
Mack 11 in my car
Make a nigga pull it out
Big ole pimps off
Big ole ring on
Big magazines at the Coronarita
Just layed back
Me and my amigos
Give me twelve for a four pound a weed though
How your mamma cry like Dope Boy mother
Lay on your couch
Flee like Dope Boy nigga
I’m so L A
Left the lawyer for you
Yall go fuck around
And make me gotta pay my lawyer
Long trench coat
Looking like big Tracy
30 inch long horn Chevy Tracy
So L A gotta keep my Stacy
You fucking with a big dog
You might catch rabies

Ziggy
Zaytoven

[Verse 1]
You niggas know how much I made on I-20
Your baby daddy broke, I bury him in all twenties (Damn)
I had mad when I was up going like nine cubits
You know Gucci had that shit for six-fifty (No)
In 1995, I ain't have a pretty penny (Damn)
2005 man, I had that nigga ugly milli (Wow)
The most hated in the game, nigga, ask 50
I went broke, I ain't have nothin' but one-sixty (Damn)
Sometimes I do a show, they say they wanna shop with me (Okay)
So when I think about it I wish I had a truck with me (Truck)
I might just call a nigga bluff and see if he fuck with me
My star status niggas can't get enough muggie (Woah)

[Chorus]
My own status can't touch me
Nah, you can't touch me
Got a hundred nigga rush
Hundred nigga rush
Not to rush 'em all with me
Rush 'em all with me
Dare a nigga fucking touch me
I dare a nigga touch me
Got a hundred Russian nigga
And they say the wanna rush up
Drinking Vodka with a Russian bitch
She know I wanna fuck her
Thought I'd never sell dope again
Never sell dope again
Whippin' dope
I'm whippin' dope and now the junkers rushing in

[Verse 2]
Have been 'round my city with a hundred in my pope bag (Woah)
Half a pound of cash with the bitch 'cause she too bad (Damn)
Rush into the room getting head in the drop head (Drop)
She ate the little left and told me it come with a price tag (Well, damn)
Rich, I ain’t wealthy, just a nigga with a big bag (It's Gucci)
If you ain't work for million dollars, I don't wanna chit chat (Shh)
Your baby mama eat a nigga dick like a Kit-Kat
Kidnap a nigga bitch, slap her, get the chip back
If you kill that nigga for me, I'll make you a rich man
Kick spice on my kicks like I can't find a falcon
Before I got in the game, I was selling cherry girl (Damn)
Put her in a taxi, put her number in the trash can (Wop)

[Chorus]
My own status can't touch me
Nah, you can't touch me
Got a hundred nigga rush
Hundred nigga rush
Not to rush 'em all with me
Rush 'em all with me
Dare a nigga fucking touch me
I dare a nigga touch me
Got a hundred Russian nigga
And they say the wanna rush up
Drinking Vodka with a Russian bitch
She know I wanna fuck her
Thought I'd never sell dope again
Never sell dope again
Whippin' dope

Yeah, okay
You need to get done, done, done, done at work, come over
We just need to slow the motion
Don't give that away to no one
Long distance, I need you
When I see potential, I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over
Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got niggas tryna end me, oh (Yeah)
I spilled all my emotions tonight, I’m sorry
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'

[Intro]
Brrt, brrt, bang, bang
Ayy
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat

[Chorus]
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat

[Verse]
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, ridin' 'round on boulders
Money sittin' up, it sits way above your shoulders
I was eatin' pork and rinds with a bitch from New York Times
I don't eat no pork and rinds but that bitch was mighty fine
I got gold all on my necklace, tatted up my arms
Now my mama think I'm reckless, got guns under my mattress
I was juggin since a youngin', free my older cousin Reesey
He from Hamilton not D.C, I rock N.Bs like I'm Gleeshy
Flip phone banging off the walls, Gucci on my drawers
Why the fuck you in these streets if you're scared of them four walls?
I was strokin' on your sister, she was callin' me her mister
She suck dick for a picture, it's Lil Yachty nice to meet you
I was juggin' off them stacks, countin' up them racks
Almost had a lifetime sentence, but I beat it, shout out to Pat!
Pat, that's my lawyer, he got me off them chargers
8 stacks for that boy, he took care of the boy

[Chorus]
Cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota

[Sound effect: gunshot]

[EMINEM]

I’m a kick it
The motherfuckin’ liquid
That I be spittin’
Infinite ammunition
Yeah you wishin’
You try to step to this but you died
You tried to fuck with my style but get denied
And get hit
And get pushed back to the fuckin lab
When I stab you in the abdomen
When I grab a pen and jab it in

[EMINEM begins CANIBUS impression]

Travelin like an abdomen and gag you with it
Javelin when I’m stabbing it and grabbin it
With the Canibus animal animus
Element jam it is
Whatever lattice magnanimous
And the shadow is adamant
The equilibrium will lay on top of these mathematics
In alphabetical order, Destroyer!
Dropped 40 for a Glock 40 that's a hood discount
That's an accessory gun, sesemy seed buns
For the beef y'all brung, y'all done fucked up
Fucked with the wrong fuck up
I've been a nut since pops fucked moms
Fucked up in the head, I'm living, but I'm brain-dead
Life goes on and you don't need a psychic in order to read my palm
Niggas'll get you first where I'm from
That's why I Creep on 'em, I creep on 'em, I creep on 'em
Niggas play cool, put the heat on 'em
Make the temperature reach the highest peak on 'em

I said you don't need a pyschic in order to read my palm

[Intro: Pacewon]
Some Outsidaz shit
I started hearing laughter in my head
Somebody laughing at me
Always laughing at me
I’m ‘bout to go crazy
So I started to set it on niggas, nah mean?
Pacewon!

[Bridge: Pacewon]
I’m high like Redman, tripping with a tab of acid
In my headband (‘Bout to lose my mind)
The name’s Pacewon, I’ll kick that ass quickly
When I die I’ma try to take the whole world with me (Me!)
Raw rhymes, penetrate the kidney
When I die I’ma try to take the whole world with me
(I got plans to lock it down) Take it with me
Take it with me, the whole world with me

[Verse 1: Pacewon]
Yeah, I be hitting you with rude shit
I be rolling like crews with new whips, call it stupid
But I mastered the fantastic ghetto bastard
Raw rap style to kick that ass with
Rough as Brillo, nympho spreading like info
More than the Jacksons got kinfolk
Your crew not strong, they stink like your mother feet
When she walk in shoes with no socks on
Light as popcorn, me! Disciplining fresh MCs
That you’d be scared to rock for

[Chorus: Pacewon]
(Who dat?) I’m low down and I’m shifty
When I die I’ma try to take the whole worth with me
(Me!) Most MCs get slapped ‘cause they sissy
When I die I’ma try to take the whole worth with me
Take the world, take it with me
Take it with me, set it!

[Interlude: Eminem]
Yeah! Eminem!
Dirty Dozen! Yeah!

[Verse 2: Eminem (Pacewon)]
I’m in the sound-proof booth without a roof
Drunk off 180-proof vodka with Dr. Ruth (What!)
We in the vocal room inhaling Magic Markers
Sitting in the dark lighting our blunts with sparklers
We got my man Pacewon behind the boards
Cause we tied the engineer up with output cords (Outsidaz, what!)
Bizarre’s in the lobby with the Beatles, smoking bowls
Poking holes in his veins with dirty needles
We get all doped up from popping uppers
And run a train on Foxy Brown without rubbers (Uh, uh-huh, yeah)
Smoking homegrown drugs, that’s why you can barely tell
What the fuck we’re saying, like Bone-Thugs (Uh!)
Hitting blunts ’til my lungs contort, smoke
Then take one more short toke before I snort coke (What!)
Shit, I been doing lines all day (What!)
My mind’s all clay from smelling Pine-Sol spray (What!)
What! No, hold up, hold up, hold up (Hold up!)
Smoking laced weed wrapped up in a fruit Roll-Up
My lungs are all swole-up and ‘bout to bust open
I’m just hoping I don’t die from snorting crushed Motrin

[Chorus 2: Eminem (Pacewon)]
I need drugs, somebody fix me
When I die, I’ma try to take the whole world with me (Me!)
Twelve blunts, plus I’m bringing your girl with me
When I die, I’ma try to take the whole world with me
I’m not coming back, so don’t send no one to get me
When I die, I’ma try to take the whole world with me (Gimme dat)
Fuck that, give me all my shit free
When I die, I’ma try to take the whole world with me

[Verse 3: Bizarre (Pacewon)]
Wack MCs, there’s a new sheriff in town
Put your guns down or die with a ill frown
The Outsidaz doing uppers and downers (Uh-huh, yeah)
Clowners, even masters scared to hang around us (Ugh!)
I’m a slob that don’t have a job (What!)
Peek through your windows, steal the good from your mom (Ma!)
We the starters, y’all niggas hit the benches
Smacking more hoes than Joe Jackson at feminine convention
Cop some mushrooms, I just can’t see
Pull me out the bathroom, I’m ‘bout to OD (D!)
Nasty, dirty, some say I’m filthy
Every time I drop the rap, Outs be like… (Ill, B!)
Brain’s too high, have no fear
Eat the pussy of a girl with burning gonorrhea
I made a box with a thugger on DD
Our crew’s more stupid on wax than Cowdy from Lion King
Who’s the big guy high off chocolate kai
If you disrespect me, you’ll lyrically die (Die!)

[Chorus 3: Bizarre (Pacewon)]
Somebody hide me, somebody get me
When I die, I take the whole world with me (Me!)
I’m ‘bout to do your girl named Cindy
When I die, I take the whole world with me (Lockin' it down!)
You bomb my set, I give her Good-N-Plenty
When I die, I take the whole world with me
You know my flow is so ill
MCs on the microphone and get verbally killed (Killed!)

[Outro: Pacewon]
All y’all niggas’ll get killed
Fucking with the Dirty D
Pacewon up in this motherfucker
All motherfuckers better act like they know
You MC, I don’t give a fuck where you from
Close to me or far from me
I’ma see your wack ass
Pacewon! Pacewon!
I never, never, never, never, never
Never, never, never
Knew I was lost, baby

Oh, until I met you
Now it's joy and happiness, girl yes
Feels like I've been blessed, girl
Lord, have mercy now

(Well, well, well) Lay back
Just relax, baby
I don't want you to move
(Don't Move)
If there's something that you want
Tell me, baby
I'll run out and get it for you
(I'll do that baby)
You deserve to be treated, yeah
In the best of ways
I'm going to treat you
Like a queen baby
I want to do that for you
Each and every, every, every, day
Ah no one does it better
Does it better than you, girl
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
I want to spend all of my time
Just loving you
Loving you

Chorus:
Oh, oh, oh
Baby, I'm totally lost
Lost in your love
Don't want to be found, baby
Like the way you
Move you love around
Lost in your love

Something else

In your arms, I'm a new man
I'm a new man
No one loves me
Like you can. no
So sweet in the things you do
I swear there's nothing
Like loving you
Let's make it last forever, ever
Forever, and a day, oh
Promise me we'll stay together
Well, well, well

Are we going to
Keep it this way, yeah
Ah, no one does it better
(Does it better), does it better
Better than you do, no
And I just want to keep right on
Loving you, Loving you

And, oh, oh
I'm totally, babe
Lost in your love
I don't want to be found
(stay up in here, right here)
Lost in your love

Never knew, never knew, never knew
Never, never, never, never, never
Never, never, never knew baby

Lost in your love
Your love could be so good, girl
Keep on pushing me
Lost in your love
I don't want to
Don't want to be found
Lost in your love
I like the way you
Move me around and around
And around, and around....
Lost in your love

Touch me here, touch me here
Touch me there, touch me there
You've been touching stuff
I never, never knew
Was there, baby
Nobody does it better
(Bring it out of me, baby)

Well, well, well
Lost in your love
Nobody does it better
No one can compare, baby
Lost in your love
And I want to love you
For the rest of my days
The rest of my days, yea baby
Lost in your love
Nobody does it better
Nobody does the things you do
(Forever, ever, and ever, and ever)
Lost in your love

Nobody does it better
And better, and better
And better it's getting better
Lost in your love
You got me wrapped up
Wrapped up, wrapped up loving you
Lost in your love

I know, I know, I know, I know
Lost in your love
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
Lost in your love
Nobody does it better
Nobody does it better
Na, na, na, na
Lost in your love

[Verse 1]
Money in the bank, gas in the tank
Say you wanna get a little crazy
Your hands up on my knees, such a little tease
I'm acting like it ain't gonna phase me
Girl tonight the world is ours
Shooting like some southern stars
From the backseat down a backstreet of your heart

[Chorus]
Ridin' these FM waves
Burnin' these reckless days
I can't wait to get a taste
So get a little close, a little closer
Float in these country roads
Tearin' off each other's clothes
Heads back, curl up them toes
And get a little closer, a little closer

[Verse 2]
Waylon in truck, whiskey in this cup
Dancing with your back up on the console
Brush your hair back from your eyes
Put your fingertips in mine
Girl, pull me back until tomorrow
Set the evening sky on fire
Burning up with that desire
From the backseat down a backstreet in your heart

[Chorus]
Ridin' these FM waves
Burnin' these reckless days
I can't wait to get a taste
So get a little close, a little closer
Float in these country roads
Tearin' off each other's clothes
Heads back, curl up them toes
And get a little closer, a little closer

[Chorus]
Ridin' these FM waves
Burnin' these reckless days
I can't wait to get a taste
So get a little close, a little closer
Float in these country roads
Tearin' off each other's clothes
Heads back, curl up them toes
And get a little closer, a little closer

[Chorus]
Ooh, champagne pourin' down
Arms, legs wrapped around you
Ooh, champagne, let it fall down
Arms, legs keep grabbing

[Verse 1]
See, I be catchin' you starin', be careful
The idle mind is a dangerous place to be left in
But keep your eyes on me
Yeah, your heart don't stand a chance
It feels like it's been far too long
Your knees can't hold your legs
Your feet just want to pace
The eyes keep me all in a trance
Let me ask you
Would you leave it all in the back of your head
Or all in the palm of my hand, huh?
Ain't nobody holding you back
Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl?
Your heart don't stand a chance
Your knees just want to break
Your eyes keep me all in a trance
And let me ask you, mmm
I know the approach is so far from what you're used to
But you know it
And do I hold a candle to the last one over your moon?
Baby, of course I do
And I'm not closing my tab
Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl?
Huh, your heart don't stand a chance

[Chorus]
Ooh, champagne pourin' down
Arms, legs wrapped around you
Ooh, champagne, let it fall down
Arms, legs keep grabbing

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, two-step in the corridor
Spinning the greatest hits of Hall & Oates
Open of chronic smoke
I know my time will flee
But your heart don't stand a chance, uh
It feels like it's been far too long, hmm
The moment is all that we have
My meter should be up by the half
A ticket is the least of my cares
So let me ask you, uh
Am I dreaming?
Mind on the tip of a cloud
Or is it real as the stone in your crown?
Say, ain't nobody towing my Jag, uh
Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl, huh?
Your heart don't stand a chance
I'm waiting for the white flag
You're talking with the blunt in your hand
And won't you pass that, huh?
I know in the morning
The sunlight cover your wounds, huh
But I'm hoping that I look the same as the way you always knew
Baby, of course, I flew
But I'm not over what we had, huh
Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl, uh?
Your heart don't stand a chance

[Chorus]
Ooh, champagne pourin' down
Arms, legs wrapped around you
Ooh, champagne, let it fall down
Arms, legs keep grabbing

[Skit]
I remember being tumbled around and not being able to get to the surface where the air was
And looking down and seeing my body spinning around in the white water

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Why the hell would you run this game?
Both my hands are tied
Afraid of thinking I dug my own grave
Fuck around with this
Strange and elusive, too afraid to lose it
I don't mind this pain
Most niggas want you for your candy
They'll never know just how long it takes
I wave my own pride
And put it all on the line

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
There I go, volunteering punishment
Self inflicted pain, sickness over used
Way over used
Here I stay, hey, time to time
It must be what you put me through, ha
It must be what you put me through

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
A little while longer
A bit more time
Why would you run these thoughts across my mind?
Please, relieve me
As cool as I remain
There's a point in which I'll lose my self restraint
Say, love, most niggas would've left you lonely
I fancy throwin' it all away
I see it to my own demise
How much longer will I let it ride?

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
There I go, volunteering punishment
Self inflicted pain, sickness over used
Will I let it ride? (Here I stay)
Here I stay, time to time
It must be what you put me through (Yeah, time to time)
It must be what you put me through

[Outro: Anderson .Paak]
Hey, it must be (Here I stay, time to time)
It must be what you put me through
It must be what you put me through

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
With all the kissin', the touchin', the bitin', the tuggin'
You know, you know I love what you do
(You know I know I love what you do)
And all the spittin', the cursin', the fightin' and fussin'
You know I'm only fuckin' with you
(I bet you I was only thinkin' if I)
If I could, I'd take you everywhere
But you know I can't do nothin' with you
(You know I can't do nothin' with you)
You know I never looked as good as I do, and it's the truth
No bullshit, I'm nothin' without you

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Say, I should take this heart and pawn it at the auction
I don't need it, I'ma slang this bitch and take ya shoppin'
'Cause what good is any heart if it can break in pieces?
I would rather have no feelings, than cryin' and sobbin'
When I met you, I was broke as the rope on the faucet
I had dreams that I would blow like a Nintendo Cartridge
I was hungry, I was dirty, I needed a shower
Said you fed me, and you clothed me, you packed me a sack lunch
Papa said, "When I get older, get a girl like your momma"
But I'm twenty (cough) years old and runnin' out of options
How I'm supposed to trust ya?
Ain't you one of them ones tryin' to run up
Pose for the perfect picture, upload and post it?
Question: Is you with me or not?
I'm from the city where they wear bikinis in the water drought
But I'm used to having cyclones blown in and out of my life
So it's no biggie if you need time to figure it out

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
With all the kissin', the touchin', the bitin', the tuggin'
You know, you know I love what you do
(You know I know I love what you do)
And all the spittin', the cursin', the fightin' and fussin'
You know I'm only fuckin' with you
(I bet you I was only thinkin' if I)
If I could, I'd take you everywhere
But you know I can't do nothin' with you
(You know I can't do nothin' with you)
You know I never looked as good as I do, and it's the truth
No bullshit, I'm nothin' without you

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
You know you wrong, shit, you out of pocket
Remember you was couch surfin', you ain't have a casa
And mi casa, I would buy you shoes from out the locker
Even though I heard around the town from all the gossip
Between they legs and slidin' limousines in garages
Heard your mama cheated on ya daddy, you just like her
Karma come around, remember what happened to Tiger
Game over, dead wrong, uh, Biggie Wallace
I was the one you counted on before you stacked your wallets
Talkin' 'bout me, motherfucker, you the one with problems
Haha, you played yourself for a photo, uh, that you ain't know, though
I only took from niggas trying to slide up in the DM
And show 'em I was happy with the nigga I was seein'
But you fucked up, stupid, so I guess I'll go and see 'em
As you contemplate how to get me back like Liam
No fuckin' tonight, I'll be gone by the PM, nigga

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
With all the kissin', the touchin', the bitin', the tuggin'
You know, you know I love what you do
(You know I know I love what you do)
And all the spittin', the cursin', the fightin' and fussin'
You know I'm only fuckin' with you
(I bet you I was only thinkin' if I)
If I could, I'd take you everywhere
But you know I can't do nothin' with you
(You know I can't do nothin' with you)
You know I never looked as good as I do, and it's the truth
No bullshit, I'm nothin' without you

Might not get, might not get any better
Might not, might not get, might not get any better
Might not, might not get

[Intro]
Well, you told me your whole life story in a few shorts
All the while, I never knew the tone of your voice
A half an hour, I ramble on way too much (My love)
Alone with my own thoughts (My love)
(1, 2, 3, come on–) Enough is enough

[Verse 1]
There's a plain way to call it, but it's never that obvious for me
I'm in a communion, I got needs
The combination of all my life's complaints and a few strong drinks
I don't remember the parking lot
I just remember the song we sang
(Ooh, my love)
And the song we sang
(My love)

[Hook]
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on–

1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me (My love)
Come on, you feel me (The parking lot)
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me (My love)
1, 2, 3, come on–

[Verse 2]
Bring the corners from left to right
How many more will it take to get a crossfade?
Coming closer to midnight and I'm wide awake
And ain't you afraid? Was afraid
Couldn't wait to get you naked on the first date
But you made me wait
So it takes one to make one
The compromise we made
Please believe me, I don't recall the parking lot
I just remember the song we sang
And the song we sang
And the song we s–

[Hook]
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me

A blast from your golden past)

[Intro]
You know I see you from afar, right?
Hey, it's alright
Listen, I would've 

[?]

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be like that
You don't need me in that light
It's alright with me
Just send it off, and I'll give it right back
Right down to the last phase
There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be lite weight

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
You know I really can't fuss about it
You know I really can't funk without it
You know I really can't funk without it
You know I really can't fuss about it

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be like that
You don't need me in that light
It's alright with me
Just send it off, and I'll give it right back
Right down to the last phase
There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be lite weight

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
(You know I see you from afar, right?)
You know I really can't fuss about it
You know I really can't funk without it
You know I really can't funk without it
You know I really can't fuss about it

[Interlude: Sample]
(Thought you might've wanted to say somethin'
So I was comin' up to you
It's cool if I come up to you, right?

[?])

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be like that
You don't need me in that light
It's alright with me
Just send it off, and I'll give it right back
Right down to the last phase
There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be lite weight

[Outro]
"Hey, you got a light?"
"Oh, yes, here you are"
"Thanks, you want a toke?"
"No, no thanks"
"This stuff is getting harder to get"
"Johnny"
"Yeah?"

[Verse]
Yeah, I can't wait for the moment you can take off
I pray you don't have to cut my time short
I would rather not say much
But if I do, it will be forward
I can't pull no punches, baby doll
The gods have approved
The universe is in tune with me and you
That's why we here involved
I'm too in love
What you do this for?
Your body moves in fluid motion
Hands in two and two, I'm open
Who's it for? Ooh, it's yours
I don't know if I'm the one you want to stay with
But I know that I'm the only one who makes you cum

[Hook]
And as soon as I break down the wall
I'm riding the wave of your waterfall
As soon as I break down the wall
I'm riding the wave of your waterfall
As soon as I break down the wall
I'm riding the wave of your waterfall

[Outro]
Ooh, don't touch me, baby
Don't touch me, baby
Wait, I'm okay, I'm alright
Give me space, don't touch me, baby

[Skit: Anderson .Paak]
(Do you have girlfriends?)
You pickin' on me?
(No, why are you saying that?)
Why are you picking on me?
(Why would I do that? Now let me ask you this question)
Why you pickin' on me?
Shut up and sit down! I told you to sit down!

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Don't use it, don't use it all at once
Baby girl, your prime is about that long
Don't use it, timing is all we got
Baby girl, your prime is about that long

[Verse: Anderson .Paak]
Oh, hell no
I had to get back for the candy, uh
I flew for an hour then landed, oh
She live on a beautiful campus, oh
She dumb as a brick but she pass all her classes
Know what she want and she know I ain't shit but a savage, ooh
She soaking up game
Her brain is a series of pamphlets, wow
She told me a story as long as her lashes
Oh, what a hopeless romantic
Fucking with jokers and addicts
She told me everybody close to her age is full of mad shit
I said, 'Baby girl, you ain't even old enough to be jaded'
And woah, she want visual stimulation
Short attention span and little patience
I like Hennessy and record players
Teddy Pendergrass and Sammy Davis
Opposites attract, I swear, we a magnet, uh
Don't be fucking up your scholarship
I can't help you with grants
Word to my father, my word and my balls is 'bout all that I honor
As God is my witness if you don't jump back in this bed

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Don't use it all at once
Baby girl, your prime is about that long
(Do what you want, what you want, long as you jump in the bed)
I only want to do what feels right
I have to be gone before the midterms
You're making up your mind, you're out of songs, aren't you?
I wanted an encore, more tunes

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
Hey, come back to bed
Come back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah
Come jump in the bed, jump in the bed with me, ah
Come back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah
Come jump in the bed, jump in the bed with me, ah
Come back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah
Come jump in the bed, jump in the bed with me, ah
Come back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah
Come jump in the bed

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Don't use it all at once
Baby girl, your prime is about that long
Timing is all we got
Baby girl, your prime is about that long

Y'all niggas got me hot, yuh
Uh, niggas, tell me how, yuh, yuh, say

[Verse 1]
Hey! Well, that's exactly what a nigga came for
Huh, you throwin' shots from afar
I'ma meet you at your front door
Uh, so hard to be doing what you really meant for, beauty
Huh, but don't I make it look easy?
Don't I make it look good?

[Chorus]
Hey, now you drank up all my liquor, come on
What I'm 'posed to do now?
And you talking all that shit, now come on
You gon' have to back it up, hey
If I get too high now, sugar, come on
I might never come down
You might not ever come down
Let me get down
You might not ever come down
Naw, let me get down
You might not ever come down
Let me get down!

[Refrain]
You might never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile

[Verse 2]
C'mon, uh
Can't beat it, can't beat it, can't beat it
Can't beat it with a big bat though
Can't see her with these pitch black Gucci frames on
Let me take these bitches off
Let me get the full scope, hold up
Huh, full screen, HD, let me take another picture
Let me pull it to the pre-show
Whoa, cool beans, cool beans
That's a whole lot of reefer
Let me help you with the pre-roll

[Chorus]
You drank up all my liquor, come on
What I'm 'posed to do now?
And you talking all that shit, now come on
You gon' have to back it up
If I get too high now, sugar, come on
I might never come down
You might not ever come down
Naw, naw, naw, let me get down
You might not ever come down
Now let me get down
You might not never come down
Naw, let me get down!

[Refrain]
You might never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile
You might never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile

Before Vietnam, when boards were long and hair were short, the center of the surfing world was a place called Malibu

[Verse 1]
Yeah, all of that ass you carrying, you gotta be shitting me
All of that body that you came with
But, where are you mentally?
I know ya hear it all the time
But, you ain't gon' hear from me
I just wanna focus on them lovelies
What's behind them tig-ol-bitties?

[Pre-Chorus]
They say the heart is underneath
Underneath the guarded insecurities
I finally found the key
Underneath the garments, that's the double D's

[Chorus]
Open your heart, X spots the mark, baby
Don't turn around, make an ass out yourself, baby
Open your heart
What's behind them tig-ol-bitties?

[Verse 2]
I don't mind them little bitty berries
You my Ju-Ju-Be
I don't need nothing to distract me
From this connectivity
You know I see it all the time
The same old shit to me
I just wanna know what's under
That tender titty meat

[Pre-Chorus]
They say the heart is underneath
Underneath the guarded insecurities
I finally found the key (Yes, I did)
Underneath the garments, that's the double D's

[Chorus]
Open your heart, X spots the mark, baby
Don't turn around, make an ass out yourself, baby
Open your heart
What's behind them tig-ol-bitties?

[Bridge]
Yeah, before you go and pop that bottom, baby
Before you go and get butt naked, baby
I know you got a little bit of baggage, baby
Never mind, I'ma look past it
Big cans in the cooler, let me handle it, baby
Two jugs, I'ma start grasping you, baby
Separation between truth and the fake
You can get a new rack for $5K
You can get a rapper by Friday
You gon' have to replace being cheapskate, just save it
Can a nigga squeeze or should I just be safe?
(Yeah, for sure) Tell me what it reads on the expiration date
(Well, I just got them, should be good for about ten years or so)
I know you feel the D when a nigga deep in the hole
But do you feel the peace when I'm sucking them, baby doll?
(Can you fuck me already?)

[Chorus]
Open your heart, baby, X spots the mark, baby
Don't turn around, make an ass out yourself, baby
Open your heart
What's behind them tig-ol-bitties?
Open your heart, baby, X spots the mark, baby
What's behind them tig-ol-bitties?

[Skit]
For me, I can't live in the Northern Hemisphere
I must live back, back into time
Where all these animals, all this sea life, all the oysters, shellfish, crustaceans, everything is part of the smell
Everything has come into the focus of the whole experience

[Verse 1]
Time never cares, if you're there or not there
All you ever needed was a simple plan
But you're doing well, I mean, you're not dead
So let's celebrate while we still can

[Verse 2]
I know what they say, I could give or care
They talk so much on me, I must be doing something right
I saw my son today, in the likeness of a full grown man
So I'll celebrate while I still can

[Chorus]
Ooh, on a clear day, you can see West LA, even downtown
I remember where I couldn't even see the point
Of stepping out the motherfucking house
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
I came to fixing up the tree that farms move
I've came too far

[Verse 3]
How many others have walked the same ground you have?
You'll be wise to pay attention to your old head
I spent the whole day throwin' records in the deep end
So let's celebrate while we still can

[Verse 4]
Captivated, the fruits of my family tree
Where would I be without you?
What would you do without me?
It'd be a bad look talkin' 'bout what could've been
So let's celebrate while we still can

[Chorus]
Ooh, on a clear day, you can see West LA, even downtown
I remember where I couldn't see the point
But now I'm at the point where I got it figured out
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
I came to fixin' up the tree that farms move
I've came too far

[Piano Solo]

[Verse 5]
Do not be concerned about the money in your brother's hand
What's mine is yours
Thought you knew me better than that
I was under the impression that we all want the best of life
So let's celebrate while we still can

[Skit]
The partnership of the, of the board and the body of the fellow that is doing the maneuvers
In the fluent directions with the, with this wave is what interests me
Now chaotic surfing, nervous surfing, and uh, uh, surfing power has its, has its merits
And I, uh, I can—it fascinates me. That's just not my direction
I, I can only speak for myself

[Skit]
I enjoy some of the old and I enjoy the new
And if I can find a balance between it, that's where I find my satisfaction

[Intro: Timan Family Choir & (Anderson .Paak)]
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now (Yeah), keep dreaming

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
I'm on my fifth brew and my rent's due
Sixth and west roof, I can see it all
Hold on to my hand, that's my lil' dude
Look at Kenzo, swaggin' like his paw
One for the occasion and get ya good suit
Fuck your reservation, bitch, I brought 'em all
Look at where you came from, Californication
Since a little baby skating in boogie boards and raiding your
Cookie jar, my radio analog, I wanted them
Nikes, mama got me Lugz (And all)

[Chorus 1: Anderson .Paak & Timan Family Choir]
This one's for all the little dreamers
And the ones who never gave a fuck
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Living room, watching old reruns
And who cares, your daddy couldn't be here?
Mama always kept the cable on
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Living room, watching old reruns

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
One for the occasion, fuck your reservation
Call up all the haters, it's official
Californication, ever since a baby
Radio and the cable, I got the dish, too, and, oh

[Chorus 1: Anderson .Paak & Timan Family Choir]
This one's for all the little dreamers
And the ones who never gave a fuck
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Living room, watching old reruns
And who cares, your daddy couldn't be here?
Mama always kept the cable on
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Living room, watching old reruns

[Bridge: Talib Kweli]
This is the music that you gotta feel
Gave you the truth before I got a deal
No rabbit in a hat, it ain't no magic, ain't no Copperfield
More like a panther, Huey Newton, Bobby Seale
Word to the free lunch, who knew what we would become?
Who would be defunct? Which rumours would be debunked?
Yeah, this is the music that you gotta feel
Yeah, gave you the truth before I got a deal
No rabbit in a hat, it ain't no magic, ain't no Copperfield
More like a panther, Huey Newton, Bobby Seale
Word to the free lunch, who knew what we would become?
Who would be defunct? Which rumours would be debunked?

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Used to be scared of all my fears
'Til I woke up from this nightmare
Now what become of a dream deferred, now until I leave this earth
The music make your speakers burst, I always put my people first
It's deep how when I speak, they say I'm preaching like I lead a church
No proper opposition, competition gonna need a nurse
My job as an artist is making miracles
To show you how to struggle poetic and make it lyrical
Crystallize the thought to make it clear to you
And make the revolution irresistable

[Chorus 1: Anderson .Paak]
This one's for all the little dreamers
And the ones who never gave a fuck
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Living room, watching old reruns
And who cares, your daddy couldn't be here?
Mama always kept the cable on
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Living room, watching old reruns

[Outro]
Oh my gosh, guys, calm down
Stop it

[Skit]
Now, evolution, where's it all going? Is it coming to an end or it it just beginning
There was one fellow who know'd Malibu quite well at a certain time in history
And I doubt if, uh, very few people are able to find these types of conditions again
Due to crowds and controls and much bureaucracy
But there are other areas which are magnificent or treasures of this world
And for somebody with adventure and excitement in their lives, and they have a lot of excitement and adventure
They can find this way of living

[Hook: Kent Jones]
I get it 365, 12 months, 24/7
Gotta get it, I need it steady Fight me

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
You was never round, had to hold it down
We the youngest, we was thuggin’, you was never found
What’s that feelin’? I’m the realest
All ’em nights I had to struggle tryna find some dinner
They don’t really love me, they not really for me
When I die is you gon’ show up to the ceremony?
I just bought a Bentley just to

Bet you Christian Louboutin’ll make her switch religion
I’m not stupid, baby, but the mansion is

[Verse 2: Vado]
Uh, they say in due time, but my watch broke
It‘s a cold world, but we got coats
We grindin’ to make it, we shinin’, they hatin'
We ball 'til we fall, every dime is a flagrant
I’m signed to the pavement, I’m crossin’ em over
I’m backin ’em down, standing tall like a soldier
These players can’t hold us, it’s the winners’ race
Eating with Kent and Ace at a table, no dinner plates
We the best, get it straight! What’s the problem, baby?
Raised outta Harlem, baby, was driving my momma crazy
They ain’t tryna give it, so I gotta go get it, harder than ever to live it

[Bridge: Kent Jones]
Have faith in many but put your trust in nobody
Yeah! I said, have faith in many but put your trust in nobody
Have faith in many but put your faith in nobody
I done been around, halfway round the globe, probably
Still ain’t met nobody that see it picture perfect
We all buy lies, depends on the purchase
You can’t walk a mile in my shoes cause I’m steady runnin’
Like water can’t break, unless it’s by a pregnant woman
So I had to earn life, road to the riches
Wouldn’t change it for the turnpike

[Hook]

Sean Don, whoa
D-Boys
Look

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
All I gotta say is what a year, what a year
I decided now that every year is our year
Aw yeah man, that's 'til we disappear
I'm focused on the near and never what's in the rear
Recently I swear man we've had so many accolades
I realized I ain't sat down, not even on a Saturday
Yeah I'm going over time, O.T like it's TNT
In South America rocking Rio with RiRi
You know that's, stadium status
When you started underground, you gotta make it to the attics
So I'm up in addict Focus, money is the only time I ADD
Going off more than ADT, making power moves like: back, forward, punch, kick, A, B, B
Boy this shit ABC's, shout out Detail, 7-11 we on the road
I'm on the sixth record off the album going gold
Last one woke they ass up like the morning show
I'm tryna make next year the greatest story ever told
Like, shit, goddamn, standing next to Jay and K, like man
Never took an L and I'm out there from where it's hard to make it this far when you this tan
I'm sayin' I'm Lil B with the right wrist
I realized time make money, it's priceless
So don't gas me up bitch, I'm a hybrid
I know you like it, I see the job's done before I see my eyelids
It's getting better every single day, that's what they told me
And I already wasn't fuckin' with the old me

[Chorus: Detail & Pharrell]
It's like I hit the light switch
Woah, yeah

Hop out and roll on 'em
It's like a fresh pair of dice but I'm rolling on they life

Hop out and roll on 'em
(I got the light switch, light switch)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, what's life without risk?
If you take none, that's probably what you gonna get
This year I'm done with crazy hoes
If it's one thing I hate its lazy hoes
Goddamn, if it's two things I hate, it's greedy hoes
One time for my girls that turn theyself into CEOs
Just know that you the finest
I like older girls that realize they got time left
I like young girls, but not girls young-minded
Ones that shine with you but they won't get blinded
We just went around the world in twenty-eight days
Shows selling more tickets than the matinees
Sold out everywhere, bad bitch cheer
All I gotta say is "What a year, what a year"
Up late, two, three, tryna get the mic skills
Riding 'round ATL, shout out my bro Mike-Will
Making sure the fam straight like they like they up in Mike will
Every Mike, Jordan, Tyson, Jackson
Need the, uh, Washingtons, Franklins, Jacksons
Got the crowd packed in, front in, back in
Like oh, please stop comparing me
You starting up a new whip? I'm starting up a charity
While you got new chains, my family out of debt nigga
Yeah, respect last longer than a check nigga
RIP for my ones who couldn't see the day
I really wish they would have saw me get a VMA
I know my grandma ain't here but it's cool cause as long as I'm around she gon' be here in my DNA
I went from broke to breaking records in the city where I live
While I was breaking that down, they broke into the crib
But they can't break the dream shout to the ones I dreamed with
I ain't rich 'til the whole team rich
It's like...

[Chorus: Detail & Pharrell]
I hit the light switch
Woah, yeah
I feel like I hit the light switch (Yeah)
It's like I took my family into a new crib
Then I hit the light switch
I took my whole life and then I hit the light switch (Aww yeah)
So I'ma hop out and roll on 'em (Yeah)
Hop out and roll on 'em
It's like a fresh pair of dice but I'm rolling on they life
I'ma roll on 'em (Yeah, say what?)
Hop out and roll on 'em
(I got the light switch, light switch)

[Outro: Detail]
I got your bills
Pull out the 'Ville
You got the healing
You know you badass
I got the light switch
Baby you know, I got the light switch
Woah

[Intro: Mark Avery]
Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old. Fed up with life and the way things are going, he decides to rob a liquor store. But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart and suddenly his conscience comes into play

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Alright stop, now before you walk in the door
Of this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (But who are you?)
I'm your mothafuckin' conscience!

[Eminem]
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money and run to one of your Aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades

[Dr. Dre]
Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns!

[Eminem]
Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit, are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?

[Dr. Dre]
Man don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right!)
Not over this shit, drop the biscuit (I will!)
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you
(You know what Dre, I don't like yo attitude)

[Hook]
These voices, these voices, I hear them
And when they talk, I follow, I follow
I follow, I follow all these voices

[Interlude: Mark Avery]
Meet Stan, 21 years old. After meeting a young girl at a rave party, things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom. Once again, his conscience comes into play

[Verse 2: Eminem & (Dr. Dre)]
Now listen to me, while you're kissing her cheek
And smearing her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
(Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair)
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair?
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare
'til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie, Kids?)
No but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest!
(Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog and bail

[Hook]

[Interlude: Mark Avery]
Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker. After coming home from a hard day's work, he walks in the door of his trailer park home to find his wife in bed with another man (What the fuck?)

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & (Eminem)]
Alright, calm down, relax, start breathing
(Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheating
While you at work she's with some dude trying to get off
Fuck slitting her throat, cut this bitch's head off!)
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
(What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?)
Alright, Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy

[Eminem & (Dr. Dre)]
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
(What you say?) What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
(I'ma kill you, mothafucka!) Uhh-ahh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK
Coming straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?

[Dr. Dre]
Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that, aw fuck it, what am I saying?
Shoot 'em both Grady, where's your gun at?

[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I messed up tonight, I lost another fight
I still mess up, but I'll just start again
I keep falling down, I keep on hitting the ground
But I always get up now to see what's next

[Pre-Chorus]
Birds don't just fly, they fall down and get up
Nobody learns without getting it wrong

[Chorus]
I won't give up, no, I won't give in
'Til I reach the end and then I'll start again
No, I won't leave, I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail
I won't give up, no, I won't give in
Til I reach the end and then I'll start again
No, I won't leave, I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Try everything
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Try everything
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Look how far you've come, you filled your heart with love
Baby, you've done enough, take a deep breath
Don't beat yourself up, don't need to run so fast
Sometimes we come last, but we did our best

[Chorus]
I won't give up, no, I won't give in
'Til I reach the end and then I'll start again
No, I won't leave, I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail
I won't give up, no, I won't give in
'Til I reach the end and then I'll start again
No, I won't leave, I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail

[Bridge]
I'll keep on making those new mistakes
I'll keep on making them every day
Those new mistakes

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Try everything
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Try everything
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Try everything
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Try everything

Lover you will be stolen from us at the dawn
Lover you will be stolen from us in the morn
Lover conceal me, all of my body, I won't go
Lover you will be stolen from us at the dawn

[Verse 2]
Lover its all me wrapped in a steel sheet flyer
Look in the sky see, inside a jet stream goodbye
Caught in a wind beam, out in the sky stream, mornin'
Lover it's all me, a lonely steel sheet flyer

[Chorus]
My lonely wings are ready for flight
The ocean is breathing between you and I
My lonely wings don't make it right
Wrapped in a steel sheet and ready to fly

[Verse 3]
Lover believe me it won't be easy when I'm gone
Blinder I will be, dead and awake see, I'll mourn
Lover believe me, it's not the TV, it's more
Lover believe me, it won't be easy when I'm gone

[Verse 4]
Lover I'm lonely, wrapped in a steel sheet flyer
Hungry and thirsty, feeling the worst here and tired
My head is dusty, my nose is crusty, this flight
Lover I'm lonely, a lonely steel sheet flyer

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
Lover I'm lonely, wrapped in a steel sheet flyer
Hungry and thirsty, feeling the worst here and tired
My head is dusty, my nose is crusty, this flight

[Chorus]
My lonely wings are ready for flight
The ocean is breathing between you and I
My lonely wings don't make it right
Wrapped in a steel sheet and ready to fly

[Chorus]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman

[Verse 1]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I feel so accomplished

Herzog and Adidas, man, you know they love it
If Nike ain't have Drizzy, man, they would have nothin', woo!
If Nike ain't have Don C, man, they would have nothin', ooh!
But I'm all for the family, tell 'em, "Get your money"
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, they line up for days
Nike out here bad, they can't give shit away
I stuck to my roots, I'm like Jimmy Fallon
I ain't dropped the album but the shoes went platinum (Woo!)
Every time I talk, they say I'm too aggressive
I was out here spazzin', now y'all get the message?!
On the field I'm over-reckless, on my Odell Beckham
2020, I'ma run the whole election, yah!
I've been trending years, y'all a couple days
Yeezy in the house and we just got appraised
Nike, Nike treat employees just like slaves
Gave LeBron a billi' not to run away (You!)
Ten-thousand dollar fur for Nori, I just copped it (You!)
Your baby daddy won't even take your daughter shoppin' (You!)
I done wore designers I won't wear again
Make 'em niggas famous, they get arrogant

[Chorus]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman, ah!
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
(Sonic boom!)

[Verse 2]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, this is pure luxury

Plus Kimoji just shut down the app store, ah!
And we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute
(We did)
Yeah, we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute, ah!
Do anybody feel bad for Bill Cosby?
Did he forget the names just like Steve Harvey? (You!)
Tell Adidas that we need a million in production  (You!)
I done told y'all, all I needed was the infrastructure (Boom!)
Now we hottest in the streets, it ain't no discussion
James Harden, Swaggy P runnin' up the budget (Yoga flame!)
Keep the work at my baby mama's mama's house
I'm a jerk, you need to work, you need to call my spouse
Yeezy, Yeezy, take a picture with me on Rodeo
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I might do my own hotel
Couches, couches, couches, couches, which one should I pick?
I need extra deep, I like my bitches extra thick (Sonic boom!)
Every time I see the news, man it bring me home
Call up DJ Mano, shout out Twilite Tone
We just blessed to be alive, yeah, ain't that the truth?
So let's celebrate the life of Timbuck2
Timbuck2, Timbuck2

[Outro]
Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are, are, are, are, are, are, are

Bitch, I'm the realest, I'm the one million in the house
A B C D E F, bitch, you know that I'm a G
Call over Boss or K-Ci like she know Jodeci

Whatever drugs you on, y'all been on too long
Shit's gone too far
And my bitch say she miss me, I've been gone too long

Rappers ain't rapped in a minute
Sayin' broke is a joke, I ain't laughed in a minute

[Verse 1]
Ugh, she gonna do it for a promise ring
Pussy every night, remember what you promised me?
You my Grammy, all them other hoes nominees

Yeah then maybe you gon' sweat off your Maybelline
One time, two time, three time
Nigga four times, five times, me time
Here I go now, Beast Mode, Oak Town
Then I let her tell her friends, you know how these hoes talk
Might c-walk to the Ghost, see me ghost ride

Always workin', how you find time to drive all them cars?
She wanna tell me how she feel, have a heart to heart
Shorty won't you swing my way, I ain't talkin' golf

Say your ex-nigga hurt, tell him walk it off
One time, two time, three time
Nigga four times, five times, me time

Oh yeah
I see quit your job again
Does it feel bit better
Matter fact it does
I never had time for it anyway
Cause I never really liked my job
Seems like I still don't have time
To do any little thing that I want to do
I can tell you nothing that you think it is
It's a matter of opinion but it's wasted
I can make you feel worthless
But you know your life is worthless
Don't you hate that?
Don't you hate that?
All you can do is rest and rot

Just rot
Just rot
Just rot

I lay in the dirt
Don't want to go inside for dinner

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
The young boy just turned sixteen and I got (Uh)
Six four's and hot bikes that I rock (Uh)
Keep three or four sweeties on my clock (Uh)
But all that swinging in that bikini just make 'em vicious
Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop (Uh)
'Cause you speak in that slang that I talk (Uh)
That sassy tempo with that walk (Uh)
May be the reason that all these teenies may never see me

[Chorus]
Momma you may be three years older but you hot (Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme"
Momma you may be three years older but you hot (Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme"

[Verse 2]
Ma, take a break, let me explain to you (Woo)
What your body got a young boy ready to do (Woo)
If you take a chance to let me put them thangs on you
I could show you why I make them straight A's at school
I'm a hustler, trust my frame and age
Got you thinking that I'm just too young to turn your page
I can picture us switching lanes
In the coupe, with you on the phone screaming my name (Chris!)

[Chorus]
Momma you may be three years older but you hot (Gimme that, hot)
You be talking like you like what I got (Yeah, gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme" (Oh)
Momma you may be three years older but you hot (Hot, gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (Hey, gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac (Ooh)

This what your body's saying (Oh!)

[Chorus]
Momma you may be three years older but you hot (Three years older, gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (Oh, gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme" (You could be in the back, yeah)
Momma you may be three years older but you hot (Ooh, gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (Yeah, gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme"

[Outro]

Shoutout to the Zone, 1 to the 2 to the 3 to the 4

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Take a walk
Before it gets dark
Little angel
There's no need to worry
Shouldn't be too painful
At last, I see the roses
West bound on a cold train
I'm headed home for the closing

[Verse 2]
Take a walk
Before it gets dark
There's no need to worry
Shouldn't be too painful
At last, I see the roses
West bound on a cold train
I'm headed home for the closing

[Outro]
Drifting towards the ocean
Some place where I can lay my head down
Are closing

[Verse 1]
I know something's very wrong
The pulse returns the prodigal sons
The blackout hearts, the flowered news
With skull designs upon my shoes

[Chorus]
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away

[Verse 2]
Seeing more and feeling less
Saying no but meaning yes
This is all I ever meant
That's the message that I sent

[Chorus]
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away

[Verse 1]
I know something's very wrong
The pulse returns the prodigal sons
The blackout hearts, the flowered news
With skull designs upon my shoes

[Chorus]
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away

[Verse 1]
Cash girls suffer me, I’ve got no enemies
I’m walking down
It’s nothing to me
It’s nothing to see
If I'll never see the English evergreens I’m running to
It’s nothing to me
It’s nothing to see

[Chorus 1]
I’m dying to
Push their backs against the grain
And fool them all again and again
I’m trying to
We bitches tear our magazines
Those oligarchs with foaming mouths come
Now and then
Can’t believe for just one second I’m forgetting you
I’m trying to
I’m dying to

[Verse 2]
Dollar days, survival sex
Honour stretching tails to necks
I’m falling down
It’s nothing to me
It’s nothing to see
If I'll never see the English evergreens I’m running to
It’s nothing to me
It’s nothing to see

[Chorus 2]
I’m dying to
Push their backs against the grain
And fool them all again and again
I’m trying to
It’s all gone wrong but on and on
The bitter nerve ends never end
I’m falling down
Don’t believe for just one second I’m forgetting you
I’m trying to
I’m dying to

[Outro]
I’m trying to
I’m dying to
I’m trying to
I’m dying to
I’m trying to
I’m dying to
I’m trying to
I’m dying to

[Intro]
Yeah, bitch. I ain't spit bars in a minute, I'm kinda rusty. I got my yorkie in here with me, you feel me. I paid $1500 for it. Not a cheap dog, not cheap at all. Yeah, bitch

[Verse 1]
When the fuck did we get this high, I can't remember
Cold, middle of the summer feeling like the winter
Shorty wanna roll these trees for the kid cause I'm a winner
Watchin' for the enemies but we don't speak it over dinner, that's the key to living
Niggas wanna talk some beef, but be too weak to mention
They lie around me and cutting corners with cheap decisions
I'm just a mortal man and I ain't tryna be pretentious
But young nigga got the glow like Chief Keef is with him
Float like the ocean, gold fish sleepin' with him, don't wanna be the victim
Ain't got no hatred in my heart but jealous niggas I despise I'm under pressuring
You could see aggression in these eyes, the world deceptive in it lies
Depression I'm just pressing through the slime

[?] I'm pressing their lines, I'm fine
Too raw for these niggas on their swaggy shit
Like KG told Charlie, cancerous

[Hook]
I'm just countin' my cash
My momma sayin' that I'm living too fast
And yeah I'm doing all the shit but no I don't wanna crash
I'm just a good guy but I'm doin' it bad

[Verse 2]
I used to roll the Corolla before I blowed up
Throw my 

[?] Nova Scotia, boulders
Cold as my ex-hoes exposed to my shoulder
I was on the road when you were stuffing dope in joint rollers
Too young to leave you sober
And I ain't tryna talk unless money or Motorola, save the chatter nigga
Running 'cross burning bridges, scaling these broken ladders nigga
Gossip all you want, your opinions ain't never mattered nigga
Faded pen and records out of my nana's house
Cause I was either pen and pad or black and pulling hammers out
Another dumb nigga not about to understand my route
I know my worth, I'm never standing out
Fuck what you handing out
What you talking ain't impressive to me
I lost my uncle wrong timing, learned some lessons through it
This shit is soulful, can't price check a progressive movement
From precious ruins and heavy pressure we pressin' through it
Won't be depressed if I lose my breath in this revolution
Evrey step I'm giving my best with my chest protruding
But like Aaliyah said, we need a resolution
And I think being honest is the best solution

[Hook]
I'm just countin' my cash
My momma sayin' that I'm living too fast
And yeah I'm doing all the shit but no I don't wanna crash
I'm just a good guy but I'm doin' it bad

[Outro]
You ain't even know my time was coming
I said you ain't even know my time was coming
You ain't even know my time was coming, yeah
You ain't even know my time was coming, yeah

[Verse 1]
Cheena so sound, so titi up this malchick, say
Party up moodge, nanti vellocet round on Tuesday
Real bad dizzy snatch making all the omies mad - Thursday
Popo blind to the polly in the hole by Friday

[Bridge]
Where the fuck did Monday go?
I'm cold to this pig and pug show
I'm sittin' in the chestnut tree
Who the fuck's gonna mess with me?

[Chorus]
Girl loves me (Hey, cheena)
Girl loves me
Girl loves me (Hey, cheena)
Girl loves me

[Bridge]
Where the fuck did Monday go?
(Go, go, go, go, go, go, go)
I'm cold to this pig and pug show
(Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go)
Where the fuck did Monday go?
(Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go)

[Verse 2]
You viddy at the cheena
Choodesny with the red rot
Libbilubbing litso-fitso
Devotchka watch her garbles
Spatchko at the rozz-shop
Split a ded from his deng deng
Viddy viddy at the cheena

[Chorus]
Girl loves me (Hey, cheena)
Girl loves me
Girl loves me (Hey, cheena)
Girl loves me
Girl loves me (Hey, cheena)
Girl loves me

[Refrain]
Where the fuck did Monday go?
Where the fuck did Monday go?
Where the fuck did Monday go?

[Chorus]
Girl loves me (Hey, cheena)
Girl loves me
Girl loves me (Hey, cheena)
Girl loves me

[Verse 1]
I guess how much I love you
I left my house and I don't know
I don't know how nice meeting
I guess how much I love you

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]

[Hook]
The closer that you get
The closer that you get to me
That's just a road that gon' hurt you
Hurt you
I know I said some shit
I know I said some shit I don't mean
But, girl, we know that's what words do
Words do
Your body says it first, (your body says it first)
So when you open up your lips to speak
Just know I already heard you
Heard you
I told you I ain't shit
But still you wanna be with me
We both know I don't deserve you
I'm only gon' hurt you

[Verse]
I'm not gon' change for you, you can't fix me cause I'm not broken
Before you develop feelings, let's put the real in the open
You could give me your heart, that still don't mean that I own it
It's like walking the tightrope between logic and our emotions
I don't know why the story's always the same
Two people fall in love 'til they go separate ways
I'm savage by nature, so blame my creator
So much pussy thrown at me I need a coordinator
Eh, every girl thinks she's the 100th girl I done slept with
When I ain't even got enough time to check all my messages
Look, I grew up around woman
So I never felt the need to rush and get settled down with 'em
I know, I don't speak for all men, I speak for me
So you don't commit your life to someone who ain't gon' keep it a G
Embrace the good, the bad, the ugly
'Cause there's certain shit in this man that just can't adjusted
I know, the truth is like alcohol
You think you can handle it 'til you can't stand at all
Tryna manage with a damaged heart
If every nigga ain't shit, then really who's the fault?
We both know what we here to do
I guess my bluntness is offending you
I guess I'm young and hypocritical
I want the sex but not the spiritual residue
And you want something magical
Cartoon and fairytales, conditioning what come natural
Out of touch with the actual, using sex as collateral
Confusion occurs when one's own beliefs are incompatible

[Bridge]
Fights all the time, you say you fine
I know you lyin', it's on your mind
And I ain't blind, I often find
You don't have to cut the knot, just untie the line

[Hook]
The closer that you get
The closer that you get to me
That's just a road that gon' hurt you
Hurt you
I know I said some shit
I know I said some shit I don't mean
But, girl, we know that's what words do
Words do
Your body says it first, (your body says it first)
So when you open up your lips to speak
Just know I already heard you
Heard you
I told you I ain't shit
But still you wanna be with me
We both know I don't deserve you
I'm only gon' hurt you

[Intro: Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
Let me tell you a little story
Hey girl, love me

[Verse 1: Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
In the middle of a cold dark night
I heard a sound and I thought to myself, "What was that?"
I got up and checked
It was you walking out my door
You said you loved me just moments before
Why'd you lie?
What the heck?

[Chorus: Post Malone as Leon DeChino & Jason Stokes as Jazzy Eff]
Our love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
My heart was beating like a very fast drum
You looked at me and said I'm not number one
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?

[Interlude: Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
Let me introduce you to my friend, Jazzy Eff

[Verse 2: Jason Stokes as Jazzy Eff &  Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
Don't you know my friend would do anything?
He would sing to you from winter to spring
You betrayed him
You should go away
He really, really, really misses you bad (Yes he does)
He remembers all the times that y'all had
He's crying (I'm crying)
That's not okay

[Chorus: Post Malone as Leon DeChino & Jason Stokes as Jazzy Eff]
Our love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
My heart was beating like a very fast drum
You looked at me and said I'm not number one
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?

[Bridge: Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
Stop, girl, what have you done?
You used to be sweet just like bubblegum
Now you are no fun
You suck, you broke my heart
Stop, girl, what have you done?
You used to be sweet just like bubblegum
Now you are no fun
You suck, you broke my heart

[Chorus: Post Malone as Leon DeChino & Jason Stokes as Jazzy Eff]
Our love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
My heart was beating like a very fast drum
You looked at me and said I'm not number one
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?

[Outro: Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
So tell me, why, girl? Come on
Hello, fans, this is Father John Misty. Whether you're snorting rails of Tide off priceless Matisse Cut-Outs or stuck at home 'cause of your dismal Uber rating, my customized mixtape is guaranteed to be 100% Ed Sheeran. That's Ed Sheeran, all the time, on Father John Misty Radio

[Verse 1]
Life is like a fairground ride
Up and up, and blinded by the lights
Carousel keeps spinning 'round, faster and faster
But I don't ever want to stop
Don't want to get my bubble popped
I'm losing all reality, I don't care
But now I'm standing on my own
And I'm in someone else's clothes
The darkness is a gaping hole, keeps going under
Thought this was a good idea
Thought that I could have no fears
My body is in overload
Let me go

[Chorus]
Felt like flying
Now I'm crying
But oh, what the hell did I get myself into?
What the hell did I get myself into?
What the hell, what the hell?
Woah-a-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I wish that I had a time machine
I could turn up all of the TV screens
I would keep running, and running away
Further and further every day
And now I'm on my own
Friends keep trying to call my phone
I told them that I'd never change, I was wrong

[Chorus]
Felt like flying
Now I'm crying
But oh, what the hell did I get myself into?
What the hell did I get myself into?
What the hell, what the hell?
Woah-a-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Somebody get me back into reality
Somebody pull me back under
I kinda like it up here in the galaxy
Hiding, I will not be found, found
Tears of crystal fall down from my face
Losing my mind, losing my mind
You got my heart
I'm gone

[Chorus]
Felt like flying
Now I'm crying
But oh, what the hell did I get myself into?
What the hell did I get myself into?
What the hell, what the hell?
Woah-a-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
What the hell, what the hell?
What the hell?
What the hell, what the hell?
What the hell, hell?

[Intro]
Yeah, you did me wrong, you did me wrong, Keisha
All I ever wanted was a little piece of your time
Oh, Keisha, did me wrong, did me wrong
And you know you did

[Verse]
God didn't make this time for us to waste it
Baby, he just made his time and came to us to pace it
Baby, he just gave you dreams, girl, so you could chase 'em
Baby, he just gave you me, girl, so you ain't basic
Baby, you got some problems you need to tend to
Baby, you got it obvious, you got issues
Maybe you need to keep it real with yourself
Instead of ridin' around in that black nine-five
On 2 with the tint on the windows
Hope you know I can see what you're in though
When you're drivin' by, watch you eye to eye
I know you see it, ooh Keisha, you know you did it
This love girl, you know you quit it
It's over, I know it's over, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause one minute you're down, down and you committed
Next thing you're down, out and you don't get it
I ain't holdin' you down, down on love
Unless you're down, down on love
'Cause one minute you're down, down and you committed
Next thing you're down, out and you don't get it
I ain't holdin' you down, down on love
Unless you're down, down on love

[Verse 1]
I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 2]
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair (No fair)
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes (Those ocean eyes)
I'm scared (I'm scared)
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Bridge]

You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

Tory: Man, I appreciate it, man, shit
Tory's Friend: What you need to do, my nigga is go outside, nigga, get a bitch, nigga, get something, nigga, go cheat or something like Keisha said

[Verse 1]
Two tears in a bucket, I cry with you, agh!
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight, I freeze up when I re-up
See, I barely have patience, and you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it? Went to work for it
See, a nine-to-five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came, checks didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth, I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all, but if I can shortcut my success
Corvettes by tomorrow, ugh!

[Hook]
Why so sad? Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have, blue faces
I hit the bank today and tell 'em color me bad, blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down

[Verse 2]
My homegirl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn
Intuition got a Black woman wishin'
She saying this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh, the anticipation, hoping you could make it
Women don't prosper chasin' education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
Can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But ain't no money like fast money
Even today, I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them

[Hook]
But why I'm so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have, blue faces (Faces)
I hit the bank today and tell 'em, color me bad, blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down, to the top

[Bridge]
I love God, I love speed
I love drank, I love mead
I love oceans in the deep
I love women, I love me
I love God
Ugh! But I’m scared of godspeeeeeeed
Sometimes

[Verse 3]
I wrote this song
Looking at a broke home, maybe (Broke home, maybe)
You know the poverty-stricken
The little broke boy and babies (Broke boy and babies)
Somebody say "Kendrick American, they sho’ is crazy"
And I said “Why?”
Then he looked me in the eye
And said "Homie, you're messed up
You’re banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
Never been through 'ish, you’re crying hysterical
You settle for everything, complain about everything
YSay you sold crack, my world amphetamine
Your projects ain’t it, I live in a hut
You're living to keep warm, I'm living to pay rent
I paid my way through, praying to Allah
You played your way through, dealing with wi-fi
Bull-'ishing yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing go for the ones you came with
We all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope, huh?
These days ain’t no compromise, ugh
Your pain ain’t mines half the time, ugh
A brand new excuse ain’t nothing to me
See, I made my moves with shackled feet"

[Interlude]
Cape Town, Cape Town
Cape Town, Cape Town
Caaaaaaaaape Town
Cape Town, Cape Town
Ugh!

Morning with the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrrt-skrrt!

So many plays on me, I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I react
Me and Top is like a Kobe-and-Phil
A father figure; play with him, you get killed
Play with me and he-a kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we juugin’ like that
Act of violence, yeah, we juugin’ like that
I did a lot of dumb things in my past
Lord forgive me, hoping I don't relapse
Dave just bought a new 9-11
Almost thought I’d seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Moosa got his son dripping in gold
Me, I'm about to let my hair down to hoes
Ali 'bout to let his hair down to hoes
Top billing, that’s a million a show
Might blow the whole no-whammy on Soul
Might tell Obama, "Be more like Punch"
Sounwave got a Grammy this year
Mackwop, bet he do what he want
Level two, level two, no, I’m not done
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
I could put a rapper on life support
Guaranteed, something that none of you want
Ten homies down and they all serving life
Ward is like twenty-five hundred a month
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
You ain’t got, you ain’t got
You ain’t got, you ain’t got
Tell me that, tell me that that I'm the one
You ain’t got, you ain’t got, you ain’t got
You ain’t got tell me that, what! I’m the one
Yes, I’m the one!

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Real friends, how many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' at the communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my...

[Chorus: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was (Was)
Couldn't tell you how old your son is (Is)
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg (Dawg)
Plus I already got one kid (Kid)
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit? (Shit)
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with (With)
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit (Shit)
'Cause everybody got 'em that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg, I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be

[Verse 3: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Lookin' for real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends, 'til the reel end
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin (Yeah yeah)
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, "What's up, fam? Hope you good"
You say, "I'm good, I'm great," the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
Real friends
Huh?

[Chorus: Kanye West,  Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
Uh, I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him

[Intro]
Hey, yeah, I like this right here

Bom, ba-dum bum, ba-da-da-da-da (Mr.)

Now somebody, anybody, everybody, say

[Verse 1]
Your boy picked up a residency in Vegas
Making history, performing amongst the greatest
My father brought boats over in the 80s
Now I godfather my own ship, man, it's crazy
This is all by design, 100 million and I'm still on the grind
8 billion views and I'm still on the climb
Cut a deal with Florida, now Miami's all mine
I'm free, baby, bring the beat, baby
Let me show you how a living legend live, baby
Let's be free, baby, and cruise the world
Are you with it, girl?

[Chorus]
I'm free to do what I want and have a good time
Now somebody, anybody, everybody, say
'Cause I'm free to do what I want and have a good time
Now somebody, anybody, everybody, say

[Verse 2]
Went from a poor kid to a well-known all around the globe world-class citizen
Man, I payed my dues and earned my stripes
Took all the wrong in my life and I made it right
Feel free, do whatever you want whenever you want with whoever you want
Feel free, who cares what they say?
Just live your life 'cause we don't live twice
Feel free, have the time of our lives, let's all get wild tonight
Feel free, get on the ship and cruise the world
Are you with it, girl?

[Chorus]
I'm free to do what I want and have a good time
Now somebody, anybody, everybody, say
'Cause I'm free to do what I want and have a good time
Now somebody, anybody, everybody, say

[Bridge]
Miami, we were born to be free

China, let's escape and feel free, yeah
Mexico, we were born to be free

[Intro: Johnny "Guitar" Watson & Junie Morrison]
La-di-da-da-a, da-a (I like this flavor)
La-da-da-da-di-da-da-a, la-a (La-a, la-a, la-a)
Let me tell you, I'm out here
From a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far

[Chorus: Kanye West, Junie Morrison & Ghostface Killah]
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more (Los Angeles)
Please (Shake that body, party that bod-)
Please (Shake that body, party that bod-)
Please (Shake that body, party that body)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Kanye West]
Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"
Uhm—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl in North Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, "Spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards"
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, "K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy"

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Scary, scary
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I remember Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A thirty-eight-year-old eight-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me! (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money, money, money!)
Big, big money (Money, money, money!)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker!

[Bridge: Larry Graham]
I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know can take your pla-, pla-, pla-

[Chorus: Kanye West, Junie Morrison & Ghostface Killah]
Please, no more parties in L.A. (Shake that body, party that body)
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh (Shake that body, party that body)
No more parties in L.A. (Los Angeles)
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh

[Outro: Junie Morrison]
Let me tell you, I'm out here from a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
They say that I'm the one
And you, you are the prototype
You might have the ears of sound
But you already know who they like
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody to hold you real tight
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody tell 'em he's the prototype

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I am the truth, no lie about it
Bring my testimony when I walk in that booth
Walking the thin line between love and hate, I defend mines
Join them when it comes to their crunch time, I never fold
I love pressure, that's why I apply so much on niggas thinking they better
I am a clutch shooter, I am a sharp shooter
And it's great enough to hear the butterfly moving
Follow me moving through these ghetto streets and school I say fuck retarded sweep
Walk into school the chief right there tried to talk at me
In the midst of Piru and natty Blood beef
Shall we hesitate to walk down 

[?]
That 10-grade summer we had death right in front of us
Then leave the house without kissing our mamas
The new Jordans came out, but we didn't get them
The color haunt them to get too much attention
Damn it I liked it thoughs
Pac was talking 'bout the concrete rose
I never seen one till I looked in the mirror
There go, hehe, that's the flow right there
You should use it, that's what my conscience said then I hopefully abused it, huh
I am the lyrics and the music, y'all rapping note for the beat
I let the instrumentals listen to me
I listen for heat, my ears can hear fire
I pierce through the flame like barbed wire breaking up concrete
And I ain't thinking 'bout no rap beef
Niggas is getting killed throughout the week, that's every day
Catchin' bullets like an umpire
We tried to stay home but still ain't safe
That's baseball tactics, retaliation back and forth like tennis rackets, we used to it
Who can circle 'round the block the fasters
If you can do it, think you know why it becomes a practice
We worked it out like barely total
Cuz shit happens

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody to hold you real tight
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody tell 'em he's the prototype

[Verse 2: Punch]
I ain't even gotta rap but let them young boys get ya
Paint a perfect picture like I'm rhyming only scripture
I'm nice, ice water veins, it's pure no filter
Who you get your style from, it seem real familiar like I heard it before
But reincarnation is a blind man's theory
So I ain't going for it, na uh
I ain't having it, you getting to board it
Like an unfair mother, my child you gon suffer
To you acknowledge to whom gave you life through knowledge
It's higher learning, I'm taking dudes through college
The prototype for the flows you like
I'm surgical on the mic, I cut you up somethin' nice
Get out the pocket, I'm sending them skyrockets right through your minds
Optic popping out your eye sockets, ah
Excites a riot every time I'm rhyming
In accordance with the snare I got impeccable time, Junior

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
They say that I'm the one
And you, you are the prototype
You might have the ears of sound
But you already know who they like
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody to hold you real tight
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody tell 'em he's the prototype

[Verse 1: Justus, Dr. Dre, Victoria Monet, Dr. Dre, Victoria Monet & Justus]
They've been wondering if I'm gon' show
Shit, you already know-ow-ow-ow
Where you been? Where you at? Where you headed?
This shit started to disappear, oh no-o-o-o
I'm right here, yeah
Shit, right back to the basics
Sound like I'm right back in the basement
Tryna put my neighborhood on
Six in the morning (Yeah, six in the morning)
Until six in the morning (Best believe I'm on it)
Man I'm working so hard
When the check hit the bank, shit, I ain't even notice
I live in the future
I'm blind to the moment
I, I, you ain't gotta say
Oh you ain't gotta lay around, we own it

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre, Dr. Dre & Victoria Monet, Justus]
And I remember when I was young, just a front runner
I was fucking with them drums like every summer
Homies couldn't make it out the hood, make a nigga wonder
But I couldn't let Compton take a nigga under
No way, no how, can't stop
Had, bigger dreams for this hip-hop
I'm happy, it was music and not Ziplocs
And now we, bringing crowds like it's Woodstock
I might as well wipe down the crown I done put up in the attic
I don't play around, lotta niggas coming through the door
Not too many stay around
Lot of artists made it, yeah, god damn man I made a sound
Oh you ain't never seen a legend do it? Hold up, homie wait around
I've been on the verge since a nigga put it down
And if we talking numbers, fuck Billboard charts
So they can start with the bank accounts

[Hook: Victoria Monét & Dr. Dre]
I've been away
But I see y'all still ain't catch us
Anything you do can't impress us
I won't let up on it
They gonna say
Anything because they hate us
And the fact that they can't break us
I will never let up
I'm going, yeah I'm going
(I'm going, better believe I'm going) Ohh
(I'm going) Ohh
It's time to get back to business

[Verse 3: T.I.]
This shit realer than rap
Somewhere trapped where you can find me at
Got thirteen in my strap
And I keep this bitch with me whatever town we at
I'm killing these niggas, was never feeling these niggas
Went from a million to ten figures I gross
Getting back to the business and in the back of a Bentley
I'm thinking, "Damn how far can I go?"
Well, if my nigga Dre can get a bill
That let me know that it's hope for a nigga still
And many more showing love for my art form
When the ATL, the trap shit is on board, hold up (Bankhead!)
Think they gave the wrong nigga money when they let me in
If it wasn't meant for me, they shouldn't have let me sit
The explanation for all the devilish shit we did
I'm grinding, handling my business, bitch!

[Outro: Sly Piper & T.I.]
So many miles in the air
Pardon me, I'm standing on my paper
Up, up and away-er
One way ticket to the ozone layer
Don't you wanna roll where there ain't no mid around?
Take you to another atmosphere, smoke this
Smoke this (Roll it up, roll it up, get a lighter)
Smoke this (Roll it up, roll it up, get a lighter)
I can change your atmosphere
I can change your atmosphere
Get your girl to feel my Johnson (Roll it up)
Smoke this (Break it down, roll it up, get a lighter)
Smoke this (Roll it up, get a lighter)

[Intro]
True story (Woo)

[Verse 1]
Attention, my baby's comin' over
I'ma need everyone to go
Take what you need and get to steppin'
No, you don't need to wait up
Traffic, I hear it's kinda crazy
More time for me to clean up
She might think there is something shady
Really, seriously, you need to hurry up
If you only knew about the way she drive
You would understand, I ain't fucking around
If she come through the front door, you gotta hide
Gotta hide, she be like

[Chorus]
Who this bitch all up in my house?
Why she hiding behind the couch?
Ho don't know me, no, you don't know me
No, don't get up, fuck around and I'ma lay you out (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
She like, who this bitch all up in my house? (Yeah)
Why she hiding behind the couch? (Yeah)
Ho don't know me, no, you don't know me

Who this? Who this is?
Who this? (Ah, ah) Who this is?
Who this? Who this is, yeah?
Who this? (Ah, ah) Who this is, yeah?

[Verse 2]
Jump, jump, jump out the way (Ayy)
Jump, jump out the place (Ayy)
If she pull a blade and point it at me
I might catch a case (Ayy)
Baby, I know I was wrong
That's the whole reason I'm singing this song (Ayy)
Can we all get along, get along, get along?
I know you trippin' and pointin' them fingers
What if I told you that this was my sister (Woo, damn)
Trapped in the closet? (Ayy) but it ain't
Lying trying to stall her so that she can get away
What she say?

[Chorus]
Who this bitch all up in my house? (Who that bitch?)
Why she hiding behind the couch? (Please don't hurt her now)
Ho don't know me, no, you don't know me (Know me)
No, don't get up (Hey), fuck around (Hey) and I'ma lay you out (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Who this, who this, who this is?

Why she hiding behind the couch? (Yeah, oh, no, no, no)
Ho don't know me, no, you don't know me
No, don't get up (Hey), fuck around and I'ma lay you out (Out)
She like, who this? What's that bitch name?
Who this is? What's her name?

Who this is? What's her name?
Who this? What's that bitch name?
Who this is? Yeah, tell me her name
Who this? What's that bitch name?
Who this? What's that bitch name? (Ow!)

[Verse 3]
Not the regular predicament
Can't even play like I'm innocent
Every night I fuck a different bitch
I'm the man, you the woman, it's different
You fuckin' niggas for fame (Wow)
Bitches heartin' on my Instagram
I see that look on her face
Know she gon' fuck her up, I'ma just pop a Xan'
I'm under pressure
Came into here, she gon' leave in a stretcher
I shouldn't have let her
I shoulda known better, she gon' teach me a lesson
She a lethal weapon with the .45 with the compressor
Don't pull it, don't pull it, don't pull it
Blood all over the wall and dresser
And if I have the chance would I save her life?
If I never cheated, she wouldn't have died
No, I don't see no soul, only hear her cry
Literally thinking that I'm dead wrong
What she say?

[Chorus]
Who this bitch all up in my house? (Ooh, who is? Yeah)
Why she hiding behind the couch? (Couch)
Ho don't know me, no, you don't know me (Don't know me, oh)
No, don't get up, fuck around and I'ma lay you out (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
She like who's this bitch all up in my house?
Whats her name? Whats her name? (Yeah) Ooh
Why she hiding behind the couch? (Was gonna fuck her 'fore you came, ha)
Ho don't know me, no, you don't know me
No, don't get up, fuck around and I'ma lay you out (Lay you out, bow!)
She like, who this? Who this is?
Then she said, who this? (Ah, ah, ha) Who this is?
Them she said, who this? Who this is, yeah? (Yeah)
Who this? (Ah, ah, ha) Who this is, yeah? (Hey!)

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I ain't perfect, the way I'm treating you
You don't deserve it

She got too many people in her ear, I don't like that
Fighting you, it ain't worth it (Oh no)
'Cause I always lose
Go to hell with all the games (All games)
The decision that you made, you've given up

[Chorus]
Mama warned me 'bout someone like you
Feel like a goddamn fool, playing with my heart, you tried
I'll never regret us, I guess it's better
Arguing, we fed up, tired and jealous
Making your life better by putting my bread up
Give up the battle just to escape your love
Oh-oh, ooh (Oh)
Oh, ooh (Oh), ooh
Give up the battle just to escape your love

[Verse 2]
Party every weekend, I say fuck the club
We too busy beefin', I think you been cheatin'

Fighting you, it ain't worth it (Oh no)
'Cause I always lose
Girl, to hell with all the games (All games)
The decisions that you made, you've given up

[Chorus]
Mama warned me 'bout someone like you

Cause I'm a boy

When she's near, things become so clear
I need she, oh and she needs me

Please I need time, I know I'll be fine
Cause I'm a boy X4

[Verse 1]
I said I'm on to that next shit
You lookin' at the bestest
Married to the game
Treat you niggas like my step-kids
Pull up in that Porsche
Niggas feel nausea
Didn't write the rules, but my status like the arthur
Just crashed the Range, so I pulled the Bent out
Prolly gettin' brains, chillin' in my Penthouse
Slackin' on ya mackin', and I'm 'bout to lay my pimp down
Christian Louboutin, red bottom come in men's now
On to the next one, skinny jeans fit in
Pull up to these shows, and these hoes know to get in
Said they like my fitted clothes down to my split ends
But little do she know, I got a big ego
Automatic weapon, need to order a protection
Killing feelings on these records
So my charges is molesting
And assault with deadly weapons got these rappers feeling threatened
Ain't a hip hop veteran, I'm a hip hop felon

[Verse 2]
I need a crib by the mountains
Chest look house lit
Limbs get frostbit
Brand new outfits
If you less fortunate, you really ain't about shit
So much cribs, a nigga friends got to house sit
So much money, can't weigh it by the ounce shit
Weigh it by the pound shit, too much to count shit
Paparazzi taking pictures
Newspaper topics, magazines gossip
Villa in the tropics
Rockstar pop shit, made by toxic
Inside hot pink, outside gothic
Rag-top roof made of fishnet stockings
Black candy paint look fingernail polish

[Verse 3]
No one in this sight has swag like I do
Church with this verse, I'mma hit em with the gospel
Hit em with the rifle, I'm higher than the Eiffel Tower
Hustle harder, snow, sleet, showers
Age worry about who's hot and who's hotter
Like crabs in the barrel tryna pull you to the bottom
You get em, I got em
Point him out, I spot em
Red dot em, I shot em
I hide em, you find him
Roll to the club, and I order gold bottles
Shawty get low, but I'm no Flo-rida
And this 6-4 spokes like a lowrider
The coups so special, you could call it mo-rida
But I'm a known rider, and I'm a provider
Black on black Bent, fire like the Ghost Rider
Don't need a ghostwriter because my flow's tighter
Your careers nose diving, I'mma pull an allnighter
So hood rich, Hollywood bitch want me
Don't look hood but a hood bitch love me
Hood niggas hate Hollywood niggas hate me
Prolly why I never keep the burner off safety
You could never ugh, you should never try to play me
On a scale of one-to-ten, sick is what they rate me
No homo, but these labels wanna rape me
I tell em four words:
Fuck you. Pay me

[Verse 1]
Somebody told me once that pain is a game we all gotta play
Then why am I in overtime and sudden death every other day
I know that for the good of life there's a price we all gotta pay
But I'll pay till I'm poor and I still don't know what it is to have a good day, yeah

Since everybody knows what it is that I need to do
Well do me a favor, let me worry bout me and you worry bout you

[Chorus:]
I don't need no one to put me down
I'm on the ground, can't get no lower
And I don't need no one to hang around and make me frown just makes me look older
And I don't need no one to black my eye and tell me lies
Don't wanna cry over nobody else
No no no no I can do bad all by myself

[Verse 2]
Somebody told me once that running from the rain don't make no sense
I had my own dark cloud for awhile now, it goes where ever I'm going, yeah
They're telling me the grass just might be greener on the other side
But I don't wanna take a chance on dirt when I got grass even though the grass has died
Oh since everybody knows what it is that I need to do
Well do me a favor, let me worry bout me and you worry bout you

[Chorus:]
I don't need no one to put me down
I'm on the ground, can't get no lower
And I don't need no one to hang around and make me frown just makes me look older
And I don't need no one to black my eye and tell me lies
Don't wanna cry over nobody else
No no no no I can do bad all by myself

[Bridge:]
Don't waste time feeling bad for me
I didn't ask you for your sympathy
No I know God is watching over me
So I guess this is where I'm suppose to be
Ohh yes

[Chorus:]
I don't need no one to put me down
I'm on the ground, can't get no lower
And I don't need no one to hang around and make me frown just makes me look older
And I don't need no one to black my eye and tell me lies
Don't wanna cry over nobody else
No no no no I can do bad all by myself
(Shh)
She's laying back feeling low
I know how I put her there
Always out running around
I never showed her how I cared

But she needs my love
And it's me she's thinking of
I know that it wasn't me
But it's the man that I'm gonna be
That's what she needs

Love is only a feeling
Love is only a feeling
Love is only a feeling
Love is only a feeling
As a kid, having a mentor was vital to me. Always being there when it counted allowed me to make some of the most important decisions while growing up. So it's only right that I mentor a younger person with the same wisdom that was given to me. If it helps the next kid become a better person in life, I will forever be aware of my influence and pay it forward. I look where I'm at today and realize that most of my success is owed to the mentors that was in my life.

I sat down with President Barack Obama and shared the same views. Topics concerning the inner cities, the problem, the solutions and furthermore embracing the youth, both being aware that mentoring saves lives. Sometimes I reflect and think back, "Where would I be if I didn't had the presence of an older acquaintance telling me what's right and what’s wrong?" Telling me the pros and cons of every move I was about to make. Telling me the best way to plan success for my future. Join me in paying it forward. Support My Brother's Keeper by being a mentor in real life.

(Verse 1)
Young nigga came through and he bought a deuce
I'm a kick it for him try to take it through the roof
A nigga test me and he said I'm food
But these chopper bullets are hard to chew (fuck you)
Tighter than a Jew, got a bitch from Peru
And I'm always out of town so keep me in the loop
Salute me or shoot me or move me nigga my young niggas got extendo's too
Bullets hitting windows, limo's, bimbo's
I'm the type of nigga put a tag on your tempo
And my new best friend is my FN and we are not friends so don't pretend-o
Pulling up slow with the lights so low
Get caught probably never see the sun no more
Can't even do a show without a gun no more
Make ya say this rap shit ain't fun no more

(Hook)
There's something weird about ya (There's something weird about ya)
I just can't put my finger on it (I just can't put my finger on it)
You ain't like everybody (You ain't act like everybody)

Niggas ain't seen the shit I saw
You the type of nigga that'll call the law
I'm the type of nigga that will break your jaw
Ride out with your baby ma
Nigga is you crazy, bruh?
Calling me about your lady, bruh?
Must want to go to Grady, huh?
My temp fade so crazy wavy
I used to trap at Mountain Park
I used to stand at Sadie's (Sadie's)
Selling dope at Gresham Housing
And I didn't even have a car
She said she knows me and I'm not no star
But why she come in and didn't wear no bra?
Why she with me and didn't wear no drawers?
Because she never rolled in a Bentley with a chauffeur

(Hook)
There's something weird about ya (There's something weird about ya)
I just can't put my finger on it (I just can't put my finger on it)
You ain't like everybody (You ain't act like everybody)
And that's that shit that make me want ya (That's that shit that make me want ya)

She fuck with errbody (Shawty fuck with errbody)

Crying up above, I'm just here to take you away
(You away, you away)
Don't worry 'bout a thing, I'm just focused on you today
(You today, yeah, oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
You're laid out, you were raised up in a poor town
Roll up, baby, roll up
So hard to leave, but I know I gotta go now
Paris and London (On top of the world)
Baby, we're so down (Will you be my girl?)
Something I wanna say
Yeah, you know I'll be there

[Chorus]
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close, babe, close to my heart
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close, babe, close to my heart

[Verse 2]
I see my phone ring, hope it's you, babe
You sent me a picture
Well, I sent one too
I'm just tryna keep this love on track
Oh babe, I got your heart and I won't give it back

[Pre-Chorus]
You're laid out, you were raised up in a poor town
Roll up, baby, roll up
So hard to leave, but I know I gotta go now
Paris and London (On top of the world)
Baby, we're so down (Will you be my girl?)
Something I wanna say
Yeah, you know I'll be there

[Chorus]
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close, babe, close to my heart
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close, babe, close to my heart

[Bridge]
Holding you close to my heart, uh, yeah
So I'm laid back in the Maybach
Damn, these seats go way back
I was thinking about way back
When we used to say that
I was yours, you were mine
And we fought to pass the time
And I realized, I realized, that we

I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close, babe, close to my heart
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close, babe, close to my heart
You're new in the game, you need that magic juice, magic shoes in the game
Whipping that coupe, yeah
That passenger could've been you, yeah
I know that you're sick, you're tossing and turning, it feels like a futon, yeah
I got my own spread, spending old bread like a (like a) like a crouton, yeah
I'm cutting them checks, you cutting your finger while cutting them coupons, yeah
And this could've been you hun, I'm like maaaan this could've been you, hun
Booking all of these flights, with an account I created with you hun
I know that I'm too wrong
I got passcodes, on my two phones
My passport, it's been drew on
And I’m looking for someone to poop on, yeah

[Chorus]


Super ashamed
Or maybe it's you, and I've just been used to the blame, yeah
I'm writing these poems, using the pain
And my whole crew entertain, yeah
Killing these beats and abusing the stage
Then they in school everyday
You told me to do it this way, no excuses this way, when I do it this way, yeah
I look in my closet like "who stock i'm boostin' today?"
Who bitch am I making blue in the face?
Have I gotten cruel in a waaaaayyy? (Yeah)
But I whip that coupe anyway
And my jeweler like "girl what you doing today?"
I'm like "Rodney just got his computer today, more than likely we 'bout to go stupid today", yeah
Plus I'm cool anyway
I don't say what I do but I do what I say
And listen, when I said I wasn’t the same, I was talking bout who I’ve been banging

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Yeah, rumor has it that I'm armed
Somebody should have told them
When the cash starts flowing and the hands start reaching
Tsst, you read the contract your man ain't breaching
Uh, and rumor has it
The jeweler wants his money
But I'm out here rocking all my chains, real chunky, real comfy
And rumor has it when I hit the club hoes go dummy
And rumor has it, I'm doing magic
David Blaine, diamonds in the hat trick
Rumor has it, thought you had it
How is that true when I have it? Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Look at all these rumors, oh
Surrounding me every day, ah
I just need some time
Some time to get away, oh-ooh

My best friend said there’s a story out now
'Bout me and the girl next door
Look at all these rumors
Look at all these rumors

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, rumor has it, I'm a hazard
Don't give me no Hennessy, I might make some enemies
And rumor has it, I'm going broke, it's all smoke and mirrors
What happens when you smoke huh?
You start to see shit, start to believe shit
Can't read me, 'cause you believe what you read bitch
And rumor has it I need you for me to make it happen
You believe that shit, you really smoking crack then
Came up from a small room packed in
Used to drink out the tap, now I'm tapped in
And rumor has it I'ma die rich
Yeah, me and all my stacks in my casket, cramped in
Rumor has it there's a rumou 'bout me
They don't know what to do about me
And rumor has it there's a rumor 'bout you

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]

[Outro]
Would you rather know how it feel, to cop your mom a house on the hills
Fish tanks with the sharks and the eels, just enough cash, that all your pains heal
Would you ever ever ever know how it feels, to spend 10k on champagne and let it spill
Ever heard Bun B tell you you trill, is her ass real? I can tell you by how it feel
Would you ever ever ever know how it feel?
Probably not
Would you ever ever ever know how it feel?
Probably not
Probably not
I couldn't escape
I'd been escaping the whole time
I had to finally look
Look at the mess we had made
And all that's lacker the glory
And tarnished failures
Stare at it... and then leave

I was too comfortable
Being comfortable is what kills artists
There is creativity for validation and there is creativity for survival
They're very different places
I didn't know what I wanted to say
Didn't know how the ink would stick to the page
How to let go of the anxiety
And the suffocating fear that latched onto my vocal chords
I had to figure out how to use my voice again

So we went ghost
The Irish goodbye, into the woods in the dead of winter
We bought a 1985 Suburban, loaded up our equipment
And just left town
People make music for all different reasons
It's the fabric that connects us
We dance together, we cry together
We celebrate our communities
We question our politics
We laugh, we scream, we imagine, we live
What I couldn't find in a hotel room on the road, or even in Seattle
I found in the middle of nowhere, no reception
Making music not because we had to, but because we got to
I had forgotten how to do that
Not being afraid of the platform we were standing on
Not creating from a place of "Don't fuck it up"
But creating from a place of "Fuck it up"

Look at the mess
Not just the one that we created
But the one that is the very fabric of our country
The mess we're all living in
Stop being silent
Even if it's not perfect or politically correct, you have to speak up
You have to listen
Dance, cry, question everything
Laugh, scream, imagine, live

Music was never intended to be programmed to, manufactured and turned into a commodity
Music was intended to be that one thing that we could rely on to disrupt the norm
Start conversations and change the way that we think and we feel
If you aren't scared of what you created, you aren't done yet
On February 26th, I want to share with you
This Unruly Mess I've Made

And I’ll do it all again
This is who I am
Who I am
All I got
It’s all I need

[Verse 1]
Yeah, ugh
Started out wit zero
Just a fist full of tears
Just a pad and a pencil
As I scribbled down my fears
Screaming out I'm ready to die
That's a lie. I ain't going nowhere
Till all my niggas get a Benz
I'm sitting in the crib with the miraculous view
I FaceTime my little man, you know daddy miss you
But I gotta rock this tour and get this mortgage
Smile for us mama, damn you so supportive
So make sure I'm cleared, no distortion
I know we used to argue but you'll always be important
Don't cry for me
Looking out the window, flying over Miami
All bottles prolly poppin' but I'm turned in my album
Get amnesia when they ask
"Who you got your style from ?"
You niggas make me laugh till I cry
Scared to use your voice, all you have is your sight
A blogger’s gon’ blog, a baller’s gon' ball
Charge it to the game and get it in the lane and take the charge
72 and 10
I guess you can't win 'em all
Till my niggas hold on like you waiting on the car
And if you fall its my fault. Shit you know I got you

[Hook: (Tyga)]
I smile, I cry
(You know I got you)
In love I fall
(You know I got you)

This is who I am
(Ugh you know I got you)
(Yeah you know I got you)
Who I am
(You know I got you)
All I got is all I need
(I do it like I got to)

[Verse 2]
Ugh, pressure make diamonds
I put pressure all the times
So, I'm always at the jeweler getting fresher all the time
Time for a white suede happy to see me shine
Got me crying on your shoulder, Rawest Nigga Alive
Superb, stand up guy, tallest nigga alive
GQ Party Chateau Marmont
Saint Laurent suit, I had to show my mind
Pull up in the phantom, cameras know my car
Now you looking like me, bitch stole my look
Never played by the book
You see the shows I've booked
Money over bitches, see the hoes I shook
It was long cold nights on the road I took
All the shit I kicked, I should soak my foot
Don't cry for me, hear my flow you know I'm good
Ugh yeah you know I'm good
Cause a blogger's gon' blog, a baller's gon' ball
Check the names in the hall, see my name on the wall
You see everything I do
Matches everything I talk
I swear the summer's mine
And I never let you fall
And if you fall, it's my fault
You know I got you

[Hook: (Tyga)]
I smile, I cry
(You know I got you)
In love I fall

[Verse 1]
Cudi in the spot, all the lames ice-grillin'
Mad cause their girl call me Mr. Nice-feelin'
Must stay clear from the sneaks to the fade
I ain't even in the game and the nigga look paid
Cockroach niggas get sprayed with the Raid
No time for the drama, tryna get laid
Sippin', my mellow, Kid Mesc lady killer
Yo girl, I'm a fill her like gas to the tank
Nice skin, college girl, wanna come to Scotty's world
Like to wear it straight, wanna cut her hair like 

[?]
I wanna pop, but you're a bad bitch
Says she a magician, wanna show me tricks
Told her I'm a beast in the sheets and the booth
Says she ain't believe me, need to see some proof
Pulled out my demo, then pulled out a condom
Told her let's go, while we listen to my album

[Chorus]
I'm that boy
I'm that
Niggas need to know
I spit high, high
I'm that boy

Niggas need to know

Niggas see the potential, wreck shit King Kong
Beat bot tiller, he a beat Godzilla
I'm that nigga, boy boy, told you before
Screwed up shit in the deck and move slow
Got a neck from a chick and neck move slow
Perform on stage, hoes in the front row
They try to take that like i was Sean Combs
Bitch get down
You need to go home or you get dick down
I use slump, let the base line thump
And it bumps and it thumps that all the cops get mad
I chill cause I'm ill, up in the game all smacks
The races for cake, doing a hundred meters dash
Sit back and I laugh, cause these others are jokes
They might just get slapped and those will get choked

[Chorus]
I'm that boy
I'm that
Niggas need to know
I spit high, high
I'm that boy
I'm that
Niggas need to know

[Intro]
These niggas don't want it with us, they're pussy
Philly!

[Verse 1]
Posted in the trenches, all my chains on
Probably riding 'lone with your main jawn
Louboutin kicks ain't got a stain on 'em
Finger by the head, I call it brainstorming
She gon' suck me off while I reel the Wraith
You be in your hood never feeling safe
Stacking up the money, trying to fill the safe
I'm never coming home, I catch another case
Felonies, my niggas got felonies
We are selling dog food, I'm talking that pedigree
Had that white girl popping when niggas was selling trees
And when we were selling trees, those busting like bumblebees
Oh, never love the hoes, I've been in and out 'em
If you need the work, know my nigga got it
Trapped the twenty-eights for the thirty-six
It's cooking right in front of you like Benihana

[Hook]
Blowing money fast, blowing money fast
Blowing money fast, blowing money fast
Running through the bag, running through the bag
Blowing money fast, blowing money fast
When you came from nothing, fuck being humble
Fuck being humble, fuck being humble
Tell 'em that I'm strapped, I don't wanna rumble
Fuck being humble, fuck being humble

[Verse 2]
Fuck being humble when you in the 'Rari
If I hit your ho, I ain't even sorry
I threw and I caught it like I'm Dez Bryant
Chain Roc Nation, all these damn diamonds
I feel like I'm Michee before he went to jail
Fucking up Atlanta every time I hit it
Mixing that Givenchy with the YSL
Last time I checked, I was that fucking nigga
Feel evident and we chasing money and never women
Balling on bitches like Curry and we don't ever miss 'em
Bust 'em down, fuck 'em good, never kiss 'em
Tell your baby daddy I said, "Fuck his feelings!"

[Hook]
Blowing money fast, blowing money fast
Blowing money fast, blowing money fast
Running through the bag, running through the bag
Blowing money fast, blowing money fast
When you came from nothing, fuck being humble
Fuck being humble, fuck being humble
Tell 'em that I'm strapped, I don't wanna rumble
Fuck being humble, fuck being humble

[Outro]
When you came from nothing, fuck being humble
Fuck being humble, fuck being humble
Tell 'em that I'm strapped, I don't wanna rumble
Fuck being humble, fuck being humble

[Verse]
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman
Ain't nobody tell 'em, this ain't what they want man
You ain't really write it, I'm like "who's your stuntman?"
Back to back, the Maybach, I be really stuntin'
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
Steppin' out in blood, walkin' through the mud
We got all the guns and got all the drugs
I went and spent $250 on my cousin's case
To beat his body, shit I coulda bought a fuckin' Wraith
But now he home, I make him put you on the fuckin' plate
So many hundreds, got them bitches fallin' out the safe, ho!
Money make them bitches swallow everything
Bought my chick a rock, that shit look like a wedding ring
Out in Philly, I'm like Pablo in the Medellin
Hundred bricks, we got 'em bouncin' like a trampoline
36s, 28, we sellin' pizza, nigga
If you ain't starve with the Chasers, you ain't eatin' with us
Shit, they was tryna ride the wave, jetskiing niggas
But I'm so stuck up in my ways, I don't be with niggas
I don't know them guys, y'all believe them niggas?
Headbands and double parts, do y'all see them niggas?
We the type to run up on 'em, try to leave them niggas
We really started from the bottom, unlike, we them niggas
You took her to an island, I fucked her on a couch
I fucked her in the studio, she never seen my house
She told me that you're lame, I told her clean you out
I got that pussy same day she made you eat her out, woo!
Was that my girl's tour or the world tour?
I do not know what you pussy niggas goin' for
This that hundred K a night when you perform tour
Swimmin' in that good pussy while you're on tour, oh!

[Intro]
DC, unos, dos, tres, cuatro
Free El Chapo!

[Verse 1]
Fuck your bitch, get a bag from her, then I never call her
Now she trippin', goin' crazy, nigga tell her let up off us
OGs see me comin' through and they say, "That's a baller"
That's that nigga really started from the bottom really in that order
Make a call, bring them plans down
Smokin' loud like surround sound
Niggas wanna come around now
Cause they know that Meek Milly got the crown now
Put my mask on, put the crown down
Tell 'em turn up
When it come to action, niggas ride with me
Screamin' murder
Niggas fallin' off, bitches fallin' through
Callin' plays like an audible
Get that money, what you oughta do
Need the plug, got them niggas callin' too
Put you on, nigga, put you on, I can put you on
What you doin', nigga, what you doin', nigga, what you doin'?
Get the bag but I'm way triller
You around cause you paid niggas
In the dark when we spray niggas
When we run into you, we ain't playin' with you
Meek put a rapper on CNN
Niggas said I wouldn't eat again
I just counted 5 mil' in cash
I'm a real nigga they won't see again

[Hook]
Pray to my God we don't go to the feds
We don't go to the feds
I pray all that money don't go to my head
Don't go to my head
I pray on my Glock when I'm goin' to bed
When I'm goin' to bed
Now pray for the suckas that wanted me dead
Cause all of 'em dead! Fuck 'em

[Verse 2]
People locked me, put them chains on me
Wonder why I got these chains on me
Audemars, I got a range on me
Shit a hundred thousand ain't a thing to me
What's your range, homie? This another level
Flood the Rollie, get another bezel
She don't dig me, get another shovel
Go and get the money, we don't ever settle
Went to jail, came back home, then I got rich, damn
Went to jail again, then I came home then I got Nick, damn
Niggas prayin' that I go to jail again so they can pop shit, damn
Only trap nigga doin' real numbers spittin' hot shit
Niggas hatin' cause my numbers down, what'd you do, 50?
20 somethin', I did 250
MAC 11 hit you 20 times, now you Harlem Shaking like you Diddy
Pop niggas spittin' melodies when it's really nothin' they can do with me
Ballin' on 'em ain't new to me, fuckin' bitches ain't new to me
Summers, summers
10 summers I've been at my tempo like I'm Mustard
At the Grammys with the hustlers
Went to trap 'cause you a busta
Spillin' lean on the red carpet
Phone tapped, I hear the feds talkin'
Still trappin' out the bando
Moonwalkin' on that damn marble
Ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin'
Ballin' on 'em like I'm James Harden
I don't drive it if it ain't foreign
I don't fuck it if it ain't foreign
Still eatin' and I ain't tourin', nigga gettin' it
Got that ladder with me with the 33, I'm Scottie Pippen it

[Hook]
Pray to my God we don't go to the feds
We don't go to the feds
I pray all that money don't go to my head
Don't go to my head
I pray on my Glock when I'm goin' to bed
When I'm goin' to bed
Now pray for the suckas that wanted me dead
Cause all of 'em dead! Fuck 'em

[Outro]
Ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin'
Ballin' on 'em like I'm James Harden
I don't drive it if it ain't foreign
I don't fuck it if it ain't foreign
Still eatin' and I ain't tourin', nigga gettin' it
Got that ladder with me with the 33, I'm Scottie Pippen it

[Intro]
Let them niggas have the Grammys, we got the streets
We rich already and my chick the baddest
This Rollie like my trophy, young nigga

[Hook]
When they needed motivation (What you do?)
I gave 'em hope
When my nigga needed money (What you do?)
I gave him dope
Every time we went to war (What we do?)
We gave 'em smoke
Fiends was copping, I was broke
Fuck that shit, we gave 'em soap
They forgot we gave 'em hope

[Verse 1]
I would spend time on that corner trying to stack me a hundred up
Strapped with that Glock with on my hip shit the coppers was running up
I look at these niggas and I can tell they are not one of us
I ride in the back like a nigga that can't ride the front of the bus
They had it segregated, bulletproof Caddy, I escalated
Stepped up in my game like a escalator
When you shine like I shine, you get extra haters
Seen 'em ride with the fake and I hesitated
"Wait, these niggas serious?", or maybe Meek Milly delirious
Judge had to sentence a nigga, no period
I'm putting fear in these niggas, ain't sparing these niggas
I cut out your head with a hair on the trigger
Try to reach for my chain shit I deal with you niggas
I end one of you niggas, had the paramedics screaming, "Clear", on you niggas
Uh, back in the Phil, we gon' get to the money and stack up that dough 'til it way up
'Member them bitches? They played us back in the day like a Sega
Now I got paper, young nigga doing so major
Niggas is hater, look as they faces
Yeah, we still balling, bitch, it's the Chasers

[Hook]
I gave 'em hope
When my nigga needed money (What you do?)
I gave him dope
Every time we went to war (What we do?)
We gave 'em smoke
Fiends was copping, I was broke
Fuck that shit, we gave 'em soap
They forgot we gave 'em hope

[Verse 2]
Uh, look at the money and stack it up
I talk about it, I bag it up
You popping shit on your Instagram
Shit that you're popping ain't adding up
Shit that you're popping ain't making sense
I got fifty reasons say you're taking dick
And it's fifty reasons I should kill, nigga
But, for real, nigga, I been taking trips with my Philly niggas
Got the richest chick, she's from your hood
Niggas hating on me, I ain't really tripping, shit, I'm good
I be in the 40 with the .40 on me like I should
I be deep in your hood where you never be at
Be with them guys that you never could dap
You could never adapt
You know the game, if you cosign a rat, you forever a rat
We were never with that
You tried to go "Money" May with that paper, but now you in debt cause you never was that
Fuck is you high? You know better than that
Mention my name and Berettas with that
I move for real in these streets, in the world with that piece I'm like Metta with that
Fuck what you heard, I'm a get mine out the curb
I'm a just sit back I watch and observe
How niggas, they didn't ride the wave and they surf
I'm on my surfboard, this what I worked for
Mention my name, the shit your get murked for
Shit you get robbed for, shit you get killed for
Shit you get carried boxes into church for, oh

[Hook]
I gave 'em hope
When my nigga needed money (What you do?)
I gave him dope
Every time we went to war (What we do?)
We gave 'em smoke
Fiends was copping, I was broke
Fuck that shit, we gave 'em soap
They forgot we gave 'em hope

[Intro]
Is it recording? Alright, hahah

[Chorus]
I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
My whip dripping, too much candy in my paint
Bitches they love RD
They watch me, they love me, they need me like nicotine
Fresher than most, straight off the boat
Counting my dough
Just a red head boy from the city, Versace robe
On me like I'm Diddy
One hand on her titty
Other gripping money
Lifes so sweet right now
Better lock down your hoe
Before I come through your town
Living so profound
Watch them hate me now
Bitches used to talk down
Now they ride like Greyhound
They ride like greyhounds cause I did 'em in and out

[Chorus]
I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I be loaded, too many pistols on my waist
Let a fuck nigga try me, find me a skrrt
I'ma go, I'ma go straight to his house
Gold on my mouth
Coming straight from the south
Me, I look pop right now
Water dripping, someone give me a towel
Man I took off, someone gave me a roll
Good lean when I fuck on yo hoe
Shout out to Roll, that's my big bro
Who is these niggas? Man, nobody knows
Nigga get mad, I put dick in his hoe
Wrap it up, body bagging his hoe, hoe, woah

[Chorus]
I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face

[Outro]
And it's too much water
Dripping, man it's too much water
Splash, too much water
We too fly, dripping too much water
Too much sauce, we dripping too much water
Lil Yachty drip too much water
Your hoe tryna drink my water

I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Tongue kisses, stank hoes at the Coachella
Thank the Lord she never listen what a hoe tell her
Not only could I do better, but I know better
How could I ever be the king without a Coretta?
Feelin' like Rae, same damn 'Lo sweater
MAC 10, Beretta for the cold weather
Her ex let her blow cheddar, she a go getter
Hoe, clothes fit her, Moetter, but her flow better
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Keep machine gun strapped in case a nigga wanna act up
Petite gun raps ain't even strong enough to match us
Machine gun BLAT in case a nigga wanna act tough
Ain't nothin' like a bad bitch
That make a jiggy nigga wanna go and run up in that shit raw
Like Bruh Man from the 5th floor
I creep up in it, deep up in it 'til she tell a nigga, "It's yours"
I know this shit is mine for the takin'
If I ain't in Mason it's some gay shit
Prolly why I don't react when you say shit
Half the times niggas don't even make sense
Know this shit is yours
When you do a world tour all off a mixtape shit
You know this shit is yours
When your face on every magazine cover, every page shit
You know this shit is yours
When you fuck a new different bad broad every day shit
Only get high just to compliment my maintenance
I took a little moment out to say this

[Hook: Drake]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours

It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

[Bridge: Drake]
How you feel about comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

[Hook: Drake]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that

Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

No bail
And guilty as hell (Well)
See if talking shit is really a crime
Then arrest me, stop, Dre's fucked this time

Screenshots, ass shots, and Ciroc shots
That’s why I don’t trust them bitches
She ain’t friendly with them other bitches
All they is to her is competition
She just want be complemented
She just want a hundred million followers
Back it up, bend it over on this obelisk
On your back, knees up, gynecologist
And you know who stays anonymous
Put it together then it’s obvious but

[Hook]
You so focused on who fucking who you don’t realize who fucking you
You so suckered into who fucking who you don’t realize who fucking you motherfucker
Bend over, bend over
Grab your ankles, touch your knees, bend over
Motherfucker, bend over, bend over
Grab your ankles, touch your knees, bend over motherfucker
You be buggin' over who fucking who you don’t realize who fucking you
You be buggin' over who fucking who you don’t realize who fucking you motherfucker
Bend over

[Verse 2]
Bob, miss me with them conscious lyrics
You sound just like the one percenters
You must of did a bunch of acid
Either that or you just fucking with us
You want to be a star, sell out concert tickets?
A mansion and a Hollywood subdivision?
You get the fame under one condition
You get copied at the cloning center
They kill ‘em with a common ending
Overdose from a drug addiction
Same story, same headline
A stroke, a heart attack, an aneurysm
Celebrities and politicians
Just to name a couple members
Rituals and pedophilia
Sacrifices, blood religion
The queen of England got arrest warrants
For the disappearance of a dozen children
Do your research on the topic
The same time every year kids come up missing

[Hook]
But you so focused on who fucking who you don’t realize who fucking you
You so suckered into who fucking who you don’t realize who fucking you motherfucker
Bend over, bend over
Grab your ankles, touch your knees, bend over
Motherfucker, bend over, bend over
Grab your ankles, touch your knees, bend over motherfucker
You be bugging off of who fucking who you don’t realize who fucking you
You be bugging off of who fucking who you don’t realize who fucking you motherfucker
Bend, bend, bend, bend, bend
Get, get, get bent motherfucker

[Intro]
It's painful you know, the situation I am now tellin' my story is not easy to talk about it
But I found a way which I can talk about it through the music

[Verse 1]
Feel me gun, feel me knife
And me bullets to take the life from me
Feel me drugs to try and fight
All my memories of the night and day
I often ask myself to run away
I'm still ashamed that I ain't done it yet
I'm still feel bad from when they come my way
Good livin' in the summer day

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a war child, yeah
There ain't no love for no war child, yeah
Watch your back, lay 'em down
Pull the trigger, bang
Pull me on the floor, bang me on the kitchen sink
Why you can't fight? Tell me why they have to go
Take me to your village and prepare me for the war

[Verse 2]
Livin' sin, livin' walls
This is my fear now
Mama dead, father cried
Try to find a way to people that like me inside
This the war, ain't no stoppin' now
Bodies on the floor, children on them bodies
When you hear the roar, who is causin' that?
Oh that just be me you must of got me in the eye

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a war child, yeah
There ain't no love for no war child, yeah
Watch your back, lay 'em down
Pull the trigger, bang
Pull me on the floor, bang me on the kitchen sink
Why you can't fight? Tell me why they have to go
Take me to your village and prepare me for the war

[Outro]
Interviewer: When you were a kid goin' through this stuff, you were goin' through it even as a child, did you lose hope and faith?
Tory: A point where I lose, I want to shoot myself. You know, a couple of times I cock my gun and I put it on my head and
Interviewer: "And how old were you?"
Tory:  I was uh, the time I did that I think I was 11 and a half. And sometime, I don't know what stopped me. Somethin' told me to die, Nigel, don't die because you are shootin' yourself. And that's the situation, one of the situation you know about part of the story I told you I was almost hittin' my friend. There was so many things goin' on in my head. A place, I'm walkin' in the desert, when we had no water and so I was so thirsty and I wanted to finish myself
A man who fought for freedom
A man who fought for equality
Those who were against him
Were too blind to see
What this man was fighting for
So Blacks, Hispanics, Jews and Asians could put their foot in the door
Yes, we know that this man is great
That's why today we celebrate
Everyone lifts their voice and sing
For a man who wanted freedom to ring
Martin Luther King is who I'm speaking of
A man whose name means love

Every breath is a prayer of some kind

And you're so well, blue wonderful
Blue wonderful to me

[Verse 2]
Like swimming in your eyes
I dive in, I dive deep, I just swim
I lose myself in you, blue wonderful
Blue wonderful again

Don't you know where you go? I will follow
In your footsteps I find my own feet
Addicted like I am to the blues
Kind of blue of all the blues I need

[Verse 3]
Yesterday did someone else's song
In sixty-five summertime, don't let go
Long before you came, blue wonderful
The blue wonderful I know

[Verse 4]
Ain't just something I just left behind
In the past, far away, used to be
But your presence, my blue wonderful
Blue wonderful to me

[Chorus 2]
Go where you want, when you want to
Just don't let the wind tear you free
Stick around the light that brings you home
Don't ever hang around with the breeze

Don't you know where you go? I will follow
In your footsteps I find my own feet

You know that it's comin', you know that it's karma
Death before dishonor, I am Your Honor
Nancy Reagan raised a monster
They say that Ronny armed the contras
All that shit without a conscience
So why would I's have a conscience?
A generation livin' Godless, could never make it out the darkness

[Outro: Guordan Banks]
They say two wrongs don't make a right
But if it's my blood, someone has to die, yeah
Cause in the street life, you gotta sacrifice, oh yeah
Either my life or your life, oh
They say two wrongs don't make a right

[Hook]
It's much too groovy a summer's day
It's much too groovy a summer's day
It's much too groovy a summer's day
It's much too groovy a summer's day

[Verse 1]
If money is your God who's your Devil?
If everybody die what make you special?
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto
And I wonder if it's crowded
Okay now I'm acting childish but hey
Don't force your religion on me
And I won't force my non-religion on you
Truth's the only thing I'm devoted to
So am I equal or just goyem to you
So Bob your fourth album how does it feel?
Ever wonder why every artist want out of they deal?
The price you pay to sell out record stores
When they say they sell they soul it's not a metaphor
Bandź

[Hook]
It's much too groovy a summer's day
It's much too groovy a summer's day
It's much too groovy a summer's day
It's much too groovy a summer's day

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I wonder if JFK tried to warn us a storm was around the corner
Most of these law enforcers just force us all in a corner
Then make it hard for the farmers
Ya son ya wife and ya daughter
They make it hard to support 'em
I'm just here to inform ya
The power structure's enormous
Speaking out on these topics like swattin' a nest of hornets
They come from the left and right
They swarm our bodies like garments
With chemicals here to harm us
After you bust ya ass they tax yo ass for a portion
That's parasitic behavior
How dare they minimum wage us?
How dare you mention a pay cut
Like we didn't read the terms and conditions
And they betrayed us
Don't need permission to wake up
'Cause silence is your consent for them to consistently rape us
Let's go

[Hook]
It's much too groovy a summer's day
(Let's go)
It's much too groovy a summer's day
(Let's- Let's go)
It's much too groovy a summer's day
(Let's- Let's go)
It's much too groovy a summer's day
(Let's go)

[Verse 3]
My mentality is post apocalyptic
I think in hieroglyphic
We live inside a system that's mostly monolithic
America the company who owns the title?
Shit I don't know it could be Russia or China
That's why they identify you as property
Born into robbery
No Robin Hood
If Satan had a house it'd be in Hollywood
Walkin' away is the most difficult part
Red carpet 'fore for the rituals start
They know they can't keep me in check
Or keep me asleep with a check
As long as it's breath in my chest
I'm pressing these niggas to death
I'll never regret
The past that I led
Or the path that I took
I learned what I needed with every step
Bandz

[Hook]
It's much too groovy a summer's day
(Let's go)
It's much too groovy a summer's day
(Let's- Let's go)
It's much too groovy a summer's day
(Let's- Let's go)
It's much too groovy a summer's day
(Let's go)

Number one question they're askin'
Fuck every question you askin' (Straight up, yeah)

Yea-ah

[Chorus: Kanye West & Travis Scott]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'

The world, the world, the world
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
The world, the world, the world
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Miley Cyrus]
(Ohh-oh-oh-oh)
Stop all that coon shit
Early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb, bitch (Yea-ah)
Black out the room, bitch
Stop all that coon shit
These niggas ain't doin' shit
Them niggas ain't doin' shit
Come on homie what happened
You niggas ain't breathin', you gaspin'
These niggas ain't ready for action-action
Ready-ready for action

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Refrain: Kanye West & Travis Scott]
So follow me up 'cause this shit 'bout to go (Down)
I'm doin' 500, I'm outta control (Now)
But there's nowhere to go (Now)
And there's no way to slow (Down)
If I knew what I knew in the past (The world, the wor-)
I would've been blacked out on your ass

Everybody wanna rule it
Get inside it, why they do it
Everybody, ride a little bit
Everybody, body do it
Do it, do it

[Verse 1]
In the morning when I tell you that I'm through
In the evening baby there's a call for you
In the morning when I'm crawling out of bed
In the evening baby I'm crawling in my head

[Chorus]
It could be anyone
It could be anyone, but baby baby it's you
It could be anyone
It could be anyone, but baby baby it's you

[Verse 2]
In the morning that's the lipstick on my head
In the evening when I'm coming up the stairs
In the morning when I'm trying to find my clothes
In the evening well I'm knocking on your door

[Chorus]
It could be anyone
It could be anyone but baby baby it's you
It could be anyone
It could be anyone but baby baby it's you
(And your big fat momma, too!)

[Verse 3]
In the morning when I tell you that it's over
In the evening got a black mark on my shoulder
In the morning say a prayer for absolution
In the evening tell myself there's no confusion

[Chorus]
It could be anyone
It could be anyone, but baby baby it's you
It could be anyone
It could be anyone, but baby baby it's you

I don't wanna go to school

Leaving all my problems at the door
Pouring up, soon as you think it’s enough they bringin’ more
Hanging onto what niggas told me “get your paper up”
You work hard for what you got, they could never take it from you
All you need is a little patience, let me demonstrate
All my niggas in the game, we talkin’ ‘cause we been through it
Rolling weed in raw papers, taking shots, gin got me faded
If I get back to your spot, won’t know how I made it

[Verse 1]
Pulled into the parking lot, parked it
Zipped up my parka, joined the procession of marchers
In my head like, "Is this awkward?
Should I even be here marching?"
Thinking if they can't, how can I breathe?
Thinking that they chant, what do I sing?
I want to take a stance 'cause we are not free
And then I thought about it, we are not "we"
Am I in the outside looking in, or am I in the inside looking out?
Is it my place to give my two cents?
Or should I stand on the side and shut my mouth?
"No justice, no peace," okay, I'm saying that
They're chanting out, "Black Lives Matter," but I don't say it back
Is it okay for me to say? I don't know, so I watch and stand
In front of a line of police that look the same as me
Only separated by a badge, a baton, a can of Mace, a mask
A shield, a gun with gloves and hands that gives an alibi
In case somebody dies behind a bullet that flies out of the 9
Takes another child's life on sight, bam!
*Gunshot*

[Hook]
Blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free
There's blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free
Blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free
There's blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free
Blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free
There's blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free

[Interlude 1]

[Macklemore, speaking over voices]
"Oh, what are you doing Ben? What are you doing here?"

[Various indistinct male voices]
"Probably shouldn't be here, you have white supremacy, don't fuckin' come here. — Culture Vulture! — ('Black Lives Matter,' say it.) — Wow. — ('Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter.') — You should not have done that. Why the fuck would you do that? — (What are you doing here?) — You always react. Just let it go, man. — White racist. — It's the Grammys!"

[Macklemore]
"Ben, think about it."

[Verse 2]
You've exploited and stolen the music, the moment
The magic, the passion, the fashion, you toy with
The culture was never yours to make better
You're Miley, you're Elvis, you're Iggy Azalea
Fake and so plastic, you've heisted the magic
You've taken the drums and the accent you rapped in
Your brand of hip-hop, it's so fascist and backwards
That Grandmaster Flash'd go slap it, you bastard
All the money that you made
Of the watered-down, pop-bullshit version of the culture, pal
Go buy a big-ass lawn, go with your big-ass house
Get a big-ass fence, keep people out
It's all stolen, anyway, can't you see that now?
There's no way for you to even that out
You can join the march, protest, scream and shout
Get on Twitter, hashtag, and seem like you're down
But they see through it all, people believe you now?
You said publicly, "Rest in peace, Mike Brown"
You speak about equality, but do you really mean it?
Are you marching for freedom, or when it's convenient?
Want people to like you, want to be accepted
That's probably why you are out here protesting
Don't think for a second you don't have incentive
Is this about you, well, then what's your intention?
What's the intention? What's the intention?

[Interlude 2: Protesters]
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"

[Verse 3]
"Pssst, I totally get it, you're by yourself
And the last thing you wanna do is take a picture
But seriously, my little girl loves you
She's always singing, 'I'm gonna pop some tags'
I'm not kidding, my oldest, you even got him to go thrifting
And 'One Love,' oh my God, that song, brilliant
Their aunt is gay, when that song came out
My son told his whole class he was actually proud
That's so cool, look what you're accomplishing
Even an old mom like me likes it, 'cause it's positive
You're the only hip-hop that I let my kids listen to
'Cause you get it, all that negative stuff it isn't cool"
Yeah?
"Yeah, like, all the guns and the drugs
The bitches and the hoes and the gangs and the thugs
Even the protest outside, so sad, and so dumb
If a cop pulls you over, it's your fault if you run"
Huh?

[Interlude 3: Various male and female voices]
"So, they feel that the police are discriminating against the... the black people? — I have an advantage? Why? 'Cause I'm white? (laughs) What? (laughs) No. — See, more people nowadays are just pussies. Like, this is the generation to be offended by everything. — 'Black Lives Matter' thing is a reason to take arms up over perceived slights. — I'm not prejudiced, I just... — 99% of the time, across this country, the police are doing their job properly."

[Verse 4]
Damn, a lot of opinions, a lot of confusion, a lot of resentment
Some of us scared, some of us defensive
And most of us aren't even paying attention
It seems like we're more concerned with being called racist
Than we actually are with racism
I've heard that silences are action and God knows that I've been passive
What if I actually read a article, actually had a dialogue
Actually looked at myself, actually got involved?
If I'm aware of my privilege and do nothing at all, I don't know
Hip-hop has always been political, yes
It's the reason why this music connects
So what the fuck has happened to my voice if I stay silent when black people are dying
And I'm trying to be politically correct?
I can book a whole tour, sell out the tickets
Rap entrepreneur, built his own business
If I'm only in this for my own self-interest
Not the culture that gave me a voice to begin with
And this isn't authentic, it is just a gimmick
The DIY underdog, so independent
But the one thing the American dream fails to mention
Is I was many steps ahead to begin with
My skin matches the hero, likeness, the image
America feels safe with my music in their systems
And it suited me perfect, the role, I fulfilled it
And if I'm the hero, you know who gets cast as the villain
White supremacy isn't just a white dude in Idaho
White supremacy protects the privilege I hold
White supremacy is the soil, the foundation, the cement and the flag that flies outside of my home
White supremacy is our country's lineage, designed for us to be indifferent
My success is the product of the same system that let off Darren Wilson – guilty
We wanna dress like, walk like, talk like, dance like, yet we just stand by
We take all we want from black culture, but will we show up for black lives?
We wanna dress like, walk like, talk like, dance like, yet we just stand by
We take all we want from black culture, but will we show up for black lives?

[Interlude 4: Various male and female voices]
"Black Lives Matter, to use an analogy, is like if... if there was a subdivision and a house was on fire. The fire department wouldn't show up and start putting water on all the houses because all houses matter. They would show up and they would turn their water on the house that was burning because that's the house that needs the help the most. — My generation's taken on the torch of a very age-old fight for black liberation, but also liberation for everyone. Injustice anywhere is still injustice everywhere. — The best thing white people can do is talk to each other, having those very difficult, very painful conversations with your parents, with your family members. — I think one of the critical questions for white people in this society is, 'What are you willing to risk? What are you willing to sacrifice to create a more just society?'"

[Outro: Jamila Woods]
Your silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury
Your silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury
Your silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury
Your silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury
What I got for me, it is for me
What we made, we made to set us free
What I got for me, it is for me
What we made, we made to set us free
What I got for me, it is for me
What we made, we made to set us free

She swerved and I'm gon' flip the switch

I copped a crib with a court
Stop flexing you ain't in no force

[Interlude]
Little bitch, know what I'm saying?

'Cause little bitches starting to bore me

[Verse 3]
These little bitches starting to bore me
All these little hoes getting boring
That's why Yachty started touring
That's why I be driving foreigns
Hey, hey, alright
These little bitches they got me high
Why you come if you not sucking cock?
Why these niggas be thinkin' they bloods?
All my bloods turn they block to a flood
He was tough 'til he saw what it was
All my gang on that gunplay and stuff (What up?)
All my niggas look rugged as fuck
All my life I been jugging for bucks
Fuck a job, I can't work for no nigga
So I block post to stack up the figures
Columbine shawty, that's me
I put the hole in his teeth
I put the hole in his teeth
I ran a block with the heat
Put a few caps in his feet
Make him jump rope to the beat
I fuck his bitch with no hezzo
Yachty, I might run for prezzo

[Verse 1]
Why is it so hard to accept the party is over?
You came with your new friends
And her mom jeans and her new Vans
And she's perfect and I hate it
Oh so glad you made it
I'm so glad you could come by
Somebody get the tacos, somebody spark the blunt
Let's start the Narcos off at episode one
Bring the gin, got the juice
Bring the sin, got that too
Won't you just shut up, know you're my favorite
Am I...

[Chorus]
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya
Is it warm enough for ya inside me, me, me, me?
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya
Warm enough outside, inside me, me, me, me

[Verse 2]
I get so lonely, I forget what I'm worth
We get so lonely, we pretend that this works
I'm so ashamed of myself think I need therapy-y-y-y
I'm sorry I'm not more attractive
I'm sorry I'm not more ladylike
I'm sorry I don't shave my legs at night
I'm sorry I'm not your baby mama
I'm sorry you got karma comin' to you
Collect your soul, get it right

[Chorus]
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya
Is it warm enough for ya inside me, me, me, me?
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya
Warm enough outside, inside me, me, me, me

[Bridge]
Sorry, I just need to see you
I'm sorry I'm so clingy I don't mean to be a lot
Do you really wanna love me down like you say you do?
Give it to me like you say you do?
'Cause it's hard enough you got to treat me like this
Lonely enough to let you treat me like this
Do you really love me?
Or just wanna love me down, down, down, down?

[Chorus]
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya
Is it warm enough for ya inside me, me, me, me?
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya
Warm enough outside, inside me, me, me, me

[Outro]
Warm enough outside, inside
Warm enough outside, inside me-me-me-me, me-me-me
Ohh-whoa, is it warm enough outside, inside?

Rollin' through the highways of my mind
Run, run, run
Swerving, speeding faster, I can feel it
Catching trouble faster than I see it
One day I'll settle down
Simmer, simmer, simmer shawty
Run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run
I'll never wait around
For you to go and get it for me
I promise I won't
If you say you love me now

[Lyrics from Snippet]

Trust in self
Forgotten my
Interest in you
Got to move fast
Fast

...

You must really like feelin' stupid
You do that a lot, All the time keep abusin' me

...


You can’t get ready and you can’t get right
And you so concerned with what you might see in the mirror
Not ready, you still baking
Your man on time and just learned how to use a beauty blender
Fuck sephora, I love sephora
Just cannot afford the things up in there
I used to work there
The only job I never got fired from (What)
Sorry I get tattoo at thirteen
Sorry I lose virgin at thirteen
Sorry I no trust men, they hurt me
Time and time and time and time again

[Lyrics from Snippet]

Let me cover yo shit in glitter
I could make it gold
Make you wanna sell your soul
Gotcha  bleedin' out your nose

...

Lately I've been questionin'
Am I all that I pretend to be?
I doubt it

(incomplete)

[Verse: SZA]
I think I'm bad as hell
I got issues, out of line
Sayin' tomorrow I'll get the dishes
Never come
Easy bake, easy wake, oven
Just give as much as you take
Forgive as much as you hate
Or get the fuck out

[Pre-Chorus: SZA]
I've been in the dugout (Dugout)
Lookin' for a way out (Way out)
You know just takin' it slow (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now I'm feeling worn out (Worn out)
Lookin' for a way out (Way out)
Somebody show me the door (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy & SZA]
I was wavy
I've been waitin' for you, boy
And I was drownin'
Ooh
I went crazy
I've been goin' crazy, boy
And I found out, this the way out (Ooh)
Now I'm wavy
Now I'm wavy

[Outro: SZA]
You know just takin' it slow babe
Somebody show me the door babe
You know just takin' it slow babe
Somebody show me the ropes, babe
... Favourite
I did it every day yeah
Oh yeah
I did it every day
Just to be the kind of girl you like
I wish I was comfortable in my
Skin...

[Lyrics from Snippet]

Nigga who you

Never knew a thing about me
Screw you
Always talking about another nigga
Who you?
Never knew a thing a about me
Screw you
I never knew I never knew

[Verse 1:]
Of the world spun by evil men with lies
Only programmed to agree with what we see before our eyes
Running after status quo on a television show
Just a picture-perfect life is the only life we know
And this uncomfortable reality got me chasing, chasing fallacy
And the pace, the pace is killing me, but I so willingly practiced sin
Just like it's my friend when the whole world is a hustle

Exactly where did we arrive in this manufactured life?
To sell my soul just to survive (yes) in the game of numbers I
I must thank the Gods of Industry, oh, for the opportunity
Or I display such loyalty, oh, for the way that they exploit me (yes)

- Oh, to consider life outside of this
Just like a splinter in my mind persists
But the Ministry of Fear exists
Only to keep me from knowing the truth
Stealing my youth when the whole world is a hustle -

Escape familiarity means that I must face the fear in me
Do something with this greed in me in order to address this need in me
Oh but I must confess the pride I keep, protect it as if it's my friend
Oh, when will it end? When the whole world is a hustle
To escape this mere analogy means that I must face the fear in me
Do something with this greed in me in order to address this need in me
Oh but I must confess the pride I keep, protect it as if it's my friend
Until the bitter end when the whole of the world is a hustle

Everybody’s got it going on (yeah right, yeah right)
Everybody’s so damn strong (yeah right, yeah right)
When the whole of the world is a hustle, a hustle (x5)
I must exercise my faith cuz faith is a muscle
When the whole world is a hustle

[Hook]
Let's be honest
I wake up in the morning get shit jumping
She gon' get that D with my thumb in
No Benihana just top ramen
I feel like King Tutankhamun

[Verse 1]
Uh, pay your homage
Bobby Ray the shaman
Namaste, or something conscious, I promise
Saw this day was coming
Like a plague or something
Hundred nations form a summit
Congress, no hesitation coming
Try to take it from me
Terminator style I'm dumping
Dumping, clip gon' kick back like Liu Kang
Or fucking Johnny Cage
Them hollows graze your stomach
Vomit, everyday or something
Some grenade or something
Someone say that someones bombing the gunman
Propagate and conflicts sway the moral compass
You debate on who done done it
Converse, I'ma stay a slum
It's still segregated proms in the state I'm from
And they still gon' bang you up for an ashtray of crumbs
If a cop could pop you, no indictment
It's obvious the justice system pretty biased
Take your right away like arthritis
The eye of the all seeing iris

[Hook]
Let's be honest
I wake up in the morning get shit jumping
She gon' get that D with my thumb in
No Benihana just top ramen
I feel like King Tutankhamun

[Verse 2]
Like I’m suffering from ego death
Need no stress, lean on deck, weed on deck
Green thumb, I’m Imhotep
They depopulate you with chemo
They'll steal your breath, beast mode
There ain't no more heroes left
Hercules complex all black incognito
Like Ne-Yo at Emo Fest, flip like aikido
Arm the torpedo, I'm armed and I'm reloaded
Three piece tuxedo, I bomb like a G though
Bondage just like a slave or something
That can't awaken from it
We ain't got a thing in common, you common
Minus the sense, keep your eyes on your rent
And them commas modern economics consumption
Summon critics in my comments
A conference of conversations and assumptions, it's constant
Pill's too big to ever stomach, you astonished
I never claimed I'm Nostradamus
The publics intuition mixed with my opinion's just more confirmation on the subject, don't want it
Pull your card, I'll pull no punches
A monkey wrench in a dysfunction now

[Hook]

[Intro: Lil Uzi Vert]
I'm a rockstar, smash my guitar
Diamonds on my fist and on my arms
Meek and I don't dress the same, relate in Goyard
Frostbite on my pinky ring, watch me flex on y'all

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I get it now, these niggas mad that she chose the kid, hey
I'm ball in NY,  Derrick Rose this shit, hey
I roll around town in a Rolls and shit
I got that bag and we movin' that snow
Like it's Christmas and Santa, got hoes and shit
Hundred K large on my Audemar
When we run down we hit one of y'all
I'mma post up at the corner store
Trappin' all night but I shine like I'm Armor All
I am so hot I might break the thermometer
Coppers they watch us and follow us
Flip through that paper no calendar
All of these jewels like I celebrate Hanukkah
I got a different kind of money
I'm on a different kind of grind
I'm with some different type of niggas
We on a different type of time
Go get the money fuck them bitches
Bitches be gettin' out of line
I turned that one into a two
I turned that point into a nine
Hey, hey, hey, hey, aye

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
You know how froze that is, aye
Look at my neck, damn, aye
You know how froze that is, aye
Look at my wrist, uh, yea
You know how froze that is, aye
Look at my fist, uh, yea
You know how froze that is, aye

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
Skrrrt, driving around in a Bentley, ya
Following Meek and lil' Nicki, ya
It is just me and lil' Brittney, ya
Diamonds so wet you could slip in, ay
Look at the bitch, take a picture
She is just so photogenic, yea
She ride my dick like a dirt bike
You know she gon' pop a wheelie, yea
Count my money to a milli, yea
Drive a Porsche all up in Philly
Holding that gun with no holster
Diamonds and Rollie get coolie

[Bridge 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
I'm a rockstar smash my guitar
Diamonds on my fist and on my arms
Meek and I don't dress the same, relate in Goyard
Frostbite on my pinky ring, watch me flex on y'all

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
I get it now dudes is mad at these 80 M's
Twenty twelve I was balling like Tom Brady then
Movie, I'm living through these Scorsese lens
Get at me, and deep-throat a three-eighty gun
Pussy wet, Swiffer jet, come through on that bigger jet
We land in them new ports, no babe not cigarettes
Clear ports, air force, sweats on with a big diamond
Make niggas stare at my hand even though I am not mimin'
Different type of money, you on a different type of broke
Any of you bitches say Nicki, you on a different type of coke
I just be sittin' in the mansion, takin' a dip inside the pool
We don't go out without assassins
We on some different type of rules, uhh

[Bridge 2: Nicki Minaj]
I'm a rockstar, scratch my guitar
Diamonds on my ring and on my arms
Meek and I still live together, relate in Goyard
Frostbite on my pussy ring, watch me flex on y'all

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
You know how froze that is, aye
Look at my neck, damn, aye
You know how froze that is, aye
Look at my wrist, uh, yea

Look at my neck, damn, aye
You know how froze that is, aye
Look at my wrist, uh, yea
You know how froze that is, aye
Look at my fist, uh, yea
You know how froze that is, aye

[Verse]
Close your eyes now, shut them tight
Maybe you'll sleep right through the night
And perhaps the visions that plague your mind
For one merciful night, will finally subside
Of a corridor lined with portraits of you
That're screaming your name, as you look for the room
Where you left your phone and your reptile mask
Your blood diamond scarab and human hair hat
As you're frantically scanning your spherical map
Which suddenly morphs into the face of your dad
Shaking his head in the far right field stands
And you realize your penis has become detached
You discover the circuitry under your skin
At the moment the orgy's supposed to begin
All your coworkers are waiting for you to start
Except now you're all standing in your childhood yard
And they're pointing at the pile of birds in the yard
That you hid behind the shed in the corner of the yard
The dead birds you collected and hid in the yard
That your neighbor set fire to in the corner of the yard
Oh, the smell of dead birds that are burning in the yard
The pile of dead birds that you worked on so hard
And you grab your mom's shin and you beg her for help
And she tells you that bird burning boys go to hell
Before maggots erupt from a crease in the sheets
Which are suddenly a patchwork of Lunchable meats
That a man dressed in white lies says backwards to eat
Or you'll have to sing Stephen Colbert right to sleep
For millions of people on national TV
And you're standing stark naked covered with tattoos
You have no recollection of agreeing to
And the audience gets bored and they all start to boo (this sucks)
You forget how to walk and your teeth become loose
You're telling strange people this isn't your life
Or maybe, sweet one, you won't have nightmares tonight

[Chorus]
Creep up on these niggas, creep up on these niggas
Speak up on it, nigga, speak up on it, nigga
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everythang
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everythang
Gon' make it bang, gon' make it bang
Getting followed by them hollows, gon' make it bang
Niggas ain't been to church in a minute
But it's funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious
Amen, amen, hey
Waving at these niggas, hey
Start waving at these niggas, amen, hey
Waving at these niggas, hey

[Verse]
Ugh! Sawed-off shotty, Reebok pump a nigga
I Kirk out for them Franklins, I stomp a nigga
Virginia mind, I dump on 'em and throw the gun away
The shoe fits weird, nigga, now run them Penny Hardaways
You can't have a conscience when you a god, nigga
What the fuck is a city to a Godzilla?
Okay, now everybody tough, everybody buff
Tell you, "Shoot at they feet," and watch them double Dutch
Oh, no, then dance, little nigga, dance, little nigga
You by yourself now, what's the plan, little nigga?
Gon' make it bang, go and make it bang
Pusha just want the money, I'm takin' everythang
Hand me the ratchet, put everythang in the basket
All of the paper and plastic, hollows, I'm givin' them out
Run in your house, stickin' a gun in your mouth
Niggas turn religious when they starin' at the devil
Pull that trigger, chopper Rocky like I'm playin' heavy metal, ah

[Chorus]
Creep up on these niggas, creep up on these niggas
Speak up on it, nigga, speak up on it, nigga
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everythang
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everythang
Gon' make it bang, gon' make it bang
Getting followed by them hollows, gon' make it bang
Niggas ain't been to church in a minute
But it's funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious
Amen, amen, hey
Waving at these niggas, hey
Start waving at these niggas, amen, hey
Waving at these niggas, hey

[Verse 1]
Bad intentions you bring
No religion that you follow
Still you bullshit for boys in love
You're so blind to see that enough is enough
I don't concern myself too much
I'll awake when my time is arrived
When all is said and done
Tonight well
I can't feel my heart
Cause you leach off to many hearts
Well it's safe to say
That I've had enough of troubled thoughts in my mind
I should try to pray for my demise, ohhh-ohh

[Hook]
What's the point of wasting love on you?
Your indecisive choices lead you here
I walk with a dead and frozen heart
Decide to restrain from attaining scars
Neither of us admit to our faults
Which led to our fall

[Verse 2]
Tell me what you see in this mirror that you're lookin', baby
You're so ashamed, I see it in the look in your eyes
You're afraid, I wanna show you what's inside of you
Let me enter your brain now
Pardon me, I only see your reflection, but you
Best believe this is a fuckin' test of
What you do, oh you know what you do
I'ma let you solve your own clues
Baby the hardest part is the will to come in
I know you lost respect for me
Say that you did
Could you give me one last kiss
So I could learn to feel again
Make me regret everything that I've done
And love again, love again

[Hook]
What's the point of wasting love on you?
Your indecisive choices lead you here
I walk with a dead and frozen heart
Decide to restrain from attaining scars
Neither of us admit to our faults
Which led to our fall

[Outro]
Why don't you run away, run away from him
And come running to me when you're on your knees
Cause I will give the right solution
I can do is love you one last time
Just to recollect memories in our mind
When everything is done don't act like you know me so well
I'll just be someone that you used to know

[Intro]

[Skit]
Steph, your first year, you won twenty-six games
Your second year, you win thirty-six
You talked about the changing perception of what it meant to be a Warrior
What does it mean now?
World Champs
Uh, this is truly special
This group is a special group from the time we started the season
This is what we envisioned and a lot of hard work goes into it
And all the way down to the last minute of this game
This is what it's all about
To have our families here
All the team coaches, everyone be a part of it
We're gonna remember this for a long time

[Intro: Rihanna & Kanye West]
Man, I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
Woo, woo
Swizz told me let the beat rock (Oh)
Oh

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Swizz Beatz]
For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous (Goddamn)
I made that bitch famous
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous (Goddamn)
They mad they still nameless (Talk that talk, man)
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous (Goddamn)
Yeah, we still hood famous

[Chorus: Rihanna & Swizz Beatz]
I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
Wake up, Mr. West! Oh, he's up!
I just wanted you to know

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Swizz Beatz]
I be Puerto Rican day parade floatin'
That Benz Marina Del Rey coastin'
She in school to be a real estate agent
Last month I helped her with the car payment
Young and we alive, whoo!
We never gonna die, whoo!
I just copped a jet to fly over personal debt
Put one up in the sky
The sun is in my eyes, whoo!
Woke up and felt the vibe, whoo!
No matter how hard they try, whoo!
We never gonna die

[Chorus: Rihanna & Swizz Beatz]
I just wanted you to know
Get 'em!

If I don't turn to you
Nothin' unwanted
No other help I know

[Chorus: Kanye West & Pastor T.L. Barrett / Choir]
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
Who can I turn to?
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
After all, who can I turn to?
If I ever instigated, I am sorry
If I don't turn to you
Tell me who in here could relate, I-I-I
No other help I know, I stretch my hands

[Intro: Rick Ross]
I'ma tell you like this, nigga

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I got a hundred Gs on my line
I ain't eatin' Jacksons when I be in Overtown
Bitch I'm eatin' lavish, look up, ho, it's snowin' now
I just throw the cabbage, J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League gon' hold it down
Got a odor there in the attic, that's a couple pounds
New Rolex that I ordered, that's a hundred thou'
Time to milk the game, bitch I went and bought a cow
My nigga GDK a goon, he'll gun you down
Slid up on him with the stick, yeah and sat him down
My nigga Nut so slick, they ain't pat him down
I got a hundred niggas on my line
A hundred squares at a time, nigga, hold it down

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that
I'm gettin' them stacks, it's more addictive than crack
I'm addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that
I'm gettin' them stacks, it's more addictive than crack

[Verse 2: Drake]
Alright my patience runnin' thin
Olympic pools of money, I'm just glad I learned to swim
Cannonball, bitch, I hope your diving board's sturdy
And I hope when dinner's cold, my niggas do not desert me
Nah, but shit's all good
The deal got signed and my split's all good
And these haters pretendin' that it's all good
Say that shit in person, man I wish y'all would
I say you lucky if your father was a figure
Cause my uncle was my father and my father was my nigga
And my mother so proud cause his son is gettin' bigger
I took time to load the bullets, now I'm 'bout to pull the trigger
Like boom, boom, boom, I'm a genius, god dammit
I ain't the type to murder you, I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat if you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket and these rappers in a panic
But Skinny told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could've fooled me
Yeah, nd to my city I'm the two-three
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname Starter-Drake
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break
And these other lames is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen I could draw attention
But you can tell by my strut
I'm just chillin' in the cut, nigga what, and I'm feelin' like

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that
I'm gettin' them stacks, it's more addictive than crack
I'm addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that
I'm gettin' them stacks, it's more addictive than crack

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Five niggas, counted five niggas, all inside of that roller coaster
Loop-de-loop, over and over
Dope Francis, pullin' Drogas
Shaka Zulu in the tub, holdin' toasters, nigga what?
In the club, on the sofa, on the wall he got two chains
On her titties boy, that's a motorboat or
You can go with Noah or go overboard or
Life of Pi, so crazy, Silver Surfer, so wavy
Beat Army, go Navy, so cool, go baby
Gold and blue, so navy, old school, I'm so 80's
Drop verses, top earnin', convert a bird and I'm so Shady
Keith Richards, I'm no Grady
I'm all tsunami, can't point break me
I'm so

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Lupeland, carnival, Barnum & Bailey pardon you
Replace car with barre, barnival
Lose control, bumper car or two, lose control
Like funnel cake from that fun house, you lose an arm or two
Doin' battle with the bottles like a baller too
Like a carnivore at a bar-b-que
Art of war, arsenal
I'm level four and your armor two
Nigga that don't match, armadillo
That don't rap, what's wrong with you, that's detrimental
Homeboy, residential mind state
Existential Rolex, Presidential, time waits
For no man that I've ever met
Tell him no standard that I've ever set
Live right now like it's better yet
Treat a trash can like a treasure chest
Don't jump ship for a better deck
Or dump chips on a better bet
Don't change gangs for a less set
Full of fake niggas to get better checks
When it's real niggas that ain't never never left
Their good ghetto for a better mess
And my father told me just die well
So I'ma do my best to have a better death
And give a lot cause your deeds speak when you resurrect
Bout revolution ain't ready yet
But you don't never know so don't ever guess on letter X
Lupeland, freak show, eyes all in that peep hole
You believe that you know that girl but I don't really think so

[Hook: Future + Lupe Fiasco]
I don't want no problems
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I don't want no problems
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'

[Outro]
Paris skirt in her Paris heels
Where we at? Where is real?
Lupeland, cotton candy, carousals, ferris wheels
I don't want no problems
I don't want no problems
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I'm just playin', I'm gon' kill em'
Where your niggas?
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'

I'm hot shit, flies, I wanna be in the cockpit
Big money, talking loud, and obnoxious
I'm obsessed, with success, it ain't stopped yet
Flow sick, nauseous, me lose?, propostrous
Now I finally realize the game's object
Swine dive off of my pedastal in the moshpit
Diamonds in my chain and bezel have me, frostbit
Shining right before the world, like you don't call shit
Stepping off of my big bus, fuck you thought?
That I pull up in a Honda Accord, you throwed off
I'm a boss bitch, beyond rich, get it right
What you need to retire, I'll prolly get it tonight
But God did it, day I was born, I started winning
Was hard to dodge prison, but still the stars risen
I don't hold grudges judge, all forgiven
But still I ball heavy until I'm called to heaven

As it turns out, until the sun burns out
I'll be here teaching you how to ball, if you could learn how
Bird bitches riding with me, early with my worm out
Suckers them don't worry me, haters, I ain't conerned 'bout
From now to infity, you know Tip'll be
In that new Bentley serving misery to enemies
Just see me living at the top, when you envision me
And catch an old bleed, tryna visit me
Is it he who push it and never did it forever
Rather the storm sand, it still wasn't dust settle
Haters giving him grief, they oughta give him a medal
You beefin' with him better dig a hole, get a shovel
Middle finger to devil, killing the basic treble
All he knows all go, no brake pedals
Still elevating, evolve, if you hate the way that he ball
I hate to break it to you, I got bad news for y'all

[Hook]

They patiently waiting for the day the Lord take away the shine
But mine eternal, ain't no expiration date
Countrary to what all popular conversations say
I'm still Father times, most praised, protege
Man you'll be lucky to get the shit that I throw away
I'm La Familia get nothing but a Maury
Spanish bitches call me pretty boy Horhe
Cold with it, got juice like sorbet
Two a day, sold out, pockets bank, rolled out
I live in a big house, you live on a fold out
Bad bitches with me, belly buttons and they toes out
Red bottoms on 'em, son it's something you should know about
Time don't wait, I'ma shine, don't hate
Long as it's ticking, I be getting mine all day
Aye, I'ma shine, don't hate
Long as it's ticking, I be getting mine all day

[Intro: Sy Ari da Kid]
Hey Mane, this the squad
Fo' number's, three letters
Mo' money, mo' bitches

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Your nigga's a pussy, we smack him around
Pull out my pistol, I’m backing him down
Running your mouth, and I’ll run in your house
Called out my name, so I'm jerkin' you down
You buyin' a ounce, and you breaking it down
Hop in the house, and I'm burning it down
You walking away while I'm talking to you
Well, this A.K will hit you and turn you around
Desert'll hit you and take off a leg
Step on ya' fingers to get to the bread
Came from the country, I served him a dummy
That's why I keep Tommy guns right by the bed
Hit in the head for something you said
Torture a nigga, I wanted him to beg
You leave me no options, you telling the feds
The 'partment was white, but I painted it red
Fuck a regret when you deep in my debt
You love her so much, then cut me a check
Pay me respect or I'm slicing your neck
Came on the 'crest and got shot in the chest
Cut off your finger and cut off your thumb
And now I want you niggas to throw up your set
Killing the driver and shooting the passenger
Back seat niggas can get all the rest

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
Brick Squad for life nigga, inked it in my flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
Brick Squad for life nigga, inked it in our flesh

[Verse 2: Sy Ari da Kid]
I told my nigga dissect the beef, and eat that nigga flesh
Cold world, I can see that nigga breath
School of hard knocks, got my heater on my desk
Getting head from a student while I'm cheating on my test
No beginning, it's the end of you
Burner on me, raising temperatures
You are not a fucking killer
But God I know all my nigga perpendicular
Back when niggas was a youngin, and you was the lamest
See, yeah, I remember ya'
Facts upon me, no servina
Serve a nigga, no subpoena
No nigga, I ain’t no killer, but don’t push me
Came in the game, we got good seats
Real nigga know it ain’t squashing no hood beef
What nigga? Don’t front nigga, you a fuck nigga, sup nigga
Free my nigga Rido, and R.I.P to Dunk nigga

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
Brick Squad for life nigga, inked it in my flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
Brick Squad for life nigga, inked it in our flesh

[Bridge: Waka Flocka Flame]
I don’t owe you niggas shit, fuck favors
$64,000 for this rollie, fuck the haters
I, I don’t owe you niggas shit, fuck favors
$64,000 for this rollie, fuck the haters

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
Brick Squad for life nigga, inked it in my flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you ain't seen my best
Checkmate, ain't a game of chess
Globalists see me as a threat
Free thinking, got a world at my neck
Hah, am I paranoid? Picture Malcolm X
In a room full of pigs, trying not to bust a sweat
Aye, Neil Tyson need to loosen up his vest
They probably write that man one hell of a check
Aye, I'm over here on this side of town
Come on over, over, over, over here, try to clown
Aye, I never pipe down
If they weren't coming for me then
They definitely coming for me now
I can't even keep my phone charged up
All this shit I'm talking, I should get my home barred up
Rappers get off of my dick and get your own bars up
Now the mirror lizard's breath got the clones scared cuz
Woo, use your, use your common sense
Why is NASA part of the department of defense?
They divided up the seas into thirty-three degrees
Feeding kids masonry, bruh, be careful what you read

[Hook 1]
Flat line, flat line
There's no superior blood line
Flat line, flat line
You got me once but that died, aye

[Verse 2]
Voice, voice, do I have a voice?
Do I give a fuck? Do I have a choice?
Joint, joint, I roll up a joint
Keep my shooters in the game like I hate to disappoint
I see only good things on the horizon
That's probably why the horizon is always rising
Indoctrinated in a cult called science
And graduated to a club full of liars
Heliocentrism, you were the sixth victim
Fuck you and your team, you can sit on the bench with 'em
They nervous, but before you try to curve it
Do your research on David Irving
Stalin was way worse than Hitler
That's why the POTUS gotta wear a kippah
I'm a man first 'fore an artist
Get a lawyer, look up Doctor Richard Sauder

[Hook 2]
Flat line
You fooled us for the last time
Flat line, flat line
There's no superior blood line

[Interlude: Neil Tyson]
So you want to find the farthest point from that center. And it turns out sea level at the equator is farther away from the center of the Earth than sea level near the poles. It has nothing to do with global warming and melting of the ice caps

(Why is that?)

Because... Earth, we know it spins, once a.... day. Yes, thank you. Three people know that, how long a day lasts here

(Good for row number two, they're off to a great start)

So you, so you spin, you know when you spin pizza dough, it kind of flattens out. It gets wider in the middle and...so Earth, throughout its life, even when it formed, it was spinning, and it got a little wider at the equator than it does at the poles. So it's not actually a sphere, it's an...it's oblate, it's officially an oblate spheroid. That's what we call it. But not only that, it's slightly wider below the equator than above the equator

(A little chubbier?)

Little chubbier, chubby's a good word, it's like pear-shaped. So it turns out the pear-shapedness is bigger than the height of Mount Everest above sea level

[Hook 2]
Flat line
You fooled us for the last time
Flat line, flat line
There's no superior blood line
Dead

They landed at Plymouth
With a smile on their face

[Verse]
My whole disposition like fuck who told me to sit
Ten toes on the cement, lil weed in my socks
Sin - do songs to repent, clean up my thoughts
We in a box, see a lot of niggas talk on the bench
A lotta father figures followin' trends, I ain't involved with 'em
Lemmings like to fall off of cliffs and bring they squad with 'em
I seen God in the mirror drinking, I tee off when the spirit hit me
And I don't fear the ending, I feel the envy
I listen to my past when it whisper to me
Half of it makes sense, my nigga half of it riddles to me
Moses with a makeshift staff sending ripples through ya
And through the land, and the river been a plan
But when I go to grab it, it slither out my hand
So on my other hand, I been handling business
Kinda shabby but my momma told me "Man up, my nigga"
And now I'm Popeye with the anchor tats and the spinach
Finna spazz on a nigga if I have to
Risk takers know Satan knew dance moves
It could be your last move
Hard to see the glass half full, when you don't have food
Wrist dangling like black fruit, nigga

[Outro]
Crossing all my T's
And I'm dotting all my I's
Gotta watch out for debris
When it's fallin' down
As far as I can see
I done confronted all the shit
I couldn't walk around
Keep a piece when you on the ground
Leakin', you hard as Hell
Keep some wind in my sails
Walkin' down La Brea
Name ringin' bells like we got some mail

So why send oppression, not blessings?
Why, oh, why'd You do me wrong? (More)
You persecute the weak
Because it makes You feel so strong (Safe)
Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light (War)
To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, 'cause I know that You'll make everything alright
And I know that You'll take good care of Your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
'Cause I, I look to the light

[Bridge: Chance The Rapper]
When they come for You, I will shield Your name
I will field their questions, I will feel Your pain

Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean, I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made “Sunday Candy,” I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said, "Let's do a good ass job with 'Chance 3'"
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride, I'ma still give 'em raincoats
Know what God said when He made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil' Chano from 79th

[Outro: Kirk Franklin & Choir]
Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feel that they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said "I'm sorry" too many times
You can never go too far when you can't come back home again
That's why I need...
Faith, more, safe, war

The other night

Held you in my arms
But when I woke up this morning

Oh niggas must think I'm not petty cause I'm the best that's ever made music

Like, oh that's Ye and I can put his wife's initials on my twitter   @Wizkhalifa

Bro first of all you stole your whole shit from Cudi

Second, your first single was corny as fuck and most there after

Work hard play hardYou have distracted from my creative process

I went to look at your twitter and you were wearing cool pants

I screen grabbed those pants and sent it to my style team #Wizwearscoolpants

3rd no one I know has ever listened to one of your albums all the way through

4th you let a stripper trap you

5th    I know you mad every time you look at your child that this girl got you for 18 years

6th  don't ever come out the side of your neck at me
7th I am your OG    and I will be respected as such

8th  I made it so we could wear tight jeans

9th   me and Cudi created this shit

10th   don't you ever in your fucking life speak sideways about a nigga that's fighting for us    I do this for all of us

11th   I showed you respect as a man when I met you

12th   You wouldn't have a child if it wasn't for me

13th   You own waves????  I own your child!!!!

[Intro: YG]
Mustard on the beat, ho!

[Verse 1]
I was good on my own, that's the way it was
That's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded fuck
On some faded love
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded, huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I'll give it to you

[Pre-Chorus]
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it

[Chorus]
You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me

[Verse 2]
You been rollin' around, shit I'm rollin' up
Light and roll it up
Break it down, like a pound, shit was never us
Shit was never us
That's the real, on the real, are you serious?
How you feel, how you feel?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to ya
Had some fun on the run though, I'll give it to ya

[Pre-Chorus]
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it

[Chorus]
You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I ain't tryna think about it, no
Yeah, I said it, boy, get up inside it
I want you to homicide it
Go in slow, but I want you to pipe it
And I think I kinda like ya
Up against the wall, we don't need a title

[Chorus]
Yeah, I said it
Yeah, I said it, bae
Yeah, I said it, man, fuck a title

[Verse 2]
Boy, I always like to show
Get a little bit, come a little close, now
Take it home on your camera phone
Get a little bad, nigga, watch me blow it down

[Chorus]
Yeah, I said it
Yeah, I said it, bae
Yeah, I said it
Ooh
Yeah, I said it
Yeah, I said it, bae
Yeah, I said it
Ooh

[Bridge]
You can be rough, boy, but you won't
Give me some love, boy, give it to me 'til the morn'

[Chorus]
Yeah, I said it
Yeah, I said it, babe
Yeah, I said it, uh
Yeah, I said it
Yeah, I said it, babe
Yeah, I said it

[Verse 1]
I can just hear them now
"How could you let us down?"
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way around
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
Worried 'bout every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus 1]
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
Well, I don’t care I’m in love
(Stop before it’s too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s not too late)
(I know there’s too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don’t know why it’s happening
(Stop while it’s not too late)
And I still don’t know

[Verse 2]
Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
Point is I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus 1]
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I don’t care I’m in love
(Stop before it’s too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how do I know that it's right?
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s not too late)

[Bridge]
And I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain’t so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as it gets
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets

[Chorus 2]
Feel like a brand new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like
(Stop before it's too late)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
In a new direction
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how will I know I've gone too far?
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
And I know it's hard to describe
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
(But you make the same old mistakes)
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)
I finally know what it's like
(Stop before it’s too late)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)

[Intro]
Ooh
Oh

[Verse 1]
Ghost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I separate from here and now

[Break]
Ooh
Oh

[Verse 2]
A drug and a dream
A lost connection, oh, come back to me
So I can feel alive again
As soul and body try to mend

[Chorus]
It's pulling me apart, this time
Everything is never-ending
I slipped into a parallel
They'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
Why does it have to feel so strange
To be in love again, be in love again, be in love again?

[Verse 3]
Ghost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I separate from here and now

[Break]
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

[Chorus]
It's pulling me apart, this time
Everything is never-ending
I slipped into a parallel
They'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
Why does it have to feel so strange
To be in love again, be in love again, be in love again?

[Verse 1]
Nothing but a tear, that's all for breakfast
Watching you pretend you're unaffected
You're pulling our connections, expecting me to let you go
But I won't

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you don't need my protection
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction, hoping that the message goes

[Chorus]
Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close if they hurt you, you wouldn't find out
Just say now, I'm coming right now to be close to you

[Verse 2]
Said you let it go, you kept it
Working hard to perfect it
But now your fear is reckless, and it's out of your control
Well just let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you don't need my protection
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction, hoping that the message goes

[Chorus]
Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close, if they hurt you, you wouldn't find out
If you let me, I'd be there by now
Close to you

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
First of all, I would like to start by saying
I'm the motherfucking man, just thought I'd let you niggas know, hear me?
If the shit hit the fan and these rappers start
The pen coming at you niggas' throats, hear me?
Do it big out in Cannes
At the film festival, nigga, every year I go, hear me?
Big dick, that's my man
Keep forty bitches round, bring 'em everywhere I go
Hear me? Hear me? Chilling on a boat
In the south of France, island happened off the coast
Saint-Tropez when I'm waving to the folks
Got the young trap lord with me looking like the Pope, hear me?
Grew up living broke
Before we'd seen it all, niggas had to dream it all
Don't you compare me cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they feel me
They don't feel me but they feel me, they hear me

[Hook: A$AP Rocky & Pharrell]
Hear me?
Young niggas doing what it takes to survive
Hear me?
Young niggas only pay attention if it's fly
Hear me?
All I ever hope to do is prosper when I strive
Hear me?
If they ain't playing in the game then they hating on the side
Hear me?

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Black dark shades, black leather jacket
Bad chick on my arm got me looking like The Fonz, hear me?
We the champions and about to get a ring same size as LeBron's, hear me? Hear me?
Yeah, life is a bitch and it's no holds barred, every man for themselves, hear me? Hear me?
And if you ain't a man and your name ain't Solange
Keep your hands to yourself, hear me?
But I don't know them grown folks' business
The thoughts that they plant like it's photosynthe-sis
In your bits, put their nose all in it
I bring 'em to the light with my photogenics
Hear me? Fuck all those critics
If Flacko on the booth, that mean a killer on the loose, ooh
Don't you compare me cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they feel me
They don't feel me but they fear me, they hear me

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
Hear me? Hear me?
Young niggas doing what it takes to survive
Hear me? Hear me?
Young niggas only pay attention if it's fly
Hear me? Hear me?
All I ever hope to do is prosper when I strive
Hear me?
If they ain't playing in the game then they hating on the side

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, third verse, turn to third gear
I left a couple things out like the third wheel
These niggas lying on tracks without a third rail
Cause yeah, I'm only stating facts when I'm saying on wax
In your ear like I'm cleaning out the wax
They don't hear me like they're deaf, "it was wack", was dirt there?
Hear me? Yes, I gotta talk about the trap
Matter of fact, let me talk about rap cause I've served here
Yeah, hear me? Hear me?
Man, fuck the bullshit cause now I'm in my zone, hear me? Hear me?
I hear the same bullshit in every other song, hear me?
So I try to give 'em something different, listen when I'm on, hear me? Hear me?
Saddest thing about it is they only pay attention and they miss you when you're gone, hear me? Hear me?

[Verse 1]
Desperado
Sittin' in an old Monte Carlo
A man whose heart is hollow
Mhm, take it easy
I'm not tryna go against yuh
Actually, I'm goin' witcha

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta get up out of here
And yuh ain't leavin' me behind
I know you won't cause we share common interests
You need me, there ain't no leaving me behind
Never, no, no, I just want outta here, yeah
Once I'm gone, ain’t no going back

[Chorus]
If you want, we can be runaways
Running from any sight of love
Yeah, yeah, there ain’t nothin'
There ain't nothin' here for me
There ain't nothin' here for me anymore
But I don't wanna be alone

[Verse 2]
Desperado
Sitting on your ole' Monte Carlo
We've both had our hearts broke
Unh, hunh, take it easy
I'm not tryna go against yuh
I can be a lone wolf witcha

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta get up out of here
And you ain't leaving me behind
I know you won't cause we share common interests
You need me, there ain't no leaving me behind
Never, no, no, both want outta here, yeah
Once we're gone, ain’t no going back

[Bridge]
Dear desperado
Yeah, I don't wanna be alone
Dear desperado
Yeah, I don't wanna be alone

[Chorus]
If you want, we can be runaways
Running from any sight of love
Yeah, yeah, there ain’t nothin'
There ain't nothin' here for me
There ain't nothin' here for me anymore
But I don't wanna be alone

Aw yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
I bet she could never make you cry
‘Cause the scars on your heart are still mine
Tell me that she couldn't get this deep
She can almost be the worst of me
Too bad she's just eating off your dreams
Let me know when you're ready to bleed
Baby you just need to send for me

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Send for me, send for me
Send for me, send for me

[Refrain: Travis Scott]
Woo
Woo, woo, yeah
Woo, woo, yeah
Aw yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
I've been thinking 'bout you late at night
I've been thinking only of you
Ain't nothing else to really talk about
Boy show me what you want to do
These days you've been feeling lonely
Yeah I've been feeling lonely too
I'ma fuck it up, won't you show me some
Run it back like you owe me some

[Refrain: Travis Scott (& Rihanna)]
Woo

Aw yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah

[Verse 3: Rihanna]
Tell me 'bout your picture-perfect love
Tell me how you think without the drugs
Maybe you just need to send for me
I don't mean to really love ya
I don't mean to even care about ya
I don't mean to really love ya
I don't mean to really care about ya, no more
I don't mean to really care about ya, no more

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Send for me, send for me
Send for me, send for me

Aw yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
I came fluttering in from Neverland
Time can never stop me, no, no, no, no
I know you've tried to
I came riding in on a pale white horse
Handing out highs to less fortunate
I do advise you
Run it back, run it on back
When you breaking it down for me
Cause I can't hear you, two times
Run it on back, will it ever make sense to me?

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I got to do things my own way darling
Will you ever let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?

[Post-Chorus: SZA]
When I look outside my window
I can't get no piece of mind
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Let me cover your shit in glitter
I could make it gold, gold
Heard you tryna sell your soul, baby
Word on the street, you run it low lately
I needed you to please give my reflection a break
From the face it’s seeing now
Ooh darling, gahhlee
Would you mind giving my reflection a break
From the pain it’s feeling now?

[Chorus: Rihanna & SZA]
I got to do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?

[Post-Chorus: SZA]
When I look outside my window
I can't get no piece of mind
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind

[Outro: SZA (Rihanna)]
Get no piece
Get no peace
Get, get, getting no peace
Can't get no peace
(Get, g-g-get no peace oh)

[Intro]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh shit

[Chorus]
Sex with me, so amazing

Sex with me, so amazing
Sex with me, so amazing

[Verse 1]
Vodka and water, and a lemon
And a few other things I cannot mention
Oh-na-na-na-na
Five fingers on it (five fingers)
Hit it like you own it, I’ma hit it like I’m on it
Straight shots of the blue dot
(Shots, shots, shots, shots)
Baby, I’ma pick your  poison
Oh-we, ah-yeah, you gon’ need it

I’ma get it wet like jacuzzi, ah-yea

[Chorus 2]
And sex with me, so amazing

Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Sex with me, sex with me, sex with me
So amazing, so amazing, mmmm

[Verse 2]
You know I got the sauce (sauce), you know I’m saucy
And it’s always wet, a bitch never ever had to use lip gloss on it
I’ma need you deeper than six, it's not a coffin
We’re not making love, tryna get nasty
Wrap up your drugs, come make me happy
Sex with me is amazing, with her it’ll feel alright
The sex doesn’t get any better, make it long, let it be all night
I know, I know, I make it hard to let go
Tonight, all night, I’m Monroe
Even if I’m alone

[Chorus]
Sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Hit a switch on a fake nigga, like a station
Sex with me, sex with me, sex with me
So amazing, so amazing, mmmm

Sex with me, so amazing
Sex with me so amazing
(This is the best there is)

Versace on my belt, Burberry cologne

Niggas looking at me, I make it go in
Choppa make them do the fuckin' running man dance
Niggas talking on the low, they talking bout that guap
A hundred thousand, they about fifty blocks
I'm getting money every day, I'm screaming fuck the cops
And SOD the gang, y'all niggas ain't in my lane
I'm switchin lanes up in that Masi fuck the paperazi
I park my car to fuck yo bitch, I hit her in my Masi

[Verse 1]
Look at what you've done
Stand still, fallin' away from me
When it takes so long
Fire's out, what do you want to be?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm holdin’ on
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now, every other day I'll be watching you

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
Oh-oh
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside

[Beat Break]

[Verse 2]
So you give me no reason
For me to stay close to you
Tell me what lovers do
How are we still breathing?
It's never for us to choose
I'll be the strength in you

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm holdin' on (I'm holdin' on)
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now, every other day I'll be watching you

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside (i-ide)
I'll show you what it feels like (i-ike)
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside (i-ide)
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside

[Beat Break]

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game, stop the talk show
Product of what you're taught to know
Forfeit the game, 'cause tomorrow
When it's all done, you reap what you sow

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life, my pride is broken

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
You live what you learn
You have to act like you're someone
You live what you learn
You want someone to hurt like you
You live what you learn
You want to share what you've been through
You live what you learn

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
You love the things I say I do
The way I hurt myself again, just to get back at you
You take away, when I give in
My life, my pride is broken

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
You live what you've learned
You have to act like you're someone
You live what you've learned
You want someone to hurt like you
You live what you've learned
You want to share what you have been through
You live what you've learned

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game, stop the talk show
Product of what you're taught to know
Forfeit the game, 'cause tomorrow
When it's all done, you reap what you sow
Forfeit the game, stop the talk show
Product of what you're taught to know
Forfeit the game, 'cause tomorrow
When it's all done, you reap what you sow

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
You like to think you're never wrong
You live what you've learned
You have to act like you're someone
You live what you've learned
You want someone to hurt like you
You live what you've learned
You want to share what you have been through
You live what you've learned
You like to think you're never wrong (Forfeit the game)
You live what you've learned
You have to act like you're someone (Forfeit the game)
You live what you've learned
You want someone to hurt like you (Forfeit the game)
You live what you've learned
You want to share what you have been through
You live what you've learned

[Verse 1]
My girl might leave me if she hears about this
LA confidential, LA confidential
I hope she never has to hear about this
LA confidential, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause you know I got somebody
So I can't fuck with just anybody
But sometimes I get lonely, I get lonely
So let me keep it real with you, real with you
Can't keep it real with me, real with me
When I get lonely, I get lonely

[Post-Chorus]
Now and again, and again, and again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again, and again

[Verse 2]
And I hope you don't expect to be my girlfriend
LA confidential, LA confidential
'Cause I think you know I'd never leave my girlfriend
LA confidential, alright

[Chorus]
'Cause you know I got somebody
So I can't fuck with just anybody
But sometimes I get lonely, I get lonely
So let me keep it real with you, real with you
Can't keep it real with me, real with me
When I get lonely, I get lonely

[Verse 3]
I know we fuck around but I can not get with you baby
I be on my own shit, moving acting different baby
I be in the city baby, the city baby
So when I'm with my hoes I ask that you don't act like you've been fucking with me baby
LAX, LA sex I get at you for
I run time, it's your nigga come get at the boy
I got a girl but I'm still trying to fuck
Long as you know that what's up
I hope you know that's what's up

[Chorus]
I got somebody
So I can't fuck with just anybody
But sometimes I get lonely, I get lonely
So let me keep it real with you, real with you
Can't keep it real with me, real with me
When I get lonely, I get lonely

[Post-Chorus]
Now and again, and again, and again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again, and again

[Verse 1]
Oh, I wanna be with you
Oh, I know you want me too

[Pre-Chorus]
So can I get a toot toot for the lovers tonight
Toot toot love when it's just right?
Toot toot, it's about to go down
So here we go, here we go now

[Chorus]
Why you gotta feel so right?
Why you gotta, why you gotta leave me open wide?
Love it when you love me right
Why you gotta, why you gotta take over my mind?
Every time, why you gotta take over my mind?
Every time, why you gotta leave me hypnotized?
Hoola lalala hoola lalala
Hoola lalala lalalala
Hoola lalala hoola lalala
Hoola lalala

[Verse 2]
Oh, you got me in your palms (hands)
But I want, want you in my arms, yeah

Toot toot, it's about to go down
So here we go, here we go now

[Chorus]
Why you gotta feel so right?
Why you gotta, why you gotta leave me open wide?
Love it when you love me right
Why you gotta, why you gotta take over my mind?
Every time, why you gotta take over my mind?
Every time, why you gotta leave me hypnotized?

Hoola lalala hoola lalala
Hoola lalala lalalala
Hoola lalala hoola lalala
Hoola lalala

[Bridge]
You got my mind, girl, spinning 'round and 'round
You got it spinning
So far away, girl, where it can't be found
Just go and admit

[Pre-Chorus]
Toot toot for the lovers tonight
Toot toot love when it's just right?
Toot toot, it's about to go down
So here we go, here we go now

[Chorus]
Why you gotta feel so right?
Why you gotta, why you gotta leave me open wide?
Love it when you love me right
Why you gotta, why you gotta take over my mind?
Every time, why you gotta take over my mind?
Every time, why you gotta leave me hypnotized?
Hoola lalala hoola lalala
Hoola lalala lalalala
Hoola lalala hoola lalala

[Hook: Mike Slap]
Last night the skies turned purple and
Past lives in light tunnels
Light tunnels

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
In the back of a town car, staring at myself in a tux
Maneuvering through the people out front
Police barricade, orange cones and we're stuck
Twenty minutes late and my manager blowing me up
Security guard in the garage at the entrance
We roll down the window and show him our credentials
Terrell flash the pass and he lets us continue
Metal detectors, phone losing reception
I should be grateful this my nine to five
I walk into the green room, alright, alright
I get on YouTube tryna learn how to tie on my tie
Fuck it, I'll wear the bolo tonight, night, night
I probably shouldn't have done the drugs I've done
A couple of days ago, detox son
I forgot my belt at the hotel
Fuck, now my team all scrambling to help, this sucks
I need something to cope, ain't nothing to cope
I eat a banana and I drink a cup of Throat Coat
I wish I had the homies with me here but nope
Most of the artists that I know don't get invited to this show
Because success to them determines our value
The make-up, the power, the hairspray, perfume, makeup and powder
The ratings come down to who's popular now in the song in the hour
Knock at the door, I let them in, hair and makeup now, red carpet in ten
She covers up my freckles, concealer on my chin
I look orange but she swears that it's natural with my skin
The show is starting, they take me to my seat
Walk in the arena, feel the ego of elites
Like the whole industry is staring at me
A row away from Taylor, two away from Jay and Bey

[Hook: Mike Slap]
Last night the skies turned purple and
Past lives in light tunnels
Light tunnels
So that's who we are
Just like the stars
Shine your light on
Shine your light on

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Curtain opens up, host walks out
We stand in unison and applaud real loud
I watch the other people that have been around for a while
Just excited I got invited, feeling cool in the crowd
Thinking such and such is bold, look at such and such's gold
Damn, such and such in real life, looks really fuckin' old
Such and such is fine, she's with such and such, oh
I'm here but I'm barely even watching the show
Cause tonight we toast to our accomplishments
Insecurity dressed up as confidence
I said tonight we toast to our accomplishments
Insecurity dressed up as confidence
An award is given out, commercial, reset the scene
They keep saying, "Coming up so
