Hey!

[Audience Applause]

[Intro]
Hey!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
People keep on talking
Bogeying around
Take you to me party
Sitting on the town
Yeah, hey

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I’ve gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body’s aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo.) Galileo. (Galileo.) Galileo. Galileo Figaro magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

[Guitar Solo 2]

Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah

[Outro: Freddie Mercury & (Audience)]
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
(Nothing really matters)
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows

[Intro]
Hammer to fall!

[Verse 1]
Here we stand or here we fall
History won't care at all
Make the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight

[Chorus]
You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
We are just waiting
For the hammer to fall

[Verse 2]
Oh every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the Western Way
Build your muscles as your body decays

[Chorus]
Tow the line and play their game
Let the anesthetic cover it all
Until one day they call your name
You know it's time for the hammer to fall

[Bridge]
Rich or poor or famous for
Your truth is all the same (oh no, oh no)
Lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane (oh no)
Baby now your struggle's all in vain

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the Mushroom Cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just want to scream it louder and louder

[Chorus]
What the hell are we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
You just got time to say your prayers
While you are waiting for the hammer to, hammer to fall

[Outro]
It's gonna fall
Hammer... You know... Hammer to fall
Waiting for the hammer to fall now, baby
While you're waiting for the hammer to fall

Give it to me one more time

[Intro]

[Chorus]
This thing called love, I just can't handle it
This thing called love, I must get ’round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love

[Verse 1]
This thing (This thing)
Called love (Called love)
It cries
In a cradle all night
It swings
It jives
It shakes all over like a jelly fish
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love

[Bridge]
There goes my baby
She knows how to rock 'n’ roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat
{Break}

[Verse 2]
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Verse 3]
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready (Ready Freddie!)
Crazy little thing called love

[Chorus]
This thing called love, I just can't handle it
This thing called love, I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Take it, take it

[Guitar Solo 2]

[Outro]
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, uh-huh
Crazy little thing called love, uh0huh
Crazy little thing called love, alright

[Audience Cheering]

[Spoken Word: Freddie Mercury]
Thank you, good night!

[Audience Clapping]
Ahhhhh
The minute you walked in the joint
I could see you were a woman of distinction
A real big spender
Good looking - so refined
Wouldn't you like to know what's going on in my mind?

Let me get right to the point
I don't pop my cork for every one I see
Hey, big spender!
Spend a little time with me ...

[Verse 1]
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made them laugh, you made them cry
You made us feel like we could fly (radio)
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

[Chorus]
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

[Verse 2]
We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

[Chorus]
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Someone still loves you!

[Bridge]
(Radio ga ga Radio ga ga)
(Radio ga ga Radio ga ga)
(Radio ga ga Radio ga ga)

[Outro]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

[Verse 1]
Another red letter day
So the pound has dropped and the children are creating
The other half ran away
Taking all the cash and leaving you with the lumber

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a pain in the chest
Doctors on strike what you need is a rest
It's so easy love, 'cause you've got friends you can trust

[Chorus]
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand, friends will be friends
Right till the end

[Verse 2]
Now it's a beautiful day
The postman delivered a letter from your lover
Only a phone call away
You tried to track him down but somebody stole his number

[Pre-Chorus]
As a matter of fact
You're getting used to life without him in your way
It's so easy now, 'cause you got friends you can trust

[Chorus]
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand, friends will be friends
Right till the end

[Verse 1]
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through
(And I need to go on and on, and on, and on)

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Verse 2]
I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose
(And I need just go on and on, and on, and on)

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Outro]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end, oh
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions...

...of the world

Or maybe I'm just old

Maximize all the pleasure
Maximize all the pleasure
Even with all this weather
Nothing can make it better

Makes it hard for me to hear what I'm thinking
Sometimes I don't understand what I say
So it's fine if you gotta get away

Maximize all the pleasure
Even with all this weather
Nothing can make it better
Maximize all the pleasure
Maximize all the pleasure
Even with all this weather
Nothing can make it better
Maximize all the pleasure

You are your own boss

Decide who goes first

James Murphy is spinning at my house, I met him at Coachella

Everything is fading, fading, fading

I'd go back on my word 'cause you know I need you, baby
I cried "Please, baby"
I fold and flee, baby
I know all that it takes to take you over, baby
I know all that it makes to see you glazed in sweat
I'll taste curse on your lips if you don't give into me, baby
Let me be the thing you won't regret
Let me be the thing you won't regret

[Chorus: ABRA]
'Cause if you miss me, baby
You're gonna miss me, yeah

Run away with me

The way you flip it back with the stares

I can't take the BART, makes me paranoid
So I take the car just to check my tunes

Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
What you mean you don't know?
For a second, I forgot who I was
For a minute, I was over you
For that year, I was looking down
Someone hold me down, down with the truth
Die for my love, die for my grind
50-50 fail, fuck it, I'ma die flying
Oh, satisfying, that's for the lying
That's for your crying, all of the lying

All the guys say, "She blows"
'Cause that's what makes her very special to me

But where is she now?
She's got one night on the town
When she comes to my house
I know I'ma nail her now

[Chorus]
You're a skank, you're a whore
You're a slut, but I like it, I like it
Everyone gets a turn like a door

You're a skank, you're a whore
You're a slut, but I like it, I like it

Everywhere she goes
She thinks that guys are wonderful

But where is she now?
She just left my best friend's house
I should kick her out
But she's so fucking awesome

[Verse 1]
In the desert, you came into my mind Mother Nature, you gave me a lifetime
I thought twenty-nine was an easy one to get through
Just to summarize, I don't think we're done with all the issues
I don't think it's me, I don't think it's you, It's the universe
I can feel a change coming over us and it's gonna hurt

Oh, my god, it took a while
Oh, my god, it took too long for me to find out if I really am for us or this

[Refrain]
I think you and I just weren't thinking right
It's so wild, everybody went and changed overnight

[Verse 2]
Left me all the pieces, she got me fallin' outta love
I been workin' weekends, I can't tell the difference if I'm up
I'm just a satellite, I been zoning out
This music's way too loud
There's only really one reason I know what to feel
Is that I know this weight is more than real
So we might as well be falling while holdin' on

[Verse 1]
I want to be like your last girl
She's got looks that drive you wild and
Love the way she wears her makeup
She would be so nice to wake up to
She’s so sweet
And she's so pretty
Even more than me

[Verse 2]
I want to be like your last girl
She's the sun in your cold world and
I am just a dying flower
I don’t hold the summer in my eyes
She's so cool
And the boys all drool
When she leaves with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I'm just feeling like
I don't have a chance this time
'Cause I don't have a chance this time, I swear

[Chorus]
Why would you still want to be with me?
She's got everything you'll ever need
Why would you still want to be with me?
She’s got everything

[Verse 3]
I want to be like your last girl
She’s got looks that hypnotize and
She could keep you occupied
I know she still hangs in your mind these days
She's so fine
And she’s always nice
Does it drive you wild?

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I'm just feeling like
I don't have a chance this time
'Cause I don’t have a chance this time, I swear

[Chorus]
Why would you still want to be with me?
She's got everything you'll ever need
Why would you still want to be with me?
She's got everything
Why would you still want to be with me?
She's got everything

[Verse 1]
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If'n you don't know by now
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It'll never do somehow
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I’ll be gone
You’re the reason that I’m traveling on
But, don’t think twice, that’s all right

[Verse 2]
Well, it ain't no use in turning off your light, babe
The one that I never knowed
Well, it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I’m on the dark side of the road
Well, I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway
But, don’t think twice, that’s all right

[Verse 3]
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe
Like you've never done before
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe
I can’t hear you anymore
Well, I’m thinking and wondering, walking down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I’m told
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
But, don’t think twice, that’s all right

[Verse 4]
Well, so long, honey babe
Where I’m bound, I cannot tell
Well, goodbye's too good a word, babe
So, I’ll just say fare thee well
Well, I'm not saying that you treated me unkind
You could have done better but, hey, I don’t mind
You just kind of wasted my precious time
But, don’t think twice, that’s all right

[Outro]
But, don't think twice, that's all right
Well, don't think twice, that's all right

[Verse 1]

[Verse 1]
Uh, too many handshakes given
Too many prayers for forgiveness
Too many smiles when you hurtin'
Too many thoughts on your mind
All the time, got you nervous
And you always read your horoscope
Tryna figure if the nigga that you talkin' to the one
And your friends say no, dealership say no
But fuck it you got a body that'll pay the car note
Thirty percent for the down payment
Pull out the lot girl now you famous
You on your own and your'e doin' just fine
Every check stub wanna buy you time

[Bridge 1]
It ain't hard when you feel it
Cause' when you feel it you kill it
Your pride gone now you willin'
Tell the world they in danger
Even tell a stranger

[Chorus 1]
You all for the feeling
You all for the feeling
Yes you all for the feeling
You all for the feeling
And you ain't never walked away from that feeling

[Verse 2]
Take a breath and say something
Go on ahead, talk about it
Money over discussion
Make a little something out of nothing
And all these promises, they all bluffing
Water the seed till the soils muddy
Uh, and every holiday you work
And when I have time you be at work
Damn, I guess you're looking for better
But I'm digging in that pussy like i'm lookin' for a treasure
And the feeling don't die if you don't let it, but you don't let it
That's why I give you credit, and today my lucky day
Today she doin' nothing, so when we get together
I put it in her stomach she say

[Bridge 2]
Tunechi I feel it
She feel it when I kill it
Her pride gone now she willing
Tell the world they in danger
Even tell a stranger

[Chorus 2]
That it's all for the feeling
Say it's all for the feeling
Yeah you all for the feeling
You all for the feeling
And you ain't never walked away from that feeling

[Verse 3]
Take a breath and say something
Go on ahead, talk about the weeks
Talk about the months, talk about the pussy niggas
Man they all punks, live for the moment
Life ain't fair, sorry for the feeling
No grey hair, you ain't worried about nothing
Turn nothing into something
And never let that go

[Bridge 3]
Tell the world they in danger
Even tell a stranger

[Chorus 3]
You all for the feeling
Yeah you all for the feeling
Yes you all for the feeling
God willing
You never walk away from that feeling
You all for the feeling
Yes you all for the feeling
Keep your head to the ceiling
Kill it when you feel it
Cause' you all for the feeling

[Outro]
Take a breath and say something
Girl lets talk about it
Mmm, yeah
But you ain't gotta say nothing
Because, your eyes say everything
They asked me why I did it
And I told em' it was all for the feeling

[Intro: Lil Wayne & SVW]
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak
Turn the music up a little bit in my headphones, please

Yeah, that's more like it, uh

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Ooh girl, you got me so weak
Ooh girl, your body unique, Amen, yes Lord
You an amazing lil broad
When you pass out wave and applaud, baby on call
Late at night spent on a beach
Hold hands and gaze at the stars, I play the guitar
When we fuck it's crazy, bizarre
She say I'm raising the bar
Her legs is ajar, her hair is a mess
She raising her arms, I stare at her breast, then I caress
And now she impressed, she say I'm the best, and I say I guess, and now she obsessed
And now she just text, with a request, to come be my guest, I said be my guest, have her W-E-A-K F-O-R W-E-E-K-S, I'm serious
I eat that pussy 'til she delirious, then she blow me like helium
Her tongue long, reptilian
Make love long, resilient, and then we spoon like cereal
And I came like four or five times, she just swallowed whole familia, and now I'm weak

[Chorus: SVW & Lil Wayne]
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak
(Yeah)
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Girl, where you going and where you coming from?
I could take you where you never been before
I make them hoes go back in they Pigeonhole
And turn the stress that you under into mistletoes
Girl you just perfect
And then we make a video, we sixty-nine on purpose
I mean it is what it is, and you get what you give, man
Don't you love reimbursements?
Girl it's just perfect
She dream about how good the dick is, and it's better in person
She said, it make her a better person
Even better, it make her a wetter person, rainy weather
I come first, she come last, and we came together
She said "ooh" I said "yes" like we sang together
Fuck her slow, fuck her fast, then I keep it mellow
She suck it slow, suck it fast, squeeze her cheeks together
Ooh, girl that got me so weak
Ooh, girl your body on fleek
I swear to god, your body should be illegal, and I'll catch the charge, hold up as I press record
I'm extra hard, you don't need no extra toys
It's Tunechi, bitch I'm freakazoid
That pussy I will destroy if it's hot pink and warm
I swear, I pinky swore, baby

I swear, I pinky swore, baby

Now you weak in the knees, you can't even feel them
W-E-A-K

[Outro: SVW]
I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes over me
(Mula)
In a daze and it's so amazing, it's not a phase
I want you to stay with me, by my side
I swallow my pride, your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak

[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
Unh, we don't even talk no more
We ran outta' words to say, yeah
We don't even joke no more
We ran outta' games to play, um

[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]
Now I know that you ain't used to
Hearin' me at a tempo as slow as this
But I just had to slow it down
So you can hear me when I say
I need you, I need you
I'm nothing without you a zero without you, baby
I need you, I need you
I'm nothing without you, that's why I'm glad I got you, baby

[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]
We don't even laugh no more
What was funny yesterday isn't funny today, Lord
We don't make love no more
And when we do it's not the same man, Umm

[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]
And I know that you ain't used to
Hearin' me at a tempo as slow as this
But I just had to slow it down
So you can hear me when I say
I need you
I'm nothing without you a zero without you, Baby
I need you
I'm nothing without you, So glad I got you, Baby

[Outro: Lil' Wayne]
Yeah, I know it is...
I must be doing something right, I must be doing some...
I must be doing something right
And I'mma keep doing it right
I said I'mma keep doing it right, Uh, Oh

[Intro]
Velvet, velvet, velvet, velvet, velvet, velvet

[Verse 1]
She 5'5, with brown eyes, and she kinda shy, she be tryna hide
But she tryna vibe, but the bottom line is she got a guy, but she compromise, woah
He must be out his mind, or can't find the time, until she out of time, and now he out of town
He always out of town, he say he on the grind, he say she on his mind, she say you "always lying"
He say "Baby don't you see I'm out here on the rise?"
She say "Boy you need to get that shit organised"
But he was working hard on Tha Carter V
He was working hard on Tha Carter V
And a hard working man like me is so hard to find
But now she wanna leave in my darkest times
And now I'm like..

[Chorus]
Where my old lady? Imma kill that bitch
Where my old lady? I'mma kill that bitch
I'm like
Where my old lady? Imma kill that bitch?
When I find that bitch Imma kill that bitch
I'm like
Where my old lady at? (Where my old lady?)
Where my old lady at? (Where my old lady?)
And when you see that bitch you better tell that bitch
That when I find that bitch Imma kill that bitch

[Verse 2]
She 5'5, with brown eyes, and she kinda shy, but she qualify
And she modify, and she promised that she ride or die
She kinda lied, left a nigga traumatized
Dramatize, I had to put my pride aside
I've gotten wise, I had to seek with widened eyes
Realize, recognize and strategize
Christian Mingle, E-Harmony, I harmonize
I can buy the world but I can't buy time
You Don't Have To Be lonely, Farmersonly.com
I'm 5'5, with sad eyes
Got my mama's views, with my dad's eyes
Got bad eyes
Cause real love is, what I can't find in the day time with a flashlight
Now where you at hoe?
Where you at hoe?
Got me like..

[Chorus]
Where my old lady? Imma kill that bitch
Where my old lady? I'mma kill that bitch
I'm like
Where my old lady? Imma kill that bitch?
When I find that bitch Imma kill that bitch
I'm like
Where my old lady yeah? (Where my old lady?)
Where my old lady yeah? (Where my old lady?)
And when you see that bitch you better tell that bitch
That when I find that bitch Imma kill that bitch

[Verse 3]
If you're out there in the streets and you're looking for me
Yeah, If you're out there in the streets and you're looking for me
Yeah, If you're out there in the streets and you're looking for me
I'll be out there on the creep looking for wifey
Going Sherlock Holmes, Inspector Gadget
Bitches burn Bridges, get stuck in traffic
And pimpin' ain't easy but it gotta be done
I know pimpin' ain't easy but it's necessary
It's bigger than me; it's hereditary
So don't blame me for stunting like my daddy
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
And every hoe I done fucked done sucked my dick
Ooh, iPhone give up your location
And iCloud fucked up all your information
Heard you and that nigga on vacation
Damn, I heard you and that nigga on vacation
I'm making reservations
Got my swimming trunks like..

[Chorus]
Where my old lady? Imma kill that bitch
Where my old lady? I'mma kill that bitch
I'm like
Where my old lady? Imma kill that bitch?
When I find that bitch Imma kill that bitch
I'm like
Where my old lady at? (Where my old lady?)
Where my old lady at? (Where my old lady?)
And when you see that bitch you better tell that bitch
That when I find that bitch Imma kill that bitch

[Verse 4]
When I find that bitch, Imma kill that bitch
When I find that bitch, Imma kill that bitch
Yeah, watch them hoes when you sleeping
Cause them dog ass hoes be creeping
You gotta watch them watch them watch-watch them bitches
Watch them watch them watch-watch them bitches
Gotta watch them hoes when sleeping
Cause them dog ass hoes be creeping
She 5'5, with brown eyes, and she kinda shy, but she qualified
And she tryna vibe, but the bottom line, is she gotta guy, she unsatisfied
Then she try to hide, hide behind my lies, after I apologized like a thousand times
She ask me to find the time like a thousand times
As soon as I find the time she say "Never mind"
When I try to revitalize, she too occupied
Don't I treat you like Concubine when you and I combine?
Don't I dick you down and make you holla like a soccer mom?
Don't I give you peace of mind, wa alaykum salaam
When I met you 'fore I fucked you, didn't I take my time?
I'll waste a drink on you before I waste your time
Kill the pussy, never flee the scene or the crime
But he was working hard, he was working hard on Tha Carter V

[Intro]
Eardrummers!
You outchea fuckin' for a check

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl you know my love on autopilot

And you say "Why you actin' funny with all of that money?"
I say "Why you actin' bad with all of that ass?"
She say "Why you actin' funny with all of that money?"

I'm outchea juugin' for a check, I'm on a night train
I'm zoomin in the fast lane, he in the bike lane

[Verse 1]
Bum bum, these niggas they so whomp whomp
Watchin' me and all they missin' is some pom poms
I got her pussy, numb numb, she say "uh huh"
Cellulite all on that ass, I call it lump sumps
But baby girl, tell me why you actin' funny
Every time I come around, you gotta ask me for money
See really, trickin' off ain't my thing
But I might give you somethin' if you change the game
Now, the only money I probably spend
Is on holidays, like Holiday Inn
And girl I can see it all over your face
That make up ain't making up for the mistakes
You know one thing, you ain't gettin' no money
You stump with your friends and all of them wan' fuck me
You actin' bad, you know I don't get mad
'Cause you know that I don't get mad, I get money
I know these hoes don't get mad, they get even
You know I can't get too mad, I'm too money
Plus I know there's too many dyin' to meet me
Plus the way I put this D down
You hoes should be paying me now
But I'm priceless
Preach

[Chorus 2]
She say "Why you actin' funny with all of that money?"
Why you actin' bad with all of that ass?
Why you actin' bad with all of that ass?
I give your ass a bath with all of this cash
'Cause I know you do some strange for a little change
You outchea fuckin' for a check, he need your real name
Million dollar man, million dollar flexin'
Million dollar question, million dollar question

[Bridge]
"Why you actin' funny with all that money?"
I say "Why you actin' bad with all that ass?"

[Verse 2]
She say "Why you actin' funny with all that money?"
I say "Why you actin' bad with all that ass?"
She say "Why you actin' funny?" - "Why you actin' funny?"
Girl why you actin' bad? All that for nothin'
See I gave you my love. Was all that for nothin'?
She say "Y'all the same. Y'all after somethin'."
Wait, baby hold up, baby wait a minute
Don't confuse me with these niggas, I done got offended
Don't confuse me with these niggas, I done got offended
I let you keep the receipt for all that time I'm spendin', shit

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl you know my love on autopilot
I tell you I love you, you get quiet
I tell you about you, you deny it
You tell me to buy it, I get quiet

[Chorus 3]
'Cause I know you do some strange for a little change

Million dollar question

[Intro]
Chef prepared dinner eating ass nigga

[Verse 1]

[Verse 2]
Lord I done went blind on they ass
Her fingers in my hair, and you know mine in her pants
She sit me in the chair and then she tie up my hands
She get on her hands standing, put her legs on my shoulders

So when he wanna fuck she be too tired for his ass
She used to think the stuff that she can buy for his ass
Now all she think about is stuff that I can try with that ass
And now all of a sudden he wanna play husband
He wanna lay cuddlin, He wanna make up and

[Verse 3]

Girl come your fine ass here I get behind all that ass
And grind on that ass
You tired of his ass and you tired of his lies
Time to spread your wings, open wide butterfly
Time to do your thing, rub your eyes butterfly
He was nothing but a fling, just some fries on the side
I know nothing's what it seems, and you tried many times
Got the man of your dreams, then surprise "rise and shine" (Lord)
So now it’s time (time, girl)
It's time for you to go off and do your thing, your own thing
And you should change your line
And before you leave give him back that small ring
It don't bling

[Bridge]
Now all of a sudden he wanna play husband
He wanna lay cuddlin
He wanna make up and
He wanna straighten up and
It been too late for it
I renovate for him
And then we say fuck him
Cause he ain't bout shit (Cause he ain’t bout shit)
Let him know I got this
Now when he call, her phone say "Side Bitch"
Tell him I say Got em
Tell him I say Got em, I got em, I got em, I got you, I got you
I got you, girl I got you
She's gone

[Outro]
And you ain't gotta worry cause I got you (she's gone)
And you ain't gotta worry cause I got you (she's gone)
Fuck him, I got you, you got me, Got em

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Now a Queen, once a Princess
Let's make a Princess
And you know time is money, time to invest
Talkin’ shit to her, without bad breath
Told her "I could take you there without MapQuest"
Thinking "Should I fall back, or forward progress?"
You know love is hard to swallow, and digest
Pause
She gon' have to take my love from me
But if I fall for her, you could call me clumsy
If I hit it and crash, I'm a crash dummy
I might just eat her up, I got an empty stomach
And you know drinking is bad, on an empty stomach
So we both get drunk, and just eat each other
We in the bedroom, I guess it’s one of those
I think you overdressed, in your underclothes
I confess to you, give my best to you
I told my last name, I'm tryna give an S to you
I think you a beast, without a leash
You could ride me, baby, like I'm the streets
I got a black eye, from your heartbeat
Make me change my lifestyle, call Robin Leach
I'm ready

[Chorus: Tevin Campell "I'm Ready" Sample]
I'm ready, (you know I'm ready)
To love you (to love you)
Forever (forever)
Hey love now
Come and love me forever more

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, we just thuggin, illin'
Puffin, chillin' on some shit that make us touch the ceilin’
If it’s just a feel feelin, what a feelin'
We invest in power, we progress like flowers
We’re in love, now we need something else to conquer
We go Casablanca, I'm your vagina monster
You know I get in that pussy and go Waka Flocka
Sexual healing, you know I'm your doctor
I'm a kill it, and I hit you with that Johnny Cochran
I’m the hottest topic, when you and your girlfriend talkin'
Tell her how I knock it, until we exhausted
You give me sloppy toppy, I eat it till I'm nauseous
I beat it like percussion, the neighbors think we arguing
Cupid hit the target, we use the whole apartment
They knockin' at the door, and she answer that bitch naked
She make me get an erection in a split second
She do tricks with her tongue, they so impressive
Am I trickin' too? um, that's a trick question
She asked me am I finna cum, that's a dick question
And she ain't fuckin' with you bums, give her indigestion
Can't you tell I've been ready?
Holla at her, Tevin

[Chorus: Tevin Campell "I'm Ready" Sample]
I'm ready, (you know I'm ready)
To love you (to love you)
Forever (forever)
Hey love now
Come and love me forever more

[Intro]
Who? Nigga who? Who?
(I took the jet to Dubai)
(I took the jet to Milan)
Who? Nigga who?

[Pre verse 1]
I pop a xan and chill
I buy some land and chill
I pour up the deuce, promethazine juice
And sip it like chamomile
I got that whip appeal
No I got that dick appeal
My bitch ain't Brazilian
But I could bet she look way better than Miss Brazil

[Verse 1]
I took the jet to Dubai
I took the jet to Milan
I took the jet way to Africa
Shout out my nigga Akon
Oh yes, the bitches was on me
Yeah, they be respecting my mind, shit

I got a check for my time
I David Beckham with dimes
That mean I kick it with bad ones
They put cocaine on they arm
And then they snort it when they dabbin
Hoody lying, bout he fasting
These hoes lying 'bout they juicin'
These niggas lying 'bout they stacks
Producers lying 'bout producin'

[Pre verse 2]
These artists lying 'bout they music
Me, I'm still the best rapper
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
I hope a bitch nigga try
I know these bitch niggas spyin'
I put that dick in her spine
I fuck that bitch in her prime

[Verse 2]
I know these bitches is dyin'
Just to be a rich nigga bride
But I tell her I'm not the one
Not the two, nor the three, four or five
I'm 'bout to eat me a juug
I'm 'bout to twist me some good
I'm in here sippin', I'm good
If it ain't Actavis then its uhhh
And my bitch got them lips and they full
And my goons got them clips and they full
And you know 'bout them triggers they pull
Yeah, you know 'bout my niggas. They wolves!
Animal kingdom, I bring them
Don't want my kingpin, I sling em
The eyes don't lie 'till you blink 'em
The iron on my side for the wrinkles
I'm high in the sky and I twinkle
The trap house came with the sprinklers
All of my homies delinquents
You ain't the plug, then you link us

[Chorus 1]
And I don't need Baby for help (Who?)
I don't need Baby for help (Nigga who?)
I don't need Baby for help (Who?)
It's every man for themself, oh Lord
I don't need Baby for help (Who?)
I don't need Baby for help (Nigga who?)
I want Arabian wealth
And I don't need Baby for help, oh Lord

[Pre verse 3]
I could care less 'bout your squad
I throw my set at your squad
I feel the best when I'm high
But these niggas; they blowin my high
I throw a check in the sky
Tell these hoes to get naked and vibe
Your hoe; she sweatin' my squad
Please get the sweat out her eye

[Verse 3]
I'm on a jet so I'm fine
I don't connect when I'm flyin'
Don't get my credit declined
Give all the credit to moms!
Don't get my niggas upset
Don't get ahead of yourself
Cause we cut the head off your neck
And put that bitch on the shelf like a elk ugh
The sheets on my bed are by Ralph
I hate having a bed to myself
And I play em the way they was dealt
I see you drinking that Hatorade, belch
You pussies should play with yourself
You snakes come make me a belt
I want Arabian wealth
And I don't need Baby for help (no)
I don't need Baby for help (no)
I don't need Baby for help (no)
I don't need Baby for help
It's every man for themself Oh Lord
Them niggas playing themselves

I just be paying them bills
I'm just a man forreal Oh Lord
And I don't need Baby for help (Who?)
I-I-I don't need Baby for help (Nigga who?)
I don't need Baby for help (Who?)
It's every man for themself Oh Lord
I don't need Baby for help (Who?)
I-I-I don't need Baby for help (Nigga who?)
I want Arabian Wealth
And I don't need Baby for help Oh Lord

[Pre verse 4]
I could care less 'bout your squad
I could care less 'bout your squad
I could care less 'bout your squad
I could care less 'bout your squad
I could care less 'bout your side
I could care less if you ride
I could care less if you die

[Verse 4]
I took the jet to Dubai
I took the jet to Milan
I took the jet to South Africa
Oh yes the weather was fine
Oh yes, the bitches was on me
Yeah, they be respecting my mind, shit
I had a heck of a time
I got a check for my time
I David Beckham with dimes
That mean I kick it with bad ones
They put cocaine on they arm
And then they snort it when they dabbin
Hoody lying, bout he fasting
These hoes lying 'bout they juicin'
These niggas lying 'bout they status
Producers lying 'bout producin'

And I ain't have to say shit else after that
Gone

[Outro]

I could care less 'bout your squad (Nigga who?)
I could care less 'bout your side (who?)
Squad

[Verse 1]
I guess I just feel like
I guess I just feel like
Nobody's honest, nobody's true
Everyone's lyin' to make it on through
I guess I just feel like I'm the same way too

[Interlude]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
I guess I just feel like good things are gone
And the weight of my worries is too much to take on
I think I remember the dream that I had
That love's gonna save us from a world that's gone mad
I guess I just feel like
What happened to that?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I guess I just feel like the joke's gettin' old
And the future is fading and the past is on hold
But I know that I'm open and I know that I'm free
And I'll always let hope in wherever I'll be
And if I go blind, I'd still find my way
I guess I just felt like givin' up today

[Outro]
Mmm, yeah, yeah

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh
Hmm, mmm

[Verse 1]
Only love could bring us
Bring us to this bitter plane
Only one of us
Who's gonna walk away
Here in the deep below
That only darkness really knows
I'm hoping for a humble seed to grow
No, I won't surrender to this hard hearted night
Though I know the sun's gonna bring the palest of light
And all that remains is everything has gone
This life is mine so I'll carry on

[Chorus]
I'm just trying to hold on
I'm falling in the dark below
I feel I'm falling in the big unknown
Here in the deep below
I will rise
I will rise again
A humble seed will grow

[Verse 2]
I have to go back
To pull me from the wreck
I know it's not over yet
There's no fire and no flame
On this cold, cold plane
No way to measure my pain

[Chorus]
I'm just trying to hold on
I'm falling in the dark below
I feel I'm falling in the big unknown
I will rise
I will rise
I will rise again
A humble seed will grow

[Verse 1]
I love girls, that will never run away with me
Girls, they wouldn't spend a day with me
Oh, you could say that, you could say that
I’m hopeless, I'm hopeless
I love girls that will never end up with me
Girls, the ones I only see in my dreams
So, you could say that, you could say that
I love her, ooh, ooh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Make this the night of your life, life, life
You can dance if you want, make it feel alright
Oh, temperature's rising, you feel the fire
Let’s make a toast and celebrate
To all my ladies in here (Ow!)
This is dedicated to you (Ow! Ow!)
Girl, today is your day
This all about you (Ow!)
And baby, tonight you're all mine

[Bridge]
I think about her in the morning when I wake up
Never wears make-up, she don't need to fake that
She be on me, I be on her like a first date
Every single hour, wanna treat her like her birthday

[Chorus]
Every single hour wanna treat her like her birthday
Every single hour wanna treat her like her birthday
Yeah, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Birthday girl, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Birthday girl, birthday girl, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Got a girl, now she wanna do a date with me
So this must be my prophecy, yeah
You could say that, you could say that
I know this, one two, three, oh!

[Pre-Chorus]
Make this the night of your life, life, life
You can dance if you want, make it feel alright
Oh, temperature's rising, you feel the fire
Let's make a toast and celebrate
To all my ladies in here
This is dedicated to you
Girl, today is your day (Ow!)
This all about you (Ow!)
And baby, tonight you're all mine

[Bridge]
I think about her in the morning when I wake up
Never wears make-up, she don't need to fake that
She be on me, I be on her like a first date
Every single hour, wanna treat her like her birthday

[Chorus]
Every single hour wanna treat her like her birthday
Every single hour wanna treat her like her birthday
Yeah, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  (I love my birthday girl)
Birthday girl, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (I love, l-l-l-love)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Prince Royce]
Yo sé que te gusta, mamacita
Como te doy lo que tú necesitas
Te prendo y hago que tú te derritas
Me aruñas and I'm gettin' deep and deeper, yeah
Como lo hacíamos antes, como amigos, como amantes
Tan complicado y sencillo (oh you like that)

It's what ever whenever, whatever with whoever, I'm ready with Betty, with Jenny, with Lany, with Bonnie, with Cami, with Yami
Your sister, your mami, your aunty
She want it, I'm with it
Don't stop get it-get it work that pretty kitty
You need it? I got it, believe me I'm bodied
Now roll it and light it, bone it, and ride it
El loquito Armandito te da un besito en tu ombliguito
Te saca el mojito, te vuelvo loquita and I'm gone
Estos muchachitos hablan mucho y no hacen na'
Ponle taquito en los huevitos, dale mami más
Yo soy hombre hecho, y derecho, animal
Lucadris, Armando Bond, Prince Royce sing this song

[Verso 3: Ludacris]
Luda! Listen
I'm back and I'm better
They want me more now than ever
I told them I came to save the—day
In fact, I'm a rebel I still got all of this cheddar
And women, know that the boys don't—play
Love it how I position your silly putty arms
Your legs will turn into twizzlers
Kissin' your body soft
From your toes, to your forehead
May just come up missin'
Police will be sending code reds
Its an emergency, loving you is in an urgency
Purposely call me nutty professor stronger than Hercules
Dama, amor, can you be my señorita?
You speak Spanish? I say Sí, mamacita!

[Estribillo: Prince Royce]
Quiero saber (Quiero Saber)
Cuándo te volveré a ver (I wanna know)
Quiero saber (Oooooh!)

[Intro]
This lady is giving head
On I-95, at the toll

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
I ever tell you 'bout the time I, drivin' down the I-9?
Lady in the passenger, smokin' on la-la
Put your blunt up in the ash tray
And get your hair up out the way
Just keep your head low
Just keep your head low
Me and little Joonie sittin' in a movie
Soon as the lights out, she gon' pull the pipe out
She don't want no popcorn, she just want her mouth on me
Just keep your head low
Just keep your head low

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & Norelle]
Ooh, she pulls my coat and so I have to slow it down, do it simple
She says pull over, uh oh, I slow it down, do it simple
My windows foggin' up, I see them watchin' us
We're almost home, better keep your head low
Better keep your head low

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
I ever tell you 'bout the time when I, runnin' down the 9 mile?
Lady with the Puma sneaks
Sit up on me, head towel
Grippin' locks with the right palm
Hey, don't stop, baby, keep goin'
Just keep your head low
Just keep your head low
Tears fallin' down my left cheek
Baby hit the nerve like a Pepsi
You can't breathe when I'm neck deep
I take it out but you just wanna finish me
Everywhere we go, we make a scene
We hit it long as long as you can keep
Just keep your head low
Just keep your head low

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & Norelle]
Ooh, she pulls my coat and so I have to slow it down, do it simple
She says pull over, uh oh, I slow it down, do it simple
My windows foggin' up, I see them watchin' us
We're almost home, better keep your head low
Better keep your head low

[Outro: Norelle & Anderson .Paak]
She pulls my coat and so I have to slow it down, do it simple
She says pull over, uh oh, I slow it down, do it simple
My windows foggin' up, I see them watchin' us
We're almost home

[Skit: Anderson .Paak & (Norelle)]
Oh fuck
Oh, oh, keep goin', keep goin', keep goin', keep goin'
Keep doin' that, keep doing that
Who the fuck taught you how to do that shit? Aw, fuck
Oh shit
(Oh my god, holy shit)
Just keep goin', I'm almost there
I'm almost there, I'm almost there, I'm almost there
Just go around me, go around me, I'm almost there
Move, nigga

[Intro: Kadhja Bonet]
Evacuations are now-Anderson .Paak va a estar tocando música en Oxnard
I need you more than you could know
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Ahh)
Don't let me down and don't let go (Ahh)

[Verse: Anderson .Paak]
Yeah, yeah, I say
You know I hit it almost every time and then I miss one
How we gon' get ourselves up outta this one?
Hard to get up from this like Sonny Liston
Feel like Isaiah and Laimbeer with the Pistons
Bad Boys, but no Will Smith and only real friction
Got to the fork in the road, a split decision
I could eat or split everything, my own decisions
That would take a little more time and more wisdom
That would take a little more grind and more vision
What's the difference between the poor and the rich man?
Standing in line or having wristbands
These are lessons you learn with no tuition

[Break: Anderson .Paak]
Hold on and ride for your own
Together in spirit form
With your hands I can hold
In your heart there is hope

[Outro: Anderson .Paak]
Time has no weight without heads to implant
Who we are, who we see, so much clearer now
It may not be in their sights but that don't take us out of clear view
Hold on, hold tight, hold tight
Hold on, if not for you then I
Hold on and ride for your own
Together in spirit form

[Intro: Anderson .Paak & Dr. Dre]
They want my bidness on the front page (Headlines)
I put prescription in Dior frames (Sunshine)
I had the vision back in 12th grade (Lunchtime)
That I'd be killing shit with Doc Dre (Nigga, what?)

[Pre-Chorus]
I never want it to ever be over (Over)
I'm out in Philly, I thought it'd be colder (Colder)
Drunk off the liqui, I might need a chauffeur (Chauffeur)
Check out my jiggy, check out my, uh

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & Dr. Dre]
Now, who are you? (Man, who the fuck is this?)
I don't know, no
What you do? (Hmm, what?)
I don't know, no
You short a few? (Oh, don't make me have to lose it)
Oh no, no, hold up
Pull my sticky out the jar, come on

[Verse 1]
Ooh savage, that's a nice get-up
International, rocking Japanese denim
Enough gas to get you above average
How many more drags do I have to puff from my cigar?
New enemies, they bringing my old ways back
Back in my day, woulda had your whole face smacked
Look at you niggas, wonder why I fucking hate rap
Ooh, what make you wanna go and say that? (You)
And I'm on another wave, and I'm puttin' on suede
Niggas feeling overpaid, fuck I'm 'posed to do? (Do)
Don't nobody know your name, we ain't ever seen ya face
You ain't ever gang-bang, what you tryna prove?

[Pre-Chorus]
I never want it to ever be over (Over)
I'm out in Philly, I thought it'd be colder (Colder)
Drunk off the liqui, I might need a chauffeur (Chauffeur)
Check out my jiggy, check out my, uh

[Chorus]
Now, who are you? (Ooh, nigga)
I don't know, no
What you do? (Ooh, nigga)
I don't know, no
You short a few? (Ooh, nigga)
Oh no, no, hold up
Pull my sticky out the jar, come on

[Verse 2]
I've been swimming through the process
And you can't see me, I'm the Loch Ness
You could proceed, but with caution
Give the proceeds to my god-kids
Old dirt on my conscience
Same nigga my pop is
Lame niggas wanna pop shit
Get dropped quick by a drop kick
Why you gotta lie to me so much, babe?
You tell me the same shit that you told what's-his-name
If it don't work out, I'll go back to hustling
Couple hundred-thousand up in my mother's name, peace
World peace, niggas talk about "Don't shoot"
Tell that to police, mmm
Scared, ain't none of them prepared, I could see
Promise I'ma get them commas before I decease

[Pre-Chorus]
I never want it to ever be over (Over)
I'm out in Philly, I thought it'd be colder (Colder)
Drunk off the liqui, I might need a chauffeur (Chauffeur)
Check out my jiggy, check out my, uh

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & Dr. Dre]
Now, who are you? (Man, who the fuck is this?)
I don't know, no
What you do? (Ooh, nigga)
I don't know, no
You short a few? (Ooh, nigga)
Oh no, no, hold up
Pull my sticky out the jar, come on
Now, who are you? (Whoa, nigga)
I don't know, no
What you do? (Whoa, nigga)
I don't know, no
You short a few? (Whoa, nigga)
Oh no, no

[Outro: Dr. Dre]
Hey, AP, let it ride out

[Intro]
Wait a minute!

Trump's got a love child and I hope that bitch is buckwild
I hope she sip mezcal, I hope she kiss señoritas and black gals
I hope her momma’s El Salv', I hope her poppa stick around, yeah

[Verse 1]
Take chains off, take rings off
Bracelets and things, big aches and pains
My jack rang off with clickbait
Truth is too raw, it's a fish plate
Fela, the kunte
A hunnid and fifty of us on the big stage?
How long it took a nigga just to get paid?
And now I think I’m 'bout to buy a Bentley, pronto
I'm in LA with the shaker and bongo
I heard your tape, do or die, it was compo-
Trimmin' the bream with the blade and lawnmow'
Figure it out, nigga
Bitch, don't spill my sake
You gon' make me kick you out this 'partment
You gon’ have to kick it in the lobby
Damn, but don’t somebody stop me, I'm too sloppy

[Break]
Trump’s got a love child and I hope that bitch is buckwild
I hope she sip mezcal, I hope she kiss señoritas and black gals
I hope her momma's El Salv', I hope her poppa stick around
Yes, Lord

[Interlude]
The revolution will not be televised
But it will be streamed live
In 1080p on your pea-brain head in the face ass mobile device
Alright?

[Break]
This shit gon' bang at least six summers
From out that rock you been under
Mummy wrapped, duffel bag, gutter bunny
It’s hard to stomach cold murder
It's easier to get a nine millimeter
He was nineteen with a burner, they had to off 'em (Off 'em)
Reform, reform shoulda came sooner (Sooner)

[Chorus]
Wait a minute!
This shit gon' bang at least six summers
(Summers, summers, summers, summers
Summers, summers, summers)
Word!
This shit gon' bang for at least six summers
But ain't shit gon' change for at least three summers
They tryna kill a nigga faith, we need a little truth, brother
Pop-pop-pop goes the shooter
Reform, reform shoulda came sooner

[Verse 2]
Come on
This shit gon' bang at least six summers
Pop the top, that bitch hot than a motha
We need more peace and less lone gunners
Put down your heat and smoke marijuanas
Pop the lock off your muzzle
Niggas is dyin' like lost files in the shuffle
We know you lyin', my nigga, naw, we don't trust you
We know you buy to sell it back to the public
'Cause there's money to be made in a killin' spree
That's why he tryna start a war on the Twitter feed
Somebody take this nigga's phone, is you kiddin' me?
And take them AK's up outta these inner city streets

[Chorus]
This shit gon' bang for at least six summers
But ain't shit gon' change for at least three summers
They tryna kill a nigga faith, we need a little truth, brother
Pop-pop-pop goes the shooter
Reform, reform shoulda came sooner

[Break]
And so I smoke, drink, just to cope with the pain
Get the Coltrane and the Cobain
And so I smoke, drink, just to cope with the pain
Get the Coltrane and the Cobain

[Verse 3]
Dear Mr. President, it's evident that you don't give a damn
Shi-tell me somethin' that I don't know
All this fuckin' evidence and if it ever make it to the stand
Shi-you know they gon' let 'em go, bro
You was overseas stealin' niggas' land and oil
Billy copped the Desert Eag' and it's legal to tote it
Lil' nigga bullied out his Pumas
But why he have to shoot the whole school up?

[Break]
And so I smoke, drink, just to cope with the pain
Get the Coltrane and the Cobain
And so I smoke, drink, just to cope with the pain
Get the Coltrane and the Cobain

[Chorus]
This shit gon' bang at least six summers
(Summers, summers, summers, summers, summers, summers, summers)
Word!
This shit gon' bang for at least six summers
But ain't shit gon' change for at least three summers
They tryna kill a nigga faith, we need a little truth, brother
Pop-pop-pop goes the shooter
Reform, reform shoulda came sooner

[Intro]
Here I go again

[Chorus]
There I go fallin' to me knees right now
Tryna get it back on my feet right now
Choppin’ up the weight I don't need
Maybe I could sell it to a fiend, right now
Ay, what'chu need?
An ounce, a quarter, a P
I would sell you faith but you niggas don’t believe

[Break]
Lord, forgive them for they do not know what they do
But God if you're listening
Yes, Lawd
I could still reach you

[Verse]
Ten P's in the rental truck
Trimmin' flowers in the Marriott with little cuz
Send 'em off to Arizona, let 'em build a buzz
Then get it back for triple the profit, help 'em split it up
Ten years, been a minute, I was somewhere between givin' up and doin’ a sentence
God, if you existin’, help my momma get acquitted
If they plottin', then help me see it before they get the drop on me
Probably coulda been a doctor, I’m fond of optometry
Vision was like Martin Luther on the mountain peak
Valley lows, I left home for more salary
Smuggled O's across border patrol, casually
Took notes and took control of it manually
Hand to hand 'til it's white sands in the canopy
Now follow me
I’m too old to act childishly
But every now and then I park the Beamer in the gallery
Show off the paint for spectators and the faculty
Same ol' niggas that said they proud of me
Same ol' niggas that probably doubted me
Who gon' work it out for me?

[Chorus]
There I go fallin' to me knees right now
Tryna get it back on my feet right now
Choppin' up the weight I don't need
Maybe I could sell it to a fiend, right now
Ay, what'chu need?
An ounce, a quarter, a P
I would sell you faith but you niggas don't believe

[Intro]
What is it about my smile that makes you lie to my face?
If I close my eyes to your bullshit, I could still smell it on you
I could smell it from a mile away
You can't be the truth and the lie
Oh no, hey
Make up your mind, baby
What is it about my smile that makes you lie to my face?

[Verse 1]
Let me ask this, just what does it take to be the apple of your iris?
How much of this bullshit until we reach the pasture?
Ain't no need to gas me, it was lit from the lashes
Back when chit-chattin' casually 'bout how you think monogamy is somethin' of the past
But, baby girl, your actions speak somethin' totally opposite
And you have to pardon me, 'cause I am a dog, you see
And if you lead me to the park, I break up off the leash
What is it about my smile that would make you ponder kickin' dirt in my water?
Spillin' bleach in the laundry bag and stressin' my momma
Pushin' dents in my armor, scratchin', dentin' my Pontiac
Bitch, are you off your shit?
I bag another one just to piss you off and shit
Don't make me put the shit I bought you up for auction, bitch

[Break]
Hold on, hold the fuck up
Pause this shit

[Verse 2]
My lady drives me high up the wall
She keeps me up and locked in the bathin' room
Why am I screamin' at the top of my lungs?
When she can't hear a word that I say to her?

[Chorus]
You petty, petty bitch, (Huh, petty)
Calculate (All of it)
Trackin' (All of it)
All of this (Bullshit)
Worthless shit, you packaged up
Tossed out my shit, (All of it, all of it, all)
Bitch, now you know that was totally out of pocket

[Break]
Would've let me fall off
(Would you catch me when I fall?)
I won't sweat the small stuff
(No more chasin' pennies, no)
I can't keep from fallin' off
Keep me from these useless bitches, these ruthless leeches
I might catch you all alone
(I don't need it, I don't need it)

[Verse 3]
Now bro, he lends me no help at all
He's out there chasin' money that's far too small
Lately, he's talkin' 'bout invest and withdraw
But the loan of which you owe me is far from paid off
Oh, Lord

[Chorus]
You petty, petty bitch, (Huh, petty)
Calculate (All of it)
Trackin' (All of it)
All of this (Bullshit)
Worthless shit, you packaged up
Tossed out my shit, (All of it, all of it, all)
Bitch, now you know that was totally out of pocket

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Back on my bullshit
I got some money to blow, I'm lookin' good, bitch
Even as the king, I stay hood rich
Mansa Musa, gold jewelry
Ooh, what'chu talkin' 'bout? Shit, gold toothpicks
Every day is Christmas, Santa got his roof missin'
All they do throw shots at the king, it's foolish
It's Mansa Musa, power, move, bitch!

[Verse 1: Cocoa Sarai]
Uh, my money, money, pocket so dummy
That mean my money so sick, I might just cough up a hunnid
Rich gyal in me own time zone, fuck whoever
Shit, you gotta love me
Now if you owe me mine, better run it
A hunnid miles and runnin', yeah, I'm comin', still gunnin'
Shit that we be on, you could hate it or love it
And if I said it, then I meant it, muh fucker, who want it?

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Now I've been on some different shit lately
Like I need to dumb it down for this hip hop scene
Like I only come around for this type shit here
If I have to bust around, it's on the hits, my dear
Now what we gwan do with all these hits over here?
Go up in smoke when I disappear, reappear
Hah, I'm just bein' sincere
Boss shit, how we do it? Crack music, top tier, nigga
Shut it down, my nigga, chill
We could see right through that bullshit
You pussy, nigga, we could tell
Better believe my product sell
Made a billion off my bullshit and did it, nigga, high as hell
Overachiever, nigga, I excel
If my name is on this muhfucker, better believe the stock's up
Professional winners around us
Gotta fly, leave the buildin', levitatin' on you motherfucks

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Back on my bullshit
I got some money to blow, I'm lookin' good, bitch
Even as the king, I stay hood rich
Mansa Musa, gold jewelry
Ooh, what'chu talkin' 'bout? Shit, gold toothpicks
Every day is Christmas, Santa got his roof missin'
All they do throw shots at the king, it's foolish
It's Mansa Musa, power, move, bitch!

[Verse 3: Anderson .Paak]
Mummy wrap, double back, gimmie that
Real rich niggas never advertise that
Broke niggas always playin' rich, puttin' on an act
Whoa, nigga, when your money grow, maybe we could chat
But in the meantime, I remain streamlined
Stackin' my ends if ever my money decline
I double my wins, now look how my whole team shine
Hell no, blow out my dough, I'm tryna keep mine
Nigga, fuck that snow up your nose, it's fuckin' ski time
Ho-ho, call up the hoes, it's shoppin' spree time
Don't nobody roll in a Rolls Royce where we from
So I'm goin' stupid as soon as I get a lil' sum
Dumb, they should have never gave you niggas money!
Hey, watch your mouth boy, you don't ball, boy
You don' maxin' out credit cards, boy
I'ma cash cow, you a hog wart
Tell you anything, you would fall for it
Get the piece, you don't really want war
Why the mean mug? That's uncalled for

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Now I'm back on my bullshit
I got some money to blow, I'm lookin' good, bitch
Even as the king, I stay hood rich
Mansa Musa, gold jewelry
Ooh, what'chu talkin' 'bout? Shit, gold toothpicks
Every day is Christmas, Santa got his roof missin'
All they do throw shots at the king, it's foolish
It's Mansa Musa, power, move, bitch!

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Yeah, nothing's safe when your numbers change
Keep it low or pay the fee
Niggas talking but it's not too often that they living what they speak
Good pussy kept me entertained
Money came then it went away
Lord see over everything (Over everything)
Am I my brother's keeper? (Am I my brother's keeper?)
You know everybody gotta eat, bruh
I wanna live on ahead, if not a cloud in the air
The right side of the chair
If Jesus would've had a better lawyer
Would he have to see the cross?
I hope your niggas is true, I hope they don't do you like Judas
I pray to God
Pain wearing off, sleeping while I talk
Laid in the arms, woke up at the top
I wanna live on ahead, if not a cloud in the air
Right side of the chair

[Pre-Verse: Pusha T & Anderson .Paak]
9 A.M. L.A. time
My brother just turned down a half a million dollars
For being one half of one of the greatest duos in hip-hop history
(Am I my brother's keeper?)
I couldn't love him more
(You know everybody gotta eat, bruh)
Everybody eats, B
(Am I my brother's keeper?)
King Push

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Am I my brother's keeper? They still asking 'bout the duo
Applaud his finding salvation
But I'm still rhyming 'bout the you know
It's hard to leave your foundation, this spaceship took me to Pluto
Still an underground king, but the money's Jason Derulo
Sumo in the safe, Cujo on the grill
Diamonds in the face, racing leather wheel
To all my other field niggas, you knowin' how I feel, niggas? (Woo)
Destroy and rebuild niggas
That's the only way to build nigga, yuugh
Definition of a real nigga
And the target, it ain't to kill niggas, no
Am I my brother's keeper? I'm dialing in a bit deeper
Arm's reach of the reaper, they say it's cheaper to keep her
Life's a bitch

[Outro: Anderson .Paak]
(How I ever, ever let you go)
(How I ever, ever let you go)
(How I ever, ever let you go)
(How I ever, ever let you go)
I'm running through changes, is it strange
(How I ever, ever let you go)
To be baited, shit I'm grown
(How I ever, ever let you go)
But still a fade
(How I ever, ever let you go)
Shootin' off with no marks
(How I ever, ever let you go)
If I hit, there's no mistakes, yeah
(How I ever, ever let you go)
Huh, baby
(How I ever, ever let you go)
I'm running through changes, daily
(How I ever, ever let you go)
Every day, ohh, ohh now
(How I ever, ever let you go)
I'm running through changes
(How I ever, ever let you go)
Through change
(How I ever, ever let you go)
Every day
(How I ever, ever let you go)
Will it stay
(How I ever, ever let you go)
I'm running through changes
(How I ever, ever let you go)
Will it change
(How I ever, ever let you go)

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Let me get that intro
Blunts, gators
Hand me my mink

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
On the East duckin' Feds from a peephole
1989, gangbangin' was at its peak
This the beat that make me reminisce on G-funk
Three summers before The Chronic hit the streets
I would rather slang hand to hand to a fiend
Rappin' on the side, trappin' was priority
But every now and then I go scoop my little thing
Pull up in my MC bangin' New Jack Swing
Ooh, summertime time back in Long Beach
Passin' one bottle, 40 oz. O.E
I didn't have a dollar but a nigga had a dream
Whippin' over the stove and a nigga gotta eat
Threw my raps in the garbage, fuck bein' a MC
Thank the Lord for Nate Dogg and thank God for Warren G
Funny how time flies when you're high as me

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
I think I'm in the Ruff Endz now
I seen her throwin' up H-Town
You was livin' off of Dru Hill
Wasn't ready for the world but baby, who is?
Know you prettier than all the El DeBarges
Never worry 'bout the total of the charges (I got this)

[Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
And if you need an escape for now, meet up at room 112
We do it anywhere (We can do it anywhere)
Ooh, yeah, and if you feenin'' (If you need a freak)
Just call me, baby (Call me)
I'll have you screamin' (Call me)
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus: The Last Artful, Dodgr & Anderson .Paak]
We'll get back to all that ghetto shit we like
But for now just let me hold you all night
Cheek to cheek just like they do in the movies
Tonight, baby, I want your love on time
As soon as I put this on
Cutie pie, you're the reason why
As soon as I put this on
I love ya so and I'll never let you go
As soon as I put this on, girl
Ooh, yeah
As soon as I put this on
Don't fight it, let it live

[Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
And if you need an escape for now, meet up at room 112
We do it anywhere (We can do it anywhere)
Ooh, yeah, and if you feenin' (If you need a freak)
Just call me, baby (Call me)
I'll have you screamin' (Call me)
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus: The Last Artful, Dodgr & Anderson .Paak]
We'll get back to all that ghetto shit we like
But for now just let me hold you all night
Cheek to cheek just like they do in the movies
Tonight, baby, I want your love on time
As soon as I put this on
Cutie pie, you're the reason why
As soon as I put this on
I love ya so and I'll never let you go
As soon as I put this on, girl
Ooh, yeah
As soon as I put this on

[Intro: Rodney Dangerfield & Johnny Carson]
Ah, that's right, doll
But everyone wants love
Love, is the answer, Johnny
Everyone is lookin' for love, deep love
A lifetime of deep love, you know?
I'm lookin' for a shallow half hour, you know?
Don't you have luck with women?
I never had luck with women
I'm no ladies man, I know that, Johnny
And I never got girls when I was a kid in show business either, you know?
One girl told me, "Come on over, there's nobody home"
I went over, there was nobody home!

[Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
You and I will always meet somewhere in between
You and I will always meet somewhere in between
Sweet Trippy, I'm yours for the gettin'
Talkin' foolish at the moon, I was gone, 1800, sippin'
I can't get rid of you, all the places that I used to go and kick it
All this weight that I'm liftin', trippy

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Come meet me in the middle, right there where you always be
Somewhere in between, you and I will always meet
Come meet me in the middle, right there where we always be
Somewhere in between, you and I will always meet
Come meet me in the middle (I'll meet you in the middle)
Come meet me in the middle (Somewhere in between)
Come meet me in the middle (You and I will always meet)
Right there where we always be (Somewhere in between)

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Without a space I could feel, in the words to define
Pick it up, if you will, heavy weight on my mind
Just a pretty brown thing wit'cho head in the clouds
Why don't you put the round thing in the palm of my hands
Up enough for the thrill, over over you spill
Open up, I could tell
I could see when it's real
And as soon as I grab a hold of ya, I'ma have to let go of ya

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Came down the block, somethin' sick, but it's rented
I don't give a fuck, bitch, either way, I'm in it
I ain't gotta prove to you that I got bread
Niggas talkin' money but be broker than the bed
That I slept on back in Mohammed crib
'Member fuckin' hoes leanin' all to the left?
Don't know why they rock wit' a nigga, but they did
Damn sure wasn't the money, maybe it's the kid?
Used to have a honey that I loved when we was younger but somehow got disconnected before Facebook got so big
I used to search her name hopin' we could reconnect
But if I sent the message, would she still be on my dick?
When I couldn't find her, had me feelin' mad lame
Maybe she got married and she changed her last name
Maybe she just ain't up on the latest of the internet and ain't got into that
But give her time, that'll change
Bingo, what do you know?
Years later (Right), late night after a show we here laid up (Right)
Brown skin, love how it glow, your hair tied up (Right)
Ask, "Is it cool if I smoke?" Go 'head, light up (Right)
High from your fragrance, I love, you smell purrty (Smells good)
Know I got it straight from the mud, my nails dirty (Right)
If somehow we both lose touch, I won't lie, ya got me open way too much, I'm gon' find ya

[Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Sweet trippy, you’re lost in the deep end, like water to a fish scale
Love to watch you swim
I can't get rid of you, all the places that I used to go and kick it
All this weight that I'm liftin', trippy

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Come meet me in the middle, right there where you always be
Somewhere in between, you and I will always meet
Come meet me in the middle, right there where we always be
Somewhere in between, you and I will always meet
Come meet me in the middle (You and I will always be)
Come meet me in the middle (Somewhere in between)
Come meet me in the middle (You and I will always meet)
Somewhere in between
You and I will always be

[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
Yeah, uh huh
Yeah

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
I'm workin' on a world premiere
And I could see the world from here
They ask me where I'm going from here
Shit, anywhere long as the runway is clear
Shit, music business movin' too fast for me (God damn)
Wishin' I still had Mac wit' me (Yes Lawd!)
How do you tell a nigga slow it down when you livin' just as fast as 'em?
I couldn't understand when I seen 'em stretched out cold on the pavement
Niggas catch T-K-O's on occasion
Wishin' I could save 'em, what was I to say?
I was doin' dates, dippin' in and out of state
We was goin' in to get away
Sick of feelin' so outta place
Wishin' I could save ya, what was I to say?
Wishin' I could save ya, but now it's too late
Now, is this really what I wanted?
Is it really worth the pain?
Now am I really an asshole? Fuck what you say
Don't do me no favors, let's get back to basics
We live for today, bitch, fuck up out my way, bitch
I'm losin' all my aces, I'm runnin' outta patience
Got some pretty faces knowin' what my name is
Up in high places, I got some new neighbors
They don't really say shit but when they see the spaceship
They just think I rap or some form of entertainment
But they don't know I'm black, young, gifted and amazin'

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
You know I had to close my eyes, yeah
And if I have to free my mind
I may not have the lane, movin' all along
Knowin' that I can't do it on my own
And if I got the pain feelin' comin' out
Have to run away, think I'm goin' home

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
Yeah, you know I'm workin' on a world premiere
And I could see the world from here
I know you somewhere in the atmosphere
I know someday I'll meet you halfway there (Cheers)
They say there's nothin' you can do about it
Can't say that I'm new to sorrow
Wishin' I could take your problems
Trade 'em for a little more time wit'chu
Carry you out the bottom, the weight of the world, I got it
Sprouted wit'chu on my shoulder, the greatest honor to know ya
I'd gotta be honest wit'cha, I hate you ain't in the picture
I hate all them fake niggas claimin' like they gon' really miss ya
I know there's no one to blame and maybe the point that I'm missin'
But I needed a minute, just give me a minute

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
You know I had to close my eyes, yeah
And if I have to free my mind
I may not have the lane, movin' all along
Knowin' that I can't do it on my own
And if I got the pain feelin' comin' out
Have to run away, think I'm goin' home

[Break: Anderson .Paak]
Oh, say it ain't so!
Tears keep fallin' down my eyes
Damn it, I miss you, I should be with you
Can't turn back the hands of time but I should be with you
I miss my friend
Damn it, I miss you
Cannot bring you back

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
These pictures I'm seein' are fuckin' me up
And I don't know what to do but reminisce and face the pain
Back in the day before you were a dog and you were just pup
Bangin' beats and bringin' bitches back to the tour bus
Excuse me, y'all, I know this .Paak shit, I just need a second
It's Q-Tip in this bitch and I'm just in here reflectin'
Head on collisions with memories in the intersection
Lookin' in my rearview, wishin' I could be near you
The freeways of my mind are crowded with traffic
The good times that we had and them bad habits
Look at me now, look around, last man standin'
Grown man cryin' like a child tryna understand it
So sick of sendin' flowers to all of my brother's mommas
Don't know what's harder, fightin' trauma or keepin' a promise
A true confession breath is a blessin', without a question
But niggas don't get the message until they get disconnected
My story ain't over, I'm still turnin' pages
But the picture I painted with you in it has faded
My queen, my dreams and even my wages
I know what it means to lose everything when you made it
Rags to the riches and back to the rags is a muh'fucka
The consequence of puttin' all your chips in one bucket
To be honest, I feel like gettin' right back to these commas
You motherfuckers keep the drama

[Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I'm workin' on a world premiere
And I could see the world from here
I know there must be somethin' after here
I know some day I'll meet ya halfway there in the atmosphere
Cheers

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Free my mind
You know I had to close my eyes
Close my eyes
You know I have to free my mind
Oooooh
You know I had to close my eyes
You know it's time for me...
You know I have to free my mind

[Outro]
Free my...
Free
Free
Free my...
...My mind
My mind
My Mind

[Intro]
Ohh yeah
Ohh yeah

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Okay, I got me a sweet bitch

Hell naw, you shouldn't be eatin' dick

And she nasty, she wild, she a free spirit
After me, she gon' let the whole team hit it
Goddamn, why can't you be more discreet wit' it?
I'm at peace wit' it
Come on, peace, kid
(Spotlight, that's just my life and time)
Yeah, it ain't much, look
Okay, I got me a cheap broad

She be cussin' out the managers at restaurants
Every time we go to dinner, shit is free of charge
I got me a centerfold, kinda sorta
But she poppin' on the Insta though
She gon' have a million followers by the winter time
After that she'll be somebody that I used to know
(Spotlight, that's just my life and time)
I had to let her go, you know?
Had a Xan ho
She be mumblin' and hard to understand though
She in love with all the trappers from Atlanta
Introduced her to T.I. and that was the last time I had her
Got a skater bitch
She a gamer, gotta take her to arcades and shit
She be watchin' Anime while I'm layin' dick
Wanna go to Comic Con, I'm like "Come down a bit"
(Spotlight, that's just my life and time)
I like gangsta shit, uh
Speakin' of which, got a gangsta boo
Man, her mama and her grandmama gangsta too
With the drama, keep the llama in the daisy dukes
Shit, if I try to take her to the party, she gon' shoot up the room
(Fuck outta here, nigga, run ya shit, run ya shit)
Ooh, got a lazy bitch
Oh, I'ma do it tomorrow, tomorrow came and went
Ain't no fuckin' at the crib, it's probably dirty as shit
How you runnin' outta breath when you ridin' the dick?
Ho, oh nah, nah, nah
You gotta get the fuck up off me right now
Oh, baby, I been thinkin' 'bout
What I gotta do all day and I'm fuckin' tired, Wilma tired
(Spotlight, that's just my life and time)
Damn, okay, I got it
Got a cougar bitch
We be fuckin' in the back of Subarus and shit
I would love to spend the night, there's always food in the fridge
She be knowin' what she like and what to do wit' it
Uh, throwin' me around, wasn't used to it (Wasn't used to it)
Gotta tell my bigger homie how abusive she is
Nigga, no one would believe me, they like "You just a bitch"
Had to buy surveillance cameras to get proof of it
Damn
(Spotlight, that's just my life and time)
I'm suin' you, bitch

[Verse 2: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Well, I got a tight ass one from Chicago (From Chicago)
She said she lowkey but everybody know (Everybody know)
Bitch is from Heaven, mattress on the floor (Whoa)
Invite her to the crib, show her how I live
But she bought some roaches, no
Next stop, Ohio (Ohio)
Her mom's shoppin' these parts from Mexico (Mexico)
She demand the D before and after show (After show)
These are the ups and downs when we're in the
(Spotlight, that's just my life and time)
Ooh, yeah, baby, baby, yeah
Yeah, baby
Ah, ohh
Darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin'

[Break: Anderson .Paak & BJ the Chicago Kid]
Okay, ha, shit

Girl, I'm back to act a fool wit' it

Real life, I know you miss me like you miss Obama
Real time, I been gettin' busy with them commas
Feels like I've been livin' life without a conscience
Realize that you're fuckin' with a real monster

You're too lie, ya say ya do what ya don't
See me now, you need fi hang up me coat
Big cloud, you see the ting weh me smoke

They wanna break bread? Fuck it, I'll give 'em a loaf
I always encourage a nigga growth
Bad gyal, hold me down, never go

Remindin' me what I do this for
So critical, so physical
So difficult, but still a miracle

[Verse 3]
I'm fuckin' up the weekend, I'm jumpin' off the deep end
I'm high as fuck in this bitch, think I'm finally peakin'
They wanna see me in a cell, they want me in the precinct
They wanna see me broke and sad, they want me street-sweepin'
They keep screamin' about, "Give us somethin' decent"
Now, why you disturbin' me now? Bitch, I'm in a meetin'

[Chorus]

Your side of the bed still smells like you though

You know, you know exactly how I feel
We broke up, but you be on my mind still
And the worst type of sadness you could have
Is when you miss somethin' that doesn't miss you back

Put all your stuff in a box in my room
I don't wanna write no song about you
But you show up in everything that I do
Ooh, ooh-ooh

Ayy, it smell like my momma’s cooking

I wing it like an angel
Singing like an angel
Get it on a video and beam at every angle

Just another day in the life of a queen
It ain’t 'bout the money honey it’s about the bling
Tell 'em kick rocks if they’re training for a team
And if the sun don’t rise
I raise my Tiffany’s eye
Baby, I’m feeling just like I’m picking a lie
Gotta be tripping to get me sleeping at night
Baby, you can’t shine like me
Swimming in the 24K
Caught winning in the party, aye
Once you get it you don’t want no other way
No other way

[Verse 3: Wes Period]
My chain sound like Alanis Morissette
Blues and Reds, açaí invisible set
Precious metals mixed together
VVS baguettes
You need a big fat check
To get these drips like Wes
Uh, my diamonds pack a punch like that
Gal, your pockets looking famished
Pack a lunch before you pass out
Celine dissect with rubies this is saline solution
If your diamonds sound like drool
You need to get a better jeweler

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
This one is hot, that one like ice
This one is loud (Yea), that one is quiet
You can hear my diamond (Ring)

Woah
Falling in love
Cats got my tongue
Talk to me pretty please
Doubt you would
Cause I could just go
All on my own
Don’t waste my time
Because my love is bomb

[Verse 1]
My love’s a bomb
My hugs are strong
You know it
My jungle is showing
I cut the lawn
You with it
I fuck til’ dawn
My bucks are long
I pay up
I got this one
Yeah, that’s on me for dinner
He’s loser sore, he’s got to cuff the winner
Dress on tight, gots to cut with scissors
Up first thing in the morning
And make us breakfast
Gives the neck in the morning
That’s a necklace
Paint you the picture
Like I’m Van Gogh
Power couple we run it
Our love don’t blow
If you needed some company
Hun come through
We could kick it and chop it
Like I’m Kung Fu
Loves hard to but love comes—

[Outro]
—love is
My love
My love is
My love is
My love is bomb

[Verse 1 - Kina Grannis]
I couldn’t see the forest through the trees
Cause I was always staring at the problem
I was always falling on my knees
Didn’t see you there to pick me up
Until you weren’t there one day
My blue skies, now they all turned grey
It’s hard to trust in a heart
That’s too broke to follow, tell you that without you I’m…

[Chorus]
Hollow, I feel hollow like bamboo
快樂之後的不快樂好像沒有人記得，也湊合(without you)
Swallow, hard to swallow, it's the truth
活得清白，活得渾濁，沒了你我怎麼活
I’m just hollow like bamboo
I’m just hollow like bamboo

[Verse 2 - Jason Zhang]
交換過的不只是年輕
還有空虛落地的聲音
如果可以足夠的幸運
一定聽得懂誠實的焦慮
愛與索取的間距
雙手合十的縫隙
好不容易記起你來時的樣子
怎麼捨得叫醒你……

[Chorus]
Hollow, I feel hollow like bamboo
快樂之後的不快樂好像沒有人記得，也湊合(without you)
Swallow, hard to swallow, its the truth
活得清白，活得渾濁，沒了你我怎麼活
I’m just hollow like bamboo

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Bamboo, oooh ooh ooh, ooh
Hollow like bamboo, Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Hollow like bamboo, Ooh ooh ooh, ooh

When I’m feelin it feelin, I feel it flash back
What’s written in my past, I’m out to match that
That’s why I’m spending all my nights up with the trees, searching for melodies
Feeling chills, finding electricity
I’m never gone gone gone, Just in another zone
Music on my mind, Love and grind, feelin good n grown
If you don’t see me again, you’ll feel the shadow
Throw the rope, reel you back in, My magic lasso…hollow

多相信你
富有的 貧窮的 都愛著 (without you I’m…)
富有過 貧窮過 都愛了 (​​without you I’m…)
Without you

[Chorus]
Hollow, I feel hollow like bamboo
快樂之後的不快樂好像沒有人記得，也湊合(without you)
Swallow, hard to swallow, its the truth
活得清白，活得渾濁，沒了你我怎麼活
I’m just hollow like bamboo

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Bamboo, oooh ooh ooh, ooh
Hollow like bamboo, Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Hollow like bamboo, Ooh ooh ooh, ooh

[Intro]
Flo Rida got a story to tell (a story to tell, a story to tell)

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
There once was a man that lived in a shoe
Next to a bakery that I knew
His excuse? He had a sweet tooth
Ever since the days of his youth
I love cake, he said, me too
Tastes so good, I drive in the coupe
(E'eryday) trapped and come through
(E'eryday) catching that loot
For some strange reason, his shop never closed
And everybody leaving had powder on their nose
Dunkin' lines, Betty Crocker, bankrolls

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
We eating everyday (Rick), go check my resume (Ross)
I'm doing Mary Jane, off in this seven tre
Yeah, I got twenty whips, close to forty women
So I get plenty lips, I love swimming
I'm shining everyday, you shining once a year
Multi-millionaire, I had a monster year
We on monster trucks, so yeah we crushing haters
Never squashing beef, got too much paper
You don't know, you better look around
Poe Boy, the biggest crooks in towns
Little niggas like "put me down"
50 grand just to book me now
Rolling up on the good, we now
Who you hoes calling pugwee now?
Baddest chicks wanna fuck me now
They screaming loud, like it's a touchdown

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
I can spend hundred thousand in a day making cake
E'eryday (e'eryday), e'eryday (e'eryday)
Coming through your hood in a seven tre, gettin' cake
E'eryday (e'eryday), e'eryday (e'eryday)
I told y'all: I don't want no cake on my birthday, I want my cake E'eryday, e'eryday
I can spend hundred thousand in a day making cake
E'eryday (e'eryday), e'eryday (e'eryday)

[Verse 3: Flo Rida]
I don't want cake on the day I was born
I want my cake like I waked up and yawned
Flo Rida built like a Catholic with yarn
Look up my stacks ?
Rubber bands on a hundred grand
I'm in love with that cake from thuggin' man
I'm in the trap where they baking in the oven, man
Crystal, rose, keep bubbling
If you ain't talking about your birthday
You probably ain't had cake in the first place
I go hard until the block hit first day
I do my part for Poe Boy, my birthplace
I stood on the block on the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
I'm still in the hood, ain't got away
Carol City, all good, MIA
I'm on my grind, I gotta have my Dunkin' Lines
Betty Crocker on my mind, everyday, 3-65
Flo Rida own a bakery line, look at them drones chasing me now
I get known for basically rhymes
Do what I want, I got dolla' signs

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
I can spend hundred thousand in a day making cake
E'eryday (e'eryday), e'eryday (e'eryday)
Coming through your hood in a seven tre, gettin' cake
E'eryday (e'eryday), e'eryday (e'eryday)
I told y'all: I don't want no cake on my birthday, I want my cake E'eryday, e'eryday
I can spend hundred thousand in a day making cake
E'eryday (e'eryday), e'eryday (e'eryday)

[Verse 4: Torch]
Happy birthday, baby, what's your birthplace?
Where your birthmark? What's your zodiac and birthday?
I'm gettin' money, that's the only cake I ever knew
Fifty thousand the closest thing to candles I ever blew
I close my eyes, made a wish and it came true
Now I'm rocking clubs, arena and all the bigger venues
Everyday we balling, tipping the phantom pricin'
Hit the club, I come out wearing all the icin'
I know the wrist enticing, why the Bentley brightest
Some like a bitch sound lightning
Chris came hard and I can do it again
See Flo Rida like my brother, he my twin

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
I can spend hundred thousand in a day making cake
E'eryday (e'eryday), e'eryday (e'eryday)
Coming through your hood in a seven tre, gettin' cake
E'eryday (e'eryday), e'eryday (e'eryday)
I told y'all: I don't want no cake on my birthday, I want my cake E'eryday, e'eryday
I can spend hundred thousand in a day making cake

This time I'm coming out on my parole
Had your time with the Bentley, the gold
The yoga, Prada, bling-bling's gone
Nuttin' goin' on but the rent
Life-forsaken bread and bacon

Do you not know how to be on the ground?
You swallow, fuck that cause you got no backbone

[Chorus]

Catch yourself insane, then it get me
'Nuff of them men, try take liberties
I've got the back bone, don't need yours
'Nuff of them deals say, "Oh no, go!"
Meow, meow, pussycat turned tiger
If you don't know it goes, "Rawr, rawr!"
More bounce in the ounce than gunpowder
Make you play position, defender

[Verse 1]
You called me, tried to shake the other line
In a hurry, know you didn't have the time
To wait on my broken promises
I sought you, the reason with no rhyme

[Pre-Chorus]
We tried to work it out, we tried way back when
Your heart was spilling over without an end
I hurt you once before I hurt you again
You lost the faith that you had, had trusted in
So

[Chorus]
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from us
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from us
After all we've been through so much, woah
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from love
A break from love
A break from love

[Verse 2]
This journey will have its ups and downs
Su-sustaining will last a test of trial
This burning will only last a while
First degree burns don't leave scars
We can turn this plane around

[Pre-Chorus]
We tried to work it out, we tried way back when (way back when)
Your heart was spilling over without an end (without an end)
I hurt you once before I (I hurt you) hurt you again (again and again)
You lost the faith that you had (yeah), had trusted in (trusted in)
So

[Chorus]
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from us
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from us
After all we've been through so much, woah
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from love
A break from love
A break from love
A break from love
A break from love

[Chorus]
After all we've been through so much, woah
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from love
A break from love
A break from love

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
Say, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga

[Verse 1: Brisco]
Only 

[?] be amazed, blowing big in the coupe
Prada loafers on the pedal as the dons shoot through
Been accused before my court date
I'm at the Ritz hotel, eating skirt steak
By the way, I met this bitch named Jezabel
She say her brother keep them numbers on that fish scale
'Til she exhale, girl, I be a real nigga
I know you heard that before, but I'ma deal wit you
On the low, Young Money help me sleep safe
If I rent some Weezy P and send a briefcase
I'm pimpalicious, explicit, and it's the way I live it
After we fuck, we can trade in your Honda Civic

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
Say, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
(Flo Rida)
Like, damn, like I'm a human chandelier
Some Louis XIII standing next to a beer
Like Oprah Winfrey, women got her tongue pierced
Mike Tyson in the building, he just bit another ear
Like, round one, round two, round three
It's red carpet and I'm dressing like the referee
So many blood diamonds, Red Cross sweating me
Thrilla in Manila, are they staring at my ring?
That's about worth, Dolly Frazier, Don King
Senior high or junior high or elementary
They sweating like Keith cos my jewelry on me
That's my rhythm in blue stones, they dance like bling bling

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
Cause another fucking nigga ain't shit

[Outro: Lil Wayne]

Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife

I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like, ain’t no nigga like, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
Said, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
Cause another fucking nigga ain't shit
I talkin' bout
Cause, ain’t no nigga like, ain’t no nigga like, ain’t no nigga like me

[Verse 1]
Djesse has a sky like a merry-go-round
Making circles in a mind made of tapestry
And the world outside never seems to make a sound
So he lives inside his world full of majesty
Djesse close his eyes and sees the rain rise up
From the deep blue waters of infinity
He says, "I wish I knew the reason for the fire in my heart
But I can’t seem to tell you why it burns for me"

[Chorus]
Oh Djesse, won't you come back home (Back home)
(Oh, Djesse, won't you come back home)
Oh Djesse, won't you come back home (Back home, come back)
Come home

[Verse 2]
I said, "Djesse, you've been silent for your whole, whole life
How I wish I knew the world burning in your heart
I've been listening to the words and the kookaburra birds
But I can’t see the fire you've been singing of"
He said, "The moon’s so high and the water’s so wide
And you’re never gonna find what you're searching for
But deep inside you, there’s a world with a merry-go-round
Like a sky, such a fire you've never felt before"

[Chorus]
Oh Djesse, won't you come back home (Back home)
(Oh, Djesse, won't you come back home)
Oh Djesse, won't you come back home (Come back, come back)
Come home

[Bridge]
Oh Djesse, set me free, set me free, set me free
Oh Djesse, set me free, let me be what you can be
Oh Djesse, set me free, set me free, set me free
Oh Djesse, set me free, let me be what you can be
Oh Djesse, set me free, set me free, set me free
Oh Djesse, set me free, let me be what you can be
Oh Djesse, set me free, set me free, set me free
Oh Djesse, set me free, let me be what you can be

[Outro]
Said, Djesse, close your eyes and be free
Djesse (Djesse, oh oh), be who you wanna be
Djesse (Djesse, oh oh), close your eyes and you'll see
(Djesse, Djesse, Djesse, oh, Djesse)
Djesse (Djesse, oh oh), be who you wanna be
(Djesse, Djesse, Djesse, Djesse, set me free)
Djesse (Djesse, oh oh), close your eyes and be free
(Djesse closed his eyes, sees the rain rise up)
Djesse (Djesse, oh oh), be who you wanna be
(Djesse knows the reason for the fire in my heart)
Oh Djesse, set me free, let me be who you can be
Djesse, close your eyes and be free
Oh Djesse, set me free, set me free, set me free
Djesse, be who you wanna be
Oh Djesse, set me free, let me be who I can be

Stay woke, what the fuck do I need with a bed?
Stay slicing the loaf, yeah we breakin' the bread
Gettin' paid in gold, not paid in lead
If we're paid to approach, I am not a celeb
I speak in quotes so you repeat what I said
I hope you writin' this down and recordin' this sound
Listen up, gather round, I'm about to announce
A new update, we gon' dominate, spread the fan base
Rampage, kill a whole scene, someone bring me yellow tape
You eat the yellowtail, I'mma eat the plant-based

He's not evil
Just a useless son of the devil
Lets put the Prozac in his mouth
Watch him choke and spit it out
He deserves what he receives, baby
Don't you?
She's a creature
A lover and a teacher
And like a baby on the beach
She lets the water touch her feet
But she will fall back from the tide, baby
Don't you?

[Chorus]
So cold
It's so cold
So cold
It's so cold

[Verse 2]
Lets pretend

We will disguise what we ignore
And I'll love you

It's so cold
So cold
It's so cold

You say you ain't got time for games
No more games
But the world got time for games with you
Play your own
Playing with your money and your heart
Just admit you don't know what to do
I've seen a lot of things come and go
Lots of pimps and tons of hoes
How this ends, we'll never know

[Chorus]
A king in his castle
A king of the hill
Wasting his time
Chasing cheap thrills
He knows it's gonna cost him
God knows how much

[Verse 2]
But you know you gotta pay to play (Pay to play)
At the end of the day (At the end of the day)
Playing with your money and your heart
There's got to be another way

A king in his castle
A king of the hill
Wasting his time
Chasing cheap thrills
He knows it's gonna cost him
God knows how much

Oh, you're 'bout to catch a flow
It'll be so lovely, so lovely
Think I should tell you
Tell you how it goes
You chilling with the Sok
Sok or that purple

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
One hit, take me away
To another time, another space, another day
One more hit, blow me away
I could find another place
So you can find another way

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Doing all the same stuff beside your boy
By the time I stepped through the door
I just wanna really tell you how I feel
Nobody else wants to keep it real
All the pretty girls stepping on the scene
Who can dress their ass off and their walk is mean
All they wanna do is get up on the floor
But the real cool people don't dance anymore

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
They just glidin', we glidin' (Glide)
They glidin', they glidin'
Just glidin', they glidin'
They glidin', they glidin'
They—

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
She's phased, he's in a daze
Thirsty girls look around
While the others frown, not doin' anything
So, get your kicks in whatever way
Then let me tell you to your face
'Cause it's a shame to let it go to waste

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]
Doing all the same stuff beside your boy
By the time, I stepped through the door
I just wanna really tell you how I feel
Nobody else wants to keep it real
All the pretty girls stepping on the scene
Who can dress their ass off and their walk is mean
All they wanna do is get up on the floor
But the really cool people don't dance anymore

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
They just glidin', we glidin' (Glide)
They glidin', they glidin'
Just glidin', they glidin'
They glidin', they glidin'
They—

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]
Sometimes people think that
They can fool the world into believing
That they are original
But they are only fools
So I, find a place in my mind
Where nobody else can go
Drifting, floating, gliding
So meet me there

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa & Chris Brown]
Now a nigga glidin'
Do it from the front, back to the side and
I gotta roll one up 'fore a nigga drivin'
Blow a couple hunnid
You might think it's stuntin'
But to me it's really nothin', oh
Who you came with? (With)
Who the ones spendin' money like it ain't shit? (Shit)
Me, and I'm poppin' champagne
Hella niggas in here rollin' with me throwin' up the gang (Up the gang)
Um
You ain't gotta ask, already know
You don't need a grinder 'cause they already rolled
And everything I blow is potent in the air
'Cause me and Breezy got 'em floating (Haha)
What you smoking? (Smoking)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Wiz Khalifa]
Glidin', we glidin' (Hahaha)

Me and my gang
In here super fucked up off the same thing
I need my shades (I need my shades)
(I need my shades, I need my shades)

[Verse 1]
I'm your biggest fan, but I guess that's just not good enough
Is it cause I wear my hair weird or because I like to play Diablo (x2)

[Chorus]
You stuck me in the friend zone

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Because I'd rather play Mortal Kombat anyway, hey
I'm all about my Johnny Cage

[Chorus]
You stuck me in the friend zone
That's that bullshit (x2)
I'm gonna play Diablo either way
You can come or you can go

[Verse 2 (repeated)]
Because I'd rather play Mortal Kombat anyway

[Verse 3]
You can come or you can go
Because I'd rather play Mortal Kombat anyway, hey
I'm all about my Johnny Cage
I'm all about my Johnny Cage

[Intro: Action Bronson]
Ah, yeah, ah, ah, ah
Yeah, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
I'm glad I never used cocaine, 'cause I would be an addict
Running 'round town ass naked, chase rabbit
They found me face down at the Great Lake Tavern
A payday pattern, the fake ID said “JJ Adams”
My other one was stolen by a madame
She whispered to the hooker like, “We have him”
She was right, I was blinded by the pussy like
Gotta make it home because my wifey said it's cookie night
Plus I owe two hundred large to the bookie
I think I might boogie

[Verse 2: Meyhem Lauren]
Head crack, bread stack, I'm a G
Iced out like Pat Ewing's knee
All white, alright, I'm the hood pope
Break night, take flight, got the good dope
Adidas Boost on, looking like a highlighter
True fact, I'm a livewire
Got denied at the red light district
Shorty said I probably break wombs with this dick
My life is the fountain of youth
Let a rapper talk slick, he'll get found in the booth
Draw mom on my face and rock one gold tooth
Then it's back to the strip, gotta get more loot
Persian lamb jackets, chinchilla collars
Surgeon hand ratchets, winners get dollars

[Non-Lyrical Vocals]

[Intro]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Motherfucker, know you hear me

Queens shit
Motherfucking World Cup starts today
You better be watching that shit in Spanish
Pussy

[Verse]
You can keep your little bullshit advance, understand?
I’m in the Amazon chewing on plants
Motherfuckers can’t afford me
Plus, I’m in the middle of this orgy and send me back in like 40
Shit, I live so much, no time for looking back, only up
'Cause there’s no roof on the truck, you could shoot a duck
I know that’s cruel as fuck, and, no, I wouldn’t recommend it
Did I mention? The Porsche 911 got a second engine
Send your boy into the Seventh Dimension, shit
Hell is cheap, baby, Heaven’s expensive though
Yours truly, ‘bout to get this paper like Judge Judy
Told my baby, “Come do me”, all these drugs just run through me
Now I’m shredding the guitar on a mountain
God damn, something groovy
Aw, man, we lost ‘em to the lights again
Bitch, don’t worry, I’ll be back like lightning
Just don’t blink ‘cause you might miss me
I’m about to make history, raise your motherfucking fist for me
And let your middle finger fly up and grab your nut sack
And scream, “Fuck that”, you hear me?

[Intro]
Sniff a little coke, please, don’t go to sleep yet
I kn-I-I know, I know
Pour some water on your face, do some jumping jacks
We about to leave, it’s me, it’s me, yo

[Verse 1]
Who could it be? It’s me, running down brick lane
With a visible limp (Uh), and an alligator pimp cane (Uh)
Rubies where the eyes go (Yeah), car so low (Yeah)
Gotta drive this slow (Yeah, yeah)
Black windows like we hiding, ho
Fuck the 5-0, unless we talking ‘bout the ‘Stang (Mustang)
Man, I’m just watching all these actors from the rafters like Sting
In the surveillance van, fucking with computers like Ving (Ving)
Hundred milli’, that’s a light ching, shoot him in the right wing

[Chorus]
Don’t wanna drink, don’t wanna smoke
Don’t wanna smoke no more
You fucking stupid? I’m tryna do all that shit
Don’t wanna smoke, don’t wanna drink
Don’t wanna drink no more
You fucking stupid? I’m tryna do all that shit

[Verse 2]
Listen, tiger, my shit fire (True), hard to forget like a thick Maya (Damn)
I like my mind a little bit higher (Higher)
I need the violin section tighter (Make it tight)
And if you need to drive the ‘Vette (What)
I left the keys by the tire, tiger (Thank you), just be humble
‘Cause if I punch you in the chest, you’ll do a hundred yard tumble (Uh)
Standing over victims like Mutumbo with the finger waving (No, no, no, no, no)
I’m such a motherfucking player
My hair should be in finger waves, uh (God damn)

[Chorus]
Don’t wanna drink, don’t wanna smoke
Don’t wanna smoke no more
You fucking stupid? I’m tryna do all that shit
Don’t wanna smoke, don’t wanna smoke
Don’t wanna smoke no more (What)
You fucking stupid (What)? I’m tryna do all that shit
I wanna drink, don’t wanna smoke, don’t wanna drink no more
You fucking stupid (What)? I’m tryna do all that shit (I know)
I wanna drink, I wanna smoke
Iwanna smoke some more (Some more)
Yeah, I’m tryna do all that shit

Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Uh
Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
It's the captain, skipper

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
To all the women that I hurt in the past, I didn't mean it (Sorry)
Now that we clear, come here, put your mouth right here (Uh huh)
I'm rare like a white deer with spiked hair (Uh)
New Nike Airs, smoke big cigars in a nice chair (Uh)
Oh why, oh why do I feel like I'm starving in Lionheart?
And sniffled every drug that's on the science chart (Damn)
I got a Mayan heart and I'm running
Like I'm Deion once the sirens start
Ring ring by the park, my pants keep falling
I hop the fence easy (Uh)
They stopped chasing, damn, my ID dirty
Habañero, eat thirty, swerve off (Skrt)
Genesis, I Can't Dance blasting
Heavy metal hand clapping, captain, uh

[Refrain: Big Body Bes]
Machine gun money

[Break: Action Bronson]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's me

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
I'ma stay fly until I'm up on that big spaceship in the sky (Sky)
The money coming with me when I die (Yes)
My drugs are coming with me when I die (Uh)
Nobody better cry (No), nobody better cry, man (No)
If you need me, I'm at the bottom of Lake Titicaca
Watching Euro Cup soccer, Portugal won, it was a shocker (Uh)
This rhythm open up my chakra (Uh)
And it keep telling me to cop the Porsche in aqua (Ooh)
It also said your boy is destined for an Oscar (Ooh)
And for my birthday, mommy blessed me with a chopper (Oh)
On my worst day, you couldn't clean my boxers
Or diagnose this mind with eighty doctors (Uh)
Life's a box of chocolates, it's me, man

[Refrain: Big Body Bes]
Machine gun money

[Intro: A$AP Rocky & Action Bronson]

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
The style icon, ’bout to get the dough like taekwon
Beat the pythons, when I fuck I like to leave the lights on
I'm just a piece of art
All these tattoos hidden under bracelets on my right arm
Shit, I need some tiger balm, I don't even like this song
Yeah, I skrrt 911s better with that other one
Man, these pussies love to run, but they always runner-up
I ain’t with that funny stuff, yeah, I'm 'bout that money up
Leave 'em sunny up, give 'em tummy tuck
Bronson always hit that fucking target, never dummy luck
In these fucking streets, you get your collar popped for 20 bucks
And I'm just focused on these hoes that's on the honey nuts

[Chorus: Action Bronson & A$AP Rocky]
I swerve on 'em, skrrt on ’em, swerve on ’em, swerve on 'em
High as fuck, your boy almost hit the curb on ’em
Swerve on 'em (Yeah, yeah), swerve on 'em, skrrt on 'em (Yeah, yeah)
Looking like you need some help (Yeah, yeah), throw a bird on ’em

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Had a funny feeling you fronting, every time I see you, you phony
Bitch, everything Johnny, jabroni, everything gettin' jolly, lil homie
Ever since my childhood, I grown to be, astonishing, notice me
Just notice me, I make her cream, call me Jodeci
Man, I ride like you're slow to leave, niggas know Flacko Jodye
Took a toke, nigga, pour the lean, feeling stomach pains, nausea
Had me absent, no notary, no, no, nothing to sober me up
Fell asleep, go to sleep, my niggas still asleep, rest in peace
Ready or not, here I come, man, I feel like a refugee
You just captain, Captain Save-A-Ho, hoes screaming, “Come rescue me”
Man, I came for the best, so who claim they the best?
Swore she knew what was best for me, when she left, took what's left of me

[Chorus: Action Bronson]
I swerve on 'em, swerve on 'em
Skrrt on 'em, swerve on 'em
Swerve on 'em, swerve on 'em
Your boy almost hit the curb on 'em

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
Had a funny feeling you fronting, every time I see you, you phony
Bitch, everything Johnny, jabroni, everything getting jolly, lil homie
Ever since my childhood, I grown to be, astonishing, notice me
Just notice me

[Verse 3: Action Bronson]
Baby, just notice me
I'm in the green Lotus Jeep, try not to go to sleep
Don't let the devil take control of me
My eyes closed, but I know where I'm going
It started snowing and I started dancing
And I started crying, bitch, it's Johnny Handsome
I dive off boats, jump out of planes ass naked
Swervin' Maserati trucks in the rain
Man, it's all about the hunger and pain
And to this jungle, I came
With these drugs all in my lungs and my veins

[Outro: A$AP Rocky & Action Bronson]
(Had a funny feeling you fronting) You know (Every time I see you, you phony) True
(Bitch, everything Johnny, jabroni) Uh (Everything getting jolly, lil homie) Uh
(Ever since my childhood, I grown to be, astonishing, so to speak, just notice me)
Just notice me, baby, just notice me

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, baby
From the day I saw you
I really really wanna catch your eye
There's something special ’bout you
I must really like you
There's not a lotta guys are worth my time
Ooh baby, baby, baby
It's gettin’ kind of crazy
'Cause you are takin' over my mind

[Chorus]
And it feels like ooh
But you don't know my name
And I swear, it feels like ooh (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)

[Verse 2]
Oh, baby baby baby
I see us on our first date
You’re doin’ everything that makes me smile
And when we had our first kiss
It happened on a Thursday
Ooh, it set my soul on fire
Ooh baby, baby, baby
I can't wait for the first time
My imagination’s runnin' wild

[Chorus]
It feels like ooh
But you don't know my name
And I swear it, baby, it feels like ooh (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
But you don't know my name
(’Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)

[Bridge]
"I'm sayin', he don't even know what he's doin' to me
Got me feelin' all crazy inside
I'm feelin like, "Oww! (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Doin' more than I've ever done for anyone's attention
Take notice of what's in front of you
'Cause did I mention?
You're 'bout to miss a good thing
And you'll never know how good it feels to have all of my affection
And you'll never get a chance to experience my lovin'

[Chorus]
'Cause my lovin' feels like ooh
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)
And I swear it feels like ooh (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)

[Post-Chorus]
Will you ever know it?
No no no no no, no no
Will you ever know it?

[Spoken Interlude]
"I'm gonna have to just go ahead and call this boy
Hello? Can I speak to -- to Michael?
Oh hey, how you doin'?
Uh, I feel kinda silly doin' this, but uhh...
This is the waitress from the coffee house on 39th and Lennox
You know, the one with the braids?
Yeah, well I see you on Wednesdays all the time
You come in every Wednesday on your lunch break, I think
And you always order the special, with the hot chocolate
And my manager be tripping and stuff
Talking 'bout we gotta use water
But I always use some milk and cream for you
'Cause I think you're kinda sweet
Anyway, you always got on some fly blue suit
'N your cuff links are shining all bright
So, whatchu do? Oh, word? Yeah, that's interesting
Look man, I mean I don't wanna waste your time, but...
I know girls don't usually do this
But I was wondering if maybe we could get together
Outside the restaurant one day?
'Cause I do look a lot different outside my work clothes
I mean, we could just go across the street to the park right here
Wait, hold up, my cell phone's breakin' up, hold up
Can you hear me now? Yeah
So, what day did you say?
Oh yeah, Thursday's perfect, man"

[Chorus]
And it feels like ooh
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)

[Outro]
And I swear on my mother and father it feels like...
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)
Heyo Brad
I know we're usually above this indie-rock beef type shit but
Man, I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of these bargain-basement Mac DeMarco-wannabes
You know I had to light up at least one of 'em
And yeah, 'cause he started it
Hey, Netherfriends
This one goes out to you, you fucking kook

Let me start with my thesis: fuck these lames
Who came to LA to take shots at my name
But I didn't come to chase fame or get paid
I'm a pretty girl, bitch, I just came to make graves
If you wanna fight, bitch, that's all right kid
You vers' me is ice cream versus ice pick
I think you sound like shit
Objectively
I'll split you up and down right quick
Symmetrically
Until your blood runs red on Sunset
Your body parts strewn all over Figueroa
Open up a gastro-pub on El Dorado
Serve us every bread with a slice of avocado
You can drink cool macchiatos 'til you're jittery
I bet you fall asleep with your head up in a guillotine
You're so prolific, let's put it to the test
I'll see how many records you can make with your dying breath
And you're the Kook of Echo Park
The Kook of Echo Park
The Kook of Echo Park

Let's talk straight
And cut through the nonsense
I make art, you make YouTube content
You can smoke weed every day but I'd smoke crack
And take a bat to that Panama hat, jack
And matter of fact, I might hit you where it hurts
Roll up on your boys, spray ketchup on your patterned shirt
And put a cease to that thrift-store chic
You Macklemore-looking motherfucker

You talk shit, I bet you're nice to my face
So if you wanna fight name a time and a place
How about the lake? Around about brunch?
I get the Glock and feed your fucking bones to a duck
We don't fuck
You should think before you diss-track
You wanna record? I treat the gun like a click track
On tempo
Put the steel to your temple
And turn the shot into a snare with your loop pedal

And you're the Kook of Echo Park
The Kook of Echo Park
The Kook of Echo Park
So let that be a lesson to all you self-hating hipsters
All you trust-fund troubadours out there
Hey yeah, you wanna take shots at the flock, I gots the chalk

And as for you, Netherfriends, well, I could probably sit here and diss you all day long, but
I'd have to Google you just to find out who the fuck you are, first
It's like, goddamn my dude
Ain't you ever heard of a little something called Quality Control?
I mean, how can one guy put out a hundred albums and have them all be terrible?
You'd think you'd get lucky every now and again just based on statistics alone, but
I dunno, I'mma help you out though
I know I can't teach you how to write a good song
I know I can't convince you to give up music altogether, but
If nothing else, maybe I can convince you
To take off that silly-ass fedora
It's like, you're not fooling anyone, my dude
You have a receding hairline, it's nothing to be ashamed of
It's very common for people your age, but
You're gonna wanna just fake it, get it over with and lean into the bald thing
You'll be better off
Peace

[Verse]
It's been so long since I have had Patron all night
I feel so good until daylight finds us
Let’s be honest, now and again
'Til daylight finds us
Let's be honest, now and again
’Til daylight finds us
And we'll be up baby, until the daylight breaks
And we'll be up, until the day starts to wake

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's take this time
Don't you let no one take us away
And tonight
We'll be home till the day awakes

[Chorus]
So don't let daylight find us
Don't let daylight find us
Don’t let daylight find us
Don’t let daylight find us (oh oh oh)
Don't let daylight find us (woah, oh oh)
Don’t let daylight find us

[Bridge]
And let's speed on, until the daylight breaks
Let's speed on, until the night sky turns grey

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's take this time
Don’t you let no one take us away
And tonight
We'll be home till the day awakes

[Chorus]
So don't let daylight find us
Don't let daylight find us
Don't let daylight find us
Don't let daylight find us (oh oh oh)
Don't let daylight find us (woah, oh oh)
Don't let daylight find us

[Outro]
So don't let daylight find us
Don't let daylight find us
Don't let daylight find us
Don't let daylight find us (oh oh oh)
Oh

(You got me mystified)

Oh
Pretty darling
This feeling is deep inside
You got me mystified (mystified, mystified, mystified)
(You got me mystified)

The light that shines around you
It blinds my eyes
There's a magic surrounds you
Tell me where your secret lies

Oh
Pretty darling
This feeling is deep inside
You got me mystified (mystified, mystified, mystified)
(You got me mystified)
Oh
Pretty baby
This feeling I just can't hide
You got me mystified (mystified, mystified)
You got me mystified (mystified, mystified, mystified)

Mystified

[Verse 1]
I've learned to slam on the brake
Before I even turn the key
Before I make the mistake
Before I lead with the worst of me

[Verse 2]
Give them no reason to stare
No slippin' up if you slip away
So I got nothing to share
No, I got nothing to say

[Pre-Chorus]
Step out, step out of the sun
If you keep getting burned, yeah
Step out, step out of the sun
Because you've learned, because you've learned

[Chorus]
On the outside, always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
Waving through a window, oh
I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
I'm waving through a window, oh
Can anybody see? Is anybody waving back at me?
(Back at me, back at me)

[Verse 3]
We start with stars in our eyes (Stars in our eyes)
We start believing that we belong (We belong)
But every sun doesn't rise (The sun doesn't rise)
And no one tells you where you went wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Step out, step out of the sun
If you keep getting burned, yeah
Step out, step out of the sun
Because you've learned, because you've learned

[Chorus]
On the outside, always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
Waving through a window, oh, oh
I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for the answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
I'm waving through a window, oh, oh
Can anybody see? Is anybody waving?

[Bridge]
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?
When you're falling in the forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?
When you're falling in the  forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?
Did I even make a sound?
Did I even make a sound?
It's like I never made a sound
Will I ever make a sound?

[Chorus]
On the outside, always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
Waving through a window, oh, oh
I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
Waving through a window, oh, oh
Can anybody see? Is anybody waving back at me?
(Back at me, back at me)

[Outro]
Is anybody waving? (Is anybody waving?)
Waving, waving, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
That last hour was the worst
When we remember forever
Blessing and a curse
If we could fall back one more hour

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe we could've made it work
Maybe we could've focused on each other first (Uh)
Could've left off on better terms
If we could fall back one more hour

[Chorus]
Daylight savings
Like daylight savings
If we could revisit that moment again
I would never let us end that way
Like daylight savings
Like daylight savings
If we could fall back one more hour

[Verse 2]
I watch time slip away
Like true love with no grip, that's right
Seen blue skies fade to gray, oh
If we could fall back one more hour

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe we could've made it work
Maybe we could've focused on each other first
Could've left off on better terms (Oh)
If we could fall back one more hour

[Chorus]
Daylight savings
Like daylight savings
If we could revisit that moment again
I would never let us end that way
Like daylight savings
Like daylight savings
If we could fall back one more hour

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe we could've made it work
Maybe we could've focused on each other first (Uh)
Could've left off on better terms
Oh, wish we could fall back one more hour

[Chorus]
Like daylight savings
Like daylight savings
If we could fall back one more hour (Uh)

[Outro]
Daylight savings, ah, ha
Daylight savings
Wish I could go back, ah ha ah ha

[Verse]
I didn't wanna knock her down, but I did though
Ten phones so a bitch don't get my info
I am way too poppin', lil’ bitch, I’m popular
She wanna be my main, I said that's way too cutthroat
My clothes line a bitch if she gon’ fold for
I can't let her, but you see me in public
She tried to walk out the room wearin' my merch
I said "Bitch, come back, that's my shirt"

[Pre-Chorus]
I got the plug straight from my mans and she was starstruck
Ten shows back to back, come to my concert
And then she pulled up, she pulled up, then I saw her
Oh my god, she’s a monster

[Chorus]
She's a monster, my god, she's a monster
She's a monster, my god, she's a monster
She's a monster, she's a monster
She's a monster, my god, she's a monster

Back when you used to be’s with that Crip
Gotta give a little to get
A little bit in return now, tables turn now
And you heard ’bout me and my bitch
I'm just tryna chill
’Cause lately I've been thinkin' 'bout you and rebuildin’
Walking 'round like you lost feelings
I can tell he not fulfilling
You in love with me still
They say only if looks could kill, for real
You walk around town with that guy
When you pass by (Ah-ah)
I just laugh like (Ah-ah)

Have you heard it on the news

Europe's an unhappy land (No, no, no, no)

Democrats are out of power
Across that great wide ocean
The orange one is President
Fascist God in motion
Generals tell him what to do
Stop your good time dancing
Train their guns on me and you
Fascist thang advancing
Sisters, brothers lend a hand
Increase our population
Grab that groove thang by the throat
And throw it in the ocean
You're real tonight, you move my soul
Let's cruise out on the dance floor
Come out your house and dance your dance
Shake that fascist groove thang (Shake it)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Anyway
You say I'm cold to the touch
Could told you this much (Woo!)
As I go for the gusto bending you over the hutch
But you're ready to spread
Can't tell if you're sweating

[Extended Snippet]
....Probably, what? Here to settle down...
(Laundry) Nurse (butthurt?)
Want me to do all the things
Remodel (yourself)
Yo' deck (dick)
I said (ford) you have balls
Incurable
Oh, shove a toilet (chuck-a-cord)
Thousand states, 'cause I enjoy(ed) it
Insykeable
Make a commitment and taking that step with a Fit-bit and (digged it) Only you can think about me, my figment....

[Chorus]
I got no wings to fly me, no song to sing me
No hand to hold me, no star to guide me
No tears to cry me, no fire to burn me
No sky above me, no Hell below me
No wind behind me, no path before me
No chains around me, no fear within me
But with the love in my heart, somehow I found you
But with the love in my heart, somehow I found you

[Verse 1]
He said "I need somebody understands my soul
Somebody to tell me where to go
And I don't wanna be traveling on my own"
She said, "I’ll be the one, let me come along"
He said, "Do you wanna dance with me, do you wanna dance?
I been sitting here too long
And my bones feel old, but my feet still young"
He said, "I've never met a girl I could hold so strong
I'm never gonna do you wrong
Now put your hands on me where they belong
And boogie with me all night long"
Boogie with me all night long
Baby, won’t you sing my song

[Verse 2]
She said, "I need somebody who can move my feet"
(Wiggle wiggle wiggle)
"Someone to make my heart beat
And I don't want you talking to me soft and sweet"
He said, "I'll be the one to make you feel complete"
She said, "Do you wanna sing with me, do you wanna sing?
I been talking here too long
How can your bones feel old with a voice so young?"
She said, "Djesse got a sky like a, a merry-go-round
But he don't ever make a sound
Now put your hands on me, baby, touch the ground
And give it to me up and down"

[Chorus]
I got no wings to fly me, no song to sing me
No hand to hold me, no star to guide me
No breeze to blow me, no tears to cry me
No fire to burn me, no sea to sail me
No sky above me, no Hell below me
No wind behind me, no path before me
No place to hide me, no lost to find me
No chains around me, no fear within me
No wings to fly me, no song to sing me
No hand to hold me, no star to guide me
No breeze to blow me, no tears to cry me
No fire to burn me, no sea to sail me
No sky above me, no Hell below me
No wind behind me, no path before me
No place to hide me, no lost to find me
No chains around me, no fear within me
No wings to fly me, no song to sing me
No hand to hold me, no star to guide me
No breeze to blow me, no tears to cry me
No fire to burn me, no sea to sail me
No sky above me, no Hell below me
No wind behind me, no path before me
No place to hide me, no lost to find me
No chains around me, no fear within me
But with the love in my heart, somehow, I found you

[Verse 3]
If I tell you all about it (Oh)
Would you tell me where to go?
And if all I know is nothing (Oh)
Would you tell me what I know?
If I tell you all about it (Tell me all about it)
Would you tell me where to go?
And if all I know is nothing (Tell them all about it)
Would you tell me what I know?
He said, "I need somebody make me lose control"

[Outro]
Keep in motion, stay unspoken
And if I'm broken, keep me open
Keep in motion (Keep in motion, keep in motion)
Stay unspoken (Stay unspoken, stay unspoken)
And if I'm broken (And if I'm broken, and if I'm broken)
Keep me open (Keep me open, keep me open)
Keep in motion (Keep in motion, keep in motion)
Stay unspoken (Stay unspoken, stay unspoken)
And if I’m broken (And if I’m broken, and if I'm broken)
Keep me open (Keep me open, keep me open)

[Verse 1]
Once a day, I rise
Once a day, I fall asleep with you
Once a day, I try but I can't find a single word
I wonder what they know
I wonder if they ever even cared at all
I wonder, do they see their own reflection in the rain
And look away?

[Chorus]
Everybody keep rushin'
Why aren't we taking our time?
Every now and again, baby, I get high

[Verse 2]
Don't ask me what I think
It never really mattered what I had to say
I just keep waiting for another open door
To come up soon
Don't keep it all in your head
The only place that you know nobody ever can see
You're running low on regret
No tears, that's keeping you wet
I think you gettin' it now

[Chorus]
But everybody keep rushin'
Why aren't we taking our time?
Every now and again, baby, I get high

[Bridge]
And everybody means something
When they're stuck on your mind
But every now and again, why can't we just be fine?

[Outro]
Once a day, I rise
Once a day, I fall asleep with you
Once a day, I try but I can't find a single word

[Intro]
Of course, you have to sing along!

[Verse 1]
I've had other guys
I've looked into their eyes
But I never knew love before
Until you walked through my door
I've had other lips
I've sailed a thousand ships
But no matter where I go
You're the one for me, baby this I know, 'cause it's

[Chorus]
True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm going to be true blue, baby, I love you

[Verse 2]
I've heard all the lines
I've cried oh-so many times
Those tear drops, they won't fall again
I'm so excited, 'cause you're my best friend
So if you should ever doubt
Wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember dear
Those words whispered in your ear, I said

[Chorus]
Cause it's true love (This time I know it's true love)
You're the one I'm dreaming of (The one I'm dreaming of)
Your heart fits me like a glove (Heart fits just like a glove)
And I'm going to be true blue, baby, I love you

[Bridge]
No more sadness
I kiss it goodbye
The sun is bursting right out of the sky
I searched the whole world for someone like you
Don't you know, don't you know that it's

[Refrain]
True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love it's (True love baby)
True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love it's

[Chorus]
True love (This time I know it's true love)
You're the one I'm dreaming of (The one I'm dreaming of)
Your heart fits me like a glove (Heart fits just like a glove)
And I'm going to be true blue, baby, I love you
I love you (And your six-pack, good body work)
Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Whoa, just talkin' on this
Whoa, whoa
Bentley Bentayga, Bentley coupe, two-lane
(ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney)
One hunnid thousand, loose change
Ayy, whoa, whoa

[Verse]
Bentley Bentayga, Bentley coupe, two-lane
One hunnid thousand, loose change
I got a bad lil' bih from the blue flame
She hopped on dick instantly when the crew came
Don't stand too close, we might blow like it's propane
Nosy-ass nigga probably do cocaine
I'm on these old niggas' heads just like road game (Fiendin')
She take that dick just like morphine

[Pre-Chorus]
I gotta leave her alone, she ain't right
I gotta leave her alone, she ain't right
Sippin' on Sprite, put her to night-night
Rockin' that ice in the club, that's a night light
I just might skeet in that bitch if it's too tight
No cap, I pop PB's like Mickey D's
I just get stuck, that pussy on seven seas
I gotta stop, these bitches don't love me

[Chorus]
These bitches don't love me, no, ha
These bitches don't love me, no, ha
These bitches don't love me, hell no
Up in Magic, I'm Elon Musk
They know I got bags, trust
Try to rob me, all you see is the gun dust
Crib real big like a campus

[Pre-Chorus]
I gotta leave her alone, she ain't right
I gotta leave her alone, she ain't right
Sippin' on Sprite, put her to night-night
Rockin' that ice in the club, that's a night light
I just might skeet in that bitch if it's too tight
(ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney)
No cap, I pop PB's like Mickey D's
I just get stuck, that pussy on seven seas
I gotta stop, these bitches don't love me

[Chorus]
These bitches don't love me, no, ha
These bitches don't love me, no, ha
These bitches don't love me, hell no—

[Verse 1]
Cut me down the middle
Fucked me up a little
You said I was your queen
I tried to give you everything
And now you want your freedom
You got just what you came for
A bit of fame and fortune
Now I'm no longer needed

[Pre-Chorus]
You said it was over, wanted it to end
Then you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends
You had a few secrets I was never told
Now everyone's talking and I'm the last to know

[Chorus]
Now I'm in the middle of Heartbreak City (Heartbreak City)
'Cause I'm in the middle of a world not pretty (World not pretty)
Your clever game got the best of me (Best of me)
But you ain't gonna get the rest of me (Rest of Me)
'Cause I'm in Heartbreak City

[Verse 2]
Tore me into pieces
Didn't have no damn reason
I let you in my house
You held yourself to everything
And left me with your mess
I curse the day we met
Your memory is haunting me
I wish I could forget

[Pre-Chorus]
You said it was over, wanted it to end
Then you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends
You had a few secrets I was never told
Now everyone's talking and I'm the last to know

[Chorus]
I'm in the middle of Heartbreak City (Heartbreak City)
Now I'm in the middle of a world not pretty (World not pretty)
Your clever game got the best of me (Best of me)
But you ain't gonna get the rest of me (Rest of Me)
'Cause I'm in Heartbreak City
And it's not that pretty

[Outro]
(Heartbreak City)

[Intro]
Hey Mr. DJ, put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby
And when the music starts, I never wanna stop
It's gonna drive me crazy
Uh-uh-uh!
Music (Music, music, music, music, music, music, music, music)

[Chorus]
Music, makes the people come together, yeah
Music, mix the bourgeoisie and the rebel

[Verse 1]
Hey Mr. DJ, put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby
And when the music starts, I never wanna stop
It's gonna drive me crazy

[Chorus]
Music, makes the people come together, yeah
Music, mix the bourgeoisie and the rebel

[Verse]
Don't think of yesterday and I don't look at the clock
I like to boogie-woogie (Uh-uh!)
It's like ridin' on the wind and it never goes away
Touches everything I'm in, got to have it every day

[Chorus]
Music, makes the people come together, yeah
Music, mix the bourgeoisie and the rebel

[Interlude]
Hey, Mr. DJ

[Refrain 2]
Do you like to?
Boogie-woogie, do you like to?
Boogie-woogie, do you like to?
Boogie-woogie, do you like my acid rock?
(Get stupid, get stupid) Do you like to?
Boogie-woogie, do you like to? (Get stupid, get stupid)
Boogie-woogie, do you like to? (Get stupid, get stupid)
Boogie-woogie, do you like my acid rock? (Get stupid, get stupid)

[Outro]
(Punch that man in the nose, he tried to molest me!)
(Ah, it was wonderful, I loved it)
(Uh-uh-uh)

[Verse 1]
I lived my life like a masochist
Hearing my father say
"Told you so, told you so
Why can't you be like the other girls?"
I said, "Oh no, that's not me
And I don't think that it'll ever be"
Thought I belonged to a different tribe
Walking alone, never satisfied, satisfied
Tried to fit in, but it wasn't me
I said, "Oh no, I want more
That's not what I'm looking for"

[Chorus]
So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness, somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth of my rebel heart

[Verse 2]
I spent some time as a narcissist
Hearing the others say
"Look at you, look at you!"
Trying to be so provocative
I said, "Oh yeah, that was me"
All the things I did just to be seen
Outgrown my past and I've shed my skin
Letting it go and I'll start again, start again
Never look back, it's a waste of time
I said, "Oh yeah, this is me
And I'm right here where I wanna be"
I said, "Fuck yeah, this is me
Right where I'm supposed to be"

[Chorus]
So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness, somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth of my rebel heart
So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness, somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth of my rebel heart

[Outro]
Of my rebel heart

[Intro]
Nobody fucks with the Queen!

[Verse 1]
I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was until I found you
I was beat, incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue, but you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel shiny and new (Hey!)

[Chorus]
(Like a virgin)
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats next to mine

[Verse 2]
Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you, 'cause only love can last
You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah you make me bold
Ccause your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out what was scared and cold

[Chorus]
Like a virgin (Hey!)
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

[Breakdown]
I know you want me
I could bring you so much pleasure
Just close your eyes
See my booty get down like (Uh)
See my booty get down like (Come on, uh)
See my booty get down like (Lower, uh)
See my booty get down like (Little lower, baby, uh)
See my booty get down like (Uh)
See my booty get down like (Come on, uh)
See my booty get down like (Lower, uh)
See my booty get down like (Little lower, baby, uh)
Huh, get down
Huh-uh, (Uh) get down (Come on, uh)
Huh-uh, (Uh) get down (Come on, uh)
Huh-uh, (Uh) get down (Come on, uh)
(Hey!)

[Chorus]
Touched for the very first time
(Come on, let me hear you sing!)
(Like a virgin)
With your heartbeat next to mine

[Outro]
Like a virgin
Ooh-ooh, like a virgin
(Let me hear you!)
Feels so good inside
When you hold me, and your heart beats, and you love me
Oh-ooh oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh baby (Yeah)
Can't you hear my heart beat for the very first time?

[Verse 1]
So long ago
Certain place
Certain time
You touched my hand
On the way
On the way down to Emmeline

[Pre-Chorus]
But if our paths never cross
Well, you know I'm sorry, but

[Chorus]
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
The rainbow's edge
(Aaron)
(Aaron)

[Verse 2]
So it's hard to find
Someone with that kind of intensity
You touched my hand, I played it cool
And you reached out your hand to me

[Pre-Chorus]
But if our paths never cross
Well, no, I'm not sorry, but

[Chorus]
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
The rainbow's edge
(Aaron)
(Aaron)

[Verse 3]
So long ago
It's a certain time
It's a certain place
You touched my hand and you smiled
All the way back you held out your hand

[Bridge]
If I hope and if I pray
Ooh, it might work out someday

[Chorus]
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's edge
I'll never live to match the beauty again
If I live to see the seven wonders (If I live to see the seven wonders)
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end (I'll make a path there)
I'll never live to match the beauty again (I'll never live to see that beauty, that beauty, that same, same beauty again)

If I live to see the seven wonders (If I live to see them)
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
(Well, if I hope and I pray)
(Well, maybe it might work out someday)

If I live to see the seven wonders (If I live to see the seven wonders)
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end (I'll make a path way there)
I'll never live to match the beauty again (Woah, I'll never live to match that beauty, that beauty)
(Same beauty over again)

[Outro]
If I hope and I pray
If I hope and I pray
Well, that there, baby, it might just work some way

If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's edge
Woah, and I'll never find that beauty
And I like you, my friend
Oh, the rainbow's edge
Listen to the wind on the water
Listen to the waves upon the shore
Try to sleep, sleep won't come
Just as I begin to fade

Then I remember
When the moon was full and bright
I would take you in the darkness
And do the tango in the night
Tango...

I keep the dream in my pocket
Never let it fade away
Inside, outside
No loneliness in this dream

Then I remember
When the moon was full and bright
I would take you in the darkness
And do the tango in the night
Tango...
I've been waitin'
For you to call
And I've been wonderin'
If I might fall

We had a special kind of love
We had a special kind of love

We should have never
Let it slip away
Let's drink a toast now
To the glory days

We had a special kind of love
We had a special kind of love

We had a special kind of love
We had a special kind of love
We had a special kind of love
It was way too hard... it was way too tough...
On this she had not bargained
But she was like some missionary dancing to the beat of some
Man's ancient drum
And she tries hard to tell this story... but it's a hard one to tell
She consults her book of Miracles...
Cry... and the wind says fly on
Well now you're on your own
You're back out on the road again for a million reasons
Well you're back out on the road again
And you try to tie together some connections...
You get some ribbons and some bows and get back out on the road again

So you found a queen without a king
Oh yes, and everyone here loved her... no one was wrong
But you're a little bit like her
You're just a little bit like her
A little bit like her... a little bit like Juliet

Turn to the blue crystal mirror... well as always it is truthful
Oh, well you see it in the reflection of the real blue lamp
Well tie the connection... get some ribbons and some bows... get back
Out on the road
But when they were good... they were really good... really good stranger
So you found a queen without a king
Oh yes, and everyone here loved her... no one was wrong
You're a little bit like her
You're just a little bit like her
A little bit like her... a little bit like Juliet

Let the crisis become a bridge... and cross that bridge tomorrow
Well let the time that goes between, baby...
Well let it let go of the sorrow
She says "The sky is crying." He says "No, the sky is blue."
He says "The sky is not crying," he says "The sky is blue."
She says "The sky is crying." He says "The sky is blue."
Can you get into that?
"The sky is crying... " He says "No, the sky is blue... "
(Ooh my love...)

In the shadow of the castle walls
Wherever those walls were
Well you used to love...to be behind...those walls with her
Within these walls...
Well he watched from the corridor...
Watched from the corner of his eyes...
Seemingly waiting for the time...
When the castle walls...would all fall down

Yes it was a strain on her...
Watching her castles fall down
Oh...but there was a time when...he called her "angel"
Where in the world did you come from?

In the shadow of the castle walls
Wherever those walls were
In this land or in that land
Well the castles all seem to belong to her
And all this talk...about love and hate
And our separation way on down the line...
Well they just can't wait, can they?
No they just can't wait...
Yes it was a strain on her...
Watching her castles fall down
Oh...but there was a time when...he called her "angel"
Where in the world did you come from?
Yes it was a strain on her
Watching her castles fall down
Oh...but there was a time when...he called her "angel"
Where in the world did you come from?

There was a light that lighted the way to the chamber...
Where they spent all their time, well...
There was a light that lighted the way to the chamber door where...
They seemed to spend all their time...

Ooh my love...Ooh my love...Ooh my love...

Yes it was a strain on her...
Watching her castles fall down
Oh...but there was a time when...he called her "angel"
Where in the world did you come from?
Yes it was a strain on her...
Watching her castles fall down
Oh...but there was a time when...he called her "angel"
Where in the world did you come from?
Yeah it was a strain on her...
Watching her castles fall down
Hey, hey, baby...No one can take you away from me...no...no one...
In the shadow of the castle walls...

[Verse 1: Christine McVie]
Can you hear me calling
Out your name?
You know that I've fallen
And I don't know what to say
I'll speak a little louder
I'll even shout
You know that I'm proud
And I can't get the words out

[Chorus]
Oh whoa, I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh whoa, I wanna be with you everywhere
(Wanna be with you everywhere)

[Verse 2]
Something's happening
Happening to me
My friends say I'm acting peculiarly
Come along, baby

You better make it soon
Before you break my heart

[Verse 1]
Can I be honest?
Can I be honest? Yeah
If I had one wish, I would wish I never said what I said that day
I was feeling myself, but I guess I got a little carried away
No, I ain't too proud, no, not right now
I ain't too proud to beg

[Pre-Chorus]
Seeing you with someone else makes me crazy
I need help, so, oh baby
'Cause I hate it (I hate it)
I can't take it (Can't take it)
And I'll change my mind, I want you

[Chorus]
Oh baby, I want you
Oh darling

Now I, changed my mind
Now I, changed my mind
I know what I said but I, I want you

[Verse 2]
Can I be honest?
Can I speak honestly?
'Cause it tears me up, baby
When I see you with a girl and the girl ain't me
And I get so mad 'cause this ain't how it had to be
No, I ain't too proud, no, not right now
I ain't too proud to beg

[Pre-Chorus]
Seeing you with someone else makes me crazy
I need help, so oh baby

Yes, I'm jealous, baby
Don't need to wonder

Don't want my man with some chick
I'm not afraid to admit
That I thought about it
But I changed my mind, I want you

[Chorus]

Hey, hey, hey, I want you
Nobody but you, boy
I said nobody but you, boy

I don't care about no one else
All I want is you to myself
See, I know that I'm selfish
Because I wanna love you
All to myself, all by myself
Let me hold you, let me love you
Oh no, I guess you're the man
Baby, let me love you down
Can I be honest? Can I be honest?
Can I be honest? Can I be honest?
Honest, honest, honest

[Verse 1]
I don't mind wasting my time
On you ’cause I really wanna spend my life with you
(Too busy looking in the mirror)
Yeah yeah
(Too busy looking in the mirror)
And right now, I'm not even on your mind
It's getting so bad I can see the signs
(It’s clear, now it's only getting clearler)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you can never get lost in us
You were too lost in yourself
(Too lost in yourself)
Oh, you keep asking me just what I want
Baby, you know all too well

[Verse 2]
Don't wanna do away with all my past
’Cause my heart is still attached
(Heart is still attached)
Yeah
(Heart is still attached)
Don't wanna cut my losses, boy, with you
But, I know this one fact
(I know this one fact)
Oh

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
My mama told me go on and let you go
Said you would be more problems than I'd ever know
Said if he's gonna go then let him go away

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
But then I get the urge, it hurts so bad (damn)
When I feel the thirst, it makes me mad
I look up in my bed
I look up and there is your face

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Pharrell Williams]
You love it, you love it
I'm so hooked on it (hooked on it)
You want it, you want it
You're so good on a good day
Sugarfall, your sugarfall
You make my sugarfall (sugarfall)
You know you want it bad, babe (Hey girl)

[Verse 3: Britney Spears]
I heard it in the streets you got another girl
Yes, it did sting
But didn't shatter my world (I'm ok)
You should catch me now
When I'm in a vulnerable state

[Verse 4: Britney Spears]
You're probably thinking to yourself
This just ain't me
But on the contrary, I was your freak (I was your freak)
Hit me one more time
And trust me I'll be ok
Hey

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Pharrell Williams]
You love it, you love it
I'm so hooked on it (hooked on it)
You want it, you want it
You're so good on a good day
Sugarfall, your sugarfall
You make my sugarfall (sugarfall)
You know you want it bad, babe (Hey girl)

[Bridge: Britney Spears]
Now I will be a bad chick if I rounded up my clothes
And headed over straight to the door
You wouldn't have a clue of what you should do
If I left you laying longing for more
You'd be like baby don't go (don't go)
Baby, want some more? (You want some more?)
Baby don't go (just don't go)
Said baby please listen
Don't you just go

[Verse 5: Britney Spears]
Why do you lick your lips, Mister Stand-Alone?
You ain't got no x-ray vision, staring through my clothes
Are you sure that you're prepared
For what comes serves on its plate?

[Verse 6: Britney Spears]
Wait a minute
Oooh, I'm having second thoughts
See my hearts on fault
Could you pass my shorts?
Don't you got a girl?
Till then, I'm sorry, you must wait
Especially since I know

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Pharrell Williams]
You love it, you love it
I'm so hooked on it (hooked on it)
You want it, you want it
You're so good on a good day
Sugarfall, your sugarfall
You make my sugarfall (sugarfall)
You know you want it bad, babe (Hey girl)
I'm so hooked on it (hooked on it)
You want it, you want it
You're so good on a good day
Sugarfall, your sugarfall
You make my sugarfall (sugarfall)
You know you want it bad, babe (Hey girl)

[Outro: Britney Spears]
You know you want it
So come and get it

[Spoke Intro]
I realize that it wasn't just for me
You know its for every woman
For every moher, woman, daughter
And for every man who can recognize a superwoman
So this song, i gota sing it
And everytime i think of it, i think of that
Mmm

[Verse 1]
Everywhere I'm turning, nothing seems complete
I stand up and I'm searching for the better part of me
I hang my head from sorrow, slave to humanity
I wear it on my shoulders, gotta find strength in me

[Chorus]
'Cause I am a Superwoman
Yes I am (Yes she is)
Still, when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an "S" on my chest
Oh, yes, I'm a Superwoman

[Verse 2]
(See this is for)
For all the mothers fighting
For better days to come
And all my women, all my women sitting here trying
To come home before the sun
And all my sisters coming together
Say "yes, I will," and "yes, I can"

[Chorus]
Cause I am a Superwoman
Yes I am (Yes she is)
Even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an "S" on my chest
Oh yes, I'm a Superwoman
Yeah

[Bridge]
When I'm breaking down and I can't be found
And I start to get weak
'Cause no one knows me underneath these clothes
But I can fly
We can fly, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause I am Superwoman
Yes I am (Yes she is)
Still when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an "S" on my chest
Oh yes, I'm a Superwoman
Oh let me tell you I am Superwoman, yes I am
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an "S" on my chest
Oh yes, I'm Superwoman (Yes I am)
Said I'm a Superwoman (Yes you are)

Oh, what's the vibe?
I wouldn't know, I
I'm normally in bed at this time (Bed at this time)
You guys, go do your thing
And I'll just leave at nine
Don't wanna bore you with my frail state of mind
"Oh, winner, winner, that's your biggest lie
I'm sure that you're fine"
I haven't told a lie in quite some time (Quite some time)
"You know we'll leave if you keep lying
Don't lie behind your (Frail state of mind)"

[Outro]

Baby, look what you doing
You got every man you pass by trying to holla at you
Baby, you ain't even choosing
And that's just what I like about you, you're interesting
I want to be your next contestant

[Pre-Chorus]

'Cause I know it takes much more
Than what's your sign or damn you're fine
Look like you havin a good time, baby

Wondering what it would have been like if I'da said it ain't a thang
But first I gotta know your name
She said I gotta play the game (the game)

[Chorus]
If I wanna be the next contestant (contestant)
She can point me in the right direction
Now she got me so interested (got me so interested)
Guess I gotta play the game
If I wanna be the next contestant (next contestant)
Ooh baby, I'ma come on down

Baby, you're a star tonight 'cause you got a smile that's so incredible
Plus you doing everything I like
And lady, you know I'm your type

Look like you having a good time, baby
(I'm not gon' let you leave me standing here)
Wondering what it would have been like if I'da said it ain't a thang
But first I gotta know your name
She said I gotta play the game (the game)

[Chorus]
If I wanna be the next contestant (contestant)
She can point me in the right direction
Now she got me so interested (got me so interested)
Guess I gotta play the game
If I wanna be the next contestant (next contestant)
Ooh baby, I'ma come on down

[Bridge]
(It's my turn at the wheel to spin
And I know you looking at me wondering what's my bid, baby)
I was thinking we could chop it up and later on we can run away, yea-yeah
(So interested, who will she pick, I gotta be the one to win)
But in order to get her name and let the info exchange
She said I gotta play the game

[Chorus]
If I wanna be the next contestant (contestant)
She can point me in the right direction
Now she got me so interested (got me so interested)
Guess I gotta play the game
If I wanna be the next contestant (next contestant)
Ooh baby, I'ma come on down
The sun is gonna keep on shining
Brighter days on the horizon
My love for you will keep on rising
Everything's gonna be alright

The sun is gonna keep on shining
Brighter days on the horizon
My love for you will keep on rising
Everything's gonna be alright

Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
She won't ask for reasons why
You won't need to write
But baby can tell
And she'll break your shell
Take your time

All I want is a seat on the curb
Where I can watch you get perfect

Nothing falls apart
Nothing falls apart
Nothing falls apart
Nothing falls apart
Nothing falls apart
Nothing falls apart

You said you feel way too used
And way too used to it
Yeah, the shit they gave you was too strong
Made you think too much
Save this dream just for me
And I'll be your baby

Nothing falls apart
Nothing falls apart
Nothing falls apart
Nothing falls apart
Nothing falls apart
Nothing falls apart
Nothing falls apart
Nothing falls apart
Nothing falls apart
Nothing falls apart
I remember the eyes
Of the kid in the crowd
Who cut me down to size
Realizing is crying out loud
For every kid on stage
There's a kid in the crowd

[Verse 1: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
Never been better, I guess that's a lie
'Cause your boyfriend is cool and I'm way too high
One last grasp for normalcy, but I guess, that's just not me

[Chorus: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
I sleep with my Cellphone next to my head
I guess that's the closest you'll ever be to my bed
I sleep with my Cellphone next to my head
I guess that's the closest you'll ever be to my bed

[Verse 2: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
Couldn't do better, I'm sure I'll do worse
My brain has become, kind of a curse
I can bend the truth, but not straight up lie
I wish I could, I don't know why

[Chorus: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
I sleep with my Cellphone next to my head
I guess that's the closest you'll ever be to my bed
I sleep with my Cellphone next to my head
I guess that's the closest you'll ever be to my bed

[Verse 1: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
My personality and other things I lack
A constant reminder that I'm not good enough for you
Or anyone else
I'm getting bored of jacking off
So I'll read a book or pretend I am
Mikhail Baryshnikov

[Chorus: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
Run through everything I said at least two times
As I try to fall asleep but can't unwind
I take self esteem to a whole new low
In my double bed, thinking I'll do better next time I know

[Verse 2: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
Another night of thinking I will make it through this year, if it kills me
With The Mountain Goats on repeat
You tell me you've been drinking
You tell me that you're drunk
I've got so many questions
I don't know what you want
But I know just what I want

[Chorus: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
Run through everything I said at least two times
As I try to fall asleep but can't unwind
I take self esteem to a whole new low
In my double bed, thinking I'll do better next time I know

[Verse 1: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
I'm on my phone too much
Pretending to text when I'm right beside, everyone I know
Let's go out, and interact with real life but I don't want to go

[Chorus: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
I don't do anything, anymore
I don't even go outside
I have no reason to be alive
And my world keeps getting smaller all the time
Is this it?
Is this it?
I want to know
Where'd all the time go?

[Verse 2: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
Netflix is all I need
Full house replaced my family
I only go outside when I know there's no one else around

[Chorus: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
I don't do anything, anymore
I don't even go outside
I have no reason to be alive
And my world keeps getting smaller all the time
Is this it?
Is this it?
I want to know
Where'd all the time go?

[Verse: Rowan Webster-Shaw]
There's this thing, that you do
And I don't know if you knew
But I was staring straight at you
Whenever I could

Talking 'til about 3am
Then waiting till I can do it again
Just you wait till I figure out
What I want to say to you
And this time I'll actually
Fucking follow through

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I couldn't utter my love when it counted
Ah, but I'm singing like a bird about it now
I couldn't whisper when you needed it shouted
Ah, but I'm singing like a bird about it now

[Chorus 1]
Words hung above, but never would form
Like a cry at the final breath that is drawn
Remember me, love when I'm reborn
As a shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn

[Verse 2]
I'd no idea on what ground I was founded
All of that goodness is going with you now
Then when met you, my virtues uncounted
All of my goodness is going with you now

[Chorus 2]
Dragging along, following your form
Hung like the pelt of some prey you had worn
Remember me love, when I'm reborn
As a shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn

[Verse 3]
I fled to the city with so much discounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now
Back to the hedgerows where bodies are mounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now

[Chorus 3]
I was housed by your warmth
But I was transformed
By your grounded and giving
And darkening scorn
Remember me love, when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn

[Verse 1]
She don't believe that I could love her
She just don't see my eyes are for her
Only one way to know
Somewhere she won't go

[Chorus]
Well, I think that I could love her
I think that I could love her

[Verse 2]
Meeting her eyes with mine tells me
All that I need is tough
Do she believe that I love her
Could I love her?

[Chorus]
Well, I think that I could love her
Love her
I think that I could love her
Love her
Love her

[Verse 1]
Ain't no way for me to love you
If you won't let me
It ain't no way for me to give you all you need
If you won't let me give all of me

I know that a woman's duty
Is to help and love a man
And that's the way it was planned
Oh, but how can I, how can I, how can I
Give you all the things I can
If you're tying both of my hands?

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, it ain't no way
(Ain't no way)
It ain't no way
(Ain't no way)
It just ain't no way, baby
(Ain't no way)
Ain't no way, baby
(Ain't no way)
It ain't no way for me to love you
If you won't let me

[Bridge]
Stop trying to be someone you're not
How cold and cruel is a man
Who paid too much for what he got?
And if you need me like you say, say you do
Oh, then please, please
Please don't you know that I need you?

[Chorus]
Oh, it ain't no way
I tell you that it ain't no way
It ain't no way, it ain't no way, baby, no
It just ain't no way
It sure ain't no way
It ain't no way for me to love you
If you won't let me

[Outro]
No way
If you won't let me
Ain't no way

[Chorus]
All my worst nights are the best times
West Coast stealin' all my shut-eye
All my worst nights are the good kind
High life filtered through the lo-fi

[Verse 1]
Startin’ it up after dark
Chasin' thoughts, cruisin' through Echo Park
Joined the vultures eatin’ paradise
Gettin' tilted, yeah, we'll pay the price (But ain't it nice?)

[Pre-Chorus]
Never say, "Goodbye", we say, "Hello"
Faded in the sunshine and the snow

[Chorus]
All my worst nights are the best times
West Coast stealin' all my shut-eye
All my worst nights are the good kind
High life filtered through the lo-fi

[Break]

[Verse 2]
Skippin' lines and brushin' past the suits
Duckin' pictures and droppin’ some truths
Now I’m gettin' lost up in the Hills
But cruise the ’Gram and now I'm catchin' feels
Is this for real?

[Pre-Chorus]
Never say, "Goodbye", we say, "Hello"
Faded in the sunshine and the snow

[Chorus]
All my worst nights are the best times
West Coast stealin' all my shut-eye
All my worst nights are the good kind
High life filtered through the lo-fi

[Break]

[Bridge]
Yeah, you know
It’s only in L.A
Yeah, uh huh
(La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)
Only in L.A
(La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)

[Chorus]
All my worst nights are the best times
West Coast stealin' all my shut-eye
All my worst nights are the good kind
High life filtered through the lo-fi

[Outro]
(Lo-fi, lo-fi)
Yeah, uh huh
Highs filtered through the low
You know, woo
High life filtered through the lo-fi

[Verse 1]
I came to sleep
Under the sea
But water pressure
Always gets the best of me

[Verse 2]
I swam back up
Opened my eyes
Couldn't tell the difference
Between the water and the sky

[Verse 1]
I came to sleep
Under the sea
But water pressure
Always gets the best of me

Evil Knievel
I ain't really finna tell y’all how to get away with murder and shit

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
They told me stop buying all these fancy cars
They told me, "Please take all your diamonds off"
I'm gettin' too rich to fly commercial flights
They wanna lock me up like Suge Knight
I know that bitch want me to go for that (But I don’t wanna)
But I'm too rich to put my dick in that (Bitch, I'm not goin')
I hit that bitch way back, I gave her back ('Cause I don't want her)
They love my drip, you know I'm statin' facts (I’m not goin’)

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
I'm a CEO, I keep it cordial with an artist, I just don’t politic
These women been giving me compliments
Focused, I can't acknowledge this
Astonishment, ugh
Look at how the game transformed overnight
Felt like I was just gettin' read my rights
Look at how the ice hittin' under them lights
Married to the game, we ain’t throwin' no rice
All-gray sweats with the white G-Nikes
Ain't too much changed, got too much change
Come to think about it, I was lookin' at life
Stack, invest, nigga don't just rap
Talkin' 'bout dap, nigga can't do that
Fetch me the keys, I mean remote
Car got a button, I'm 'bout to float
I'm organized, it's lookin' organized
'Cause the front the house looks like a parking lot
Take off the shirt, check out the work
Body scribbled like a Marks-a-Lot
Bandana Louis, no vest, and a fully
Buyin' dogs, I'm investin' in bullies
I came from that, I perfected my juggin'
Diamond teeth, got a watch full of boogers
Got a chef, vegetarian cookin'
Cameraman, get professional footage

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
They told me stop buying all these fancy cars (But I don't wanna)
They told me, "Please take all your diamonds off" (But I'm not goin')
I'm gettin' too rich to fly commercial flights ('Cause I don't wanna)
They wanna lock me up like Suge Knight (But I'm not goin')
I know that bitch want me to go for that (But I don't wanna)

I hit that bitch way back, I gave her back ('Cause I don't want her)
They love my drip, you know I'm statin' facts (I'm not goin')

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
The world's most hate-able, currently unavailable
Solo roof, I'm hater-proof, pull up, watch what the haters do
Gucci's antisocial, bipolar, he's unrelatable
Heard he wrote a novel, got labels, but you can't label him
Independent labels, they model him and they study him
Hood rich lingo, he model, but he not stuntin' them
Northern people come 'round me, flex, start talkin' Southern now
Movin' like the governor, fuck it, bitch, I'm the governor
I'm the new Puffy, fuck it, the new 50
I'm the new Baby (Bling), fuck it, the new Jimmy
Big rock frigid (Yeah), fuckin' up hoes' vision
Coupe, no ceilin', ceilin' has gone missing

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
They told me stop buying all these fancy cars (But I don't wanna)
They told me, "Please take all your diamonds off" (But I'm not goin')

Think I'm gettin' good 'cause I'm peepin' nationalities
My bitch changed her wig then she switched her personality (Wop)

[Chorus]
Protect yourself at all times, that's on God (God)
I don't do songs with my opps, that's on God (Fuck 'em)
I don't shake hand with my opps, that's on God (Pussy)

Sing to her like I'm Bryson Tiller (Bryson Tiller)
Pass it low up on the pain tho
I'm the master bae, I'm Percy Miller
Pop a perky, baby, painkiller
Project baby, yeah, my pain realer
Fifty deep inside the nosebleed
Big flooded out my thang really
Saint Laurent want a hashtag
Fuck around and get a body bag
Fuck around and get a milkshake
Fuck around and get a lot of bags
I tear up the sidewalk, I tear up the asphalt
I'm riding on the skywalk, same color as the asphalt
I got a new black chopper, same color as the asphalt
My diamonds they bad, yo', same color as the asphalt

[Pre-Chorus]
Bae, hey, late, late, late, late, late
You so late, late, late, late, late (you late, you so late)
I'm so paid, paid, paid, paid, paid
Big ol' racks, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
I got a new foreign, I got a new foreign
I got a new bae, damn, I got a new broad
I got a new barbie, I got a new bitch (new bitch)
I got a new headache (new head), I'm on my new shit

[Post-Chorus]
Take a look up to the moon, you'll see a real nigga gettin' it (real nigga gettin' it)
Take a look up to the moon, you'll see a real nigga in it (real nigg in it)
I want you to take pics that are of your life and you see nigga living
You'll see a nigga living, aye
Bomb-bomb, she the bomb-bomb, I see lil' momma drip
You Kowabunga off a tightrope in the jungle, yeah
You played the guitar at a night show, I might come and listen
Shawty the highlight, she got a good vibe, make life worth livin'

[Verse 1]
Don't mind me I'm only sitting here
Dreaming something up seems so unclear
Only thing that's getting in the way of getting paid
And everybody knowing my name
Isn't that I wish I wasn't me
Even though I do occasionally
Wouldn't change except this little thing
See what it brings
Can't help thinking of how it could be

[Chorus]
Oh, if I only could sing like Mariah
Oh, if I only could sing like Mariah does
Oh, if I only could sing like Mariah
Oh, if I only could sing like Mariah does

[Verse 2]
Everything around so glamorous
See the spotlight shining down on us
Tinted windows for some privacy, nothing to see
Still have feelings hopefully
Not so sure that I could even cope
Bottle service and a velvet red rope
Wouldn't need a thing, but suddenly it would be free
Can't help thinking of how it could be

[Chorus]
Oh, if I only could sing like Mariah
Oh, if I only could sing like Mariah does
Oh, if I only could sing like Mariah does

[Outro]
Anyway, that's it, never mind

[Chorus:]

I just float around, no gravity
Talk sweet shit, got a cavity
These hoes call me your magisty
I done killed your bitch, it's a tragity
Brick Squad's my fakelty
I'm a multimillionaire actually
Didn't get it overnight though, stacked my paper up gradually
I got these haters mad at me
Tell the truth I'm mad at me
All the time I done lost, all the millions I done lost
Going hard is my plan A
I ain't really got no plan B
Dirty mouth from the dirty south, so they say it's hard to understand me
My closet look like Lenox mall
I got more kicks than Jet Lee
Brooce Lee and Jacky Chan, and Chuck Noris and Mr. T
I see dope for the 

[?]
Got that Kush strong, I need a zip for it
I'm a 

[?] with TZ
Got that good Lean, I need a sip of it

[Chorus:]
I'm feeling kind of sick, I need to see the doctor
With my homie 

[?] that's my drinking partner
Lying in the car with a couple choppers
With my homie Mo Joe, that's my smoking partner
I'm higher than a cloud, I don't wanna be bothered
With my partner Waka, that's my rolling partner
Call my nigga Wooh, that's my gambling partner
I'm higher than a cloud, I don't wanna be bothered

[Verse 2:]
Higher than a cloud, I don't wanna be bothered
Leaving from the club, I don't wanna be folloed
That's your girl, oh that's your wife, well tell your girl that I wanna be swalloed
Popped 2 pills, my nigga I'm rollin
I can't ly, I don't wanna be chosen
All these hoes and all this ice
And all this shit, my nigga I'm frozen
All this cash done got me limpin
If I wasn't rapping, I'd be pimping
If a nigga was to take my main bitch
I can't even ly, I wouldn't be trippin
Pull your girl, now I got her strippin
Break up with you, now she got you tippin

[?] but I'm still not slippin
Middle finger up to

Selling dope, that's my dessision
When I go to prison

When you talk, them hoes don't listen

[Verse 1]
I'm hurting baby, I'm broken down
I need your loving, loving I need it now
When I'm without you, I'm something weak
You got me begging, begging I'm on my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I need you
Like the sky needs blue
One of three me too for sure
And when I feel like I lost my way
Baby, just one taste of cure

[Chorus]
Sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Baby, show me good loving, make me alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?

[Verse 2]
My broken pieces, you pick them up
Don't leave me hanging, hanging
Come give me some
When I'm without you, there ain't no sun
There's only one thing, one thing I'm thinking of

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I need you
Like the sky needs blue

[?] free me too for sure
When I feel like I lost my way
Baby, just one taste of cure

[Chorus]
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Baby, show me good loving, make me alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?

[Bridge]
I want that red velvet
I want that sugar sweet
Don't let nobody touch it unless that somebody's me
You say you got a man, I gotta find the way
You 'bout to make me go back to my Carolina days

[?]
First take trophy in 

[?] too
I still got that 

[?] too

[?] too
Making all that serious
When you go, I'm furious
You ain't on that shy shit
No makeup on, that's my sugar

[Chorus]
Sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Show me good loving, make me alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?

[Verse 1]
Spending this time up
Things are alright
Here I am outside
Sun is too bright
I can sort that out
Hiding my eyes
Sorry for you, though
Just tryin' to find my line of sight

[Chorus]
Another thing, 'nother thing
'Nother thing'll never come true
Another thing, 'nother thing
'Nother thing'll never come true
Another thing, 'nother thing
'Nother thing'll never come true
Another thing, 'nother thing
'Nother thing'll never come true

[Verse 2]
Dripped along softly
Never pressed hard
I got no calice
I got no yard
Would it need water?
Will anyone mind?
Walk me up sooner
I'll hold you 'til the end of time

[Chorus]
Another thing, 'nother thing
'Nother thing'll never come true
Another thing, 'nother thing
'Nother thing'll never come true
Another thing, 'nother thing
'Nother thing'll never come true
Another thing, 'nother thing
'Nother thing'll never come true

[Verse 1]
Everyone I know
Lives in my cellphone
No matter where I go
Moving along, so

[Chorus]
I should probably put this down
I don't need a thing right now
Tell me that I'm not allowed
Pull me out this goddamn crowd
Find us something else to do
Anything, just me and you
Anything at all

[Verse 2]
I got these dollars
Shirt got no color
Don't own no Prada
Shouldn't have bothered

[Chorus]
I should probably put this down
I don't need a thing right now
Tell me that I'm not allowed
Pull me out this goddamn crowd
Find us something else to do
Anything, just me and you
Anything at all

[Verse 1]
I was sitting like i do
Doing something slow
Mentioned that she's headed out
To meet people that we know
Maybe I should come along
Maybe I should stay
I could wear my newest pair
Maybe we could have a date

[Chorus]
Nothing could be better
Better than you
Oh, nothing could be better
Better than you
Oh, nothing could be better
Better than you
Oh, nothing could be better
Better than you

[Verse 2]
Sliding through the alleyway
Get a thing to drink
Looking in each other’s eyes
Hope I never have to blink
Skip out on the social call
Busy holding hands
Got me smiling finally
Got no reason to be sad

[Chorus]
Nothing could be better
Better than you
Oh, nothing could be better
Better than you
Oh, nothing could be better
Better than you
Oh, nothing could be better
Better than you

[Verse 1]
Walk a little different these days
Seems like things are going my way I guess
Still could stand to talk a little less
Maybe it's the pain in my chest
Book is by the side of my bed
Probably read my phone instead of it
Stubborn like I’d never admit
Showing up alone like this

[Chorus]
I don't need anything
Anything other than
Touch of my angel's hand
Whenever she can lend

[Verse 2]
Tryna do a little bit more
Is it gonna work out? Well sure it is
Any everything ya insist
Talk it like I never miss
Chewing on my fingers again
Habit isn’t leaving no end to it
Landed on my head and it split
No one's laying low like this

[Chorus]
I don't need anything
Anything other than
Touch of my angel's hand
Whenever she can lend

[Verse 1]
Dressed up like I'm going out, I feel it and I turn
Empty out my pockets for a tab to soften up the burn
So I walk in little circles rung around just like a bell
Maybe I could feel better with some people that I know so well

[Chorus]
Let me be here all night long
Let me be
Let me be here all night long
Just another night outside
Let me be here all night long
Turn another light off
Let me be
Let me be here all

[Verse 2]
Larry's saying something, Keith is living on a smile
Salu's quiet in the middle, holding on and feeling tired
Well I guess it's been a while, we could probably go home
And I know that she'll be fast asleep and I'll be all alone (Oh well)

[Chorus]
Let me be here all night long
Let me be
Let me be here all night long
Just another night outside
Let me be here all night long
Turn another light off
Let me be
Let me be here all

[Verse 1]
Guess it's been a few days now
Since I left the house
Should be out about
Quiet as a mouse is
I need something medium
Voice goes high like helium does (Helium)
Don’t know what you see in them
Anyway, I'll be around here pretty much the whole day or so

[Chorus]
I could have sworn it was a Sunday, but I still don't wanna
I can’t remember any damn things, I'm just like my oma

[Verse 2]
I just got a brand new pair
From I don't know where
Got me outta there
Stitch already tearing
I should switch up everything
I don't feel like anything else
Not sure how to deal with it
Maybe I can figure it out, give me just a quick second or two

[Chorus]
I could have sworn it was a Sunday, but I still don't wanna
I can't remember any damn things, I'm just like my oma
I could have sworn it was a Sunday, but I still don't wanna
I can’t remember any damn things

[Outro]
I’m just like my, ah ah
I'm just like my
I’m just like my, ah ah
I'm just like my
I'm just like my, ah ah
I'm just like my
I’m just like my, ah ah
I'm just like my oma

[Verse]
If I gotta be
Awake at night
Can I skip the heat?
A couple lights
That'll let me see
Anything that, I might need
Roll it up a bit
But keep it light
Got my little kit
I do alright
Well I wonder if
Anything that, lets me sleep
Is gonna make its way to me
It's still 4 o'clock in the morning
And I still don't feel like I can put my head back down

[Skit]
Breathe in
Breathe in
That's better
Now close your eyes
Yeah
Breathe in
Close your eyes
Breathe in
Close your eyes
Fall asleep, fall asleep, fall asleep, fall asleep
Fall asleep, fall asleep, fall asleep

[Verse 1]
Who doesn't know what I’m talking about
Who's never left home, who's never struck out
To find a dream and a life of their own
A place in the clouds, a foundation of stone

[Verse 2]
Many precede and many will follow
A young girl’s dreams no longer hollow
It takes the shape of a place out west
But what it holds for her, she hasn't yet guessed

[Chorus]
She needs
Wide open spaces (spaces)
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs (new)
New faces
She knows the high stakes

[Verse 3]
She traveled this road as a child
Wide-eyed and grinning, she never tired
But now she won't be coming back with the rest
If these are life's lessons, she'll take this test

[Chorus]
She needs
Wide open spaces (spaces)
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs (new)
New faces
She knows the high stakes
She knows the high stakes

[Bridge]
Aahhh aahhh aahhh
Aahhh aahhh aahhh

[Verse 4]
As her folks drive away, her dad yells, "Check the oil"
Mom stares out the window and says, "I'm leaving my girl"
She said, "It didn't seem like that long ago"
When she stood there
And let her own folks know

[Chorus]
She needed
Wide open spaces (spaces)
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs (new)
New faces
She knows the high stakes
She knows the high stakes
She knows the highest stakes

[Outro]
(Wide open spaces)
She knows the highest stakes
She knows the highest stakes
(Wide open spaces)

[Verse 1]
I've been lookin' at you from across the room
'Bout time I got my nerve
Well you might tell me "Boy hell naw"
But hell what can it hurt?
'Cause I just wanna

[Chorus]
Spin you around, around this dance floor
Get you drunk on a love like mine
Might wind up and steal a couple kisses
Get your digits if I can find the right line
And you don't do feelin's, and baby if you're willin'
I'ma do my best to change your mind
'Cause the way you stole my heart without a sign
Girl it oughta be a crime

[Verse 2]
Got a pretty good feelin' I'm takin' you home
Gonna love you with all I got
But before we slip out into the night
I just want one more shot
To take your hand and

[Chorus]
Spin you around, around this dance floor
Get you drunk on a love like mine
Might wind up and steal a couple kisses
Get your digits if I can find the right line
And you don't do feelin's, and baby if you're willin'
I'ma do my best to change your mind
'Cause the way you stole my heart without a sign
Girl it oughta be a crime

[Bridge]
I fought in some bars, broken some laws
Ain't ever done nothin' this bad
Yeah, with one look at me you became my disease
They don't make no cure for that

[Chorus]
And I just wanna
Spin you around, around this dance floor
Get you drunk on a love like mine
Might wind up and steal a couple kisses
Get your digits if I can find the right line
And you don't do feelin's, and baby if you're willin'
I'ma do my best to change your mind
'Cause the way you stole my heart
Yeah, the way you stole my heart
Yeah, the way you stole my heart without a sign
Girl it oughta be a crime
I just wanna spin you around tonight
I just wanna spin you around tonight

[Verse 1]
I made my share of empty promises
Not like you care anymore
I wish you did, but I've done all I can do
Baby, I ain't gonna chase you out that door

[Verse 2]
If you don't know by now that you're the one I love
Clearly we were never meant to be
If you'll take the words out of someone else's mouth
Before you take mine, well I got nothin' left to say

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll stand alone
It won't be the first time, or the last time that I'm gonna make it on my own
Oh, I'll stand alone
Don't be sorry, don't call me, 'cause I won't pick up the phone
I'm standin' alone

[Verse 3]
Just the other day drivin' down the highway
Seen a Chevrolet reminded me of you
I almost called, but I'm sure glad I didn't
I just shook it off and drank some Mountain Dew
You always said that it was bad for my health
Well baby you can go to hell

[Chorus]
While I stand alone
It won't be the first time, or the last time that I'm gonna make it on my own
Oh, I'll stand alone
Don't be sorry, don't call me, 'cause I won't pick up the phone
I'm standin' alone

[Bridge]
The waves will crash, and the winds will blow
But I'll be standin' here on my tip toes

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll stand alone
It won't be the first time, or the last time that I'm gonna make it on my own
Oh, I'll stand alone
Don't be sorry, don't call me, 'cause I won't pick up the phone
I'm standin' alone
I'm standin' alone
I'm standin' alone
Standin' alone

[Intro]
Ahh yeah

[Verse 1]
There's some days that I wake up, can't remember where I am
Said some things, regret some things, but I really don't give a damn
Somewhere on this road I'm on I forgot what it's like to feel
I know I can't see heaven up there, but I know that it's real
And I ain't sure If I'll get in, but you best believe I'll try, yeah
And this is what my daddy told me, and this is how I live my life

[Chorus]
Got to take that ball cap off before you say grace
And always own up to your own mistakes
And don't you ever back down, no way no how
Got to make your daddy proud that he raised a man of the south
Yeah, that's what he did

[Verse 2]
I can't heal the broken hearts I left so far behind
On this road I have chose I lost all sense of time
So I drift into the night tryna drown away my sorrows
It might be wrong, but that's alright 'cause all the time is borrowed anyways

[Chorus]
Got to take that ball cap off before you say grace
And always own up to your own mistakes
And don't you ever back down, no way no how
Got to make your daddy proud that he raised a man of the south

[Bridge]
Some call me lost, some call me crazy
But that's okay
Think what you want, say what you will
But I've always kept it real
There's a cost for all these sins, and I'm bound to pay the price
Now this is what my daddy told me, and that's how I live my life

[Chorus]
Got to take that ball cap off, son, before you say grace
And always own up to your own mistakes
And don't you ever back down, no way no how
Got to make your daddy proud that he raised a man of the south
A man of the south
Ahh, take it away boys
Better take that ball cap off son

[Verse 1]
She's my yin yang girl, she’s day she's night
Just a shot in the dark, she's a beam of light
She’s a hot contradiction, a brand new addiction
Like to sip that wine when I take her out fishin'

[Verse 2]
She's the last one there when they close the bar
Got mud on the tires of her fancy car
She's a real good girl 'til she's had a few
Likes church on Sunday, sits in the back pew
If the preacher only knew that man

[Chorus]
She's an angel who can raise a little hell
A drive fast, high class southern belle
She's crazy there ain’t no doubt about it
She’s a rock star dancin' on the tailgate
A little bit a sinner, and a little bit a saint
My yin yang girl
Yeah, she’s an angel who can raise a little hell

[Verse 3]
She's a daddy's little girl, she can do no wrong
But I hope he never sees her camera phone
She's a real home maker, a whiskey shot taker
A bed time story and a midnight shaker
Shake it babe

[Chorus]
And man, she’s an angel who can raise a little hell
A drive fast, high class southern belle
She's crazy there ain't no doubt about it
She's a rock star dancin' on the tailgate
A little bit a sinner, and a little bit a saint
She's my yin yang girl
Yeah, she's an angel who can raise a little hell

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
She's an angel who can raise a little hell
A drive fast, high class southern belle
She's crazy there ain't no doubt about it
She's a rock star dancin' on the tailgate
A little bit a sinner, and a little bit a saint
She's my yin yang girl
Man, she's an angel who can raise a little hell
She's a rock star dancin' on the tailgate
A little bit of Skynyrd, and a little bit a Hank
She's crazy there ain't no doubt about it
She's crazy there ain't no doubt about it
She's my yin yang girl who can raise a little hell

[Outro]
Ahh, man
I think I got it bad for this one

[Verse 1: Brian]
What if I never run into you?
What if you never smiled at me?
What if I had noticed you too?
And you never showed up where I happened to be

[Pre-Chorus: Nick]
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
On a quiet night, what are the odds?
What's a guy like me doing in a place like this?
I could have just walked by, who would have thought?

[Chorus: Brian]
What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Like two in a million, like once in a life
I could have found you, put my arms around you
Like two in a million, like once in a life
What are the chances?

[Verse 2: AJ]
What if I hadn't asked for your name?
And time hadn't stopped when you said it to me? Oh
Of all of the plans that I could have made
Of all of the nights that I couldn't sleep, oh

[Pre-Chorus: AJ and Nick]
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
In a crowded room, what are the odds?
(What's a guy like me doing in a place like this?)
Getting close to you, but here we are

[Chorus: Nick]
What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Like two in a million, like once in a life
That I could have found you, put my arms around you
Like two in a million, like once in a life
What are the chances?

[Bridge: Howie and Kevin]
Is it love? Is it fate?
Who am I? Who's to say?
Don't know exactly what it means (Ooh, oh, yeah)
''Is it love? Is it fate?''
''Where it leads, who can say?''
''Maybe you and I were meant to be''

[Chorus: Nick and Brian]
What, what
What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Two in a million, once in a life
That I could have found you, put my arms around you (My arms around you)
Two in a million (It's like two in a million), once in a life, yeah (Woah)
What are the chances? (What are the chances?)
Two in a million, once in a life
What are the chances? (What are the chances?)
Two in a million, once in a life

[Outro: Brian]
What if I never run into you?
And what if you never smiled at me?

[Verse 1: Kane Brown]
Passed our exit five ago
Four lanes to county roads
Playlist lighting up the dark
808's and pounding hearts

[Pre-Chorus: Becky G & Both]
Won’t tell nobody where we're going
Just you and me and the headlights glowing
Girl don't you know you got the key to my heart
In my car, let’s go far

[Chorus: Kane Brown]
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Where there is no cares
Me and you out there all alone
Moonlight shining, county riding
Not one bar on our phones
Counting the white lines as they blur by
Till there's gravel on the ground
They won't find us if we don't wanna be found

[Post-Chorus: Kane Brown]
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Lost in the middle of nowhere

[Verse 2: Becky G]
Static building up in here
Where you take me, I don't care
The further we get, the closer we are
Blurring the lines under midnight stars

[Pre-Chorus: Becky G & Both]
Won't tell nobody where we're going
Just you and me and the headlights glowing
Yeah boy, I know you got the key to my heart
In your car, take me far

[Chorus: Kane Brown]
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Where there is no cares
Me and you out here all alone
Moonlight shining, county riding
Not one bar on our phones
Counting the white lines as they blur by
Till there's gravel on the ground
They won’t find us if we don’t wanna be found

[Post-Chorus: Kane Brown & Becky G]
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Lost in the middle of nowhere
(Lost in the middle of nowhere, yeah)

[Bridge: Kane Brown & Both]
We're young and the highway goes on forever
Come on girl, no time to waste, it’s now or never
We're young and the highway goes on forever
And ever and ever

[Chorus]
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Where there is no cares
Me and you out here all alone (Out here all alone)
Moonlight shining, county riding
Not one bar on our phones (Not one bar on our phones)
Counting the white lines as they blur by
Till there's gravel on the ground
They won't find us if we don’t wanna be found

[Post-Chorus]
Lost in the middle of nowhere (Nowhere)
(Lost in the middle of nowhere, yeah
Lost in the middle of nowhere)
Lost in the middle of nowhere

[Verse 1]
Well, we're here
We're at the common again
Smoked six of the ten fags that I only bought an hour ago
Said, "Well I, I like the look of your shoes
I like the way that your face looks when I'm arguing with you"
And so when, when we all grow old
I hope this song will remind you I'm not half as bad as what you've been told

[Chorus]
And when I knock at a hundred and two
And I see your pyjamas
I can't stop smiling at you

[Verse 2]
That's why we're here, we're at the common again
I've been pouring my heart out towards your optimistic grin
I said, 'Well I, I like the cut of your jib
I like the way that your face looks when you're yapping on about him"
But on this shirt I found your smell
I just sat there for ages contemplating what to do with myself

[Chorus]
I called you up at a hundred and two
We just sat there for ages
Talking about that boy what was getting on to you

[Verse: Anderson .Paak, Justin Credible & DJ SourMilk]
You never know 'til you finally go there
Momma told me dream big like my fo'head
My wig pushed back, ten racks to get repaired
Well I guess I'm fuckin' bitches in knitted caps again
Skipped the baggage claim, went straight to Rodeo
Fashion Week in Paris, never left the hotel
Braggin' on my swag, I rather let these hoes tell
And they wonder when I'll stop it, your guess is good as mine, man
Drip on faucet like I came from the Oscars
Tell Chris Stampd I need more winter time options
I came in and got love from the authors
You came in and got hit with foreign objects
Brick and wool on my noggin but I remember the time when
Back when ain't nobody love us, back when everybody fronted
We was prayin' for some bad weather, keep our pockets flooded
This is way before the hurricane but we could see it comin'
How much for a brick if I flip? Lately I been wonderin'
Go to hell or get a job? Fuck you niggas buggin'
I was meant to beat the odds, somethin' out of nothin'
You afraid to take a loss, I lost my older brother
Sister, father, auntie, cousin, I got nothin' left but y'all
Hockin' rubies from the jaw it's just another jewel bitch
Now I got the sauce, okay now I got the juice, hey, hey
I repped the 'Nard, even when you never knew it
My first release party, twelve niggas came through it
First I got a lawyer, moved momma to Georgia
Copped my sis a Honda, talk about spoiled
If I can't get radio I'm snatchin' up the products
Apple, Google, Amazon, Spoti-
Shouts out to Justin, shouts out to Sour
If I go commercial they gon' run me every hour (Every hour)
Okay, you gon' run me every hour? (Every hour)
Okay, you gon' run me every hour? (Facts)
First I had my heart broke, then I had my heart meant
Then I had a heart to heart with my conscious
Rest in peace to Mac, wish you was alive still
And if we get to meet I'ma roll you up some ganja
I'ma roll you up some ganja
I 'preciate it man, look
That XXL freestyle was kinda ass
So I couldn't hit the Leakers without spittin' straight gas
And I'm on a warpath and I brought my team back
Shout out to Aftermath, 12 Tone and Free Nash

[Verse 1]
Blue Boy, worried 'bout the world's eyes
Worried, every time the sun shines
Worried 'bout his haircut
Calm down, sweetheart, grow up

[Chorus]
Blue Boy

Blue Boy, older than the world knows
Honey, that's the way that life goes
No use acting so tough
Calm down, sweetheart, grow up

[Verse 1]
I told you about Strawberry Fields
Well, here's a place you know just as real
It’s just another place you can go
Everything glows
Looking through the bent backed tulips
To see how the other half lives
Looking through a glass onion

[Verse 2]
I told you about Strawberry Fields
Well, here's a place you know just as real
It's just another place you can go
Everything glows
Looking through the bent backed tulips

[Slurred] half lives

[Gibberish]
Looking through a glass onion

[Gibberish]

[Verse 3]
I told you about Strawberry Fields
Well, here’s a place you know just as real, ooh

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in

[Verse 2]
Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in

[Bridge]
In their sties with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking

[Whistling]

[Verse 3]
Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You will see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to cut their pork chops

[Chorus]
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival

[Verse 2]
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill and she called herself Lil
And everyone knew her as Nancy
She and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
Now, Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

[Instrumental bridge]

[Chorus]
Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival

[Outro]
...Two, three, four
One, two, three, four
Two, three, four, yeah

[Intro]
Hello, Paul! (Hello!)

Maybe you could turn the level of this mic down a little

[Verse 1]
Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you
Julia

[Chorus]
Julia, Julia, ocean child, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

[Bridge]
Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering
In the sun

[Chorus]
Julia, Julia, ocean child, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

[Outro]
When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia
Julia
Julia

[Whistling]
Okay

[Unintelligible] in the middle of her meditation course in Rishikesh, India. No one was to know that, s-s-sooner or later, she was to go completely berserk under the care of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. All the people around were very worried about the girl, because she was going insane, so we sang to her
Thank you

Lala how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!

With a couple of kids running in the yard

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mum
He's the all American bullet-headed saxon mother's son
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill

Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
The problems you sow are the troubles you're reaping
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Bridge 1]
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

[Verse 2]
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake, we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Bridge 2]
I don't know why you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

[Verse 3]
I look at the trouble and pain that is raging
While my guitar gently weeps
As I'm sitting here doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Outro]
Gently weeps
Still my guitar gently weeps

I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no
I'm so tired, I don't know what to do
I'm so tired, my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do

[Chorus]
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
And ya know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
(Woo!)

[Verse 2]
I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid git
No, no, no
I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink

You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane

When I hold you in your arms
When you show each one of your charms
I wonder, should I get up
And go to the funny farm
No, no, no

[Outro]
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm

For a little peace of mind (woo!)
I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind (woo!)
I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

In the morning want to die
In the evening want to die
If I ain't dead already

My mother was of the earth
My father was of the sky
But I am of the universe
And that's the reason why:

[Chorus]
I'm lonely want to die
Yes I'm lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already

The worm he eats my bones

If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

Even hate my rock and roll

This is the introduction to Ringo's "Don't Pass Me By"
Take 4

[Orchestra]

[Verse 1: Ringo]
I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door
I don't hear it
Does it mean you don't love me any more?

[Verse 2: Ringo]
I hear the clock a'ticking
On the mantle shelf
See the hands a'moving
But I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight
And why I'm by myself
I don't see you
Does it mean you don't love me any more?

[Chorus: Ringo]
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

[Verse 3: Ringo]
I'm sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said that you would be late
About an hour or two
I said that's alright I'm waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you

[Chorus: Ringo]
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

[Verse 1: Ringo]
I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door
I don't hear it
Does it mean you don't love me any more?

[Chorus: Ringo]
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

[Outro: Ringo]
I'm waiting for you, honey
Hurry up to me
I don't want you to pass me by
I don't want you to make me cry
I want you to make me happy
Happy, happy
'Cause that's what I want
This is so friendly
This is so friendly
This is so friendly

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

[Verse 2]
Black bird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

[Chorus]
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black, dark black, dark black night

[Outro; Spoken]
Do you wanna just keep a few that you think are worth it, y'know
See, if we're ever to reach it, I'll be able to tell you when I've just done it
I don't know, y'know
I should think- I should think so
Just needs forgetting about it (yeah)
Now it's a decision which voice to use, y'know
I think it's better quieter (I do, too)
Come along now
Put all those toys away
It's time to jump into bed
And go off into dreamland
Yes, Daddy will sing a song for you
Are you ready?
Now it's time to say good night
Now don't ask me why
Now the sun
Uh, oh dear, hold on
Daddy, daddy went a bit crazy
Daddy

Good night, take ten

Close your eyes and I’ll close mine
Good night, sleep tight

Just a smile would lighten everything
Sexy Sadie, the greatest of them all, ah

[Chorus 1]
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
(Yeah, maybe you have to give him his own mic)
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Verse 1]
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

[Chorus 2]
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Verse 2]
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

[Chorus 3]
I look from the wings at the play you are staging
While my guitar gently weeps
As I'm sitting here doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Intro]
What's that?
Camel sunshine
Hey, hey, he-he-he-hey!

[Verse 1]
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

[Verse 2]
Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better
Woah

[Bridge 1]
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Na

[Verse 3]
Hey Jude, don't let me down
She has found you, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better, better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin

And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder
Na na na na na na na na na

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better

Then you can start to make it better
Better, better, better, better, better, woah

[SPOKEN]

He was a fool unto himself

Rocky Raccoon
Rocky Raccoon
He was a fool unto himself
And he would not swallow his foolish pride
Mind you, coming from a little town in Minnesota
It was not the kind of thing that a young guy did
When a fellow went and stole his chick away from him

[SUNG]

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come, equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems, had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
And Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
Said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
The doctor walked in sminking of gin (laugh) 

[Sminking?]
And proceeded to lie on the table
He's really sminking of gin
And it did him in the end 

[Poor doc.]

Meantime back on the table, yeah
The doctor said, "Rock, you met your match, son"
Rocky said, "it's only a scratch, son
I'll be better soon"
"You better be, better soon," said the doc
Come on son, gotta get hip
Gotta get up
Gotta get back to your gun
Gotta go show that Danny Boy

However, Rocky Raccoon fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out and left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival

Da da da da...
That's the story of the Rocky Raccoon

[SPOKEN]
Now Rocky Racoon
Got up from his room and he walked out through the swing doors of the local saloon
Straight into the arms of someone new
Someone who he'd known from a long way back
Maybe from his primary school days
A young friend Rocky had recognized

[HALF-SPOKEN-HALF-SUNG]
He said, "honey, will you be my new honey-bunch"
She said "Rocky boy, come on, I'll show you why I love you."
"Young Rocky Racoon, I love the way you wear your hat
Love the way you hid your pants, Rocky Raccoon, I dig you"

He said, "missus, I dig you too, come with me"
(...By the OAC, didn't get to sleep last night)
(Doing good?)
Well, I've been doing wonderful on the last two takes
(Yes)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play
Dear Prudence, greet the brand new day
The sun is up, the sky is blue
It's beautiful and so are you
Dear Prudence won't you come out to play

[Verse 2]
Dear Prudence open up your eyes
Dear Prudence see the sunny skies
The wind is low the birds will sing
That you are part of everything
Dear Prudence won't you open up your eyes?

[Bridge]
Look around round
Look around round round
Look around

[Verse 3]
Dear Prudence let me see you smile
Dear Prudence like a little child
The clouds will be a daisy chain
So let me see you smile again
Dear Prudence won't you let me see you smile?

Dear Prudence, greet the brand new day

[Intro]
I'll just have cheese and lettuce and marmite sandwich... and coffee
Ok a-one, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Verse 2]
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

[Verse 3]
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 4]
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted

[Outro]
Yeah
Hold it, Harry (Sorry)
It's okay, I sang... tried to do a Smokey and I just aren't Smokey (Take ten)

[Intro]
Well, you don't know any dance steps that are new
And no one else could love you like I do, do, do, do, do

And you don't like crazy music
Don't like rocking bands
You just wanna go to a movie show
And sit there holding hands

[Chorus]
You're so square
Baby, I don't care

Baby, I don't care
Baby, I don't care
Baby, I don't care

Have extra on the first one, So it's like...
Well!
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, ooh
Helter Skelter take 17
One, two, three, four

[Bridge]
When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the hill
Where I stop and I turn and I give you a thrill
Then I get to the bottom and I see you again, yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Well, do you, don't you want me to love you
I'm coming down fast but I'm mile's above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

[Chorus]
Oh, look out
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Oh, helter Skelter
Woo

[Verse 2]
Well, will you, won't you want me to make you

Wasn't quite to get there in the first verse, I don't think
Ok
It still seems to speed up a bit on the...
Might be my imagination
A-one, two

[Verse 1]
I told you about Strawberry Fields
You know, the place where nothing is real
Well here's another place you can go
Where everything glows

[Chorus 1]
Looking through the bent back tulips
To see how the other half lives
Looking through a glass onion

[Verse 2]
I told you about the walrus and me
You know that we're as close as can be
Well here's another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul

[Chorus 2]
Standing on the cast iron shore, yeah
Trying to make a zens edge meet
Looking through a glass onion (yeah)

[Bridge]
Yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Looking through a glass onion

[Verse 3]
I told you about the fool on the hill
I tell you, man, he standing there still
Well, here's another place you can be
Listen to me

[Chorus 3]
Looking through a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dove-tail joint
Looking through a glass onion

[Outro]
How was that?

[Paul McCartney] Love you forever, and for- I hardly think so!

[George Martin?] What the hell's going on?!

[John Lennon?] Well you know, gentlemen, I mean..!

[Paul McCartney] It verges from the sublime to the ridiculode!

(Well - 1, 2, 3)

[Verse 1]
Who knows how long I've loved you?
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime?
If you want me to, I will

[Verse 2]
For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same

[Bridge]
Love you forever, and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart

[Verse 3]
And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be to near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Oh, you know, I will, I will

Da-da-da da-da
La-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da

You know that it's true (Rattle them skulls)
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Not a love of my own

Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a love in my heart
Without a dream in my own

And then I suddenly 

[appeared] before me
The only one I ever wanted to hold
And then you said you'd come and then you'd adore me
Blue moon, you went to turn into gold

Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone-- hahahaha

[Unintelligible]
One, two, three

Who knows how long I've loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime?
If you want me to, I won't

Yes, you will
Step inside love and stay
Step inside love
Step inside love
Step inside love
I want you to stay

You look tired love
Let me turn down the light
Come in out of the cold
Rest your head
On my shoulder
And kiss me goodnight

We are together
Now and forever
Come my way
Step inside love
And stay
Step inside love
Step inside love
Step inside love
I want you to stay
Do-do-do-do, do-da-da-n'da-da

Do-n'do-do-do-do, oh yeah
Well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
Man in the crowd with the multicolored mirrors on his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy working overtime
Soap impression of his wife which he ate and donated to the National Trust

I need a fix cause' I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown

[Verse 1]
It's been a long, long, long time
How could I ever have lost you
When I loved you

[Verse 2]
It took a long, long, long time
Now I'm so happy I found you
How I love you

[Bridge]
So many years I was searching
So many tears I was wasting, oh oh

Gathering, gesturing, glimmering, glittering
Happening, hovering, humouring, hammering
Lacquering, lecturing, labouring, lumbering
Mirroring

[Outro]
Alright, ol' lads, sock it to me
One more time

It's just that there's all them to choose from, then
One, two, three

I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no

[Verse 2]
I'm so tired, I don't know what to do
I'm so tired, my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do

[Chorus]
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

[Verse 3]
I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh, he was such a stupid git

[Chorus]
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane!

For a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind

If you think it was good, keep it
If you don't, scrap it

Hello?
Hello, hello?

It's okay. Just a.. just a little lower, just so I can see
It's all those changes, amazing changes

Take two
One, two, three, four

[Chorus]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

[Verse 1]
He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents, he always took his mom
He's the all American, bullet-headed, saxon mother's son

[Chorus]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
Was it a thrill, Bungalow Bill?

[Verse 2]
Deep in the jungle, where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes

[Chorus]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

[Verse 3]
The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce," his mummy butted in
"If looks could kill, it would have been us instead of him"

[Chorus]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
Was it a thrill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

[Outro]
Hey!
Bungalow, bungalow, bungalow Bill
Can you pass that ash tray? Take three

What do you think of all that? Do you think I can do it better?
I think I can do it a bit better
Oh yeah?
Ok see, I want to just try and do one quiet verse, one loud verse, and then that's it really

[Verse 1]
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
No one will be watching us
Why don't we do it in the road?

[Verse 2]
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

[Verse 2]
Black bird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

[Chorus]
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in

[Verse 2]
Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in

[Bridge]
In their sties with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking

[Verse 3]
Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon

[Outro]
One more time

[Verse 1]

Sexy Sadie oooh you broke the rules

One sunny day the world was waiting for a lover (Sadie)
She came along to turn on everyone
Sexy Sadie the greatest of them all

[Verse 4]
Sexy Sadie how did you know
The world was waiting just for you
The world was waiting just for you
Sexy Sadie oooh how did you know?

[Verse 5]
Sexy Sadie you'll get yours yet
However big you think you are
However big you think you are
Sexy Sadie oooh you’ll get yours yet

[Verse 6]
We gave her everything we owned just to sit at her table
Just a smile would lighten everything
Sexy Sadie she's the latest and the greatest of them all

[Outro]
She made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie

However big you think you are
Sexy Sadie

[Incomprehensible]

Come and keep your comrade warm

You don't know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R

Looking through the bent backed tulips
To see how the other half lives

Looking through a glass onion

I told you about the walrus and me, man

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

[Verse 1]
He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mum
He's the all American bullet-headed saxon mother's son
All the children sing

[Chorus]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

[Verse 2]
Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes
All the children sing

[Chorus]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

[Verse 3]
The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce", his mummy butted in
"If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him"
All the children sing

[Chorus]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill

Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill

[Verse 1]
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Verse 2]
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

[Verse 3]
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Verse 4]
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

[Verse 5]
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, ooh

[Verse 1]
She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do, oh yeah
She's well-acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust

[Verse 2]
I need a fix because I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix because I'm going down

[Verse 3]
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun

[Chorus]
Happiness (is a warm gun)
Bang, bang, shoot, shoot
Happiness (is a warm gun, momma)
Bang, bang, shoot, shoot

[Verse 4]
When I hold you in my arms
And when I feel my finger on your trigger
I know nobody can do me no harm
Because:

[Chorus]
Happiness is a warm gun momma
Happiness is a warm gun, yes it is
Happiness is a warm, yes it is, gun
Well don't you know that happiness is a warm gun momma?

[Chorus 1]
Martha my dear
Though I spend my days in conversation
Please, remember me
Martha my love
Don't forget me
Martha my dear

[Chorus 2]
Hold your head up you silly girl
Look what you've done!
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl

[Verse]
Take a good look around you
Take a good look, you're bound to see
That you and me were meant to be for each other
Silly girl

[Chorus 2]
Hold your hand out you silly girl
See what you've done!
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl

[Chorus 1]
Martha my dear
You have always been my inspiration
Please, be good to me
Martha my love
Don't forget me Martha my dear

[Verse 1]
I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no
I'm so tired, I don't know what to do
I'm so tired, my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do

[Chorus]
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

[Verse 2]
I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid git

[Chorus]
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind

[Muttered by John] 

[Outro]
Monsieur, monsieur, monsieur, how about another one?

[Verse 1]
Now somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, "I’m gonna get that boy"
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

[Hook]
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival

[Verse 2]
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 3]
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I’ll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"

[Hook]
Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival

[Outro]
C'mon Rocky boy
C'mon Rocky boy

[Verse 1]
I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door
I don't hear it
Does it mean you don't love me any more

[Verse 2]
I hear the clock a'ticking
On the mantle shelf
See the hands a'moving
But I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight
And why I'm by myself
I don't see you
Does it mean you don't love me any more

[Chorus]
Don't pass me by don't make me cry don't make me blue
Because you know darling I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said that you would be late
About an hour or two
I said that's alright I'm waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you

[Chorus]
Don't pass me by don't make me cry don't make me blue
Because you know darling I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

[Chorus]
Don't pass me by don't make me cry don't make me blue
Because you know darling I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

[Verse 1]
Who knows how long I've loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me to, I will

[Verse 2]
For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same

[Chorus]
Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart

[Verse 3]
And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Oh, you know, I will
I will

[Verse 1]
Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you
Julia

[Verse 2]
Julia, Julia, ocean child, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

[Verse 3]
Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hum hum hum...calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia

[Hook]
You say it's your birthday
It’s my birthday too, yeah
They say it's your birthday
We're going to have a good time
I’m glad it's your birthday
Happy birthday to you

Yes we're going to a party party
Yes we're going to a party party
Yes we're going to a party party

[Chorus x2]
I would like you to dance (Birthday)
Take a cha-cha-cha-chance (Birthday)
I would like you to dance (Birthday)
Dance

You say it's your birthday
Well it's my birthday too, yeah
You say it's your birthday
We’re going to have a good time
I’m glad it's your birthday
Happy birthday to you

[Chorus]
Yes I'm lonely want to die
Yes I’m lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

[Verse 1]
In the morning want to die
In the evening want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it’s worth

[Chorus]
Yes I'm lonely want to die
Yes I'm lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

[Verse 2]
The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bones
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones

[Chorus]
Yes I'm lonely want to die
Yes I'm lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

[Verse 3]
Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll

[Chorus]
Yes I’m lonely want to die
Yes I’m lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

[Verse 1]
Born a poor young country boy, Mother Nature's son
All day long I'm sitting singing songs for everyone

[Verse 2]
Sit beside a mountain stream, see her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies

[Verse 3]
Find me in my field of grass, Mother Nature's son
Swaying daisies sing a lazy song beneath the sun

[Outro]
Mother Nature's son
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on is such a joy, come on it's such a joy
Come on and take it easy, come on and take it easy, take it easy, take it easy
Everybody’s got something to hide, except for me and my monkey

Hah, the deeper you go, the higher you fly, the higher you fly, the deeper you go
So come on, come on, come on it's such a joy, come on is such a joy
Come on and make it easy, come on and make it easy, take it easy, take it easy
Everybody's got something to hide, except for me and my monkey

Your inside is out, and your outside is in
Your outside is in, and you inside is out
So come on, ha, come on, ha, come on is such a joy
Come on it’s such a joy, come on and make it easy, come on and make it easy
Take it easy, take it easy
Everybody's got something to hide except for me and my monkey

Come on, come on, come on, come on

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
When I get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and turn
And I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Do you, don't you want me to love you?
I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on tell me the answer!
Well you may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

[Hook]
Go Helter Skelter

Yeah, yeah

Well do you, don't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me your answer

[Ringo]
I got blisters on my fingers!

[Verse 1]
It's been a long long long time
How could I ever have lost you
When I loved you

[Verse 2]
It took a long long long time
Now I’m so happy I found you
How I love you

So many tears I was searching
So many tears I was wasting, oh

[Verse 3]
Now I can see you, be you
How can I ever misplace you
How I want you
Oh I love you
You know that I need you
Oh I love you

[Intro: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Take two
Okay

[Verse 1]
You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all wanna change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all wanna change the world

[Pre-Chorus]
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out, in

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right

[Verse 2]
You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're all doing what we can

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
Well, all I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
You know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right

[Verse 3]
You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We'd all love to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free your mind instead

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao
You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow

Don't you know it's gonna be all right
You know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right

All, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all right, all right

She was a working girl
North of England way
Now she's hit the big time
In the USA
And if she could only hear me
This is what I'd say

[Chorus]
Honey pie you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home

[Verse 2]
Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee
Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong

Honey pie come back to me, oh

Yeah
I like it like that, oh ah
I like this kind of hot kind of music
Hot kind of music
Play it to me, play it to me, Hollywood blues

Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me?

[Chorus]
Honey pie you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home

[Outro]
Oooooooooooh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Honey pie, honey pie

[Chorus 1]
Creme tangerine and Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news

[Chorus 2]
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

[Verse 2]
Cool cherry cream and a nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge really blows down those blues

[Chorus 2]
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

[Verse 3]
You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through
You're going to know and how
The sweat is going to fill your head
When it becomes too much
You're going to shout aloud

[Chorus 2]
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

[Verse 4]
You know that what you eat you are
But what is sweet now, turns so sour
We all know Ob-La-Di-Bla-Da
But can you show me, where you are?

[Chorus 1]
Creme tangerine and Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news

[Chorus 2]
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

Yes, you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

[Intro]
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better

[Verse 1]
The king of Marigold was in the kitchen
Cooking breakfast for the queen
The queen was in the parlour
Playing piano for the children of the king

[Chorus]
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

[Verse 2]
The king was in the garden
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The queen was in the playroom
Painting pictures for the children's holiday

[Chorus]
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

[Verse 3]
The duchess of Kircaldy always smiling
And arriving late for tea
The duke was having problems
With a message at the local Bird and Bee

[Chorus]
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

[Verse 4]
At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table
For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark

[Chorus]
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

[Outro ]
Can you take me back where I came from
Can you take me back
Can you take me back where I came from
Brother, can you take me back
Can you take me back
Mm, can you take where I came from
Can you take me back

[Chorus]
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number

[Verse 1]
Then there's this Welsh Rarebit wearing some brown underpants
About the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Everyone of them knew that as time went by
They'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower but
It's all the same thing, in this case manufactured by someone who's always
Umpteen your father's giving it diddly-i-dee
District was leaving, intended to pay for

[Chorus]
Number 9, number 9

Who's to know?
Who was to know?

[Chorus]
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9

[Verse 2]
I sustained nothing worse than
Also for example
Whatever you're doing
A business deal falls through
I informed him on the third night
When fortune gives

[Chorus]

Right! Right!
Right, right, right, right!
Right!
Right!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I've missed all of that
It makes me a few days late
Compared with, like, wow!
And weird stuff like that
Taking our sides sometimes
Floral bark
Rouge doctors have brought this specimen
I have nobody's short-cuts, aha

[Chorus]

With the situation

They are standing still

The plan, the telegram

Ooh ooh

[Chorus]

Ooh

[Verse 4]
A man without terrors from beard to false
As the headmaster reported to me
My son he really can try as they do to find function
Tell what he was saying, and his voice was low and his hive high
And his eyes were low

Alright!

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
So the wife called me and we'd better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So I said I'd marry, join the bloody navy and went to sea

In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I'm not in the mood for whirling

Um da
Aaah

[Verse 6]
How?
Dogs for dogging, hands for clapping
Birds for birding and fish for fishing
Them for themming and when for whimming

Only to find the night-watchman
Unaware of his presence in the building

Onion soup

[Chorus]

Industrial output
Financial imbalance

Thrusting it between his shoulder blades

The Watusi
The Twist

El dorado

Take this brother, may it serve you well

Maybe it's nothing
Aaah
Maybe it's nothing
What? What? Oh

[Verse 7]
Maybe even then
Impervious in London
Could be difficult thing
It's quick like rush for peace is
Because it's so much
It was like being naked

If you became naked

[Verse]
Now it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you

[Chorus]
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you

Mmmmmm
Mmmmmm
Mmmmmmmmmm

[Chorus]
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you

[Outro]
Good night, good night, everybody
Everybody everywhere
Good night

[Chorus: SZA]
If I had a soldier (had a soldier)
I'd send him to war (I'd send him to war)
And if he returns to me (returns)

[?]
If I had an army
I could rule this place
If I had an army
You won't hurt my fate

[Rap]

[Chorus: SZA]
If I had a soldier (had a soldier)
I'd send him to war (I'd send him to war)
And if he returns to me (returns)

[?]
If I had an army
I could rule this place
If I had an army
You won't hurt my fate
When I was in the 3rd grade
I thought that I was gay
Cause I could draw, my uncle was
And I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, "Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K!"
Tripping, yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math, like
"Yeah, I'm good at little league"
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition, playing God
Ahh, nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And "God loves all his children" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
If I was gay I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
"Man, that's gay" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're saying
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots
Behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate
Yet our genre still ignores it
"Gay" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on! And be yourself!
When I was in church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That Holy Water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same but that's not important
No freedom til we're equal
Damn right I support it
I don't know
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
We press play, don't press pause
Progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking around the hallway
Plagued by pain in their heart
A world so hateful
Some would rather die
Than be who they are
And a certificate on paper
Isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us
We have to change us
Whatever god you believe in
We come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath, it's all the same love
About time that we raised up!
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
Love is patient, love is kind
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Actin' like they killers, but them niggas just some hoes
We act like this a studio, this really just a trap
Everything we got, we had to whip it out the bowl
Before we shake your hand, we'd rather slap you with the strap
A million cash in hunnids, now they bring it to the door (Racks)
20k for a coat that I ain't even wore
This bitch so bad, I let her shop, I made 'em close the store
She think she trickin' me, but bitch don't know my pockets swole (The money)
Big bankroll, top floor South Beach (Top)
Long money Gucci, ask your bitch 'bout me (Ask)
Penthouse suite, four hoes, two weeks
And all my shooters shootin; .223's 'bout me, Wop

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]

Boy you been a ho since Arsenio
Fuck your bitch, put her in the figure four

Silencer make the bullets tippy-toe

'Cause I always knew that a better day come
Haven't been asleep, seven day run
Never knew how a Chevrolet run
Ice Cube, Eazy-E, Ren, and Dre
I am the new NWA
Nigga with a AK-47

All these ho niggas must be Hochella

(There's some whores in this house, there's some whores in this house)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
No bullshit, my nigga
I'm pushin' my triggers
They lookin' for niggas in bushes, my nigga
In the ocean, in the lake, in the woods, in the rivers
The skies was gray and the bullets was silver
Young Money on front of my hoodie, my nigga
You front on your money, you couldn’t, my nigga
We kill you by breakfast and cook you for dinner
The lesbians say you a pussy-ass nigga, ol' ho-ass nigga
I put some pressure on your ho
Make her tell me what she know
Stop confessin' to that ho
Stop confidin' in that ho
Stop providin' for that ho
You gon' die for that ho
Suicide for that ho

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
If you saw me, would you understand
That I can't stand you with another man?
I see you happy where your life is at
I see you smile, I can't live with that

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
'Cause what about me? Yeah
I stayed up all night for you
Girl, girl, what about me? Yeah
I shut down my life for you
Now you runnin' 'round with him, and him, and him
How you do that?
How you act like I never held you every night?
And now you never call back, please
Girl, girl, what about me?

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Oh, tell me, do you ever think about it?
Those lonely nights when you 'bout lost it (Oh)
The only time that you would call
Was just to tell me it's my fault (Oh)
I let you cry, I let you worry
I let you yell, I let you hurt me (Oh)
I gave you everything you need
And now you gone, gone, gone
Tell me, how you do that to me? Yeah

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Girl, what about me? Yeah
I stayed up all night for you (Yeah)
Girl, girl, what about me? Yeah (Girl, what about me?)

Girl, girl, what about me?

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
Oh, girl, girl, girl, what about me? Me?

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
I ain't never been the one to let it go (Let it go)
Never thought I'd see you leave me in the cold
Every time that you got mad
You would leave and come right back
Always bringing up the past
Guess you couldn't handle that
Where you at when you're not with me?
You ignoring my calls
Look how quick you forgot 'bout me
I'm waiting (I'm waiting, I'm waiting)

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Post Malone]
Girl, what about me? Yeah (Girl, what about me?) (Oh)
I stayed up all night for you (I stayed up all night) (Oh)
Girl, girl, what about me? (What about me, girl? Yeah, what about me, girl?)
I shut down my life for you (I shut down my life)
Now you runnin' 'round with him, and him, and him
How you do that? (How, girl?)
How you act like I never held you every night?
And now you never call back, please (Please)
Girl, girl, what about me? Me? (Yeah, what about me?)
Oh-ho-oh

[Verse 1]
There's a fire burning in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch that's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out, I'll lay your shit to bare
See me leaving with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire burning in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch that's bringing me out the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
They keep me thinking

[Chorus]
We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat

[Verse 2]
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you're looking for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

[Pre-Chorus]
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
They keep me thinking

[Chorus]
We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it to the beat

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat

[Intro]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, woah
Ayy, ayy, ayy, woah
Mhm

[Verse]
And everything is all cool, until I say it's a go
They talking all the shit, they said that I would not reach my goals
I kept on going for sho’, but they don't know it, I know
She said she wasn't with the shits, I told her to stay in the cold, ayy
I ain’t got the time to paint the sign for you, ayy
But it's okay, don't wanna fight with you, ayy
Put a couple thousand on the side for you, ayy
Hop up in the 'Rari, take a ride with you
Shit was jumping, I grabbed the shotty
I swung my door fully open and then I close it
Then lead the party, bitch, it coming, it keep on coming
And I ain't post it, but I show it
I let you know it, and now I own it, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember when I had a dream I pull up in the 6?
Remember when they said Young Posty wasn't gon' be shit?
Remember I was starving, hungry? Ain't no way to live
Shit, everything is different now

[Chorus]
When I step up on stage, this shit go up
Yeah, I blow a bitch brain when we show up
Yeah, bitch the whole squad on the glow up
I remember we was nothin’, now they know us
Seem like every damn night that we pour up
All these bands right now, I’ma blow 'em
Yeah, bitch the whole squad on the glow up
I remember we was nothin’, now they know us, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember when I had a dream I pull up in the 6?
Remember when they said Young Posty wasn't gon' be shit?
Remember I was starving, hungry? Ain't no way to live
Shit, everything is different now

[Chorus]
When I step up on stage, this shit go up
Yeah, I blow a bitch brain when we show up
Yeah, bitch the whole squad on the glow up
I remember we was nothin’, now they know us
Seem like every damn night that we pour up
All these bands right now, I'ma blow 'em
Yeah, bitch the whole squad on the glow up
I remember we was nothin', now they know us, yeah

[Outro]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, woah
Ayy, ayy, ayy, woah
Mhm

[Verse 1]
When I was a hitchhiker on the road
I had to count on you
But you needed me to ease the load
And for conversation too
Or did you just drive on through?

[Verse 2]
You didn't see me in Toronto
When I first tried out some hash
I smoked through a pen and I'll do it again
If I only had some cash
If I only had some cash, ooh

[Verse 3]
Then I tried amphetamine
And my head was in a glass
Taped underneath the speedometer wires
Of my '48 Buick's dash
But I knew that wouldn't last

[Verse 4]
Then came California
Where I first saw open water
In the land of opportunity
I knew I was getting hotter
I knew I was getting hotter

[Verse 5]
But the neon light and the endless night
They took me by surprise
The doctor gave me valium
But I still couldn't close my eyes
I still couldn't close my eyes

[Verse 6]
Then came paranoia
And it ran away with me
I couldn't sign my autograph
Or appear on TV
Or see or be seen

[Bridge]
Living in the country
Sounded good to me
Smoking grass with my Chicago lass
In a real organic scene
Where everything was green

[Harmonica Break]

[Verse 7]
We had a kid and we split apart
Now I'm living on the road
And a little cocaine goes a long, long way
To ease that different load
But that ain't all that I know

[Verse 8]
I wish I was an Aztec
Or a runner in Peru
I would build such beautiful buildings
To house the chosen few
Like an Inca from Peru

[Intro]
(It's time)
(Yeah)
(Time)
(Yeah)

[Verse]
Grandma told me that you’re sowing the seed
I care about gold when I tell you, believe me
I went all the way home when I came to see you
I make you wanna bone when I seem to be on my
Youngest killer, kid got game
I left home never looked back in the same
I'm at the stage where I turn into a star
I'm coming for the big yards that won’t get stardom like
I'm 25 and I just made it from the bottom
I never brag but it's hard thing, I never lie
My niggas stay quiet they ain't seen no lie
Me and kid no lie in this thing no lie you know
I already told you the city don't love now
Never much shame when I seem to ball but how'd I
Go from Mod Clubs to an arena
And go to arena and tell em' give me the beat I'm like
I got game
That typa nigga game
I throw you niggas out and I’m fuckin’ bitches no shame
Imma wife her then i make her the baddest in the game
Its insane bumpin'
Zine in a Mulsanne
Im like, uh, you know the way
Wasn’t gonna be the same
Wasn't born into the rich life like you
You fazed I ain't
Tellin' lies when you get me to stay
Would’ve been all funny when you get no lane, ahhh
I just wanna take a little time
I just wanna wait, you say it
I just wanna make you love
I just wanna make it so
Say it love, It's the only way to make it stop
Give it a little time
I just wanna, yeah

[Outro]
XO special
High Klassified is sick
Say it, say it, say it, say it
Maybe I should

[Verse 1]
Like words in a book but they don't have an ending
Standing impatient, all the walls are spinning
Rush to a plane to find it's been delayed
Guess I'll hurry up and wait

Stuck in the sands, still looking for an ocean
Rain on my face, but ain't no cloud today
Down on my knees to pray, it turns to hoping
So desperate in the worst way

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Guess I´ll hurry up and wait
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Guess I´ll hurry up and wait
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Wish time wasn't on my side
Oh, guess I´ll hurry up and wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

[Verse 2]
Like words in a book but they don't have an ending
Standing impatient, all the walls are spinning
Rush to a plane to find it's been delayed
Guess I'll hurry up and wait

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Guess I´ll hurry up and wait
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Guess I´ll hurry up and wait
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, guess I´ll hurry up and wait
Yeah, yeah
Hurry up and wait
Ooh-ooh
Wish time wasn't on my side, oh
Wish time wasn't on my side
Guess I'll hurry up and wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

[Verse 1]
Different people have their different ways of living
I chose mine and it was unforgiving
Someone gave me guidance, there was something in it
I put it into practice and I tried to live it
I'm self-dividing and I have no limit
I can't fix it, it's not right
Nothing feels good, it's not right

[Chorus]
Watching my world
Make funny faces at its own reflection
(Nothing feels good, it's not right)
So I'll follow my girl
'Til I find myself a sense of direction
(Nothing feels good, it's not right)

[Verse 2]
I found a subsidence but I overlooked it
Someone gave me guidance and for once I took it
I put it in perspective and I see so clearly
I'm part of a collective, oh I nearly reached it
In the distance, caught the light
I can fix it, make it right

[Chorus]
Watching my world
Make funny faces at its own reflection
(Nothing feels good, it's not right)
So I'll follow my girl
'Til I find myself a sense of direction
(Nothing feels good, it's not right)
Watching my world
Make funny faces at its own reflection
So I'll follow my girl
'Til I find myself a sense of direction

[Bridge]
Nothing feels good, I can't fix it, it’s not right
Right
Nothing feels good, I can't fix it, it’s not right
Right

[Chorus]
Watching my world
Make funny faces at its own reflection
(Nothing feels good, it's not right)
So I'll follow my girl
'Til I find myself a sense of direction
(Nothing feels good, it's not right)
(Run for your life)
I took the cookies, put em to the side
Sunny day, but I'm cooking inside
Muddy path, but I'm taking my time

I need cash money, baby we live
I remember they ain't save me a slot
Back up when niggas hit the jackpot
I got sense, I'm tryna' get me some guap
I need the tint
Just like my daddy skin - dark
I see your nigga, too bad he a mark
I see real niggas just jab, they don't bark
I see you tryna' rekindle the spark
Reelin' from loss
Inner remorse, your voice just spirit and corpse
I tell y'all I'm hearing it all
The wisdom that's in your remarks
The silliness in you, I mourn
The moments that's tender and soft
I'm in em', the memories got strong
Some of them lost
The silliness in you, I mourn
The moments that's tender and soft
I'm in em', the memories got strong
But some of them long gone
(Run for your life)
I took the cookies put em to the side
Sunny day but I'm cooking inside
Muddy path but I'm taking my time

(Run for your life)
I took the cookies put em to the side
Sunny day but I'm cooking inside
Muddy path but I'm taking my-

[Verse]
Run for your life, I took the cookies put em to the side
Sunny day but I'm cooking inside
Muddy path but I'm taking my time
I need cash money baby we live
I remember they ain't save me a slot
Back up when niggas hit the jackpot
I got sense I'm tryna get me some guap
I need the tint
Just like my daddy skin dark
I see your nigga too bad he a mark
I see real niggas just jab they don't bark
I see you tryna rekindle the spark
Runnin' from loss
In a remorse
Your voice just mirroring corpse
I tell y'all I'm hearing it all
The wisdom that's in your remarks
The silliness in you I mourn
The moments that's tender and soft i'm in 'em
The memories got strong
Some of them lost
The silliness in you I mourn
The moments that's tender and soft I'm in 'em
The memories got strong
But some of them long gone
Run for your life, I took the cookies put em to the side
Sunny day but I'm cooking inside
Muddy path but I'm taking my time
Run for your-
Run for your life, I took the cookies put em to the side

Muddy path but I'm taking my-

[Verse 1]
I wasted all my time
Waiting for the stars
To align
To intertwine

[Pre-Chorus]
And now you're taking up all of my time
Wherever you are: I'm with you from afar

[Chorus]
She makes me wonder why
She makes me wonder what I'm doing
Spending all these seconds away from her
The time I'm losing
Being far away, I'm lost in space
Make it go away, all this space between us

[Pre-Chorus]
Taking up all of my time
Now, you're taking up all of my time
Yeah, wherever you are
I'm with you from afar

[Chorus]
She makes me wonder why
She makes me wonder what I'm doing
Spending all these seconds away from her
The time I'm losing
Being far away, I'm lost in space
Make it go away, all this space between–

She makes me wonder why
She makes me wonder what I'm doing
Spending all these seconds away from her
The time I'm losing
Being far away, I'm lost in space
Make it go away, all this space between us

[Verse 1]
Something's wrong, stop
You’re gonna ruin it by leaving it too long, stop
It's gonna play out like a scene
It always does, stop

[Verse 2]
Went to meet her in Ibiza
Me and Katie went to greet her
Well, I wasn't gonna leave her
So we took her to the beach, ah

[Outro]
I suffer when she suffers
Her love is like no other's
A mother to my brother
A mother to my mother

[Intro]
Now tell me something
Is there a point to this?
Or are we living for the feeling
When we look back
On what we did and reminisce?

[Verse 1]
'Cause I’ve looked within and I've read
But instead I keep focusing
On just how thin I can get
Now I'm looking for something else
I found myself: I’m someone else

[Chorus]
I keep looking for something
Even though I know that it's not there
(Maybe you're the reason)
Every time I try to figure it out
You're the only thing I can think about
(Maybe you're the reason)

[Verse 2]
And I think I'm dying
'Cause this can't be living
Should I be searching for
Some kind of meaning?
Apathy’s a funny feeling

[Bridge]
I turned my gaze to the ceiling
Thanked a God I don’t believe in
For the scene outside
I tried my best at sleeping but
My dreams were unappealing
So I searched for people in the landscape
Passers by

[Chorus]
I keep looking for something
Even though I know that it's not there
(Maybe you’re the reason)
Every time I try to figure it out
You're the only thing I can think about
(Maybe you're the reason)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I keep looking for something
Even though I know that it's not there
(Maybe you’re the reason)
Every time I try to figure it out
You're the only thing I can think about
(Maybe you're the reason)

[Verse 1]
Lying in bed
And you're circling 'round my head
Try to picture something different instead of this
Pretend I don't exist
A paradigm shift
I was never here at all

[Pre-Chorus]
And they said that we'd get on
I didn't think it would take so long
Before you took me away from
Everything else, took me out of myself
I'm gone (Gone)

[Chorus 1]
We don't touch anymore
But we talk all the time so it's fine
Can somebody tell me what I want?
'Cause I keep changing my mind
I can see a progression
And I guess it's happening
A different direction
And I guess it's happening

[Verse 2]
Shall we start again?
What do you want to do then?
Going over and over
Growing older and older
Let's think this through
What do you want to do?
And your chin's on my shoulder
And you're turning me over

[Chorus 2]
We don't fuck anymore
But we talk all the time so it's fine
Can somebody tell me what I want?
'Cause I keep changing my mind
I can see a progression
And I guess it's happening
A different direction
And I guess it's happening

[Bridge]
Somebody tell me what I want (Want)

[Chorus 2]
We don't fuck anymore
But we talk all the time so it's fine
Can somebody tell me what I want?
'Cause I keep changing my mind
I can see a progression
And I guess it's happening
A different direction
And I guess it's happening

[Verse 1]
I knew it was this that had to give
And I was having such a good time
You know me so well and you tell me all the time
And I was having such a good time

[Pre-Chorus]
And all my friends like me and I shine brightly
And I take it lightly, and I shrug it off me
And I speak quietly, and they can't find me
Then I'm out behind me

[Chorus]
Watching myself go wild
Watching myself go wild
(Watching myself go)
(Watching myself go)

[Verse 2]
You know I'm up to scratch and they give me that
Didn't mean to mean it, I'm an acrobat
A peace machine, such a diplomat
They all believe me, I'm such an act
And I've caught you lonely, you're a fool for that
Now it's all over and I'm so glad
I'm a silver child, a first class prize
I know you're blind, but I'm in disguise
I'm cut up glass, you look inside
Cut up the past and you're still mine
Don't want it back, leave me tired
I'm out behind me

[Chorus]
Watching myself go wild
(Watching myself go)
(Watching myself go)

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I start believing in things that aren't real
And my friend likes to deceive me in the way that I feel but

[Pre Chorus]
All these things don’t happen to anybody like you
These things don’t matter to anybody but

[Chorus]
Oh, you seemed so happy to everybody you knew
These things don’t happen to anybody like you

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I start concealing
The way that I work in my head
Can't take it anymore
I won't stop feeling the weight of my world and

[Pre Chorus]
All these things don’t matter to anybody like you
These things don’t matter to anybody but

[Chorus]
Oh, you seemed so happy to everybody you knew
These things don’t happen to anybody like-
Oh, you seemed so happy to everybody you knew
These things don’t happen to anybody like you

[Bridge]
All these things don’t matter
All these things don’t matter
To anybody like

[Chorus]
Oh, you seemed so happy to everybody you knew
These things don’t happen to anybody like-
Oh, you seemed so happy to everybody you knew
These things don’t happen to anybody like you

[Verse 1]
There was a sorrow in that
She can tell I always feel the worst that I can
None of it was real
It was something far too good to feel

[Pre Chorus]
We let our heads cave in
Subject to a greater thing

[Chorus]
In faster pace, and brighter hues
I'll sacrifice the love I grew
And I did

[Verse 2]
You see that prize on my wall
It's just one off the heap
Just one from the haul
You're in the shallows of my head
And I know how you'd love to swim
Into the deep instead

[Pre Chorus]
We let our heads cave in
Subject to a greater thing

[Chorus]
In faster pace, and brighter hues
I'll sacrifice the love I grew
And I did
In faster pace, and brighter hues
I'll sacrifice the love I grew
I did

[Verse 1]
Up in my head
I'm the only one around

[Chorus]
’Cause somehow
Everybody hates me now

[Verse 2]
The sky seems clear
But I can only see the clouds

[Chorus]
'Cause somehow
Everybody hates me now

[Verse 3]
I've over-extended
Replaced all of my friends with
A linen sheet, a takeaway box
And an incomplete crossword block
With nothing left to show for it
She’s sleeping on the sofa
It's like she doesn't know that I exist

[Chorus]
Everybody hates me now
Everybody hates me now
Everybody hates me now

[Verse 1]
Oh, and did you change your mind?
Oh, you're always changing
Rearranging
Calibrating
You think far too much

[Verse 2]
Oh, and did you change your mind?
Oh, you're always changing
Rearranging
Calibrating
You think far too much

[Verse 3]
Oh, and did you change your mind?
Oh, you're always changing
Rearranging
Calibrating
You think far too much

[Verse 1]
This doesn't sit right
And I feel unreal
She's my lullaby
And I can't sleep right

[Chorus]
Only a day old, but I know what love is
Invest yourself in something worth investing in
You keep repressing it
I'm only a day old, haven't got to grips with it

[Verse 2]
I'm so much better
I don't have to be on my own
There's so much pressure not to be alone
You're sharing a house, you're sharing a life
You're sharing a home
There's so much pressure not to be alone

[Chorus]
I'm only a day old, but I know what love is
Invest yourself in something worth investing in
You keep repressing it
I'm only a day old, haven't got to grips with it

[Bridge]
I'm only a day old, but I know what love is
Invest yourself in something worth investing in
You keep repressing it
I'm only a day old, haven't got to grips with it

[Chorus]
You keep repressing it
Invest yourself in something worth investing in
You keep repressing it
Only a day old, haven't got to grips with it

[Verse 1: Golde]
She said she wanna roll with me tonight
I'ma set her free tonight
And we gon' beat the streets tonight
'Cause she just wanna live this life, yeah
She gon' put it down for the pick up
And she gotta make stories to tell
She hate being home by herself
So she grabbed a couple friends and they pull up on me and my niggas

Yeah, I'm 'bout to make your nigga jealous
Flyer than propellors, in Margielas, there ain't nothin' you can tell us
Yeah, now you mad, you ain't know 'bout me
I'm the king, nigga, better not bring your ho 'round me, I tell her

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yeah, you know what it is, yeah
One rule, no catching no feelings
Yeah, I ain't seen no ring on it
Put her on the mic, then I made her sing on it
Yeah, keep it 100

Yeah, she was yours before
She ain't with you now though

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Golde]
She ain't with you now, yeah (She ain't)

[Verse 3: R. Kelly, Chris Brown & Both]
And I know you had her first (You had her first)
But I didn't see no ring up on her finger (I don't know why)
I don't know why you tripping
You should have never let her go
'Cause one man's trash is another man's treasure
She ain't with you now though
She ain't with you now though

[Chorus: Chris Brown & R. Kelly]
She ain't with you now (Now)
She ain't with you now (She ain't with you now)
She ain't with you now though (She ain't with you now)
So why you tripping? She's not with you now
She ain't with you now though (Woah, baby)
She ain't with you now though (She ain't with you now, woah, baby)
She ain't with you now though (She ain't with you now though, woah, baby)
Oh, no, no

[Outro: R. Kelly & Chris Brown]
She's no longer your baby (Oh)
Now she is my baby (Oh)
Homie, you tripping
Get out of your feelings, oh
Ooh, she ain't with you now
She ain't with you now though
Verse 1:
Cruel world knock you down but he still good
Kind soul real reserved but he don’t act hood
But they want the prerequisites
Don’t really give a damn I grip the mic and I represent
Try to take advantage but they say I’m nicest
Writing all these verses hand cramping arthritics
Time to start some beef with all these niggas that’s behind us
I’m just speaking how I feel so let’s just go on and keep it real k-keep it real though

Chorus
I Keep it real though
You could keep it could keep it could keep it
I keep it real though (keep it real though)
Oop
I Keep it real though
You could keep it could keep it could keep it


Verse 2
Drop an EP but it started as a hobby
Spoon feed these niggas airplane kamikaze
Let them talk that negative they got the audacity
Miyagi taught me well this Backly-Chan done got the mastery
Thoughts upon my mental man I guess I should articulate
Dropping deep shit take a second let it marinate
Got a girl looking at me "like what’s your deal?"
You looking kinda cute we need to Netflix and chill- forreal though
All this bullshit messing up my mindset
Pops on me the gifts that are a godsend
I been focused been working hard on this project
It’s nonsense
Throwback to the choir days; rap battling, snapping and laughing
Honestly messing 'round but had them clapping
Navigate my future but it’s getting foggy
Told me keep going on this journey you could be somebody
I’m an artist in every form and fashion
Call it an obsession but I just call it a passion
Zia just be careful man, no guarantees
But this the life i want man, no Plan B's
I mean times be gettin' tough but I ain’t give up
If yo dreams ain’t scary then fuck 'em they ain’t big enough
This the real deal man say it no chill
I'm just speaking how I feel
Now let’s go an keep it real k-keep it real though
Chorus
I Keep it real though
You could keep it could keep it could keep it
I keep it real though (keep it real though)
Oop
I Keep it real though
You could keep it could keep it could keep it

Verse 3
Dirty D rapper out here looking for a corner to rob
I’m taking with a pitchfork and got the corn on the cob
Treat it like we fables
We reconstructing labels and now we turning the tables
I do it cause I’m able
People wanna talk you down with the cinisims
It’s kinda funny like we ever needed your permission
Stay in your lane fine like the shits division
On my grind getting big got no time to listen
Keep it real

[Verse 1]
Everybody's in a hurry, in a flurry
Shopping 'til they're droppin' in the snow
Kids are cryin', dogs are barkin'
Catchin' up with folks we barely know
Sure, it's madness, but it's magic
As soon as you hang up the mistletoe
'Cause you're the reason for the season
No, we don't need to keep up with the Jones

[Pre-Chorus]
Our love is something priceless

[Chorus]
I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

[Verse 2]
So, Mr. Santa (Mr. Santa)
Take the day off (Take the day off)
Get a massage (Get a massage)
'Cause we've got this one all under control
A little whiskey (A little whiskey)
We're getting frisky (Ooh!)
And slow dancing to Nat King Cole
No, we ain't stressin' (We ain't stressin')
Just caressin' (Mm-hmm)
Warming up our popsicle toes
Nothing's missin' (Nothing's missin')
'Cause you're a blessin' ('Cause you're the blessin')
Yeah, you're the only one I'm wishing for

[Pre-Chorus]
Our love is something priceless

[Chorus]
I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

[Bridge]
I don't need anything
Take back all the Cartier, and the Tiffany's and the Chanel
Well, can I keep that Chanel? Please?
No, no, no, no

[Chorus]
I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

[Outro]
(Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la)
Just you and me, under a tree
(Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la)
A cozy little Christmas here with you

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Baddest white bitch in the club
Hot boys on my dick in the club
Tell 'em chill out, super thick in the club

Pretty squad with me, make a minute man bust like a semi (rrah)

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Baddest white bitch in the game
I could make Future put down the drink
From trappin' in Miami, nominations at the Grammy's
Haters can't stand me, but they love me at the bank (Hey, Iggy)
You want that in all hunnids?
It really turn me on seein' bitches gettin' money
It really turn me off seein' boys actin' thirsty
I told him I'd be back, and curved him (Hey, Iggy)
Where you get that ass?
Feeling on my booty while I fill my glass
This what you want, what you need, huh?
For the dope boys doublin' their re-up
For the hot girls pullin' at their G-Strings
You're gon' give it to them soon as you leave, huh? (Leave, huh?) (Hey, Iggy)
Why they hate Iggy?
While you was on a diet, your girl made millies
Fuck beef, I got more at stake than Philly (Hey, Iggy)

[Pre-Chorus: Tyga]
Where you get that ass?
Lil-lil waist, brand new bag
(Hey, Iggy)

[Chorus: Tyga]
I say hey, Iggy, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind

[Outro: Tyga]
Baddest white bitch in the game
I could make Future put down the drink
Baddest white bitch in the club
Hot boys on my dick in the club
(Hey, Iggy)
(Hey, Iggy)

[Verse 1: Santigold]
Snow is falling, it's on the ground
First delayed but it's cancelled now
Late to the train broke myself off
Am I getting closer? Now am I getting closer?
Taking the streets, I'm moving slow
Sure made a sweat now, what's there to lose?
I just wanna get there before you go
I hope I'm getting closer
I hope I'm getting closer

[Chorus: Santigold]
Leave the lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Unlock the door
I'm coming, I'm coming
No matter how far
Leave the lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home

[Verse 2: Ryan Beatty & Tyler, the Creator]
I'll be there in the morning
I'll be there before you know it
Going fast as I can
But the traffic is bad
And my rental is slow
I'm coming, I'm coming
I'm coming home
You on my team, I can't be alone
You hear that ring, I pick up the phone
Car, a plane, a walk, a train
No matter which way baby, I'm coming home
Wish that I could press fast forward
To the part where I get there
Seeing all the lights on

[Chorus: Santigold]
Leave the lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Unlock the door
I'm coming, I'm coming
No matter how far
Leave the lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home

[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator]
Bar is low, texts slow
No goodbyes, no xo
My flight delay, no echo (Echo, echo, echo)
Hurry 'cause the plan's urgent
I'm trying to get home like the man's version
Emergency until I see you
And then you can hold mine like a hand surgeon
But let me take your bow off
Wooly knits, Prada hat so I can show off
You my gift that I can't get until I get to that front door
It's fluorescent if I leave with the lights on

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
Yeah, leave the lights on

[Intro: Tyler, the Creator]
It's gettin' cold, chocolate
Too warm, chocolate
It's too hot (Hot), chocolate

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
Leche for my (Woo!) damn self
Hot chocolate
You can use water
Hot chocolate
I prefer milk if it's 2%
Marshmallows on top and some extra whip
You can even use cinnamon, cinnamon on top
Hot chocolate

[Verse 2: Jerry Paper]
By the fire, I sip hot cocoa tonight
It makes me feel all right
It's Christmas time (Cocoa, cocoa)
Jigsaw puzzle with my buddies
Tonight is our big night
It's Christmas time (Cocoa, cocoa)

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
It gets cold in the winter, cold in the wintertime
Cold that's my favorite, cold that's my favorite time
It gets cold in the winter, cold in the wintertime

[Verse 1]
That's a goal
Could you please tell me what you know about skippin' 24, 25
'Cause your mom was at her 9-to-5
Still stacking up the dough
I was wrapping gifts age six with the paper bandanas
Mom was always honest, I ain't never had a Santa Claus
She was my amigo like my buddies from Atlanta
We was hopin' for a signal, too afraid to change the channel, yo

[Chorus]
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag
Run up the back, you runnin' to that
I run off the back, you runnin' to that
I run up the back, you runnin' to that
I run off the back, you runnin' to that

[Verse 2]
That's a big step, snow boots
But it's hot in herre, '02
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Quick, fast, big Max with the big bag, I throw 'em
You stay up, get cake up
For new gifts I take 'em
You wake up like big mad (Where's my gifts?)
Roof to roof, I jump, I jump, I take, I take
It feels the void, I want, I want (More)
Way that I sneak in
I'm about as low as self-esteem when I creep in (Boy)
Don't make noise, my feet thin
I'm looking for the paper, same color my green skin
Toys what is on the list
When it comes to this, I'm too legit
Tell all them kids that he be the Grinch
When they ask who has type of heart to do this

[Chorus]
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag
It's me

[Ryan Beatty]

When the gloves come off, I sleep
That's when the cold begins to creep (Creep in)
I can't feel my hands
Ahh

[Tyler, the Creator]
Boom, boom, ba-boom
Go down
Back to one (Two)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I awake to find no peace of mind
I said, "How do you live as a fugitive
Down here, where I cannot see so clear?"
I said, "What do I know?
Show me the right way to go"

[Chorus]
And the spies came out of the water
And you're feeling so good 'cause you know
That those spies hide out in every corner
Well they can't touch you, no
'Causes they're just spies
They're all spies

[Verse 2]
I awake to see no one is free
Well we're all fugitives - look at the way we live
Down here, where we cannot sleep from fear
I said, "Which way to turn?"
Oh, I forget everything I learn

[Chorus]
And the spies came out of the water
And you're feeling so good 'cause you know
With those spies hide out in every corner
Well they can't touch you, no
'Cause they're all spies

[Bridge]
And if we don't hide here
They're gonna find us
And if we don't hide now
They're gonna catch us where we sleep
And if we don't hide here
They're gonna find us

[Outro]
They're just spies
They're just spies
They're just spies
They're just spies

Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Woo
Smacked the shit out your bitch ass midget girlfriend, nigga (Haha)
Shittin' me?
Uh

[Chorus]
Shittin' me?
Gotta be kidding me
How could you shit on me?
You ain't got shit on me
Shittin' me?
Gotta be kidding me
How could you shit on me?
You ain't got shit on me

[Verse 1]
Why they choose my pubes every time they wanna sit? (Sit)
Couldn't ride the wave and now you ridin' dick (Dick)
These bitches got no chances, they rely on dick (Dick)
Show them how to tip (Is you shittin' me? Haha)
Ride around town on meds
Louis belt got the check
A nigga gon' die on this
A shorty gon' ride on this
Rep the set, I ride on this
Take 'em by the leg
I been feelin' like I could shit
And a nigga still bump his shit? (Rep the set motherfucker)
Stay to what's mine, state of mind
I say to myself, mostly
I stay on yo' mind, I stay in yo' mouth
You stay and you loud
Mosh it out, I need a new towel
Jump in the crowd, oh shit

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
No more wrong and I'm tryna do right
Thank God for my kids and my lovely wife
The life I used to live, I had to leave it alone
'Cause my backbone was 'bout to get it alone
What's a man to gain the world and not share?
Everything I went through helped me prepare
For the day that I talk like this
And I'm sure that Jesus walked like this
It's a fact though, exacto
Rewriting my rap flow
Come as you are, I'm posted up at the backdoor
Church panic, I'll be making the plans
Kissing their babies and shaking their hands
Man, God gave me my life back then He brought my wife back
I'm suited and booted, praising His name
Through my trials and tribulations, I'm grateful for everything

[Chorus: Tyrese]
I'm so grateful
I'm so humbled by Your love
Oh why
Where would I be without Your love?
(Where would I be without Your love?)
Said I, said I owe it all to You
Said I, said I owe it all to You, Father

[Verse 2: E-40]
Uh
You the truth
You always have had my back like a masseuse
When I was funkin' on the gravel
You would always fight my battles
The beginning, and the end, the most high
I'm hoping I get to meet You when I die
You the only one make me cry
Especially when we don't see eye to eye
When I hear the choir sing and the preacher preach
And the missionaries speaking in tongues, my aunties, uh
Trials and tribulations
All you need is the faith of a mustard seed, be gracious
And Lord, I'm grateful for my kids
And my soulmate, my rib
Gotta be strong, never be weak
Get on your knees and thank God you on your feet
Talk to 'em Tyrese

[Chorus: Tyrese]
I'm so grateful
I'm so humbled by Your love
Oh why
Where would I be without Your love?
(Where would I be without Your love?)
Said I, said I owe it all to You
Said I, said I owe it all to You, Father

[Verse 3: Tyrese]
I thank God for my life
My wife and my children
I thank God
Said I owe it all to You
Oh, I thank you, Jesus
Oh, I thank you, Jesus
For protecting my whole family, yeah
Lord, I know I could've been dead and gone
But You're not done with me
Oh, baby
Thank You for sparing my life, Jesus
It means that You're not done with me, yeah, oh
Oh, baby
Oh, whoa, whoa
(Where would I be without Your love?)

[Verse 1: John Martin]
There was a time I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home, I was a king, I had a golden throne
Those days are gone, now the memories on the wall
I hear the songs from the places where I was born

[Bridge: John Martin]
Up on the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said

[Hook: John Martin]
Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!
Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

[Verse 2: John Martin]
There was a time, I met a girl of a different kind
We ruled the world, I thought I'll never lose her out of sight
We were so young, I think of her now and then
I still hear the songs reminding me of a friend

[Bridge: John Martin]
Up on the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed

[Verse 1: John Martin]
Into the streets we're coming down
We never sleep, never get tired
Through urban fields and suburban lights

[Pre-Chorus: John Martin]
Turn the crowd up now, we'll never back down
Shoot down the skyline and watch it on prime time
Turn up the love now, listen up now
Turn up the love

Who's gonna save the world tonight?
Who's gonna bring it back to life?
We're gonna make it, you and I
We're gonna save the world tonight

We're far from home
It's for the better
What we dream, it's all that matters
We're on our way, united

Turn the crowd up now, we'll never back down
Shoot down the skyline and watch it on prime time
Turn up the love now, listen up now

[Verse]
Yeah, I know I'm a king
Stock on my shoulder, I was sinkin'
I ain't know that I could leave
Papa called me chief
Gotta keep it brief
Locked and load, I can see you lyin' through your teeth
Fingers on my soul, this is 23
Blood in the water, I was walkin' in my sleep
Blood on my father, I forgot another dream
I was playin' with the magic, hide blessings in my sleeve
Yeah, I know I'm a king, stock on my shoulder, I was sinkin'
I ain't know that I could leave
Papa called me chief
Gotta keep it brief
Locked and load, I can see you lyin' through your teeth
Fingers on my soul, this is 23
Blood in the water, I was walkin' in my sleep
Blood on my father, I forgot another dream
I was playin' with the magic, hide blessings in my sleeve
Yeah, I know I'm a king, stock on my shoulder, I was sinkin'
I ain't know that I could leave
Papa called me chief
Gotta keep it brief
Locked and load, I can see you lyin' through your teeth
Fingers on my soul, this is 23
Blood in the water, I was walkin' in my sleep
Blood on my father, I forgot another dream
I was playin' with the magic, hide blessings in my sleeve
Yeah, I know I'm a king, stock on my shoulder, I was sinkin'
I ain't know that I could leave
Papa called me chief
Gotta keep it brief
Locked and load, I can see you lyin' through your teeth
Fingers on my soul, this is 23
Blood in the water, I was walkin' in my sleep
Blood on my father, I forgot another dream
I was playin' with the magic, hide blessings in my sleeve

[Chorus]
Imprecise words
Yeah, chief, get it 'cause we mean it
Ease up, free smokin’, niggas need it
Mask off, mask on, we trick-or-treatin'
Back off, stand-offish and anemic
Yeah, my nigga Ish, told him it's a feelin’
Blast off, buckshot into my ceilin'
Why ain't nobody tell me I was bleedin'?
Please, nobody pinch me out this dream

[Verse]
I said peace to my dirty water drinkers
Psh, nobody tryna get it clean
Why ain't nobody tell me I was sinkin'?
Ain't nobody tell me I could leave
Yeah, we'd win again, seethin’ within
Seen teeth on the floor, leakin’ again
We hold the door, uh
We build the bridge, we hold the courts
Send a cease and desist to your thieves, nigga
Please do abort, I could feel when you're forcin’ it
Still in a bore riddim
Boy, I take the tour chips and go and get some decent decor
Is you gon' ribbit or will you jump?
Get some more ribbons for the born winners from the jump
Niggas don't listen 'til they whole mission was a bust
No sit-up, but it’s crunch time, shootin' in the clutch
The midsummer sunshine found me on my ones, face drippin', uh
Hate swimmin' through your bloodlines
Motherfuck the judge, same goin' to the one time, yeah
Come and take a stroll in the mud
Dip a toe in it, heard the hammer like a grudge
When you holdin' it close, we was on the cusp
It was holes in the boat, we ain't make a fuss
Uh, chosen

[Chorus]
Imprecise words
Yeah, chief, get it 'cause we mean it
Ease up, free smokin', niggas need it
Mask off, mask on, we trick-or-treatin'
Back off, stand-offish and anemic
Yeah, my nigga Ish, told him it's a feelin'
Blast off, buckshot into my ceilin'
Why ain't nobody tell me I was bleedin'?
Please, nobody pinch me out this dream

[Lyrics from Snippet]
I want you
I swear I'd stop breathing
If it would benefit you
If that’s all I had to do, mm
I'll give up everything
Because I'm in love with you
Yes, I’m in love with you

I'll give up everything
If it would benefit you
If that's all I had to do
Frogs gonna leap
Gators gonna bite
A gray wolf pack is gonna rule the night
A mountain lion's never been afraid of heights
But it's better when you can fly

[?]

[?] gonna play
The rooster can cock-a-doodle-doo all day
Catfish can swim, but I bet they'd say
It's better when you can fly

The view from the blue sky
It looks so good when you're up high
The blues come 'round, they won't get me down
I can make my escape

I'm not sly like a fox
Don't sting like a bee
A grizzly won't ever run away from me
I think of all the things they could never see
It's better when you can fly

[Film Interlude]

The view from the blue sky
It looks so good when you're up high
The blues come 'round, they won't get me down
I can make my escape

I'm not sly like a fox
Don't bite like a flea
A grizzly won't ever run away from me
I think of all the things they could never see
It's better when you can fly

Oh, the view from the blue sky
It looks so good when you're up high
The blues come 'round, they won't get me down
I can make my escape

Oh, everybody sings
But not like me
The air's much better here above the trees
Look up in the sky, I'm a sight to see
It's better when you can fly

Oh, the view from the blue sky
It looks so good when you're up high
Oh, but when I'm down, won't you come around?
Help me make my escape
No matter how high a crow can go
There's gonna come a time when he's brought down low
Oh, hit rock bottom, and I just don't know
If it's better when you can fly

[Verse 1]
I think I'll buy a gun and blame it on my hometown
It’s so cold in the D
She asked me if I think I'll ever see her again
I say, "Hopefully"

[Refrain]
And maybe that's how it’s supposed to be
Maybe that's how it's supposed to be

[Verse 2]
My heroes all died young, they hung themselves with fame
And these lunatics, molded me
I got a tattoo, it's a joke I keep a secret
I need everyone to notice me

[Refrain]
But maybe that's how it's supposed to be
Maybe that's how it's supposed to be
Maybe that’s how it’s supposed to be
Maybe that's how it’s supposed to be

[Chorus 1]
I think I'll die young with all my broken dreams
I've got it figured out, this is the golden key
Everything is how it's supposed to be
Everything is how it’s supposed to be

[Verse 3]
We messed it all up, now the world is getting warmer
L.A. will be out at open sea
Meanwhile, I'm falling down, my heart is getting colder
I hurt everyone close to me

[Refrain]
But maybe that's how it's supposed to be
Maybe that's how it's supposed to be
Maybe that's how it's supposed to be
Maybe that's how it's supposed to be (Hey)

[Chorus 2]
I think I'll die young with all my broken dreams
I've got it figured out, this is the golden key
The day my daddy died, I was down the street
I lost my only friend; people don't grow on trees
But maybe that's the way it's supposed to be
Yeah, I think that's the way it's supposed to be
Yeah, everything is how it's supposed to be
See, I think that's the way it's supposed to be (Ahh)

[Bridge]
Woah-woah
Woah-woah
Woah-woah

[Refrain]
See, I think that's the way it's supposed to be
Yeah, I think that's the way it's supposed to be
Everything is how it's supposed to be
I think this is how it's supposed to be

[Outro: Jon Posner]
Well, here we are. This is Sunday morning, October 2, 1988, and this is Versagio and Lira. Versagio who I talked to last night wanted to see Michael, so there he is. Let's see if we can get him—Michael, look up here! Where you goin', Michael? Yeah, okay. Anyway, he is a real good kid.
Hello Hello Hello Hello, Hello, Hi Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hi Hello, Hello

Hello again, I've found a friend
Finally someone to fit with me
Hello again, alone again
Hello again

Log in again, my latest trend
Someone to comfort me, no responsibility
Alone again, alone again
Hello again, alone again
Alone again, alone again
Alone again
Why can I say
Whatever I may?

Why does asking why
Sound stupid to me?

And I run it back constantly
You sit at home and watch TV

I think about how you don't do anything
But it's not like I'm special or something

Write all my songs the hardest way
Thinking way too much about life today

Didn't get what I need
For me to be
And would you blame me?

I kinda feel free...
But I don't feel like me (x8)

[Outro]
Hey Cherry, I don't know if this is weird but I thought last Saturday was really fun and I'm just calling to remind you about our date tomorrow - 6:30 sharp. So call me back, or don't and I'll just see you tomorrow. I'm really excited
This could be your comeback
No more tears to wipe back
Everyone's here
Everyone's waiting for you
Your heart's an open book
But you should know that
This is your comeback

If your days are always cool and cloudy
And your friends are lacking in the rough and rowdy
Turn it around, flip it upside down

This could be your comeback

If you're down about the state of the nation
Or if you just can't seem to resist all that temptation
Turn it around, flip it upside down
Turn it around, flip it upside down
Turn it around, flip it upside down

Everyone's here
Everyone's here
This will be your comeback
This will be your comeback
Changing mind, suffer through these changing times
Everyday is strange, suffer through each day
Wishing I could push rewind

Oh I'll lose my friends, lose my mind
Struggling through these changing times
Everyday in vain, it's hard to stay the same
Sifting through these changing lines
And what I want ain't what you got

I haven't written my feelings down in quite some time
I hope you will listen to what troubles my mind
And soon you will find

Where has all the good art
Where has all the good art gone?
Nobody's putting all their words in songs
They'll just bicker and fight
Argue and strike all day long
And die on the hill even if they're wrong
They're wrong
Changing times
It's changing times
It's changing times
It's changing times
It's changing times
It's changing times
I had found the one
But how do you keep her when you're only 21
Do you want to be tied down?
Is that really any fun?
I regret to say that two years down the line I'm still alone

Where do I begin?
How to take these feelings when I take them on the chin
I keep out of the sunlight
And out of my right mind
Never in your arms but alone
With the memory of your charms

And I see you
When I open my eyes
Tears hit the screen of my phone as I swipe
And I'll delete you when the timing is right
But I still need a clear picture of you
To sleep at night

And I see you
When I open my eyes
Tears hit the screen of my phone as I swipe
And I'll delete you when the timing is right
But I still need a clear picture of you
To sleep at night
Why did you let me see
Everything in this world that became precious to me
Then you took it away
Took it away
I won't beg you stay
Beg you to stay

And I regret to say that to this day
I just can't let you go
And I want you to know

And I see you
When I open my eyes
Tears hit the screen of my phone as I swipe
And I'll delete you, I'll delete you
I'll delete you when the timing is right
But I still need a clear picture of you
Oh I still need a clear picture of you
Oh I still need a clear picture of you
To sleep at night
Hey Cherry, I didn't hear back from you and that's fine, just making sure we're still on for tonight 6:30 sharp. I'm so really excited

[Verse]
I got a million flows, I can go silly with those
I got a pocket rocket
Down to cock and chop and pop a nigga that really impose
Niggas that's with me is villains in hoodies
That lost all they good and they feelings on road
It's so appealing, the feeling of killing a nigga that pose
Get Milli Vanillied with those
Turn a beef plate to a cheesesteak
Bitch, I be really in Philly with those
Neck rocky as a blizzard, a nigga flex gotten bigger
My wrist is so chilly, it froze
Really I'm colder than ever, my niggas goin' for whatever
Niggas gripped up, fifth tucked in the snow storm or the weather
Sandstorm or the desert, hands drawn on a Dessy
Leave his whole body bloody
Like shorty done put in her tampon on already
Shooting with a Vietnam cannon out the Peter arm on the levy
See, the charm on already
We go to jail, this shit'll be fire, we'll meet up with friends
'Cause all of our mans gone-gone already
Nigga the-, nigga the-, uh
I'ma do a three in week, I gave the Jeep the receipt
Either the double-R stitching, it's that or the Bentley B in the seat
I got my D in a freak, I gotta be in repeat
She wanna eat every morning
I treat it like porridge and gave her the cream of the wheat
And I rock it like P and a B
I don't cop it less it's Louie, Gucci on the pocket
Or even a D and a G, 'cause the way that the money piling
I'll be wildin' 'til a nigga make about a B in a week
Fuck niggas hating on me
But I'm Gary Payton, always on the team with the green
And the money counter, 'cause when I'm accounting
It be money coming in and coming out it, paper cut the money
Dummy niggas, I been thumbing out it
Trying not to run up out it in a fist fight
With a knife, nigga brought a gun up out it
Don't you run up out it, lil nigga
Uh, hit him with a mini MAC
Is he really that bad that I gotta hit him with a bigger gat?
Matter fact, riddle me that
I'm literally at the spot that he said he'd be at, but where is he at?
Like, really nigga? Is you really tellin' me that?
Like I ain't prepared to hit him with a felony act?
Like, what you thought, I would never react?
Have a nigga lookin' like he tryna fight in Smash Bros
When a nigga put a whole shell in his back
Fuck niggas yelling it back
Niggas get high and start hating on a real nigga
It's like a nigga smokin' on a jealousy pack
Look, lil' nigga, uh
I got the remedy, I got the shooters with hidden identities
Fuck who you send at me
I got a stack on me long as a ruler and centipede
I got the Genovese, I got the energy
I got the money, the power, the enemies
I go to business
I'm asking these niggas for 60 percent of the entity
No one defending me
Niggas is talking, but no one offending me
Niggas know what the result of the end'll be
Niggas won't know how to find where they men'll be
I'm a way different nigga on Hennessy
I got the recipe, none of y’all niggas sit next to me
Guard where your head and ya chest'll be
I suggest you niggas never go testin' me
I suggest you niggas never go testin' me, nigga

[Outro]
I promise y'all niggas I do this shit in my sleep, it's easy
I come to the studio and just say shit and it comes out that way
You know what I mean?
I promise y'all we down to go 36 hundred thousand rounds with anybody
Let these niggas know that all that rapping fast shit
We can do it too, nigga
Niggas be thinking they got that special sauce
Not today, nigga
Ain't that right, man?
Y'all know what the fuck goin' on, man
Who next? Who next? Who next? For real, who next?
Lemme know, lemme know, I'm off this, I'm off this
Love me now

[Intro]
Yup, yup, that's right
I'm runnin' things, I'm runnin' things

[Verse 1: Navy Blue]
Hold me down, hold me up
Hold me close 'cause my times is up
Show they true colors, don't know who to trust
Mind workin' like the water when it rush
Growin' from my father, bitter to his touch
Now I'm solely honor, livin' is a must
All this for my momma 'til I'm dust
God gon' deal the karma, lost my trust
Sayin' "Every man know many men"
Got me in a jam, I be in my feelings
On the other hand, I just need a moment
Offer my condolence, smokin' 'til the mornin'

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Brodie on the corner with a piece on his hip
Give a warning 'fore you blow it in the sky
Tiptoein' over mortar and the brick
Bumpin' shoulders with the devil in disguise
Shoulder-level water on the rise
Twist, 40s in the morning in the winter
I heard you got your sauce at the Enterprise
Evidently, it was rented but it's mine
Evidently, it was written like Nas
I was in the kitchen with that nigga Mike
Gotta listen when I tell ya simmer down
Two years I've been missin', livin' life
You was wildin', every day was trash
Crackers pilin' in to rape the land
Early morning, wash my swollen hands
Hit the showers, cleanse my soul and crash
Tiptoein' over glass, brodie go too fast, told him slow up
Know I use too much of everything at hand
Except the difference is now I control it, I be
In the crib and in the moment, stuck sippin' out the flask
Feet up on the dash, I hit the spliff but don't promote it
Under overpass, no cap
Sand fallin' out the hourglass
Grand total, it's a whole lotta raps
Quicksand, scramblin' outta that
Go behind the back, switch hands
The fare's high, niggas know they outta wack
Sterilize your clique, paralyze maritime niggas when
Every time Wavy Don tappin' in
Savion Glover caught a couple Ls
Took 'em to the neck, motherfucker

[Outro: Earl Sweatshirt]
Lotta blood to let, peace to make, fuck a check
Uh-uh, lotta blood to let, peace to make, give a fuck about a check
Lotta blood to let, peace to make, give a fuck about a check
Uh-uh, lotta blood to let, peace to make, give a fuck about a-
Nigga, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, maybe

[Intro]
I'm as stiff as rock man. Come along the—
We roam tundras

[Verse]
The boy been gone a few summers too long from road runnin'
Trunk full of old hunnids
Of course my old lover was scorned, we grow from it
Don't tell me they don't hunt us for sport, I chose substances
No cuddles, the bases is all covered
Niggas come in the door and smoke somethin'
Choke up on the slugger from home run-ins
Nigga it's on, chest thump, his head thump on the floor
We pressed up on the boy, no more bluffin'
Cold summers, don't tussle with strangers
Some of those keep one in the chamber
Three spliffs had my wing tips clipped, I was stuck in a hangar, nigga
Muffle my pain and muzzle my brain up
Really, I'm just makin' sure my promise is kept
Chuck a deuce if you know it's the end
Kept the truth in my palm and my chest
See it through, keep a noose hangin' off of my neck
We got the juice, niggas corny as shit
We on the loose, niggas know what it is
We makin' moves, niggas corny as shit
We got the juice, niggas know what it is
Yeah

[Outro]
It is night and like the others I clean my weapons
It is all so familiar

[Verse]
Bend, we don't break, we not the bank
We all we got
Switch whips, relocate way out of state
Bada bing, bada bam
It's the puppet master, all of the strings in my hand
Peace to my mans, gotta go be with your fam more (For real)
For real, I feel like the landlord
My niggas came a long way from the Dickies and dirty JanSports
Jack of all trades, was dealing niggas a handful
Bend, we don't break, we not the bank
Got memories of your face
The photo still on the mantle
It's real when you seal up letters with wax
Shit changed, now the checks that we seein' is handsome, real
Mike WiLLy shit, we went gorilla, they really gave up the ransom
You silly, we taxed 'em, bad blood
Doing 'em dashes and pulling fast ones
Seen your heart sore, got torn up in the past once
Before a jawn, young god get the cash run
Hard hung heads might starve in the end
Young god get the cash 'fore a jawn thump
Pause wit' your man, call Mos if you can, by God (By God)
Bend, we don't break, we not the bank
Switch whips, relocate all the way out of state
Tell my queens, "Keep mace"
Keep faith, brother man
They stable full of sheep, we stayin' on the lam
Game isn't cheap

[Intro: Earl Sweatshirt]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Do you niggas know?
Alright, check it out bro, bro, bro, bro
Look, uh, yeah, yeah
Uh, shit, uh, yeah

[Verse: Earl Sweatshirt]
My mood really swinging, I peruse like a native would do
What I'm thinking I should do for the sake of myself
No games with this cash, go play with yourself
We stay on your ass
Your sense of safety melt in a flash, bang
Don’t know what I'mma say
Cause I don't label the bags, I stay in ’em
See you shooting but your angles is trash
Don't play with us, I revisit the past
Port wine and pages of pads
Momma say don't play with them scabs
It's safe to say I see the reason I'm bleeding out
I need you now, closed lips make the mouth breathers frown
Two's a team, three a crowd
Twelve street, I kept some lean around
Help me, it's been a minute since I seen a decent count
The wealth be the labor's fruit
The loop hold up the belt, G’s felt
All praises due, the juice unobtainable
Like Tang in the booth
Dark face on the news
Clouds grey on the move
On the way like the truth
Yeah, yeah, uh

[Outro: Gio Escobar & Earl Sweatshirt]
I said the dark face on the news
Clouds grey on the move
On the way like the truth (On the way like the-)
Yeah, clouds grey on the move
On the way with the-

[Verse]
Main line, underneath the skin of the grapevines
Save time, serpent, no need to hiss
Found a reason to live, doubt could be an abyss
Keep fallacies off your lips, see casualties in the wind
Uh, we gathering in remembrance
Galaxy's the distance between us by Christmas
Now we crumbling, leaf over tree pre-twist (I bet)
Your heart skip a beat when you see me next
We stretch harshly, I see y'all weaves stretched (Stretched)
Parsley in your B, we hard to get involved with
In the blistering cold, watching Harder They Come
Harder they fall, I figured niggas was bold
They proved me wrong quick
Long trip, sifting through memories over dumb spliffs
Young man, flung soliloquy off the tongue-tip, uh
Uh, uh (Worth it)

[Verse]
Pedal to the metal
Lost footin', it was sugar in my gas tank
My cushion was a bosom on bad days
It's not a black woman I can't thank
You called crying when I told you these the last days
It's all mine, could've split the last plate
Niggas didn't have faith, so I stopped tryin'
Apologize, and we outta time
Please get ya alibi straight, you ain't gotta lie
Shook tradition, did it my way
No sense in looking in the sky
Trace elements meddle with minds
Mind-state live, fissures and fires
Niggas with live ammunitions in the stick on the highway
I only get better with time
That's what my mom say
To dodge Satan, say to kill him this time, oy vey
Well here I go, foot on the line
What's mine, what good is it if it's not, you shook a bit
Sookie, sookie niggas wasn't shit
Face looking like I stumbled out of a pit, hundred dollar chip
I piss problems out, the bottle empty
Mama said she used to see my father in me
Said I was not offended
Press, King, Navy, Med, MIKE on the bench
Living life like a nigga put a price on my head
Bless, this how we on it
If you need it and I want it, better come prepared
Going through it like prayers in the night sky
You look like a chair when you folding up
Hands on like a goalie with the puck, don't need any luck
See the ghost of where I was, lonesome as I was

[Intro]
My nigga
Keep faith

[Verse]
Peace to every crease on your brain
Peace to who came before me in the game
We givin' praise and glory to your name, kid
We cellophane your story so it stays
Since birth, mama raised and burped me, I ain't changed
I'm a man, I'm just saying that I stayed imperfect
Earl is not my name, the world is my domain, kid
Air Max 97 creps on the pavement
Hair got knotty, let it settle on my face, I
I've been eating good, you can see it in my tummy
But I'm buggin', I've been spending more money than I'm making
Stuck in Trump Land, watching subtlety decayin'
I ain't touch a Xan, when it-
When it's time to put my burnt body in a case
Tell my momma I said thank you
Tryna state facts, I'm tryna get through the day
I'ma play the back, I ain't into showing face, kid

[Segue]
It's been a minute since I heard applause
It's been a minute since you seen or heard from me, I've been swerving calls
It's been a minute since I heard applause

[Refrain]
Sittin' on a star, thinking how I'm not a star
I can't call it, dog
Sometimes I feel like I wanna call it off
I can't call it, dog
Big dog, finna rip the collar off, uh
Sittin' on a star, thinking how I'm not a star
I can't call it, dogs
Sittin' on a star, thinking how I'm not a star
Just can't call it, dogs, ayy

[Outro]
Keep pace, my nigga (Keep pace, my nigga)
Be safe, seek sake my nigga
Keep faith, my nigga, (Yeah yeah) ah
Me safe, she safe, keep pace, my nigga (Keep faith)
Peace, peace, peace, peace, peace, peace
Sittin' on a star, thinking how I'm not a star
Just can't call it, dogs

[Chorus]
Bear arms
Take no prisoners (Yeah)
Just make more chips and work the brakes off nigga's shit
(Straight on 'em)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Say goodbye to my openness, total eclipse
Of my shine that I've grown to miss when holding shit in
Open my lids, my eyes said my soul is amiss (Soul is)
The signs say we close to the end (Close)
My mindstate sober, I'm bent
Over the pit, pokin' the flames
Hopin' I don't total my shit, that's me though
Play the game no cheat code
Had to dish 'em a free throw
Ya mouth runnin' when you depose (Facts)
Facts, it's rugged on the peak
Don't stumble, serve culinary treats, bro (Please)
The herd hungry, gotta eat (Woah)
Why its so muddy in the creek, poet?
Threes foes coming by the fleet (Bro)
Keep low, peace, preach it
Ain't so sunny by the motherfuckin' beach
The say so, gonna phone number on the screen (Ah)
Keep low, can't nobody see me sleep
I make more money on my motherfuckin' feet
Yeah, uh (Straight on 'em)

[Refrain]
We take no prisoners
Just make more chips and work the brakes off nigga's shit
(Bear arms)
Take no prisoners
Just make more chips and work the brakes off nigga's shit
(Straight on 'em)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Say goodbye to my openness, total eclipse
Of my shine that I've grown to miss when holding shit in
Open my lids, my eyes said my soul is amiss (Soul is amiss)
The signs say we close to the end (Close to the end)

[Cheryl Harris + Keorapetse Kgositsile]
To my mentors and comrades in arms
Those presence and those gone on
Thank you to my family
(Can you see them now?)
To my partner Mysteria who I love and depend on more than I can say
(For some children)
To my son Thebe (Words like)
Cultural worker and student of life (Home)
Whose growth and insights inspire me, a thousand kisses
(Could not carry any possible meaning)
Thank you to my brothers (But displaced)
My niece (Border)
My nephews, my sisters, my friends (Refugee)
My whole family network (Consider)
Who have let me be distracted and inconsistent in my intention
(The premature daily death of their dreams)
Who've put up with crazy schedules, short tempers, mad dashes, and all the rest
(Consider what staggering memories frighten and abort
The hope that should have been
Perhaps I should just borrow
The rememberer’s voice again
While I can and say)
You know the real deal
("To have a home is not a favor")

[Verse]
Ayy
Ayy, nephew in SA, ayy
Know I'm on the way
Family saw you on the stage, left it not amazed
Thought you'd up and aim? Ayy
Now you done and braised, ayy (Braised, ayy)
Get the fuck back, you moving like they cut your 'caine, ayy
Lick the nut sack, I'm zooted in some tear-aways (Ayy)
Fleshin' through the pain, depression, this is not a phase, ayy
Picking out his grave, couldn't help but feel outta place
Tryna catch some rays, death and hops a sour taste (Sour taste)
Bless my pops, we sent him off and not an hour late
Still in shock and now my heart out somewhere on the range
Outta range, picked the lock and now we elevate
We box 'em out, my shit a million miles away
Niggas featherweight
Like we making food, father's face but I'm not afraid
My Uncle Hugh

[Intro]
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Check, check, check

[Verse]
Soothing repeat
I look down at my feet
It's a hypnotist's arm
And it works like a charm
But I won't be deprived
Real world, surreal life
Once inside, there is time
Go to sleep, you'll be fine
In the mornin' you'll find
Real life was such a grind
Off I go, day is done
Where a new one's just begun

[Chorus]
Why won't you make up your mind?
Give me a sign
Why won’t you make up your mind?
Give me a sign
Am I wasting my time living in my head?
You'll be sorry when I make up mine instead

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Why won't you make up your mind?
Give me a sign
Why won’t you make up your mind?
Give me a sign
Am I wasting my time living in my head?
You'll be sorry when I make up mine instead

[Instrumental]

[Break]
Ooh, I was just so sure of everything
Ooh, that's what you get for dreamin' aloud

[Instrumental]

[Break]
Ooh, no more mischief with my mind
Ooh, that's what you get for dreamin' aloud

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Feel it come
I, I don't know how long it's gonna stay with me
Woah, I'll let desire be, desire go
Oh, dare I face the real world?

[Chorus]
Every day, back and forth, what's it for?
What's it for? Back and forth, every day
Every day, back and forth, what's it for?
I don't know, I'll get out
Won't have to check my watch

[Verse 2]
I, I don't have the verve to be-elong to this dead side
Woah-oah, why I ever tried, I, I don't know
Oh, dare I face the real world?

[Chorus]
Every day, back and forth, what's it for?
What's it for? Back and forth, every day
Every day, back and forth, what's it for?
I don't know, I forget
Try to let desire be, desire go

[Bridge]
We can keep on walking
You can get to know me
If you just let it happen
I won’t tell anybody
Feel, feel it come, feel it come
I..

[Verse 3]
Feel it come
I, I don't know how long it's gonna stay with me
Woah, I'll let desire be, desire go

[Outro]
Thank you

[Intro]
Thank you guys
Hey, uh, give it up for White Denim
Holy moly, what a-what a bunch of freakishly good musicians
They make us look like novices
Alright
Let's see if we can prove our musical prowess
On this song, called "Half A Glass of Wine"
Go crazy, Chicago

[Verse 1]
Said you wouldn't be home late tonight
I gave up waiting at seventeen past midnight
Now my only company's a half full glass of wine

[Pre-Chorus]
Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge

[Chorus]
It's been so long
Since I've held your hand
You don't know how hard it can be

[Verse 2]
Thank God that I've been blessed with a patient mind
Cause' what I want to happen won't happen for a very long time
Now my only company's a half full glass of wine

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
It's been so long
Since I've held your hand
You don't know how hard it can be
You don't know how hard it can be

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Thank you

[Intro]
Gotta be above it, gotta be above it

[Verse 1]
And I know that I gotta be above it now
And I know that I can't let them bring me down
And I gotta bide my time as a face in the crowd
And I know that I gotta be above it now

[Verse 2]
And I know that I gotta be above it now
And I gotta bide my time as a face in the crowd
I know that I gotta be above it now
And I can't let them all just bring me down

[Chorus]
This time I'm just gonna take it
Or I'm never gonna shake it
I'll just close my eyes and make it so that
All those little things don't affect me now

[Bridge]
I know that I gotta be above it now
And I can't let them all just bring me down

[Chorus]
This time I'm just gonna take it
Never gonna shake it
Close my eyes and make it so that
All these little things don't affect me now

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Just gonna take it
Just gonna
Just take it
Just say so, go to me, so, ooh

[Chorus]
It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

[Verse 1]
I know that you think you sound silly when you call my name
But I hear it inside my head all day
When I realize I'm just holding on to the hope that maybe
Your feelings don't show

[Chorus]
It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

[Verse 2]
The seed of all this indecision isn't me, oh no
'Cause I decided long ago
But that's the way it seems to go
When trying so hard to get to something real, it feels

[Chorus]
It feels like I only go backwards, darling
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
But I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling
It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
But I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling
It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
But I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

[Outro]
Thanks so much

[Intro]
Alright guys, thank you so much
We're called Tame Impala, and we love you guys
And this song is called, "Apocalypse Dreams"
Alright, I said I'd ask Kevin a topical question
Haha, what?

[Verse 1]
This could be the day that we push through
It could be the day that all our dreams come true
For me and you
Till we're at the end of just another day
Oh, oh, oh my
Are you too terrified to try your best?
Just to end up with an educated guess
Like success
Like those times you wake up mystified

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it feels so real in my sleep
Never held something so close I couldn't keep
Into the day, the strangest feeling
Do you really live without the fear that

[Chorus]
Everything is changing?
And there's nothing I can do
My world is turning pages
While I am just sitting here

[Verse 2]
Well, am I getting closer?
Will I ever get there?
Does it even matter?
Do I really need it?
Push it out the window
On and on, we all go
(This could be the day that we push through)
Into another morning
Doesn't even matter
It was only yesterday
(It could be the day that all our dreams come true)
Didn't even know you
Now I'm gonna miss you
(Oh, it feels so real in my sleep
Never held something so close I couldn't...)

[Chorus]
Nothing ever changes
No matter how long you do your hair
Looks the same to everyone else
Everything is changing
I guess I should warn my mum
But she'll just be excited

[Instrumental Outro]

[Outro]
Thank you guys
We love you, thank you

[Intro]
Hmm-mm

[Verse 1]
Wake up and smell the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty?
When we talk, you say it softly
But I love it when you're awfully quiet
Hmm-mm, quiet
Hmm-mm

[Pre-Chorus]
You see the piece of paper
Could be a little greater
Show me what you could make her
You'll never know until you try it
Hmm-mm
And you don't have to keep it quiet

[Chorus]
And I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play

[Verse 2]
Look up, out of your window
See snow, won't let it in though
Leave home, feel the wind blow
'Cause it's colder here inside in silence
And you don't have to keep it quiet

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play

[Verse 1]
Goodbye, weekend
So long, darling
Macky's been a bad, bad boy
And when they’re preaching
Be sure to change me
Should rearrange me
Or so they thought

[Chorus]
So don't go telling me how this boy should be leading
His own life
Sometimes rough but generally speaking I'm fine
If you don’t agree with the things that go on within my life
Well, honey, that's fine just know that you're wasting your time

[Verse 2]
Sort me, place me
Give me a sign
Repeat the mantra
When you're stepping out of line
Give me, a label
Something to be
May help out the country boy
But it won't work out on me

[Chorus]
Don't go telling me how this boy should be leading
His own life
Sometimes rough but generally speaking I'm fine
If you don't agree with the things that go on within my life
Well, honey, that’s fine just know that you’re wasting your time

[Verse 1]
As I’m getting older, chip up on my shoulder
Rolling through life, to roll over and die
(Scat Singing)
Missing Hippie Jon, salad days are gone
Remembering things just to tell ‘em so long
(Scat Singing)

[Hook]
Oh mama, actin’ like my life’s already over
Oh dear, act your age and try another year

[Verse 2]
Always feeling tired, smiling when required
Write another year off and kindly resign
(Scat Singing)
Salad days are gone, missing Hippie Jon
Remember the days just to tell ‘em so long
(Scat Singing)

{Hook]
Oh mama, actin’ like my life’s already over
Oh dear, act your age and try another year
Oh mama, actin’ like my life’s already over
Oh dear, act your age and try another year

[Verse 1]
I was made to love her
Been working at it
Half of my life
I’ve been an addict

[Pre-Chorus]
And she’s been good to me
Far as I can tell she’s happy
Livin’ with her Macky

[Chorus]
So please don’t take my love away
Let my baby stay
Let my baby stay
Please don’t take my love away
Let my baby stay
Let my baby stay

[Verse 2]
Where would I be
Feeling lonely
Separated from my one and only

[Pre-Chorus]
And what’s there left to say
Far as I can tell that day
Could be on its way

[Chorus]
So please don’t take my love away
Let my baby stay
Let my baby stay
Please don’t take my love away
Let my baby stay
Let my baby stay

[scat singing]

[Verse 1]
You’re no better off
Living your life
Than dreaming at night
Wandering brain
Gets scared of the plane
Halfway through flight

[Pre-Chorus]
To take it slowly, brother
Let it go now, brother
Take it slowly, brother
Let it go

[Chorus]
Go home, go home
Go home, go home

[Verse 2]
You’re better off dead
When your mind’s been set
From nine until five
Wandering brain
Is best in the rain
Feeling alive

[Pre-Chorus]
To take it slowly, brother
Let it go now, brother
Take it slowly, brother
Let it go

[Chorus]
Go home, go home
Go home, go home
Go home, go home
Go home, go home
Part One: A Heart Like Hers

[Verse 1]
Done, done is all the love, love that I had saved for you
Gone, gone away my heart, locked inside a cage for you
And what's this that has become, has become of poor old me
Tried, so hard to believe in something that will never be

[Chorus]
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe

[Verse 2]
All, all that I could give, all I had to offer her
Is gone, simply locked away, no longer there to bother her
Now look, look at what's become, what's become of poor old me
Tried, so hard to believe in something that will never be

[Chorus]
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe
Part Two: Another One

[Verse 1]
Feelin' so confused
You dont know what to do
Afraid she might not love you anymore
And though she says she does
And hasn't lost your trust
Who could that be knockin' at her door?

[Chorus]
Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
Must be another one
Must be another one she loves

[Verse 2]
The feelin' never stops
And neither does the clock
Wishin' for tomorrow today
She still says she's true
So you start comin' to
Just as that old knockin' comes to stay

[Chorus]
Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
Must be another one
Must be another one she loves

[Verse 1]

[Verse 1]
All you 'get back, coming to the stage'
Is a girl who's new in town
She go by the name 'Where Your Stacks At?'
This pretty little thing, I swear, won't let you down
Watch her drop it like, (dat..) hey!

Pre Chorus (Inno Thakid)
Then she picked it up and pop it, everybody want's it
Facial, legendary. Body is iconic
No way that you can stop it, she's way too versatile
The music makes her dance, but the money makes her smile

[Chorus]
Oh, it's not complicated, so this won't take a while
You see, music make her dance
And money, money, money make her smile
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...)
Money, money, money make her smile
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...)
Money, money, money make her smile

[Verse 2]
She's a super freak
You wouldn't know it if you saw her outside these velvet walls
No, she don't go where preachers preach
She only go to the church where dollars fall
Watch her drop it like, (dat..) hey!

Pre Chorus (Inno Thakid)
Then she picked it up and pop it, everybody want's it
Facial, legendary. Body is iconic
No way that you can stop it, she's way too versatile
The music makes her dance, but the money makes her smile

[Chorus]
Oh, it's not complicated, so this won't take a while
You see, music make her dance
And money, money, money make her smile

Money, money, money make her smile

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Watch her....
Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...
(Inno Thakid)
As soon as I walked up in, I need some oxygen
First thing I noticed is shorty's been doing squats again
So bring them boxes in, let them know wer're some bosses
We're tossing them dollars often, no tithing, it's just the offering
She don't be hot for them, don't even want to talk to them
They pull up in the parking lot, she spots them by their moccasins
She's on the clock again, her work ethic is wild
The music gets her to dance, but the money makes her smile

[Chorus]
Oh, it's not complicated, so this won't take a while
You see, music make her dance
And money, money, money make her smile
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...)
Money, money, money make her smile
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...)
Money, money, money make her smile

Ear Drummers
Mhm, Young Money, uh huh, mhm
Yo, hold up, hold up, mhm
Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, hold up, hold up, hold up, okay, hold up
You see a bad bitch coming through, yo, what's the hold up?
I'm in that new new, me and New New when I roll up
I tell the valet, "Park my Benz and bring the Rolls up"
Yo, hold up, hold up, hold up, okay, hold up
He see me lookin' pretty every time he scroll up
Might gotta let the blicky hit you if you stroll up
Now put your hands up, it's a hold up
Run me the money (Go!)

[Refrain: Nicki Minaj]
'Cause I be the baddie B, Barbie tings, banging body B (Go!)
Everybody be on my D, yo, I gotta be (Go!) in reality
Suck a D if you doubted me
Back of the 'Bach, back of the 'Bach
Back of the 'Bach, back of the 'Bach (Woo!)
Who on Barbie D? Who on Barbie D? Everybody (Go!)
Ooh, you gotta see, honestly, on my odyssey (Go!)
I'm the baddest B, I don't even know how to speak
Hat to the, hat to the back and relax, you in the back of the 'Bach
(Come on!)

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
See, a bitch got more coins than a game room
So we ain't ever hatin' in TheShadeRoom
See, I keep my sons in a playroom
So me and you ain't ever in the same room

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I tell him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And when he eat the cookie he got good form
He know I don't never cheat because I'm good to him
Might gotta have his baby, nurses yellin' "push" for him
You see I let him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And whenever he eat the cookie he got good form
He know that when I'm pullin' up, I'm in a good foreign
I be like, ooh, he love me, ooh, he love me, good for him
Come on, come on, come on
I be like ooh, he love me, ooh, he love me, good for him
Come on

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I slick, slick drop the top like nip slips
So he tryna smash like when the whip flips
I hit licks just to floss with this wrist
And when I leave my bitches, we all say, "Kiss, kiss"
I'm in that new new De La Renta, channeling Bugs Bunny
'Cause all I want is karats and some big drug money
I'm only loyal to the niggas that'll bust guns for me
The jig up, it's a stick up, run me the money (Go!)

[Refrain: Nicki Minaj]
'Cause I be the baddie B, Barbie tings, banging body B (Go!)
Everybody be on my D, yo, I gotta be (Go!) in reality
Suck a D if you doubted me
Back of the 'Bach, back of the 'Bach
Back of the 'Bach, back of the 'Bach (Woo!)
Who on Barbie D? Who on Barbie D? Everybody (Go!)
Ooh, you gotta see, honestly, on my odyssey (Go!)
I'm the baddest B, I don't even know how to speak
Hat to the, hat to the back and relax, you in the back of the 'Bach
(Come on!)

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
See, a bitch get more press than a keypad
Before you suck me off, get a knee pad
See, I pull the strings like a tea bag
I'm prolly with my jeweler playin' freeze tag

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I tell him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And when he eat the cookie, he got good form
He know I don't never cheat because I'm good to him
Might gotta have his baby, nurses yellin' "push" for him
You see I let him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And whenever he eat the cookie, he got good form
He know that when I'm pullin' up, I'm in a good foreign
I be like ooh, he love me, ooh, he love me, good for him
Come on, come on, come on
I be like ooh, he love me, ooh, he love me, good for him
Come on

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & Nicki Minaj]
Barbie, (Yes?) I think you gnarly (Ooh)
I think you fly, these other bitches just larvae (Haha)
When you make that ass jump like my heartbeat
And if you let me eat the pussy, then it's shark week
"Hello, may I speak to Tunechi?" May I ask who's callin'?
Everybody got the juice without a glass to pour it
I want my cake and eat it, too, and after that, I'm starving
I feel like Adam, but I'm 'bout to eat a apple on you, uh
Rollie on the right side, now y'all on my time
Please get off my dick before it turn into a pipe bomb
Eyes lookin' like I'm somewhere outta Taiwan
Faded as fuck as always, hi mom
Look dude, I'll stomp your ass out in my good shoes
Be my foot stool
Told my lawyer don't call me 'less it's good news
Then my phone started ringing off the hook, snooze, brrr

[Outro: Nicki Minaj & Lil Wayne]
'Cause I be the baddie, B
Young Money, it's a army
He ain't into toys, but he fuck with the Barbie
It's the president, Monica what they call me
Nicki the ninja, Nicki the boss, Nicki the harajuku, ah
Remix, baby
Mula
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Give up my life for the rhythm
For the beat of a heart
Like hers
Start it over to the rhythm
To the beat of a heart
Like hers

[Chorus]
And believe me
I've been waiting for her
Believe me
I've been waiting for her

[Verse 2]
Listen closely for the rhythm
To the beat of a heart
Like hers
Could I quit it?
Start it over
To the beat of a heart
Like hers

[Chorus]
And believe me
I've been waiting for her
Believe me
I've been waiting for her
Believe me
I've been waiting for her
Believe me
I've been waiting for her

[Verse 1]
Is it true?
You’ve been feeling sort of low these days
Just don’t have a place to go these days
Must be bringing you down

[Pre-Chorus]
If it’s so
Then come on give this lover boy a try
I’ll put the sparkle right back in your eyes
What's there to lose?

[Chorus]
Well for one, her heart belongs to another
And no other heart will do

[Verse 2]
Is it wrong
To think my love could really help you out?
It’s simply just my stubborn heart no doubt, rambling away

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If it’s not
Then come on give this lover boy a try
I’ll put the sparkle right back in your eyes
What could you lose?

[Chorus]
Well for one, her heart belongs to another
And no other heart will do
For one, her heart belongs to another
And no other heart will do

[Verse 1]
She couldn't be from up above
I never want another one
Like her coming around

[Refrain]
Picking me up
Just to put me down

[Verse 2]
She couldn't be from down below
For if she was, my heart would know
And when it knows it just won't go
Down

[Refrain until fade]
Picking me up
Just to put me down
Picking me up
Just to put me down
Picking me up
Just to put me down
Picking me up
Just to put me down
Picking me up
Just to put me down
Picking me up
Just to put me down
Picking me up
Just to put me down
Picking me up
Just to put me down
Picking me up
Just to put me down

[Verse 1: Mac Demarco]
How's your heart been beating?
How's your skin been keeping?
How's the dream been going since you've came back home this time?
You left her out there somewhere
Told her how you feel but
Never really got the chance to show her what it really means to love her

[Chorus]
The way you'd love her
The way you'd love to love her
The way you'd love her

[Verse 2: Mac Demarco]
Closer to the ending
She's still out pretending
Prying eyes won't recognize the way she feels about him
She'll just go on living
The river keeps on rolling
Knowing all the time she'll never understand just what it means to love her

[Chorus]
The way you'd love her
The way you'd love to love her
The way you'd love her

[Chorus]
Love her
The way you'd love her
The way you'd love to love her
The way you'd love her

[Verse 1]
Will she love me again tomorrow
I don't know, don't think so
And that's fine, fine by me
As long as, long as I know she's happy, happy

[Chorus]
Without me
Without me
Without me
Without me

[Verse 2]
Will she find love again tomorrow
I don't know, I hope so
And that's fine, fine by me
As long as, long as I know she's happy, happy

[Chorus]
Without me
Without me
Without me
Without me

[Verse 1: Jacob Collier]
She's ocean wide, canyon deep
From open eyes to twilight sleep
She's in the sky, beneath my feet
I said to her, "Don't wait for me
I watched you grow, you set me free
Go spread your wings, tell me what you see, you see"

[Verse 2: Laura Mvula]
And what I'll find, you'll never know
You'll be far ahead, I'll be long ago
But I'll be here even when I go, you know
Unspoken words I long to say
We'll save them for another day
I wish you light along the way, your way

[Verse 3: Jacob Collier & Laura Mvula]
But if you only take my hand
You'll always go where I go, and you'll come home
I know I'll find you there
Paint a picture of the world you see
(What do you see? What do you see?)
Together you and I will always be (Always be, always be)
We'll hold each other as we go around
(What do you see? What do you see?)
Whichever universe it is we've found
(What do you see?)

[Outro: Jacob Collier]
The day is cold, the fire so warm
Gonna take some more to erase the storm
I think of you from dusk 'til dawn
'Til dawn

[Verse 1]
And though I've tried before to tell her
Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve, as I’ve done from the start

[Chorus]
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turn me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now you know my love for her goes on
On and on and on and on and on and on

[Verse 2]
Now do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met?
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

[Chorus]
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turn me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now you know my love for her goes
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turn me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now you know my love for her goes on
On and on and on

[Bridge]
I resolved to call her up a thousand times a day
And ask her if she’ll marry me in some old fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before, my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone?

[Chorus]
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turn me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now you know my love for her goes on
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turn me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now you know my love for her goes on

[Outro]
Every little thing, every little thing, every little thing
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh (Ooh), eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Every little thing she does, every little thing she does
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Every little thing she does is magic, magic, magic, magic, magic
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh oh oh oh
Once, you needed somebody
To hold you close to your body
But I'd already gone
Once, you listened for someone
A voice to soothe your aching heart
And I told you goodbye

Time passes us by
Seems like our day is gone
But I know, in my heart, I’ll always care for you
And you'll care for me
And I will always remember the world we shared
The road may be long, long, long, long
But someday, I'll hold you close once more

Time passes us by
The sun in your eyes is gone
But I know, in my heart, I’ll always shine for you
And I will always remember the world we shared
The road may be long, long, long, long, long, long, long
But someday, I'll hold you close once more
I'll hold you, hold you once more, hold you once more
I'm gonna hold you, I'm gonna hold you, hold you
Hold you once again
The road may be long, the road may be long, long, long
Long, long, long
I'm gonna hold you

Bad bitch fuck me in my Gucci tube socks (Yeah)
'Member when I spent my re-up on a oowop, woah
Your favorite rapper a mumble rapper
Walk up in this bitch, a bunch of killers and humble trappers
I can't go to Hollywood, to cool in this jungle action
With niggas that'll smoke you, go and murder your brother after
Whoa, big dog, nigga, I'm a big dog
Streets said they need that dope, they having withdrawals
I put on my yellow diamonds when I'm pissed off
I'm so rich that I can't even fuck a bitch raw, whoa
Do you know the feeling? (Do you?)
Being irritated 'cause you gotta count a million
All this fucking money, I ain't got no time for chilling
We took risks to look like this, through all that killin' and drug dealin'
You my nigga, I fuck with you, we gon' thug it out
Say it's beef? We going to war, nigga, let's slug it out
Big Bad Wolf, we at your door, blow down your fucking house
I heard your daddy was a rat, so you a fucking mouse, nigga
Pouring champagne 'cause all my niggas dead
If they ain't in the graveyard, then they in the feds
I give a fuck if that crown heavy, put it on my head
Take it to the jeweler, bust it down before I wear it (Yeah)
Whew, 'cause I'm a king just like Martin Luther (Martin Luther)

You a thottie, I won't cuff you like a cop, whore, no way (Like a cop)
Ooh, I just cashed out

Flying private to Dubai, we off the Xanny bars
Ooh, scary hours, turn the cameras off, please

[Verse 1]
Babe, there's something tragic about you
Something so magic about you
Don't you agree?
Babe, there's something lonesome about you
Something so wholesome about you
Get closer to me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
No tired sigh, no rolling eyes, no irony
No "who cares?", no vacant stare, no time for me

[Chorus]
Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming
Honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden
Just to sit outside your door

[Verse 2]
Babe, there's something wretched about this
Something so precious about this
Where to begin?
Babe, there's something broken about this
But I might be hoping about this
Oh, what a sin

[Pre-Chorus 2]
To the strand, a picnic planned for you and me
A rope in hand for your other man to hang from a tree

[Chorus]
Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming
Honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden
Just to sit outside your door

[Chorus]
Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming
Honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden
Just to hide outside your door
Mmm

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You asked me to come over (over)
You said that you would be alone (alone)
And when I got there for you
Someone was in your room
You gotta play these games with me
And all I could do is slam the door
Can't stand you anymore (you're breaking me down, down)

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Woah, woah

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You know exactly what to do to hurt me (hurt me)
It's working (it's working)
It's working
You know exactly what to do to hurt me (hurt me)
It's working (it's working)
It's working

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
But was it worth it? (woah)
To lose me forever
Did I deserve it? (Maybe, maybe)
I guess it’s making me better, making me better

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Woah, woah

[Verse 3: Euro]
Euro
Let's play, I trust you and you trust me (okay, go)
Anything you wanna say to me
Any song you wanna play for me, play slow
I take my time to listen, don't waste your time and listen
'Cause they say love will kill you, let me say my dying wishes
Ain't this world is so called riskers?
Girl it's your call to risk it
You called I had to pick up to make up for all my misses
But when we're together, you act like a different artist
So I painted this to show you I'm better at being heartless, you know

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You know exactly what to do to hurt me
It's working, it's working
You know exactly what to do to hurt me, yeah (oh yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
You know exactly how to hurt me
It's working, it's working
Oh, oh, oh, oh, woah, woah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, woah, woah

[Verse]
And it goes on
Kill a pussy nigga with his pantyhose on
The gun is equipped for what ever hand it goes on
To kill a backpack nigga with his Jansport on
Geek ass nigga
Dweeb ass nigga
Never had a G-pass nigga
'Bout to ski mask his ass and eat fast nigga
Pull the heat fast and blast
And leave that nigga
With his seat back nigga
I'm a number one nigga in no time
I been waiting for a nigga to give me the showtime
In the jungle waiting for you to slip on the oak vine
I'ma do this nigga like I was chewing a pork rind nigga
Eminem couldn't get ya to a million on the 'Gram
Chris Brown tried, nigga failed both times
I done took ya page to a million in a day
If you ask me, nigga, I'm ya motherfucking cosign
I'ma hit the pussy ass nigga with a clothesline
I'ma have to catch a nigga slipping in my own time
I just took the flame on a private ass plane
Out to Massachusetts, catch this nigga slipping in his hometown
Ya see what go around come around and go around
So I got his hoe going round like it go around
Let these niggas know I'm not the one to toe-to-toe around
Singing ass nigga not the one to leave your hoe around
I'm about to hit him with the end of the K
Word to my niggas in Heaven I'm 'bout to send em away
I'm exhausted I kill this nigga two times
24 hours man this shit been a repetitive day
Nigga tell me is it Joyner Lucas, Lucas Joyner?
I'm the nigga who destroy ya
Coupe deploy ya, label drop ya, who's the lawyer?
Buy ya contract from them back and be who employ ya
Oops, I'm going, who's condoning? Juice and jonesing
Met ya bitch she too conjointed
Tryna ask this pussy ass nigga who the fuck want smoke
But the lightskin niggas in ya crew too spooked to join in
I'm a nasty nigga, then you could ask these nigga
The shotty dumping popping up outta the backseat, nigga
I'm 'bout to leave his body bloody like a maxi, nigga
I tax these niggas, get at these niggas, attack these niggas
The venom is arachne, nigga
I'm 'bout kill da man and da man that done backed these niggas
And blam any man that'll try to dap you niggas
And clap any stan fan that attract you niggas
See ya daddy was a musician that never made  it
'Cause when you was born nigga it was you or him
Shattered knowing he would never make it as an artist
And the odds of his life prolly be 2 to 1
But I give it to him 'cause he didn't run
I guess he figured, "man when you look at it in a nutshell
All I got is a failed music career and
My revenge is giving that shit to my son"
Nigga I'ma flossy nigga
They try to toss me nigga
The 45th I get em off me nigga
I block niggas Chris Bosh these niggas
I got figures pish posh to niggas
I dump niggas, jump, criss cross these niggas
The pump leave 'em slumped, in the car seat nigga
The skunk in the trunk was an awkward nigga
That thought he didn't need to have caution with him
A cornball with a Boston fitted
I said hold up my nigga man this shit crazy
You fucked AYLEK$ man that shit crazy
Nigga said he out here running threesomes with the
Nigga that's in court dealing with the kid cases
I'ma hit a stain then I hit a bad one
Pull up on the nigga hold em up for ransom
I got five plaques this year, you did a whole song with Eminem and still don't even have one nigga
Damn, my lil homie that’s a bad one nigga
Really feel bad for you it's a sad one nigga
Hold your head steady maybe you could have one nigga
Hit me for a hook and maybe get a plaque young nigga
Shout go out to Wayno and Ak my nigga
Tomorrow they'll be talking 'bout you got smacked young nigga
From the pack my nigga
I'm keeping this shit a stack, my nigga
That "Litty" verse was wack, my nigga
They go hard my dawg, but I go harder nigga
Atcha head with the fade like a barber nigga
Try to come for the boat and I'ma harbor niggas
Be smart like a Harvard nigga don't start with niggas
And he got a problem with us
But nigga, I know how to solve it nigga
This is my son
I'ma tell 'em like Star Wars, "Lucas, I am your father" nigga
You a perpetrating, work for hire, twerk for payment
Busta Rhyme impersonating, worthless baby, irks him daily
Hurts to say it, burger flipping, birthed in 80s
Tryna be a 90s baby, thirty something tryna chase it
Tryna make it, rocks designer, kinda fakes it
Hates to face it
That he'll never be a nigga that be placed for A-list, niggas damn
Here's what he's thinking right now
"I'm Joyner Lucas, why did I start it with this guy?
Tory Lanez coming back what am I gonna do this time?
They ain't like none of my diss lines
Everybody knows I can spit it in quick time
Even if the lines is as shitty as 6ix9ine's
But this time they ain’t really letting me get by
Fuck I'm finna do with this shit now?
Damn I know this nigga finna be wild
Knowin' this nigga bout to kill me on it OD now
Don't nobody ever wanna book me for a show
I ain't got no songs when I go I spit freestyles
Try to make songs 'bout depression
But nobody ever get it
So I take it out on popping niggas beats now
I ain't never ever trapped
I ain't never slung a gat
But the world don't know so fuck it, I'm a G now"
Man, what the fuck wrong with him?
I know something wrong with him
I got a hundred bunch o' bullets 'bout to put 'em all in him
Nigga walked in with a hundred rounds in him
And he's seen a nigga chicken I was comin' down in it
Glock nine nigga gotta run around with it
I'ma son a nigga, keep it at least one-a-round with it
Backpack niggas ain't sellin' no records
Better dumb it down with it when you come around with it

[Outro]
This shit is easy man
Yo it's crazy nigga
I'm really-, I'm really-, I'm really being very generous, you know?
Like I'm really doing you a favor, it's not a lot of niggas in my status that come down just to, you know, to come down and spank you niggas, pause man
It's crazy, but you know
I'ma do for you what niggas didn't do for me - that's older brother status
So if you blow from this point on, I'm your cosign nigga, you know what it is
Ayy Slow, that's facts right?
Big facts, word to Ralph, nigga, word to big Jevante too, nigga
You know what's going on nigga-, you know what the fuck's going on, nigga
One Umbrella gang, nigga

[Intro: Beyoncé]
Let me shoot across the sky

[Verse 1]
When you try your best, but you don't succeed
Get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
When the tears come streaming down your face
'Cause you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
What could be worse?

[?]Oso cantas rotas, oh

[?]

[Chorus]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
I will try to fix you
Gracias a todos
This is for Tiffany, this song
My family

[Verse 2]
Well, high up above or down below
When you are too in love to let it show
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth, no

[Chorus]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
Can't stop her

[Bridge]
Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face, and I
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from all my mistakes
Tears stream down your face, and I
Let's go, go

[Chorus]
Lights will guide you home
Oh, and ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

[Outro]
Gracias todo mundo
¿Todo el mundo listo?
¿Seguro todo el mundo listo?
No puedo oir, no puedo oir

[?]
¿Todo el mundo listo ahora?
¿Ahora?
¿Ahora?
Vamos a todos!

[Verse 1]
Stuck inside these four walls
Sent inside forever
Never seeing no one nice again
Like you, mama
You, mama
You

[Segue]

[Verse 2]
If I ever get out of here
Thought of giving it all away
To a registered charity
All I need is a pint a day
If I ever get out of here
If we ever get out of here

[Segue]

[Verse 3]
Well, the rain exploded with a mighty crash
As we fell into the sun
And the first one said to the second one there
"I hope you're having fun"

[Hook]
Band on the run
Band on the run
And the jailer man and Sailor Sam
Were searching everyone
For the band on the run
Band on the run
For the band on the run
Band on the run

[Verse 4]
Well, the undertaker drew a heavy sigh
Seeing no one else had come
And a bell was ringing in the Village Square
For the rabbits on the run

[Hook]
Band on the run
Band on the run
And the jailer man and Sailor Sam
Were searching everyone
For the band on the run
Band on the run

Yeah, the band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run

[Verse 5]
Well, the night was falling as the desert world
Began to settle down
In the town they're searching for us everywhere
But we never will be found

[Hook]
Band on the run
Band on the run
And the County Judge, who held a grudge
Will search forevermore
For the band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Papamitrou Boi

Prob gon' pitch it, we gon' hit it like we Sammy Sosa (Gimme that)
Put that Bentley to the limit, you can smell the odor
Ho, Spanish bitches call me "Chulo"
When I'm pullin' up in that two door
Diamonds different color, UNO

When I hit you with that, you know (You know)
You know, smoke a little hookah (Hookah)

And when we get in mood, I'ma dog it like I'm Cujo, whoa

[Chorus: Meek Mill]

Spicy mamis on the way, bust it down, bust it down
Saw my watch, she love the way I flood it out, ayy
Talk to me nice, show you what these Bentleys 'bout, whoa
Pipe down, throwin' up shots
First we shut them down, then we open up shop
Realest nigga around just in case y'all forgot
They've been tryna stop the wave, but the wave don't stop

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Uptown, nigga
I was down, but they see I'm up now, nigga
Head high 'cause I'm holdin' up my crown, nigga
Never told even through the ups and downs, nigga
And if I D'usse, it's a cup of brown, nigga
Only way I double cross is
I just keep spinning, only way to make 'em nauseous
Dímelo, mami, like salsa, we could dip
I'm just tryna see you dance, salsa on the dick, whoa
It went down, she came up, you know
Y'all take shots, y'all aim up, you know
Hate on low, but we fly high, you know
Talk is cheap, free Wi-Fi, whoa

[Chorus: Meek Mill & Anuel AA]
Heard they tryna steal the wave, cut it out, cut it out
Spicy mamis on the way, bust it down, bust it down

Pipe down, throwin' up shots (Brrr)
First we shut them down, then we open up shop (Anuel, ah)

They've been tryna stop the wave but the wave don't stop (Ah, brrr, haha)

[Verse 3: Anuel AA]
Vo' a estar al volante (Volante) y al la'o está el cantante (Brrr)
El que tiene guerra con los narcotraficantes (Haha)
Hijo 'e puta, tengo cuatro rutas (Uy)
Y lo' vendo a treinta y dos como Karl Malone en Utah (Utah)
Louboutin, Dolce y Versace (Jaja)
Vo' a morirme millonario, los Illuminati (Los Illuminati)
La Glock y las puta' en el bote (Brrr)
Y las nalga' como Jennifer López, brrr (Ah)
Y ella rebota ese culote

Pipe down, throwin' up shots
First we shut them down, then we open up shop
Realest nigga around just in case y'all forgot

[Intro]
This shit right here for my Oodles o' Noodles babies
His ma’ smoked the crack while she was pregnant so he can't even help that he crazy
He goin' to jail, it’s inevitable, forreal

[Verse 1]
I ain't have nobody to give me no hope
I hope my momma ain't doin' no coke
I used to wish that my daddy was livin'
I had a dream that I seen him as ghost
I used to act up when I went to school
Thought it was cool, but I really was hurt
Wanted my family to come to my games
My mama couldn't make it 'cause she was at work
Lived with my grandma, she took me to church
Really no I ain't wanna go
Remember I kissed my aunt in the casket
And her forehead was cold
I was like 4 years old
We couldn’t afford no clothes
It was hand me down
Who would think a nigga get a Grammy now?
Got a black judge tryna tear me down
All this jail time probably wear me down
Turn the lights off in the bathroom
Screaming, "Bloody, Bloody, Bloody Mary" now
Havin’ nightmares about Candyman
With the tool on me like a handyman
Killed my lil' cousin, I’m like, "Damn it, man"
Had to see the footage on a camera, man
On the pavement, with his brains out
With the white sheet, he was laid out
Wanna ask 'Ye, "Is this a choice?"
It was like this when I came out
What the fuck is you really complaining 'bout?
I know niggas that's never gon’ make it out
This that shit you won't see in the media
Poor get poorer and the rich gettin' greedier
Lot of daddies goin' back and forth out of jail
Lot of sons growin' up and repeating them
This the belly of the beast, you won't make it out
Man, this shit was designed just to eat us up
And my momma told, "Nigga, keep it up
You gon' end up in prison, just sweepin' up"
Remember, nobody never believed in us
When they see us now, they can't believe it's us, no

[Interlude]
I think it's funny how
We used to go to school, play SEGA's
And then, next thing you know, you runnin' 'round with Glock .40s
We ain't never believed in the police, they was shootin' us

[Verse 2]
Yeah, they called it the projects, they put us in projects
What they gon' do with us? Can't call the cops yet
You might just get popped at
'Cause they the ones shootin' us
I'm on my mom's steps, it's like a bomb threat
The violence pursuing us, I ain't meet God yet
'Cause I'm on the block where
It's just me and Lucifer, look what they do to us
They know we in poverty
When I went to court, the judge said, "Meek, you a menace to society"
Huh, you said, you would give me a chance, your honor, why would you lie to me?
16 more years of probation, you know you gon' get some more time on me, huh
Whole hood goin' crazy, babies havin' babies
She was fourteen, actin' like she eighty
Got pregnant by a nigga that was locked up in them cages
And the story goes on, if you make it, you amazing (Word up)

[Outro]
See, I got homie that's a billionaire
And I be tryin' to explain it to him like
If your mom ain't on crack or if she got a job and she doing eight hours a day
And your daddy in the graveyard or in the jail cell, who the fuck gon' babysit?

[Intro: Trey Songz & Chris Brown]
Yeah, oh

Yeah, you and your girls goin' out tonight, oh

Okay, listen to it

[Verse 1]
Tragic, all my niggas robbin', baskin'
Action, cameras, lights, dancin'
Actually I'm so clean I should be in someone's casket
My money not average
Pull up on your daughter in the Aston on Davins
Migos right behind me and they dippin' and dabbin'
I just pour the 8 inside of cranberry raspberry
Guwop put me onto that, yeah, free him to be exact
I just seen my priest, I got some B's on me like Da Brat
Toe jam massacre, shoot up out the Cadillac
All we know is abstract
Yellow diamonds on me, bitches screamin' "Where the cab at?"
Hopped up in that bitch and told them "Take me where the Ave at"
Call 'em hyenas, cuz the pussy niggas laughin'
Twelve took my gun, so i might just gon' and stab that
Money so tall like a muh'fucking giraffe neck
We party hard, where the fuck is RiFF RAFF at?

[Interlude 1]
Oh my God we party motherfuckin animals, you know what I'm sayin'?
Aye somebody call RiFF RAFFF and tell him to bring me some muh'fuckin molly

I wanna smoke me some backwoods with that good-good
Scooter on the way to serve me a bag too, I swear to God
No cap

[Bridge 1]
No cap, no Jeff (Ayy)
These niggas flexin, they don't got no cap left (Ayy)
I got some marble floors they heat up on the steps (Hey)

And they only for the faculty (what)
Bitch I got it bad, I'm not average
Mix that actavis with green, nigga pretty please
Turn the tide, nigga lean, nigga leanie lean
And I know its just a dream, it's a bigger league
Bit back up and I'm so clean, John F. Kennedy
Ten thousand dollars on a mirror 'cause it's vanity (What?)
I just gotta him in the pen, now he's small again
I'm never sorry that I smoked him, hope he die again
I gave my clothes to a junkie when my trial end

I kick that pussy bitch out, wildin'

[Interlude 2]
Udigg what I just said?

Run up trynna take it I'ma show you what the semi do
I just wanted to nut, baby girl I'm never feelin' you
No I'm never feelin' you
Waitin' on you to get wrong, so lil Dolly can come drillin' you
If you got them racks, baby girl you know I'm feelin' you
You got some appeal in you, and you lost your ceiling too
Big dinosaur B, baby girl, I'm billin' you

[Outro]
Let that motherfucker breath, you know?
This is YSL
This is who you love
This is who you need
And then she holds my hand, mm
And then I understand, mm
Her eyes afire with one desire
Then a heavenly kiss
Could I resist?

And then she dims the light, mm
And then she holds me tight, mm
One kiss, one fond caress
Will lead the way to happiness
She takes me to paradise

One kiss, one fond caress
Will lead the way to happiness
She takes me to paradise

[Intro: Miley Cyrus]
Oh, you broke my heart
I told you I was weak for love
But then you went around
And did what you wanted to do
And now I'm crying, crying

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
Ooh, it seemed like everything was going fine
I found the love that I thought was gonna last
But then I accidentally saw a few things in your cell
I even LOL’d
Man, I should've known
Why? Why you're doing what you do?
You, you might as well just tell the honest truth
See, I’m not really down with this
This ain't no texting shit
No, I ain't got no biz, but it is what it is

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I got two, ooh-ooh, letters for you
One of them is "F" and the other one is "U"
'Cause what you gotta do is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh-ooh, letters to choose
One of them is "F" and the other one is "U"
SMH
I'm pressing "send" on you

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
Oh, I know what's been going on
Don't even try to act like Mr. Super Nonchalant
What makes you think I’ll stick around?
I’m not as stupid as you sound
And you sound really dumb right now
From A to Zed, ooh-ah
I got a lot of nasty things floating up in my head
But none of them are worth my time
You're not even worth this rhyme
And I don’t, I don't give a flying

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I got two, ooh-ooh, letters for you
One of them is "F" and the other one is "U"
'Cause what you gotta do is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh-ooh, letters to choose
One of them is "F" and the other one is "U"
SMH
I’m pressing "send" on you

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
In alphabetical order
F comes before U
X(ex) is towards the end
That's how I know that we're through

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I got two, ooh-ooh, letters for you
One of them is "F" and the other one is "U"
'Cause what you gotta do is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh-ooh, letters to choose
One of them is "F" and the other one is "U"
SMH
I'm pressing "send" on you

[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning (in the morning)
'Cause I don’t wanna leave home without your love
Without it

[Verse 1]
You told me that you wanted this
I told you it was all yours
If you're done with it, then what'd you say forever for?
If forever is out the door
I’ll ignore when you call

[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning (in the morning)
'Cause I don't wanna leave home without your love
Without it

[Verse 2]
You told me you were coming back, right back
You promised it was real, and I believe that
But if I fall for it again, I would be a fool
If our love is at the end, then why do I still want you?
But I guess I got no valentine
Send me roses, I'll just let 'em die
I was crazy thinking you were mine
It was all just a lie

[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don't wanna leave home without your love
Without it

[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don’t wanna leave home without your love
Without it

[Intro]
Rock Mafia

[Verse 1]
For those who don't know me, I can get a bit crazy
Have to get my way, yep
24 hours a day, 'cause I'm hot like that
Every guy, everywhere just gives me mad attention
Like I'm under inspection
I always gets a ten, 'cause I'm built like that

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I go through guys like money flying out the hands
They try to change me, but they realize they can't
And every tomorrow is a day I never plan
If you're gonna be my man understand

[Chorus]
I can't be tamed, I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed, I can't, can't
I can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed, I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed

[Verse 2]
If there was a question about my intentions, I'll tell ya
I'm not here to sell ya or tell you to go to hell
I'm not a brat like that
I'm like a puzzle, but all of my pieces are jagged
If you can understand this, we can make some magic
I'm wrong like that

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go
I wanna be a part of something I don't know
And if you try to hold me back, I might explode
Baby, by now you should know

[Chorus]
I can't be tamed, I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed, I can't, can't
I can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed, I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed

[Bridge]
Well, I'm not a trick you play
I'm wired a different way
I'm not a mistake, I'm not a fake, it's set in my DNA
Don't change me, don't change me
Don't change me, don't change me
(I can't be tamed)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go
I wanna to be a part of something I don't know
And if you try to hold me back, I might explode
Baby, by now you should know

[Chorus]
I can't be tamed, I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed, I can't, can't
I can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed, I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed

[Verse 1]
I guess it's true
The only reason I called you last night
The reason I've been standing on a wire
This dream I keep having where I'm begging just to give myself a break
There's nothing I wouldn't do to wake up and remember
I wanna wake up and remember
(Take my clothes, I'm begging)

[Chorus]
I think pain is waiting alone at the corner
Tryna get myself back home, I'm
Looking like everybody
Knowing everybody lost somebody
I'm standing here in the cold, and
I gotta get myself back home, I'm
Looking like everybody
Knowing everybody lost somebody

Everybody lost somebody

[Verse 2]
Waited 'til the night was over
Cursed the sun for coming up all over
Cashed the checks I had, I didn't own
Standing on the corner
God, I wonder when I'll give myself a break

There's nothing I wouldn't do to settle up in heaven
It's a debt I gotta settle in heaven
(Take my clothes, I'm begging)

[Chorus]
I think pain is waiting alone at the corner
Tryna get myself back home soon
Looking like everybody
Knowing everybody lost somebody
I'm standing here in the cold, and
I gotta get myself back home, I'm
Looking like everybody
Knowing everybody lost somebody

[Bridge]
That I'm lost
Know that I'm lost
Lost in a world without you
Know that I'm lost
Know that I'm lost
Lost in a world without you

[Outro]
There's a reason I wake up alone in strange places
There's a reason I see myself in a million faces
There's a reason I can't stop it all from changing
There's a reason I can't stop it all from changing

There's a reason I wake up alone in strange places
There's a reason I see myself in a million faces
There's a reason I can't stop it all from changing
There's a reason I can't stop it all from changing

[Verse 1]
I saw you in a dream
You had stayed the same
You were beckoning me
Said that I had changed
Tried to keep my eyes closed
I want you so bad
Then I awoke and it was so sad

[Pre-Chorus]
Haven't talked to you in months
And I thought that I might cry
But I'm not that kind of girl

[Verse 2]
I saw you in a dream
You came to me
You were the sweetest apparition, such a pretty vision
There was no reason, no explanation
The perfect hallucination

[Pre-Chorus]
All good things come to an end
But I thought that this might last
But you came and left so fast

[Chorus]
When I'm awake I can't switch off
It isn't the same but it is enough

[Verse 3]
I saw you in a dream
Then it came to an end
I wonder if you'll come visit me again
You're taking your time to reappear
I'm starting to believe that when I call your name

[Pre-Chorus]
You just don't hear me anymore
And I know that I shouldn't even try
It's a waste of time

[Chorus]
When I'm awake I can't switch off
It isn't the same but it is enough
When I'm awake I can't switch off
It isn't the same but it is enough
It isn't the same but it is enough

[Spoken]
Ahem, ahem
Check, check, 1, 2, 1, 2
I'm comin' through okay, bruh?
Aight, I'm 'bout to do this lil' intro thing, aight
Ayo, what's up y'all? It's the kid, Mac Miller
That high school rapper y'all love
For a lot of y'all, this your first time meetin' me
And for a lot of y'all, y'all been listening for a lil' bit
I just wanna tell everybody this
This hip-hop shit right here, I live it
A hunnid percent point-blank motherfuckin' period
I ain't got no other options, I ain't got no backup plan
This is it for me
Everything I spit on the track, that's my life and how I see shit
So welcome to the motherfuckin' jukebox
Lay back in ya seat, spark a L, call your favorite shawty over, heh
We gon' have a good time
It's only gettin' better from here, Q, haha

[Verse 1]
People making lists, buying special gifts
Taking time to be kind to one and all
It's that time of year when good friends are near
And you wish you could give more than just presents from a store

[Chorus]
Why don't you give love on Christmas Day?
Oh, even the man who has everything
Would be so happy if you would bring
Him love on Christmas Day
No greater gift is there than love

[Verse 2]
People you don't know smile and nod hello
Everywhere there's an air of Christmas joy
It's that once of year, when the world's sincere
And you'd like to find a way to show the things that words can't say

[Chorus]
Why don't you give love on Christmas Day?
Oh, the man on the street and the couple upstairs
All need to know there's someone who cares
Give love on Christmas Day
No greater gift is there than love

[Bridge]
What the world needs is love
Yes, the world needs your love

[Chorus]
Why don't you give love on Christmas Day?
Oh, every little child on Santa's knee
Has room for your love underneath the tree
Give love on Christmas Day
Oh, no greater gift is there than love

What the world needs is love
Yes, the world needs your love
Why don't you give love on Christmas Day?
Oh, even the man who has everything
Would be so happy if you would bring
Him love on Christmas Day
No greater gift than love, love, love

[Outro]
Merry Christmas, baby

Fuckin' ride 'round in a limousine

Since a little dude, I would skip school
Man, I been fresh, but I had issues
In detention, I was pimpin', tell a bitch
Tell the teacher, tell the teacher, "Go and gimme kiss"
And I missed the quiz, man, I cheated on my mans

That we must be free
There is no joy in sorrow
No truth untold
And the cruel among us

Do you feel me?
Do you see me?
A voice keeps on telling me
That we've got to be
That we have to be
Free

Choppin' down a bitch, yeah, like you choppin' down a brick, yeah
Split with your clique, yeah, gon' split it with your clique, yeah
Lick a lil' clit, yeah, gon'a kiss a lil' clit, yeah
Kiss her titties, don't kiss her lips, don't come around with that trick shit
If you see the house I'm in, I'm always like Terry (It's mine)
Tall bitch and she black like a berry (Uh)
February birthday, boy, you scary (Ha)
Draped up in all white like the tooth fairy, yeah (Got wings too)
Got a brand new machete, yeah
Stab him up and leave that shit dirty, yeah
I was taught to fight for it if it's worth it, yeah
And I can't hang with them boys, they discouraged, yeah (Woo)
These niggas don't wanna die (These niggas don't wanna die)
These niggas scared of life (They scared of life)
Catch 'em like they running wild (Running wild)
Shoot 'em like hurry and die
She did it right, she did it right (Ooh, she did it right)
She like a Heaven in the sky (Angel)
Flood her down with some prizes (Flood her with some prizes)
Them the three steps before you wife her

[Chorus]
Let's go far away (Let's go far away)
Shit, we livin' it up, girl (We livin' it up)
I passed off a highway
I'ma leave the shade and come fuck up your world (Woo)
We can go far away, we can go far away
We goin' far away, we livin' it up, girl
I'm getting high all day, oh, oh, oh, oh
Fuck yeah (Fuck yeah), oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Intro]
(Wheezy Beats)
Thugger
I wanna give a shout out to my whole faculty
You know what I mean?
All my sisters and my brothers
My friends, my partners, my slimes, my girl, they girls
Appreciate y'all

[Chorus]
In 2000, I lost my motherfuckin' bro named Bennie (RIP Bennie)
And ever since then, I've been drinking color purple
No motherfuckin' Celie (lean, lean-lean-lean-lean)
I'm a fuckin power ranger
Got motherfuckin' magic, no motherfuckin' genie (Hey)
I ain't never had a reason
But a nigga banging red like a motherfuckin' demon (Blatt, blatt)
In 2009, I lost my motherfuckin' brother named Unfoonk
They gave my nigga life and ten, hey (What?)
I just spent fifty thousand dollars to help Troup, ooh (Woo)
But only God can help a sin

[Verse 1]
I think the realest shit come out a cup, just try your luck
Yes, I believe if you can get it in (And what?)
You can get stuck (Woo)
I think that pussy is the deepest end (Why?)
And I'm next up (Woah, woah)
I told her to come get her ends (Come on)
And leave them ducks (Fuck 'em, you don't need 'em)
You already know when she replied, yeah
She won't eat around me, she so shy, yeah
Put a T on her neck and that mean I tried, yeah
I'm not a human, but I have never died, yeah (I tried)
I got nine lives like a cat (Yeah)
I know hoes that like it in the crack (Swear)
I know niggas pushing them packs (Packs)
I know niggas countin' them racks (Racks)
I know niggas hit them bitch niggas (Yeah)
You can call them bitches gnats
I know bitches taking niggas jewelry in Vegas, gotta call them back
Yeah, that's their duty, just blame it on coochie
She don't got cooties, oh my God like Kooly
Every time we hit the movie, we make us a movie
And I keep two woolies, I don't trust nobody 'cause–

[Chorus]
In 2000, I lost my motherfuckin' bro named Bennie (RIP Bennie)
And ever since then, I've been drinking color purple
No motherfuckin' Celie (lean, lean-lean-lean-lean)
I'm a fuckin power ranger
Got motherfuckin' magic, no motherfuckin' genie (Hey)
I ain't never had a reason
But a nigga banging red like a motherfuckin' demon (Blatt, blatt)
In 2009, I lost my motherfuckin' brother named Unfoonk
They gave my nigga life and ten, hey (What?)
I just spent fifty thousand dollars to help Troup, ooh (Woo)
But only God can help a sin

[Verse 2]
These little niggas be bitches and hoes
These little niggas be bitches and hoes
These little niggas be bitches and hoes, wipe they nose
Been had checks nigga no four-four
A-wrist coat with some Timb's on my soles
Fish scale jumping out the bowls
Good hair can't stay in a bow
Control, control, more control
Ball on these pussy niggas like the po-po's
Money long, Pinocchio no-nose
And now they in a choke hold
Got a million dollars cash ridin' solo
Outta jail LV no bobos
Never mind these niggas, they loco

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
I cleaned out your dresser, found some joints
My sister smoked 'em, I didn’t see the point
And everyone keeps sayin' that I look just like you
Life don't seem so long anymore

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
The day my daddy died, I damn near quit the band
The day my daddy died, I held my mama’s hand
I cried my tears, then dried 'em up
Put my face inside my hands
The day my daddy died, I became a man

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
The cops came, they did not take off their shoes
People hug me, I smell like 10,000 perfumes
Gave away the wheelchair, you're gone, but I'm still here
January in Detroit is cold as fuck

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
The day my daddy died, I damn near quit the band
The day my daddy died, I held my mama's hand
I cried my tears, then dried 'em up
Put my face inside my hands
The day my daddy died, I became a man
The day my daddy died, I became a man

[Outro: Mike Posner & Jon Posner]
I love you a lot
I love you, too
Remind me to let you run away if you need to run places, like the basement. I mean, that's what it's a part of, isn’t it? Being an individual
Yeah, letting people go
Yeah
Remind me to let you go, too, if you need to
Absolutely
I love you
I love you so much. You’re gonna put that into a song?

[Verse 1]
Somebody told me God is simply what we don't know
Saw a butterfly, it was dead, but it was gorgeous
And all the robots are just walkin' down the sidewalk
Kings and their little empires that they made up

[Chorus]
And I'm wide open
And I'm wide open

[Verse 2]
Dusty got shot, and then Osha got married
Stewie still dead, and commitment still scary
I got a new woman, but I treat her like my old one
If I keep this shit up, I know I'ma be with no one

[Chorus]
And I'm wide open
Yeah, I'm wide open

[Verse 1]
I wish Tracy Chapman was my friend
She would know exactly what to say
Beginnings always hide themselves in ends
At some point, I will be okay

[Pre-Chorus]
I got high when I met you
I got high to forget you
I feel pain, I don't want to
But I have to, yeah, I have to

[Chorus]
If I want to move on, move on, move on, move on
If I want to move on, move on, move on, move on
If I want to move on (Move on), move on (Move on)
Move on (Move on), move on
If I want to move on (Move on), move on (Move on)
Move on (Move on), move on

[Verse 2]
Went to see some shaman in Malay
To hear some things I wanted to hear
Everyone just wants to feel good
Everyone just wants to disappear
Call up girls that live in my hometown
To help fill up the minutes
Lit a match and saged my house down
It didn't make a difference

[Pre-Chorus]
So I got high when I met you
I got high to forget you
I feel pain, I don't want to
But I have to, yeah, I have to

[Chorus]
If I want to move on, move on, move on, move on
If I want to move on, move on, move on, move on
If I want to move on (Move on), move on (Move on)
Move on (Move on), move on
I know I got to move on (Move on), move on (Move on)
Move on (Move on), move on

[Part 1]

[Intro]
Mwah

[Chorus]
Something's in the way
Oh, something in the way
I know who you are when no one's looking
Just by looking in your face

[Post-Chorus]
I'm liberated

[Bridge]
Our freedom never felt so jammin', baby

[Chorus]
Something's in the way
Oh, something in the way
I know who you are when no one's looking
Just by looking in your face

[Post-Chorus]
I'm liberated

[Part 2]

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Drip, drip, drip (Drip)
Drip, drip, drip (Drip)
Your eyes, your lies are gorgeous (Drip)
Your eyes, your lies are gorgeous

[Interlude: Mike Posner]
Avicii died, and little homie calls me up, and he's crying. (Drip) I told him, "I'ma be honest with you, if you don't get your shit together, you're next." And the truth is, by the time you hear this song, I don't fuckin' know if he's gon' be alive or not. This is all compounded by the fact that she and I do not speak anymore. I mean, am I the only one here who doesn't know what the fuck is going on? I worked the last ten years. I'm a multimillionaire. I'm thirty years old, it's supposed to all be good. It is not fucking all good. Fuck. And see, no one's really sure how long we were there for. Some say a few hours, others say a few years. All I know is a funny thing happens when you look in someone's eyes that long: you start to see their face unravel, you start to see their most beautiful and their most disgusting parts, you start to see that those are actually the same thing, you start to see them disappear, you start to see your mother, you start to see them, see you, you start to see tears, and you ain't sure who they belong to. Let 'em fall.

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Drip, drip, drip (Fuck, fuck, fuck, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip)
Drip, drip, drip (Fuck, fuck, fuck, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip)
Your eyes, your lies are gorgeous (Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip)
Your eyes, your lies are gorgeous (Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip)

[Outro: Mike Posner & Jon Posner]
Drip
Drip
Drip
I don't remember you ever running away another time from school classes, you must have. Do you?
Yeah
Did you get caught? What happened to you?
I feel like I'm always running away

[Verse 1]
I've always had trouble staying still
I stand next to what I hate just for the thrill
Spent the first quarter of my life on a million dollar bill
'Cause I can't stop staring at the fire
We got our crosses and our buildings, built 'em tall
And my book's another brick inside the wall
We sure make ourselves feel busy, but we don't do much at all
Except sit around and stare at the fire
And the protesters have gathered in the streets
Opposite, a block full of police
But they both have the same problem with God as you and me
It's that they can't stop staring at the fire

[Chorus]
Watch it burn, burn, burn
Watch it burn, burn, burn
Watch it burn, burn, burn
Watch it burn, burn, burn

[Verse 2]
Went to an ashram a million miles from here
An old man on a blanket appeared
He waved me to come closer, and he whispered in my ear
"Son, you've got to stop staring at the fire"
But all my ego trips come in flocks
And they tell me, "Kid, it's really not that hot"
Take your anxiety and your guilt, just throw it all on top
Now I can't stop standing in the fire

[Chorus]
Oh, watch me burn, burn, burn
Watch me burn, burn, burn
Watch me burn, burn, burn
Watch me burn, burn, burn
Oh, watch me burn, burn, burn
Watch me burn, burn, burn
Watch me burn, burn, burn
Watch me burn, burn, burn

[Intro]
People want to know (You, if you, if you, if you, if, if you, if)
People want to know (You, if you, if you, if you, if, if you, if)
People want to know (You, if you, if you, if you, if, if you, if)
People want to know (You, if you, if you, if you, if, if you, if)

[Chorus]
If you ever get tired being perfect
Do you ever get tired being perfect?

[Verse 1]
I got on a flight, the plane's brand new
We can make it to New York in an hour or two
Look down on the city from heights high as these
Everything's perfect
And my friend tells me that I'm too nice
Her voice trails off, I know she wants advice
I recycle some quote I heard Dillon write
It's that everything's perfect

[Bridge]
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)

[Verse 2]
When I wake up before you and just watch you sleep, that's
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
And you tell me later you were dreaming of me
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
When I walk down the street and the trees know my name
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
People I don't know around an open flame, that's
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
A grandmother's fingers around a granddaughter's hand
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
People speaking languages that I don't understand (That's)
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
When you stare into my eyes and I'm thinking you're the one that's
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
When my mama tells me that she's proud of what I've done
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
When the winter ends in the city that I'm from (That's)
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
When I open up and get hurt by someone (That's)
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
When you trust somebody and they don't let you down (That's)
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
When somebody you love dies, but you still feel 'em around

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Do you ever get tired (Oh, yeah)
Of being perfect?
(Can you feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it? Yeah)
Do you ever get tired (Oh, yeah)
Of being perfect?

[Skit: Mike Posner & Jon Posner]
Alright man
One more
And then I'm out
And then last one
You want another song?
Nn-mm
Okay
I-I would like another song
Alright
I'll blow you a kiss from across the room
I’ll let it miss so you don't assume
Please tell me that you want me, you need me
Doesn't matter if you don’t believe me
I have no one to call me baby
Sure is sad no one calls you lately
I try to run but I don't know how to get there
Keep on running you're going nowhere

You fear the sunrise, you can dry your eyes, your crocodile tears

I just need a man who will stay
You can save it for a rainy day
Won't you help me get my life on track?
I'd oblige but you stabbed me in back
Ride with me, I'm headed south
I can't believe a single word from your mouth
You and me are like biscuits and gravy
Now I know that you're crazy

You fear the sunrise, you can dry your eyes, your crocodile tears
Can’t believe a word you say
You can save it for a rainy day
Had to tell you not once, but twice
You need to take your own advice
Keep yourself alive, keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and a money
And honey you'll survive

Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave

Keep yourself alive, keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive

Keep yourself alive, keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive

Keep yourself alive, come on, come on
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive

(Roger: Yeah, thank you)

(Freddie: Thank you very much. Tell you what we do right now, this is a, our current release, thank you, it's called, he's announced it for me, the 'Seven Seas Of Rhye')

[Freddie: So one, two, three, four]

I live my life for you
Think all my thoughts with you
And only you ...
Anything you ask I do, for you

I touch your lips with mine
But in the end
I leave it to the lords
Leave it in the lap of the gods

(instrumental segue)

I want you to ...
Leave it in the lap of the gods
Leave it in the lap of the gods
Leave it in the lap of the gods

Lap of the gods
Ah, ah, ah, uh-ahh
Lap of the gods
Ah, ah, ah, ahh

Lap of the gods
Aah, ah, ah, uh-ahh

In the lap of the gods
Ah, ah, ah, ah

In the lap of the gods

The lap of the gods ...

[Verse 1]
She keeps a Moët et Chandon in her pretty cabinet
"Let them eat cake," she says, just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy for Khrushchev and Kennedy
At anytime an invitation, you can't decline
Caviar and cigarettes, well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

[Chorus]
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Anytime)
Recommended at the price
Insatiable in appetite
Wanna try?

(Guitar solo segue ending as a medley bridge to next track, verses from "The March of the Black Queen")
I rule with my left hand
I rule with my right

I'm lord of all darkness, I'm queen of the night
I've got the power:
Now do The March of the Black Queen

My life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie
I'll be what you make me, I'll do what you like
I'll be your bad boy, I'll be your bad boy
Now do The March of the Black Queen
Yeah, yeah, Oh-Ohhh, yeah
My cutie pie

(instrumental, various-solos: guitar, piano, bass, banjo)

Doo-beh-doo-bah
Doo-beh-doo-bah
(doo-beh-doo-bah)
Bring back
Bring-that-Big-Bad-Leroy-back
I want him back
(Roger) Yeah

Brian: Thanks a lot...

Freddie:  Thank you
Were you expecting that?
That was, that was new for both you and us
Right now ...
(audience shouts "Liar!")
No, no, no, nah; listen my darlings, (ha heh heh-heh) you seem to know the show better than we do!
No 'Liar' doesn't come right now, there's something else from the first album, do you remember that one? ...

Oh Mr. Jackson, why?
Yeah every time I come around your here
Your daughter in my car
But your voice, my ear

You head outside the door
Been there all year

I don't want to go home
We can drive up in my mom's car all night
Don't wanna take you back home
I'm so tired of being alone

It's gettin' dark outside
Almost twelve o'clock
But it feels like two
I can't see your face
But I feel you
Everything is new
With you
I don't want to go home
We can drive up in my mom's car all night
Don't wanna take you back home
I'm so tired of being alone

Found somebody to share the night with
Fill up the void in my heart quick
In my heart quick

Found somebody to share the night with
Fill up the void in my heart quick

[Intro]
(Thank you)
(Next)
(Thank you)
(Next)

[Verse 1]
Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
One taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
Look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (ooh)
I'm so grateful for my-
Thank you, next (ooh)
I'm so grateful for my-

[Verse 2]
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that

[Pre-Chorus]
She taught me love
She taught me patience
She handles pain
That shit's amazing
I've loved and I've lost
That's not what I see
Look what I found
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (ooh)
I'm so grateful for my-
Thank you, next (ooh)
I'm so grateful for-

[Bridge]
One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash

[Pre-Chorus]
Love
Got so much patience
Learned from my pain
And I turned out amazing (Turned out amazing)
I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
Look what I've found (hey)
Ain't no need for searching
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (ooh)
I'm so grateful for my-
Thank you, next (ooh)
I'm so grateful for my-
Thank you, next (ooh)
I'm so grateful for my-
Thank you, next (ooh)
I'm so grateful for-

[Outro]
Aah, aah, aah, aah

[Verse 1]
When I'm standing in the sun
I never really stop to think and miss someone
But when I lose that light
Blue skies at night

[Verse 2]
When those evening stars shine down
I suddenly remember that you're not around
And I face that fight
Blue skies at night

[Chorus]
These are the hardest kind of years
The ones where people disappear
So tired of all these broken dreams
I'm better on my own it seems

[Verse 3]
Dog in a ball at the end of my bed
Yet, I wish it was the three of us in yours instead
But I do what's right
Blue skies at night

[Chorus]
These are the hardest kind of years
The ones where people disappear
Who's crying all these winter tears?
They're hanging like this chandelier

[Outro]
And there beside the morning grave
A stronger man in place of where a fool once laid
But for one more day
Blue skies
So come what may
Blue skies
I'll find my way
Blue skies at night

[RINGLEADER]
Shouldn't there be a place where nothing is naughty?
Shouldn’t there be a place where anything goes?
Where "shouldn't" and "can't" and "don’t"
And "mustn't" and "ought" evaporate
And fun's the only biz? Guess what!

[RINGLEADER/wRoustabouts]
There is!

Candy, cake, and pie " land

Or a chore to do

Kiss goodbye-land (Mwah!)

Gonna crack a rib when I get home
I'm gonna bury you in my favorite hole
I made a bloody mess in the kitchen sink
I tried to fix myself but I didn't think

[Pre-Chorus]
They said "We just want to talk with you"
"We just want to walk you through" oh

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't want to see
Me, I wanna be trapped in you
Oh, I don't want to be
Me but I'm gonna pretend for you, oh

[Verse 2]
Let's paint our nails and keep it real
'Cause honey all I know is what I feel
I'm still looking for a friend of a friend
He said he'd hook me up, he told me what he had

[Bridge]
They say "Leave your body, leave your mind
Don't you know you're out of time?"

[Verse 3]
In his room, in his bed
You can't hear what he said
Looks like dirt, tastes like trash
Honey, I know you could float right back, oh

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't want to see
Me, I wanna be trapped in you
Oh, I don't want to be
Me but I'm gonna pretend for you, oh

[Part I]

[Verse 1: Devonté Hynes]
Fading these figures I'm instrumental
Waiting for something to implement if I'm not supposed to be here then I'm wasted at 32
And I couldn’t even prepare for the loss what could I do but cry?
Tried to figure it out processes way too long and I'm running out of time and I'm smoking one for my boy and I-

[Part II]

[Chorus: Yves Tumor]
Kept you waiting
I graduated
Up out my feelings
I'm glad you made it
You saw I can do it
So you've been waiting
I'm glad you made it
So glad you made it
Kept you waiting
I graduated
About my feelings
I'm glad you made it
You saw I can do it
So you've been waiting
I'm glad you made it
So glad you made it

[Verse 2: Yves Tumor]
Have you ever lost somebody?
Felt so helpless?
Have you ever been so empty?
Have you ever run away?
Have you ever acted selfish?
Had to look the other way
I've never seen you act this headless
Have you ever missed something?
So close but can't explain it?
Had to look the other way
I've never seen you act this headless

[Chorus: Yves Tumor]
Kept you waiting
I graduated
About my feelings
You saw I can do it
So you've been waiting
I'm glad you made it

About my feelings
I'm glad you made it
You're so shit together
So you've been waiting
I'm glad you made it
So glad you made it

[Verse 3: Yves Tumor, Ian Isiah]
The sun comes in my heart fulfils within
The sun comes in my heart fulfils within
(Have you ever run away?
Have you ever acted selfish?
Had to look the other way
I've never seen you act this headless)
Have you ever missed something?
So close but can't explain it?
Had to look the other way
I've never seen you act this headless
Have you ever lost somebody?
Felt so helpless?
Have you ever been so guilty?
Have you ever run away?
Have you ever acted selfish?
Had to look the other way
I've never seen you act this headless
Have you ever missed some thing?
So close but can't explain it?
Had to look the other way

[Verse 4: Devonté Hynes + Ian Isiah]
Fading these figures I'm instrumental
Waiting for something to implement if I'm not supposed to be here then I'm wasted at 32
And I couldn’t even prepare for the loss what could I do but cry?
Tried to figure it out processes way too long and I'm running out of time and I'm smoking one for my boy and I'm thinking about the tracks that I never got to respond in the day that I maxed out
You invited me over and I was overcome with feelings of being done but wanted to waste my time but when I look back sit back and take back with my regret RIP my boy Mac and
Got nothing left to say
Please don't take it the wrong way
The sun comes in my heart fulfils within
The sun comes in my heart fulfils within

Boy you never come to check on me, so no check for you (Cha-ching)

Used to have a heart for you but its got left in two

Catching trains to the city, we don't do no tap
Kenny boy keep the flip phone but he don't do trap (Nah, nah, nah, nah)
Moving from the country, what a change
Now mama flipping bands just for the change
Hiding my report card full of grades
But now I can't be tamed, when I realize that this world is for the take
Yeah hol' up wait, (Give me that shit, give me that shit)

[Verse 3]
Give me space, give me time
Give my fate, through the lines
Make me great, I'm gon' shine either way, can't deny
Time that I spent, the rhymes that I checked
My drive, my attempts
My trials, my success (Ooh)
I talk to like I'm grown but I'm a child
Let them take an inch, they took a mile
They try cramp the style
The boy still looking pretty with the smile
Keep it one hundred times three like 

[kefalas?] oh my god

[Chorus]
(No, ayy)
I'm the only one that can stop me (Ayy)
The light of day is something you won't see (Ayy)

Ain't it finally they'll get what I mean
(Know what I mean, ayy, know what I mean uh)

[Outro]

Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell

[Chorus]
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told "a tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
If I–
If I–

[Verse 2]
Hands getting cold
Losing feeling's getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break

[Chorus]
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told "a tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
If I–
If I–

But you miss me, told me come back home
And you don't really like to sleep alone

When the shit get weird, we could switch up gears
I wanna see them lips, kissin' ear to ear
I wanna hear your song
Ohh, I wanna feel just how you feel
Touch it one more time so I know you're real
We could spin that wheel, wouldn't you rather get along?

[Chorus]
Until, until there is no longer
Let's get lost inside the clouds
And you, you don't gotta work harder

A word in your ear
From father to son
Hear the word that I say
I fought with you
Fought on your side
Long before you were born
Kings will be crowned
The word goes around
Father to son, to son

Every now and again
Time after time I keep a calling you
Warning you on your way, yes
Don't destroy what you see
Your country to be
Just keep building on the ground that’s been won
Kings will be crowned

Oooh, oooh
A word in your ear

Funny you don't hear a single word I say
But my letter to you
Will stay by your side
Through the years, though the loneliness has gone

Sing if you will
But the air you breathe
I live to give you
Father to son
Father to, father to
Father to son

Freddie: "Thank you; thank you... lovelies.  Good evening; ooh!  So you've all come out in force -- How'r you feeling? I think I've seen most of you before; in fact, I've seen nearly all of you before, ha, ha, ha, we'd like to do something from our ’Queen II’ album now, would you like (that)? Yes, you would, it's a number entitled...
(Freddie: called "Keep Yourself Alive")

Ahh

Yeah
Keep yourself alive
Get down
Yeah

I was told a million times
Of all the troubles in my way
Might he grow a little wiser
Little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile
Sold a million mirrors
In a shop in alleyway
But I never saw my face
In any window any day
Now they say your folks
Are telling you, be a superstar
Tell you just be satisfied
And stay right where you are
Keep yourself alive, keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive

That's right
That's right
Wow

Well I loved a million women
In a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners
Brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need
Feed my body and my soul
Grow a little bigger
Maybe that can be my goal
Told a million times
Of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying
And get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
Rode a million miles
Still be where I started
Same as when I started

Keep yourself alive, keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
(Freddie ...Ogre Battle:)

Ah, come on

Huah, Huah, Huah, Huah, Haaah!
Now once upon a time
An old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone
And the soup is cold on your table
And if the black crow flies to
Find a new destination
That is the sign
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to ogre battle fight

Freddie: What do you think of the show so far?

He gives a great big cry
Swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue, he catches flies
The palm of a hand incredible size
Great big eye
Has a focus in your direction
And the battle is won
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to ogre battle fight
Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Haaah!
Hit it ...

The ogre men are still inside
The two-way mirror mountain
You gotta stay clear and out of sight
You can't see in but you can see out
Keep a lookout
The ogre men are coming out
Two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind
And they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cause you gotta go south

(Brian!)
(guitar solo)

Ogre men are comin' home
And then the great big fight is over
Bugle blow let trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives forevermore
Oh, oh, oh
Yes you can come along
You can come along
Come to Ogre Battle
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Haaah!

(spoken)
Freddie: Nice one. Thank you

Roger: Yeah, that's really nice of you

Freddie: Thank you; thank you very much
How are you lot doing down there?
All there, they're all awake
How would you like if we did something from the first album?
I knew you'd dig that; which one would you like? (Audience: 'Liar'!?). I tell you what, I knew I asked for that one; this one's called 'Son And Daughter'
(Brian: Three, four)

I want you
So watch out

Tried to be your son and daughter
Rolled into one; yes I did

You said you'd equal any man
For having your fun

Ooh, now didn't you feel surprised to find
The cap just didn't fit?
A woman expects a man
To buckle down and a shovel...
What'll you do for loving
If it's the one and the only game, yeah

I want you
To be a woman, yeah
Yeah
Well I tried to be a preacher
And a fisher of men

An equal people-preacher
Will you lead us all the same

Well I traveled all 'round
The world and found
A brand new word for "day"
Watching the time
Never linger behind
Pardon me, I have to get away
What'll you do for heaven
If it's a back from where you came, yeah

I want you

(Freddie: What comes next?)
To be a woman
I want you to be a woman
Oh, dig it
Ooh, yeah

Now didn't you feel surprised to find
The cap just didn't fit
A woman expects a man
To buckle down and a shovel it
What'll you do for heaven
If it's a back from where you came?

I want you to be a woman
A woman, let's hear ...

(Freddie: Thank you. How nice
Lovely, lovely, ha, ha, ha
I see you're getting warmed up: nice ...

Roger: Ah, OK we'd like to something a little quieter now, this is a song written by Brian May.  It's on the second album, featuring Mr. Mercury on piano I think, it's called 'White Queen' ...)
So sad her eyes
Smiling dark eyes
So sad her eyes
As it began

On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone
And all around the air did say
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known:
The White Queen walks and the night grows pale
Stars of lovingness in her hair

Needing, unheard
Pleading, one word
So sad, her eyes
She cannot see

How did thee fare, what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And 'neath the window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came
White Queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no words could make
Still, I wait
(guitar and piano solos)

My goddess hear, my darkest fear
It's not too late
It's forevermore that I wait

Dear friend, goodbye
No tears, (in) my eyes
So sad, it ends
As it began

(Freddie: Thank you

Roger: Thanks, thanks for listening

Freddie: Ha, ha, ha-- I'll tell you what, how, how
Would you like to know about a dirty old man that I know about?Ha, ha, ha, do you know what he's called?
He's called 'Great King Rat' ...)
Great King Rat died today
Born on the 21st of May
Died syphilis 44 on his birthday

Every second word he swore
Yes, he was the son of a whore
Always wanted by the law

Now would you like to know
A wouldn't you like to know
A wouldn't you like to know
Great king rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?
Ow

Where will I be tomorrow
Will I beg, will I borrow
I don't care anyway
Come on, come on, the time is right
The man is evil and that is right
I told you
And that's no lie
Would you like to know
A wouldn't you like to know
A wouldn't you like to know
Great king rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?
Let him show you, ha

Ooh yeah

Now would you like to know
A wouldn't you like to know
People:
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now, what did I tell you
Would you like to see?

Hit it
You bugger you

Now listen, all you people
Throw out the good and keep the bad
Very soon you're gonna be in the bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
And very soon you're gonna be a disciple
Don't listen to what your mama says
Not a word, not a word mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival, sure
The great Lord before he died
Knelt sinners by his side
Said 'you're going to realize tomorrow'

No, I'm not gonna tell you
What you already know
'cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come on, come on the time is right
This evil man will fight
I told you once before
Yes, and that's no lie

Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?

(Freddie: Thank you

Brian: Hope you like our new arrangement

Freddie: Do you know, they didn't give me enough time to change, the nasty ones
Brian: We'd now like to do something for you, which we don't often do; it's especially for you, which is off the second album, features Freddie on the jangle box again, it's called
'The Fairy Feller's Masterstroke')
Ahhh, ahhh, ahh
Ah-ah

Fairy folk have gathered 'round
The new moonshine
See the feller crack-a-nut
At night's noon-time
Axe he swears
'cause he climbs he dare
To deliver

Ploughman 'Waggoner Will' and types
Politician with senatorial pipe
Dally-oh
Pedagogue squinting wears a frown
And a satyr peers under lady's gown
What a dirty lad-io

Tatterdemalion and a junketer
There's a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter
Hero
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy
Of his lady friend...
In yellow
What a quaere fellow...

(Instrumental bridge/piano-guitar solo)

Soldier, sailor, tinker, tailor, ploughboy
Waiting to hear the sound
And the arch-magician presides
He is the leader

Oberon and Titania watched by a harridan
Mab is the queen
And there's a good apothecary man
Come to say hello
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy
Of his lady friend

In yellow
What a quaere fellow ...

The ostler stares with hands on his knees
Come on Mr. Feller
Crack it open if you please
Ahhhh, ahh ...
(drumroll Coda)
(Roger: Thank you

Freddie:  Tell you what, it's time you all joined in, everybody, and I know you know the words to this one, all you gotta do is clap along, sing along the choruses, it's called ...)
Fear me you Lords and Lady preachers
I descend upon your earth from the skies
I command your very souls, you unbelievers:
Bring before me what is mine
The Seven Seas of Rhye

Can you hear me you peers and privy councilors
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust
I swear that you'll be mine
The Seven Seas of Rhye

Sister - I live and lie for you
Mister - Do and I’ll die
You are mine, I possess you
Belong to you forever, ever, ever

(guitar solo)

Storm the master marathon I'll fly through
By flash and thunder fire I'll survive (I’ll survive, I'll survive)
Then I'll defy the laws of nature
And come out alive
Then I'll get you
Be gone with you, you shod and shady senators
Give out the good, leave out the bad evil cries
I challenge the mighty Titan and his troubadours
And with a smile
I'll take you to The Seven Seas of Rhye

Ooh yeah
Come on let me take you
Come on let me take you
Seven Seas of Rhye alright

(Freddie: Thank you.  Ahh
How would you like some rock 'n' roll? Some rock and roll?
Ha, ha, ha; thought you didn't hear me the first time
This is ’Modern Times Rock ’n' Roll’ ...)
Yeah

Got to make do with a worn out rock & roll scene
The old bop is getting tired
Don't you know
Well you know what I mean?
Fifty-eight that was great
But it's over now, that's all
Something harder's coming up
Gonna knock a hole in the wall
Gonna grab you, hit you hard
Make you feel ten feet tall ...

Well I hope that a brand new baby's gonna come along soon
And I know it could happen
Any old rainy afternoon
With the jukebox blowing
Jukebox blowing no fuse
And the temperature's like
Just like a Sunday-school cruise
And you know everybody in this world could use
Modern times - rock 'n' roll
Modern times - rock 'n' roll, yeah

Ooh

Get your high heeled guitar styled boots
And groovy clothes
Get a hairpiece on your chest
A ring through your nose
Find a nice little man
Who's gonna make you a big, big star
Stars in your eyes, ants in your pants
You gotta go far
And you know everybody
In this bum sucking world should go far

Rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll
(Rock 'n' roll)
You move it the left, you move it the right
(Rock 'n' roll)
Groovin' and shakin' all of the night
(Rock 'n') roll
Rock 'n' roll, ow
Rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll
Freddie: Thank you
Roger: One more? Oh
The warden threw a party in the county jail
Prison band was there and they began to wail
Band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing
Should've heard them knocked out jailbirds sing
Let's rock
Everybody let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Dancing to the jailhouse rock

Number forty-seven said to number three
You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
Sure would be delighted in your company
Come on and do the jailhouse rock with me
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Dancin' to the jailhouse rock

Well, Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowing on his slide trombone
Drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
Whole rhythm section was the purple gang
Let's rock, everybody, let's rockin' and a-rollin' tonight
Everybody in the whole cell block
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
(guitar solo)
One more time

Stupid Cupid, you're a real mean guy
Woman, woman, oh mah you can fly
Ooh, it's a crying shame
Stupid stop playing that game
Hey, hey, set me free
Stupid stop ah-aw

Be-bop a lula - you're shooting my baby
Be-bop a lula - she's driving me crazy
Be-bop a lula - she don't understand
Be-bop a lula - don't a play that game
You've got a rocker, you've got a roller
You've gotta be my baby, baby, baby, ooh

One more time

Well, sad sack sittin' on a block of stone
Way in the corner weepin' all alone
Don't you tell nobody, don't you be no square
Can't find a partner use a wooden chair

Let's rock, everybody let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
We've gone dancing to the jailhouse rock
Gone dancing to the jailhouse rock
Dancing
Dancing
Let me hear you do it
Yeah
You clapping up there?

They've got a boogie
They gotta roll
They've got a-shake it
Hot and cold

They've got a boogie
You're doing well

Just do it for the jailhouse rock
Get dancin' to the jailhouse rock
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Gone dancing to the jailhouse rock

You've got 'em dancing to the jailhouse rock
Dancin' to the jailhouse rock

Dancin' to the jailhouse rock
Dancin' to the jailhouse rock
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
(Freddie: Thank you. We'd like to end, we'd like to end with the number we usually end with, for those who've seen us, it's called 'Liar')
Alright

Ahhh

Oooh

I have sinned dear Father
Father I have sinned
Try and help me father
Won't you let me in?
Liar, oh nobody believes me
Liar, why don't you leave me

Sire, I have stolen
Stolen many times
Raised my voice in anger
When I know I never should
Liar, oh everybody deceives me
Liar, why don't you leave me alone

Brian
Liar, I have sailed the seas
Liar, I have drunk the wine
Liar, time after time
Liar, you're lying to me
Liar, yes, you're lying to me

Father, please forgive me
You know you'll never leave me
Please will you direct me
In the right way
In the right way
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Liar, liar, liar, liar, everybody
Liar, every day and every night
Liar, all the time
Liar, oh, oh-woh-woh
They keep calling me liar
They know I'm a liar
And that's the way to go

Move over baby

Keep on

Listen
Now you're gonna listen
Ooh, yeah
Mama I'm gonna be your slave (all day long)
Mama I'm gonna try behave (all day long)
Mama I'm gonna be your slave (all day long)

I'm gonna kneel down by your side and pray
All day long, all day long, all day long

Liar, liar, they never ever let you win
Liar, liar, everything you do is sin
Liar, nobody believes you
Liar, they bring you down before you begin
Now let me tell you this
So now you know you could be dead
Before they let you ...

(Freddie: Thank you, thank you very much, good night, thank you!
'See What A Fool I've Been' ...)
Well she's gone
Gone this morning
See what a fool I've been
Oh Lord, I said
What a fool I've been
Watch out

I caught a train
A train to Georgia
Sixteen coaches long
Oh Lord, I said
Sixteen coaches long, yeah

Dog ain't too hungry
He just kept on barking, wow, wow
He said, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh Lord I said
He just, feel the same

Brian; Your turn

Come on out, come on out
Oh
Ooh
Oooh, ooh, ooh

Well I get so lonely
Went and told my neighbour
And she said ooh-ooh-oohhh
Oh Lord, I said
What a fool I've been
Then she told me what to do
She said go home

Ooh, more, baby

Well she's gone
Gone this morning
See what a fool I've been, oh lord I said
What a
Fo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oool
Freddie: Lovely darlings, thank you
I've been

(Freddie: Thank you very much)
Here I stand
Look around, around, around, around, around
But you won't see me

Now I'm here
Now I'm there
I'm just a
Just a new man
Yes, you made me live again

A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright
The people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight

Whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be
Don't worry baby I'm safe and sound
Down in the dungeon just Peaches 'n' me
Don't I love you him so
Yes, you made me live again
Yeah
Ooh, a thin moon me in a smoke screen sky
Where the beams of your lovelight chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With the rain running down my face
Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye
Down in the city just Hoople 'n' me

Don't I love him so

Whatever comes of you and me
I love to leave my memory with you

Now I'm here
Think I'll stay around, around, around, around
Down in the city justa you 'n' me

(Freddie: Thank you, thank you, the nasty Queenies are back - what d'you think of that? Thank you very much, it's really, it really is nice to be back home. And it's been, it's been so long we've missed you all, we really have. Have you missed us?)
Freddie: it's time for "Ogre Battle"

Ah, ah, ah, Huh, Haaah!
Now once upon a time
An old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone
And the soup is cold on your table
And if the black crow flies to
Find a new destination
That is the sign
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to ogre battle fight

He gives a great big cry
Swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue, he catches flies
The palm of a hand incredible size
Great big eye
Has a focus in your direction
And the battle is won
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to ogre battle fight
Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Haaah!
Hit it ...

The ogre men are still inside
The two-way mirror mountain
You gotta stay clear and out of sight
You can't see in but you can see out
Keep a GOOD lookout ...

The ogre men are coming out
Two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind
And they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cause you gotta go sout
(guitar solo)

Ogre men are comin' home
And then the great big fight is over
Bugle blow let trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives forevermore
Oh, oh, oh
Yes you can come along
You can come along
Come to Ogre Battle

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Haaah!
(spoken)
Freddie: Thank you, thank you, you lovely darlings. Have you all got your black fingernails? And who's got the white ones? They all seem to be over there. Tell you what, right now, we'd like to carry on with something else from 'Queen II', would you like that?   Freddie: Nice one. Thank you
(Freddie, spoken: So this one's called 'Father To Son')

A word in your ear
From father to son
Hear the word that I say

I fought with you
Fought on your side
Long before you were born

Kings will be crowned
The word goes around
Father to son, to son

And the voice is so clear
Time after time
I keep on calling you, calling you on
Don't destroy what you see
Your country to be
Just keep building on the ground that's been won
Kings will be crowned
The word goes around
Father to son, to son
Yes

Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do
Our family song

Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do ooh, yeah

Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do

Let me move along, along, along, ooh

Take this letter that I give you
Take it sonny, hold it high
You won't understand a word that's in it
But you'll write it out again before you die
Oooh, yeah
Oooh, oooh

To-da, to-da, to-da, oh yeah
I want to write you out a letter

Oooh, oooh

A word in your ear
From father to son
Funny you don't hear a single word I say
But my letter to you will stay by your side
Through the years
Though the loneliness has gone

Sing if you will
But the air you breathe I live to give you
Father to son
Father to, father to, father to son

(Freddie: Nice, thank you. Thank you very much. Uhm, right now we'd like to do a little sad song.  Oh yes: so I hope you've got all your handkerchiefs out)
(Freddie: This is a number from 'Queen II', written by Brian May, 'White Queen')

So sad, her eyes
Smiling dark eyes
So sad, her eyes
As it began

On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone
And all around the air did say
My lady soon stir this way
In sorrow known

The White Queen walks and the night grows pale
Stars of lovingness in her hair

Needing - unheard
Pleading - one word
So sad her eyes
She cannot see
How did thee fare, what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And 'neath the window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came
White Queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no words can make
Still, I wait

My Goddess hear, my darkest fear:
I speak too late
It's for Evermore that I wait

Dear friends, goodbye
No tears (in) my eyes
So sad, it ends
As it began ...

(Brian: Thanks a lot, thank you. Thanks a lot, thanks a lot, it's nice to see you all again tonight, makes the Rainbow feel like home for us, great. We've narrowly, narrowly escaped having a number one single this week, ah, and this is the side which you haven't been hearing on the Tony Blackburn show ...)
Brian: It's called 'Flick Of The Wrist', thank you

Dislocate your spine if you don't sign he says
I'll have you seeing double, double
Mesmerize you when he's tongue-tied
Simply with those eyes
Synchronize your minds and see
The beast within him rise ...

Don't look back;
Don't look back

Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist - he'll eat your heart out
Dig in the ribs, and then a kick in the head
Taken an arm, taken a leg...
All this time honey
Baby, you've been had

Intoxicate your brain with what I'm saying
If not you'll lie in knee-deep trouble
"Prostitute yourself", he says
Castrate your human pride
Sacrifice your leisure days
Let me squeeze you 'til you've dried
Don't look back;
Don't look back:
It's a rip off

(instrumental/guitar & piano solo)

Work my fingers to my bones
Scream with pain
Still make no impression

Seduce you with his money-make- machine
Cross-collateralize
Reduce you to a muzak fake machine
And then the last goodbye, bye, bye, bye

Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist - he'll eat your heart out
Dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
Taken an arm, taken a leg
All this time honey
Baby, you've been had

(Roger: Tah, good job ...

Freddie: Thank you, thank you
Now then, ha, ha, ha, well your guess is right
Right now we'd like to do something new for you actually, it's about four pieces that we've put together, a sort of a medley, uhm, three of them are on our new album 'Sheer Heart Attack', thank you, which is now racing up the charts, thanks to you...)
(Freddie: This is a number called 'Son And Daughter')

I want you
So watch out

Tried to be your son and daughter
Rolled into one, yes I did
You said you'd equal any man
For having your fun

Ooh, now didn't you feel surprised to find
The cap just didn't fit
A woman expects a man
To buckle down and a shovel
What'll you do for loving
If it's only just begun, yeah

I want you
To be a woman

Well I tried to be a preacher
And a fisher of men
An equal people preacher
Will you lead us all the same
Well I travelled all round
The world and found
A brand new word for day
Watching the time
Never linger behind
Pardon me, I have to get away
What'll you do for heaven
If it's back from where you came
Listen:
I want you
Freddie: And then what? What's that?
To be a woman
I want you to be a woman
Now didn't you feel surprised to find
The cap just didn't fit
A woman expects a man
To buckle down and a shovel
What'll you do for loving
If it's only just begun, yeah

I want you
To be a woman
A woman

(Freddie: Thank you, thank you very much, featuring Brian May on guitar. It's really nice to have him back after his illness, really is, and he hasn't joined anybody else. Right now we'd like to do a number written by Brian when he was a little teenage boy, do you know what that one is? It's a little message to all of you that have come here tonight, all it says is 'Keep Yourself Alive'. . . )
That's right, come on
Just you, keep yourself alive

I was told a million times
Of all the troubles in my way
Might he grow a little wiser
Little better every day

But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile

Sold a million mirrors in a shop-in alleyway
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you, 'be a superstar'
Tell you just be satisfied, stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive, keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Shake
Well I loved a million women
In a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners
Brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need
Feed my body and my soul

Then I'll grow a bigger, maybe that can be my goal
Told a million times of all the people in my way
How I'd have to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers, and I rode a million miles
Still be where I started, same as when I started

Keep yourself alive, keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
('Reprise' opens with guitar bridging Roger's previous extended 51-second drum solo tracked individually, prior to this track.)

Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive

Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave (Roger: Ow)

Come on and keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive

Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive, come on, come on
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive!

Freddie: Thank you
Roger: Thank you, we'd like to feature for you now, commonly referred to in the press as Mr two-fingered Freddie Mercury, using all ten fingers tonight, we hope you're gonna enjoy this, it's a good one this, it's really loud, you know, it's alright, appeals to the lower elements such as myself
Roger: This one's called the 'Seven Seas Of Rhye'

Fear me you Lords and Lady preachers:
I descend upon your earth from the skies
I command your very souls you unbelievers
Bring before me what is mine
The Seven Seas of Rhye

Can you hear me you peers and privy councilors
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man dares abuse my trust
I swear that you'll be mine
The Seven Seas of Rhye

Sister - I live and lie for you
Mister - do and I'll die
You are mine
I possess you
Belong to you forever, ever, ever, (Ahhhh!)

Storm the master marathon I'll fly through
By flash and thunder fire and I'll survive (I'll survive, I'll survive)
Then I'll defy the laws of nature
Come out alive
Then I'll get you!
Be gone with you, you shod and shady senators
Give out the good, leave out the bad evil cries
I challenge the mighty Titan and his troubadours
And with a smile
I'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye

Come on, let me take you
Come on, let me take you
The Seven Seas of Rhye

Freddie: Thank you. Thank you
Thank you very much
Do you like my claws? They're real diamonds
It's a present from the devil himself. You don't believe me? They don't believe me! Right now we'd like to do some rock 'n' roll, a la Queen ...
(Freddie: I tell you what, this is a number from the 'Sheer Heart Attack’ album, 'Stone Cold Crazy')

(Roger: A one, two, three, four, a, one, two, three, four)

Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning
I was dreaming I was Al Capone
There’s a rumor going  'round, gotta clear outta town
Yeah, I'm smelling like a dry fish bone
Here come the law, gonna break down the door
Gonna carry me away once more
Never, I never, I never get it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know

Ow

Rainy afternoon I gotta blow a typhoon and I'm playing on my slide trombone
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know
Watch-a
Walking down the street, shooting people that I meet
With my rubber- tommy water gun
Here come the deputy, he's gonna come and getta me
I gotta get me get up and run
They got the sirens loose
I ran right outta juice
They're gonna put me in a cell, if you can't go to heaven
Would you let me go to hell
Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know

Freddie: Thank you, thank you dears. Now then, we've come to a point in time, we’d like to do (audience shout ’Liar') a number that was released, oh they know it, might as well get on with it, it’s a number released in the States as a single ...
Freddie: It's a number called 'Liar'

I have sinned, Dear Father
Father, I have sinned
Try and help me Father
Won't you let me in?

Liar! Ohh nobody believes me
Liar! Why don't you leave me?

Sire, I have stolen
Stolen many times
Raised my voice in anger
When I know I never should

Liar!  Oh everybody deceives me
Liar!  Why don't you leave me alone

Liar!  I have sailed the seas
Liar!  from Mars to Mercury
Liar!  I have drunk the wine
Liar!  time after time
Liar!  You're lying to me
Liar, yes, you're lying to me
Father, please forgive me
You know you'll never leave me
Please will you direct me
In the right way
In the right way
The right, oh right-ah-way

Liar, Liar, Liar
Liar!

Liar! that's what they call me
Liar! every day and every night
Liar! all the time
Liar! oh, woh-woh-woh
They keep calling me "liar"
They know I'm a liar
Now that's the way to go-oh-oh

(guitar solo)

Listen!
Now you're gonna listen
Yeah
Mama, I'm gonna be your slave --all day long
Mama, I'm gonna try behave--all day long
Mama, I'm gonna be your slave--all day long
Mama, I'm gonna be your slave--all day long
I'm gonna love you till your dying day--all day long
I'm gonna kneel down by your side and pray--all day long

(additional guitar solo)

All day long (all day long)
All day long (all day long)
All day long (all day long)
All day long (all day long)
I'm gonna pray (all day long)
I'm gonna kneel down (all day long)
I'm gonna kneel down by your side

All day long, all day long, all day long

Liar, liar, they never ever let you win
Liar, liar, everything you do is sin
Liar, nobody believes you
Liar, they bring you down before you begin
Now let me tell you this
So now you know you could be dead before they let you

(Brian: Great, thanks a lot, thanks a lot for making it seem like coming home to the Rainbow this time, it's been really great)

[Brian: To finish up with, this is something from the new album, 'Sheer Heart Attack', written by young Freddie over there, it's called 'In The Lap Of The Gods... Revisited', thank you
Goodnight ...]

It's so easy, but I can't do it
It's so risky, but I gotta chance it
So funny; there's nothing to laugh about
My money: that's all you wanna talk about
I can see what you want me to be
But that's not true

It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoah, oh, la, la, la, oh
Be what you want me to be
That's not true ...

There's no beginning, there's no ending
There's no meaning in my pretending
But believe me, life goes on and on and on
Forgive me, when I ask you where do I belong
I can see what you want me to be
That's not true but I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoa-Oh, La, La, La; oh
Wo, Wo, La, La, wah, wah, ooh
I'm no fool but that's not true

It's in the lap of the Gods
Wo, wo, la, la, la, wo
Wo, wo, la, la, wah, wah, ooh
But I'm no fool

It's in the lap of the Gods
Wo, wo, la, la, la, wo
Wo, wo, la, la, wah, wah, ooh
I'm that's no fool

It's in the lap of the Gods
Wo, wo, la, la, la, wo
Wo, wo, la, la, wah, wah, ooh
I'm no fool

It's in the lap of the Gods
Wo, wo, la, la, la, wo
Wo, wo, la, la, wah, wah, ooh

Freddie: Thank you, good night everybody
Brian: Thank you, we love you

[Freddie: Thank you very much, you're terrific
Yes, thank you ...]

The minute you walked in the joint
I could see you were a woman of distinction
A real big spender
Good-looking
So refined:
Say, wouldn't you like to know what's going on in my mind?

Let me get right to the point
I don't pop my cork for everyone I see ...

Hey big spender!
Spend a little time with me

[Roger: A one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four]

Had to make do with a worn out rock and roll scene
The old bop is getting tired
Don't you know
Well, you know what I mean?

Fifty-eight that was great
But it's over now and that's all

Something harder's coming up
Gonna knock a hole in the wall

Gonna grab you hit you hard
Gonna make you ten feet tall

Well I hope that a brand new baby's
Gonna come along soon
And you know it could happen
Any old rainy afternoon
When the temperature's down
And the jukebox blowing a fuse
And my temperature ride
Just like a Sunday-school cruise

And you know everybody in this world could use
Modern times! - rock 'n' roll
Modern times! - rock 'n' roll

Get your high heeled guitar styled boots
And some groovy clothes
Get a hairpiece on your chest
A ring through your nose

Find a nice little man
Who's gonna make you big, big star
Stars in your eyes, ants in your pants
You gotta go far

And you know everybody
In this bum sucking world should go far

Rock 'n' roll

Warden threw a party in the county jail
Prison band was there and they began to wail
Band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing
Should've heard them knocked out jailbirds sing

Let's rock - everybody let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Dancing to the jailhouse rock

Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowing on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
Whole rhythm section was the purple gang
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Let's go

Sad sack sitting on a block of stone
Way in the corner weeping all alone
Don't you tell nobody, don't you be no square
Can't find a partner use a wooden chair
Let's rock, everybody let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Sad sack sitting on a block of stone
Way in the corner weeping all alone
Don't you tell nobody, don't you be no square
Can't find a partner use a wooden chair
Let's rock, everybody let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Dancing to the jailhouse rock

Freddie: Thank you, goodnight
I can't get you out of my mind
But I can give you all of my time
I'm gonna break all the guidelines
Forget about the day, let's 

[?]

If you never see
What you mean to me
If you want to feel
Let me spin the wheel
Bring me up
And every time you put me down
You ask for more
But you pull my leg to see me drown

You say love
You say love baby
I haven't seen love come around
Yeah I'm so numb
My whole body's shutting down

I wake up
You're still in my fuckin' head
I dream I'm stuck
Now I don't gotta live instead 

[?]

You can't stand me when you see me smile
Want me to feel hopeless like a little child
You want me to beg for you, on my knees
I'm faking love for you, faking love for me
C'mon baby please
C'mon baby please
Cry for you now, cry for me
You're the big rock, I'm the little stone
You don't seem to budge when I come
No you don't

You're a big wall, I'm a little stoned
All the other bricks went through holes
Michael, Michael

It's not like I never tried
To be the brick you lay with at night
At night

I tried, I tried

It's not often that you'd see
Big rock with a little stone like me

Anyway
I love you but it don't seem right
It don't seem
It don't seem right
(I love you but it don't seem right)
If you watch
Me swim
To you
So far
On land
In the sea
Riptides
From the cut 

[?]

I swim I drown, I got nothing to lose
But its so blue, I see you drowning too

Fill up my lungs all day
I swim by you okay
I'm not trying to save you
Don't you try to save me

I like the struggle in you
You bring it out in me

I swim I drown, I got nothing to lose
But its so blue, I see you drowning too
Drowning too
Drowning too
Yes i

[Refrain]
Know your place (Oh yeah), know your worth (Know it)
They feel a way, they throwin' dirt (Oh yeah)

[Verse 1]
My mama told me you gon' get what you deserve (You gon' get it)
So when they're throwin' shade, I sit there with a smirk (Woah, okay)
I cannot relate to what they're saying (Cannot relate)
I could never change and it's always been this way
I'm different, they don't look at me the same (No, they don't)
It was like that since an infant and I take that to my grave, boy
I was lookin' out for way too many (Lookin' out)
So I started looking up, hopefully, my uncle hear me
Goddamn, just thinkin' 'bout him gets me teary (Yeah, it do)
'Cause I remember that last conversation that we had so clearly

[Chorus]
He said, "Boy you got a dream, so go and make it work
If you listen to them others, they gon' put you in the dirt
Yeah they always be watchin', quietly, they'll lurk
And I want you to remember this until you're in a hearse"
I said, "Okay, I got a dream, so I'ma make it work
I won't listen to them others, they gon' put me in the dirt
Yeah I know they always watchin', quietly, they'll lurk
And I promise I'll remember 'til I'm all up in a hearse," ah yeah

[Verse 2]
Yeah, now they tryna tag along
I cannot mess with that 'cause they ain't always been around
Couldn't care about a pact but stay one night 

[?] to the mall
From the studio to the stage, you know that I shut it down, woah
Hold up, wait a minute, just spare me the moment
My uncle told me, "Get it, put your stamp on it and own it" (You better own it)
And I told him "Yeah, I get it," at the time, I didn't know but
I'm all the way up and to him, I kinda owe it

[Chorus]
He said, "Boy you got a dream, so go and make it work
If you listen to them others, they gon' put you in the dirt
Yeah they always be watchin', quietly, they'll lurk
And I want you to remember this until you're in a hearse"
I said, "Okay, I got a dream, so I'ma make it work
I won't listen to them others, they gon' put me in the dirt
Yeah I know they always watchin', quietly, they'll lurk
And I promise I'll remember 'til I'm all up in a hearse," ah yeah

[Refrain]

Know your place, know your worth (Know your worth)

Throwin' dirt, ayy, they throwin' it, throwin' it
They throwin' dirt, ayy

[Outro]
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah
I'ma get it, now you're gone
All these people runnin' to me, they all tryna tag along, yeah
They haven't been here since day one
Now they realizing the vision tryna copy what I'm on, like, yeah
I'ma get it, now you're gone
All these people runnin' to me, they all tryna tag along, yeah
They haven't been here since day one
Now they realizing the vision, tryna copy what I'm on, like

[Intro]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Woo, woo, woo, woo

[Chorus]
My whole life is changin'
All these people I don’t know sayin' they made me (Sayin' they made)
Here forever, yeah, I’m stayin'
In the game we don't play, I'm just sayin' (I'm just sayin', yeah)
Yeah, my whole life is changin'
All these people I don’t know sayin’ they made me (No you didn't)
Here forever, yeah, I’m stayin'
In the game we don't play, I'm just sayin’

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Lately, they all love to hate me (They do)
I feel like they'd do anything just to stop and break me
If you don't got my trust we cannot discuss what I'm making
Look at me in disgust, bitches know that it won't change me
I don't care if you don't feel this 'cause it's just the way I feel
They all making promises, but which of them was real?
Seein' all these rappers going straight in for the kill
If you wanna be successful, then you gonna have to fail, oh yeah

[Chorus]
My whole life is changin'
All these people I don't know sayin' they made me (Oh no, you didn't)
Here forever, yeah, I'm stayin'
In the game we don't play, I'm just sayin' (Um, I'm just sayin', uh)
Yeah, my whole life is changin'
All these people I don't know sayin' they made me (Woo, woo, woo)
Here forever, yeah, I'm stayin'
In the game we don't play, I'm just sayin'

[Verse 2]
Yeah
No old news, had to glo' up
Just watch, the kid gon' blow up
I've been in it for a minute
Business is the only thing that I'm consumed of
Now I've got a vision planned out
All these rappers in a bad drought
Know I'm the man with the plan now
All you boys in the background (Skrrt)
Used to laugh like it was funny or somethin'
Don't talk to me, you can't tell me nothin'
Rappers do the most, man, they always frontin'
If I buy it too, man, they always bluffin'
So how you feel, how you feel?
Now the kid is trill
Yeah I made my dreams real (Woo)
You already know the deal

[Chorus]
My whole life is changin'
All these people I don't know sayin' they made me
Here forever, yeah, I'm stayin'
In the game we don't play, I'm just sayin' (I mean, I'm)
Yeah, my whole life is changin'
All these people I don't know sayin' they made me (Oh no, you didn't)
Here forever, yeah, I'm stayin'
In the game we don't play, I'm just sayin' (Okay, okay)

[Verse 1]
Met a boy and he told me
That life gon' burn you out
You can go all four corners of the globe
Still, won’t know what you’re about
You got your issues, your tissues
You cry every night
I’m melodramatic
I guess he was right
Livin' out of that suitcase

[Pre-Chorus]
He said "girl better get on your way
Keep chasing the dragon"

[Chorus]
I guess he’s probably right
Keep chasing the dragon
That’s just how I’ll live my life
’Cause you know that, ooh
Nothing bout me’s typical
I said "ooh"
You know I’ll be chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly

[Verse 2]
Another thing that he told me
"It’s gonna be a long, long daylight"
He’s the one I feel bad for
Don’t have a passion like mine
I’ll keep my issues, my tissues
Keep runnin' the lights
I may be impulsive but I do all right
Livin' out of my suitcase

[Pre-Chorus]
He said "girl better get on your way
Keep chasing the dragon"

[Chorus]
I guess he’s probably right
Keep chasing the dragon
That’s just how I’ll live my life
’Cause you know that, ooh
Nothing bout me’s typical
I said "ooh"
You know I’ll be chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly

[Bridge]
No matter what he said to me
I’m gonna be running free, ooh
I just wanna fly, you see
Ain’t nothing stopping me
Ooh

[Chorus]
Keep chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
Keep chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
’Cause you know that
Nothing bout me’s typical
I said "ooh"
You know I’ll be chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
Keep chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly

[Verse 1]
Comin' back from the country
Full of good food and lousy beer
This winter's so dry and the dirt road so dusty
At the lightest fall of rain, the bacteria bloom

[Chorus]
You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix it

[Verse 2]
Tethered to a table with that happy holiday crowd
And it's anchors aweigh
Looks like smooth sailin'
But the merest hint of waves could capsize you

[Chorus]
You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's so easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix it

[Bridge]
The desire for annihilation
Is as common as it is unkind
And it's hard to recognize the situation
When you're desperately tryin' to have a good time

[Chorus]
You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix it

[Outro]
Yeah, it's Christmas
So no one can fix it

[Spoken]
I just have this song I gotta sing for you. I finally think I found it. Oh I know all those old songs, really, I still know "The Changes". And sometimes I feel like a green Wurlitzer. I love it when ya, you know, when you ask me for those old songs and everything but, it's funny 'cause what keeps you alive is what kills you you know, and you get - too much of the old shit you know, uh, good night

So here's a song I wrote especially for you, especially you loud boisterous mothers out there, I can hear ya. Just pretend you can hear that old pool hall clankin' in the background

I know you can relate to this song, it's a song I wrote about myself. It's called "Too Far Gone". Even though there've been - maybe nine songs with the same title in the last two years, I don't let things like that bother me. If I'm too far gone I got the right to say it, right?

Okay. Just checkin' with ya. It's 'cause of this abyss here. It's 'cause of this hole between us that I have to keep re - re-affirming ourselves, ya know. Like I sh- Here we go anyway. I was gonna tell you somethin', about, I was gonna tell you somethin', but - okay alright I'll tell ya okay, then I'll do the song. We'll be here a long time. Okay, that's not it. That's not it. Just think of this as George burns his cigar. When I look down here in the pit, when I did an earlier show tonight, I just wanna tell you that uh, I don't know if any other artists who ever play here, I use the word, uh, loosely, uh, before has told you this, but uh, down in the pit there uh, right down in here... can I have a little light on that so that people can see? Uh can you light up the pit please? Well anyway I wanna tell ya folks, you don't have to be able to see me to hear what I'm saying. What I'm gonna tell you is I saw Judy Garland down there tonight earlier. She was wearing a red dress, with red lipstick, and she had some, yeah uh, little bit of music with her right here uh, one of those music folios, it said "Somewhere over the rainbow", had a picture of her as a little girl looking up at me with the blue sky behind her, and there she was, Judy Garland in a red dress with a piece of music and she looked up and she said "How's the business Neil?". You don't have to believe me

[Sample]
Used to be a dreamer
Dreamin' of a fire

[Verse 1]
Uh, my mama used to pray that she'd see me in Yale
It's fucked up she gotta see me in jail
On the visit with Lil Papi, it hurt even though I seemed to be well
They got a smoker with a key to my cell, damn
And even worst, my judge black don't wanna see me do well
It's either that or black people for sale
Gave me two to four years like, "Fuck your life, meet me in hell"
And let it burn like Lucifer, you look even stupider
Tryna impress them people in power when power abusin' us
For 44 dollars a hour, you coward they using ya
Is it self-hate that made you send me upstate?
This where the so-called "real niggas" sweeping up for cupcakes
And that's your phone time, if you ain't got no money, you ain't online
Hey call your son, call your daughter just to wish them more prime
Oh God, don't let them streets get a hold of 'em
Your daughter fuckin' now, it's gon be a cold summer
Your son trapping, and your homie giving O's to him
And if he fuck that paper up, he puttin' holes through him
And you just wanna make it home, so you can show it to him
And them people ain't finna give no parole to ya
They want blood, we all hangin' with a noose on our neck
My celly mom just died, he wanna use my collect
And he won't make it to the wake unless he give 'em a check
We still niggas though, what you expect?

[Chorus]
I just won
I was on the corner with the reefa
And they got us warring for our freedom
See my brother blood on the pavement
How you wake up in the mornin' feelin' evil?
Uhh, trauma
When them drugs got a hold of your mama
And the judge got a hold on your father
Go to school, bullet holes in the locker

[Verse 2]
Ain't no PTSDs, them drugs keep it at ease
They shot that boy 20 times when they could've told him just freeze
Could've put him in a cop car, but they let him just bleed
The ambulance, they coming baby, just breathe
That's what the old lady said when she screamed
This nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th
And in the 13th amendment, it don't say that we kings
They say that we legally slaves if we go to the bing
They told Kaep' stand up if you wanna play for a team
And all his teammates ain't saying a thing (Stay woke)
If you don't stand for nothing, you gon' fall for something
And in the 60's, if you kneeled, you'd prolly be killed
But they don't kill you now, they just take you out of your deal
Kill your account, look where money get spilled
Check it, and they don't kill you now, they just take you out of your deal
Kill your account, look where money get spilled

[Chorus]
I just won
I was on the corner with the reefa
And they got us warring for our freedom
See my brother blood on the pavement
How you wake up in the mornin' feelin' evil?
Uhh, trauma
When them drugs got a hold of your mama
And the judge got a hold on your father
Go to school, bullet holes in the locker

[Verse 3]
How many times you send me to jail to know that I won't fail
Invisible shackles on the king, 'cause shit, I'm on bail
I went from selling out arenas, now shit, I'm on sale
Them cold nights starting to feel like hell, uhh
Watching a black woman take my freedom
Almost made me hate my people
When they label you felon, it's like they telling you they not equal
11 years going to court knowing they might keep you or drive you crazy
23 hours in a cell, somebody save me
I'm on a jail call, trying to explain it to my baby
I gotta do the calendar twice, and that's a maybe
Trauma

[Chorus]
I just won
I was on the corner with the reefa
And they got us warring for our freedom
See my brother blood on the pavement
How you wake up in the mornin' feelin' evil?
Uhh, trauma
When them drugs got a hold of your mama
And the judge got a hold on your father
Go to school, bullet holes in the locker

[Intro: Drake & Future]

Back home, smokin' legal (Legal)
I got more slaps than The Beatles (Beatles)
Foreign shit runnin' on diesel, dawg
Playin' with my name, that shit is lethal, dawg (Who you say you was?)
Don Corleone
Trust me, at the top it isn't lonely (Strapped)
Everybody actin' like they know me, dawg
Don't just say you're down, you gotta show me (What you gotta do?)
Bring the clip back empty (It's empty)
You asked to see the boss, so they sent me, dawg (Sent me, dawg)
I just broke her off with a 10-piece, dawg (10-piece, dawg)
That ain't nothin', I'm just bein' friendly, dawg

[Chorus: Drake]
It's just a lil' 10-piece for her
Just to blow it in the mall, doesn't mean that we're involved
I just... what? I just... uh, put a Richard on the card
I ain't grow up playin' ball, but I'll show you how the fuck you gotta do it
If you really wanna ball 'til you fall
When your back against the wall
And a bunch of niggas need you to go away
Still goin' bad on 'em anyway
Saw you last night, but did it broad day

[Post-Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, lot of Murakami in the hallway (What?)
Got a sticky and I keep it at my dawg's place
Girl, I left your love at Magic, now it's all shade
Still goin' bad on you anyway

[Interlude: Meek Mill]
Woah, woah, ooh, woah
Woah, woah, ah

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I could fit like 80 racks in my Amiris (80 racks)
Me and Drizzy back-to-back, it's gettin' scary (Back-to-back)
If you fuckin' with my opps, just don't come near me (Get outta my way)
Put some bands all on your head like Jason Terry (Brrt, brrt, ooh)
Richard Mille cost a Lambo (That's a Lambo)
Known to keep the baddest bitches on commando (Salute)
Every time I'm in my trap, I move like Rambo (Extended)
Ain't a neighborhood in Philly that I can't go (That's a Fendi)
For real
She said, "Oh, you rich rich?" ("You rich rich")
Bitch, I graduated, call me "Big Fish" (Marlin)
I got Lori Harvey on my wish list (That's Lori)
That's the only thing I want for Christmas (True story, uh)
I've been had my way out here, yeah, know that's facts (Facts)
You ain't livin' that shit you say, yeah, we know that's cap (That's cap)
You ain't got to ask me when you see me, know I'm strapped (Brrt)
DC, OVO, we back again, we goin' plat' (Ooh, ooh)

[Chorus: Drake]
It's just a lil' 10-piece for her
Just to blow it in the mall, doesn't mean that we're involved
I just... what? I just... uh, put a Richard on the card
I ain't grow up playin' ball, but I'll show you how the fuck you gotta do it
If you really wanna ball 'til you fall
When your back against the wall
And a bunch of niggas need you to go away
Still goin' bad on 'em anyway
Saw you last night, but did it broad day

[Outro: Future]
Wheezy outta here

[Intro]
Shout to young Cardo
Woo
Shoutout to Cardo

[Verse 1]
I bury you niggas in money
And then make it rain at your funeral
You flexing them tens and them twenties
Can tell that this money shit new to you
You get my chain, I don't want it back
You wear that shit while they viewing you
I'm in the field like a running back
Jumping out that Benz like a hula hoop
Call me the GOAT, but I'm in a Lam'
I jumped out the Porsche, and got me some grams
Ran up a check, start popping them bands
These niggas upset, thank God for my fam
Lord forgive me for totin' these semis
And puttin' these bad bitches up in Fendi
I got a fetish for gettin' this cheddar
Ain't going out bad when I'm in the city

[Chorus]
I ain't gotta front, I get what I want
If shawty a baddie, I hit from the front
She got a fatty, I hit from the back
They should have never let me get a sack
Oh yeah
I'm living legend, I swerve in that Lambo like I'm in the pack
Oh yeah
I'm going hard for this paper, they hating, ain't cuttin' no slack (Get it back, get it back)
Stuck in my ways, chasing this paper, been up for some days
Fucking lil' shawty, I let her hang with me, she fuckin' amazed
Crib so big, to get to my bedroom, it's fuckin' a maze
Cut her a check and tell her behave

[Verse 2]
I don't got time to be wasting my time
Too many bad bitches waiting in line
That pussy good, I'ma take her to Shyne
She lose a point, it'll make her a nine
She know I got some paper, I ain't gotta pay her
She just want me to pay her some mind
She wanna fuck a 'Chaser, I'ma fuck her later
But I really can't make up my mind
I want some money and I want some pussy  (Some pussy)
No lyin' like Lucious or Cookie (Yeah)
I built a empire sellin' that fire
I stayed on the block in a hoodie (Check check)
I turn my Glock onto fully (Fully)
I let it wop on a bully
I'm gettin' top in the telly (Ha)
It sound like she Mama's spaghetti

[Chorus]
I ain't gotta front, I get what I want
If shawty a baddie, I hit from the front
She got a fatty, I hit from the back
They should have never let me get a sack
Oh yeah
I'm living legend, I swerve in that Lambo like I'm in the pack
Oh yeah
I'm going hard for this paper, they hating, ain't cuttin' no slack (Get it back, get it back)
Stuck in my ways, chasing this paper, been up for some days
Fucking lil' shawty, I let her hang with me, she fucking amazed
Crib so big, to get to my bedroom, it's fuckin' a maze
Cut her a check and tell her behave

[Verse 3]
Ain't no finessing me (No)
Niggas they say it's all love and it better be (Yuh)
Can't get ahead of me (Whoa)
Whole 'nother level, they ain't on my pedigree
I got the recipe (Recipe)
I had to mix up the song with the melody (Mix it up)
Fuck is you tellin' me? (Tellin' me)
Shawty be choosing to keep her from messing me (Yeah)
Sniper Gang with me like Kodak
Really got money and you know that (Know that)
Better pay the tab if you owe that (Yeah)
For a nigga start layin' where your ho at
I'm from the north side of Philly my niggas will really send shot where your bro at (Shot)
I heard them niggas that's helpin' your hood got depressed when you hear you can't go back (Whoo)

[Chorus]
I ain't gotta front, I get what I want
If shawty a baddie, I hit from the front
She got a fattie, I hit from the back
They should have never let me get a sack
Oh yeah
I'm living legend, I swerve in that Lambo like I'm in the pack
Oh yeah
I'm going hard for this paper, they hating, they cuttin' no slack (Get it, man, get it, man)
Stuck in my ways, chasing this paper, been up for some days
Fucking lil shawty, I let her hang with me, she fucking amazed
Crib so big, to get to my bedroom, it's fuckin' a maze
Cut her a check and tell her behave

[Intro: Meek Mill]
You know what free is, nigga?

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
What's free?
Free is when nobody else could tell us what to be
Free is when the TV ain't controllin' what we see
Told my niggas, "I need you"
Through all the fame, you know I stayed true
Pray my niggas stay free
Made a few mistakes but this ain't where I wanna be
Before I'm judged by 12, put a 12 on my V
Told my niggas, "I need you"
Stay up, I know these times ain't true
Real life, what's free?

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Since a lad, I was cunning, just got a pad out in London
I keep stackin' my money, I'll need a ladder by summer
AK shots, niggas duckin' stray shots
Been a top dog, that's before the K-Dots
Crackin' in '06, immaculate showmanship
Talkin' like you Mitch, disastrous on the strip
Holdin' on your bitch, coulda never sold you a brick
With them people, you never been on a list
Mona Lisa to me ain't nothin' but a bitch
Hangin' pictures like niggas swingin' from his dick
We so different, you thought these didn't exist (M-M)
The Megalodon never seen on his wrist
I'm from the South where they never make it this rich
God is the greatest, but Satan been on his shit
Walkin' the pavement, I pray I'm illuminated
Over a decade and never nobody's favorite
Pot and kilo go hand in hand like we Gamble and Huff
My amigo, a million grams and we countin' 'em up (M-M)
You was dead broke, I let you hold a pack
You paid for it, but I fucked around and stole the track
Screaming "gang gang," now you wanna rat
Racketeering charges caught him on a tap
Lookin' for a bond, lawyers wanna tax
Purple hair got them faggots on your back
(M-M-Maybach music)

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
What's free?
Free is when nobody else could tell us what to be
Free is when the TV ain't controllin' what we see
Told my niggas, "I need you"
Through all the fame, you know I stayed true
Pray my niggas stay free
Made a few mistakes but this ain't where I wanna be
Before I'm judged by 12, put a 12 on my V
Told my niggas, "I need you"
Stay up, I know these times ain't true
Real life, what's free? (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Fed investigations, heard they plottin' like I trap
20 mill' in cash, they know I got that off of rap
Maybe it's the Michael Rubins or the Robert Krafts
Or the billionaire from Marcy, and the way they got my back, uh
See how I prevailed now they try to knock me back, uh
Locked me in a cell for all them nights and I won't snap, uh
Two-fifty a show and they still think I'm sellin' crack, uh
When you bring my name up to the judge, just tell him facts
Tell him how we fundin' all these kids to go to college
Tell him how we ceasin' all these wars, stoppin' violence
Tryna fix the system and the way that they designed it
I think they want me silenced (Shush)
Oh, say you can see, I don't feel like I'm free
Locked down in my cell, shackled from ankle to feet
Judge bangin' that gavel, turned me to slave from a king
Another day in the bing, I gotta hang from a string
Just for poppin' a wheelie, my people march through the city
From a cell to a chopper, view from the top of the city
You can tell how we rockin', soon as I pop up we litty
Poppin' like Bad Boy in '94, Big Poppa and Diddy
And niggas counted me out like my accountant ain't busy
That's five milli' in twenties, sit up and count 'til I'm dizzy
Phantom 500 thousand, hundred round in a stizzy
Is we beefin' or rappin'? I might just pop up with Drizzy like

[Chorus: Meek Mill & JAY-Z]
What's free?
Free is when nobody else could tell us what to be
Free is when the TV ain't controllin' what we see
Told my niggas, "I need you"
Through all the fame, you know I stayed true
Pray my niggas stay free
Made a few mistakes but this ain't where I wanna be
Before I'm judged by 12, put a 12 on my V
Told my niggas, "I need you"
Stay up, I know these times ain't true (Run it down)
Real life, what's free?

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
In the land of the free, where the blacks enslaved
Three-fifths of a man, I believe's the phrase
I'm 50% of D'USSÉ and it's debt free (Yeah)
100% of Ace of Spades, worth half a B (Uh)
Roc Nation, half of that, that's my piece
Hunnid percent of TIDAL to bust it up with my Gs, uh
'Cause most of my niggas won't ever work together
You run a check up but they never give you leverage
No red hat, don't Michael and Prince me and 'Ye
They separate you when you got Michael and Prince's DNA, uh
I ain't one of these house niggas you bought
My house like a resort, my house bigger than yours
My spou- (Come on, man)
My route better, of course
We started without food in our mouth
They gave us pork and pig intestines
Shit you discarded that we ingested, we made the project a wave
You came back, reinvested and gentrified it
Took niggas' sense of pride, now how that's free?
And them people stole the soul and hit niggas with 360s, huh
I ain't got a billion streams, got a billion dollars
Inflating numbers like we 'posed to be happy about this
We was praisin' Billboard, but we were young
Now I look at Billboard like, "Is you dumb?"
To this day, Grandma 'fraid what I might say
They gon' have to kill me, Grandmama, I'm not they slave
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, check out the bizarre (Ah)
Rappin' style used by me, the H-O-V
Look at my hair free, carefree, niggas ain't near free
Enjoy your chains, what's your employer name with the hairpiece?
I survived the hood, can't no Shaytan rob me
My accountant's so good, I'm practically livin' tax free
Factory, that's me
Sold drugs, got away scot-free
That's a CC, E-copy
Guilt free, still me
And expect me to not feel a way to this day
You would say y'all killed me
Sucker free, no shuckin' me, I don't jive turkey
Say "Happy Thanksgiving," shit sound like a murder to me
Smoke free, all of y'all callin' out toll free
Label rob you for millions yet you wanna put a hole in me
Sugar free, seasoned but I'm salt free
You lay a hand on Hov, my shooter shoot for free
I promise World War Three
Send a order through a hands free
Kill you in 24 hours or shorter, you can't ignore the hand speed
On god, it's off the head, this improv but it's no comedy
Sign I fail? Hell nah
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha) Hahahahahahahahaha

Pila de tigueres, rabia con alma
I let them eat up the nana, dip on a nigga, like, "See you

Baddest lil' bitch in my genre
I got your baby dad fuckin' up commas
Icy, icy, icy, drip all on me, watch me when I move (When I move)
If you like 'em freaky, baby, she could come here, too (For real?)
You could eat this pussy while I watch her fuckin' you
Call that hoe a Uber when we done, it's up to you (Oh, yeah)
Who your MCM? Bitch, I make him swipe

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Do a split on the dick (Do a split)

You sick, syphilis (Yeah, uh)

[Verse 1]
I gotta place my rearview when I pull in the parking spot
'Cause where I'm from all the young niggas die in the parking lot
Get ten seconds on the news, they barely talk about us
You gotta watch the way you move, they'll make a target outcha
Oh, the Reaper comin', gotta keep it on me
I told my momma I won't leave her lonely
Too much drama, get these demons off me
We still at war, I got that thing in arm reach
Fuck what happened
That's what my momma told me when they caught me with a ratchet
Rather see me in a cell than see me in a casket
I show love to all my fans 'cause I prevail through all this rapping, whoa
I got homies that died young and I miss 'em, tell the truth
I feel like I let 'em down and that's word to Lil Snupe
I put diamonds in yo face so when they see me they see you
Know they'd kill me in my hood, but I just keep on comin' through
Still wit' it, the graveyard throwing a party for all the real niggas
They invited me, but shit I got a meal ticket
When everybody want me to get out we gotta deal wit' it

[Pre-Chorus]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I did some things that I had to regret
I seen some things I could never forget
The reaper took my homie's soul, feel like he after me next, oh Lord

[Chorus]
I just wanna ball a hunnid summers
Seen too many of my dogs goin' under
How I made it out alive, sometimes I wonder
'Cause we been goin' to war since Contra

[Verse 2]
Grew up 'round them monsters they'll shoot you in your face
Ain't used to showin' no love that's 'cause we grew up in that hate
Live by the sword, die by the sword way
Tried to make it home, they shot him in the hallway
Tears on my face feel like I be cryin' blood
Momma won't see her son again, we call that blind love
I can't trust these niggas, they'll get you lined up
Tried to rob me, he got smoked for a Rollie, his time's up
You gon' be a killer or a homicide
Make your momma shed a tear before my momma cry
Was young and great, but they still smoked him at the waffle spot
Only God can judge me when I clutch and let that chopper rock (Brrr)
Feel this shit
I wrote this in blood, this some of my realest shit
They say if he rich as fuck, why he movin' so militant
'Cause in my hood it ain't no love and I know what I'm dealin' wit'

[Pre-Chorus]
As I walk through the valley of the shadows of death
I did some things that I had to regret
I seen some things I could never forget
The reaper took my homie's soul, feel like he after me next, oh Lord

[Chorus]
I just wanna ball a hunnid summers
Seen too many of my dogs goin' under
How I made it out alive, sometimes I wonder
'Cause we been goin' to war since Contra

Just me, I don't need no shooter
Don't come to me 'bout no mess
Want beef, I'm sayin' less
It ain't nothin' to get you wet
Make a movie on your set

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Benji, Benji, Benji on Benjis (Benjis)
Keepin' my hoes in that Fendi (That Fendi)
Whippin' that Rolls like a Hemi (Skrrt)
Face down, smearin' her Fenty, uh
Niggas, they always got somethin' to say
See 'em, it's nothin' to talk about (Nothin')
Catch you and you tried to stunt in the club
You gettin' smoked in the parking lot
Came on the block (Uh), brand new Saint Laurent (Whoa)
I gotta lay off designer 'cause honestly I've just been makin' 'em hot (Yeah)
I'm not a Muslim but I had to put in them prayers to make it sell out (Woo)
I know my way to the top
I took a circle and made it a block, run (Break it down)
Red fish, blue fish, old bitch, new bitch (New bitch)
Niggas said it's on sight, see me, he ain't do shit, uh

Just me, I don't need no shooter
Don't come to me 'bout no mess
Want beef, I'm sayin' less
It ain't nothin' to get you wet
Make a movie on your set

[Verse 1]
Ugh, every bitch I'm fuckin' say they only fuckin' me
I even bought you diamonds, put you in that double C
The way you love the game, you couldn't be in love with me
I work too hard for my name to let a bitch put mud on me
So how can I trust you? (Trust you)
When all the rich niggas fucked you (Fucked you)
Make you my baby, I'd love to (Love to)
You was a dime, but I dubbed you (Dubbed you)
When I first bagged you that shit had me excited
Swimming in that pussy, girl, I swear there's nothing like it
I got plans to cut you off, I know that you won't like it
I knew that it would come to this, I seen it like a psychic
Turned you to a savage (Savage)
I won't forget you, you a bad bitch (Bad bitch)
I set you up so you could level up (Level up)
But you was used to being average (Average)
Jumpin' on jets, you was caught up in the life
They gassed you on Instagram, you caught up in the hype
A ho gon' be a ho, so ain't no use for no advice
When you crossed me, you lost me, can't let you cross me twice

[Chorus]
I almost fell in love with a thottie (Oh)
My dawg said "You got too many bodies" (Ooh)
Girl, that pussy had me like a zombie (Oh)
I gotta pour out my feelings that's inside me, yeah
What happened in the dark is gon' come to the light (Come to the light)
Magic from the start, you was fuckin' me right (Fuckin' me right)
Treat me like a king baby talk to me nice (Talk to me)

[Verse 2]
You fucking with a ball player and now you acting bougie
Seen you out in traffic you act like you never knew me
I just bust out laughing when I seen with you that goofy (Ha)
Savage for that money, you like Ginger from the movie, ooh
I almost fell in love with a ho
I still dream of me fuckin' you slow
Ass so fat all the stuff from the back
I still watch all our old videos
And I still hear that pussy callin' (Callin')
It's so wet, it's slippery, it let me fall in
And from the way you treated me, almost went all in (All in)
Had to check your mileage and I started stallin' (Stallin')
'Cause relationships turn into situationships
I know you don't wanna hear this player shit, but baby I'm made for this
You made your bed, you gotta lay in it
My heart can't play with this (No)
Gotta save myself before I try to save a bitch (Woah)
I ain't been cuffing on no hoes and I ain't gon' start
Had to Patek my wrist, protect my heart (Protect my heart)
Had to Patek my wrist, protect my heart
Because this cold game left my heart cold, now I promise it ain't my fault

[Chorus]
I almost fell in love with a thottie (Oh)
My dawg said "You got too many bodies" (Ooh)
Girl, that pussy had me like a zombie (Oh)
I gotta pour out my feelings that's inside me, yeah
What happened in the dark is gon' come to the light (Come to the light)
Magic from the start, you was fuckin' me right (Fuckin' me right)
Treat me like a king baby talk to me nice (Talk to me)

[Verse 3]
Ugh, I gotta keep a vest on my heart (On my heart)
You the reason the good women got it hard (Got it hard)
Shit, we was good until our feelings got involved
That's when I did my homework and then I really got involved, oh
Oh, and I don't know how I'ma go 'bout it
Now a nigga coldhearted, baby, nobody
Get this hard, you suck the soul out me
Found out you a whole thottie
And you got a whole lotta bodies, nobody
No, you let what we had die young (Die young)
And that's word to Lil Roddy (Lil, no, no)
Soon as I thought I got one, I was like

[Chorus]
I almost fell in love with a thottie (Oh)
My dawg said "You got too many bodies" (Ooh)
Girl, that pussy had me like a zombie (Oh)
I gotta pour out my feelings that's inside me, yeah
What happened in the dark is gon' come to the light (Come to the light)
Magic from the start, you was fuckin' me right (Fuckin' me right)
Treat me like a king baby talk to me nice (Talk to me)

[Intro]
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
All the young'uns in my hood popping percs now
Gettin' high to get by, it's gettin' worse now
You gotta tell 'em put them guns and them percs down
Them new jails got ten yards in 'em and that's your first down, uh
And I ain't come here to preach
I just had to say somethin' 'cause I'm the one with the reach
Youngin' gotta quarter ounce, he tryna turn into Meech
Ain't had no daddy, he's had to learn from the streets
I used to be a honor roll student, damn
Then I turned to a beast
The first time I seen a nigga get some blood on his sneaks
He had on Air Max 93s but was slumped in the street
His mama cryin', that did somethin' to me, oh Lord
The shit I'm doin' for my hood I won't get an award
I used to sell Reggie, damn how' I get to the Forbes?
I take a shot, if I miss I'm gettin' them boards
Ain't quittin' no more, like give me some more
We wearing Old Navy, it felt like Christian Dior
Was dead broke but rich in soul, was we really that poor?
Was we really that dumb? 'Cause we carry a gun
And every nigga in my neighborhood carryin' one
'Cause we had nightmares of our mamas gotta bury her son
I'm speakin' to you as a prophet as rare as they come, uh
Gunshots sound like music hangin' out the Buick
Why you wanna be a shooter?
Mama told me not to do it but I did it
Now I'm locked up in a prison
Callin' mama like "I shouldn't have did it"
Watch my dream shatter in an instant
I'm on a visit posin' for the picture
Like I'm going for my prom or somethin'
Like I ain't facing time or somethin'
Ridin' for these niggas like that shit ain't hurt my mom or somethin'
Only one gon' get me commissary or even buy me somethin'
When it all fall down
I can't call y'all now
Even if I hit your phone
That won't get me home
Seen so many different times, these niggas did me wrong
Shit that's the reason that I did this song

[Verse 2]
Shit we was kids used to play on the step
A couple years later we flirtin' with the angel of death
I was 11 years old, I got my hands on the TEC
When I first touched it that shit gave me a rush
My homie's dying I'm like "Maybe we next"
That just made me a threat
Knowin' the niggas smoke my daddy it just made me upset
Made me a man shit I was five when God gave me my test
Go to court with a court appointed and he won't say he objects
Now it's you against the state and you ain't got no cake
Jail overpopulated they ain't got no space
I know a young'un that got murked ain't get to drive no Wraith
But he in the hearse on the way to church, I know his mom gon' faint
When she smell like embalment fluid, cologne all on her baby
Pastor said he sendin' you home, she goin' crazy
When they drop that casket all in the ground, who gon' save me?
How could you blame me? When I'm tryna stay alive and just survive and beat them odds when niggas die by twenty-five
When I stop fearin' for my life, when I decide to change my mind And stop totin'
Tryna smoke the pain away, they lock us up for smoking
Put 'em on probation, lock 'em up if you ain't perfect
Victim to the system like a rain drop in the ocean
They closin' all the schools and all the prisons gettin' open

[Outro]
Yeah
See comin' from where I come from
We had to beat the streets
Beat the system, beat racism, beat poverty
And now we made it through all that we at the championship

[Verse 1]
Yah
Big bag, got 'em big mad
A nigga gettin' to some money and his bitch bad
Jumpin' out the Rolls truck with the temp tag
I'm gettin' money, I don't get mad, ugh
Ask a nigga in my hood, he gon' say that I'm stamped
And when them situations came, I came out like a champ
When it was pourin' down rain and I came out of it damp
But now it's champagne showers when we poppin' the champ', ugh
We dodged all the Feds and they traps
Niggas can't be us 'cause they rats
Stand tall, point a finger, never that
I knew a nigga had it all, went to the bing, ain't get it back
That's why I'm humble as ever, and I rumble whatever
Don't chase hoes 'cause they come with this cheddar
I seen my man girl start actin' bougie when he fuck up his cheddar
Before you knew it, niggas was fuckin' her better
I knew about it and I-
Wanted to tell him, I felt funny as ever
But when I told him, he went runnin' to tell her, damn
Remember I was down bad, I'm talkin' under the cellar
Now the Rolls Royces come with umbrellas
For the rain and all the pain that we been through
If you don't feed your wolves they gon' put you on the menu
That's why I be with family and some buls that I been knew
If money determined loyalty, we'd cut you with a Ginsu
Now I go against you, facts

[Chorus]
Rule number one, never count your homie pockets thinkin' you deserve it
Rule number two, never trust a bitch that'll fuck you for some purses
Rule number three, save you some of that money, shit you better stop splurgin'
'Cause when it's all said and done and you back at the bottom, they gon' treat you like you worthless
Respect the game

[Verse 2]
Fuck the fame
We millionaires fuck your watch and lil' chain
Niggas disappear as quick as Lil Zane
You feelin' yourself, I know you got a lil' lane
Just hold your composure, I seen this shit happen over and over
That couple hundred thousand holdin' you over
That ain't real money
That's bill money, buy a Rollie, get a wheel money
Catch a case, pay a lawyer, take a deal money
Now you tapped out and got no appeal money
Callin' home like niggas done did you wrong
But when you had that money you could've put niggas on
And the moment they put cuffs on you, your bitch was gone
Student of the game, I'm just ahead of my class
I'm that nigga, but I never got my head up my ass
You doin' good, but I'm ready for bad
And you won't never catch me frontin' 'cause I'm used to bein' second to last
Respect the game

[Chorus]
Rule number one, never count your homie pockets thinkin' you deserve it
Rule number two, never trust a bitch that'll fuck you for some purses
Rule number three, save you some of that money, shit you better stop splurgin'
'Cause when it's all said and done and you back at the bottom, they gon' treat you like you worthless
Respect the game

[Intro]
It feel like a crime
Ayy, young niggas stay way misunderstand
No, I can't change my way, feel good, bruh
Niggas don’t make it from my hood
That's why I'm gettin’ high
And no, I can't let a day go by
Know a nigga on it rain or shine
I heard you niggas stay online
Ayy, uh, listen, listen, listen, yeah, yeah, uh, uh
Listen, uh, ayy, listen, listen

[Chorus]
It feel like a crime
Young niggas stay way misunderstood
No, I can't change my way, feel good, bruh
Niggas don't make it from my hood
That's why I'm gettin' high
No, I can't let a day go by
Know a nigga on it rain or shine
I heard you niggas stay online
’Cause I’m comin' alive

[Verse 1]
Riding through the city on some dirty shit
Reserve perfectly, swift as a surgeon
No murder I’m flirting with, I'm nerveless
I got a different purpose
You just itching the surface
You just a gimmick purchase
Bitch, I'm still that nig in person
I'm double working over friends
’Cause most these niggas serpents
Who really with me in this skirmish? Man, this shit a circus
I'm really tryna flourish but I'm in this burning furnace
And I heard it never wait for turns and I'm just being earnest
You niggas don't deserve this
I'll take everything you believe and leave that shit deserted
You just falling in with the stream, I'm in a different current
Check how I swerve in this mix, it's still existent
I know how urgent it gets, cut all that silly shit
Came in the building to break these millies with my affiliates
We on the high line, you picturing from the sidelines
Crossing these pylons
I'm 'bout the commas, fuck the dot com, nigga

[Chorus]
It feel like a crime
Young niggas stay way misunderstood
No, I can't change my way, feel good, bruh
Niggas don't make it from my hood
That's why I'm gettin' high
No, I can't let a day go by
Know a nigga on it rain or shine
I heard you niggas stay online
'Cause I'm comin' alive

[Verse 2]
I been catching real vibes, what do you believe?
I been up here workin', I been smokin' weed
Half a dozen tricks that I got up my sleeve
I don't see too many ways that I can't succeed
Gettin' high enough to bring a cloud down
I done had this pope vision for a while now
I inspire, so many niggas should bow down
I freestyle and every event to me is wild style
I can turn my burdens to a love song
In the mist of the trouble, feel like it's nothing wrong
I can see right through it when it's done wrong
And I can end it all like Thanos with the glove on
I believe in karma, what do you believe?
I believe my timing now is true indeed
I feel like I lived this, this ain't new for me
And I be coming for everything that was due for me, for real

[Bridge]
Aw yeah, that's perfect
Way misunderstood
Niggas don't make it from my hood
Ayy, uh, uh

[Chorus]
Said, it feel like a crime
Young niggas stay way misunderstood
No, I can't change my way, feel good, bruh
Niggas don't make it from my hood
That's why I'm gettin' high
No, I can't let a day go by
Know a nigga on it rain or shine
I heard you niggas stay online
'Cause I'm comin' alive

[Outro]
Bitch, I'm comin' alive
Stay yo' bitch ass online, ayy
Stay yo' ass online
'Cause y'all ain't built for this shit, for real though
Stay yo' ass online
'Cause you don't really want it in real life
You don't know what it feel like
Yeah, shit feel right
Don't come outside
You better stay yo' ass online
Don't come outside, na-na-na-na
'Cause I'm comin' for mine, I'm comin' alive
Niggas stay online

[Intro]
It's a facade

[?] gyal if I'm not so east I'm west
From the body look what I have, know you have to God bless

[?]

[Verse 1]
Ah, these niggas must be shittin' me
Are you kiddin' me? Physically, mentally send me shots
I feel like they can't injure me, my finesse to infinity
How these niggas pretend to be?
I been carryin' this since inception, nigga, remember me?
Hoppin' out wild since 2011
Smokin' weed, dirty heathen, how I'm gon' learn a lesson?
His back snap, leave him back flat with no further stressin'
Still tryna figure if this passion is curse or blessin'
The man is savage, back at it
Gas is back, fumin'
Back to back caps, no Metro, soon boomin'
Why run from it? I can fuckin' shoot through it
I'ma smoke 'em down to ash and brush it off, a new human

[Chorus]
I swear I been doin' this shit for too long
If you think I'm losin' my shit, you too wrong
On my too-high-to-give-a-fuck-what-you-on
Tappin' in a new wave, and my rag is two-tone, ya dig?

[Verse 2]
Now, I be goin' through shit, be havin' a lot on my mind
But I'm so used to this shit, don't you worry about me, I'm fine
I get finicky, get sick when I'm not out on my grind
So I been workin' like a servant, watch my daughters recline
Recline never, I'm better, pleasure when apply pressure
Multiply my endeavors, I don't think I die ever
Livi-livin' like a screenplay, every single weekday
On the boulevard breakin' your dreams like Green Day
Really in the action, y'all niggas best watch the replay, no inglés
Put him in a sling, wait comprende, comprende?
No inglés I put 'em in a...

[Chorus]
I swear I been doin' this shit for too long
If you think I'm losin' my shit, you too wrong
On my too-high-to-give-a-fuck-what-you-on
Tappin' in a new wave, and my rag is two-tone, ya dig me?

[Outro]
Ya dig me?

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Act like you know who I am when I fly through the land
That's some courtesy
Don’t hurry me, I'm so serene on the scene
If I leave, that's gon’ breed an emergency
That's urgency, heard of me certainly
Work and I flirt with this weed 'til they bury me
Absurd to me I'm steering clean of the dirt
But still got the devil tryna flurry me
But currently I didn't get in this position I'm in just for niggas to worry me
I been in this shit for a bit so I got let you niggas get word of me
I stick in this bitch for the permanent or 'til I'm stuck in infirmary
’Cause trust ain’t nothing but a word
You niggas still on verge over perjury

[Verse 2: Buddy]
Yeah, yeah, ayy
So I stepped into a check with the blessin'
Now the question is, what should I invest in?
Crept in with a weapon and my best friend
Hold your breath man before you be a dead man
Flexing like I’m wrestling, bitch I'm destined
Getting money cause I'm working like a Mexican
Best dressed nigga in the west
With a lotta charm and a little finesse
Diamond grade boogers hanging off of my neck
Got a couple women tryna ruin the rep
I give every rumor twenty seconds or less
Made a couple milli' and I ain’t done yet
Ayy, I feel like Denzel, I feel like Denzel
'Bout to FaceTime with my pen pal
Light up that weed and I inhale

[Verse 3: Domo Genesis]
I wish I could do it for a while now
Finna wild out 'til they let a nigga chow down
Hope I don't foul out
Still run wild through the city with a ticket like Bow Wow
Never did doubt but my route
Got me seeing that the clout is what all y'all about now
Better get a foul now when I pop style, layin' everything down

[Verse 4: Buddy]
Niggas better have white towel wavin'
Niggas better come at me with down payments
Lil nigga duckin' like Cal Cambridge
One-Punch Man, get your town vanquished
And I ain't gotta die for attention
I ain't no facade, I be livin', might ride 'til the finish
So high like the sky ain't the limit
I don't even ride with the ceilin'
Blood red eyes feeling like divine intervention, no God

[Outro]
No God
No God
No God

[Verse 1: IDK]
I might just pull up on your bitch for the hell of it
Speaking of hell I told my pastor I was celibate
But celebrated last night after fuckin' a bad dike
She rode my dick until she lost a wheel just like a bad bike
Pray 'cause that ain't God like (God like)
I smell pussy, you niggas Ja like
And I don't mean the DMV talk
I mean a nigga with the Cookie Monster sound bite
Which nobody accepted that his singing didn't sound right
He's still a legend though
Is Ashanti still fine or is she very, very old?
You never fuckin' know
Some women age like J.Lo or age like Whoopie Gold
Again, you never fuckin' know
So I'ma keep it on my toes and never wife no ho
Jump on my stick like a motherfuckin' pogo
This shit that I spit could drench the fuckin' ozone
They don't get it, they don't get it, they motherfuckin' dodos
I'm with my nigga Domo, he's more West Coast than lo-lo
Sittin' on 64s
He got like 64 reasons to give you lyrical fo-fo
I'm in an M-Beam, a normal Beamer is a no-no
You say you got a foreign, but your foreign is a Volvo

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
This is what you fuckin' like, shit I keep you up at night
This is what you wanted right? Never in your fuckin' life
I'm scared off of no shit talkin'
A SIG choppin' your wig I got that slick talkin'
Get your fuckin' skin crawling 'til death
Destined to live, have to revenge often
My heart black as a lit cig, the wrist flick killin' all in spite
Of a nigga just on some sick shit
I scrambled all of my life on some Michael Vick shit
I fled prolly tryna keep the Feds off me
Takin' to they head like I'm tryin' date a zombie
Lookin' half dead in the telly lobby
But I tell 'em don't you put that fuckin' evil on me Ricky Bobby
I'm a fuckin' fright-fair, a walkin' nightmare
Don't you ever go to sleep, bitch, I'm comin' right there
Energy is different, feel it in the night air
I'm a dirty motherfucker in some ugly Nike Airs, like

[Outro: Chip tha Ripper]
Somebody watchin' every minute
I can feel somebody watchin' every minute
Every minute, ever minute, every minute, every minute
Walkin' to my car feelin' timid
I think there's somethin' lookin' at me every minute
Every minute, ever minute, every minute, every minute

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Catch me wilin' wit my woadies, carryin' fillet, fully loaded
I push that power trip up to the limit, still I'm focused
Villain with the motive if you feel heroic
See, I ain't gotta be convinced and I was in before I wrote it, bitch
Winning board, back to the business, boy, what you winnin' for?
Don't feel the aura, pure to your gimmicks, boy, with the image for
Forgive me, lord, living my life, that means I'm sinning more
A scary nigga, doubting my mind, I never been before
I'm tour swag, had the vision packed from the jump
I left them actors dust, only way I look back and discuss
Fuck the bashful act, going back to black and turning madness up
I've had it up to h-, I'm back to crash and through your traffic rush
Screaming "move, bitch, get out the way!"
I'm 'bout to cause a scene when I bring the truth out to play
Getting highly medicated out the way
Bitch, we win the game tryna draw you out to play, big me
Never liar, human-made attire
In that visage, you won't got a best use by a day decided
Never liar, human-made attire
In that visage, you won't got a best use by a day decided

[Chorus: Domo Genesis]
Ripping pieces off the leaf, I'm 'bout to smoke, nigga
Ain't shit funny, but a joke, nigga
I'll be damned if I'ma die and be a broke nigga
Chasing hundred dolla bills until I croak, nigga

[Verse 2: Cozz]
Dawg, you see no frogs, just the men that be in charge
We at large, fleeing from the cars that belong to the badged and armed
Killed a couple artists and put 'em all in a morgue
Killed a lot of sergeants and now they call him the God of War
If it ain't Cozz, ignore it, what the fuck you nodding for?
All that shit is bullshit, this shit like a matador
All my shit be knocking so often you got a harder door
The type of shit you try to put cough drops in a coffin for, 'cause you know I'm sick and it kills you
You thought a sword would stop the lord from giving me all my blessings and my rewards
This why I'm often bored, y'all getting so predictable
I'm ha-ha-ing more, I know I'm bragging but to mop the floor with ya is not a chore, nigga
Lyrical toys with us, but not mature children
Childish with the weapon, I'm excited when it's yelling
My saga brings diamonds and real G's to the environment

[Outro: Domo Genesis]
Ripping pieces off the leaf, I'm 'bout to smoke, nigga
Ain't shit funny, but a joke, nigga
Chasing hundred dolla bills until I croak, nigga

[Intro]
Smokin' weed, smokin'
Ahh baby, smokin'

[Verse 1]
Man, this shit been such a facade lately
I don't know what to tell y'all (It's a facade)
Niggas fugazi tryna run them plates by me and I be like hell naw
Back up with that pressure, best to let a nigga breathe
I'm probably on some level you niggas never believe
And no, I never left 'em, always kept a trigger but a sleeve
And you can find me

[Chorus]
I be out here smokin' weed (Smokin', smokin')
Yeah (Smokin')
And you can find me
Smokin' weed (Smokin', smokin')
I be out here smoking weed

[Verse 2]
I'm like Jesus, would you save me please?
'Cause all these niggas make believe, like I love getting paid
But it ain't great as how you make it seem
'Cause you know what that paper bring
Kelly envy friends and family, and that's a dangerous thing
I used to have swag when I was broke and I ain't change a thing
But you know them bathing apes is clean
I might wear a whole different outfit with the same jeans, I'm still a hunnit

[Hook]
Smokin' weed
I be out here smokin' weed (Smokin')
I be out here smokin' weed (Smokin')
I be out here smokin' weed (Yeah, yeah)
I be out here smokin' weed (Smokin' weed)
Smokin' weed

[Verse 3]
I'ma leave these haters on some mad shit
'Cause I'ma start acting like I ain't had shit (What else?)
All of this fakin', I'm not passionate
Now I'm giving the whole world my ass to kiss
When I was fumbling with my last trip of sanity, y'all ain't have a hand for me
I hit you with that "Sorry, I was busy, couldn't answer, B"
Petty betty business shit, I'm already in it
And I can't let a nigga put a stain on my image
Like Vontae Davis, I'ma go and leave you niggas to finish
Plus I can't let you eat up all of my anytime minutes

[Outro]
Smokin' weed
And I be high when you find me
I be out here smokin' weed
I be out here smokin' weed (Yo, yo, yo)
I be out here smokin' weed
And I be high when you find me
I be out here smokin' weed
I be out here smokin' weed
I be out here smokin' weed
I be out here smokin' weed
See, I be out here smokin' weed
I be out here smokin' weed
I'm out here smokin' weed

[Verse 1]
Say, can you hear?
Is there a meaning to your grief?
Where there is pain you see grace
As if sacrifice was a meaningful end in itself
Your trial and error is error and error

[Chorus]
Staying at the end of a hallway
Dozens of doors you never tried to open
Narrow vision, you’re the scapegoat
Try to fix things that have never been broken

[Verse 2]
You’re self-absorbed
Raving about your cryptic ways
Aren’t willing to change
Old grudges
Hoping for your turn
All the basement stories you heard
Waiting for the world
To bend around you

[Chorus]
Staying at the end of a hallway
Dozens of doors you never tried to open
Narrow vision, you’re the scapegoat
Try to fix things that have never been broken

[Bridge]
Waiting for the world to bend around you
Waiting for the world to bend around you

[Chorus]
Staying at the end of a hallway
(Waiting for the world to bend around you)
Dozens of doors you never tried to open
Narrow vision, you’re the scapegoat
Try to fix things that have never been broken

[Verse 1]
Hello
There's a place
I've been going
There's a place I've been going
Now I'm clean
It would seem
Let's go somewhere I'll be seen
As sad as it seems
I seen Greg and he was like
"I seen your friends at the birthday party
They were kinda fucked up before it even started
They were gonna go to the Pinegrove show
They didn't know about all the weird stuff
So they just left it" (So they just left it)
I was wasted (I was wasted)
And cold
And minding my business

[Verse 2]
And I seen the girls and they were all like
"Do you wanna come and get fucked up?"
Listen, I got myself a missus, says there can't be any kissing
"No, don't be a fridge, you better wise up, kid
It's all Adderall now, it doesn't make you wanna do it"

[Verse 3]
"This ain't going well"
I thought that I was stuck in Hell
In a boring conversation with a girl called Mel
About her friend in Cincinnati called Matty as well
You pulled away when I went in for the kiss
No, it wasn't a diss
You put the tap on to cover up the sound of your piss
After four years, don't you think I'm over all this?
"That's rich from a man who can't shit in a hotel room
He's gotta share for a bit"
You make a little hobby out of going to the lobby
To get things that they don't have

[Verse 4]
Does it go through ya when I'm talking to ya?
You know that I could sue ya if we're married
And you fuck up again
Impress myself with stealth and bad health
And my wealth and progressive causes
Then drink your kombucha and buy an Ed Ruscha
Surely, it's a print 'cause I'm not made of it
Look, the fucking state of it
I came pretty late to it
We can still be mates 'cause it's only a picture

[Outro]
All your friends
In one place
Oh, we're a scene
Whatever that means
I depend
On my friends
To stay clean
As sad as it seems
As sad as it seems (Alright)
As sad as it seems (Come on)

Shots at your fitted (Ayy), mm, I did it

Asking for the money, where your racks at?

Cartier, Cartier, throwing shade, uh
Asian bitch really like to crochet, uh
And my wrist never like throwing shade, uh
Came to the crib off of Kool-Aid, ayy

We began after the storm inside
Lay the land, it's just the morning light
We began after the storm inside
Lay the land, it's just the morning light

[Verse 1]
Love me, love me, love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you

[Refrain]
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind
Wild is the wind

[Verse 2]
Give me more than one cares
Satisfy this hungriness

[Refrain]
Let the wind blow through your hair
For wild is the wind, wild is the wind

[Chorus]
You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss my life begins
Oh, you're spring to me, all things to me
Don't you know you're life itself?

Like the leaf clings to the tree
Oh my darling cling to me, oh

[Refrain]
For we're like creatures in the wind
And wild is the wind, wild is the wind

You kiss me and
With your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me
Don't you know you're life itself?

For we're like creatures in the wind
And wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Oh wild is the wind
Wild is the wind

Oh, thank you so much

[Chorus 1]
I couldn't escape this feeling with my China Girl
I'm just a wreck without my little China Girl
I hear her heart beating, it's loud as thunder
I saw her stars crashing
I'm just a mess without my little China Girl
Wake up in the morning there's my little China Girl
I hear heart beating, it's loud as thunder
I saw her stars crashing

[Verse 1]
I'm feeling tragic like Marlon Brando
When I look at my China Girl, uh yeah
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China Girl
She said
She said
I stumble into town just like some sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes
Oh, yeah

[Bridge]
My little china girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything that you are
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world

[Chorus 2]
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
She says, "Shh"
She says, "Shh"
She says
She says

[Outro]
Uh, uh, uh, oh
Little China Girl
Uh, uh, uh, oh
Little China Girl
Thank you
Oh, Glastonbury
Glastonbury
You got a very very lucky face

[Intro]
All of you
I'd just written this one the first time I played Glastonbury in 1971

[Verse 1]
I still don't know what I was waiting for
Time was running wild
A million dead end streets
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
Then I turned myself to face me
But I never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see this faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Woohoo. changes
Do you wanna have to be a better man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Woohoo, changes
I just wanted to be a better man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

[Post-Chorus]
Hey (Yeah)
Yeah
Oh, yeah (Oh yeah)

[Verse 2]
Ripples change their size
Never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
Still the days seem just the same
And these children that they spit on
As they try to change their worlds
They're immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-Changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Woohoo changes
Looks like you've left them up to their necks in it
Time may change me
I can't trace time

[Bridge]
Strange fascination, fascinate me, oh
Changes are taking the pace I'm going to

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Look out all you rock 'n rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now you're gonna get older
Time may change me
I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
I can't trace time

[Outro]
Hehehe
Ooh

[Intro]
Time this one was written, 1975
Guy played the album with me on that frozen station
Was Earl Slick

[Verse 1]
This week has past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I know there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If you would stay here tonight
That would be crazy tonight

[Chorus]
Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is
Stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
But you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

[Verse 2]
Heart wrecker, heart wrecker
See me tonight
Life is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

[Chorus]
Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is
Stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
But you can never really tell
When somebody wants someone to
Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is
Stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
But you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

[Outro]
Stay
Won't you stay?
Won't you stay?
Won't you stay?
Won't you stay? Hey
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay

[Intro]
This one goes back to about the same time period as a, Changes
I'm very fearful tonight as I got struck down by laryngitis earlier this week
So if I give out and if any of you know any of the words
For God's sake, join in
Counting on you

[Verse 1]
It's a god awful small affair
To the girl with the mousey hair
But her mummy is yelling, "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause she's lived it ten times or more
It's about to be lived again
As they ask her to focus on

[Chorus]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man, wonder if he'll ever know
It's the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

[Verse 2]
It's on America's tortured brow
Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
And the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

[Chorus]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man, wonder if he'll ever know
It's the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

[Outro]
Thank you

[Intro]
This song is not like any of the ones so far
This one is called "Ashes to Ashes"

[Verse 1]
Do you remember a guy that's been in
In such an early song
I've heard a rumour from Ground Control
Oh no, don't say it's true
They got a message from the Action Man
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too
I've loved all I've needed to love
Sordid details following"
The nothing is killing
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis
Ain't got no money, ain't got no hair
But I hope to kick but the planet it's glowing

[Chorus]
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

[Verse 2]
Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels keep following me
Oh no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too"
One flash of light, but no smoking pistol
I never did good things
I never did bad things
I never did anything out of the blue, no
I want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now

[Chorus]
Ashes to ashes, fun to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

[Outro]
My mother said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mother said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mother said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mother said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
Oh wonderful little drummer

[Intro]
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo

You've got your mother in a whirl
She’s not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let’s go out tonight
You like me, and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on

Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel Rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so!

[Bridge]
Don't ya?
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo

You've got your mother in a whirl cause she's
Not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair’s alright
Hey babe, let’s stay out tonight
You like me, and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I’m wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on

Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress

Rebel Rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so!

[Bridge]

You’ve torn your dress, your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?

So what you wanna know
Calamity's child, chi-chi, chi-chi
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you? Looks like you've been there too
Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh, how could they know?
Eh, eh

This is a song we haven't done, oh for so long
Just this last week, this is the first time we've done it
For a long time
Join us

[Refrain]
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop

[Verse 1]
Don't let me hear you say
Life's taking you nowhere, angel
(Come get up, my baby)
Look at that sky, life's begun
Nights are warm and the days are young
(Come get up, my baby)

[Chorus 1]
There's my baby, lost that's all
Won't somebody save her little soul
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Come get up, my baby

[Verse 2]
Last night they loved you
Opening doors and pulling some strings, angel
(Come get up, my baby)
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back, walk tall, act fine
(Come get up, my baby)

[Chorus 2]
I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years
Golden years
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop

[Verse 3]
One of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car twenty foot long
(Come get up, my baby)
Don't cry my sweet, don't break my heart
Doing all right, but you gotta get smart
Wish upon, wish upon, day upon day
I believe, oh Lord, I believe all the way
(Come get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years

[Chorus 1]
Won't somebody save her little soul
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Come get up, my baby

[Bridge]
Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
(Come get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years

[Chorus 2]
I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years
Golden years
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop

[Verse 1]
We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I was not there
He said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise
I spoke into his eyes, "I thought you died alone
A long long time ago"

[Chorus]
Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Verse 2]
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
At all the millions here
We must have died alone
A long long time ago

[Chorus]
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Chorus]
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Non-Lyrical Outro]

[Spoken Intro]
Come on, girl

[Verse]
Hallo Spaceboy
You're sleepy now
Your silhouette, so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I want to be free
Don't you want to be free?
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But Moondust will cover you
Cover you
This chaos is killing me

[Chorus]
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
This chaos is killing me

[Verse]
Spaceboy
You're sleepy now
Your silhouette

Your silhouette is so stationary
You're released but your custody calls

It's confusing these days
But Moondust will cover you
Cover you
This chaos is killing me

[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Now Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But he made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's Band

[Verse 2]
Ziggy really sang
Screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could kill 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
Came on so loaded man
Well hung, snow white tan

[Chorus 1]
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
Oh Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were Voodoo
The kids was just crass
He was the naz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But boy could he play guitar

[Chorus 2]
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed a man
I had to break up the band

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
Oooh
Oh hohoo

[Outro]
Ziggy played guitar

[Spoken Intro]
What a wonderful evening, please be safe
I really mean it, we really love you a lot
We really do

[Verse 1]
Johnny's in America
Lo-Teks at the wheel
No one needs anyone
They don't even just pretend
Johnny's in America

[Chorus]
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans
Johnny's in America

Johnny wants a plane
Johnny wants to suck on a Coke
Johnny wants a woman
Johnny wants to think of a joke
Johnny's in America

[Chorus]
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans

[Verse 3]
Johnny's in America
Johnny looks up at the stars
Johnny combs his hair
And Johnny wants pussy and cars
Johnny's in America
Johnny's in America

[Chorus]
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans

[Interlude]
God is an American

I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
Yeah, I'm afraid of Americans

[Spoken Outro]
Thank you, God bless, good night

[Verse 1]
Where did you come from?
And how are you so real?
I'm so afraid of you and the love that I reveal

I feel like I know you
You walk with such grace
How could I let your little heart go and be misplaced?

[Chorus]
I’ll do my best to give a girl like you
A place to rest from it all
It may not be much but you are sweet to the touch
In my arms when I hold you my dear
My dear

[Verse 2]
Where did she come from?
And how is she so real?
I'm so afraid of her and the love that I reveal
How could I know her
She walks with such grace
I won't let her little heart go and be misplaced

[Chorus]
’Cause I'll do my best to give a girl like you
A place to rest from it all
It may not be much but she's sweet to the touch
In my arms when I hold her my dear
My dear

[Verse 1]
I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
Those ocean eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those, give me those, give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those, give me those, give me those eyes

[Verse 2]
I've been walking through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
You left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
Those ocean eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those, give me those, give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those, give me those, give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those, give me those, give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those, give me those, give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those, give me those, give me those eyes

[Verse 1: Matty Healy & Tim Healy]
When you're in love, but you don't know what to do with it
When blackness hangs overhead like a cloud

[Chorus: Matty Healy & Tim Healy]
Don't worry, darling, 'cause I'm here with you
Don't worry, darling, the sun will shine through

[Verse 2: Matty Healy & Tim Healy]
When you wake up and you don't know what day it is
When the pain flows through your heart and your bones

[Chorus: Matty Healy & Tim Healy]
Don't worry, darling, 'cause I'm here with you
Don't worry, darling, the sun will shine through

[Verse 3: Tim Healy & Matty Healy]
When you feel no one knows just what you're going through
When your insides feel much colder than snow

[Chorus: Matty Healy & Tim Healy]
Don't worry, darling, 'cause I'm here with you
Don't worry, darling, oh, don't worry, darling
Don't worry, darling, I'll always love you

[Outro: Matty Healy]
You

[Intro: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9"]
"I've always looked at battle rap as competition or war, and the main objective is to destroy, completely fuckin’ obliterate your opponent by saying anything and everything, whatever the fuck you can, to get a reaction from the crowd. So nothing's off limits."
I need you to spit that lyrical miracle… in the swimming pool

[Verse 1]
Before this kicks off, let me set my balls on this tees
'Cause I’m dottin' i's every time I cross one of these
There's not a redeeming quality at all in me
It's impossible, seems like an implausible dream
Positive clean thoughts intervene
But they're all either altered and mean
Assault and demean, tossed and they're being lost in the scheme
Squashed in between a brainwashing machine
Like an Islamic regime, a jihadist extreme radical
Suicide bomber that's seeing
Ariana Grande sing her last song of the evening
And as the audience from the damn concert is leaving
Detonates the device strapped to his abdominal region
I’m not gonna finish that, for obvious reasons
But bring your dogs, I’ma muzzle 'em
I’m not Middle Eastern but I'll make a bitch rock a hijab
And at least a extra large in a T-shirt
Headscarf and a piece of tarp underneath the carpet, hasta la vista
I go Hamas on the beats, a paradox on the beach
And a pair of crotchless underwear on a terrorist watch list
Gettin' head in the sand like an embarrassed ostrich
Professional shit sprayer
Bitch watch who you talkin' to, like Apple wristwear
Endangered species in this ABC shit a bit scarce
Prey’s decreasing, I face extinction like disc players
Told this chick she's hot as Jada Pinkett
And just stared 'til I made her think it
Said, "Maybe we should just get married."
She's facing me, I placed my feet with my hips square
Tell her, "Turn around," spread her legs for me, then I hit bare
Leave her stretched out like a baby T-shirt on Ric Flair
As I rip, tear, anal beads in a split rear
Spray Febreze in the chick's hair
Make her wheeze tryna get air
I played for keeps, there's no escaping me, I have a bitch scared
And chained to me, and throw away the key
And she'll be so afraid to leave
That even if she ends up breaking free she'll just sit there
Tryin' to scrape up enough courage and strength to get up
It's impossible like rapin' a slut
We stay butt-naked and fuck
You're close, wait for you, what?
My idea, you comin' too, is waking you up
With smelling salts after I Quaalude your cup
That'll straighten you up if you try to stray like a pup
Hate to get bogged down in details
But bitch, I'm like the dog pound with females
My brain is corrupt, real life, Hillside Strangler
I strangle a skank's neck 'til it's triangular
Shaped but it's upside down, and my mouth ain't gonna shut
And mention me in your raps if it makes you a buck
Or helps you rake in the ducats, I want payment in pub
'Cause I ain't tryna get in your bars like I'm waiting the club
But if you put me in your lines, I'm takin' a cut

[Verse 2]
Get a million writers inside of a room combined in it
Try to get every idea of every possible line to spit
Every punchline, every combination that rhymes with it
Bitch, a whole team can't see me, there's no I's in it
Head so big, I shot myself ten times in it
Tryna commit suicide and it took five minutes
And I survived this shit
Someone's gonna challenge me, who?
Battle me and win, that's a fucking fallacy too
You name one motherfucker in this galaxy, *spits*, reality
You fantasy, rally your troops, try to boost the morale
Only time I start a movement's a bowel
I can't even give a "yeah" or a "woo" when you rap in the booth
Not even a "nah" or a "boo"
'Cause even though I'm allergic to the crap that you spew
When I'm 'bout to break out, I don't mean get a rash from it too
'Cause when I say I have allergies, I actually do
But that's just an analogy, I've never had a reaction to you

[Verse 3]
Creature from the Black Lagoon
I reach up and I smack the moon
You're grief struck that I'm back so soon
Your teacher for this afternoon
Creep up with a pack of hoodlums
We pack a punch like Caprisun
Heat tucked like we each snuck in a sub-machine gun
We stuck in a submarine bun, with a bag of shrooms
Cup of lean up in the padded room
Justin Bieber in a Catholic school
Selling dust and reefer when your back is to him
Don't adjust your speaker
I'll cuss the stripes off of a fuckin' zebra when I'm at the zoo
Huffin' cleaner 'til I gag from fumes
Fuck Christina with a plastic spoon
While I bump some G-Funk and blast some Snoop
'Cause her double G-cups are massive, huge!
It's fun for me just to grab a boob
Plus my penis got an attitude
My fuckin' wiener's in a combative mood
Come and suck a mean one like it's mad at you
I speak tongue-in-cheek, what you asslicks do
'Cause you love to eat butt, it's sad but true

[Verse 4]
I just sprung a leak suddenly
What I think in my gut instinct become in sync
My thoughts and my stomach link up with each other
Ink touches the pad, then boom!
Since the day Dre gave me beats, I was made elite
That's basically what makes me me
Creating stink, 'til these tats are fading ink
Who's the greatest? Think we're still debating, wink
ADD, and better put out an APB
'Cause it'll take LAPD and me layin' in the street
For you to see Shady beat
And I'll bet ya they'd need cleats
'Cause I'd have to be stomped by forty men to suffer a defeat
I pray please Jesus to make me decent
Inhaling the main ingredient of pain relievers, and saline
I take three Aleves, tryna break these fevers, I'm ailing
I stay free of divas and ladies screamin'
'Cause they keep schemin' on me
Vading keepin' the women at bay
Like Laci Peterson, baby fetuses
Legs and feet have been weighted, chained in semen
It's straight demon—and wait!
Even if it takes meat cleavers to make believers
Mistake-free schemes are enablin' me to remain deviant
Breakbeat, eat her like steak meat
Emcees take seats like AMC theaters
Deranged ringleader, depraved king
Who mainstream media hates
Which makes things easier, still under scrutiny
Villainous smooth criminal, livin' room
With the nude Reese Witherspoon
Who was bruised, beat with a broom
It's in two pieces, and lays deceased in it
Pit with a chewed leash, and his chain-link leapin' it
Live in the booth, shave, eat, bathe, drink, sleep in it
R-A-P bleed the shit, still and I poop, pee it
It's a spillage, a sewage leak, waist-deep feces
The syllables ooze fecal, they feel like renewed leases
'Cause my brain releases 'em

[Verse 5]
Like waste excretion, it's simultaneously
As I'm givin' these fools grief, they're feelin' the blues
'Cause even if stealin' my shoes, thieves
Just to fill 'em's a huge feat
A hill and it's too steep
Obey these demons, we're still in cahoots
Keep feedin' me blank sheets
As soon as I sank these teeth
And I'm killin' the loose leaf
Time to shake these trees again
Wait, make that phrase repeat again
Killin' the loose leaf, shake these trees again
Get the rake, but it ain't me leavin' 'em

[Verse 6]
Vicodins, Nuprins, I bite them and chew them
The whites and the blues mixed with nitrous balloons
And I like to sniff gluesticks, put Ricin on toothpicks
On the mic I'm just ruthless, a crisis, a nuisance
Who I influence I give two shits
If they wanna license my music to entice with
Then use the shit like it's the blueprint for ISIS recruitment

[Verse 7]
Excuse me while I stare into space for a few
In a daze or a haze, glazed over, crazed warped loon
Mental cased off, always had a straight-forward view
But you bozos keep givin' the flamethrower fuel
No one's ever sank lower, shrewd, and way more rude
Beast-mode like a lawn-mower blade rolled through it
And this has little to do with bein' gay, boy
It's just where the wordplay's goin'
But ain't much I can say or do
'Cause ain't no excuse, the way I go at you {censored}
You say I'm always screw-faced
So if I look your way, you're screwed
'Cause if looks could kill, I could start a hate war too
'Cause I'd murder you straight bitches by turnin' the gaze on you

[Verse 8]
Let's take it back before the tightly-worn pants
To the Nike, Jordan hats
The stripe Lee's, Jordache, and the white tees
Lightning storms might be formed fast
Such a frightening forecast
But when you're slightly hoarse, rasp
From the cyphering or gasp, but still reciting your raps
While you're tightening your grasp around the mic 'cause you done shitted on it so much, you're always reminded of your past
'Cause your heiny's sore, that's
'Cause you still haven't finished fuckin' wiping your ass
From the night before last
No good, but rap's somethin' I'm too-good-for-my-own-good at
Fuck adulthood, I'm a grown-up brat
Where your cojones at? Mine are always being rode, in fact
They're frozen, you ever seen a cul-de-sac?
So big they fell out my scrotum, I just sewed 'em back

[Verse 9]
Dick so long, need a shoulder-strap
For that, gotta unroll it and fold it back
So difficult to wrap in the prophylactic, it overlaps it
So I pack a Trojan so fat, when I lay it flat it's like a yoga mat
Make a bitch think she's in aerobics class
The bear you don't wanna poke is back
The backbone of rap, your fuckin' lead singles are my bonus tracks
When I appear, my peers stop
Hearts fall in their stomach, their spirits drop
Careers flop, their gears lock, severe shock
Fear at the mere thought
Lyrics are top-tier, I'm so high at the top
I'm in the sky when I talk
Bitch, I'm so fly when I walk, my ears pop

[Outro]
Oh, and I'm just playin' ladies, you know I love you
I got a idea for a line

[Snippet]
Ring-ring-a, ring-a-yeah
I need your face
I need your love and attention
And things i cannot mention

[Verse 1]
Dusty is the road
Way down
Way down on the other side
Heaven ain't too far
When you're a dead man walking
Dead man walking down that road
Stars are falling from the sky
My feet are on fire
It's a crossroad baby to where you should go

[Chorus]
You gotta get down
Get down to the river
You gotta get down
Get down to the river
River

[Verse 2]
Bye goodbye
Baby bye bye
I've been running too long
I've been running too strong
Gotta get out
Green don't grow
In the snow
That's where I gotta be
She said to me
I gotta get out
Forever long
Nobody knows
Nobody knows
Gotta get out
Get out

[Chorus]
I gotta get down
Get down to the river
I gotta get down
Get down to the river
River

[Verse 1]
No rules, no rules
You said there were no rules
Your eyes familiar whirlpools
The doors right into you
And I'll let you in
No need to ask
I wanna bask in your everything
My chest exploding
My mind eroding
At the thought of you existing
Carved from the same tree
Made of the same stuff
I couldn’t even bluff
No flirting, no skirting on the edge
You were one with me already

[Chorus]
All you had to do was see me
Really see me
Recognize the workings of my mind
And then touch me
Like something holy
And then touch me
Like something that is now but could never be

[Verse 2]
And as you take a vow to never lie to me
All of my senses are screaming at me
My body one big lump of tingling, ah
Imagining you naked in front of me
Nothing to hide, just someone to hold
And then we let go
'Cause we always let go

[Chorus]
All you had to do was see me
Really see me
Recognize the workings of my mind
And then touch me
Like something holy
And then touch me
Like something that is now but could never be
Like something holy
And then touch me
Like something that is now but could never be

[Interlude]
Ha!
Hoo!
Hey!
Hey!
Ooh!
Hey!

[Bridge]
Wrapped up in the golden light of my bedroom
You take one look at me and I swoon
I'm here with you
It hasn’t been so easy being lonely
Oh, I'm here with you
It hasn't been so easy being lonely
Oh, I'm here with you
It hasn't been so easy being lonely
Oh, I'm here with you
It hasn't been so easy being lonely

[Outro]
Thank you for showing me (Ooh)
That I'm not alone
Thank you for showing me (Ooh)
That I’m not alone
Thank you for showing me (Ooh)
That I’m not alone
Thank you for showing me (Ooh)
That I'm never alone

[Verse]
Rubber Band
There's a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune
In the library garden Sunday afternoon
While a little chappie waves a golden wand

Rubber Band
In 1910 I was so handsome and so strong
My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long
And I loved a girl while you played teatime tunes
Dear Rubber Band, you're playing my tune out of tune

Oh

Rubber Band
Won't you play a haunting theme again to me
While I eat my scones and drink my cup of tea
The sun is warm but it's a lonely afternoon

Oh, play that theme
Rubber Band
How I wish that I could join your Rubber Band
We could play in lively parks throughout the land
And one Sunday afternoon, I'd find my love

Rubber Band
In the '14-'18 war I went to sea
Thought my Sunday love was waiting home for me
And now she's married to the leader of your band, oh

[Outro]
Oh yeah... I hope you break your baton

[Intro]
La la la la la la, la la la la la la la
A winter's day, a bitter snowflake on my face
My summer girl takes little backward steps away

Jack Frost took her hand and left me, Jack Frost ain't so cool

[Chorus]
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat that's red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat because I feel cold

And when she smiles, the ice forgets to melt away
Not like before, her smile was warming yesterday
See the trees like silver candy, feel my icy hand

[Chorus]
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat that's red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat because I feel cold
See my eyes, my window pane
See my tears like gentle rain
That's a memory of the summer day

[Chorus]
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat that's red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat because I feel cold

Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat that's red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat because I feel cold

[Outro]
La la la la la la 

[repeat]

[Verse 1]
Just look through your window, look who sits outside
Little me is waiting, standing through the night
When you'll walk out through your door I’ll wave my flag and shout

[Chorus]
Oh, beautiful baby
My burning desire started on Sunday
Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday

[Bridge]
Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch
Don’t be afraid it's only me, hoping for a little romance
If you lie beneath my shade, I'll keep you nice and cool

[Verse 2]
Oh, beatiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's never-ending and I'll love you till Tuesday
Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me
I shall always watch you until my love runs dry

[Chorus]
Oh, beautiful baby
My heart's a flame, I’ll love you till Tuesday
My head’s in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday

[Bridge]
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday

[Outro]
Well, I might stretch it till Wednesday

[Verse]
There is a happy land where only children live
They don't have the time to learn the ways Of you sir, Mr. Grownup
There's a special place in the rhubarb fields underneath the leaves
It's a secret place and adults aren't allowed there Mr. Grownup
Go away sir
Charlie Brown got's half a crown, he's going to buy a kite
Jimmy's ill with chicken pox, and Tommy's learned to ride his bike
Tiny Tim sings prayers and hymns, he's so small we don't notice him
He gets in the way but we always let him play with us
Mother calls, but we don't hear
There's lots more things to do
It's only 5 o'clock, and we're not tired yet
But we will be, very shortly
Sissy Steven plays with girls, someone made him cry
Tony climbed a tree and fell, trying hard to touch the sky
Tommy lit a fire one day, nearly burned the field away
Tommy's mum found out, but he put the blame on me and Ray
There is a happy land where only children live
You've had your chance and now the doors are closed sir, Mr. Grownup
Go away sir
Boo, de boo, de boo, de boo dup

[Verse]
War made him a soldier
Little Frankie Mear
Peace left him a loser
The little bombardier
Lines of worry appeared with age
Unskilled hands that knew no trade
Spent his time in the picture house
The little bombardier
Frankie drank his money
The little that he made
Told his woes to no man
Friendless, lonely days
Then one day, in the ABC
Four bright eyes gazed longingly
At the ice-cream in the hand of
The little bombardier
Sunshine entered our Frankie's days
Gone his worries, his hopeless maze
His life was fun and his heart was full of joy
Two young children had changed his aims
He gave them toffees and played their games
He brought them presents with every coin he made
Then two gentlemen called on him
Asked him for his name
Why was he friends with the children
Were they just a game?
Leave them alone or we’ll get sore
We've had blokes like you in the station before
The hand of authority said "no more" to
The little bombardier
Packed his bags, his heart in pain
Wiped a tear and caught a train
Not to be seen in the town again
The little bombardier

[Verse 1]
Here is the news
According the latest world population survey
The figures have reached danger point, my god
London 15 million 75 thousand
New York 80 million
Paris 15 million and 30
China 1000 million
Billington-Spa: lots

[Verse 2]
My studies include exophagy
I formed my own society
To crush the power of fecundity
The world will overpopulate
Unless you claim infertility
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah

[Verse 3]
We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives
I propose to give the pill
Free of charge to those that feel
That they are not infertible
The crops are few, the cattle gone
There's only one way to linger on
So who will buy a drink for me, your
Messiah

[Verse 4]
Achtung, achtung, these are your orders
Anyone found guilty of consuming more than their
Allotted amount of air
Will be slaughtered and cremated
One only cubic foot of air is
I have prepared a document, legalising mass abortion
We will turn a blind eye to infanticide

[Verse 5]
You don't seem to hear me clear
Do I talk about your sphere?
Let me explain my project dear
Show you how I'll save the world
Or let it die within the year
Why do you look that way at me, your messiah

[Outro]
We are hungry men
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to eat you

[Verse]
When I live my dream, I'll take you with me
Riding on a golden horse
We'll live within my castle, with people there to serve you
Happy at the sound of your voice
Baby, I'll slay a dragon for you
Or banish wicked giants from the land
But you will find, that nothing in my dream can hurt you
We will only love each other as forever
When I live my dream
When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me
And the empty man you left behind
It's a broken heart that dreams, it's a broken heart you left me
Only love can live in my dream
I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish
Wish, and the storm will fade away
Wish again, and you will stand before me while the sky will paint an ouverture
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream
When I live my dream, please be there to meet me
Let me be the one to understand
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave
Then we can live in our new land
Till the day my dream cascades around me
I'm content to let you pass me by
Till that day, you'll run to many other men
But let them know it's just for now
Tell them that I've got a dream
And tell them you're the starring role
Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guy
And I'm going to make my dream
Tell them I will live my dream
Tell them they can laugh at me
But don't forget your date with me
When I live my dream

[Verse]
Mountains of Lhasa are feeling the rain
People are walking the Botella lanes
Preacher takes the school
One boy breaks a rule
Silly boy blue, blue, silly boy blue

Yak butter statues that melt in the sun
Cannot dissolve all the work you've not done
A chela likes to feel
That his overself pays the bill
Silly boy blue, blue, silly boy blue

You wish and wish, and wish again
You’ve tried so hard to fly
You'll never leave your body now
You've got to wait to die

La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
Silly boy blue, blue, silly boy blue
Child of the Tibet, you’re a gift from the sun
Reincarnation of one better man
The homeward road is long
You've left your prayers and song
Silly boy blue, blue, silly boy blue

Silly boy blue, blue, silly boy blue
Child of the Tibet, you're a gift from the sun
Reincarnation of one better man
The homeward road is long
You've left your prayers and song
Silly boy blue, blue, silly boy blue

[Chorus]
Smiling girls and rosy boys
Come and buy my little toys
Monkeys made of gingerbread
And sugar horses painted red

[Verse]
Rich men's children running past
Their fathers dressed in hose
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes
Gazing eyes and running wild
Past the stocks and over stiles
Kiss the window merry child
But come and buy my toys
You've watched your father plough the fields with a ram's horn
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn
Reaped it with a sharpened scyth, threashed it with a quill
The miller told your father that he'd work it with the greatest will
Now your watching's over you must play with girls and boys
Leave the parsley on the stalls
Come and buy my toys
You shall own a cambric shirt
You shall work your father's land
But now you shall play in the market square
Till you'll be a man

[Chorus]
Smiling girls and rosy boys
Come and buy my little toys
Monkeys made of gingerbread
And sugar horses painted red

[Verse]
Let me introduce you to the gang
Johnny plays the sitar, he's an existentialist
Once he had a name, now he plays our game
You won't feel so good now that you've joined the gang
Molly is the model in the ads
Crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip
Someone switched her on, then her beam went wrong
Because she can't switch off now that she's joined the gang
Arthur is a singer with a band
Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage
Look at Arthur rave, all the kids have paid
They want to see the croaking man who joined the gang
You won't be alone, we've all got beery grins
It's a big illusion but at least you're in
At least you're in
This club's called The Webb, it's this month's pick
Next month we shall find a place where prices ain't so stiff
15 bob a go, afraid that's past a joke
This is how to spend now that you've joined the gang
This is what to do now that you're here
Sit round doing nothing all together very fast
Psychedelic stars, throwing down cigars
They're picking up the joints now that they've joined the gang

[Verse 1]
She'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks on the house
She played a good game of darts, and the men slapped her back
And never took her out
She wore a trenchcoat khaki
Her hobnail boots were full of holes

[Chorus]
She's got medals

[Verse 2]
Her mother called her Mary, but she changed her name to Tommy, she's a one, oh
She went and joined the army, passed the medical
Don't ask me how it's done
They sent her to the front line
Fighting for her country's name

[Chorus]
She's got medals

[Verse 3]
She got very tired of picking up girls
Cleaning her gun and shaving her curls
Then the enemy dropped a bomb
Survivors there were none
People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed
You can see her ghost but that's a lie because the naughty woman isn't dead
She deserted on the previous morning
Replaced her uniform with dresses silk and green
Called herself Eileen
Came to London town
Now she's settled down

[Chorus]
She's got medals

[Verse]
This girl is made of lipstick
Powder and paint
Sees the pictures of herself
Every magazine on every shelf
This girl is maid of Bond Street
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs
This girl is a lonely girl
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus
Buys the Daily News
But passengers don't smile at her, don’t smile at her
This girl is made of loneliness
A broken heart
For the boy that she once knew
Doesn't want to know her any more
And this girl is a lonely girl
Every thing she wants is hers
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with
All the time, to love, all the time
This boy is made of envy
Jealousy
He doesn’t have a limousine
Really wants to be a star himself
This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films
Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor
And maids of Bond Street drive round in chauffered cars
Maids of Bond Street picture clothes, eyes of stars
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have worldly cares
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have love affairs

[Verse]
There's a little churchyard just along the way
It used to be Lambeth's finest array
Of tombstones, epitaphs, wreaths, flowers, all that jazz
Till the war come along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot
And in this little yard, there's a little old man
With a little shovel in his little bitty hand
He seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves
He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home
"Ah-choo, excuse me"
Please Mr. Gravedigger, don't feel ashamed
As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed
Please Mr. Gravedigger, I couldn't care
If you found a golden locket full of some girl's hair
And you put it in your pocket
"God, it's pouring down"
Her mother doesn't know about your sentimental joy
She thinks it's down below with the rest of her toys
And Ma wouldn't understand, so I won't tell
So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket
Yes, Mr. GD, you see me every day
Ah-choo!
Standing in the same spot by a certain grave
Mary-Ann was only 10 and full of life and oh so gay
And I was the wicked man who took her life away
Very selfish, oh God
No, Mr. GD, you won't tell
And just to make sure that you keep it to yourself
I've started digging holes my friend
And this one here's for you
"Lifted our girl, she apparently doesn't know of it
Hello misses, thought she'd be a little girl
Bloody obscene, (crikey) catch pneumonia or something in this rain..."

[Intro]

[Chorus 1]
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes

[Verse 1]
Here are we, one magical moment
Such is the stuff, from where dreams are woven
Bending sound, dredging the ocean
Lost in my circle
Here am I, flashing no color
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we, one magical movement
From Kether to Malkuth
There are, you drive like a demon
From station to station

[Chorus 1]
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers’ eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Making sure white stains

[Verse 2]
Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sun birds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
And oh, what will I be believing
And who will connect me with love?
Wonder who, wonder who, wonder when
Have you sought fortune, evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, drain your glass, raise your glass high

[Verse 3]
It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I’m thinking that it must be love

[Chorus 2]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is near

[Verse 4]
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her

[Chorus 2]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here

[Verse 5]
Should I believe that I’ve been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?

[Chorus 2]
It’s too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It’s too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late, It's too late
It’s too late, It's too late
It's too late, the European canon is near

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love

[Chorus]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here

[Verse 4]
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her

[Chorus]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here

[Verse 5]
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?

[Chorus]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late, the European canon is here

[Verse 1]
Hey man, oh leave me alone
Hey man, oh Henry, get off the phone
Hey man, I gotta straighten my face
This mellow thighed chick just put my spine out of place
I said hey man, my schooldays insane
Hey man, my work's down the drain
Hey man, well she’s a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she... then she...

[Chorus]
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh don’t lean on me man
Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
She's outta sight...she's all right

[Verse 2]
Hey man, Henry, don't be unkind, go away
Hey man, I can't take you this time, no way
Hey man, droogie don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes

[Chorus]
Oh don’t lean on me man
Cause you can’t afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you ain’t got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight...she's all right
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh don’t lean on me man
Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight...she's all right

[Outro]
A Suffragette City, a Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City, I'm back on Suffragette City
Ooo, Suffraggete city, ooo, Suffragette City
Oooh-how, Suffragette City, oooh-how, Suffragette City, oooh-how
Suffragette
Ohhh, wham bam, thank you Ma'am!
A Suffragette City, a Suffragette City
Quite all right
A Suffragette City
Too fine
A Suffragette City, ooh, a Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City, oh my Suffragette City
Oh, Suffragette
Suffragette!

What's your name?

[Verse 1]
In this age of grand delusion
You walked into my life out of my dreams
I don't need another change
Still you forced a way into my scheme of things
And you say we're growing
Growing heart and soul
In this age of grand delusion
You walked into my life out of my dreams
Oh sweet thing, you're born once again for me
Oh sweet thing, you're born once again for me
Oh sweet thing, I call you again
You're born once again for me
Just because I believe don't mean I don't think as well
Don't have to question everything in Heaven or Hell

[Chorus]
Lord, I kneel and offer you my word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Lord, Lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things?

[Verse 2]
In this age of grand delusion
You walked into my life out of my dreams
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Just as long as I can see
I'll never stop this vision flowing
I look twice
And you're still glowing
Just as long as I can walk
I'll walk beside you, I'm alive in you
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
And I'm ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh...

[Chorus]
Lord, I kneel and offer you, my word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among, your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Oh Lord, Lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
But it's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Lord, Lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things?

[Verse 1]
This week dragged past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could
Get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight

[Chorus]
Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is
Stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
Because you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

[Verse 2]
Heart wrecker, heart wrecker
Make me delight
Life is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

[Chorus]
Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is
Stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
Because you can never really tell
When somebody wants something or wants to
Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is
Stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
Because you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

[Chorus]
I'm waiting for the man
Twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington 1-2-5
So sick and dirty, more dead than alive
I'm waiting for the man

[Verse]
Hey white boy, what you doin' in town
Hey white boy, chasin' all the women around
Oh pardon me, sir, it's the last thing on my mind
I'm just looking for a good friend of mine
I'm waiting for the man
Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
Real shoes and a big straw hat
He's never early, he's always late
First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait
I'm waiting for the man
Big dirty building, up three flights of stairs
Nobody stops you 'cause nobody cares
He's got the works, gives you sweet taste
Then you gotta split because he's got no time to waste
I'm waiting for the man
Baby, don't you holler, darlin', don't you bawl and shout
I'm feeling good, I'm gonna work it on out
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling so fine
Until tomorrow but that's just another time
I'm waiting for the man

[Chorus]
I'm waiting for the man
Twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington 1-2-5
So sick and dirty, more dead than alive
I'm waiting for the man

To welcome me home

[Verse 1]
I'm up on the eleventh floor
And I’m watching the cruisers below
He's down on the street
And he's trying hard
To pull sister Flo
My heart’s in the basement
My weekend's at an all time low
Because she's hoping to score
So I can't see her
Letting him go
Walk out of her heart
Walk out of her mind

[Chorus]
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat
And bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

[Verse 2]
She's an old-time ambassador
Of sweet talking, night walking games
And she's known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it
Then she can do it
She don't make false claims
But she’s a Queen
And such are queens
That your laughter
Is sucked in their brains
Now she’s leading him on
And she'll lay him right down

[Refrain]
But it could have been me
Yes, it could have been me
Why didn’t I say
Why didn't I say, no, no, no

[Chorus]
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat
And bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

[Verse 3]
So I lay down a while
And I gaze at my hotel wall
Oh the cot is so cold
It don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah I lay down a while
And I look at my hotel wall
But he’s down on the street
So I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab
Because my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth
And it's no taste at all

[Refrain]
It could have been me
Oh yeah, it could have been me
Why didn't I say
Why didn't I say, no, no, no

[Chorus]
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat
And bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

[Verse 1]
Someday they won't let you
So now you must agree
The times they are a-telling
And the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, and the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage jaw of 1984

[Audience Cheers]

[Verse 2]
They'll split your pretty cranium, and fill it full of air
And tell that you're eighty, but brother, you won't care
You'll be shooting up on anything, tomorrow's never there
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984

[Chorus]
(Come see, come see, remember me?)
We played out an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 (Who could ask for more?)
1984 (Who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore?)
(Mor-or-or-or-ore)

[Verse 3]
I'm looking for a vehicle, I'm looking for a ride
I'm looking for a party, I'm looking for a side
I'm looking for the reason that I knew in '65
Beware the savage jaw of 1984

[Chorus]
(Come see, come see, remember me?)
We played out an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 (Who could ask for more?)
1984 (Who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore?)
(Mor-or-or-or-ore)

[Outro]
1984 (Who could ask for more?)
1984 (Who could ask for more?)
1984 (Who could ask for more?)

[Verse 1]
You always were the one that knew
They sold us for the likes of you
I always wanted new surroundings
A room to rent while the lizards lay crying in the heat
Trying to remember who to meet

[Bridge]
I would take a foxy kind of stand
While tens of thousands found me in demand

[Chorus]
When you rock and roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock and roll with me

[Verse 2]
Gentle hearts are counted down
The queue is out of sight and out of sounds
Me, I'm out of breath, but not quite doubting
I've found a door which lets me out!

[Chorus]
When you rock and roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody down here can do it for me
I'm in tears again

When you rock and roll with me
When you rock and roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
I said

When you rock and roll with me
When you rock and roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody here can do it for me
I'm in tears, yes
I'm in tears, yes
When you rock and roll with me

[Outro]
Yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Uh-huh-huh

[Audience Applause]

[Intro]
Hot damn!
Lucky he saw

(Yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay)

[Verse 1]
Well, you've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Well hey baby, your hair's alright
Hey baby, let's go out tonight
You like me, and I like it all
(Yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay)
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
(Yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay)
You want more and you want it fast

[Pre-Chorus]
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on

[Chorus]
Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel Rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so!

(Yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay)

Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel Rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so!

(Yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay)
Yeah!

You've torn your dress, your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
And your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
It's just a ravenous town
It's just where you wanna go

[Outro]
But you're a rebel rebel
But you're a rebel rebel

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
I'm an alligator
I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm a space invader
I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut
You're squawking like a pink monkey bird
And I'm busting up my brains for the words

[Chorus]
I said keep your 'lectric eye on me baby
(Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
(Love, love, love, love)
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Don't fake it baby
Lay the real thing on me
The church of man, love
Is such a holy place to be
Don't fake it baby
Make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air

[Chorus]
Keep your 'lectric eye on me baby
(Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
(Love, love, love, love)
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah

[Instrumental Interlude]

Keep your 'lectric eye on me baby
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
I freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah!
Keep your 'lectric eye on me baby
(Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
(Love, love, love, love)
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah!

Part I: Sweet Thing

[Audience Clapping]

[Verse 1]
It's safe in the city to love in a doorway
To strangle some screams from the dawn
And isn't it me, putting pain in a stranger?
Like a portrait in flesh, who trails on a leash
Will you see that I'm scared and I'm lonely?
So I'll break up my room, and yawn and I
Run to the centre of things
Where the knowing one says:

[Chorus]
"Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing
Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here then
For hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing"

[Verse 2]
I'm glad that you're older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile, isn't that me?
I'm in your way, and I'll steal every moment
If this trade is a curse, then I'll bless you
And turn to the crossroads of Hamburgers, and

[Guitar Solo]

Part II: Candidate

[Verse 1]
I'll make you a deal like any other candidate
We pretend we're walking home for your future's sake
My set is amazing, it even smells like the street
There is a bar at the end where I could meet you and your friend
Someone scrawled on the wall "I smell the blood of les tricoteuses"
Who wrote up scandals in other bars
They're having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumors and lies and stories they made up
Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that you never been seen
But there's a shop on the corner selling papier mache
Making bullet-proof faces Charles Manson, Cassius Clay
If you want it, boys get it here then

[Verse 2]
So you scream out of line
"Anyone out there? Anytime?
Tres bunch little number whines "Hey girlie, I want you
When it's good it's really good and when it's bad I go to pieces"
If you want it, boys, get it here then
On the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I put all I have in another bed
On another floor, in the back of a car
In the cellar of a church with the door ajar
Well, I guess we must be looking for a different kind
But we can't stop trying til we break up our minds
'Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights
Who press on the ground while shaking in fright
I guess we could cruise down one more time
With you by my side, it should be fine
We'll buy some drugs and watch a band
Then jump into a river holding hands

[Saxaphone Solo]

Part III: Sweet Thing

[Bridge]
Is it nice in your snow storm
Freezing your brain?
Do you think that your face looks the same?
Then let it be
It's all I ever wanted
It's a street with a deal
And a taste
It's got claws
It's got me
It's got you

[Piano Outro]

[Verse 1]
I still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
How the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

[Verse 2]
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that they shit on
As they try to change their worlds
Ooh, they're immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time

[Bridge]
Strange fascination, fascinating me
Oh, changes are taking the pace I'm going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Oh, look out all you rock 'n rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

[Outro]
I said that time, time, time, time!
But I can't trace time

[Verse 1]
Hey man, oh leave me alone you know
Hey man, oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
Hey man, I gotta straighten my face
This mellow thighed chick just put my spine out of place
Hey man, my schooldays insane
Hey man, my work's down the drain
Hey man, well she’s a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she... then she...

[Chorus]
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh don’t lean on me man
Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight...she's all right

[Verse 2]
Hey man, Henry, don't be unkind, go away
Hey man, I can't take you this time, no way
Hey man, droogie don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes

[Chorus]
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you can’t afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh don’t lean on me man
Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight...she’s all right
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you ain’t got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight...she's all right

[Outro]
A Suffragette City, a Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City, I'm back on Suffragette City
Ooo, Suffraggete city, ooo, Suffragette City
Oooh-how, Suffragette City, oooh-how, Suffragette City, oooh-how
Suffragette
Ohhh, wham bam, thank you Ma'am!
A Suffragette City, a Suffragette City
Quite all right
A Suffragette City
Too fine
A Suffragette City, ooh, a Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City, oh my Suffragette City
Oh, Suffragette
Suffragette!

[Verse 1]
Watching him dash away
Swinging an old bouquet (Dead roses)
Sake and strange divine
Uh-huh-huh-uh-huh-huhh (You'll make it)
Passionate bright young things
Takes him away to war (Don't fake it)
Sadden glissando strings
Uh-huh-huh-uh-huh-huhh (You'll make it)

[Chorus]
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Battle cries and champagne
Just in time for sunset
Who will love Aladdin Sane?

[Verse 2]
Motor sensational
Paris or maybe hell (I'm waiting)
Clutches of sad remains
Waits for Aladdin Sane (You'll make it)

[Chorus]
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain
Just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?

Will love Aladdin Sane
Will love Aladdin Sane

[Piano Solo]

[Chorus]
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain
Just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?

Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane
Will love Aladdin Sane

They say the lights are oh so bright on Broadway
They say there's always music in the air (Broadway)
On Broadway (Broadway)

[Intro]
Ooh
Oh
Ooh
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-why-why-why
Now

[Verse 1]
Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25
Don't want to stay alive when you're 25

[Verse 2]
Lucy's stealing clothes from unlocked cars
Freddy's got spots from ripping off stars from his face
A funky little boat race

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh television man is crazy
Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
Oh man, I need a TV when I've got T. Rex
Hey, brother, you guessed
I'm a dude

[Chorus]
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news

[Verse 3]
Now Jimmy's looking sweet though he dresses like a queen
He can kick like a mule
It's a real mean team
We can love
Oh yes, we can love

[Verse 4]
And my brother's back at home
With his Beatles and his Stones
We never got it off on that revolution stuff
It was such a drag
Too many snags

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I drunk a lot of wine
And I'm feeling fine
Gonna race some cat to bed
Is this concrete all around
Or is it in my head?
Oh, brother, you guessed
I'm a dude

[Chorus]
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I've seen all the rest of my Hollywood Highs
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had
I'm stiff on my legend, the films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty cause you just got paid

[Chorus]
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh stay, please stay, please stay

[Verse 2]
You found yourself a trick down on Sunset and Vine
But since he pinned you baby you're a porcupine
You sold me illusions and a bag full of cheques
You've made a bad connection cause I just want your sex

[Chorus]
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh yeah
Stay
Stay just for a day

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
Shakey threw a party that lasted all night
Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old fashioned band of married men
Looking up to me for encouragement - it was so-so
The ladies looked bad but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmied and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better - it was so-so
Yea! it was time to unfreeze
When the Reverend Alabaster danced on his knees
Slam! so it wasn't a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame

[Chorus]
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man
He walks like a jerk
But he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune

[Verse 2]
A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands
So Shakey hung him up to dry
The pundits were joking the manholes were smoking
And every bottle battled with the reason why
The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone
A throw back from someone's LP
A lemon in a bag played the Tiger Rag
And the bodies on the screen stopped bleeding
Yeah! I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldn't understand the conversation
Yeah! I ran to the street, looking for information

[Chorus]
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man
He walks like a jerk
But he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune

[Outro]
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna lose, the good thing, that I've got
If I do, I will surely, I will lose a lot

[Chorus]
For your love, is better than any love other I've known
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I'd better knock on wood
Baby

[Verse 2]
I got superstitious, about you, but I can't take a chance
You got me spinning, baby, spinning in a trance

[Chorus]
But your love, is better, than any other love I've known
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock on wood
Yeah!

[Verse 3]
It's no secret, but that woman fills my lovin' cup
She seems, so ready, that I can't get enough

[Chorus]
And her love, is better, than any other love I've known
It's like thunder, it's like lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock on wood
Baby, oh yeah

Better, yes, better
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Yes, I better
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Oh, knock on wood
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) You know I would, would
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) It's no secret

(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) No, oh, better
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Above me
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) I can't leave her
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Oh no, baby

Knock on wood, woo!

[Verse 1]
As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Tod Browning's Freak you was
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I know you're not protected, for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal

[Chorus]
(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

[Verse 2]
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, oh Tarzan, go man go
Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed, Diamond Dogs are stabilised

[Chorus]
(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Call them the diamond dogs
Call them the diamond dogs

[Verse 3]
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
(There's gonna be sorrow) Try and wake up tomorrow

[Chorus]
(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

[Outro]
(Oo-oo-ooh) Call them the Diamond Dogs
(Oo-oo-ooh) Call them the Diamond Dogs
(Oo-oo-ooh) Call them the Diamond Dogs
Ooh, yeah baby, call them the diamond
Call them the Diamond
(Oo-oo-ooh) Call them the Diamond Dogs
Yeah-heh-heh
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, they call them
(Oo-oo-ooh) Call them the Diamond Dogs
(Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs)
Keep cool
Diamond Dogs rule, OK
Hey-hey-hey-hey
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs

[Verse 1]
Don't talk of dust and roses
Or should we powder our noses?
Don’t live for last year's capers
Give me steel, give me steel, give me pulsars unreal
We'll build a glass asylum
With just a hint of mayhem
We’ll build a better whirlpool
We'll be living from sin
Then we can really begin

[Bridge]
Please saviour, saviour, show us
Hear me, I'm graphically yours

[Chorus]
Someone to lead us, someone to follow
Someone to fool us, some brave Apollo
Someone to shame us, someone like you
We want you Big Brother, Big Brother

[Verse 2]
I know you think you're awful square
But you made everyone and you've been every where
Lord I think you'd overdose if you knew what's going down

[Chorus]
Someone to lead us, someone to follow
Someone to fool us, some brave Apollo
Someone to shame us, someone like you

Someone to lead us, someone to follow
Someone to fool us, some brave Apollo
Someone to shame us, someone like you

Someone to lead us, someone to follow
Someone to fool us, some brave Apollo
Someone to shame us, someone like you

[Outro]
Mother
Hoo, hoo
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up
Mother
Hoo, hoo
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up
Mother
Hoo, hoo
Shake it up, shake it up

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me

[Verse 2]
Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked Why not?" and I replied "I don't know
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped Khalil Gibran
And I cried for all the others untill the day was nearly through
For I realized that God’s a young man too

[Verse 3]
So I said "So long" and I waved bye-bye
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said, you'll never go down to the Gods again
(Turn around, go back!)
He struck the ground, a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said, do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back!)
His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said, do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back!)
Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed
Waiting for you

[Instrumental]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go, and everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie

(Get back one)

[Chorus]
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Sits like a man, but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie

[Chorus]
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
He's so simple minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved
Loves to be loved

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go

Go
Go, go

[Chorus]
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go, go

[Outro]

[Instrumental Intro]

[Chorus 1]
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes

[Verse 1]
Here are we, one magical moment
Such is the stuff, from where dreams are woven
Bending sound, lost in my circle
Dredging the ocean
Here am I, flashing no color
Tall in my room overlooking the ocean
Here are we, one magical movement
From Kether to Malkuth
There are you, you drive like a demon
From station to station

[Chorus 1]
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Making sure white stains

[Verse 2]
Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sun birds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
And oh, what will I be believing
And who will connect me with love?
Wonder who, wonder who, wonder when
Have you sought fortune, evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, raise your glass, raise your glass high

[Verse 3]
It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love

[Chorus 2]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is near

[Verse 4]
I must be only one in a million
'Cause I can't pass a day without her

[Chorus 2]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here

It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Yeah, it's too late
(Whoo-hoo) It's too late
(Whoo-hoo) It's too late
(Whoo-hoo) It's too late
The European canon is here
And yes, it's too late
(Whoo-hoo) It's too late
(Whoo-hoo) It's too late
(Whoo-hoo) It's too late
The European canon is here
And yes, it's too late
(Whoo-hoo) It's too late
(Whoo-hoo) It's too late
(Whoo-hoo) It's too late
The European canon is here

[Outro]
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Making sure white stains

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, still you forget
Now, you're a rock ’n' roll suicide

[Verse 2]
You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you don’t eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

[Verse 3]
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural, religiously unkind

[Chorus]
Oh no love! You’re not alone
You’re watching yourself but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up
But if I could only make you care
Oh no love! You’re not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, now I’ll help you with the pain
You're not alone!

[Outro]
All you got to do is chant along with me
All you've gotta do is turn on me
All you've gotta do is give me your hands
You're wonderful, wonderful
Wonderful, wonderful
Oh, you're wonderful

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
Well she's a tongue twisting storm
She’ll come to the show tonight
Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey not my money
She's a funky-thigh collector
Laying on electric dreams

[Chorus]
Well come on, well come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well come on, well come on
If you think we’re going to make it
You better hang on to yourself

[Verse 2]
Oh we don't dance, we don't talk much
We just ball and play
But then we move like tigers on Vaseline
Even though the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the Blessed
We're The Spiders From Mars

[Chorus]
Well come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well come on, well come on
If you think we're going to make it
You better hang on to yourself

[Bridge]
Come on

[Chorus]
Well come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well come on, well come on
If you think we’re going to make it
You better hang on to yourself

Well come on, come on
We’ve really got a good thing going
Well come on, well come on
If you think you're going to make it
You better hang on to yourself
Oh come on

[Outro]
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah

Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, hey

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
Tony went to fight in Belfast
Rudi stayed at home to starve
I could make it all worthwhile
As a rock and roll star
Bevan tried to change the nation
Sonny wants to turn the world, well he can tell you that
He tried
I could make a wild mutation as a rock & roll star

[Chorus]
So inviting
So enticing to play the part
I could make a transformation
As a rock and roll star
Ooh yeah
I could do with the money
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
I’d send my photograph to my honey and I'd c'mon like
A regular superstar
I could play the wild mutation
So inviting
So enticing to play the part
I could make it all worthwhile
As a rock and roll star
Get it on yeah, ooh
Ooh yeah
I could do with the money
I’m so wiped out with things as they are
I'd send my photograph to my honey - and I'd c'mon like
A regular superstar

[Verse 2]
I could fall asleep at night
As a rock and roll star
I could fall in love all right
As a rock and roll star

[Outro]
Rock and roll star
Rock and roll star

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
Oh yeah
Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And The Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's Band

[Verse 2]
Ziggy really sang
Screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
Oh he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
He came on so loaded man
Well hung, snow white tan

[Chorus 1]
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?

[Verse 3]
Oh yeah
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were Voodoo
The kids was just crass
He was the naz
With God-given ass
Well he took it all too far
But boy could he play guitar

[Chorus 2]
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like some leper messiah
When the kids had killed a man
I had to break up the band
Oh yeah
Oh-ooh-hoo

[Outro]
And Ziggy played guitar

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
Pushing through the market square
So many mothers sighing
News had just come over
We had five years left to sighing
News guy wept and told us
Earth was really dying
Cried so much that his face was wet
Then I knew he wasn't lying
I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw toys and boys, and electric irons and TVs
My brain hurt like a warehouse
It had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store
Everything in there
And all the fat, skinny people
And all the tall, short people
All the somebody people
All the nobody people
I never thought I’d need so many people

[Verse 2]
A girl my age went off her head
Hit some tiny children
If the Black hadn't pulled her off
I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that
And I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour
Drinking milk shakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Don't think you knew you were in this song
It was cold and it rained, and I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race
The way that you talk
I kiss you, you’re beautiful
I want you to walk

[Outro]
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
Five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
Five years
Five years
Five years

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
Stone love, she kneels before the grave
A brave son who gave his life
To save the slogans
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving
New love, a boy and girl are talking
New words that only they can share in
New words, a love so strong it breaks their hearts
To sleep through the fleeting hours of morning

[Chorus]
Love is careless in its choosing
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will cause confusion
Inspirations have I none
Just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love
And love is not loving
{​Bridge}​

[Verse 2]
Soul love, the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love and how my God on high is
All love though reaching up my loneliness
Evolves by the blindness that surrounds him

[Chorus]
Love is careless in its choosing
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will cause confusion
Inspirations have I none
Just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love
And love is not loving

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Soul love, soul love
La-la, la-la-la-la-la-la

La-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Soul love

[Verse 1]
Fame makes a man take things over
Fame lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame puts you there where things are hollow
Fame

[Chorus]
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane
Fame

[Verse 2]
Fame what you like is in the limo
Fame what you get is no tomorrow
Fame what you need you have to borrow
Fame

[Chorus]
Fame, it's not the flame, it's just his game
Enough to keep you insane
Fame

[Refrain]
Sha-be-do-da-day, sha-be-de
Sha-be-do
Sha-be-do-da-day, sha-be-de
Sha-be-do

[Verse 3]
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder you're far too cool to fool
Fame

[Chorus]
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a rain check on pain
Fame

[Outro]
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame

Never mind, say something
Wait until the crowd cries
Oh, wait until the crowd cries
You're just a little girl with grey eyes

So deep in your room
You never leave your room

Yearning deep inside of me
Talking through the gloom
What in the world can I do
What in the world can I do
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love

[Verse 1]
Oh you, you walk on past
Your lips cut a smile on your face
(Your scalding face)
To the cage, to the cage
She was a beauty in a cage
It's too, too high a price
To drink rotting wine from your hands
(Your fearful hands)

[Verse 2]
Get me to a doctor’s, I've been told
Someone's back in town, the chips are down
I just cut and blackout
I’m under Japanese influence and my honour's at stake
The weather's grim, there's ice on the cages
Me, I'm Robin Hood, and I puff on my cigarette
Panthers are steaming, stalking, screaming

[Verse 3]
If you won't stay tonight
I will take that plane tonight
I've nothing to lose, nothing to gain
I'll kiss you in the rain, kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain, in the rain

[Bridge]
Get me to the doctor

[Outro]
Get me off the streets
(Get some protection)
Get me to my feet

Hot air gets me into a blackout
Get me off the streets
Get some protection
Oh get me on my feet (Wo-ooh!)
(Get me some protection)
Oh get me off the streets
Get me some protection
Oh get me on my feet
Give me some direction (Wo-ooh!)
While the streets block off
Getting some skin exposure to the blackout
(Get some protection)
Get me on my feet
Get some direction (Wo-ooh!)
Oh get me on my feet
Get me off the streets
Get some protection
Get me to my feet
Give me some direction (Wo-ooh!)

Weaving down a byroad
Singing the song

Gone wrong

My-my, smile at least
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast

Something in the night
Something in the day
Nothing is wrong but darling
Someone's in the way
There's slaughter in the air
Protest on the wind
Someone deep inside me
Someone could get skinned, how?

My-my, someone fetch a priest
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast, darling

[Verse 1]
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It is the grounding of a foot uncompromising
It's not forgoeing of the lie
It's not the opening of eyes
It's not the waking, it's the rising

[Verse 2]
It's not the shade, we should be past it
It's the light, and it's the obstacle that casts it
It's the heat that drives the light
It's the fire it ignites
It's not the waking, it's the rising

[Verse 3]
It's not the song, it is the singing
It's the hearing of a human spirit ringing
It is the bringing of the line
It is the baring of the rhyme
It's not the waking, it's the rising

[Chorus]
I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, lord
Nina cried power
Billie cried power
Mavis cried power
And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, lord
Curtis cried power
Patti cried power
Nina cried power

[Verse 4]
It’s not what’s in front but who’s beside you
It’s all that came before and what it provides you
All those that held the line
Who wouldn’t bow down and resign
It’s not the waking, it’s the rising

[Chorus: Hozier and Mavis Staples]
And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, lord
Nina cried power
James Brown cried power
Lennon cried power
And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Ah (Power, lord)
Joni cried power
Julie cried power
Nina cried power

[Bridge]
And I could cry power
Power has been cried by those stronger than me
Straight into the face that tells you
To rattle your chains if you love being free (power)

[Outro]
And I could cry power (power)
Power is my love when my love reaches to me (power, love)
James Brown cried power
Curtis cried power
Marvin cried power
Ah, power (power)
Power (power)
(Power, love)
Nina cried power, power, power
Nina cried power

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I've come on a few years from my Hollywood Highs
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had
I'm stiff on my legend, the films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty cause you just got paid

[Chorus]
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh stay, please stay, please stay

[Verse 2]
Caught yourself a trick down on Sunset and Vine
But since he pinned you baby you're a porcupine
You sold me illusions for a sack full of cheques
You've made a bad connection cause I just want your sex

[Chorus]
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
Oh show me the way to the next whiskey bar
Oh don't ask why, oh don’t ask why
For we must find the next whiskey bar
Or if we don't find the next whiskey bar

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die

[Chorus]
Oh moon of Alabama, it's time to say goodbye
We’ve lost our good old mama

[Outro]
You know why
You know why

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
Well she's a tongue twisting storm
She'll come to the show tonight
Praying to the light machines
She wants my honey not my money
She's a funky-thigh collector
Laying on electric dreams

[Chorus]
Come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Come on, Come on
If you think we're going to make it
You better hang on to yourself
Ooh, come on

[Verse 2]
We can't dance, we don't talk much
We just ball and play
But then we move like tigers on Vaseline
Well the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the Blessed
We're The Spiders From Mars

[Chorus]
Come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Come on, well come on
If you think we're going to make it
You better hang on to yourself

[Bridge]
Come on
Come on

[Chorus]
Come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Come on, well come on
If you think we're going to make it
You better hang on to yourself

Yeah, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well come on, come on
If you think we're going to make it
You better hang on to yourself

[Guitar Solo]
Come one baby

[Audience Applause]

[Intro]
Oh yeah
Ah

[Verse 1]
Now Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And The Spiders from Mars
Well he played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's Band

[Verse 2]
Ziggy really sang
Screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
Oh he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
Well he came on so loaded man
Well hung, snow white tan

[Chorus 1]
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?

Oh yeah!

[Verse 3]
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were Voodoo
The kids was just crass
He was the nazz
With God-given ass
But he took it all too far
But boy could he play guitar

[Chorus 2]
Making love with his ego (Oh, yeah)
Ziggy sucked up into his mind (Ah)
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed a man
I had to break up the band

Oh yeah
Oooh
Ohh-hoo-hoo

[Outro]
Now Ziggy played guitar

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
Shakey threw a party that lasted all night
Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old fashioned band of married men
Looking up to me for encouragement, it was so-so
The ladies looked bad but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmied and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better, it was so-so
Yeah! I began to unfreeze
When the Reverend Alabaster danced on his knees
Slam, so it wasn't a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame

[Chorus]
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man
Walks like a jerk
But he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune
Yeah

[Verse 2]
A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands
So Shakey hung him up to dry
The pundits were joking the manholes were smoking
And every bottle battled with the reason why
The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone
A throw back from someone's LP
A lemon in a bag played the Tiger Rag
And the bodies on the screen stopped bleeding
Yeah! I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldn't understand the conversation
Yeah! I ran to the street, looking for information

[Chorus]
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man
He walks like a jerk
But he's only taking care of the room
Well he must be in tune

[Outro]
Watch that man (Ha)
Watch that man (Hoo)
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned
Beneath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope
Into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one

[Verse 2]
Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village Dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh "It's the madness in his eyes"
As he breaks the night to cry:

[Verse 3]
It's really Me
Really You
And really Me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really You
And really Me
You'll lose me though I'm always
Really free

[Verse 4]
And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realize
Where the snow had saved a place
For the Wild Eyed Boy
From Freecloud

[Verse 5]
And the village Dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the Wild Eyed Boy
From Freecloud
And the women once proud
Clutched the heart of the crowd
As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand

[Verse 6]
And the Magic in the stare
Of the Wild Eyed Boy said
"Stop, Freecloud
They won't think to cut me down"
But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face
Of the Wise Boy
Came tumbling down
To the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peace/love
Stumbled back to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles
From the Freecloud mountain
Track

[Part I: Wiled Eyed Boy From Freecloud]

[Audience Cheering]

[Verse 1]
Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
The hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned
Beneath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope
Into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one

[Verse 2]
Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village Dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh "It's the madness in his eyes"
As he breaks the night to cry

[Verse 3]
It's really me
Really you
And really me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really you
And really me
You'll lose me though I'm always
Really free

[Part II: All The Young Dudes]

[Verse 1]
Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25
Don't want to stay alive when you're 25

[Verse 2]
Wendy's stealing clothes from unlocked cars
Freddy's got spots from ripping off stars from his face honey
A funky little boat race

[Pre-Chorus]
The television man is crazy
Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
But, man, I need a TV when I've got T. Rex
Hey, brother, you guessed
I'm a dude man

[Chorus]
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes, yeah
Carry the news
All the young dudes, yeah
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes, yeah
Carry the news

[Part III: Oh! You Pretty Things]

[Verse 1]
Wake up you sleepy head
Put on some clothes, shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee
Look out my window and what do I see
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

[Chorus]
Oh you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Oh you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior
1, 2...
Oh you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Oh you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior

[Audience Applause]

[Intro]
Ah
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 1]
I'm an alligator
I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm a space invader
I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut
You're squawking like a pink monkey bird
And I'm busting up my brains for the words

[Chorus]
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!

[Verse 2]
Don't fake it baby
Lay the real thing on me
The church of man, love
Is such a holy place to be
Don't fake it baby
Make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air if you dare

[Chorus]
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah

[Instrumental Break]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!

Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!

Freak out, far out, in out

[Guitar Solo]

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
I still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
Then I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Just wanted to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
Ooh yeah

[Verse 2]
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
Just the same, quite the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are they immune to your consultations?
They're quite aware of what they're going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame
Pretty soon you've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time

[Bridge]
Strange fascination, fascinating me
Changes are taking the pace I'm going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Look out you rock 'n rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

[Saxophone/Piano Outro]

[Audience Applause]

[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills
And put your helmet on
Ground Control to Major Tom
Commencing countdown
Engines on
Check ignition
And may God's love be with you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You’ve really made the grade
And the papers want to know who's shirt you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I’m stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
Now the stars look very different today

[Chorus]
For here am I sitting in my tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you

[Chorus]
Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there’s nothing I can do

[Instrumental Outro]

[Audience Applause/Cheering]

[Spoken Word: David Bowie]
Shhh...
Shh...

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Time, he's waiting in the wings
He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me, boy

[Verse 2]
Time, he flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me, boy

[Verse 3]
Time, in quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time

The sniper in the brain
Regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain
And many other last names
Well, I look at my watch it says 9:25 and I think
"Oh God! I'm still alive"

[Chorus]
We should be on by now
We should be on by now

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La

[Verse 4]
You are not a victim
You just scream with boredom
You are not evicting time

[Bowie Breathing Heavily]

[Verse 5]
Chimes, goddamn, you're looking old
You'll freeze and catch a cold
'Cause you've left your coat behind
Take your time

[Bridge]
Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams
I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind
But love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed
Your park was real and dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now
Smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was a guilt for dreaming

[Chorus]
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now

[Outro]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Yeah, time

[Audience Applause]

[Intro]
Uh!
Uh!

[Verse 1]
In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree
Well I looked and frowned and the monster was me

[Verse 2]
Well I said hello and I said hello
And I asked "Why not?" and I replied "I don't know"
So we asked a simple black bird who was happy as can be
Well he laughed insane and quipped Khalil Gibran
And I cried for all the others 'till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too
Ah just like you, just like you
Ah just like you

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
So I said "So long" and I waved bye-bye
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
Riding along
Ch'mon

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
No, my knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said, you'll never go down to the Gods again
(Turn around, go back!)
He struck the ground, a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
Oh we crashed a thousand yards below
I said, do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back!)
His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said, do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back!)
Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
I was seething, breathing deeply
Just a spitting sentry, horned and tailed
Waiting for you
Aha, yeah

[Instrumental Outro]

[Audience Applause]

[Spoken Word: David Bowie]
Good evening London
I'd like to introduce you to the Spiders from Mars
On bass guitar, we've got Trevor Bolder
And on percussive instruments and drums, Woody Woodmansey
No it's not Suzi Cuatro on lead guitar, we've got Mick Ronson!
This is for Mick...

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Well, don't you worry
About what's been on my mind
I'm in no hurry
I can take my time
I'm going red
And my tongue's getting tired
Out of my head and my mouth's getting dry
I'm h-h-h-high

[Chorus]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now

[Verse 2]
I feel so strong
That I can't disguise, oh my
Well, I just won't apologise, oh no
Don't put me down
We could have fun just by fooling around, and around
And around

[Chorus]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now

[Bridge]
You see I'm smiling baby
You need some guiding baby
I'm just deciding baby

[Chorus]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now

[Verse 3]
This doesn't happen to me every day (Oh no, no, no, no)
No excuses I've got anyway, hey (My-my-my-my-my)
I'll satisfy your every need
And I'll know you'll satisfy me

[Chorus]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever

[Verse 4]
Ah, they said we were too young
Our kind of love
Was no fun
But our love
Comes from above
Do it!
Let's make love
Ah!
Oh yeah!

[Chorus]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
Hey man, oh leave me alone you know
Hey man, oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta

This mellow thighed chick just put my spine out of place
Hey man, my schooldays insane
Hey man, my work's down the drain
Hey man, well she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she, then she

Hey man, Henry, don't be unkind, go away

There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes

[Chorus]
Oh don't lean on me man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket

Another vy guy tonight is in London somewhere making an album
And I think he's a friend of mine
And any way, he's one of the best songwriters out today
His name is Lou Reed
And this is one of his early things
It's called "White Light/White Heat"

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
(White light) White light gonna drive me out of my brain
(White light) White light gonna make me feel so insane
(White light) White heat shapin' them down to my toes
(White light) White light's got it now, goodness knows

[Verse 2]
(White light) White light gonna drive me out of my mind
(White light) White light's surely gonna make me blind
(White light) White heat shaping way down to my toes
(White light) White light could kill me now, goodness knows

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, white light
Oh, oh, white light
Oh, oh, white heat
Oh, oh, white heat

[Verse 3]
(White light) White light gonna drive me out of my brain
(White light) White light gonna make me feel so insane
(White light) White heat shapin' them down to my toes
(White light) White light's got it now, goodness knows

[Verse 4]
(White light) White light gonna drive me out of my mind
(White light) White light's surely gonna make me blind
(White light) White heat shaping way down to my toes
(White light) White light could kill me now, goodness knows

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, white light
Oh, oh, white light
Oh, oh, white heat
Oh, oh, white heat

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, white light
Oh, oh, white light
Oh, oh, white heat
Oh, oh, white heat

[Outro]
White light
Still feels right
What's that sound, what's that sound
Don't turn on, be dead or alive
No feeling
Here she comes
Ooh, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) Here she comes
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Audience Applause]

[Piano Intro]

[Verse 1]
Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, but still you forget
Oh oh, you're a rock ’n' roll suicide

[Verse 2]
You're too young to lose it, but you’re too old to lose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
When you you walk past the cafe, you can't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

[Verse 3]
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Don't let the sunlight blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float bind your mind
You’re so natural, religiously unkind

[Chorus]
Oh no love, you’re not alone
You're watching yourself but you’re too unfair
You got your head all tangled up
But if I could only make you care
Oh no love, you're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I’ve had my share, now I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone!
Just turn on with me and you're not alone
Just turn on with me and you're not alone (Wonderful)
Just gimme your hands 'cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
I said gimme your hands 'cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Gimme your hands 'cause your wonderful
Gimme your hands 'cause your wonderful
Gimme your hand
Gimme your hands
'Cause you're wonderful, gimme your hands
Gimme your hand baby

[Spoken Word Outro: David Bowie]
Thank you very much, we love you

[Audience Applause]

[Audio Recording of "Land Of Hope and Glory"]
(Intro)
Repeat after me
Baby forgive me for my trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
For all we say and lead me not into temptation
But deliver us from
The doghouse

(Verse 1)
Like a fool I played this game of love
Not to win it I'm just in its
You see my girl was out of town for about a week
That’s what I thought
Well I was wrong
Well temptation came knocking at my door
I accepted I regret it
Cause I knew it was the end I must pay for all my sins
How can it be can't believe that my girl walked in on me
Cause I was cold

(Chorus)
Baby I know (Baby I'm sorry)
That I’m all exposed (Yes I am)
She caught me with my shorts down
Now I can't get back
All of the good love
All the good lovin' I had
Taught me not to fool around
No matter what I do
You're always untrue
Why do you fool around?

(Verse 2)
It was cool oh so smooth I got so rude in the back of my room
Sheets nice and soft, will that get you off?
Well I knew that it was wrong but like a fool I carried on
Gave into sin
Then my girlie girl walked in
And i was cold

(Chorus)
Baby I know
That I'm all exposed (I'm all exposed)
Caught me with my shorts down (Girl what shall I do)
Now I can't get back
All the good lovin' I had

Taught me not to fool around
I can’t deny
(I can’t deny)
Thou shall not lie
(Thou shall not lie)
Caught me with my shorts down
What can I do?
(What can i do)
To make it up to you?
(To make it up to you?)
Taught me not to fool around
(Rap: The Poetess)
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
I ain't the one to be played so don’t be runnin' the games
It was silly of me to think that you would never cheat
I wasn't gone a week you couldn't wait to hit the sheets
Caught you with your shorts down you and I were later
You didn’t have to lie, hoe, you should have been straight up
I can take it cause I'm that woman
And now your all assed out cause you ain't got jack comin'
I must admit you had me fooled for a minute though
You had me it open it wasn't cool that was critical
Now get to steppin' with your flowers and your candy
It's over just in case you didn't understand me
Now here's the keys to your new crib (Doghouse)
Now think about the things that you did (Doghouse)
You're livin' foul and you're goin' out doggie style
That's why you're livin' in the doghouse now

(Verse 3)
Well I know the deeds one day will catch up with me
Whenever that day comes I'll have to deal with it
Well I know it might sound strange but I'll never change
Well girl I'm just the dog that likes to chase the cat

After all the things that I have done for you
I'm disgusted, it's you I trusted
Soon you'll realize that I was good for you
You'll regret it, so don't forget it
(Hook)
There's no doubt
(There's no doubt)
That I'm all assed out
(Can't you see that)
You caught me with my shorts down
What am I gonna do?
Come big or small
(Come big or small)
I gotta lock them drawers
(I gotta lock them drawers)
Teach me not to fool around
Go on baby you need to understand me

What can I do?
I'm all exposed?
I didn't think, I didn't think you'd find me out
I can't get back that sweet, sweet love
That sweet, sweet love
Come on baby
I guess I have to pay for all my sins today
After all

[Verse: Young Thug]

While I'm sleeping
Swimming in the living room like the deep end
All I ever needed was a alibi (yeah yeah)

I've drank some sweet cherry wine
I’ve slept through too many appointments
With would-be friends of mine

I think I feel just like Ty Cobb
I'm always on the job
I just can't seem to relax
And that’s not good

But if I had it to do
All over again
I guess I should have made more friends

Run through, run with me sister
Childlike and evergreen
When I get up in the morning
I'm gonna change everything

But if I had it to do
All over again

Muchisimas gracias amigos
Tenemos mucha suerte de estar aquí

[Verse 1]
I stole a key
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown, took what they offered me
To set me free
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
Saw the lights go down, and standing in front of me

[Chorus 1]
Is you

[Verse 2]
In my scarecrow dreams
When they smash my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting through concrete
Be a cartoon heart
Oh, and light a fire, a fire, a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart
We’ll run wild
We’ll be glowing in the dark

[Chorus 2]
Whoo-ooh
Glowing in the dark
Whoo, whoo

[Bridge]
All the boys, all the girls
All that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls
All the madness that occurs
All the highs, all the lows
As the room a-spinning goes
We’ll run riot
We’ll be glowing in the dark

[Interlude]
Manos, por favor, arriba
Sing, ruido
Vamos a saltar, a saltar
¡Uno, dos, tres, go!

[Outro]
So we’ll soar
Luminous and wired
We’ll be glowing in the dark
Estáis tan generoso
Muchisimas gracias con todo mi corazón

[Intro: Charlie Chaplin]
I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible; Jew, Gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world, there's room for everyone, and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. The kingdom of God is within man, not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people, have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure!
A wonderful adventure!

[Verse 1]
Oh, I think I landed
In a world I hadn't seen
When I'm feeling ordinary
When I don't know what I mean

[Verse 2]
Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
For the thirst and for the hunger
Come the conference of birds

[Chorus]
Saying it's true, it's not what it seems
Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams
You get a head, a head full of dreams
You can see the change you wanted
Be what you want to be
And you get a head, a head full of dreams
Into life, I’ve just been woken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

[Bridge]
Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
Now you've got me open-handed
Now you've got me lost for words
I sing oh, whoa, oh, oh
I sing oh, whoa, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, oh, oh

[Outro]
Full of dreams (Oh, whoa, oh, oh)
Into life, I’ve just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

[Intro]
Vamos a cantar juntos
Sing "E-yo" (E-yo)
Sing "E-yo" (E-yo)

[Verse 1]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
But I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning sees another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
Heaven is in sight
Yeah, woo, woo, ooh

[Verse 2]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble, sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating, pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

[Chorus]
As we saw, oh, this light
I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls
Every siren is a symphony
Every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall
Is a waterfall, ah
Is a waterfall
Every teardrop is a waterfall, ah

[Bridge]
So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still, I'll raise
Still, I'll raise the flag

[Outro]
It was a waterfall, a waterfall
Oh, every tear, every tear
Oh, every teardrop is a waterfall
Oh, every tear, every tear
Oh, every teardrop is a waterfall
I said, every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

[Intro]
(Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry)
(You don't know how lovely you are)

[Verse 1]
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you to tell you I need you
To tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions
And oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

[Chorus]
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
I'm going back to the start

[Spoken]
Antonio and Martina

[Verse 2]
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
I was pulling the puzzles apart
A question of science, of science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
So tell me you love me, oh, come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

[Chorus]
Nobody said it was easy
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
Oh, let's go back to the start

[Bridge]
Oh ah, ooh
Oh, ooh
Ayy, oh ah, ooh
Oh, ooh
¿Todas están ahí?

[?]
Entonces, si tú quieres cantar conmigo, con nosotros, hoy
Vámonos, listo

[Chorus]
Nobody said it was easy
Oh ho ho, oh, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start

[Outro]
Gracias a todos
Gracias a 

[?], nuestro hermano, for the beginning

[Intro]
Por favor, manos arriba
Uno, dos, tres, go
Dame sus manos
Izquierda, derecha, arriba, abajo
Now gimme a whoo whoo (Whoo whoo)
Whoo whoo (Whoo whoo)
Gimme a whoo whoo (Whoo whoo)
Uno, dos, uno, dos, tres

[Verse 1]
Where do we go? Nobody knows
I've got to say I'm on my way down
God, give me style and give me grace
And put a smile upon my face
Salta conmigo

[Chorus]
Ah, when you work it out, I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out, I wanted to
Ah, when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine, ayy

[Verse 2]
Where do we go to draw the line?
All the girls scream if you're having a good time
Where do we go to fall from grace?
Now all the boys make some noise
Shake the walls of the fucking place

[Chorus]
Ah, when you work it out, I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out, I wanted to
Ah, when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine
Lights off, Feasty

[Outro]
Sing "Olé, olé, olé, olé, olé, olé"
Olé, olé, olé, olé, olé, olé
Sing "Olé, olé, olé, olé, olé, olé"
Olé, olé, olé, olé, olé, olé
Más fuerte, olé, olé, olé, olé, olé, olé
Más fuerte, olé, olé, olé, olé, olé, olé
Vamos cantando juntos, olé, olé, olé, olé, olé
Olé, olé, olé, olé
Uno, dos, uno, dos, tres
One, two, yeah, go!

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ahh, ahh, ooh

[Verse 1]
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
And dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

[Interlude]
Woo, ooh, ooh
Wahh, ahh, ooh

[Verse 2]
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
It flew away from her reach
The bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night, she'll close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly

[Chorus 1]
And dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
She'd dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
La la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la
So lying underneath those stormy skies
She'd say, "Oh, I know the sun must set to rise"

[Chorus 2]
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus 2]
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Post-Chorus]
Para-paradise, para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Pre-Drop]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
In the night, the stormy night, she'll close her eyes

[Drop]
Oh, close her eyes, oh
Close her eyes, oh, close her eyes, oh
Close her eyes, oh, close her eyes, oh
Close her eyes, oh, close her eyes, oh

[Pre-Drop]
Close her eyes, oh, close her eyes, oh
Close her eyes, oh, close her eyes, oh
Close her eyes, oh, close her eyes, oh
Close her eyes, oh, close her eyes, oh

[Drop]
Close her eyes, oh, close her eyes, oh
Close her eyes, oh, close her eyes, oh
Close her eyes, oh, close her eyes, oh
Close her eyes, oh, close her eyes, oh
Close her eyes, oh, eyes, oh, eyes, oh, eyes

[Verse 1]
I think of you
I haven't slept
I think I do, but I don't forget
My body moves, goes where I will
But though I try, my heart stays still
It never moves, just won't be led
And so my mouth waters to be fed

[Chorus]
And you're always in my head
Always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head, ayy
You're always in my head
Oh no, you're always in my
Always in my

[Outro]
This, I guess
Is to tell you you're chosen out from the rest

[Verse 1]
Call it magic, call it true
I call it magic here with all of you
And I just got broken, broken into two
Still, I call it magic when I'm next to you
Eoh-eoh

[Chorus]
And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
And I don't, no I don't, no I don't, no I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

[Verse 2]
Call it magic, cut me into two
And with all your magic, I disappear from view
And I can't get over, can't get over you
Still, I call it magic, you're such a precious jewel

[Chorus]
No, I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
I don't, no I don't, no I don't, no I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

[Bridge]
Wanna fall, fall so far
I wanna fall, fall so hard
And I call it magic, call it true
Call it ma-magic

[Verse 3]
And if you were to ask me
After all that we've been through
"Still believe in magic?"
Well, yes, I do
Of course, I do

[Outro]
Turn the lights on please, Feasty, so we can say hello to everybody
Sending love to Steven, Shirley, Tanner
Nuestro guitarrista, Mr. Jonny Buckland
Nuestro bajista, Mr. Guy Berryman
Nuestro baterista, Mr. Will Champion

[Verse 1]
Oh, they say people come, say people go
These particular diamonds were extra special
And though you might be gone, the world may not know
Still I see you, celestial
And I should, but I can't let you go

[Chorus 1]
But when I’m cold, cold
Yeah, when I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me when I’m in shadow
There's a feeling within me of everglow

[Verse 3]
Like brothers in blood, or sisters who ride
Yeah, we swore on that night, we'd be friends 'til we die
But the changing of winds, and the way waters flow
Life is short as the falling of snow
And now, I'm gonna miss you, I know

[Chorus 2]
But when I'm cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
I know you're always with me and the way you will show
You're with me wherever I go
But you give me this feeling, this everglow

[Bridge]
What I wouldn’t give for just a moment to hold
Because I live for this feeling, this everglow

[Outro]
So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you give me will everglow

[Spoken-Word Outro: Muhammad Ali]
God is watching me
God is, God don’t praise me because I beat Joe Frazier
God don't give nothin’ 'bout Joe Frazier
God don't care nothing about England or America as far as real wealth, it's all His
He wants to know how do we treat each other?
How do we help each other?
So, I’m going to dedicate my life to using my name and popularity to helping charities, helping people, uniting people, bring...
People bombing each other because of religious beliefs
We need somebody in the world to help us all make peace
So when I die, if there's a Heaven, I wanna see it

[Verse 1]
Lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh, and I beg, I beg and plead, singing
Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head
And a trouble that can’t be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing

[Chorus]
You are
You are

[Verse 2]
Confusion that never stops
The closing walls and ticking clocks
Are gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that, but you now know
So I come out upon the seas
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singing

[Chorus]
You are
You are
You, you are
You are

[Bridge]
Oh, nothing else compares
Oh, nothing else compares
Oh, nothing else compares
No, no

[Chorus]
You are
You are

[Outro]
Home, home
Where I wanted to go
Home, home
Where I wanted to go

[Verse]
In the darkness before the dawn
In the darkness before the dawn
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

[Intro: Beyoncé]
Drink from me, drink from me (Oh ah, oh ah)
That we shoot across the sky
Got me feeling drunk and high
Symphony (So high, so high)
That we shoot across the sky

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin, Chris Martin & Beyoncé]
Said drink from me, drink from
When I was so thirsty
Poured on a symphony
Oh, now I just can’t get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
Yo, when I'm low, low, low, low

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Ah, oh ah, oh ah
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh ah, oh ah, oh ah
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Woo

[Verse 2: Chris Martin, Chris Martin & Beyoncé]
Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink and your love’s about
To make the stars come out, yeah

[Verse 2: Chris Martin, Chris Martin & Beyoncé]
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
Yo, when I'm low, low, low, low

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Ah, oh ah, oh ah
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh ah, oh ah, oh ah
I'm feeling drunk and high

[Intro]
Let's go!
Cantar con nosotros, let's go
Oh whoa, oh whoa
Oh whoa, oh whoa

[Verse 1]
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old King is dead, long live the King
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand

[Chorus]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world

[Verse 2]
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
And people couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait for my head on a silver plate
I'm just a puppet on a lonely string
Whoa, for who would ever want to be king?

[Chorus]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world

[Bridge]
Turn the lights off in the stadium
Ahora vamos a cantar juntos
Más fuerte que nunca, go!
Oh whoa, oh whoa
Oh whoa, oh whoa
Oh whoa

[Chorus]
Oh, I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing (Oh whoa)
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing (Oh whoa)
Be my mirror, my sword and shield (Oh whoa)
My missionaries in a foreign field (Oh whoa)
For some reason, I can't explain (Oh whoa)
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world

[Outro]
World, world, world, world, world, world
When I ruled the world, world, world, world
World, world, world, world

[Verse 1]
Turn your magic on
"Umi," she'd say
Everything you want’s a dream away
And we are legends, every day
That's what she told me
Turn your magic on, to me, she'd say
"Everything you want’s a dream away"
Under this pressure, under this weight
Oh, we are diamonds

[Chorus]
And I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
I feel my heart beating
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

[Verse 2]
Said I can't go on, not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
I'm gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me

[Chorus]
And I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
I feel my heart beating
'Cause you make me feel
Like I’m alive again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I’m alive again

Woo, woo

This being human is a guest house
Every morning, a new arrival
A joy, a depression, a meanness
Some momentary awareness comes
As an unexpected visitor
Welcome and entertain them all
Even if they are a crowd of sorrows
Who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture
Still, treat each guest honorably
He may be clearing you out for some new delight
The dark thought, the shame, the malice
Meet them at the door laughing and invite them in
Be grateful for whoever comes
Because each has been sent as a guide from beyond

[Verse 1]
I've been reading books of old, the legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold, Hercules and his gifts
Spider-Man's control, and Batman with his fists
Now clearly, I don't see myself upon that list

[Pre-Chorus]
But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero, some fairy tale bliss
Just something I can turn to, somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

[Bridge]
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

[Chorus]
Oh, I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2]
I've been reading books of old, the legends and the myths
The testaments they told, the moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls a suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero, some fairy tale bliss
Just something I can turn to, somebody I can miss

[Chorus]
I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this

[Bridge]
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

[Pre-Chorus]
Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero, some fairy tale bliss
Just something I can turn to, somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this
I want something just like this
Sing

[Chorus]
Oh, I want something just like this
Something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this

[Verse 1]
'Cause you’re a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I’m gonna give you my heart
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
And 'cause you light up my path
I send this out to my dad and my mom, let's go

[Chorus]
I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don’t care if you do, ooh-ooh, ooh
’Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you

[Verse 2]
’Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I want to die in your arms, oh, oh, oh
’Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark, yes
I'm gonna give you my heart
Come on, come on, come on, come on

[Chorus]
I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, ooh-ooh, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you
I think I saw you

[Outro]
'Cause you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars
Such a heavenly view
You're such a heavenly view
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, ooh
Muchísimas gracias amigos, amigas
Thank you so much everyone

[Verse 1]
Fixing up a car to drive in it again
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up, up and up
Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and up, up and up
I see a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, It's in your blood
Underneath the storm, an umbrella is singing
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up, up and up, it's saying

[Chorus]
We’re gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh, ah
We’re gonna get it, get it together, I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

[Verse 2]
Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up, up and up
Saying, how come people suffer? How come people part?
How come people struggle? How come people break your heart?
Break your heart?
Yes, I wanna know, show me how to feel
Yes, I wanna grow, show me how to heal it up
Heal it up
See the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love, just need love
When the going is rough, say

[Chorus]
We’re gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh, ah
We’re gonna get it, get it together, I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go up

[Bridge]
And you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind or take a risk
You can say it’s mine and clench your fist
Or see each sunrise as a gift

[Chorus]
We’re gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh, ah
We’re gonna get it, get it together, I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go up
We’re gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh, ah
We’re gonna get it, get it together, I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Outro]
Fixing up a car to drive in it again
When you’re in pain, when you think you’ve had enough
Don’t ever give up
Don't ever give up

Our friends, this is the end of A Head Full of Dreams Tour
Back where it all began, Buenos Aires
Thank you, everybody all around the world, at home and abroad
For being the best part of our show, for being the music
And for keeping your and our heads full of dreams
This was our first chapter
From now on, we'll only be full of surprises
We love you, we're grateful for all of you with all of our hearts
We exist for and because of you
Good night, good afternoon, good morning, wherever you are in the world
God bless you all, be kind to each other
We're in this together, we're one big band
Everything is possible if you never give up
And if you believe in love
Believe in, in love

[Verse 1]
Walk up into Barney's and I get what I want
I really hang with niggas richer than Trump, for real
And the flow so cold it'll give you the mumps
You niggas pussy like that time of the month, for real
Rose gold everything, it feel like the Rose Bowl
Niggas, they ain't fuckin' with me, they feel like my old hoes
Got 'em in they feelings 'cause they bitches in a chokehold
I'm like five minutes away from gettin' a boatload
And light my whole city up, Porsche, it go giddy-up
Real nigga, any up, them hoes know I got plenty up
Like Brooklyn, we gon' ante up, used to be a penny up
But now a nigga Fendi'd up, Saint Laurent, Givenchy'd up
The feds just grabbed my young nigga, I know he won't give me up
I look like a drug dealer, I can't put the semi up
My young bitch, she super bad, she love me just like India
My old ops, they super mad, we left them pouring Henny up
'Cause they homies got wacked, we bought Maybachs
Came through they strip, no tint, laid back
Niggas ain't no threats, no cap, they rats
And when they homies got checked, they ain't never get back
Fuck 'em, yeah

[Verse 2]
Let them niggas smoke yo' cousin, you ain't ride yet
RIP on Instagram and you ain't slide yet
They on they corner everyday, shit, they ain't hide yet
I don't wanna hear that gangsta shit if they ain't died yet
Huh, we go to war for that fettuccine
Young niggas turnin' Buicks into Lamborghinis
I took bitches from the projects to Santorini
Got 350 on me now but I ain't wearin' Yeezys
Milli on my wrist, milli on my bitch
20 milli in the bank, really on some shit
I give a fuck what niggas think, they ain't on this tip
I'm on a whole 'nother wave how I'm doin' this shit
Mafia, everything Mafia
Salmon over lobster, we don't even eat tilapia
I done got bougie, more confident and cockier
Since I got some money, hoes suck that dick sloppier
Fuckin' on a bad bitch with a bad bitch on top of her
My young chick said she want a threesome, I got proud of her
She gon' fuck me good and that chick she with gon' follow her
I used to really crush on that lil chick but I got tired of her
How you turn that Grand Prix to a Lambo?
How you turn that mansion to a bando?
I be callin' shots like I'm commando
Get you wet, runnin' round like you was Rambo
Nigga this a new level, new devil
Patek look like it got two bezels, who let you
Run these streets thinkin' you special?
They gon' put a halo on you when them goons catch you
I promise, nigga, and they gon' vomit
Balenciagas
Kickin' this like it's a-
Problem

[Verse 3]
Nigga you can't kill your way to the Clearport
And real nigga credit don't work at the bank
Ain't 'bout no money? What the fuck is you here for?
'Cause bad bitches only respect Benny Frank, uh
I never seen a nigga trap and get a hundred mill
And if he did get it, he ain't got a hundred still
He in the chow line cuttin' back for the double meal
They gave him wild top, went to trial, he said, "fuck a deal"
I want a brand new Bugatti, nigga, fuck appeal
Fuck a Percocet, I'm tryin' pay my mother bills
Leave my son a will, so my son could chill
Take him off the block so the cops don't hunt us still
Uh, I never seen a goon with 20 bodies
Get a new Ferrari and cut the roof up off him
If what I'm spittin' hurt yo' feelings, I am truly sorry
So what I like this, I can only feed you
They tried to bury us, ain't know that we was seeds
We had to trap, ain't get no toys on Christmas Eve
Played that corner made you rich, what we believe
Kill each other, that self hatred a disease, uh
Target on yo' back, target on yo' back
Feds swingin' red beams, target on yo' hat
Just a nigga with a dream, target in the trap
Target on yo' back, target on yo' back
Cappin' on the Gram won't make you successful
And lookin' in them mirrors broke, it could get stressful
And I ain't tryin' to play you 'cause I know you special
But all them Bow Wow challenges, hope they don't catch you
All yo' real homies know you fraud and they let you
Once them bad bitches get a whiff, they won't catch you
Had a lot of fights, down nigga, hustle
'Cause ain't no feelin' when you get it from the muscle
Niggas is trippin' actin' like it ain't a struggle
When they know you got it out the mud and make 'em love you
Never let these niggas trap yo' mind in a bubble
The minute you get locked up, nigga gon' say, "Fuck you"
Then you gon' be super sick, you gon' wanna rumble
Locked up on some stupid shit 

[?] haunt you
You gon' need a lawyer too, you too loud jeezy-

[Verse 4]
Meek Milly, I'm on Flex
Cop, cook and collect
Eating breakfast on a jet
Money, power and respect
Nigga we the shit
New shit drop, talkin' that Championship

[Verse 5]
Niggas dyin' in my hood like it's normal
And sellin' crack won't get you rich, hate to alarm you
I spit facts 'cause I don't wanna misinform you
My job is done, just don't say that I ain't warn you
It ain't no sunshine out the window, we get a rush
From rockin' diamonds in a Benzo, movin' like Lorenzo
For them dead presidents, it was evident we would sin though
Get locked behind a wall, you irrelevant, where your friends go?
Pro'ly at yo' bitch do', she hungry as a hippo
'Cause she gon' fuck yo' dog for some Louis, Gucci or Kenzo
So when you in the cell, reminiscin' how you was lit though
And ballin' with some niggas that wouldn't send you a pic though?
It was loyalty 'til it came to them lawyer fees
And indictments come with football numbers for quarter keys
And the feds seize all of the cribs and auto Vs
And appointed lawyers ain't fightin' for you, they talkin' pleas
Ain't nowhere to turn when that money burn
Was a Balenciaga bandit when you got yo' turn
I see them other guys mistakes and I watch and learn
Dudes that they ride for? Not concerned
For the love of drug money, it was lit
My OG told me that'll get you rich
Handcuffs shine like diamonds on the wrists
Flood the Rollie for this time that we gon' get, yeah
Kings killin' kings, we the KKK
Load up, spray the corner, let that AK spray
Young niggas dyin' in my hood every day
Lock us in the chains, they say we the new slaves
But this ain't a game of ball, we lettin' semis off
Niggas that I went to school with wanna pick me off
I told my dog I'm goin' trap to rap, he said you goin' soft
I just made like 30 mil and the feds just picked him off
They gave him 30 years, I swear I wish he seen the shit I saw
He callin' while I'm on a jet, thinkin' that I missed his calls
On purpose, ain't nobody perfect
And yeah I used to trap too, I knew it wasn't worth it
But I ain't tryin' to judge you, I'm just sayin' make a purchase
Buy a house before you buy a watch and these bitches purses
None of them hoes won't take the time to write in cursive
Send you a letter and spray that paper with some perfume
I knew a nigga that got a Bentley, but they murked him
Them V12's get turned to hearses
Uh, graveyards turn to bedrooms
And ain't no space up in that casket, ain't no legroom
Uh, ain't no love in this shit for real
Everybody goin' to jail or they gettin' killed
Get a life sentence, now you takin' Benadryl
From Phillippe Chow to chow lines just to get your meals

[Verse 6]
Scary nigga
Bloody, bloody, bloody, bloody mary nigga
'Bout to let two famous bitches share me nigga
When it come to that DC, I'm like Wayne Perry nigga

[Hook: Roger Troutman]

Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends

Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way

I’m back under ya cap with Zapp
Droppin’ them bomb-ass raps that hit ya like pimp-slaps
So everybody on the dance-floor, the wallflowers got to go, grab yourself a skirt and flow
‘Cause it’s a grownup party and I’m glad that ya made it
‘California Love,’ ladies gettin’ faded, we got freaks, freaks and more freaks
They got ass for weeks and tweak skirts hugging they buttchecks
I'm on a mission to keep they heads ringin'
And keep your body shakin', plus bring home the bacon
I puff herb like a Jamacian, Hennessy on top
Here to represent and put the West on the map
The land of the locs and the 100 smokes
Put bulletproof vests under my coat 'cause the lead's no joke
Can you feel?
Cali is the place where I chill in '95 until

And it was all yellow

[Chorus]
Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
You know, you know I love you so
You know I love you so

Oh, what a thing to do

Well I must be stupid for feeling so happy
I must be crazy for calling you mine
My life's like a movie but I just let it move me
So slow like a two-step, you hold me real tight

[Chorus]
All my friends say my life’s
Like a bad country song
I just smile, say "I know, but I like to sing along"
For the sweet wedding days
I just put Hank Williams on
I must be stupid for feeling so happy
But they can call me what they want

[Verse 2]
They think I'm crazy but I keep laughing
They think I'm funny for wearing a smile
But it’s just in my nature and it's just how you move me
Real slow like a movie and I wanna rewind

[Chorus]
All my friends say my life's
Like a bad country song
I just smile, say "I know, but I like to sing along"
For the sweet wedding days
I just put Hank Williams on
I must be stupid for feeling so happy
But they can call me what they want

[Outro]
Ah, la, la
Ah, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
I must be stupid for feeling so happy
But they can call me what they want

[Verse 1]
Hey blue baby
Put that Hank Williams on
It's your little blue baby
Callin' for her favorite song
Get out that whiskey
Pour it right quickly
Put them hallway lights on
I hope one day you can remember
Our love before it all went wrong

[Chorus]
But the only stars we saw were in the sky
Not the boulevard
And the only thing we wanted was to be free
And the only girl you had eyes for played downtown
At the local bar
That was me
She was me

[Verse 2]
Hey blue baby
Get that old pickup goin'
Turn it once, twice, three times
If you love me, oh
Get out that dirt bike
Get on that turnpike
Do what you have to do
Just know your baby's back here waiting
Just know she thinks you're really cool

[Chorus - Variation]
And the only stars we saw were in the sky
Not the boulevard
And the only thing we need is to be free
And the only girl you have eyes for plays downtown
At the local bar
That was me
She was me

[Bridge]
I tell you all the time, get yourself in line
Tired of waitin', tired of cryin'
I tell you all the time, get yourself in line
Tired of yellin', tired of hollerin'
You're making me blue, you're making me blue
Making me blue, just do what you do

[Chorus - Variation]
And the only stars we need were in the sky
Not the boulevard
And the only thing we want is to be free
And the only girl that you love still
Plays downtown at the local bar
Yeah she's me
Yeah she's me

[Intro]
Wop, brr
You are the mirror of my—
Wop

[Verse 1]
Rollin' like a mothafucka, high as a kite
Like a hooker in church, I'm sweatin' like a bitch
Lit like a wick, sharp as a tick
Don't slip on the drip, 10K on the kicks
Metro on my beat, Guwop from the East
So play if you want, get shot in the teeth
I cop new time pieces, a million at least
I cop 'em in threes, a million a piece (Well damn)
I'm jumpin' the list for the car that you wish
Deep-dish rims that I bought from the fish
My arm in the pot, I'm cookin' the dish
I'm workin' my move, I'm twistin' my wrist

[Chorus]
I fathered the style, gave you all the wave
But I didn't get nothin' for Father's Day
But I was the one servin' all the J's
I was the one cookin' all the yay
I fathered the style, gave you all the wave
But I didn't get nothin' for Father's Day
But I was the one servin' all the J's
I was the one cookin' all the yay (It's Gucci)

[Verse 2]
Pick your face up, stop droolin'
Haters on my page, not trollin' (Wizzy)
Took the girls out, no golden (Huh)
Call me red carpet, shorty, I'm posin' (Wop)
Nigga knowin' damn well he can't hold me (No)
Plug limit old me, I paid him (Yeah)
Told him, "Thank you" 'cause it was a favor
Thank God 'cause he showed me favor (Lord)
Trap God, now I got all flavors
Won my Vanguard lifetime achievement
I ain't showed the whole world I'm resilient
Hell, all these rappers my children (Yeah)
Brick factory, I breed villains (True)
Told my young niggas it's no ceilin' (Huh)
God willin', run you up a billion (God)
Fuck feelings, run to the millions (Wop)

[Chorus]
I fathered the style, gave you all the wave (Day)
But I didn't get nothin' for Father's Day (Posse)
But I was the one servin' all the J's
I was the one cookin' all the yay
I fathered the style, gave you all the wave (Day)
But I didn't get nothin' for Father's Day (Posse)
But I was the one servin' all the J's
I was the one cookin' all the yay (It's Gucci)

[Chorus]
I could let you have it
You could be my habit
You could be my woman, right
I don't want you havin'
Anytime I know
You're living in a hole
Anytime I know
I could let you have it
You could be my habit
You could be my woman, right
I don't want you havin'
Anytime I know
Living in your head
There's a backdoor

[Verse]
My little one
She is so bad
Bad as the sun
Well she break me then I fall
I don't know the half of it anymore
Yeah well, I could give a fuck about you
She can get whatever she need
Every time that she looked at me
You know I felt weak in my knees
Wanna try to be fancy, love you know
I could give a fuck about you
You know that I do my girl
Feel it when you're coming close
You always hit on the nose but
Never know how you could know but
Treat me like one
Treat me treat me like a
I don't know the half
Why would you w-want her (Why?)
Treat me like the queen
Slap your knees
Like you been laughing

[Chorus]
I could let you have it
You could be my habit
You could be my woman, right
I don't want you havin'
Anytime I know
You're living in a hole
Anytime I know
I could let you have it
You could be my habit
You could be my woman, right
I don't want you havin'
Anytime I know
Living in your head
There's a backdoor

[Outro]
I could be yours if you wanted
I could be yours if you wanted
Please, please tell me

[Verse 1]
I like when you mess your hair up
Smile every time you wake up
Tonight we don't need to dress up
And I think you know that
We come from different places
Love has so many faces
So let the whole world chase us
And I think you know that

[Pre-Chorus]
We can go all night
Just me and you, that's all we do
Let's just stay inside and explore the room
Even if we fight
There's always making up to do
We can go all night, my love

[Chorus]
As long as I'm with you
As long as I'm with you

[Verse 2]
I tell you you're beautiful 'cause
I want you to feel secure
Nothing will ever change this
I need you to know that
We come from different places
Love has so many faces
So let the whole world chase us
And I think you know that

[Pre-Chorus]
We can go all night
Just me and you, that's all we do
Let's just stay inside and explore the room
Even if we fight
There's always making up to do
We can go all night, my love

[Chorus]
As long as I'm with you
As long as I'm with you
As long as I'm with you
As long as I'm with you

We can go all night
Just me and you, that's all we do
Let's just stay inside and explore the room
Even if we fight
There's always making up to do
We can go all night, my love
As long as I'm with you

[Bridge]
Like when you mess your hair up
Smile every time you wake up
Tonight we don't need to dress up
And I think you know that

[Pre-Chorus]
We can go all night
Just me and you, that's all we do
Let's just stay inside and explore the room
Even if we fight
There's always making up to do
We can go all night, my love

[Chorus]
As long as I'm with you
As long as I'm with you
As long as I'm with you
As long as I'm with you

Long as I'm with you, baby
Long as I'm with you
Long as I'm with you, baby
Long as I'm with you, baby
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]

[?]
Swim with me in the Ocean
Bring you there on the Island, oh
I'mma hit him with the lefts and the rights, than I'm turnin' off the lights and the son better pray about it
All my niggas on the way, they know what you did 

[?]
Why you acting like a bitch in the face, like a kid what you eight years old in a man body 

[?]
Had to hit him with the grits and pan I Madea'd him

[?] Comming on strong, East strong, turnin' right that wrong no water, lemme find a swamp throw you back into the water, monster

[Verse 1]
I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday, I'm in love
Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday, I'm in love

[Chorus]
Saturday, wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday, never hesitate

[Verse 2]
I don't care if Monday's black
Tuesday, Wednesday heart attack
Oh, Thursday never looking back
It's Friday, I'm in love

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Monday you can hold your head
Tuesday, Wednesday stay in bed
Or Thursday watch the walls instead
It's Friday, I'm in love

[Chorus]
Saturday, wait
And Sunday always comes too late
Friday, never hesitate

[Bridge]
Dressed up to the eyes
It's such a wonderful surprise
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throwing out your frown
Smile at the sound
As sleek as a shriek spinning round and round
Always take a big bite
Such a gorgeous sight
To see you eat in the middle of the night
You can never get enough
Enough of this stuff
It's Friday I'm in love

[Verse 4]
I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday, I'm in love
Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday, I'm in love

[Verse 1: Toro y Moi & (Anthony Ferraro)]
Who are your new friends?
Why did you bring them?
But who am I? (Who am I?)

I took my time
Now I'm stuck in line
To see you
"Hey! how've you been?"

[Chorus: Toro y Moi]
Oooo, yeah right...
Oooo, yeah right...

[Verse 2: Toro y Moi & (Anthony Ferraro)]
Let's hang out soon, I'll give you a call
I'll be around (I'll be around), I think I'll go now
What do you mean?
Stay for a while
Oh, let's go get high

[Chorus: Toro y Moi]
Oooo, yeah right...
Oooo, yeah right...

[Refrain: Toro y Moi]
Never can say goodbye, girl (ohh, no, no, ohh)
Never can say goodbye, girl (ohh, no, no, ooh)

[Guitar Solo: Toro y Moi]

[Chorus: Toro y Moi]
Yeah right...
Yeah right...

[Outro: Toro y Moi]
Thank you so much everybody, b-bye

[Verse 1]
Let's awaken and turn on our minds
No one is waiting for you in this line
So carry yourself on up, With no reason for delay
Before you didn't even care to ask
About the present or impending plans
I'm off for the day
It's whatever you wanna do

[Hook]
I can get you what you want
It's good to see you keep in touch

[Verse 2]
It doesn't bother me anymore
I know it seems as if you were ignored
But know that you weren't so tell me again
Bear with me, I'm not good at keeping up

[Verse 3]
Moving on, no more opinions now
The time is coming where we all dip out
So I'll follow you, or you follow me
Does anyone know where we go from here?

[Outro: Toro y Moi]
Crowd cheers
Thank you
Alright
The sound, sounds okay?
K, this next song is called Buffalo

[Verse 1]
Looking for the one to blame is tough
Doesn't matter what you’re talking about
She's gonna keep calling your bluff
We're not the only ones doing this

You see the buffalo, just another one in the road
We laugh about it in his face fall between the rock and the other place
I know how this goes, it’s always gonna be the boy who gives
There's always gonna be the girl to please
Did you get out everything? I'll see

[Refrain]
Cause you love it all
Cause you'll find a way to keep on

[Verse 2]
He doesn't seem to get the joke
He's turning yellow, as the yolk
Someone take away his microphone
Pushed him off the stage 'till he's on his own
Can’t feel a thing when he takes a shot
Ends up taking three right to the eyes
Cash in when the time is right
Can’t stop by if he ever stops
Get down from there or fall
Don't make us wait, too long

[Refrain]
Cause you love it all
Cause you’ll find a way to keep on
(Hold it on, cause you'll find a way to keep on)
Cause you love it all
Cause you'll find a way
Cause you love it all
Cause you'll find a way to keep on

[Outro: Toro y Moi]
Thank you

[Verse 1: Toro y Moi]
I let you fall asleep on the floor
Nothing's on so I'll just ignore
Don't bother to wake me up
You said nothing's worse than leaving a dream

No one gets me more than you
What is it you want to do?
Let's go outside to the green

[Hook: Toro y Moi & (Anthony Ferraro)]
We've got all we want
There's no place to go
There's only one (there's only one)
Something's wrong (something's wrong)

[Verse 2: Toro y Moi]
I'd only go if we got in for free
Counted the rows, I hope you're right by me
You shut your eyes while I look at the sky
Then you ask, "How long was the flight?"

[Hook: Toro y Moi & (Anthony Ferraro)]
We've got all we want
There's no place to go
There's only one (there's only one)
Something's wrong (something's wrong)
We've got all we want
There's no place to go
There's only one! (only one)
Oh, something's wrong! (something's wrong)

[Outro: Toro y Moi]
Thank you
This is our last song everyone
So uh, it's a slow burner, so here we go

[Verse]
Understand the purpose of making
Everything around you better
There are no zeroes after this one
There is no one to destroy your sweater

[Chorus]
I'll try to hum it to you if I can't sing
My baby wants me back before I even leave
Smothered and covered by my high school dreams
Call Mom and Daddy cause the nest is empty
And so are you
And so are you

[Refrain]
Meet with your advisor?
Do you still draw in the margins?
Bubble letters reading "WHAT FOR?"
And "I wish I had a stand-in..."

[Chorus 2]
Let's try to make another hit for the teens
I miss your bangs, can you cut them for me?
Smothered and covered by my high school dreams
Call Mom and Daddy cause the nest is empty
And so are you
And so are you

[Outro: Toro y Moi & Crowd]
Thank you
Cheers
I wanna introduce my band:
This is Andy on the drums
Got you got Patrick on the bass
Yo got JoJo on guitar, Jodran
And we got Anthony on keys
Cheers
Thanks for watching

[Verse 1]
The day that I met you I started dreaming
Now I write 'em down if I remember in the morning time
I don't know that much about Kingston
But I like the sound it makes when it starts pouring rain
I think that tonight I'll leave my light on
'Cause I get lonely when it's out and I miss you right about now

[Chorus]
Baby tell me where you want to go
Baby tell me what you want to know
Give you everything I have and more

[Verse 2]
He said baby, that's what he called me, I love you
Every single word you say makes me feel some type of way
It's the thought of you that slightly scares me
But it takes my breath away, forget what I was gonna say
The day that I met you I started dreaming
Now I write 'em down if I remember in the morning time

[Chorus]
Baby tell me where you want to go
Baby tell me what you want to know
Give you everything I have and more
Baby tell me where you want to go
Baby tell me what you want to know
Give you everything I have and more
Baby tell me where you want to go
Baby tell me what you want to know
Give you everything I have and more

[Intro]
Yeah, slatt

I put it right on top of her tongue, yeah
And she said it was so yummy, yeah
It was so yummy, I put it on my jammies till I started coming
Till she started cumming, then I started cumming inside of her tummy
She said that she's ready to become a mommy
You know one thing ’bout it, that motherfucker gon' have no book like a comic
You know one thing about it, when I'm on that Molly I fuck out your lungs

[Chorus: Young Thug]
It's your birthday, you can cry if you want to

Your birthday, you can cry if you want to

[Chorus]
She's cheekbones and shade
But she brightens up my days
She's cheekbones and shade
But she brightens up my days

[Verse 1]
I'll never forget her, no
She was one of the first to ever love me
And I can't replace all the memories that I have of her
And though they are fleeting beats though
For they never lie further than the stars

[Chorus]
She's cheekbones and shade
But she brightens up my days
She's cheekbones and shade
But she brightens up my days

[Chorus]
She's cheekbones and shade
But she brightens up my days
She's cheekbones and shade
But she brightens up my days
She's cheekbones and shade
But she brightens up my days
She's cheekbones and shade
But she brightens up my days

[Verse 2]
And sometimes she smiles
But not that often

Ohhhh (x9)
She's cheekbones and shade

[Intro: Toro y Moi]
It's always the same as always
It's a game that we play
No one's safe

[Chorus: Toro y Moi]
Maximize all the pleasure
Even with all this weather
Nothing can make it better
Maximize all the pleasure
Maximize all the pleasure
Even with all this weather
Nothing can make it better
Maximize all the pleasure

[Verse 1: Toro y Moi]
Does sex even sell anymore?
I feel like I've seen it all
Or maybe I'm just old
Or maybe old

[Chorus: Toro y Moi]
Maximize all the pleasure
Even with all this weather
Nothing can make it better
Maximize all the pleasure
Maximize all the pleasure
Even with all this weather
Nothing can make it better
Maximize all the pleasure

[Verse 2: Toro y Moi]
'Cause this world makes a lot of noise for me
Makes it hard for me to hear what I'm thinking
So it's fine if you gotta get away
So it's fine if you gotta get away

[Chorus: Toro y Moi]
Maximize all the pleasure
Even with all this weather
Nothing can make it better
Maximize all the pleasure
Maximize all the pleasure
Even with all this weather
Nothing can really make it better oh no

[Outro: Anthony Ferraro]
Ooh, ah ah
Ooh, ooh ooh, ah
Ooh, ooh ooh, ah

[Verse 1]
He used to call me DN
That stood for Deadly Nightshade
'Cause I was filled with poison
But blessed with beauty and rage
Jim told me that, he hit me and it felt like a kiss
Jim brought me back, reminded me of when we were kids

[Chorus]
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence

[Verse 2]
He used to call me poison
Like I was poison ivy
I could have died right there
'Cause he was right beside me
Jim raised me up, he hurt me but it felt like true love
Jim taught me that, loving him was never enough

[Chorus]
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence
Hello my dear
How have you been?
It's been awhile
Since I could talk
Since I've said much
My mouth's shut closed
My heart is stone
Family comes first
Sometimes it hurts
Sometimes it hurts


Hello good friend
Where have you been
Don't push me away
I'll never leave
I'll always be
Alone
Alone
Ohhh, Alone
Alone
Alone
Meet my cat
Meet my dog
Look so tough
Feels so strong

Hold me tight, pretty lady
String your body
From the walls
Throw all your coins in the wishing well
You were the sweetest one that I ever saw

Meet my cat
Meet my dog
We've been waiting
For so long

What's my number, baby
What's my number, baby
What's my number, baby
What's my number, baby
I'll be here
Until the autumn
I'll make your bed
And sweep the floor
I'll keep the number
Always hidden
In the attic
Underneath the floorboards

[Verse]
I can see your shadow
Underneath the moon
Maybe a winter cloudburst
Heading this way soon
Heading this way soon

[Chorus]
In the blink of an eye
Many songs have been sung
Many lives have gone by
We will never give up
We will hold on to love
With no reason to cry

[Chorus]
In the blink of an eye
Many songs have been sung
Many lives have gone by
We will never give up
We will hold on to love
With no reason to cry

[Verse]
I can see your shadow
Underneath the moon
Maybe a winter cloudburst
Heading this way soon
Heading this way soon

[Jason Bentley & Toro y Moi]
Alright next up we take you to our performance studio, a live set. Toro y Moi: Has been an enduring favorite on KCRW over the years, joining us at the start of a headlining tour in support of his last album "Boo Boo" released in 2017 as well as a new album just anounced for release this coming January, "Outer Peace." It is a pleasure to welcome back Toro y Moi
Hello

[Intro: Toro y Moi]
Ahhhhhh
Ahhhhhh
Ahhhhhh
Ahhhhhh
Ahhhhhh

[Verse: Toro y Moi]
Take me far away
Cuz I know my words can be a waste of breath
Space is running low
She thinks I'm guilty of this crime
But I don't think I'll wait to tomorrow
Tomorrow's so far
It seems like a flaw in design
I seek you out and you never seem to have the time
Mirage, so careful now
Too close, you're finding out
Is it me being blind?
Notice that I'm high as a kite
And now I'm pacing too fast to speak
It's me, so fine
I was only looking to be with you now
So take it or leave it, take it or treat it
So high
I dunno why I do this to myself
So high, so high, so high
So high

[Outro: Toro y Moi]
"Oh hello, I didn't see you there" -Chaz

[Chorus]
Been a while since I been home
It took a second 'cause my baby don't know—I
Been so hesitant, I'm such a no show—why?
My baby got fed up with my ego

Oh—wasn't even thinkin' we were going worldwide
Figured it was better than the southern life

[Verse 1]
What if I ask you 'Why?'
If you can realize
You say I never fight
Why do you want me to?

[Verse 2]
But you went and did it wrong anyway
I haven't seen your face in a while
I know you didn't wanna have me around
But why you gotta take so long?

[Verse 3]
Headed back to the Bay
People say it's crazy now
Honestly it feels the same
I need to touch the ground
I need to hit the Town
No need to plan a ride when we get down

[Chorus]
It's been a while since I've been home
It took a second 'cause my baby don't know—I
Been so hesitant, I'm such a no show—why?
My baby got fed up with my ego, oh
Oh—wasn't even wishin' to be known worldwide
Figured it was better than the southern life

[Verse 1]
Oh, walk on the water -ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah- for me
Just for me baby, OK
Oh, there's always gon' be pressure -ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah- OK
Pressure

[Verse 2]
Nothing's ever worse than work unnoticed
Freelance now, yeah I guess you earned it
Life is only wishing we could load it
Level up, you've got to make a bonus

Mystic staring at his phone for oneness
Silver or black mirror, what's the difference?
Imitation always gets a bad rep, man
Witches Brew had me on the first sip, man

[Verse 3]
Smells like autumn, smells like leaves
You don't know that you're rust and not belong so much
And then you get left alone
Left alone
Cloud hidden and my whereabouts unknown
Cazadero got me wearing all camo
Decked in Patagonia, head to toe
Down for whatever, I think I let go

No more shoes and socks, I only rock sandals
I can't hear you, maybe you could change your tone
I can't tell if I'm hip or getting old
People tend to listen when they see your soul

[Verse 4]
Oh, walk on the water -ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah- for me
Just for me baby, OK

Sometimes I think we are from the same place
Now I don't
What just happened, happened, happened, happened, happened, happened?

[Verse 1]
You really wanna be with her
You wanted someone who was different
You run across the city with her
You end up in a labyrinth

[Verse 2]
Again, I kept you up too late
You lay down in bed and say
"I don't even know but I've got to go"

This apocalypse is never ending
Starting a second life and keep moving

A shake in your voice is all I hear when you tell me you can't decide
Who's gonna wipe away those tears if you come out alive?
You say there's a missing piece
Are you searching for both of us?
Did you want me to kiss and leave?
I can do this without a shove

[Verse 1]
For some one who understands
You sure doin' a job
You're like Prometheus and Bob
You are your own boss

[Hook]
The laws of your universe
Decide who goes first

[Verse 2]
James Murphy is spinning at my house
All red from Flying Dutchman
Opinions outweigh my doubts
Or maybe, i just pay attention
I said, opinions outweigh my doubts
Or maybe, i just pay attention
I don't give a

[Intro: Toro y Moi]
Alright, we're gonna play a new song

[Hook: Toro y Moi]
I want a brand new house
Something I can not buy, something I can afford (oooh, oh)
I want a brand new house
Something I can not buy, something I can afford (oooh)
I want a brand new house
Something I can not buy, something I can afford
I want a brand new house
Something I can not buy, something I can afford

[Verse 1: Toro y Moi]
I ain't even make of the jet wait now
Phones been on blast like all day (ooh)
Why you gotta do this? try to test me now
Right when I touchdown got anxiety
Follow signs out of the terminal now
JFK is a different animal now
Baggage claim is like a warzone now
Glad I packed light clothes, I'm on my own

[Hook: Toro y Moi]
I want a brand new house (brand new)
Something I can not buy, something I can afford
I want a brand new house (brand new)
Something I can not buy, something I can afford
I want a brand new house (brand new)
Something I can not buy, something I can afford
I want a brand new house (brand new)
Something I can not buy, something I can afford

[Verse 2: Toro y Moi]
I just want a long shower
I been feeling so crowded
My bad I think I think I saw your text
My bad here's my new address (oh)
Stay for me, stay for me

Is there a reason
Oooh (mm, mm, mm)
Oooh

[Chorus]
But what's it gonna take for a guy like me to find a girl like you?
What I gotta do to find a girl whose loving is more than true?
No one can play the game alone, even if you try to
Baby, I’m yours now
Dreaming a connection
I can meet you downtown
I'll take you where you wanna be tonight

[Verse]
Too much looking around
I can see how this happens
Using up all the lifelines
Tryna turn out decent
You've got plenty of time
I can see you walked over
What you see isn’t in my mind
Don't believe we've met before
I'm acting, playing quiet, smiling, without thought
'Cause my world's been turned inside out
Been gone quite a while

[Chorus]
But what's it gonna take for a guy like me to find a girl like you?
What I gotta do to find a girl whose loving is more than true?
No one can play the game alone, even if you try to
Baby, I'm yours now
Dreaming a connection
I can meet you downtown
I’ll take you where you wanna be tonight

[Bridge]
Aren’t you gonna stay?
Keep me 'til the sun comes up
Crack a Pellegrino
From the bottle, no cup
That was summer love, that was summer love
Late night, cemetery
Think it’s still light out
Temporary love at sight now
Love is scary, baby, look out

[Chorus]
But what's it gonna take for a guy like me to find a girl like you?
What I gotta do to find a girl whose loving is more than true?
No one can play the game alone, even if you try to
Baby, I'm yours now
Dreaming a connection
I can meet you downtown
I'll take you where you wanna be tonight

[Outro: Toro y Moi and Jason]

[Verse]
Enjoy your time alone
The older you get the harder it is to find
Feet are worn down to the bone
I call you up to tell you what's on my mind

[Chorus]
6 7 2 hours from now
I'll find a way somewhere somehow
What is it to you?
What's in it for me?
I've earned the right to be selfish
Don't you agree?
Climbing up the hill
Dont know what I'll see
Something tells me
You miss me
6 7 2 hours from now
I'll find a way somewhere somehow

[Interlude]
I'm at loss for words
Waiting
Waiting
Waiting
Waiting
Just dont believe everything you've heard

[Chorus]
6 7 2 hours from now
I'll find a way somewhere somehow
What is it to you?
What's in it for me?
I've earned the right to be selfish
Don't you agree?
Climbing up the hill
Dont know what I'll see
Something tells me
You miss me
6 7 2 hours from now
I'll find a way somewhere somehow

[Verse 1]
Lightning strikes only once in your life
I guess I'm lucky 'cause I've found myself
In the line of fire tonight
My heart beats like thunder under my skin
And my world speaks in wonder since you appeared
Now we are here

[Chorus]
And I could die in your arms tonight
But it would be a shame
'Cause I want to live a thousand lives
And be your immortal flame

[Verse 2]
Dreams hardly ever do come true
I guess I'm lucky 'cause I've found myself
Waking up right next to you
Oh, and with this raging heart of mine
I'll love you till the end of time
I thank the gods that our stars align
From the ocean floor to the distant sun
Forever more to kingdom come
Have no fear, I'll be burning here

[Chorus]
And I could die (I could die)
In your arms tonight
But it would be a shame (A shame)
'Cause I want to live a thousand lives
And be your immortal flame (Your immortal)
I'll be your (Your immortal)
Ooh, I'll be your (Your immortal)
Oh, I'll be your (Your immortal flame)

[Bridge]
And I could die in your arms tonight
But it would be a shame
'Cause I want to live a thousand lives
And be your immortal flame

[Outro]
Love you again and again
An everlasting fantasy
I'll be your immortal

[Chorus]
I wanna fly right now
I wanna see all my homies get down
I wanna feel like I can't come down
I got a dream so I can’t stop now
I wanna, I wanna fly right now
I wanna see all my homies get down
I wanna feel like I can't come down
I got a dream so I can't stop now
I gotta stop feeling invisible and start feeling invincible
Hate, feeling impossible
The hardest thing is believing in your dreams
Stop feeling invisible and start feeling invincible
Hate, feeling impossible
The hardest thing is believing in your dreams

[Post-Chorus]
I feel like a stranger to myself
And sometimes that feels dangerous but I’ll bet you'll see me
For who I truly am, maybe not if it wasn't bland
Some days I look in mirrors and I wonder who's that man
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah

[Verse]
All my people gather 'round, I'm here to inspire (True)
If you runnin' on E, I'll put the fire in your lighter (Yeah)
Black Hollywood never started and it’s over
People only care when you’re Denzel or Oprah (Yeah)
Kosher, holster, make my homies bolder (Woo)
When your fear's near, you don’t wanna get closer (No)
Rappers sound the same so they chains gettin' colder (Yeah)
Women, claim your boy for some credit and some doja (Hey)
Hold up, that's just how we make it (Yeah)
Black never breaks so your patience gotta face it (Damn)
Know my life matter, but my matter keep on achin' (True)
This a warning, never conforming (No)

[Chorus]
I wanna fly right now
I wanna see all my homies get down
I wanna feel like I can’t come down
I got a dream so I can't stop now
I wanna, I wanna fly right now
I wanna see all my homies get down
I wanna feel like I can't come down
I got a dream so I can't stop now
I gotta stop feeling invisible and start feeling invincible
Hate, feeling impossible
The hardest thing is believing in your dreams
Stop feeling invisible and start feeling invincible
Hate, feeling impossible
The hardest feeling is believing in your dreams

[Outro]
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah

[Verse 1]
If my ragged home, becomes bricks and stones
I hope you'd help me fix it
And if my wounded soul becomes cold and low, I know I can predict it

[Chorus]
We all ?
Of what we're given to
Who grow up right
At best it seems ? end up chokin' what we got left
Ahhh ahhh

[Verse 2]
I keep those lessons learned
And make my mind sometime
For ? behind me

So tell my ? if I become too ill to watch for those behind us
I know it's wrong for me to tell you what is right if I'm so unworthy

Mama save us, keep that ? close
I don't wanna go too far

[Chorus 2]
We are ?
What we're given to grow up right
At best it seems ? end up chokin' what we got left

[Verse 1]
This weight on my shoulders
I'm watching you pack up
And throw in your t shirt
Decide which ones you like
I’ll help you with that then
I know your hands are full
Behind you is empty
Darling can you hear me?

Hey
Hey

[Verse 2]
Anochors pulling on my legs and arms
If I lift up anymore I'll break my bones
It's a 

[?] pulling me
If I breath I can’t reach you
It's a 

[?] pulling me
If I breath

[Verse 3]
Im a goner yes I know
You're my savior yes I know 

[?]
Its sad when I get too silent when I know I should speak up

[Interlude]
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 4]
Can make it there
Are you tired babe let me know
Am I in the way
Are you losing time
Am I botherin you let me know
'Cause I gotta work
And I'm tired too
But I dont wanna let you go
Come on babe give me one more kiss
I know we can pull some rope
Come on babe I know you understand
But you know I'll be back for you
I just can't seem to ....
I woke alone
Slowly I rose from my sleep
Outside my window there was no sun for me

Labor in vain
I lift my head to breathe
Hoping to see the end, desperately grasping dreams

I lay me down
Buried beside my love
Oh can it be here below same as it is above
Forces enter you like breath
The sting, the offspring of death herself
I hear my babies cry all through the night
Stricken by haunting dreams

Nightly they return to haunt
Someday I fear they will not
Then I will know my end, know my rest
Then I will know the true darkness
Like a thorough bread horse arching its neck in dying light
Letting its mane grow long and flow into the night
Time is still but deep and runs its current through my heart
The lazy river flows to oceans in the dark

Through my window blinds the sunlight seems to slowly fall
As my candle burns I see my shadow dancing on the wall
Though I know not where to go I’ll follow so close behind
Give it one more try as I weave myself into another life

In a thronging cavalry, filled with passion and forget
Writing twisted dreams held firm until the end
Unsurpassed in beauty she holy Helen came and went
Only thoughts of loveless passion did she spend

Now I go with her and sacrifice my only child
In perverted paraphrase I worship shadows in the night
Though I know not where to go I’ll follow so close behind
Walk into the light as I weave myself into another life
Thought I heard some voices call, but it was just the wind a-windin’
Thought I heard some footsteps fall, but it was just the gravel grindin’

When I sit here all alone
Let my weary mind roam
And slowly close my eyes
I can make believe you're mine

Thought I heard my favorite song but it what just the chimes a-chimin’
Then I tried to sing along but the wind had stopped its windin’

Gotta try to convince myself
I can really be someone else
And my life will all workout
And my blues won’t haunt me down

Thought I saw my shadow leave me
Then I found the sun deceive me
As it passed right by me on its way

Though I know it’s not forever
Nothing I can’t keep together
But my words and those I’ll never say
Thought I heard you say my name but it was just my mind a-wanderin’
Thought I saw you walk my way but it was just that memory hauntin’
Time piece antithesis of my memories
Wandering you are the light that I’m following

The weary voices in the dark are calling out and I begin to walk
And every star is shining down on me alone, on me and no one else

Lord, let me walk in your garden
Lay me, lay me down on the roses
Keep me in your right hand
Keep me in your right hand

The hollow place from where I come
Some memory that I must soon forget
The heart’s a hallway vast and hushed
And far away I hear your subtle steps
Let me be the one
If you're feeling lonely I can make you feel at home
No one else around you, I’ll surround you with my love
Hold you close and keep you in a place where you belong
Oh, if you let me be the one

Let me see you cry
Don't be scared, I know it's hard but let me see you try
Though it’s all the same don't be ashamed to be in love
I've not gone far but I know that no one should feel along
Oh, won't you let me be the one
Waking up in the morning
Sun beneath horizon’s waiting
To fill my windows full of light
I like the place I’m living
Trees along the streets I’m walking
And a warm place where I lie

But I don’t mind changing
No I don’t mind changing

There was a song you were singing
Something about a fool walking
Across a lake covered up in ice
Trying to make it to a lover
But falling under
And leaving nothing but life behind

One of us is changing
One of us is changing

Between two ivory towers
Runs a river flowing faster
With every cycle of the moon
When I feel that current
Lift me up from where I’m standing
Will it carry me back to you?
Well my world is changing
Yeah my world is changing
Yeah my world is changing
Yeah my world is changing
Can’t shake the feeling that I’m on my way
Losing control and falling faster everyday
Feels like life’s just a speeding train
Don’t know where I’m going to, but I know it’s far away

There it is
Can’t change my world
But I can live in it or die trying
And here we are
These days just fall in line like strings of white diamonds

Just make the call babe and I’ll meet you there
Don’t mind the distance I’ll go with you anywhere
Choose the place and I’ll choose the time
I’d risk it all to chase this feeling every night

[Intro]
I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me

[Verse 1]
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer had gone

[Chorus]
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think my little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me

[Verse 2]
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
And it's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, oh it's nice to believe

[Chorus]
Then when you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me
Won't you think of me?
I hope you think of me

[Bridge]
And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
There's a letter on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:
"When you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place"

[Chorus]
When you think happiness
Hope you think my little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think of me
I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me
Oh won't you think of me?
I hope you think of me
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me
You think of me

[Outro]
He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"

[Intro: Pitbull]
They tried to get rid of me
But from ocean to ocean
They gon' have to deal with me

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I been overlooked, slept on
Stepped on, left for dead
Always against all odds like Pac said
I'm the living Great Gatsby
But these boys are watching quick and disappear like Banksy
From ocean to ocean, sea to sea
I'm something that you gotta see

[Chorus: Rhea]
Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I practice what I preach, but I ain't gon' lie
I still got love for these streets, 305 'til I die
Still got love for these beats, that's why I spit this fire
You can catch me on a beach, 'specially on the islands
Took over my city, now it's time for the world
I live it, they rap it, there's a difference, girl
Getting paid more than athletes, man, life is sweet
GM on the status, Papo, watch me, (Woo)

[Chorus: Rhea]
Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (Woo)

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
I got the world on my shoulder, still quick on my feet
Nas say sleep is the cousin of death so I don't sleep
These boys act like they hard but we know that they sweet
They wouldn't bust a grape at a food fight, Papo, please
Went from rapping with them boys with a mouth full of gold
To hanging with Slim Jr., down in Mexico
Take it with a grain of salt, and a, pound of gold
The game is to be sold, and not told, let's go

[Chorus: Rhea]
Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

[Kendrick Lamar]
And everybody know the story of David and Goliath
But this is bigger than triumph
This is for the warrior, this is for you and I
This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
God is recording this, won't you look in the sky?
Tell him that you got the behavior of your neighbor
Even when stability's never in your favor
Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
Walk through the valley and peaks, with bare feet
Run through the flames, that's more passion for me
I passed testimony just so the world can see
My battle wounds on me, you watching me lick ‘em clean
I know, I know, my pride, my goals, my highs, my lows
I know, I know, it's mind control
I know I could prosper, no impostor, prosecute my posture
I stand up and I stand by ya, what?

[Alicia Keys]
I am a freedom fighter, the name that history wrote
And even through disaster, eye of the tiger for hope
I'm trying to find my way back, there's no day off for heroes
And even when I'm tired, go is the only word I know
And the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on

[I bet they wonder how I go on, go on]

[I bet they wonder how I go on, go on]
I'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh
I am a lonely hero, trying to fight my battles
Life likes to blow the cold wind, sometimes it freezes my shadow
In the midst of all this darkness, I sacrifice my ego
There ain't no room for selfish, we do it for the people
And the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken

[When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward]
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on

[I bet they wonder how I go on, go on ]
I'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh
Say the work don't stop, cause they don't stop
And everybody here tryna get on top
Everybody from the burbs down to the block
Gotta hold on tight and don't let go, let go
Huh, so you think you hot?
Gotta grind hard, give it all you got
You can have, or you can have not
You see that a lot in the ghetto, ghetto
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh
You all heard the story of whippin’ that old TB
Plunkin’ and a singin’ whipping that old TB
We’ll I’m hear to tell yah the TB is whipping me

Once I had a mama thought the world of me
Lord I once had a mama that thought the world of me
But her love vanished when I took this old TB

I went to see the doctor and he thumped upon my back
Went to see the doctor and he thumped upon my back
He say’s boy you’re travelin’ on a one way track

(Tell me the truth doctor)

I went on down the street, found a fortune tellin’ man
I strolled on down the street, found a fortune tellin’ man
I say’s boy I know my past, tell me my future if you can

(Tell it to me brother)

My lungs are rattlin’ and you ought to hear this cough of mine
Lord my lungs are rattlin’ and you ought to hear this cough of mine
That dog's gone bug from working overtime
Listen hear pretty mama I know I can’t last long
Lord I know good mama that I can’t last long
You're gonna be sorry after I am gone

(Your gonna miss me honey)
Rain or shine, alright
Come with me tonight
Come on, let's all go bad

Black or white, who cares
I got you in my nightmares
Come on, let's all go bad

Let's get excited in a new way
Let's get excited in a new way, hey
Let's get excited in a new way
Let's get excited in a new way, hey

Right or wrong, tonight
I got you in my eyesight
Come on, let's all go bad

Let's get excited in a new way
Let's get excited in a new way, hey
Let's get excited in a new way
Let's get excited in a new way, hey
Girl, I think we're getting old
My heart's grown colder
And your hair's turning gray

Come on, what do you say
Let's put the horse behind the cart
And make some hay

Old maid
We're not getting any younger
So wait
You can count your chickens
When you get laid
Old maid

Now I know you two were the best of friends
And you're about the only one she ever let in
But she's dead and that's a fact
And what I'm getting at?
I think we can do better than that
Old maid
We're not getting any younger
So wait
You can count your chickens
When you get laid

Now I know we've been friends since
Oh I can't remember way back when
Never in the month of May
June August or September
Well how about today?

Old maid
We're not getting any younger
Old maid
You can count your chickens
When you get laid

[Intro]
Yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, love

[Verse 1]
I was standing on a mountaintop
The sunshine smiling on my face
Breeze was taking me away
It was the perfect day, and everything changed
And I lost my father suddenly
Couldn't keep it together, my family
And all my reckless ways caught up with me
Like the tortoise and the hare
I was sleepin' when I shouldn't be

[Pre-Chorus]
I come back to you, come back
I come back to you
I come back to you, come back
I come back to you

[Chorus]
I testify, I pledge allegiance to you
This love inside, it makes me come back to you
I testify, I pledge allegiance to you
Live or die, I always come back to you

[Verse 2]
I lost my job and it haunted me
Me and my lady lost a pregnancy
And at my lowest, it dawned on me
I'd forgotten who I'm supposed to be

[Chorus]
I testify, I pledge allegiance to you
This love inside, it makes me come back to you
I testify, I pledge allegiance to you
Live or die, I always come back to you

[Bridge]
Broken free from the chains that binded me
Like an angel with brand new wings
I can be anything I wanna be
I can love myself again

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I come back to you
I come back to you
I come back to you, come back
I come back to you

[Chorus]
I testify, I pledge allegiance to you
This love inside, it makes me come back to you
I testify, I pledge allegiance to you
Live or die, I always come back to you
I don't wanna be alone
But it's so nice to be alone
'Cause you will be there
With bugs in your hair

And we will sit and fall to find
Transparencies in made up time
And I'll take fresh notes
On how and why the
Concrete floats

These devils creep
Up to me
And they ask me why I'm so sad
That they feel bad for me
But they want my money

[Verse 1: Elton John]
So you're just thinking of me
Just like I know you should
I can not give you everything, you know I wish I could
I’m so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
We still got love to give

[Chorus: Elton John]
While we’re young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb, broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young, dumb, broke, high school kids

[Verse 2: Elton John]
We have so much in common
We argue all the time
You always say I'm wrong, but...
I'm pretty sure I'm right
What's fun about commitment?
When we have our life to live
Yeah, we're just young dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus: Elton John]
While we're young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb, broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young, dumb, broke high school kids

[Bridge: Elton John]
Jump and we think - do it all in the game of love
Love
Run into sin, do it all in the name of fun
Fun
Whoa-oa-oa
I'm so high at the moment
I’m so caught up in this
Yeah, we’re just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus: Elton John & Khalid]
While we're young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb, broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young, dumb, broke high school kids

[Outro: Elton John & Khalid, Khalid & Elton John]
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young, dumb, broke high school kids
Yeah, whoa
Young, dumb, broke high school kids
Young, dumb, broke high school kids

[Verse 1]
Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something
Been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight
So stick around
You're gonna hear electric music
Solid walls of sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Ooh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Bennie, she's really keen

[Chorus]
She's got electric boots
A mohair suit
I read it in a magazine, oh, oh
Bennie and the Jets

[Verse 2]
Hey kids, why don't you plug into the faithless?
Maybe they're blinded
But Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Ooh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Bennie, she's really keen

[Chorus]
She's got electric boots
A mohair suit
I read it in a magazine, oh, oh
Bennie and the Jets

[Pre-Chorus]
Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Ooh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Bennie, she's really keen

[Chorus]
She's got electric boots
A mohair suit
I read it in a magazine, oh, oh
Bennie and the Jets

[Outro]
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Ooh, yes
Ooh, yeah

Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?

[Intro]
Excuse me!
Can I have the attention of the class for one second?

[Verse 1]
Hi, kids! Do you like Primus? (Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
Wanna see me stick 9 inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh huh!)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
Try 'cid and get messed up worse than my life is?
My brain's dead weight, I'm trying to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
And Dr. Dre said "Slim Shady, you a basehead!"
Uh-uh! "So why's your face red? Man, you wasted!"
Well, since age twelve I felt like a caged elf
Who stayed to himself in one space, chasing his tail
Got ticked off and ripped Pamela Lee's lips off
Kissed 'em and said "I ain't know silicone was supposed to be this soft!"
I'm about to pass out and crash, and fall in the grass
Faster than the fat man who sat down too fast
Come here, lady! "Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dog!"
I don't give a damn, Dre sent me to tick the world off

[Hook]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?

[Verse 2]
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Damn)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser
Chased him with a stapler, and told him to change the grade on the paper (Now!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Served the bartender, then walked out with the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship
While they're screaming at me, "Let's just be friends!"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her (Here mom!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, elohssa"

[Hook]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady

[Verse 3]
Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of Kool-Aid, dare me to drive? (Go ahead!)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops!)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll "-" anything that walks
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and tap myself in the head
I'm steaming mad and by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Ask him if he bought a porno mag to see my ad

[Hook]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, who? My name is, huh?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?

[Intro]
I'm not really drunk, I never get that fucked up
I'm not, I'm so sober

[Verse 1]
Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are
(Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are)
I'm on the other side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark
(I'm on the other side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark)
No one's got to know what we do, hit me up when you're bored
(No one's got to know)
Nah (what we do, hit me up when you're bored)
'Cause I live down the street, so we meet when you need it, it's yours
All I hear is

[Chorus]
Nothin' feels better than this
Nothin' feels better
Nothin' feels better than this
Nothin' feels better, no, no
We don't gotta hide
This is what you like, I admit
Nothin' feels better than this

[Drop]
Nothin' feels better, better than this
Nothin' feels better, better than this

[Verse 2]
You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around
(You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around)
You keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feeling it now?
(Keep my hand around your neck)
Cause I am (we connect, are you feeling it now?)
I got so high the other night, I swear to God, I felt my feet leave the ground
(I got so high the other night, I swear to God)
Ooh yeah (felt my feet leave the ground)
Your back against the wall, this is all we've been talkin' about
In my ears

[Chorus]
Nothin' feels better than this (no, no, no)
Nothin' feels better
Nothin' feels better than this
Nothin' feels better, no, no
We don't got to hide
This is what you like, I admit
Nothin' feels better than this
Nothin' feels better than this

[Drop]
Nothin' feels better, better than this
Nothin' feels better, better than this
I'm sorry for the things
I said to you last night
I drank a lot
And I felt a lot
And it hurts me too
When I think of you
When I think of

Twenty years
We spent inside this house
Without a door
Now we got kids
And we got cash
And we got bones
And we got ash
But we're not home

Let's steal some marijuana from the kids
I know where they keep it hid
Let's torch the bed
And steal the gun
Let's hold up 7/11
Let's stop the world and shut it down
We'll burn the whole thing to the ground
I sure hope
That it's insured
Cause I already hear the flames roar

Take it, take it
Take it, take it
Take it, take it
Take it, take it
Wait, wait
Wait a minute
'Cause there's a lot
Of people that moved here over fall

Come, move on, I'm dying
Yeah, it's a lot
Like mine, except a lot
Less overwhelmed
I was born inside the sun
And my name is Pierson
I just wanna have some fun
And my name is Pierson
I've been buying you a ton
And my name is Pierson

Wanna come home looking
Oh so nice
Just come and join
The Cult Of Lord Jesus H. Christ

Wanna come home looking
Oh so nice
Just come and join
The Cult Of Lord Jesus H. Christ

Wanna come home looking
Oh so nice
Just come and join
The Cult Of Lord Jesus H. Christ
Wanna come home looking
Oh so nice
Just come and join the cult

I just wanna be someone
Is that too much to want?
I've been sitting in your grave
Are we still elated?

I don't understand a thing
Don't wanna make me think
I know I know everything
Don't wanna make you think

I was born inside the sun
My name is Pierson
I've been waiting for a woman I can call my own (he can call his own)
A lady I can call late at night on the telephone (on the telephone)
Her daddy won't like the looks of a kid like me (of a kid like me)
She'll tell him to get lost 'cause she loves me (cause she loves me)

Don't worry, honey, 'cause nothing ever bothers me
You can be the flower and I'll be the goddamn bee
Now, what's so special about a thing that comes so naturally
Well, I don't know, babe, 'cause nothing ever fazes me

[Intro: Gucci Mane & DJ Holiday]
