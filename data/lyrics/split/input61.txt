ike dookie
When you're tryna start a movement and come up on a movie role
Everything's polished
I ain't go to college, I was at the conference
Chopping with the DJs, tryna give my single on replay
And shit up on the game like colonics (colonics)
Hold the phone, take a flick with a fan for me (click)
Hit the strips with a brick of the dance money (strip)
I'm tired, let's switch with the van for me
When I make it by, you'll print the advance money

[Chorus: Nikki Jean & Lupe Fiasco]
Who, who, who (ay)
Hip-Hop, won't you save me? Rescue all your babies
Who, who, who (ay)
Hip-Hop, won't you save me? I am just a baby

[Post-Chorus: Lupe Fiasco & Nikki Jean]
Said I'm gonna be a rapper when I grow up
Not gonna go crazy when I blow up
Bet they gonna go crazy when I show up
Won't listen to the haters cause I know what
Said I'm gonna be a rapper when I grow up
Said I'm gonna be slow if I pour up
But I'm gonna be poor if I slow up
So I gotta keep it going, ain't no slow motion in here

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Hold up, light man, turn the lights on
Came a long way from when I was holding the mic wrong
Something for the hood and a whole lot of white songs
Like I evolved to a whole 'nother life form
I'm just tryna make it happen, don't attack that please
Can't find a job, you can rap at least
Cause that's what I did, I was at that league
Right out of high school, tryna stack that cheese
You was tryna do what? Tryna stack that cheese
You wanna flip burgers, wanna stack that cheese
Make American singles, wanna stack that cheese
Make everybody smile, tryna stack that cheese
Tryna do it for a while, tryna stack that cheese
Talking frequent flyer miles how I stack that cheese
Tryna bundle up the money, tryna stack that cheese
Aye Stack, can we stack that please?

[Chorus: Nikki Jean & Lupe Fiasco]
Who, who, who (ay)
Hip-Hop, won't you save me? Rescue all your babies
Who, who, who (ay)
Hip-Hop, won't you save me? I am just a baby

[Post-Chorus: Lupe Fiasco & Nikki Jean]
Said I'm gonna be a rapper when I grow up
Not gonna go crazy when I blow up
Bet they gonna go crazy when I show up
Won't listen to the haters cause I know what
Said I'm gonna be a rapper when I grow up
Said I'm gonna be slow if I pour up
But I'm gonna be poor if I slow up
So I gotta keep it going, ain't no slow motion in here

[Outro: Nikki Jean & Lupe Fiasco]
Who, who, who (ay)
Hip-Hop, won't you save me? Rescue all your babies
Who, who, who (ay)
Hip-Hop, won't you save me? I am just a baby
Said I'm gonna be a rapper when I grow up
Not gonna go crazy when I blow up
Bet they gonna go crazy when I show up
Won't listen to the haters cause I know what
Said I'm gonna be a rapper when I grow up
Said I'm gonna be slow if I pour up
But I'm gonna be poor if I slow up
So I gotta keep it going, ain't no slow motion in here

Can I? Can I? Oh
Can I keep you in mind?
Don't move you got a lot to lose
And if you walk away it won't be fair

[Verse 1]
I can't get there on my own
You can't leave me here alone
I’m just trying to do what’s right
Oh a man ain't a man 'less he's fought the fight
I could never point you out
Waste of space in a faceless crowd
Tell me what I have to say
If you know what’s right, then you’ll walk away

[Chorus]
When the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down

[Verse 2]
One by one I've seen em fall
Some just don’t show up at all
I’m just here to fight the fire
Oh a man ain’t a man 'less he has desire

[Chorus]
And the walls come down
And the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down

[Bridge]
You tore out my heart
And you threw it away
The western girl with eastern eyes
Took a wrong turn and found surprise awaits
Now there’s nothing in the way
In the way
In the way
In the way

[Chorus]
When the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down

[Outro]
You tore out my heart
You threw it away
The western girl with eastern eyes
Took a wrong turn and found surprise awaits
Now there’s nothing in the way
In the way
In the way
In the way

[Verse 1]
Young, wild, American
Lookin' to be somethin'
Out of school go-go'n
For a hundred or two
Some asshole broke me in
Wrecked all my innocence
I'll just keep go-go'n
And this dance is on you

[Pre-Chorus]
One, five, ten, lay a million on me
Before the end of this song

[Chorus]
Young, wild, American
C'mon baby, do you have a girlfriend?
Rain on me a million

Oh, I
I might not be flawless, but you know
I got a diamond heart

[Pre-Chorus]
One, five, ten, lay a million on me
Before the end of this song

Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown

[Verse 1]
I lay around, touch myself to pass the time
I feel down, I wish you were mine
I close my eyes
Take a breath and I picture us in a place
I can't recognize

[Pre-Chorus]
In the fire I call your name out

Up all night tryin' to rub the pain out
(oh-o-oh-oo-ahh-ahh)

Swirl around as if I'm someone else

Pretend that I am you until it clicks
I come alive
Come alive

[Pre-Chorus]
In the fire I call your name out
(call your name out, call your name out)
(oh-o-oh-oo-ahh-ahh) (call your name out)
Up all night tryin' to rub the pain out
(oh-o-oh-oo-ahh-ahh) (rub the pain out)

Hurts inside, but not this time
All the things that are on my mind
Vanish as I touch myself
Call out loud for you
Oh, can you hear me singin'?

[Chorus]
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
I'm singin'
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely

[Post-Chorus]
Tap down those boots while I beat around

[Verse 1]
I was 23
She was 35
I was spiralin' out
And she was so alive
A Texas girl real strong
Taught me this drunk song
So when I start to bawl
She says, "let your teardrops fall"

[Laughter]

[Verse 1]
Everybody's got to love each other
Stop throwin' stones at your sisters and your brothers
Man, it wasn't that long ago we were all living in the jungle
So why do we gotta put each other down
When there's more than enough love to g-g-go around?

[Chorus]
Come to mama
Tell me who hurt ya
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out

[Verse 2]
Dude in a lab coat and a man of God
(Come onto mama, come on, mama)
Fought over prisms and a forty-day flood
(Come onto mama, come on, mama)
Well, I say rainbows did more than they've ever done
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
So why do we gotta fight over ideas?
(Aah, aah, aah)
We're talkin' the same old shit after all of these years
(Ayi, yi, yi)

[Chorus]
Come to mama
Tell me who hurt ya
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out
Oh, come tomorrow
Who are you gonna follow?
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out

[Verse 3]
Psychic guru catches minnows in the harbor
(Come onto mama, come on, mama)
Everyone tells him he should work a little harder
(Come onto mama, come on, mama)
{Hey, man, get to work! Catch 'em!}
They all tell you that freedom must be bought
But baby, he's already caught 'em
So why do we gotta tell each other how to live?
The only prisons that exist are ones we put each other in

[Chorus]
Come to mama
Tell me who hurt ya
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out
Oh, come tomorrow
Who are you gonna follow?
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out

The only prisons that exist are ones we put each other in
Why do we gotta tell each other how to live?
Look what that rainbow did
Oo-hoo woohoo-oo-hoo woohoo-hoo
Oo-hoo woohoo-oo-hoo woohoo-hoo
Oo-hoo woohoo-oo-hoo woohoo-hoo

[Intro]
Yeah man, play that New York drum, Homer
Show 'em how we do it
Downtown

[Verse 1]
Just another way to prove
I love you, when it's hard today
I'll lay back in my chair and find a way
And when you say that thing that you say
That makes me mad, I'll turn away
I'll turn away
I'll turn away

[Pre-Chorus]
And think of different ways to keep my spirits up
And choreograph hours with playful, joyish thoughts

[Chorus]
We both know I could learn a thing or two
About relaxing, hey I love you
And after all it's just another day

[Verse 2]
Oh, I could use some two or three
Or other kind of ways to be
But today I won't be so hard on me
I'll walk alone down a different street
And smile at all the new strange I meet

[Pre-Chorus]
And pick up unique style, I'll kick around today
And create simple thoughts
I'll laugh in humble ways

[Chorus]
We both know
I could learn a thing or two
About behavin'
But I love you
And after all it's just another day

Come on, Mark!

[Instrumental Bridge]

Ladies and gentlemen, Brian Newman

[Chorus]
We both know
I could learn a thing or two
About behavin'
But I love you
And after all, it's just another day

[Outro]
Oooooh oooo, oooooh oooo
Oooooh oooo, oooooh oooo
Oooooh oooo, oooooh oooo
And after all
It's just another day

[Verse 1]
I confess I am lost
In the age of the social
On our knees, take a test
To be lovin' and grateful

[Pre-Chorus]
Shots were fired on the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
But the people just stood around

[Chorus]
I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

[Verse 2]
Doesn't everyone belong
In the arms of the sacred?
Why do we pretend we're wrong?
Has our young courage faded?

[Pre-Chorus]
Shots were fired on the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
Why do people just stand around?

[Chorus]
I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

[Bridge]
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo

[Chorus]
I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

[Outro]
Save that angel
Catch that angel
Save that angel
Catch that angel
Save that angel
Catch that angel
Save that angel
Catch that angel

That the chair I've been sittin' on is a throne
Affection kneels at the seat of my soul

Tell the truth, it can't get no better (Better)

[Verse 1]
I see the grass beneath me
I smell the wind and sky
And think to myself
"Don't pass me by"
You dance in strange conditions with strangers of the night
I see you're crazy and so am I
You bled out red and blue
The boys of NYU, they saw you coming from miles away
Nothing is quite as homey
We dive each sunny day
I see you Kenny, you castaway

[Chorus]
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over anymore
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over anymore

[Verse 2]
Bright lights, that make the city
Quaaludes on Christmas Eve
And all the good times, we've ever seen
The roles we play together
The slaps across my face
I face the music
You write the scene

[Chorus]
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over anymore
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over anymore

[Bridge]
My angel hovers over
The light comes crashing in
I know it’s how this here story ends
I'll hang around forever
Until you cut me down
All pressed and ready to face the crowd

[Chorus]
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over anymore
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over anymore

[Verse 1]

It’s strong as hell and black as night
I keep my love all screwed up tight
And spread it thick whenever I like, I like

[Chorus]
Vegemite
I like Vegemite

[Bridge]
And when everyone’s getting grumpy 'cause it’s early
I’ll have breakfast with my girlfriend
And we’ll have toast with avocados
And tomatoes and Vegemite

Cos I love, I love my Vegemite
It’s strong as hell and black as night
I keep my love all screwed up tight
And spread it thick whenever I like, I like

I'll end a nigga life with a gun or a knife (Huh?)
I'll take a nigga girl, I'll fuck a nigga wife
If you do it in the dark, then it's coming to light (Bling)
Got the plug pullin' up to the park with the white (Skrrt)
On the Crest with a vest and a tech and a check
Don't do it the best, but I'll do it to the death
Don't need you to do it, I'll do it myself

[Chorus]
I called my chick and said "I need some more of that" (Mwah)
The way she put it on me, at a loss for words (Yeah)
I called my plug and said "I need some more of that" (Huh?)
A thousand pounds of herb and plus a lot of birds
I'm sipping lean, I'm 'bout to pour some more of that (Yeah)
I think I need about a thousand pints of syrup (Wow)
You make me mad, then I'ma fuck your hoe for that (For real?)
I got your bitch with me, I know your feelings hurt

[Verse 2]
Your bitch is with me and your bitch is a flirt (Ha)
Limpin' with pimpin' I know that it hurt
Took off her dress and I took her to dinner
Then took off my shirt and she took off her skirt
Smoking on purp and I brought out the vert
Hating on Gucci is making it worse (Yeah)
Your dick in the dirt and my goons on alert
And I wonder if this nigga can fill up a church (Wow)
All of my niggas still fuck with the work
Fucking with Gucci's a gift and a curse (Yeah)
Fell on her dress then I fell on her breast
If I'm feeling like that, then I fill up her purse (True)
Play with me, nigga, you ride in a hearse
Pay me and pull up, these choppers will burst
Hit in the head and I know that it hurt
Dead on arrival no need of a nurse (No)
You think that it's funny, you owe me some money
You niggas be' pay me my cash by the first
Fuck with my cheese and these 40s'll burst
Got a hole for you niggas real deep in the earth
I'm fucking your bitch, but she sucking me first (Yeah)
Roll me a blunt and I pour me some purp
Gucci the boss and your life has a cost
Play with my money, I blow up your house

[Chorus]
I called my chick and said "I need some more of that" (Mwah)
The way she put it on me, at a loss for words (Yeah)
I called my plug and said "I need some more of that" (Huh?)
A thousand pounds of herb and plus a lot of birds
I'm sipping lean, I'm 'bout to pour some more of that (Yeah)
I think I need about a thousand pints of syrup (Wow)
You make me mad, then I'ma fuck your hoe for that (For real?)
I got your bitch with me, I know your feelings hurt

[Verse 1: Quavo & Rara]
Ridin' down 85, three in the morning (Skrrt, skrrt; skrrt)
Why you pull me over sayin' you smell marijuana? (Smellin' the gas)
I said I got a ID, I got glaucoma (Yeah, I got ID)
He said, "We ain't in Cali nigga, get out, put your hands up" (Uh)
Runnin' real hard shook the taser (Shook the taser)
Runnin' real hard shook the taser (Shook the taser)
I told him can we split it, we gon' shake 'em (Split up)
Nigga hit my phone when you made it (Brrt)

Make the gun sound off for Mike Brown (Mike Brown)
Take a nigga life when you face down (Face down)
Hoodie gang strong like Trayvon (Like Trayvon)
Gun by the window like Detroit Red (Yeah)
Bring that shit by the neck of my woods
And bet a nigga ass end up dead
Pig in a blanket, fuck was you thinkin'?
Free that nigga Boosie, runnin' at the police
Left him with a slow leak, right outside VC
Tryna keep a Phantom like DC
Hangout the G like free Meek (Yeah)
Kill a nigga reachin' for a cell phone (Cell phone)
Hurt to tell his mama he ain't comin' home
That's why I stay strapped all summer long
And you know it (Yeah)

Black man (Black man)
Running from the law like Pac-Man
Try and throw the RAW all in the trash can (Throw the RAW)
Got smoked by a cop on the dash cam (Nasty)
Mug shot on the news, he a mad man
When all he did was hustle to run the cash in
He feedin' kids in jail if he wasn't crackin' (No)
Too many felonies on my jacket
All of my brothers turn to assassins
We seen too many brothers get put in caskets
Too many young baby mothers and baby daddies
In the graveyard back then
I went from sittin' on clubs to the cashmere
You shoulda seen how I flossed on 'em last year
Two Maybachs and I had a bad year
Young nigga countin' money like a cashier
White man wanna pay me like I'm U-N-O (Lock me up)
Niggas wanna see me at my funeral (Lock me up)
Neither of my own homie wanna do me though (Lock me up)
Layin' on my dog crib like I'm Snoopy though (Not enough)
That's my nigga, I ain't even wanna do it though
If I don't do it, shit I know he gon' do me though
Cause he broke and he trippin' 'bout stupid hoes
But I'm a Don just like motherfuckin' Julio

It is because that I'm perfect?

[Verse 4: T.I.]
Police see I got my hands up
Still wanna kill me, they don't understand us
They be lookin' for a reason just to shoot me
And wanna do me how they do us in the movies
Or how they do it out in Baton Rouge
Or Ferguson, or Florida, or Baltimore, they make excuses
Like I did cause I thought he had a pistol
Or I did it cause I thought he was a Muslim
My message to America, felon or death here
The liquor we die, we just substances left here
First you put us in a small hood
And then you beat us and you treat us like it's all good
And then shoot us and you screw us economically, mentally
Killin' nigga, no penalty, they can do that shit legally
Bet I can make that ass think 'fore you shoot
You kill me, man there gon' be more of some riotin' and lootin'
We say black lives matter, you say all lives
But y'all ain't the ones gettin' hogtied
Persecuted, executed, one day it gon' be time for retribution
Hope you don't ever see your son in an institution
I know karma is constant and God ain't no nonsense
You doin' wrong just to run shit
One day the time gon' run out for the dumb shit
Ain't no deception, tryna get in Heaven
You gettin' nailed, bet it's on your Mary
And you know what you did for who how much you really care
And what you really felt, he gon' deny the opportunity to unify
With people who look similar to you and I
Cause he don't wanna have a

[Chorus: Quavo]
Black man, drop top (Drop top)
There go the cops
There go the cops

Is it because of my jersey? (Huh?)
It is because that you nervous?
Black man, drop top (Drop top)
There go the cops
There go the cops
There go the cops
Is it because of my people?
Is it because of my sneakers?
Is it because of my jersey?
It is because that I'm perfect?

[Intro]
I have two brief questions I'd like to ask, if I may
When you were carrying out that incredible moonwalk
Did you find that the surface was equally firm anywhere
Or were there harder and softer spots that you could detect?
And secondly, when you looked up at the sky could you actually See the stars, and the Solar Corona, in spite of the glare?

We were never able to see stars from the lunar surface
Or on the daylight side of the moon
But I - without looking through the optics, uh
I don't recall during the period of time that we were
Photographing the Solar Corona what stars we could see
(I don't remember seeing any)

[Hook]
Giant steps are what you take, walking on the moon
I hope my legs don't break, walking on
Walking on the moon

[Verse 1]
B.o.B, what the hell you doing?
What the fuck does Stanley Kubrick have to do with
Astronauts and moon men
Who the hell you fooling?
Fuck you and this whole stupid flat Earth movement
Well, if you don't like it sue me, even science proves it
You're a college student, shouldn't be assuming
Green screen, sound stage, sound proofing
Time to film a movie shoot
Gotta use my tools in the glass case
Astronaut suit footprint don't match the boot
Been to the moon once and ain't been back since
And I'm just trying to figure out where the tax dollars went
NASA

[Hook]
Giant steps are what you take, walking on the moon
I hope my legs don't break, walking on
Walking on the moon

[Verse 2]
Not a huge fan of the award for the best rapper
But they give the moon man award to the best actor
Guess we must go straight to the source and let's ask NASA
Uh, how do you explain the occurrence of lunar waves?
Why do we only see one half of the lunar face?
How do you explain air bubbles you view in space?
Why is it so important to lie to the human race?
Million mile internet that travels light years
But they can't show a space shuttle re-enter the atmosphere, okay
To blast off you gotta practice Freemasonry
An acronym that stands for Not A Space Agency

[Hook: B.o.B]
Giant steps are what you take, walking on the moon
I hope my legs don't break, walking on
Walking on the moon

Some may say, I'm wishing my days away, no way
And if it's the price I pay, some say
Tomorrow's another day, you'll stay
Walking on, walking on the moon

[Verse 1]
Standing in the kitchen
Wondering where Anjela's gone
She didn't even drive here
She couldn't have gotten very far

[Pre-Chorus]
What does it matter anyways?
I didn't like her anyways
I only let her crawl into my arms
I wasn't trying to lead anyone on
I was only trying to stay warm

[Chorus]
Oh Anjela
Can't stand the cold
And it's not summer anymore
I haven't seen the last of her

[Verse 2]
There was euphemisms and arrangements
There was alleged transgressions
She said, "I'm not very good at talking about this stuff
So nevermind"
She buried her face in the pillow

[Pre-Chorus]
What does it matter anyways?
She didn't like me anyways
I only thought because she climbed into my arms
But she wasn't trying to turn anyone on
She was only trying to stay warm

[Chorus]
Oh Anjela
Can't stand the cold
And it's not summer anymore
I haven't seen the last of her

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake with Anna Kendrick]
Do you remember
The 21st night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

[Verse 1: Anna Kendrick]
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night
Remember how the stars stole the night away

[Chorus: Earth, Wind & Fire]
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancin' in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

[Post-Chorus: Earth, Wind & Fire]
Ba duda, ba duda, ba duda, badu
Ba duda, badu, ba duda, badu
Ba duda, badu, ba duda

[Verse 2: Anna Kendrick]
My thoughts are with you
Holdin' hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Now December found the love we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember, the true love we share today

[Chorus: Earth, Wind & Fire]
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancin' in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

And we say
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancin' in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

[Verse 3: Justin Timberlake]
The bell was ringin', aha
Our souls were singin'

Never was a cloudy day

[Chorus: Earth, Wind & Fire]

Uh huh! (Bring it back now)
Dancin' in September
Uh huh!
All the way down to the summer

[Verse 1: B. Rossi]
She done put her reparations in a handbag
He done spent his reparations on his swag, swag
A black nigga, put your fortunes in a sandbag
Laugh at your misfortune then we put it in a hashtag
Ain't no leaders only leisure, only reapers, ain't no sowers
They get higher, we get lower, damn it's over
If racism ain't in color then it's damn sure in the class
Got the races on each other, you got niggas then there's blacks
You got crackers then there's whites, separated by the green
After five hundred years, think we play for the same team
Smokescreen, make the president the black guy
It ain't no reason why you shouldn't have success, right?

[Chorus: B. Rossi]
Forty acres and a Muller
I spent my reparations on the jeweler
I bought a timepiece, now ain't no lookin' back
Now ask them muthafuckas what the fuck they lookin' at
Uh, forty acres and a mule, forty acres and a mule
These niggas actin' fuckin' fools for forty acres and a mule

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Anybody interrupt freedom, kill 'em
Word to Robert F. Williams, feel 'em
Devil got me sick to my stomach, boo
Word to Elijah Muhammad, ooh
I don't give a damn what the preacher ever tell y'all
Jesus, Muhammad, ain't comin', woo
I'mma tell y'all what the ancestors shoulda done did when they seen the first boat comin, yeah
Killed every man, child, woman, yeah
Killed every damn thing on it, yeah
Killed everything if it looked European
Send it back to the Queen like, ho
You ever step your foot in Kemet, bitch we slit your throat
We send them funny fuck boy preacher types back to the Pope
Fuck is you? Fuck your Zeus or fuck Medusa
This the school of Shaka Zulu
Fast forward to the future, choppa do you
We done dyin' and they cryin' and we screamin' hallelujah
When them crackas ask why say we did it for Lumumba, fucker

[Chorus: B. Rossi]
Forty acres and a Muller
I spent my reparations on the jeweler
I bought a timepiece, now ain't no lookin' back
Now ask them muthafuckas what the fuck they lookin' at
Uh, forty acres and a mule, forty acres and a mule
These niggas actin' fuckin' fools for forty acres and a mule

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Load up my clip off a Zimmerman
Filling my pocket with Benjamins
Who the fuck are you? I been a man
Them crackers see me "oh not him again"
Take your ass out the trap middle finger to Trump
Fuck the police, they crooked as they come
They pull you over and know you legit
Ask you for your license, when you reach then they dump
Now the prison yard like the cotton field
House nigga's snitchin', that's what got 'em killed
Nigga thought he made it cause he got a deal
First album suppo' been outta here
Not quite dude, back to selling blow
On some 24s I'mma send it here, learn to stay silent
Learn more on these streets then they did in they college
I'm certified, don't murder guys
But my niggas still far from civilized
Kill for anything but civil rights be the murder case
Cause a nigga like, they heard it from the king, from the king
What you mean, bitch?
Trade my forty acres from my mule and my necklace, yeah

[Chorus: B. Rossi]
Forty acres and a Muller
I spent my reparations on the jeweler
I bought a timepiece, now ain't no lookin' back
Now ask them muthafuckas what the fuck they lookin' at
Uh, forty acres and a mule, forty acres and a mule
These niggas actin' fuckin' fools for forty acres and a mule

[Intro: T.I.]
Make sure what you ride for
Is somethin' you would die for
Make sure what you ride for

[Verse 1: T.I.]
All my nigga wanna do is hit a lick and flip some raw
Boy you better prepare yourself, them people finna set it off
What you oughta wanna do is get this money too with me
Even if you Bobby Seale, you gon' need a Huey P
I'm doin' me, international fluently
Speak the lingo my people talk
Don't disrespect my people, dog
Or turn the other cheek, that ain't the shit that we were taught
Arm yourself, defend yourself, they try you get to squeezin' off
We've been out crazy
Do you like it in them jeans dawg?
Season dog, leave me out know they don't want me involved
I'm dodgin' 12, they be on watch
But I'm just ridin' with my home boys

[Chorus: Trev Case]
Switchin' through lanes like hey-ey-ey
Paint drippin', swing with this .30 on me
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
Switchin' through lanes like hey-ey-ey
Paint drippin', swing with this .30 on me
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
We talkin' high life, listenin' to UGK
Ridin' dirty mean you clean on swangers
If them law pull up then that means danger
Turn up the changer, bangin' out the whip
They muffle the signs, all the hoe shit that we were dealin' with
Cause we be young and in the hustle
Partna sellin‘ whole, but no food in the cupboard like damn
I really wanna be a millionaire one day, one day
My nigga say yeah
We dyin' out here for a little bit of neck but the government just don't care
So I'm talkin' Multi to the fullest
As long as I'm livin', fuck the ones
When I was young, they let me ride shot gun
And show me how to get it
And you can ball all you want in the paint for the digits
But you gotta learn how to pivot
For the score, never speak, bet the goal that you want
Gotta keep it slow mo when you outchea grippin'
Watch for the lows when your head up high
Head in the sky and you're outchea tippin'
All you've got is your word and your bond
Prepare for the hate when you're switchin' suites

[Chorus: Trev Case]
Switchin' through lanes like hey-ey-ey
Paint drippin', swing with this .30 on me
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
Switchin' through lanes like hey-ey-ey
Paint drippin', swing with this .30 on me
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I'm either out or I'm all in it
This shit creek and we all in it
One false move and we all finish
We come together, we all winnin'
But you'd rather go and get your dogs in it
Either rob for the money, hit the mall with it
Then to the club, pull the broad with it
Then wylin' chopper in it, I'm goin' down with it, no lie
You get a chance, go to Dubai
You see your money ain't as much as you thought
Matter of fact motherfuckers so rich
Make nigga feel petty and ashamed just for showin' it off
100 thou for the outfit
A billion dollars worth of sun plugged in the outlet
You put your money where your mouth at
You won't be talkin' much would ya
If you was weren't about shit
Revolutionary do it for the niggas that wish they were there to do it
Gotta chance to do me boy you better do it
Nigga comin' back and shootin' very good
Speakin' better than a felon would
Got me property up in Ellenwood
And my position, I just fell into it
Devil want my soul and I ain't sell it to him

[Chorus: Trev Case]
Switchin' through lanes like hey-ey-ey
Paint drippin', swing with this .30 on me
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
Switchin' through lanes like hey-ey-ey
Paint drippin', swing with this .30 on me
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec

[Outro: T.I.]
Make sure what you ride for

Make sure what you ride for

[Intro]
Uh, yeah

[Verse]
Artificial drug dealer
Major league thug, wanna be a killer, courtroom seat filler
In an overseas villa water front, won't blink
Think of Martin Luther King, we shall overcome
G3, layin' every bad bitch you wanna cuff
Get the run for they money, having fun for the money
UGK Alumni, yeah that's how I run my shit
Sittin' in the Bentley make her sell a Hyundai
Take extraordinary measures to some temporary pleasures
And my view from the pool say the world could be better
To the naked eye bunch of naked thighs, naked asses
They fake and they don't matter, pretty titties out dancin'
And I lead the advance of the young black man
But my flesh ain't as strong and my mind is man
Wanna make it great again when the time is man
400 years later motherfuckers still playin'
Like the cotton fields, some wounds time never heals
Tossin' culture and religion to the side, gave us his
Askin' God, "What’s the purpose? Paying tithes every service"
Every sermon all I hear is what I owe and what he earn
Seems that the world turnin' like the whole world burnin'
Leavin' hell here and this shit just gettin' worse every year
Hell ya, say money, hoes, cars, clothes
What my life was all about but that's before I thought about it
What the world would be like when my daughter 25
Would I prevent or contribute to my grandson dyin'
Like my nigga Thugga daughter I was motherfuckin' tired
Dead asleep when the meal came, I ain't never had shit
But the dream that the team live above average
Multi million dollar mansion, million plus advances
He knowin' the advancement and takin' our chances
And knowin' they'd rather see me in prison than at Stanford
I swear

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Know they'd rather see me in prison than at Stanford
I swear, yeah-yeah
Woah-uh-huh
I was motherfuckin' tired and I swear
I was motherfuckin' tired and I swear
Yeah
Shit ain’t sweet as it seems, I just make it look good
Been a long ride, hard road
Everybody couldn't do this shit
And look at me I still look good as a girl, God damn
Hahahaha
All I need is a good head of hair like Kendrick, and I’ll be alright
You know?
He wish he had my motherfuckin' six pack though
So you know I'm saying, even swap ain’t no swindle
Hahahaha
Get it how you live nigga
Get do or die partna
Love and loyalty
What we put together no body could bring it above me
You know what I mean
Hustle Gang over everything, Yeah

Bitch quit talking, Crip walk, stay down with the set
Take a bullet with some dick and take this dope from this jet
Out of town, put it down for the Father of Rap

Come back, get back, that's the part of success
If you believe in the S you'll be relieving your stress

[Interlude: Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre]

Dre and Snoop chronic-ed out in the 'llac
With Doc in the back, sipping on 'gnac (yeah)
Clip in the strap, dipping through hoods (what hoods)
Compton, Long Beach, Inglewood
South Central out to the west side
It's California Love, this California bud got a nigga gang of pub
I'm on one, I might bail up in the Century Club

[Intro]
Masters of war
Build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
All the money you made will never buy back your soul

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Hercules, nigga, you heard of me, nigga
I verbally murder these niggas
Blame on a bitch nigga look like some Burt's Bees, nigga
They talking 'bout actual topics and dropping on actual knowledge to purpose these niggas
I ain't worshipping these niggas
Man it's curtains for these niggas
Man I'm hurdling these niggas
Put a hurting on these niggas
Ah ah ah, skirting on these niggas
Pick up a leaf and I roll up the purplest weed in them
Bobby Ray cold as a negative thirty degrees winter
The world is so cold that a Po' gotta murder to eat dinner
The world is so cold nigga you could get murdered just eating dinner
That's 'cause the world is as flat as some perfectly creased denim
Perfectly creased denim, perfectly creased denim
Feel like the youth is lost and ain't no reaching them
By day I be teaching them
By night I'm a heathen, um
Chilling with freaks and a ghetto Eritreans
Plus a Norwegian, look like I least see them
Pull up outside, wheels big as Elysium
Haters like, "Hey, that's nice, I hear they was leasing them"
So many thoughts on my head my fucking cerebrum numb
The world is a stage, America steady policing 'em
Niggas don't want the facts, just the convenient ones

[Refrain]
All the money you made will never buy back your soul

[Verse 2]
Uh, buy your soul back, buy your soul back
I expose facts, that's why my phones tapped
Hollywood turned you while you coming up broke back
On my coattail, bitch, give my coat back
Niggas behave the same as how they souls act
Like a high school kid back when I would smoke blacks
I would light up the whole pack, stinking up the whole class
Had to find my own lane, had to find my own path
Crisis, I see Isis, slightly blind from these devices
Might be bias, Michael Myers
What you want, I'm ten floors highers
Ha ha ha ha, like a velvet block(?)
Stacking my cheese on top, top top top
I put my team on top, bitches they scheme and plot
Whippin' the meanest drop top top top(?)
Look at my life, how is it perfect?
All the hell I survived, yeah I deserved it
So I'm shitting on niggas with twice the serving
All the thoughts on my head are quite disturbing
Same dude in the booth that I am in person
So whenever I die, I die with purpose, mother fucker
Bandz

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah yeah
I defy the limits, penmanship is wicked
I'm my only master and my own apprentice
How do I present this, tryna find a sentence
Guess to some extent I feel the end is near and clear of all your vision
Cold as cryogenics
Knowledge that's forbidden, knowledge in my lyrics
I've been in the kitchen, all the points I'm hitting
I'm just too direct, no such thing as hinting
Kick the shit now quit your bitching
Now cut the shit, let's get to business
I try to show whats hidden
Try to paint the picture, guess you just ain't photogenic
Get offended
Make you see the veil then I lift it
Been to hell it's (?) visit
Here's a breath of fresh air, it's been a minute, aye
How to make a murderer, better yet
How to make a terrorist, better yet
How to start a civil war, better yet
How to tax America, yeah yeah
Step by step by step by step get more in depth, don't panic
Don't panic, follow the rabbit
Bandz

[Intro: Method Man + Raekwon + Ghostface]
Oh yeah, coming through with my Shaolin crew
Two cent for a case, gimme St. Ide's brew
In the midst of broken bottles and crushed up cans
Methtical's in a jam, oh how dry I am
With St. Ides in my system
Crack another I'm blessed, let's go get the next one
And get over, the object is to stay sober
Lay on the sofa, better yet, dial my chauffeur
Call me the Wallabee Champ, stretched out, could never be Son
Ricochet daily hit the deli for a cold one
Naturally blessed, yes, my rap is like a laser beam
Laser beam, laser beam, laser beam...

[Intro: Alicia Keys]
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
So we all got children, products of the ghetto
Momma cooked the soup, daddy did the yelling
Uncle was a drunk, cousin was a felon
When he got pitched, he told them he wasn't tellin'
Auntie was a cook, her husband was a crook
Cause every job he had they be payin' him off the books
Ghetto university, knowledge is all it took
In a tenement I was listenin' to the hook
Change gon' come, the spirit of Sam Cooke
When the feds comin', everybody be shook
Now we doin' life like Eddie Murphy and Martin
On the chain gang, I was singing into the coffin

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
The roaches and the rats, heroin and the cracks
Couldn't blame me, I'm just giving the facts
I'm tryna hit the top, cause' bottom ain't where it's at
Everybody got a past but you can never go back

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Sing)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Sing)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Sing)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Sing)

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
Tellin' you like it is, how we ever gon' live?
If we ain't gettin' money, how we feedin' the kids?
It's a revolving door, where brothers be doin' bids
I know it sound wrong but the door will be what it is
Survival of the fittest, this poor girl the illest
Broke parents and black cats give me heebie-geebies
Life seems hard but nothin' ever comes easy
Whatever's in the dark, can always become the light
If you ain't in a battle, how you gon' win the fight?
I gotta speak the truth when I'm up in the booth
The streets be flyin' birds but they don't be on the roof
Poverty is a pain like you pullin' a tooth
Told the streets don't let me go like I'm Bishop in Juice

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Roaches and the rats, heroin and the cracks
Couldn't blame me, I'm just giving the facts
Tryna hit the top, the bottom ain't where it's at
Everybody got a past but you can never go back

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
(Gotta sing)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I could do what I want, I’d become an electrician
I’d crawl inside my ears and I’d rearrange the wires in my brain
A different me would be inhabiting this body
Have two cars, a garage, a job, and I would go to church on Sunday

A diagram of faulty circuitry explains how I was made
Now the engineer is listening as I voice all my complaints
From an orchestra of shaking metal, keeping me awake
I was just wondering if there’s any way that you made a mistake?

‘Cause I miss you the way that I miss nicotine
If it makes me feel better, how bad can it be?
Well, I heard there’s a fix for everything
Well then why, then why, then why, then why not me?

The first of April saw the sick and in repair
Wore my best shirt to the clinic, decorated with the laminate name
No one is laughing from an audience of folding plastic chairs
And I’m not fooled when you tell me that you’re glad I came

Am I honest to admit I’m just a hypocrite?
I know I should be being optimistic, but I’m doubtful I can change
Grit my teeth and try to act deserving
When I know there is nowhere I can hide from your humiliating grace
‘Cause if you swear that it’s true, then I have to believe
What I hear evangelicals say on TV
God, if there’s enough left after everyone else
Then why, then why, then why, then why not me?

[Verse 1]
You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Verse 2]
Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Bridge]
Hey, ehh, ehh, eyy
Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay, ehh, ehhy
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one

[Chorus]
When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Verse 1]
I confess I am lost
In the age of the social
On our knees, take a test
To be lovin' and grateful

[Pre-Chorus]
Shots were fired on the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
But the people just stood around

[Chorus]
I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

[Verse 2]
Doesn't everyone belong
In the arms of the sacred
Why do we pretend we're wrong?
Has our young courage faded?

[Pre-Chorus]
Shots were fired down the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
Why do people just stand around?

[Chorus]
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

[Verse 1]
(Dancing) I'm having so much love
(Dancing) Too bad my back had gone

I'd give my house in the country, if you'd slept, it's so funky

[Verse 2]
(Music) I'm dancing in the street
(Ooh, music) I've torn the shoes from my feet
(Romancing) It's got me dirty and sweet
It's got you reeling and rocking, won't you let the slender thing in?

[Verse 3]
(Rolling) I think it's all I can do
(Rolling) Just got me feeling you too
(Ooh, rolling) Give a little, take a little, give a little back
Jumping John, the great goose is gone
Got a lion in my hand, a Charlie on my back

[Chorus]

(She turns me on) Ooh, get you with me
(Don't get me wrong) Ah ha ha ha ha

[Verse 4]
(Dancing) have you heard the news?
(Dancing) President has got the blues
(Dancing) I tell you comfortably
If he gives it to you, he'd better take it from me

[Verse 5]
(Sad sir) I pick up your bones
(Sad sir) Leave the numbers alone
(Sad sir) Get off your telephones
Look the people in the eye, tell them my oh my
Let your backbone slide, buddy whistle and cry

[Chorus]
(John)
(She turns me on)
(She turns me on) La da la le la
(Don't get me wrong) Mmm hmm hmm
(I'm only dancing, hmm)
(I'm only dancing, hmm)
(John) I'm only dancing
(She turns me on) I'm only dancing
(She turns me on) I lost my fear
(Don't get me wrong) And I'm on my war
(I'm only dancing, hmm) Please dance with me
(I'm only dancing, hmm) Please dance with me
(I'm only dancing, hmm)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Couple million in cash it got me on some different shit
Walk in the booty club just for the shrimp and grits
Bitches staring at us like we super stars
The gangstas on the wall they all salute the gods
Lamborghini doors and rose gold Audemars
Middle of the dance floor and she snorting raw
All my accountants are held accountable
Had my suite for eight months tucked in the Fountaine Bleue
Just got my green bitch a green Chanel bag
Over 60 G's and never seen a sales tag
I pull a yacht out in the summer time
Can brag about the houses in another rhyme, boss

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
And I got two bitches on me freaky
You can't bring her home to mama, she too freaky
And I got two bitches and they're freaky
You can't bring her home to mama, she too freaky
Super, super, super, super, freaky
Super, super, super, super, freaky
Know you see these bands, what you gon' do for me?
I say fuck your man, what you gon' do for me?

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
Got the head three times cause she's super freaky
Had to hit the V Live for the super freaks
Head to G5 for the super freak
PT's out in Hialeah super freaking
Studio 23, I'm out with Vito
Then I hit up Golden Boy, he got the freak hoes
Fuck a bougie bitch, I need a super freak
Down to eat McDonald's, we don't do Phillipes
Fuck me the first night, you super freaking
Magnums on me, I'm not going out like Eazy
Bird call only for the freaks
Bird call only for the freaks

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
And I got two bitches on me freaky
You can't bring her home to mama, she too freaky
And I got two bitches and they're freaky

You know I dealt with you the nicest
Nuh body touch me you nuh righteous
Nuh badda, text me in a crisis
I believed all of your dreams, adoration
You took my heart and my keys and my patience
You took my heart on my sleeve for decoration
You mistaken my love I brought for you for foundation
All that I wanted from you was to give me
Something that I never had
Something that you've never seen
Something that you've never been!
Mmmmm!
But I wake up and act like nothing's wrong
Just get ready fi...

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, okay
You need to get done, done, done, done at work, come over
We just need to slow the motion
Don't give that away to no one
Long distance, I need you
When I see potential I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over
Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got niggas tryna end me, oh
I spilled all my emotions tonight, I’m sorry
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
How many more shots until you're rollin'?
We just need a face to face
You could pick the time and the place
You spent some time away
Now you need to forward and give me all the...

[Verse 1]
It's always around me, all this noise
But not nearly as loud as the voice saying
"Let it happen, let it happen (It's gonna feel so good)
Just let it happen, let it happen"

[Verse 2]
I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
And when it happens, when it happens (I won't be holding on)
So let it happen, let it happen
(It's gonna feel so good)

[Instrumental Break]
(It's gonna feel so good)

[Verse 3]

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
I will not vanish and you will not scare me
Tryna get through it, Tryna get through it
Try to bounce to it
You were not thinkin' that I will not do it
Why would I do it?
They be lovin' someone and I’m not that stupid
Take the next ticket to—
Take the next ticket to take the next train
Why would I do it?
And you wanna think that—
And you wanna—

[Instrumental Break]
(It's gonna feel so good)
(It's gonna feel so good)
(I will be holding on)

[Outro]
Let it happen, let it happen
Let it happen, let it happen
All this running around, trying to cover my shadow
An ocean growing inside, now all the others seem shallow
All this running around bearing down on my shoulders
I can hear an alarm, must be morning
(It's gonna feel so good)
Let it happen, let it happen
Just pet it happen, let it happen
(It's gonna feel so good)

Loves the black man for them record sales
I'm a slave to the game, I had to fight to get paid
But thanks Steve, I'm learning something new every day

Wouldn't sign them 'cause I wouldn't let you extort them
Lil Jon got my back, Ying Yang got my back
DJ Khaled got my back, Mr. Collipark got my back
You can own what I rap

[Verse 1]
Fuck that nigga, look at this nigga wrist
I'm a project nigga with a rich nigga dick
I got a Hollywood smile, but I'm from zone 6
I stunt so fuckin' hard I'm on my own dick
Baby think that she the shit because her man play for the Knicks
But my bitch keep turnin' up cause her man pay for the bricks
If she make me cum real quick, I give the bitch a stack
Here's a rack for you, a rack for her, give everyone a rack
I'm a gentleman, a gangster, and a motherfuckin' player
You's a square, I'm La Flare, yeah the Multi-Millionaire
Million here, million there I got millions everywhere
All these rappers are my kids so I got children everywhere
Wop

[Chorus]
These bitches wanna fuck when they see the 'Wop
The club be goin' up, when they see the 'Wop
We pilin' hoes in the truck, when they see the 'Wop
These niggas put they jewelry up when they see the 'Wop
You know some shooters on the bus, when you see the 'Wop
You know these girls start actin' up, when they see the 'Wop
You know these boys start actin' tough, when they see the 'Wop
The baddest bitches leave with us, when they see the Wop

[Verse 2]
Baby say she wanna come stand where the G's at
She gotta nose for it, she know where the cheese at
But all that attitude you brought you need to leave that
Fuckin' me's a privilege, I don't really need that
I can feed you bitch but I don't need the feedback
Just tryna chill and get some head and lean my seat back
Most of these niggas broke, I know you probably peeped that
But if I said I had ten mill' would you believe that
Think I'm the realest man alive I do believe that (its Gucci)
I'm leavin' Onyx with two hoes that dance at Magic
I drop my top in less than two seconds, it's magic
And if I don't make a mill' this month, then it's tragic

[Chorus]
These bitches wanna fuck when they see the 'Wop
The club be goin' up, when they see the 'Wop
We pilin' hoes in the truck, when they see the Wop
These niggas put they jewelry up when they see the Wop
You know some shooters on the bus, when you see the Wop
You know these girls start actin' up, when they see the Wop
You know these boys start actin' tough, when they see the Wop
The baddest bitches leave with us when they see the Wop

[Outro]
Fuck that nigga, look at this nigga wrist
Fuck that nigga, look at this nigga wrist
Fuck that nigga, look at this nigga wrist
I said fuck that nigga, look at this nigga, wrist
I think
Tonight
I wanna fight
My sweetheart's comin' down
One more smack on me
You'll see my
Knuckles start to bleed
I wanna stop
But I still need to
Get a swing
Baby
Baby
Baby
I think you're fine
You been on my mind
You're right on time
Just say you're mine

Tell me soon
You'll get the mood
And meet me down the block
If you go fast
It sure won't last
Kick my ass
The moment's passed
I might be out
But I should let you know
Baby
Baby
Baby
You think I'm strange
Maybe deranged
I'm not the same
But I love your game
Keep your body in the air
Shut your mouth, you stay up there

Don't let them see you like this
Wash your face and hide your wrist

Just like candy, you'll go down
Stain my teeth and rot my mouth

Paint by numbers, one by one
You will see and you will come

Keep the water inside you
You will speak when spoken to

Just like candy, you'll go down
Stain my teeth and rot my mouth
Let me show you everything I know

Alright come close
Let me show you everything I know
The jungle slang
Spinning around my head and I stare
While my naked fool
Fresh out of an icky gooey womb
A woozy womb
Dope so good, a silky smooth perfume

Ride my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance
Wanna sip this smooth air, kick it in the sand
I'd say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes
(x2)

My my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy smirk
I can't take this place, I can't take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space
(x2)

[Verse]
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you, you

[Outro]
I'm reaching out to you
I'm reaching out to you
I'm reaching out to you
I'm reaching out to you…
To  you, to you…
I'm reaching out to you
I'm reaching out to you
I'm reaching out to you…

This is wrong
This is right
Why don't you understand?
You fight
Clean that mess
Wear that dress
I want you to be happy
I guess

When I go, you'll know
By my footprints in the snow
Mama says "where'd you go?"
Daddy says "where'd you go?"
Baby says "don't you go"

She says
Rules are rules
Made for fools
And you are no exception
We're tools
I won't believe
Hate my need
To be a little part of
A machine
Don't you dare ask why
I'll be with you all the time
Mama says "close your eyes"
Daddy says "close your eyes"
But baby don't close her eyes
Bouncing on the bed, you choked
Something else you said, it woke
Me up

She stopped
To talk
I looked
For you

Purple in your arm looks good
Maybe I'll kiss the ceiling, I think
Of you

(It takes a plan from hell to do this well
It takes a plan from hell to do this well)

Stay here with me
It's what you need

Be my, be my daddy tonight

[Intro: Sevyn Streeter]
Seems like your heart stops working
The minute they close the curtain
You take off your mask
And take off your costume
And if anyone asks you're taking a smoke break
Drinking some coffee
But everyone knows what you're doing
Seems like the bus moves slower
Just cause you got somewhere to go
So you take a few pills in Beverly Hills
But if anyone asks you've got a prescription
You got an addiction
Who do you think that you're fooling?

[Hook: Sevyn Streeter]
John Doe, I just want the John I know
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home
John Doe, ooh oh oh oooh
Oooh oh oh ohooh oooh
Oooh oh oh ohooh oooh

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Errybody's addicted to something
Errybody's got to grip onto something
Even if it's just to feel the response of appeal
Maybe once, maybe twice
Maybe hundreds of times, hundreds of times
Without it, it's just harder to function at times
You race to the bottom of every single bottle
As if there was someone or something to find
You're struggling in your mind
And you tell yourself lie after lie
'Til you get to the point where it's no longer private
People that you work with noticed the signs
When you walk in the room
It gets noticeably quiet
So you break up the silence, you say you've been at the gym
But the way that you look, you can't blame on the diet
So what you hiding?

[Hook: Sevyn Streeter]
John Doe, I just want the John I know
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home
John Doe, ooh oh oh oooh
Oooh oh oh ohooh oooh
Oooh oh oh ohooh oooh

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Yeah, I've probably had too many things
Smashed too many freaks
Had too much to dro...(I mean)
Had too much to drink
Left the club, ended up in custody
Random drug test, passed it luckily
My girl broke up with me cause she walked in suddenly
With a woman up under me
I told her "Wait!
It ain't what it look like!
I must've slip and fell, clumsy me!"
Well, at least I admit it, cause the worst you could do
Is to do it and not be man enough to say that you did it
That's just how you prevent it, well I ain't no different
I love all the money, the fame
And the parties with beautiful women
I'd spent so much time as an underground artist
Cause I was afraid to succumb to the business
And what I'd become
But that what you'd judge I become
The path with the greatest resistance
That's how the tables can turn, when they pivot
And change your perspective and flip your entire position
My whole life I've been dying to wish and to live and experience
Everything possible
When I told them my dreams, they just said they ain't logical
Now, I can see it - it's optical

[Hook: Sevyn Streeter]
John Doe, I just want the John I know
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home
John Doe, ooh oh oh oooh
Oooh oh oh ohooh oooh
Oooh oh oh ohooh oooh

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]

Kurupt come here again

[Verse 7: Kurupt]
Hey, another day for me to get raw

I figure bigger niggas gotta reason to a trigger

[Verse 8: Snoop Dogg]
Now I was strolling through the park one day

They say Snoop Doggy Dogg is that you?
I say hell fucking yeah, you know I'm sporting through in grey

She staying around a corner, hey

It's in my living room and we got the Ozone
On some fat ass chronic and some fat ass dicks
So all we wanna see is assholes and tits
Jiggling and shaking, breaking taking off your clothes cuz'
We don't love them hoes

[Verse 1: Sam Smith]
I'm feeling something, something different
When you left, my picture changed
I was blinded, I'd not envisioned
The same face in a different frame

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Smith]
It's an omen, caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me, without you I am lonely
(lonely, lonely)

I've been
Envisioned
I've been
Envisioned
Envisioned
I've been
Envisioned
I've been

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen

[Refrain: Sam Smith]
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh
Envisioned
(Wonder why)
Envisioned
Saw the...
Envisioned
(Wonder why)
Envisioned
Saw the...

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen
My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen

[Outro: Sam Smith]
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh
Envisioned
(Wonder why)
Envisioned
Saw the...
Envisioned
(Wonder why)
Envisioned
Saw the...

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Smith]
It's an omen, caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me, without you I am lonely

[Woman in audience]
I love you!

[Bo]
No, you fucking don't.
You do not.
Haters gonna hate, lovers gonna love. You need to reject both sides of the spectrum to leave a... healthy middle.

[Woman in audience]
I love the idea of you!

[Bo]
Stop participating. Not a participatory thing going on up here. Trying to immortalize something I've worked on for a long time. Shut up!

I have not... made my mind up... about... masturbation. It's weird and I'm torn. You know, 'cause on one hand it feels good.

[Talking: Bo Burnham & (Audience)]
White guys, it's easy to be a white guy (Yeah!)
Yeah, white guy! We deserve a cheer once in a while
Very easy to be a white guy, very easy
But white guys get a lot of shit, and it's not fair, 'cause we've done a lot of things, ya know?
We invented a lot of stuff
White guys invented... everything but peanut butter, I believe. That's what I was taught in school, everything but peanut butter. Doesn't sound right, but the American educational system having a racial bias? No way, Joseph.

Guys, white... white people a little uncomfortable
We'll do a racial joke about the white people so you don't feel uncomfortable
White people, we like the same foods
Uh, favorite sandwich: peanut butter and (jelly) jelly
Macaroni and (cheese)
Our favorite chips: salt and vi-- (negar)
Wow! Who said it? Get the cameras on them
Your grandkids are gonna see this, know what a bigot their grandfather or grandmother were
Every non-white person, see who said that, find them after the show
Put the lights down; their faces creep me out

Guys, I'm not perfect. Okay? I don't "use air quotes correctly."
Alright? But I am against double standards across the board
Why is it that when a woman wears revealing clothing, she's labeled a slut, yet if I were to wear her skin as a jacket, I'm a murderer
Why--If I fuck a kid, I'm a pedophile, but if a kid fucks me, I'm a pedophile again? Twice in a week? What is this?

[Bo Burnham & High-pitched, pre-recorded voice]
Hey, Bo. You wanna sing a song with us?
Okay
Great!
I don't know the words, though
That's alright. You'll figure it out
Alright, woo!
Hey, Bo, guess what...
What?
You're a faggot

[Audience Laughs]
Wasn't clever, it was just mean. Bigoted, I apologize for that. So I was interrupted the other day, while--
Hey, Bo
Motherfucker!
Wanna sing another song together?
I really don't
Too bad
Goddamnit
Hey, Bo, guess what...
I'm a faggot
Correct
It's not funny
You're a faggot, you're a faggot, you're a fucking faggot
You're a faggot, you're a fucking faggot
Can you turn the lights off, at least?
You're a faggot, you're a faggot, you're a fucking faggot
Is this funny to you people?
You're a faggot, you're a fucking faggot
Turn it off. Turn the track off

[Record needle scratching sound effect]
Why was it on a record player? You got a record player back there?
You have hooked up a record player?
You know, it's one thing to make that, but to press it onto vinyl is a whole other thing, alright? It's gonna outlive me
Just to be clear, I wrote, conceived, and executed the entirety of that bit. Do not give those dumb fucks any credit
It's all me, baby, all me
Look at you people in the Abe Lincoln seats. Bam! Too late. Too late. How dare he make that joke so late
It's dark and its cold, but you're still lovely
And I'm getting old, and more untrusting

Take me for a ride, I won't let you down baby
I'll be right by your side, even though you're crazy
Anyone watch Celebrity Lip Syncing on The Tonight Show?

It's the end of culture. Culture's over, everybody. We lost. This is entertainment. How is this entertainment? People we've seen too much of mouthing along to songs we've heard too much of. And this is the bread and butter of American television. And it's always one of two things on celebrity lip-syncing. It's either a male celebrity lip-syncing to a woman's song...

[fake laugh] "But he's not..."

...Or it's a rich, young, white actress ironically lip-syncing to a hip-hop song.

"

[fake laugh] Fuck the police coming straight from the underground. Can you believe this song was once an honest articulation of class struggle? 

[fake laugh]"

Fuck these people. How dare they think that them fucking around is worthy of your attention? Them playing Pictionary? Your attention's a valuable thing. I worked for three years to get it for an hour. And I barely get there.

[silence]

See?

[audience laughter]
(Intense Instrumental Music)
(Fart noise)

Original does not mean good. Anyone can do anything. Don't let me off the hook too easy.

War, huh, good God y'all, what is it good for? Increasing domestic manufacturing. I don't want to get political 'cause I only know my own ideas of other people's ideas.

We just played in Alabama. They just like the lights. I didn't even need to do jokes. "Motherfucker's got moving candles." No, not quite. Alabama was actually nice. You're elitist pricks. Isn't that fun?
Do you guys know what continuity errors are? It's where in one shot something's one way, and in another shot it's another way.You know those things? Anyway.

[Bo Burnham & Pre-Recorded Voice]
This comedy performance is brought to you in part by...
Sorry about this.
Flamin' Hot Cheetos

[rock music playing]
Flamin Hot Cheetos! They're like regular Cheetos, but they're flaming' hot! Normal Cheetos are for pussies! But Flamin' Cheetos are not! For pussies that is!
They're not sponsoring me, I'm just trying to get them to. They're not returning my calls. "Evasively cheesy" is more like it.
Mmm, label-less water. Nothing tastes better than not getting sued.

I, uh... I don't love my fans. I have to be... I don't. You don't want that. You don't want that desperate, sort of cloying thing from an entertainer. "My fans, oh, they stick with me through everything, through thick and thin." Do not stick with me through thick. If I stop entertaining you, throw me to the curb. You wouldn't stick with your mechanic if he stopped fixing your car. I'm in a service industry. I'm just overpaid, okay? I feel a lot of artists, pop artists especially, sort of infringe upon responsibilities that just aren't theirs, in terms of their audience, maintaining their audience at an emotional level. Some of you might be sad, and going through things. I feel for that, life is tough. I'm not gonna fix that with a song. Like "Brave" or "Roar," you know these inspirat-- What I'm trying to say is don't listen to a song... like this.

[Hook]
I hit that, I hit that
I can’t even lie, I drilled that pussy
I can’t even lie, I ditched that pussy
Take this $500 and let me get that pussy

I hit that, I hit that
I can’t even lie, I drilled that pussy
I can’t even lie, I ditched that pussy
Take this $500 and let me get that pussy

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
You gonna take this $500 and let me get that thing
I can’t even lie I can’t resist that frame
The way she ride a dick is a goddamn shame
And the way she suck a dick I can’t forget that brain
It’s a real good day, make six good plays
Kept her at the mansion like six whole days
I’m not no kid and I sure don’t play
But my money’s standing taller than a high top fade
I’m looking oh so Dapper Dan in these brand new Js
Multimillionaire with all these goddamn waves?
Tried to charge me 500, baby that’s chump change
And your boyfriend is a lame, I’m a goddamn train

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
If I had a quarter for all the whores I hit
I’d be like Bill Gates, top of the Fortune list
I heard your girlfriend cheated on you, that’s unfortunate
And she prayed the soul, the baby, y’all aborted it
I hit like five dimes but I ain’t keepin’ score with it
And that was yesterday, I’m ballin’ like a Patriot
I give her dirt, you say you’re drinking ‘cause I paid for it
But I’m so rich, bitch, that it ain’t really cost me shit
They let the boss in this bitch, I’m spillin’ sauce ’n' shit
I’m Mr. Forbes list bitch, I got a costly dick
Your baby momma in the booth suckin’ sausages
I’m gettin’ my dick sucked in my office sippin’ coffee, bitch ('sgucci!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
She got a lot, she gettin’ paid
Bust it open, watch her work the stage
Slidin’ down the pole like she’s finna for the fire
You smoke her out, I get the bitch higher
Hotties clappin’ that ass for cash
Bitch nigga I’m throwin’ bags
Poppin’ bottles, throwin’ dollars
Gin down the throat, make that bitch swallow
Make her twerk while I’m puffin' purp'
She gon’ make your pockets hurt
Dance so freaky, I like it raw
But Juciy J ain’t Dirt McGirt
This look like the Player’s Club
Plus they all be showing love
VIP with the ratchet bitches
Shakin’ ass, off the drugs (mollies!)
They love me in the club
‘cause they know I’m tippin’
She might leave with a coupe
That’s just how I’m feelin’
Real street nigga
I’mma let her hit my weed
Take her to my hotel
And put her on her knees

[Hook]

Piped up in the city, send a hundred rounds

Chopper bang like a gang sign
Lotta money coming and you know I'm getting it all the time
Badass bitch with some thick thighs
Yellow bone bitch with some red eyes

Smoking on dope, man and I'm serving packs
Posted in the trap with that 100 round strap

Bitch I'm in this foreign going special ed
You can catch these shells, while I catch the bread

Hit the bank now
With the re-up deal, smoking weed your honor
Bang bang, bang bang
What you smoking on? You ain't smoking loud nigga
Got a fat chopper, shoot it at the crowd nigga
Enough weed on me to pass around nigga
Yeah I'm a Yung Joc cause it's going down nigga
Cops pull me over, I was full of smoke, woah
Ask me if I'm drunk and I said, oh no
I'm from the streets I don't rock with popos
I got my own going if you want smoke

Good things

[Chorus]
If you'd care for me, my baby

Oh, oh, so long
Waves so far up
Good things don't last

Good things, good
Richer or poor

Last or first
Hungry or thirst
Sad things
Sad news
Good things to do
Nothing for you

Can't change or change you
You can't let it
You can't rearrange you
You can't let it
Heart made of stone
Love made of glass
Love turning cold
Good things don't last
We had a good thing
It's good, it's good, uh
We had a good thing, no, no, no

Each night before you go to bed my baby
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby
And tell—hard for me baby
And the darkest hour is just before dawn
Each night before you go to bed my baby
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby

CUTS TO: EXT. PARTY - NIGHT
Drake and his girl are shown dancing in the middle of the party as people dance with boxes, brooms and other objects. The image cuts to Drake's girl walking into the party only to be stopped by a sinister man

SINISTER MAN: I'd like to discuss something with you. One million dollar.

DRAKE'S GIRL: He say that if I want to sleep with his boss for one million dollar. And I was like "you're crazy man."

DRAKE: You should do it.

DRAKE'S GIRL: What?

DRAKE: You should do it, that's easy. One night, one million dollars. (Drake starts kissing his girl) Huh? That's an easy ting.

[Music from "One Dance"]

Good luck
Get him out of my city

(hol' up)

hahahahahaha

[Music from "Summer's Over Interlude"]

[Verse 1]
Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play?
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
They slowly fade away

[Pre-Chorus]
So I start a revolution from my bed
Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

[Chorus]
And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
I heard you say

[Verse 2]
Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock'n'roll band
Who'll throw it all away

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, the summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

[Chorus]
And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
I heard you say

[Chorus]
So, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
I heard you say
So, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
Don't look back in anger
I heard you say

[Outro]
At least not today
I wanna love ya

I wanna love you
And treat you right
I wanna love you
Every day and every night

I wanna love you
And treat you right
I wanna love you
Every day and every night

We'll be together
With a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter
Of my single bed
We'll share the same room

Is this love
Is this love
Is this love
Is this love that I'm feeling?
I wanna love you
And treat you right
I wanna love you
Every day and every night

We'll be together
With a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter
Of my single bed
We'll share the same room

Is this love
Is this love
Is this love
Is this love that I'm feeling?

Is this love
Is this love
Is this love
Is this love that I'm feeling?

I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know now!

Is this love

Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reaching out

I say your name but you're not around

I need you, I need you, I need you right now

[Intro]
Wee-ooo, wee-ooo, wee-ooo, wee-ooo, wee-ooo
Oh, wee-ooo, oh wee-ooo

[Verse 1]
Hmmm, of course we all have times when we're weak
Where you can not find the version of yourself you seek
You should dig deep
Hmmm, don't go through extremes, hmmm
Oh baby don't get so down, oh baby don't get so down
Now that you know, now that you know
Hmmm, here's what you do, you gotta dig deep, deep
Oh to find your truth, your truth will speak, speak to you

[Chorus]
I'ma sew these wounds, I-I'ma sew these wounds myself
I'ma sew these wounds, I'ma sew these wounds myself
Hmmm, hmmm

[Verse 2]
We all have times when we weep
It's a troubled life, traumatized psychologically
I pray, in the shadows when I'm speakin' to no one
Myself, did everything right, didn't I?
So why aren't I whole?
You know you better dig deeper
Don't lie to you
You better dig deep, deep

[Chorus]
I'ma sew these wounds, I-I'ma sew these wounds myself
I'ma sew these wounds, I'ma sew these wounds myself
Hmmm, hmmm

[Outro]
I'ma sew these wounds
(I, I, I, I....)

Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light
Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Born from dusk to dawn, I am truly alive
The satellite that sits in frame to illuminate this shaded place
He's a rose that don't belong, the music, the magic, take the lead
Come on with it, mmm, come on

[Pre-Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Moments don't pass me up, no, no
'Cause I seize them in stride
Tell them winnin' never gave me in
When I eternally have faith
In the choices you made, it's all by design
Go with it, mmmm
Come on, don't fuck up the feng shui
Feng shui, feng shui, feng shui, feng shui

[Chorus: André 3000]
I see everything with new beams, I do dream
My eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring
Stop dueling with the true thing, I do think
When you think too much you're removing what's moving
Stuck inside a statue, look at you
Go ahead and pogo, something gon' catch you
A petty logo, shed all my tattoos
I read all the bad news that says I'm too careful

[Refrain: Kid Cudi]
Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light
Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
The universe never steered me wrong
The universe never lied
Take me bound to the come me down
The fantasy in this remedy
Free from where you don't belong in the concept of time
New levels, mmm, come on

[Pre-Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Moments don't pass me up, no, no
'Cause I seize them in stride
Tell them winnin' never gave me in
When I eternally have faith
In the choices you made, it's all by design
Go with it, mmmm
Come on, don't fuck up the feng shui

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
So twisted in emotional notions, oh yeah
I savor your love, don't fuck up the feng shui

[Chorus: André 3000]
I see every thing with new beams, I do dream
My eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring
Stop dueling with the true thing, I do think

Stuck inside a statue, look at you
Go ahead and pogo, something gon' catch you
A petty logo, shed all my tattoos
I read all the bad news that says I'm too careful

[Refrain: Kid Cudi]
Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light
Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi & André 3000]
Feel I'm being tested every minute
Feel like yesterday I was blind, I've been lost
Seems like I've stumbled on a path, no coincidence
Truly in my essence, I've arrived
Who am I? Who am I? Don't remind me
Too alive, too alive, new arriving
You were right, I was left in it before
To the light, to the light, I am Carol Anne
Parallel to paradise
I reach out for my lifeline
The angels laugh in paradise
They say I am my own lifeline, look in you
To the night, to the night I'm abandoned
To deny, to deny, what a sandpit
Couldn't I, couldn't I have an angel?
To the light, to the light, I am Carol Anne

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
So twisted in emotional notions, oh yeah
I savor your love, don't fuck up the feng shui

[Chorus: André 3000]
I see every thing with new beams, I do dream
My eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring
Stop dueling with the true thing, I do think

Hey you, so tell me, what's the low down? (Uh, say what?)
What's the hassle, tell me what's the low down? (Uh, say what?)
Come on, I know you're sexy, come on, let's take off
The seance, it's no cost to get lost and be found in the sound
I came through to throw down (Uh, say what?)
I ask who came for the show down (Uh, say what?)
Yeah, so exclusive, I don't mean to be a loser
Just go on let your hair down
Let down little hunny, she cuttin' to it, through it, through it
I'm on now, come on, knew it, knew it, knew it
Seem to be strange, now I'm barricaded in women
That's a given, I'm in heaven on Mars so you're now
Head over heels when I slide in them (Yes)

Really love the good in this bitch (Yes)

[Outro: Kid Cudi]

I does it, does it, does it, does it
Does it, does it does it
Does it
Tell me what else can I say
I'm feelin' okay, without the devil on my case today, aye
I does it, does it, does it

Boom boom, Boom boom

[Intro: Kid Cudi]
Ain't the type to let you tell her what she needs
Ain't gon' sit or stand around
A lethal love, I leave 'em sick, mamacita on me
No, one touch is never allowed
She said, "What do you want, what do you want, what do you want?
What do you want, what do you want, what you want, what do you want, what do you want?
What do you want, what do you want, what do you want, what do you want, what do you want?
What do you want, what do you...?"

[Chorus: Kid Cudi and André 3000]
Ooh, ooh
Where you going?
Where you going? (Yeah)
Where you going? (Are you sure? Alright)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
I need a winnin' woman, a Wonder Woman
A Gal Gadot, sophisticated and hot (Uh)
She knowing what she doing, like the music here
When she step on the scene she could light up the block (Uh)
Sittin' all, took her, make her awesome
Civil hearts hid them whole love back in a custom
Ain't too many women, I know
Who could look at your soul, just from lookin' at you
I heard she got these niggas fallin' at her feet
She kneels to no one with her golden crown
You'd be the one to b-bow
You'd be the one to b-bow
Have mercy on me, put some magic on me
Be my guide in the dark (Uh)
Have mercy on me, put some magic on me
Be my guide in the dark, guide in the dark

[Chorus: Kid Cudi and Andre 3000]
Ooh, ooh
Where you going?
Where you going? Yeah
Where you going?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: André 3000]
So when did we become so sophisticated and smart
And tryin' so hard that we forgot that we were animals?
But never her, I never heard a creature make such sounds
It never would occur to people her up-downs
Convertible, would murder evil, pup-pup hounds, just been doggin' her
Courtesy and real love found, just been dodgin' her
Mr. Man, misogyny hands been massagin' her
If she ran and blew up her town, shit, I would pardon her
Put a part in her scalp, scratch her dandruff
Put her heart in your hand, she throw a tantrum
Better let her get that shit off, bug repellent
Hell, they've been telling her "Nah" since forever
Harold Melvin and some Blue Notes all she know
Murder, murder, murder, m-murder all she wrote
Perverted, she prefer to be hurted, claw her throat
All the dirty verdicts she learned watchin' soaps, yeah

[Chorus: Kid Cudi and André 3000]
Ooh, ooh
Where you going?
Where you going? (Yeah)
Where you going?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
Semi-automatic with the passion when we makin' love
Never made it to the bed, sexin' on the living room floor
Now she on the warpath, homie probably best that you don't piss her off
Got this woman on the prowl, on the hunt, she gon' eat 'em all
And she know what she lookin' for, know what she lookin' for
She said she got herself some Louboutins, got herself some Louboutins
Not indecisive, indecisive at all
She know what she lookin' for, got her some Louboutins

[Chorus: Kid Cudi and André 3000]
Ooh, ooh
Where you going?
Where you going? (Yeah)
Where you going?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Refrain: Kid Cudi]
Hmm, you wanna find somebody you trust and lay low
But it seems they all on the same mission
You wanna find somebody you trust and lay low
But can't stand the heat of my love, then stay out the kitchen
You wanna find somebody you trust and lay low
But it seems they all on the same mission
You wanna find somebody you trust and lay low
But can't stand the heat of my love, then stay out the kitchen

You got me, got me

[Verse: Kid Cudi]
Hmm, baby here we are, I made a wish on a shootin' star
Hmm, I ain't even mad at it, we made it this far
Hmm, baby here we are, I made a wish on a shootin' star
Hmm, I ain't even mad at it, we journeyed so far
Hmm, baby here we are, I made a wish on a shootin' star
Hmm, it would be so tragic if, we abandoned this bond, no
Mhmm, baby, we've journeyed too far, no U-turns my sweetheart

[Pre-Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Hmm, hmm, mi amour
Hmm, yeah, hmm, mi amour, hmm

Part 1: Faithful

[Intro: Pimp C, Drake and Amber Rose]
Check, 1-2, 1-2, bitch
You expensive, you know that?
I'm high maintenance a little bit but not in a
Not in a negative way
I just like extremely expensive things

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Foot off in their ass is what Ken told me
Niggas like to play games cause they feel like they know me (they know me)
You don't know me, nigga, I done changed (I done changed)

This ain't no motherfucking '91
We out here rapping for money you niggas rapping for fun
I don't fuck with nobody in this shit but Bun
(in this shit but Bun)

[Pre-Hook: Drake]
You would think it's all mine the way I took it
You would think it broke down the way I push it
You hate it when I coat things all in sugar
You want to hear the real talk, well, girl, who wouldn't?

[Hook: Drake]
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful

[Verse 2: Drake]
You hit me like “I know you’re there with someone else"
That pussy knows me better than I know myself
On my way from the studio so get undressed
Let's do the things that we say on text
I want to get straight to the climax (straight straight to the)
Have you coming all summer like a season pass
I want to turn you out like pitch black
Want to watch you do work while I sit back
Cause you talk like you got what I need
You talk like you got the juice and the squeeze
Talk like you bet it all on me
And you can’t take no L’s off me
I know you been...

[Hook: Drake]
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful

[Verse 3: dvsn]
How far we go
Always seems to get better with time
Won't you, outsmart me
Told me that your brain works better than mine
Tell me I should know you
I got to know you again
You want me to show you
I'm gonna show you again
Now we're in the zone
Gon' let me all in again
And now you're coming over
Over and over and over and over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Now you're coming over
Over and over again
Over and over again
You tell me I should know you
But I'll get to know you again
And you want me to show you
I'm gonna show you again
When were in the zone you
Gon' let me own it again
And now you're coming over
Over and over and over and over and over again
Now you're coming over
You're coming over

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 4: dvsn]
I wet all the floors of your ego
Feel like I was slipping away
And you know that I ain't gonna go, ain't gonna go nowhere, nowhere
Cause some of these things never change, no, no
I know that you know, that you know, you know that's it's true
There's a lot on my mind and you bother the times that I matter with you
But we keep it way more way more than, way more than 100, we keep it 110
Show me what I gotta do

[Hook: Drake & dvsn]
I know you been working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful

[Bridge: dvsn]
And before you leave here (I need you to cum)
And until you do babe (don't you leave)
Ain't about me no more (need you to know)
Tonight I'll make sure (you cum before me)
And before you leave here (I need you to cum)
But before you do (don't you leave)
It ain't about me no more (need you to know)
Make that sure you (cum before me)

Part 2: Make Sure

[Verse 5: dvsn]
Get you on top of me
We can do this still properly
Get your hands in the air, do your hair back
You're like a winning ticket off the lottery
But you don't, yeah, you don't want to start on me
Yeah, you don't want to start with me
But you should, keep shaking that in front of me
Unless you're down to do this publicly
You know, you know you gon' get comfortable
On the 

[?] rug with me
And I fuck with you
So if you really fuck with me
Get as freaky as you wanna be, girl it's up to you
And she hit me with that "I don't do this normally, but for you I'll make exceptions"
Let's see what's next then
And it makes so much sense now (I need you to cum)
Girl it makes so much sense now (told you to leave)
You know that I'm gon' make sure now (need you to know)
Make sure, make sure  (cum before me)
Make sure, make sure (I need you to cum)
Make sure, make sure (told you to leave)
You know I gotta make sure, gotta make sure (need you to know)
Make sure, make sure  (cum before me)

[Chorus]
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away

[Verse 1]
Damage control
The same old tricks won't work no more
Smarter, stronger, hmmm
A nigga gon' make it through
What is to do, I've been low enough
Who knew I'd make it out?
Been trapped for too long, I'm out of the web

[Chorus]
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
Ey, yeah

[Verse 2]
Calls from the dark
I got hope in my eyes
No help in sight
I'ma swim in the light
She's tryna pull me in
But the same old tricks can't work no more
I'm out on the way

[Chorus]
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
Ey, yeah

Around the age of 23 (Let's go)

And I've been tuned in the line of grace
Livin' an electric dream (Electric dream)
Trippin' in the warmth of the love all around me
I'm trippin' in the warmth of the sun

Two, three, four
Ohhh-oh-ohh

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Willow Smith]
Oh, since I was young, been grooving to my own drum
Ain't that many teachers show me my potential
Felt like a failure, Mama said, "You know better"
Future in my hands, God, she had a plan
Stronger than I know, soon I'd understand
The power I possess, the story of the Chosen
Oh, since I was young, been grooving to my own drum
Ain't that many teachers show me my potential
Felt like a failure, Mama said, "You know better"
Future in my hands, God, she had a plan
Stronger than I know, soon I'd understand
The power I possess, the story of The Chosen

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
Hmm, hey
Hmm, hmm, na-na-na-na-na-nah
The story of The Chosen, Rose Golden
Mmm, mmm

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi & Willow Smith]
Looking where we're at
How did we make it through this level all in one piece?
Hmm, oh, oh
Oh, where them friends now? I don't see 'em
And if I do, I don't sense the truth in 'em
Distancing myself while I'm focusing, fo-focusing
Don't pretend to worry bout shit
Go through one ear and out the other
Better off saying nothing, nigga
As I shine on and dream on, our vibes are on
Had one trip of a dream back in 2003
Who am I? And who will I be? Will I be free?
I need a sign, oh I need a sign

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Willow Smith]
Oh, since I was young, been grooving to my own drum
Ain't that many teachers show me my potential
Felt like a failure, Mama said, "You know better"
Future in my hands, God, she had a plan
Stronger than I know, soon I'd understand
The power I possess, the story of The Chosen

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
Hmm, hey
Hmm, hey, na-na-na-na-na-na
The story of The Chosen, Rose Golden
Mmm, mmm

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi & (Willow Smith)]
Look at who you are, how could it be?
All I ever wanted was to find some inner peace
Mmm, oh, oh, oh
Where them haters now? I don't hear 'em
(They must be delusional) to think they fucking with me, though
I put that on my soul, can't love, they jealous, so jealous, and some
Learning day to day, humans
Spread love to all my sisters and brothers, let's do better
Stop judging a nigga because they're different
We're supposed to groove to our own tune
So woke from that one tripped out dream back in 2003
(Oh, who am I?)
And who do I see, baby?
The stars will align, the stars will align

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Willow Smith]
Oh, since I was young, been groovin' to my own drum
Ain't that many teachers show me my potential
Felt like a failure, Mama said, "You know better"
Future in my hands, God, she had a plan
Stronger than I know, soon I'd understand
The power I possess, the story of The Chosen
Oh, since I was young, been grooving to my own drum
Ain't that many teachers show me my potential
Felt like a failure, Mama said, "You know better"
Future in my hands, God, she had a plan
Stronger than I know, soon I'd understand
The power I possess, the story of The Chosen

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
Hmm, hey
Hmm, hey, na-na-na-na-na-nah
The story of The Chosen, Rose Golden
Hmm, na-na-na-na-na-nah
The story of The Chosen

[Verse 1]
You can depend on Cud Life to kill it
Having guillotine dreams with my enemies, oh
See 'em in the ditch, see 'em out, hit the exit
Can't stand to hear a bitch nigga mouth
I took a hook in the road to get in the mode, geronimo
Get in my jeans, white tee, and clean fitted
Hoes know me 'round the map, I can't hide the old summers
Hit the fuse and I lit it, the rest unfolds
Tell me how the fuck does he does it?
Levels unreachable, can't pin him to a mold
It's like a nigga been here before
Shit is a bore, my thoughts soar in the AM
Slay them like a machine round the clock
With the 12 gauge aim, telling Satan to fuck off
Hated the hand I was given
Tossed that shit back, like God must be kidding
And not for a nigga like me, not for the family
Not with a similar plans I just dumped
And I made me some choices, heard voices follow
No, can't stop a man with passion
These hoes don't distract a god, I am no clown
Grown man laying the stones all around in my throne
My kingdom, throwing from space
Fuck off expression on face, this is the case
I'm in place to be great, hmm
No fakes, raising the stakes
I'm in place to be great, hmm, hmm, hmm

[Bridge]
Uh, doing music, TV and movies
Sitting on the floors we ain't heard of
And the media wanna act like I ain't out here (I'm out here)
Running laps around these hoes (for years)
Running the game with no cheat codes (uh)
Unfuckwittable with two T's nigga, who else but Cud?
Give a motherfuck

[Chorus]
I does it, I, I, I does it and, I does it, yeah
I, I, I does it yeah, I, I does it yeah, oh, oh, oh
Nigga, I does it, yeah, oh, I, nigga, I does it, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, I does it, yeah, I does it, yeah, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Thought the kid dough cause I'm in a oven often
The kush in the lungs, a bushel of nugs
Awaken the dope, but they never dissolve the coke
Got the homies in the hood and they wanna rage on
Fast lane, pushing to the limit
Uh, enjoy the spoils, but don't bask in it
But see, I really wanna get me a farm and grow crop
Live with some girls who love me and this cock
The more I grow, the more I double in powers
Non-ambitious for cowards, trippy go for toe
Won't be a drone clone, half-hearted
Sheep in the herd, brainwashed at what cost
I'm a raise some hell, you know this
And if I piss people off along the way, bonus
Cause these niggas are stale chips
All around thinking they're fresh with the stale shit
And corny bitches need corny niggas, that's well fit
God has a plan for everybody but I'm it, Chosen
Scotty 'bout to even the mood, get lost in the tune
Forget it all, take flight my doves
Say we are the, we are the knights in the world
Listen baby can you see in the club, we gettin' bent up
The sun up, egg, cheese, sunny-side up
I'm waiting for you, and taking the cue
Having a drink, let's make it a few
Here's to you, you, you, and you
Salute, hmmm, I bid you adieu
Salute

[Bridge]
Uh, doing music, TV and movies
Sitting on the floors we ain't heard of
Uh, and the media wanna act like I ain't out here (I'm out here)
Running laps around these hoes
Winning the game, no cheat codes
Unfuckwittable with two T's nigga, who else but Cud?
Give a motherfuck

[Chorus]
I does it, I, I, I does it and, I does it yeah
I, I, I does it yeah, I, I does it yeah, oh, oh, oh
Nigga, I does it yeah, oh, I, nigga I does it yeah
Oh, oh, oh, I does it yeah, I does it yeah, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Since birth it was prophecy, the Cosmic Warrior
Surrounded by infinite light, surrounded by infinite light
Since birth it was prophecy, the Cosmic Warrior
Surrounded by infinite light, surrounded by infinite light

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
I took a swan dive
Need to say I'm okay
War all behind me
Metaphor for the life of mine
Searchin' far and wide
Never needed to, overdrive
Kept it close, no ends
Must have stayed true to who I am
I always knew, what to do

[Chorus]
'Cause since birth it was prophecy, the Cosmic Warrior
Surrounded by infinite light, surrounded by infinite light
Hmm, Since birth it was prophecy, the Cosmic Warrior
Cosmic Warrior, surrounded by infinite light
Surrounded by infinite light

[Bridge]
Legend goes
Legend goes

Drippin', drippin'
Ooh, I love to see that body wet
Hmm, don't be shy with it
Hard to trust anyone anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone
Yeah, you're a lot of fun, a lot of fun, a lot of fun, a lot of fun

[Intro]
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey, uh
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey, uh
You fronting for that new nigga and, and we know it, hmmm
You keep fronting for that new nigga and- and we know it
You blew it

[Verse 1]
Uh, I know you still think about me
I could tell he knows, he probably saudy
No more dodging this shit, the cat and mouse
Finding love in the shadows, ready to pounce
They yearning for my return
Laying next to him, you daydreaming of my meat
You remember when I said, "Put it on my face"?
Damn, girl, when will you learn? There's no escaping me
Passion never dissipates, no soul without your mate, relate
Man, I could've never fathomed
Hate you mingling with these corny niggas, though I don't care how it happened
It's cool now, 'cause I'm home
Sloppiest sex, the best way, we're both giving dome
Uh-uh, until the break of dawn
I gotta, getcha, getcha, getcha on, on
You know I'm the only one to get you revved up
Spread it open, pound it 'til it's numb, yum
In bed you would play a vision that's too thotty
Like, what's on your mind, babe?
One blink and you're caught lying

[Chorus]
Lying, lying entirely to everyone
Distant yearnings and fantasies
Keep lying, you keep lying entirely to everyone
There isn't another soul who knows your soul
Like I, quite like I, quite like I, quite like I
Yeah, quite like I, quite like I
(Quite like...)

[Verse 2]
"I'm so through with him," she says
"I hate her," he says
The makeup sex is electric
He smiles her gazes
Her sun on gray weeks
Translates her heartbeat
"My leg's shakin'," she says
He grabs the back of her neck
And they live a little, mmm
And they live a little
Give a little

[Chorus]
Lying, lying entirely to everyone
Distant yearnings and fantasies
Keep lying, you keep lying entirely to everyone
There isn't another soul who knows your soul
Like I, quite like I, quite like I, quite like I

[Refrain]
You fronting for that new nigga and, and we know it
Hmmm, hmmm-mmm-mmm-mmm

[Verse 3]
The curse of once dating an awesome nigga
Can't duck my energy, ever
Such a curse is a curse if you make it so
Which means we in control until forever
So stop wasting your fucking chi
Stop searching, chasing your tail
Running in circles to no destination
Remember we once saved each other from hell?
I'm never tryna persuade
You gotta figure what you want in you
I'll be clear, I'm a hell of a man
Flaws and all, somebody would love to have me, too
But you can tell I'm bored with these hoes
Sex is weak when there isn't a glow
Takes a man longer to see this fact
Women are quicker with this type of shit, we know
Uh, uh, show me the lane, dude
I'll be speeding down that bitch, I'm going straight to you
Uh, always knew you still thought about me
Now cut the doubt

[Chorus]
Lying, lying entirely to everyone
Distant yearnings and fantasies
Keep lying, you keep lying entirely to every one
There isn't another soul who knows your soul
Like I, quite like I, quite like I, quite like I
Yeah, quite like I, quite like I
(Quite like...)

[Intro]

Hmm, so far out
Hmm, I trust you
Hmm, I trusting, trust you, trust in me

[Verse]
In the moment, snappin' no pictures
Grown women, get on the floor,  phone in the purse
See, there are levels
Spirit I'm wanting, someone of a mature nature is in verse
In the moment, snappin' no pictures, grown women get on the floor, phone in the purse
See, there are levels
Spirit I'm wanting, someone of a mature nature who's in verse

[Verse 1]
There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

[Chorus 1]
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
Well, it's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far, oh love

[Chorus 2]
And can you feel the love tonight? (tonight)
How it's laid to rest, oh
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

[Verse 2]
There's a time for everyone, see,  if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
(There's a rhyme)
There's a rhyme and reason (to the wild)
To the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

[Chorus 1]
And can you feel the love tonight?(tonight)
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
This far, yeh

And can you feel (can you feel)
The love tonight? (the love tonight)
It is where we are, yeah
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far

[Chorus 2]
Can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest
Well it's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

[Verse 1]
I lit out from Reno
I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep last night 'till the morning came around

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 2]
Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 3]
I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 4]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie
And she's my hearts delight
The second one is prison, babe, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 1]
I couldn't speak so I slurred while I looked for a word
But you left just before I could find it
I sat by myself and I stared at the pictures of you on the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
I kissed the floor, curled up in a ball
There's nothing coming out of my mouth so I said nothing at all

[Chorus]
Babe, you've got a face like thunder
Always trying to get out with another
Just stay still 'til I say it's over
Babe, you've got a face like thunder

[Verse 2]
And you question your lover, did she really believe
That this new taste of love is obsolete? -
It just couldn't compete
And so you’ll keep dragging your body through life by the hair
So you can say that you've been somewhere
And you don't care for your receipt
You're sentenced to death and you can't be reprieved

[Chorus]
Babe, you've got a face like thunder
Always trying to get out with another
Just stay still 'til I say it's over
Babe, you've got a face like thunder

[Bridge]
Say sorry for a while, for a while, for a while
You know I didn't mean it
I said something terrible and I tried to redeem it
I can be so cruel although I don't seem it

[Chorus]
Babe, you've got a face like thunder
Always trying to get out with another
Just stay still 'til I say it's over
Babe, you've got a face like thunder
Wound up tight, I'll
Spend the night
I never wanna think again
I never wanna see it when
The kids on the carpet have to go their separate ways
The heartache that they're feelin' has been filling up the place
If you never drink the poison, then you're never gonna cry
If you don't believe in magic, then you shouldn't even try

You look nice, babe
Don't think twice, maybe
The world is a really scary place
But I know from the look that's on your face
Your life has been over way before it all began
If you don't want to be lonely, then I can be your man
I know that your mommy's getting underneath your skin
But girl, it's all a fuckin' joke, so just live it while you can

[Hook]
You know I’m a gangster
So danger’s not a stranger

And I’m dizzy when I’m anger

I‘ll put you in the paper
I’ll send you to your maker
Then retreat to Jamaica
It die down, I'll be back later

[Verse 1]
All gangsters toe strap to this
Pussies in the club get slapped to this
Sucka ass niggas don’t rock to this
And if you ain’t a real nigga don’t play my dis

I’m Gucci Mane LaFlare I’ll blast the bitch
Then put me on the stand I’mma plead the fifth
I’mma merc' this track here on the script
Studio gangsters, don’t rock with them

[Verse 2]
All the greatest (?) niggas move bricks to this

Rich squad niggas toe strap the shit
This rubber spit quotes (?) are not accurate

Gucci Mane swag immaculate

My enemy pussy (?) like Malcolm X
To get to the top I got to get
You get in my way, then your head I’ll hit
With a hollow tip, nigga, I hardly miss
Niggas diss me, but I don’t (?) to this
I’ll pistol whip a nigga till his skull is split —Gucci!

[Hook]

And I ain’t got hollow top lead, man?
Four shots all in your chest, man
Fuck around on that Cris', man

In my Phantom coupe just laughing
Me giving y’all a thought is the last thing

[Hook]
You know I’m a gangster

Burr!
When you're young
Yeah, you're a loaded gun
So, don't worry honey, you'll go right back
Where you started from
Benny saved, saved a spot for you
'Cause he knows you're comin' back, honey
'Cause you always come back
And you can't talk to him like that
'Cause he's gonna hurt you bad
Honey, I bet you my spot in hell
I don't know where it is you go
But I know he's going through your heart, honey
And straight to the house of god
I know you're still here and you wish you could feel it
I see you on a big screen and you're lookin' sick to your stomach

Look at you
You look so confused
And I remember when you complained about being alone
I could do anything to you
I could do anything for you
I could do anything to you
Do you miss me, you sad lady?
'Cause I'm really feeling down
And if you're feeling lonesome too
I'd like it if you came around
Do you miss what you thought you were
Back when you thought you knew what you are
Do you miss your favorite song
Back when you thought you knew what was wrong
Where you are
I don't care, I just wanna be a part
Of something
When I was sixteen, I was dead
I was sick from being underfed
When I was twelve, all I did was cry
I saw my favorite band burn alive
When I was ten, I hated you 'cause you hurt me
It was what you knew
Do you miss me, Stephanie
'Cause I'm really missing you

Where you are
I don't care, I just want to be a part of something

[Verse 1]
Haven't felt right in a week
And I'm thinning out
And it hurts bad
I gotta get back
Hot head and dreamless sleep
I could just slip down
And on the wrong track
I gotta get back

[Verse 2]
I wanna spend the entire year
Just face down
And on my own time
I wanna waste mine
And spend the rest of it asking myself
"Is this who you are?"
And I don't know
It just feels gross

[Bridge]
I don't think there's anything wrong
I don't think there's anything wrong
And I don't think there's anything wrong
I don't think there's anything wrong

[Outro]
Sunlight on the back of my arms
Just thins me out
To a different time
I wanna waste mine
I went down to the bottom of a great, great lake
And there's hundreds of mothers there waitin' for me
I saw the mistress and her mate, mate, mate
But there's hundreds of lovers inside her body
I went down to the bottom of the great, great lakes
And there's hundreds of mothers there to come and love me
I saw your reflection in my face so I scrubbed it all around until it erased

I went down to the bottom of the great, great lakes
And there's hundreds of mothers there waitin' for me
Thinking of things to do
Yeah, only the cheapest things
Left there for you
And the only thing
I learned from you
Is that there's nothing left
To look forward to, and
I was asleep for days
And now you're the only thing
Keeping me awake
The calculator will make
The same mistakes
Yeah, I see it in its face

Hold on tight to this time, this place
'Cause everything you know will be erased
You were born inside your head and
And that is where you'll be
When you are dead
You're just a boy
You are no man and
Nobody you know will understand
You're just a boy
You are no man and
Nobody you know will understand
Welcoming you back home
The only one that you have ever known
Welcoming you back home
The only one that you will ever know

Haaaaa haaaaaaaa haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Hold on tight to this time, this place
'Cause everything you know will be erased
You were born inside your head
And that is where you'll be
When you are dead
You're just a boy
You are no man
And nobody you know will understand
You're just a boy
You are no man
And nobody you know will understand

But lately you don't seem to care
You close the door
And leave me standing there
Oh, honey

That's it
I quit

The other night we had a date
And you showed up two hours late
And though your hair was all in place

Oh, they smeared it

You made me leave you
You made me tumble and fall
But if I can't have you the way I want you
I don't want you at all

[Verse 3]
Baby, I can take a lot
'Cause I love everything you got
Though your kisses fill me
So if you got someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
Yeah that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on

Oooohhhh

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Flock of birds
Hovering above
Just a flock of birds
It’s how you think of love

And I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
‘Cause they fly always
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
They fly on

Flock of birds
Hovering above
Into smoke I’m turned
And rise following them up

Still I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
‘Cause they fly away
One minute they arrive
Next you know they’re gone
They fly on
They fly on
Oh, so fly on
Ride through
Maybe one day I’ll fly next to you
Fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I can fly with you
Fly on
Fly on
Fly on

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
I will always love you how I do
Let go of a prayer for ya
Just a sweet word
The table is prepared for you

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
Wishing you godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
(Oh-oh-oh)
Still I'll always be there for you
(Oh-oh-oh)
How I do
I let go of my claim on you, it's a free world
You look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home, always

[Verse 2: dvsn]
God has my soul but you have my heart
Will string to the end, that's where we'll start
And it's a long way, you're lost
I lose myself, I found you
You're like kinda like I found you
Could you use that if I can't guide you
That to me, I'll be

[Hook: Frank Ocean & dvsn]
Wishing you godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
(Oh-oh-oh)
Still I'll always be there for you
(Oh-oh-oh)
How I do
I let go of my claim on you, it's a free world
You look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home, always

[Bridge: Frank Ocean & Kim Burrell]
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
Until it's time
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
It's 'til it's time we die
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind

[Outro: Kim Burrell]
Oh-oh, ohhh
I'll always love you
Until the time we die
Oh-oh, ohhh

[Verse 1: Slim Shady]

It's the Bushman with art in a dart
It’s six o clock sharp you hear them dogs startin to bark
And while they're carving a mark in ya arm, with teeth sharper than sharks
Im out in the parking lot stripping ya car for ya parts
Boy I was rhyming when you was mispronouncing my name
Like E-minem, now you look for my tapes and can’t find em
Back in the day I'da killed for some radio play
But now i’m with Dre, and I still don’t give a fuck either way
But ima trust Bush to give me a thrust and a push
While these other radio stations are busy playin’ puss
So look to the next man and if he ain’t clapping his hands
Throw him in the bush so fast he gets stabbed in his back with a branch
It’s 98 the one station that runs town
And two DJs rippin’ from sun up to sun down
From sun down to sun up
Slim shady still don’t give a thumbs down
With three fingers and keep the middle one up
It’s 98 WJLB
Watch in October for the Slim Shady LP

[Outro]
Bushman art in a dart
Bushman art in a dart

[Verse 1]
I know you're smart
You spin me round like a knot
You know the pieces, pieces of my heart
Sometimes its fun, you pull my strings one by one
Until you get me, get me, onto one

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough, then let's play rough
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough, then let's play rough
I don't need you, giving it straight to me, giving it straight to me
Just gonna get my back
I don't need you, telling me how to be, telling me how to be
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back

[Chorus]
Just noise, white noise
Just noise, white noise
I'm hearing static, you're like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying
Just noise, white noise
Just noise, white noise
I'm hearing static, you're like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying

[Verse 2]
Only you can look at me the way you do
You always tint me tint me black and blue
Such a shame, you frame me with such disdain
You got me washed out, washed out color drained

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough, then let's play rough
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough, then let's play rough
I don't need you, giving it straight to me, giving it straight to me
Just gonna get my back
I don't need you, telling me how to be, telling me how to be
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back

(All I need is
All I need is
All I need is
All I need is
All I need is

[Chorus]
Just noise, white noise
Just noise, white noise

You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying
(Hear me crying
Hear me crying)
Just noise

[Intro: Big Meech]
You already know who you are
You ain't trying to impress nobody
Who you got to impress?
You done came through the ranks
You've been tested, you know what I mean?
And you stood up
That mean you've been tested and you stood up
And you still standing up
So who you got to impress?
You ain't got to impress nobody, man
Be who you are, you know what I mean?
You should be yourself because I'm saying if you do shit, man, for other people, then you faking it
I don't need you to be no motherfucking gangster for me
I need you to be a man

[Chorus]
I got God watchin' over me from courtside
Ballin' like I'm Jordan 'cause I'm blessed up
And niggas want me gone, but I'm still alive
Wake up every morning feelin' blessed up
Pull up in that holy Ghost 'cause I'm blessed up
I'ma do the most 'cause I'm blessed up
Had to scoop my niggas out the hood
Now we all eatin' good like we should 'cause we blessed up

[Verse 1]
It's outstandin' that I'm still standin'
Macs get brandished when beef get sandwiched, blat, blat
Do it for my niggas that's scammin'
On the corner with it runnin' that tan ish
Duckin' the Ds, cut through the alley, scuffin' your trees
Tossin' the profit and fuck up your re
I know the feelin', nigga
Start from a dollar, couple of Gs
Bought an Impala, I'm flooding the streets
It's time to kill 'em, nigga
I got an eight flipped over and I'm dealin', nigga
In a drop S coupe and I'm wheelin', nigga
Five hundred for the piece how I'm feelin', nigga
In the hood just chillin', nigga
I've seen the realest niggas turn emotional, all in they feelin' niggas
That's why I ain't really feelin' niggas
And if them hoes fuck with rats I ain't sayin' nothin' to them bitches
I guess I ain't really for them bitches
Really, I'm blessed

[Chorus]
I got God watchin' over me from courtside
Ballin' like I'm Jordan 'cause I'm blessed up
And niggas want me gone but I'm still alive
Wake up every morning feelin' blessed up
Pull up in that holy Ghost 'cause I'm blessed up
I'ma do the most 'cause I'm blessed up
Had to scoop my niggas out the hood
Now we all eatin' good like we should 'cause we blessed up

[Verse 2]
Blessings, you niggas stressin'
Mac on the dresser when I'm dressin' and never pressure
Crab in the barrel, watch the bucket, don't let 'em catch you
'Cause if they pull you back to the bottom, know you gon' suffer, fuck 'em
I done leveled up on 'em to where I cannot touch 'em
Therefore, can't feel 'em
Therefore, I'ma hustle
New Wraith on Forgis
Course that's from the muscle
Course I got a bubble, new Porshce red like a devil
Go skrt skrt through the lane on you
Niggas broke and you faker than that chain on you
I told Tak when he see you, go insane on you
Can't D me, call it man, I clear the lane on you
Change the speed, game 7 'Bron James on you
My little niggas begging me to put that flame on you
You get some money, watch how all these niggas change on you
That's why I changed on 'em, I don't feel a thing for 'em
Nigga, I'm blessed

[Chorus]
I got God watchin' over me from courtside
Ballin' like I'm Jordan 'cause I'm blessed up
And niggas want me gone but I'm still alive
Wake up every morning feelin' blessed up
Pull up in that holy Ghost 'cause I'm blessed up
I'ma do the most 'cause I'm blessed up
Had to scoop my niggas out the hood
Now we all eatin' good like we should 'cause we blessed up

[Verse 1]
On the lam cut down in the middle of the night caught in a trap
Crushed by the crown of the wandering man who was never coming back
Stuck on the line spending all of his time with his back to the throne
With the flash of the round everybody in town said "Leave it alone"

[Chorus]
Just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
Your heart will never say so
Your heart will never let it go
Just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
My heart will never say so
My heart will never let it go

[Verse 2]
I got caught in the middle of a hurricane fight facing the ground
Beast of the wild with a porcelain smile as it passes around
The truth in disguise from the billowing eyes isn't working on me
Don't you think you gotta give
Give me something I want
Give me something I need

[Chorus]
Just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
Your heart will never say so
Your heart will never let it go
Just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
My heart will never say so
My heart will never let you go

[Chorus]
Just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
Your heart will never say so
Your heart will never let it go
Just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
My heart will never say so
My heart will never let you go

[Outro]
Just like the reverend, like the reverend on the radio
So my heart will never say so
And my heart will never let you go

[Intro]
Peace up! Ya'll know what it is
Yeah, man, BlackSox
It's Usher baby, yeah
Just a little warm up

[Verse 1]
I was out in the city of ATL, where we steady keep it popping
We got them Georgia peaches so sweet that you want to bite them
And we got the hardest slang that bang from every city
Does anybody know how to make it rain?
We keep that carpet green in the city, the saddle in the traffic
You ever got a problem, homie? We make you feel unstopped
Oh, no, yes, sir
So when you see me in the club, partner this is how you greet me, throw it up

[Hook]
I can make it rain 24 stacks in the air
It's raining money in here, throw it up, ah, throw it up, ah
You gotta get it on the floor, short
Get it in on the floor, shorty
Get down on your knees
I'm trying to get you all alone
So you can feel the chrome up in my Chevy drop top
This the part where everybody throw up the A

[Verse 2]
Aye, what it do, shorty? Let me get that number, shorty
What you see in the A, we shoulder lean and snap, shorty
We keep the hottest fit, fresh to death
Come in the club like we never left
If you ain't with it, shorty, get gone
(Yeah, I'm coming)

[Verse 1]
See you in the Western sky
On the best of nights
Out in the dark
You always seem to come my way
Come and take your shape
Out in the stars
I really wanna know your name
See your face
Know who you are, who you are

[Chorus]
How did ya find me
How did ya find me
What are you looking for, are you looking for
How did ya find me
How did ya find me
I see your shadow knocking at my door

[Verse 2]
Waiting on the smoke to rise from behind your eyes
Take me away
Follow me into the wild
With a twisted smile
I can't escape
And now I got you by my side
All my life
Day after day
Turn to gray

[Chorus]
How did ya find me
How did ya find me
What are you looking for, are you looking for
How did ya find me
How did ya find me
I feel your shadow knocking at my door

[Bridge]
See you in the western sky
Behind your eyes
I can't escape
From the gray

[Chorus]
How did ya find me
How did ya find me
What are you looking for, are you looking for
How did ya find me
How did ya find me
I feel your shadow
What are you looking for

[Outro]
How did ya find me
How did ya find me

[Intro]
Open up your books to the page of yes

[Verse 1]
Throw your hands up for that young nigga from way back, sporting the "A" hat
Spinning wheels, more fortunes than Pat Sajak
Hit the playback 'cause I'm stupid with it
Track hard like stone, you'd think Medusa did it
Please believe me, it's so easy
That cold Neptune shit is so for reazzy
I'm countin G-stacks, so tell 'em ease back
A hundred to spin, so cocksucker, beat that
Numerous bank rolls, don't get your face swolled
And tell your hombres I'm comin for they pesos
'Cause it's that snatch back, call us the Splack Pack
Broke your cousin, put your mama in a hatchback
And I ain't playing with you, I'm just praying wit you
Hoping that the fertilizer ain't laying wit you
You all grouped up, I caught a grouper
And slide off 'cause the Chevrolet swooped up

[Hook]
Fellas, it's a stick up, so lift up
Don't get it confused or mixed up
Come out your pockets or get flipped up
Shake them down, shake them down, shake them down, shake them
Ladies, it's a stick up, so lift up
Don't get it confused or mixed up
Come out your pockets or get flipped up
Shake them down, shake them down, shake them down, shake them

[Verse 2]
Somebody hurry up, please, and call an ambulance, I caused an avalnnche
With nuts so big, I walk around with Hammer pants
Raps will slap a man, make you do the Hammer dance
My basslines thump with more funk than Pakistan
Come from a vast block, I was a have-not
But now I keep at least a hundred in the stash box
I had a cash plot to get a fat knot
I threw my album in the slot and hit the jackpot
So, nigga, ching ching, I did the thing, thing
Four months later, my mama's like, "bling bling"
Just lke George and 'Ouise, I was moving up
And fuck a platinum plaque, I'm doing two and up
Not for the short chains, y'all shooting short range
But it was either rap limelight or court things
So I Just made do until it came through
Throughout the ups and downs, I still stayed true

[Hook]
Fellas, it's a stick up, so lift up
Don't get it confused or mixed up
Come out your pockets or get flipped up
Shake them down, shake them down, shake them down, shake them
Ladies, it's a stick up, so lift up
Don't get it confused or mixed up
Come out your pockets or get flipped up
Shake them down, shake them down, shake them down, shake them

[Verse 3]
All you weak rappers, wipe your feet off on my doormat and get your flow back
Or try to run and get traced down like LoJack
Down like four flats, you better know that
I take the four and put a zero on your throwback
That's how that thing go, you'll hear that thing blow
So hurry up and do like my dick, hang low
Got the perpetrators yelling, "Let the lame go!"
Up on your good foot or I'll shoot you in the same toe

[Hook]
Fellas, it's a stick up, so lift up
Don't get it confused or mixed up
Come out your pockets or get flipped up
Shake them down, shake them down, shake them down, shake them
Ladies, it's a stick up, so lift up
Don't get it confused or mixed up
Come out your pockets or get flipped up
Shake them down, shake them down, shake them down, shake them
My right hand partner
Used to work it for a living
He'd take the backseat
Of all that he was given

He'd let you rise
Then take the fall
He was my favorite friend of all

My old muchacho
Loved to dress for each occasion
Without that rocket ship
Taking me in the right direction
Those crooked eyes
That know it all
He was my favorite friend of all
He was my favorite friend of all

He's wearing jean on jean
Cut him some slack, fox
Perched in the corner of the scene
Just here to take stock
He'll take the chain
He'll take the ball
He was my favorite friend of all
He was my favorite friend of all
He was my favorite friend of all

[Verse 1]
Take me back to California
To those crystal neon signs
Where the traveling sensations
Are all blinded by the light

There are eyes in every corner
Bloated brains and rotten smiles
There are coats of many colors
Flying high up in the sky

[Chorus]
Won't you come 'round my way for some conversation, please?
Won't you come 'round my way, it's a conversation piece

[Verse 2]
Look at all these shattered faces
They all look so out of place
They've got nothing left to live for
They'll be dead before they wake
I'd love to know just what you're thinking
Tell me what I ought to do
I will never leave you lonely
You're the one I'm running to

[Bridge]
Get me out of California
Take me off into the blue
We could make it out together
To the place that's calling you

[Chorus]
Won't you come 'round my way for some conversation, please?
Won't you come 'round my way, it's a conversation piece

[Chorus]
Won't you come 'round my way for some conversation, please?
Won't you come 'round my way for some conversation, please?
Oh, won't you come 'round my way, it's a conversation piece

[Verse 1]
Out here looking for the good life
Tongue in my cheek and ya back in my knife
I keep pushing through
My eyes are right on you

Everyone says you should get away
Fast as you can, but I know you'll stay
You never fall behind
He's always on your mind

You're somewhere I wanna go
Nice and swift as we take it slow
Oh, we're on our way
Don't ever hesitate

I'll hide in the dark in the back of your brain
Laughing aloud as we go insane
No time to waste
I never come too late

[Chorus]
If you don't like it, then try it
You don't like it, then try it
Oh, I believe it when I see it
I believe it when I see it

[Verse 2]
You're my misfit and I'm your freak
Dance all night 'til our knees go weak
We can shut this place down
No one else is around

I try hard to understand
The crush of the world in the palm of your hand
You know we sit just right
Let's run away from the light

[Chorus]
If you don't like it, then try it
You don't like it, then try it
Well babe, I believe it when I see it
I believe it when I see it

[Verse 3]
Tongue in your cheek and back in my knife
Out here looking for the good life
Keep on pushing through
I got eyes on you
Baby, you know we're on our way
Misfit and freak every single day
Sitting ten feet tall
Let's go and take it all

[Chorus]
If you don't like it, then try it
You don't like it, then try it
I know you can see it, I believe it
You can see it, I believe it

[Outro]
We're here for the moment, so let's own it
For the moment, so let's own it
It's here for the taking
Why you waiting?
It's good loving, it's worth making

[Verse 1]
Like in a mainstream melody
Oh I want to take you in
If you come around
I come a running
Waltz through the fire again

The weight of the wind is kicking up
Every little sting is you
Plucked from the vine
Ahead of its time
Only if you want me to

[Chorus]
Wild heartbreak and wonder
Time, rolling like thunder
Brace for the explosion
Wild blissfully open

[Verse 2]
I spent the night on a riverside
Trying to recall my name
Head full of bends all sinking in
Something has it gone insane
The shape of the light comes screaming in
Harsh enough to see it through
Something in the air and the water tonight
Rising from the best of you

[Chorus]
Wild heartbreak and wonder
Time, rolling like thunder
Brace for the explosion
Wild blissfully open

[Chorus]
Wild heartbreak and wonder
Time, rolling like thunder
Brace for the explosion
Wild blissfully open

So icy jack boys, Gucci bandanas attached
Rich boy white and yellow, bigger than a tennis racket
Gave my dentist fifty racks, this gold grill; you can have it back

Old Jersey, red and yellow, you would think I was the coach
Red chain, white snow; it’s hard to feel me and my hoe
Red and white Mardi Gras; leather band, black Audemar
Green diamonds match my car; purple stone that match her heart

Damn Gucci Mane, ain’t fair; shorty say she fuck with me

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
Bitches say I'm photogenic, diamonds dancing on my pendant
Stirrin' like I’m cooking spinach, this gon take like 20 minutes
Ain’t got time so let it out, I'm the nigga that you read about
Beat the type of you pussy niggas I hate these lames a whole lot
I was taught not leave witness, every day I'm handling business
Pulling up in big old Benzes, yea my rims are real expensive
Just one verse but I said a lot
Rich Squad boys get bread a lot
Sit it out, or bring the titties out
Laid the top back in the city light

Got devious and trippin', all my niggs are like a waterfall

So holler at your boy without opening your mouth (Ya know)
'Cause that's the G-Code and that's all that I'm about
You die if you go against it, so I'ma live it out

[Intro: Priscilla Renea]
I been workin' all day, hmmm 'til the sun go down
Back hurt, feet hurt, but I still got to work
Who gonna save me? Hmmm, break every chain, hmmm
Take me away from this place and leave me away

[Hook: Priscilla Renea]
Runnin' like I know they comin' for me
I'm 'bout to spill enough blood to fill the red sea
Fear no evil, 'bout to set my people all free
If they crucify me, that's just what it's gon' be
Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Kill 'em all, that's the minimal, only way to fend 'em off
Leave 'em sittin' at death's door, proper way to send 'em off
They'll just beat me 'til the sin is off or my skin is off
Some tried to run, they got tracked down, now our limit's off
I'm just tryna find the North, let the stars design the course
Hope the mud can hide my scent, pray the night can slow they horse
Got me shackled up in chains, even made me change my name
But they couldn't trap my mind, this cry for freedom ain't in vain
See they taught us half the story, didn't know we came from glory
Years ago we was kings before the boats came and lured me
Woo, gotta keep runnin', gotta keep runnin'
Yah, cause they keep gunnin', and they keep comin'

[Hook: Priscilla Renea]
Runnin' like I know they comin' for me
I'm 'bout to spill enough blood to fill the red sea
Fear no evil, 'bout to set my people all free
If they crucify me, that's just what it's gon' be
Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Slaves, on the North side of Philly
Where they serve their mamas
And go spend that money they made on designer
We shoot at our brothers but run from the coppas
In front of Your Honor, beggin' for freedom
If freedom got free in it, why it ain't free then?
We go get a lawyer, a liar, that's descent
To meet with the District Attorney agreement
Like "take it or leave it, leave it or take it"
If we finna take it, I'm finna go straight for the win
(Winnin', winnin', winnin')
We started as slaves, we came up from nothin'
If I could live twice, I would do it again
Again and again, 'gain and again, huh
Who gon' love your momma on them drugs
Little babies that was never loved
So they run into the corner store
Quarter water only time they get a hug
Get some coca, only time they get some work
Say that it be poppin' on the first
He was poppin' when he had the money
'Til they popped him, now he ridin' in a hearse
This is real shit, nigga, not a verse
People really, really outta work
Kids starving somethin gotta work
Preacher even trappin' out the church
Put them shackles on my arm and leg
All them days made my body hurt
Locked my brothers all up in the cage
So we turn to prayer, hoping God will work

[Hook: Priscilla Renea]
Runnin' like I know they comin' for me
I'm 'bout to spill enough blood to fill the red sea
Fear no evil, 'bout to set my people all free
If they crucify me, that's just what it's gon' be
Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now

[Verse 1]
See it's a couple ways that we can go about this
We can carry on or we can flip a new switch
We can't just put a damper on the fire
And never take the chance to let it rise up
Maybe 'cause we know it won't survive us
Afraid to let it burn

[Pre-Chorus]
We got one foot on "I love you"
The other one's on "it's over"
It's easier to just to lay down
But we may never break ground

[Chorus]
If we don't stand
For the future
For the new us
We'll be ruined
If we don't stand
For the future
For the new us
We'll be ruined

[Verse 2]
Tired of old traditions, I think it's time we made a change
Let's stay true to our religion, love's the only way
So don't you let them dim the light inside you
And never take the chance to let it rise up
Baby 'cause they know you're a survivor
But will they ever learn?

[Pre-Chorus]
We got one foot on "I love you"
The other one's on "it's over"
It's easier to just to lay down
But we may never break ground

[Chorus]
If we don't stand
For the future
For the new us
We will fail
If we don't stand
For the future
For the new us
We will fail

[Bridge]
Once we stand up we'll be one
Fighting together towards the strong
Knowing the battle's here at home
We can't afford to get it wrong

[Chorus: Variation]
So won't you stand
(Stand)
For the future
(For the future)
For the new us
(Stand)
For the children
(Stand)

Call me black muscle brand, GQ mustachin’ I’m in LA
Soaking up the sun and I’m laughing, what can I say?
I love the way the fans say they love me
I know it’s all because my God above me
But damn I’m feeling like Sam
Except my daddy ain’t stuck up no video game
Things changed, for the good
He watched my back until the world started knowin’ my name
This should be in the Bible
Middle finger up to the people who don’t like you
Who have no valid reason to say they never liked you
We don’t give a fuck, fam
So what?! We never liked you niggas anyway
Pardon my wizard talk, but I’m elevated
No drank, no tree and I’m levitated
I got my own empire, I’m the baby
I ain’t taking care of nobody but my daughter and my mom
Places to go cause I need to build a travel log
I travel while you jake niggas run a blog
Now run along, I got some shit that needs posting
While I’m winnin’ livin’ life, skippin’ grinnin’ on em
All hail King Wizard in the fuckin’ house
Been chill for a minute quiet as a mouse
Now I got the juice, call me Bishop when you see me round
I be showin’ love, showin’ love baby, dap and pound
Yeah, mmmmhmmmmm

[Chorus: Kid Cudi, Kanye West & Michael Jackson]

People talk shit about me and they know that I know
And they also knowing they ain't right
Hmmm, when I walk in the room, they can't look in my eyes
'Cause when I walk in the room, they can't look in my eyes
(You know what you did to me, babe)

[Verse]
Tony dead and his brother too
Streets talkin' every week the coppers comin' through
And homicides scoopin' niggas out of Paulie crew
Damn, he in some shit just like a number two
So he need that lawyer money, plus that Sig Sauer money
On his second body so you don't want to war with money
Paulie got the word that somebody turned informant on him
Remember when he banged on Tony brother spin the corner on him
Maybe its them young niggas, talkin' to the police
Thinking about it every night, ain't been gettin' no sleep
He been spinnin' 'round that same corner for the whole week
Lookin' for them muthafuckers that was there with Tony brother when he let the clip roll on 'em
Going crazy thinkin' 'bout who told on him
Time tickin' doors 'bout to close on him
Them boys on the way to see the judge for a warrant
And they got his name on it, tryna put them chains on him
Cold as them streets is, he tryna remain on it
Even though the cops lurkin', got to keep them things on 'em
Layin' low at Kee crib, only one ain't changed on him
And she givin' info, told where to hit for
Put 'em deep with Tony lil' cousins and his kin folk
Paulie on some other shit, tryna get 'em sent for
Them young nigga bendin' backwards for him like its limbo
And they tryna kill somethin', cops tryna build somethin'
Paulie ain't tryna do no time take a deal, nothin'
Loadin' up his AK banana tryna peel somethin'
Tryna catch a rat nigga slippin' 'fore they spill somethin'
Somebody gon' die
And mommas gon' cry
Before Paulie doin' time
Cause Paulie gon' ride
Back in the field he got his 40 on him
Watchin' out for tinted windows when they pull up on him
He don't even trust the niggas 'round the corner from him
That he grew up with, he done got into it with
Investigatin' niggas if they tellin' or not
And then they feel some type of way he disrespectin' the block
But Paulie don't give a fuck, you disrespect him, you shot
Live by the chopper law and respect of the Glock
Hold up the phone ringin' said they rushin' the spot
The only time he play that crib is when he fuckin' a thot
He was fuckin' with Kee and she was fuckin' an op
But he ain't never think about it, she'll fuck with the cops
She told 'em everything nigga
I know you thought that she'll never sing would you?
Rule number one: keep them bitches from out your business
Rule number two: better kill 'em you know they snitchin'
It's all fun and games 'til them bitches turn to a witness
And know you in the courtroom waiting to get your sentence
Saw you out at Kee crib four in the morn'
Parked up seat low to the floor
She on the way he feel a way, this was one of his whores
And since he been on the run, he been fuckin' em more
Thinkin' about her if she come, open the door
Take a deep breath, I know what I'm doin'
Cause she gon' go to court and she gon' go to the morgue
And he gon' to jail and she gon' go to the mall
So he started walkin' while she parking
Wasn't even cautious
Parked up on her, had to drive her window out the darkness
He was supposed to shoot her, but he started talkin'
She screamin' out "I'm pregnant," now he thinkin' "Aw shit"
Started second guessin', that's when them cars spin
Paulie heart dropped he seen the Taurus
So he took off runnin' with the hammer, tried to toss it
Cops shootin' metal slugs rippin' through the car tint
Bullets hit his body while he runnin' and now he fallin'
Damn Paulie, bullet holes
Cuffs on let him bleed
Double murder, attempted murder, yes indeed
If he live, life sentence never leave
If he dies nobody cry for the bad guy
Fronted niggas workin' they the glad guys
Happy they ain't got to pay the tab guys
Paulie make it through to see the trap God
Drownin' in his own blood on his back side
They say he gon' pull through and he gettin' charged too
Lawyer came to see him said he need like 80 large too
Got him in the County Tony people 'hind them walls too
And they say his little cousin crippin' bangin' hard too
And Paulie killed his favorite little cousin back on Part 2
And he can't wait to fall through
Friday they callin' yard too
And Paulie on crutches took the screw up out the handles scrape that bitch 'til it got sharp too
To be continued
I, know, you, want me to fall
But, I can't
Part 4 gon' be a movie nigga, literally
Lyrics From Snippet

[Hook: Akon]

[?] die by the gun
Say me and my dogs 

[?], feeling like the one (Ooh Yeah)
And I never go no where without my gun

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Turn them headphones up, Cruz
Way up
Shit, like I'm Jackie Chan
Summer is lit and we back again

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I'm so way up, way up, way up, way up (Way up)

Run a check and tell 'em pay up (Run it)
It's all business, ain't no favors (Woo)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
That indirect shit never get by us
Niggas like bitches be dick ridin'
Funny how nigga like Rich Pryor
See 'em and I smack the shit out 'em
Throwin' ten k like it's ten dollars
I grab that bitch, make a ten out her
I pop a Perc, fuck the shit out her
Fuck her so good, thought I care 'bout her
She know I been 'bout it, I'm on my way up
My chick a Barbie, no weave and no makeup
Hang with the trappers, don't be with no haters
My city gon' tell you that we on some paper
Theolonius capers when I'm in that Wraith
I'm feelin' like Meechie '03 ATL
Purp got leanin' like I'm on a rail
Mixing that Birk with that new YSL
Sellin' that dope gave me confidence
Bust down the Role gave me confidence
I let the fiend wash the coupe, tell him, "Polish it"
She on my dick, I can't make you no promises
Bahgdad on that pussy, bombin' shit
Bad bad with that chopper, Osama shit
Rockin' Givenchy shit
Trap at the clear port, nigga, we flyin' shit

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I'm so way up, way up, way up, way up (Way up)
Can't believe they tried to play us (What?)
Run a check and tell 'em pay up (Run it)
It's all business, ain't no favors (Woo)
I'm so way up, way up, way up, way up (Way up)
Summer comin', better save up (It's comin!)
Going up like elevators (Comin up!)
I'm so way up, way up, way up, way up (Way up, way up, way up)

[Verse 2: Tracy T]
Way up, way up, way up
Skinny nigga walkin' like done got his weight up
Hold up, bitch, I'm movin' fast, they holler, "Wait up"
Fixin' bitches just so I can fuck and break her
I been doin' this since Jacob came with Jacobs
If you know me, then you owe me, fuck you pay up
Bombin' in Atlana a.k.a. Al-Queda
Crossin' up I'm Kyrie Irving with the lay up
Pushin' whips and poppin' pistols for the paper
Goin' up, they want to stop your elevator
Havin' lunch on top of Barneys, feelin' way up
Paper on Rodeo, aye ho, I got flavor
Meek Milly pull up that Wraith up
I pull up with work like I'm Rayful
Put tens on that bitch for the haters
That work it came in from Laredo
Got birds and got bricks and they came in the trailer
Them niggas ain't poppin' shit, got a shot on me like I am Stojaković
Broke the law, fuck it, lil' nigga, it got me rich
Ya you might got a gun but you ain't poppin' it
Nigga doin' dirty business, goddamn, Lord save 'em
Dirty money on the low, it got me way up, way up, way up

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I'm so way up, way up, way up, way up (Way up)
Can't believe they tried to play us (What?)
Run a check and tell 'em pay up (Run it)
It's all business, ain't no favors (Woo)
I'm so way up, way up, way up, way up (Way up)
Summer comin', better save up (It's comin!)
Going up like elevators (Comin up!)
I'm so way up, way up, way up, way up (Way up, way up, way up)

[Intro]
Niggas tried to crucify me
We ain't never gon' stop
We come from the motherfucking dirt, you can't bury me, nigga

[Verse 1]
'Member niggas tried to bury me
Kept it real, now they mad at me
Thought the memes would embarrass me
But I done really been through tragedy
Middle of the jungle where the killers rumble
Hold the chopper up with accuracy
Knock the power out his battery
Make his mama feel the agony
When it's beef, who gon' really ride?
Play it neutral, nigga switchin' sides
Niggas worser than these ho bitches
They don't really know whose dick to ride
In the Bentley with the stick inside
I can't lose my life in the field
Gotta pay the lights and the bills
I ain't got time for a cell
They threw the book at the kid (the kid)
You really can look what they did (they did)
That shit just made me a monster
I took the book and I ran
I got niggas takin' real L's
Gave 'em life and they booked in the fed
I put a stack on their phone
I fill their books up with bread
Oodles and noodles for breakfast
Made me so young and so reckless
Come up and they ain't expecting it
I'm 'bout to teach 'em a lesson
I'm the one that taught the youngins
When you come from nothin', niggas gon' respect you (they did)
From the muscle, now we flexin'
Fuck it up and then we exit

[Chorus]
They know I'ma ride for this shit
They know I'ma die for this shit
I had to get me some money (some money)
And I put the squad on this shit (I did)
Remember they said I would lose (remember?)
Them niggas was poppin' and shit (they what?)
So fuck 'em, we breaking the rules (rules)
I'm like LeBron in this shit
Ho!

[Verse 2]
Came back off of three to one (three to one)
Who thought that I'd be the one? (who?)
In the darkness, I can see the sun
Heard 'em comin', they ain't even come (pussy)
I put fear in these niggas' heart (pussies)
I can hear when these niggas talk (pussies)
I can hear when they hatin' on me (pussies)
Still playin' with a bigger heart (ho)
Fuck it, I'ma take the high road (high road)
Kill these niggas with my eyes closed
Out in Cali with my vatos
Wrap the chicken like a gyro
I've been trappin' since like '05
Gettin' it and duckin' 5-0
They ain't even never see the paper
That's Dorito, paper, boy that's nachos
On the 'Gram, like it lit (You ain't lit)
Punch your man, he's a snitch (You a rat)
Put some money on a nigga head
Last time I made a hit (bad)
I've been chillin' tryna get the bread
Try play me like vic (Suckers!)
Did him dirty out the rip (prrrr)
I ain't even wanna trip (ho)
Bullet holes in your car door (car door)
Just to let you know the war is on (war is on)
In my hood it's like a warzone (yeah)
Niggas really gettin' sparked on (yeah)
Young nigga tryna make it out (make it out)
Used to have to get our starve on
Brought the richest to the baddest bitches
Now I'm pullin' Wraiths with the stars on

[Chorus]
They know I'ma ride for this shit
They know I'ma die for this shit
I had to get me some money (some money)
And I put the squad on this shit (I did)
Remember they said I would lose (remember?)
Them niggas was poppin' and shit (they what?)
So fuck 'em, we breaking the rules (rules)
I'm like LeBron in this shit
Ho!

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, keepin' it triller, I walk in the dealer
I'm 'bout to go ham with my young niggas (word)
You know the rule, if you see me in traffic
Don't dap me, you know I don't fuck with you (word)
Rollin' with Nicki and we in the 'Bach and she heated
'Cause I brought the drum with us (word)
You know I'm fresh out the slums, nigga (slums, nigga)
I know it never was love, nigga (woo)
I'm in the trenches, I'm hangin' with killers
An' robbers an' all of the drug dealers (hitters)
We in the section, we plottin' on takin' your chain
When you leave out the club, nigga (stick 'em)
Show no mercy like a 'lago ('lago)
Ain't no money, ain't no convo (convo)
Get your bitch some Louis Vuittons, though
In the back, hit it with the combo (hey-ya)
Bust down, bust down (bust down)
Meek Milly back, like, what now? (what now?)
Bitches that fronted way back in the day
All on the kid like, "What up now?" (up now?)
I'm like, "What's up now?" (sup, bitch?)
You fuck with that lame an' you stuck now (stuck now)
Bulletproof all in the truck now (truck now)
Promethazine in my cup now (cup now)
When you be poppin', these niggas dick ridin'
An' pretty bitches wanna fuck now (woo)
I'm up now (up now), I guess it's love now (love now)
I guess it's all cool (all cool), dope in the dog food (dog food)
Lamborghini got her pussy wet, call it a carpool (whoa)

[Chorus: Young Thug]

Fucking in around, we ain't fucking around
I can't fuck with these niggas, they shady (no)

Frauds, I know these niggas gon' talk about 'em (yeah, yeah)
We gettin' money, they talk about it (yeah, yeah)
We never ever gon' talk about it (yeah, yeah)
We only trappin' and talking dollars
Wait, wait, wait, I'm tryna flip it, get all the profits (flip it)
I hit his bitch now he callin' bout it
I told that nigga I'm sorry 'bout it
Shawty popping in a dog filter (yeah)
I'm a dog, I'm a dog nigga (yeah)
I'm a shooter, I don't call niggas (what?)
On the D'Usse like Wall nigga (woo)
Cross her over, hit her with the woooh
In the Wraith, stars in the roof
Light her up like Pikachu
In the Ghost, playing peek-a-boo
Wait, wait, wait, niggas can't figure me out, hey
I got this stick in the house, hey
I keep a brick in the couch, hey
Sit on that shit in a drought, hey
Sell it for triple the amount, hey
Stack it up, bag it up, add it up, ready for shippin', we sendin' it out

[Intro: Snowy White]
This is my blues
'Cause I'm back down on my own again
This is the blues I'm playing
Yes, it's a fine old thing
When the night is cold and low
(This is a Dollar Bill beat)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Was it the money that made me a savage?
Poppin' them Percs and I made it a habit
Totin' them pistols and serving them addicts
That was exciting to me, I'm so excited to be
Started with nothin', we had to inspire to be
Niggas ain't flyer than me, I'm getting to it
Feel like the man, I got the plan
I call the shooters, they hop out the van
Play with the squad, get popped like a Xan
Pop like a Perc, I'm goin' ham
I'm goin' crazy on niggas, too wavy for niggas
Do magic like alakazam
I'm in the kitchen compressin' a birdie
Take out a nine and I sell it for thirty
Then straight to the jeweler, I'm bustin a Rollie
To light up the city like Meechie in '03
I got the plug, he send 'em OT
Don't know these niggas, these niggas know me
Even old niggas, they call me OG
Young nigga but I put it down
We was on it when it weren't 'round
All of sudden niggas wanna come around
Stay over there, my G

[Interlude: Meek Mill & Snowy White]
This is my blues
Do me one favor, take a few steps back
'Cause I'm back down on my own again
And look at yourself
Matter fact, take yourself outside your body
And then look at yourself
And see how you playing yourself, nigga
This is the blues I'm playing
Congratulations, it's the motherfuckin' Chasers
Yes, it's a fine old thing
You feel me? We on it
When the night is cold and low

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Gave you the plug
Try to be real with some niggas and put 'em on money
And show 'em some love
You did me a favor, I knew you was sheisty
I knew you would show who you was
It's only a matter of time before niggas get lined
And hit with them slugs
Get found in a pool of your blood, yeah, nigga
'Member they told me that we would fail
'Member they said we would see a cell
Down with that semi like Cam Newton
I'm in the field like the NFL
Niggas is sick' and I wish em well
I made a wish in a wishing well
I put a brick in a wishing well
Been through some shit and I'm sick of jail
No disease but I'm sick of cells
Sick and tired of sending niggas mail
Calling niggas just to get a bail
I just seen a nigga get a L
Never coming homeand minute on the phone
Sick and tired of seeing niggas fail
Sick and tired of seeing niggas lose
Sinning like we tryna get to hell

[Outro: Snowy White]
This is my blues
'Cause I'm back down on my own again
This is the blues I'm playing
Yes, it's a final thing
When the night is cold and low
Is there relief
For tender-headed hearts
We'll find reprieve
When from this earth we part

Na na na na na na na na na...

The sky seems clear
Devoured with closed eyes
The end draws near
Your body severs ties

Na na na na na na na na na...

Been waiting for
This moment
For too long to regret
You let go
Your spirit flows
Your troubles
Ascend
Na na na na na na na na na...

[Chorus 1]
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely world
Casts a shadow on the shallow love it hurls
To the feet of swine it need not cast its pearls
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely world

[Verse 1]
And the sound of the void
Flows through your body undestroyed
And the sound of your voice
Flows from your body, white as noise

[Verse 2]
And the void speaks to you
In ways nobody speaks to you
And that voice fills the air
Fog in the morning going nowhere

[Chorus 2]
Lonely, lonely, lonely face under a veil
After all the laughter, emptiness prevails
Born into this world with no consent or choice
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely...

[Intro]
What we doing, Flex?
They see us, Funk Flex, Meek Mill, 017
I mean, why not?
Dreamchasers in the building, you know what it is
Philly, New York City, what's up?
All my NY niggas, what's up?
The mafia, ha, let's get it!

[Verse 1]
Mixed the Balmain with the Bape shit, I've been going ape shit
Finna go banana like the K clip
Niggas talk about me, they see me and never say shit
Keep them suckers dippin' and dodgin', like it's The Matrix
Heart full of hatred, show it on the Internet
Weirdo niggas in my comments, but we ain't into that
We was in there making it double and tryna get it back
Bust a thousand traps all in it and take that rental back
Couple hundred, tint it black, tryna make a mil in it
I'ma let 'em shuffle when I cut it, got to deal with it
When I got it, put my homies on like a real nigga
And they all still with us
Seen too many trill niggas fall to let you bitch niggas beat me
'Fore I take a loss they gon' have to RIP me
But that'll never happen, take this war shit deeply
My young niggas starving in them trenches and they need me
They like, "Meek Milly, won't you spit that crack again?"
Fake niggas up three, bring us back again
Riding down Broad Street, I'm in the Bach again
I bully niggas, I'm unlike Mac again
Philly, money can't make me, suckers can't break me
Back to back jabs, but I'm still gettin' eighty
Just to walk through, and have them hoes going crazy
All this cash money, got me stuntin', like I'm Baby
Posted up with Nicki, that's when it get tricky
Niggas in their feelings, that's when it get drizzy
Speaking on the Chasers, definitely get busy
We get money, stay a hundred, we don't never keep it 50
And we don't cosign no rats over here, my G
On scopes on them straps over here, my G
Lot of security with badges over there, I see
You brought the law with you, I brought them hittas with me
It ain't a nigga that I met I thought was realer than me
I'm 'bout to take 'em 4th quarter, I can feel it in me
Catch 'em on the inbound, watching for the shot clock
5-4-3-2-1, pull up for the jumpshot
Swish, nigga! We used to play Sega
Now its Glock 40, with the red lasers
Niggas want to kill us, but they can't fade us
Play them corners, we trappin', watch for the damn neighbors
Call the cops on us, and we had them Glocks on us
Pocket full of rocks on us, they was sending SWAT for us
Super predators, is what they said of us
Watching bodies drop on the regular, it was regular
Said it made us cold, but really that shit affected us
Fell in love with hoes, they the only one that accepted us
White folks was prejudiced, so the foreign's all black
We done turned nothing into something; what you call that?
Eighteen, caught my first case, had to fall back
Ten years of probation probably set us all back
Started public housing, now we Kings
Grandma and Mama, we called 'em queens
Chasing that money, and chasing dreams
Serving out people, ‘cause they was fiends
On the North side of Philly, where niggas'll serve they mamas
And go spend that money they made on a new designer
They say I'm still stuck in my ways, and to be honest
I probably am; sorry, Your Honor!
I was made like this, I was raised like this
Selling coke to get a mil, shit, I got paid like this

[Interlude]
New York City! What we doing, Flex?
Special cloth, special cloth
Shout out to DJ Khaled, this that special cloth
At the radio station
Going brazy with your boys in the building
New York City, what the fuck is up?
We here! Let's get it! Let's get it, Flex!

[Verse 2]
I'm from a hood of broken dreams
Shots firing, yellow tape on the scene, as spooky as Halloween
Go to school, what do you mean?
When your mama a fiend but your lil' sister a queen
And the fridge so empty it's hurtin' your self-esteem
Now to get out on the corner and get it by any means
How the judge gon' judge us when this is all that we seen?
This is all that we know, eviction note at the door
So we pray like we gon' get to eat one day
I promise we gon' beat them streets one day
Running 'round, living reckless
Knowing we gon' live at peace one day
I'm thinking, "Should I get to sleep some day?"
‘Cause I've been up all night chasing this cake
To feed my mama and them
Summer-time, you hear them sirens again
They said, "That boy won't make it."
You hear them screams, Mama crying again
We had to kill and get as violent as them, we tryna live
My young bull, she was supposed to go to the league
Started popping on them P's, running 'round with the fleas
All them A's and them B's start to turn into C's
Go from crossing niggas over into running from D's
'Fore you know it coppers pointing at you, telling you "Freeze!"
And you can't afford a lawyer, so they telling you "Plea!"
Man, this shit worse than cancer, like a fucking disease
Living this nightmare, they telling us "Dream!"
Look what they did to Martin Luther, bullet holes in our Kings
And they wonder why we never believe
And they wonder why we never would leave
Nigga, we poor, young niggas worrying about that corner store
But the chinks own that
And you claiming that's your block; who you think own that?
Quicksand in the hood and we gon' sink on that
You should think on that
Poison water out in Flint, they let them little babies drink on that; they don't care about us

[Interlude]
New York City
DC4 on the motherfucking way
You already know what it is
We only doing it strictly for the streets
We ain't doing it for the Internet
Strictly inspiration for the streets
Motivation for my young niggas behind them walls
My young niggas stuck in the trenches
You know what it is
New York City like my fuckin
Second home, nigga
Flex, we in the building
Hot97, you already know what it is

[Verse 3]
Views from the trap, nigga
I'm back, nigga, with two 9's; Warren Sapp, nigga
The crack dealers was new slaves, I toot Tre's
Jordan with the mic, making dudes fade, I do says
Sippin' on that shit like it's Kool-Aid
Rollie with the blue face, diamonds, they clear as Blu-ray
Suckers in all they new ways, different chapter, a new page
You fake if you don't speak to me
Real soon as you wave, I get it
Favorite singer, favorite rapper, I hit it, I'm with it
Try to tell me I'm losing and niggas winnin'?
They ain't want to see me on the yacht, no
They don't want to see me in the drop, no
Coming down Collins with my young niggas wildin' on the bike
Vroom, vroom, 12 o' clock, whoa
Hear no evil, I don't see no evil
Pocket full of dead presidents; them C-note people
We thought you was flamin' hot, why you cheat those people?
You fraud niggas, we can't believe those people
I need a witness
Now back to them trenches, we trap on them benches
With MAC's with extensions, this Shawshank Redemption
Locked my body up, but my soul free
Niggas do not know me, so how could they oppose me?
Kill 'em with success, they gon' kill me with emojis
Kill me with a meme, you pussies never could expose me
Did I fuck his bitch? Maybe it was the 'gram
Hurting these niggas hearts, I really can't understand
I started off with a dollar, turned it into a grand
Flipped it into a milli, I'm still reppin' my city
I pull up poppin' a wheelie, bending corners on coppers
Toting choppers and whiping the work up like Betty Crocker
Money, power, the crab in the barrel, no getting out it
What I told 'em, but I'm in Miami eating on Lobster
Bad bitches, I bag bitches that bag bitches
They mad niggas, they only hate, I get the cash quicker
Savages that blast with us, I past niggas
I lap niggas, I bend the corner, ride past niggas
I know how that money feel
Delaware State, landing choppers on the fucking field
My life so fucking real
I don't never go to sleep, ‘cause I'm trying to see a hundred mil
That automatic automatically on me
I automatically clap suckers for running up on me
And automatically smack suckers and fuck up their homies
Finna fuck up that money, you think it did something to me?
I do things, new things
I'm getting blue cheese, no hot wings
I really cop things, new V's and hard top
And y'all niggas saying hoop dreams was hard rock
And serving samples to the new fiends, whoa

[Verse 1]
Shawty, you know how I'm strokin' on it
When I pull up 4 in the mornin'
We can smoke, girl, if you want it
We can smoke, just roll up pon it
I do the things that you wan' do
All of the things that you want too
Do anything 'cause I want you
Do anything 'cause I want you
Oh, pull up in designer
Girl, that body's purer than water, smell like Dasani
Sippin' on Henny
'Bout to hit your bitch with that see you in the mañana
Mi need a bad one by me
Mi need a bad one beside me
They see dem suck pussy boi, try me
Bodmon, you can't do ah man grimy
Mi gun on me

Smokin' on Bob Marley

[Chorus]
A bodmon song
A bodmon song mi ah sing, yeah

[Verse 2]
When I pull up in Armani

One bodmon song
One bodmon song man ah sing, yeah
Let's hang out so I can tear my head apart
And you look so proud so I just wanna break your heart
In my head I don't ever have to feel the pain
In my head I don't ever have to hear your name

And your face is just an empty never-ending space
I'm so sick of putting all this shit back in its place
Who's that kid fucking all your friends and taking off
Who's that kid I heard you were with when I was gone

It's okay 'cause I feel nothing
Yeah it's okay 'cause I feel nothing
One day all this will make sense
But just promise me you won't ever forget
There are two kinds of men in this world
Ones who move on, stroll on, and ones who never learn
Don't you need me? At least to tell you what you're worth
I've been waiting too long and no it doesn't hurt
To be moving on, strolling along I think that I can learn
Oh we'll see how much you think I'm really worth

Deep down mysteries can't be solved yet can't you see
I got a little black present hiding for ya under your seat
I said a-deep down mysteries can't be solved yet can't you see
I got a little black present hiding for ya under your seat

Deep down mysteries can't be solved yet can't you see
I got a little black present hiding for ya under your seat
I said a-deep down mysteries can't be solved yet can't you see
I got a little black present hiding for ya under your seat
I sing of what you see and might think about
Because of what you see
Moving hands, mobile faces
Where by the eye
Not the ear traces what's on the mind

So when you see hands
Weaving the space between friends
Think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices
Speech without sound face to face, hands unbound
Weaving the space between friends
So, think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices

Believe it they ramble on exactly as we would
And talking with someone we know
And even they stumble on expressions as we would
And talking with anyone

So..
When you see hands weaving
The space between friends
Think of them as telling or asking
Or spelling out choices
So think of hands as being
As though you are seeing voices

Think of them as being
As though they were seeing voices
Speech without sound face to face, hands unbound
Weaving the space between friends
So, think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices

So think of hands as asking or telling
Or spelling out choices
Just think of hands as being
As though you were seeing voices

Voices, voices

[Verse 1]
I can name a couple ways, baby, this shit might go
You just might forget that this was what you're gettin' high for
Men that like to do the things to remain that guy who
Need someone who's sweet and not gon' shoot to make that high note

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's such a typical thing
Runnin' over billion men who
Only deal with difficult things
You gon' need a billion hands, ooh

[Chorus]
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy (Candy), she's so sweet (She's so sweet)
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real

[Verse 2]
I can be your sugar when you're fiendin' for that sweet spot
Put me in your mouth, baby, and eat it 'til your teeth rot
I can be your cherry, apple, pecan, or your key lime
Baby I got everything and so much more than she's got

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's such a typical thing
Runnin' over billion men who
Only deal with difficult things
You gon' need a billion hands, ooh

[Chorus]
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy (Candy), she's so sweet (She's so sweet)
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy (Candy), she's so sweet (She's so sweet)
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real

[Bridge]
Sugar coated, lies unfolded, you still lick the wrapper
It's addictive, you know this, but you still lick the wrapper
Sugar coated, lies unfolded, you still lick the wrapper
It's addictive, you know this, but you still lick the wrapper

[Chorus]
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real
Do you think that you can be exactly what you want to be?
Do you think that you can be exactly what you want to be?
Do you think that you can be exactly what you want to be?
Do you think that you can be exactly what you want to be?
Do you think that you can be exactly what you want to be?
Do you think that you can be exactly what you want to be?
Do you think that you can be exactly what you want to be?
Do you think that you can be exactly what you want to be?
Do you think that you can be exactly what you want to be?
Well anyway
You may be saying about now
"How in the world is that old fella eat all of that crazy stuff
And not get sick to his stomach?"
Haha, well, don't worry about that
You see, whenever I make a pig of myself on the filet
Or the pudding or something
I mix up some herbs and
I come up with a dandy glass of this
Bicarbonate of fig leaf
That'll set me free, I'll tell you
Ugh

Edible wrappers may be in grocery stores as soon as months from now
You've heard of good to the last drop
Well your food could soon be good to the last bite

Wow! That was loud!
Got to ya, huh?

Here's an interesting note: artificial colors
Yellows or Reds
Let's focus on the red
In addition to FD&C Red Number 40, the FDA has approved certain food coloring additives, some are actually poison!
If you aren't sure of the additives or colorings in the products you've purchased, leave it alone!
Posion!
Bad news!
That's right!
Thank you
Well, I think that about covers all of the natural foods out here
Now then, I have to go take my dessert here
I have to go
I'm conducting a cooking class today
Good health to you all!
Uh, over this way
Look out!

Alright Pops, still feel like charging me for that meal?

One look at his feature-less face
One look was enough to ensure his safety
As years passed, he became even more bitter and angry
Burning with vengeance against the world
Finally, amidst hidden scrolls, he found what he'd been seeking
Then, clothed in a suit of invulnerable armor, and possessing the worlds greatest secrets of science and magic, he returned to his homeland
And there he has remained
Scheming, dreaming, planning
Plotting his mad campaign to conquer the entire world
(I can't believe it!)
(Alright, alright, don't make a big deal about it)
I warn you Doom, you've gone too far
(Yeah!)
That'll do it Doom, get your machine
We'll run wild
We'll run wild
We'll run wild
We'll run wild
We'll run wild
We'll run wild
We'll be glowing in the dark

Stole a key
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
Saw the lights go down and standing in front of me

In my scarecrow dreams
When they smash my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting through concrete
Be a cartoon heart
Light a fire a fire a spark
Light a fire a flame in my heart
We’ll run wild
We’ll be glowing in the dark
We’ll be glowing in the dark
All the boys, all the girls, all that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls, all the madness that occurs
All the highs all the lows, as the room a-spinning goes
We’ll run wild, we’ll be glowing in the dark

We’ll be glowing in the dark
We’ll be glowing in the dark
In the dark
She said, “Come over after school
So I can have some fun with you”
We do that special thing you do
When somebody is in love with you

Her grandpa died in the night last week
I think he was seventy-three
I told her I'd do anything
I said that I would do anything

I hurt myself real good that night
It gave my mother quite a fright
She called the doctor up to see
Just what the fuck was wrong with me

The problem, I believe
Is the realization that all of this doesn't mean a thing
In the long run
And it hurts to know that
Everything is nothing
And I don't mind
When you’re around me

[Intro]
Tonight
I just want to take you higher
Throw your hands up in the sky
Let's set this party off right

[Chorus]
Players, put yo' pinky rings up to the moon
Girls, what y'all trying to do?
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player
Uh, look out!

[Verse 1]
Pop pop, it's show time (Show time)
Show time (Show time)
Guess who's back again?
Oh they don't know? (Go on tell 'em)
Oh they don't know? (Go on tell 'em)
I bet they know soon as we walk in (Showin' up)
Wearing Cuban links (ya)
Designer minks (ya)
Inglewood's finest shoes (Whoop, whoop)
Don't look too hard
Might hurt ya'self
Known to give the color red the blues

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh shit, I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket
(Keep up)
So many pretty girls around me and they waking up the rocket
(Keep up)
Why you mad? Fix ya face
Ain't my fault y'all be jocking

[Chorus]
Players only, come on

Second verse for the hustlas (hustlas)
Gangstas (gangstas)

Can I preach? (Uh oh) Can I preach? (Uh oh)
I gotta show 'em how a pimp get it in
First, take your sip (sip), do your dip (dip)
Spend your money like money ain't shit (Whoop, whoop)
We too fresh
Got to blame it on Jesus
Hashtag blessed
They ain't ready for me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket

So many pretty girls around me and they waking up the rocket

Uh, look out

[Outro]
(24 karat magic, magic, magic)
Day One Up in This Bitch!

I’ve never been one who doesn’t take full responsibility for his actions, but damn, I really don’t deserve this. If I hadn’t traded my blue Marc Jacobs jeans, white polo, and gray Vans for green onesies, I wouldn’t have believed this shit myself.

I had to talk to the prison psychiatrist when I got here. I told her that I shouldn’t be talking to her because I’m not crazy … but I ended up really enjoying her conversation. Is that crazy? We talked about traveling the world, where we’ve been and where we would like to go, BUT both of us were in jail … crazy!

My next conversation didn't go so well. As I was being led to the captain's office, I was still just trying to figure out what I was about to go through. I got lost in the thought of how each step that I made was one step farther from everything that I love. And to what? A world of dysfunction, disrespect, and distrust. Come to think of it, it is sort of like the music biz only without the female groupies.

As soon as I sat down in the captain's office, his exact first words to me were, "Don't fuck with my staff!" Damn! Definitely won't be getting any celebrity treatment from the captain. The whole conversation was him telling me, “Don't come in here trying to be what you are. You're not gonna ‘Lil Wayne’ up this mothafucka!”

All I was thinking was, Since there's nothing else to explain here, I'm done with this dude, so just take me to my cell and I'll stay out of your way. After the captain's great words of discouragement, I was handed a towel, two sheets, a toothbrush, toothpaste, and a green cup. Oh yeah, and a cell, cell 29.

As soon as I heard the cell door lock behind me, I just sat on the back wall and the tears began to flow as I took my first glimpse at my new digs: three buckets, one bed, one toilet that was surprisingly kind of clean (emphasis on kind of), a rusty-ass sink with a mirror the size of a small notepad, a desk, and a window. A clothesline was left hanging in the cell. I decided to leave it because I figured it would come in handy.

I got in just in time for chow, which is the overall term used for what they call breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I only ate the veggies because I wasn't too sure what the other stuff was.

I wasn't in the mood to do much socializing, so I kept the first-day meet and greet short. I guess not everybody on staff got the captain's memo because two C.O.’s were suspended for trying to come up and see me ... females of course. Maybe there will be some female groupies in the bitch after all.

Fuck ... one down!

Welcome 2 Da Family
Woke up at 4 a.m. for breakfast "chow." I had coffee that was given to me along with some other "goodies." The guys on my tier made me feel like I was a part of a family ... like a brotherhood. I was the new brother and they showed me love just like one. All in all, they gave me magazines, tea, some better soap than the prison's soap, an earphone radio, and extra chow.

There's Chris, who gave me the radio. He looks 15 years old, like he's in here for stealing gum. There's Lawson, who gave me the magazines and taught me how to use the phone. Twenty-one minutes every five hours. Sheesh!  There's Herb. He gave me some advice on how to do this time. Shit like, make sure to stick to myself, and to create a daily regimen to keep myself busy every day. He suggested working out, but I know my body ain't built for that. There's Al, whose cell is across from mine. He's 50-something, but he acts 20-something. Reminds me of an old Mafia guy. Then there's Coach! The guy that likes guys ... you know it had to be one of those. But he can and will get anything you need. I guess you can call him a "sweetheart," haha!

Now, as far as the C.O.’s, there's one who really stood out. White dude. He's loud, funny, and mad cool. He kept it so real with me from the jump, like, “Stay away from all these bitch-ass niggas ... none of them are your friends.” Him being a C.O., he knew why everybody was up in this bitch. Let's just say that he pointed out all the dudes who became gangstas mysteriously overnight when they found out that I was coming ... haha!

And then there's Ms. Burke. Owwww! She's so sexy! She has a head full of gray hair, but she's not old. I'm not sure what caused it, but she said that her hair has been gray since she was 13. My first impression was that it's just her swag and she dyed it gray on purpose. That's how cool it looks on her. I mean she's fine as hell. I'd definitely hit it!

Still Got It!!!

Shot hoops with Al in the yard. I sucked. He was much better and he's 57! No sooner when I got back to the cell at 2:45 p.m., I was back out to take the test for the suicidal-protection aide job. I passed with a 100, no lie. Guess I still got it. And I guess I still get that moola, baby, because SPA is the highest-paying job an inmate can get. The job is basically to monitor the tier for an eight-hour shift and if someone wants to hang up (meaning to kill themselves), to not negotiate with them or try to talk them out of it, but just to alert an officer. Yeah, it's that real.

When I got back to the cell, I wrote some rhymes and did some push-ups until about 4:30. Ended up playing checkers with Dominicano. Lost!

Then I had to get ready for my visit, which was Tez, Mack, and E.I. That was a great visit. I miss them niggas. Had chow when I got back. It was this chicken special that Coach and LL make. Shit was great! Also made my own rice and noodles with it and put it on a tortilla wrap. Shit was awesome. I felt fat.

Used the phone cautiously. Spoke to my little man D.M.C. III, he said, “Da-da.” Fucked up that I had to hear it for the first time in here, but still, Yeah!

Showered up quickly then had tea. It's 10:45 p.m. and I'm back in my cell listening to a game in the earphones as I write this.

Push-ups, prayer, sleep. Another day gone!

Jailhouse Rap

Read fan mail. Got some nice pictures today and Marisa sent me some Marc Jacobs cashmere socks, yeah!
Some people write the most bugged-out things. Everything from wanting to fall asleep with my dick in their mouth, to that I rep my city “astronomically”! Crazy, man! I love it! Also read the new Rolling Stone and I was in it. Yeah!

I rapped for the first time on the yard for Charlie and Jamaica. It's crazy that I've performed in front of millions of people since I was 8 years old, but for some reason I was nervous as hell. Rapping has always been second nature to me, but my creativity has definitely been put to a test since being in this bitch. I absolutely refuse to rap about being in jail. It's not who I am AND it's not who I'm going to be! I hope they liked it. I think they did.

Chris gave me two bags of Doritos. I gave him some bubble gum. It wasn't a trade, just two generous guys. But yeah, someone blessed me with some gum, a Now and Later, and a Jawbreaker today. Yeah!

As a Man

I woke up still feeling fucked up about the fucked-up day that I had. Hell is what it was! I'm used to arguing with my girl on a daily basis, but finding out that she fucked Drake was the absolute worst thing I could've found out.

As a man, honestly, that shit hurt, and not because it was Drake. It could've been any man and it would've hurt the same. She said it happened way before we got together, but she just never told me. When Drizzy came to see me, he was like, "Yeah it's true ... don't fuck with her like that ’cause I did fuck her." Damn!

This is the type of shit that a man never wants to find out while he's locked up. Or maybe so, ’cause only God knows what I would've done if I wasn't locked up right now. As soon as I found out, I told them to just lock me in, and I've basically just been by myself in my cell for the last couple of days.

Not sure how long I would've stayed in there if it weren't for Charlie. His fat ass wasn't going to let me just sit up in this bitch and not eat. He was like, "I don't give a fuck what you're mad about, we cooking no matter what, nigga. Come on man, let's eat!"

As a man I'll admit it: That shit really fucked me up, but hey, fuck that ho!

Love is blind, that's why I say make sure that bitch is a seeing-eye dog.

Another one gone!

He Runs the City

I woke up feeling like today was going to be different for some reason. I couldn't put my finger on it, but there seemed to be a buzz in the building. I had my morning coffee like usual and chilled in the dayroom waiting on my visit. And what a great visit it was. Diddy kept his word and visited me today. It was total chaos! Every captain in the building was down there! Even the deps and the warden! Everyone just wanted to see him. It was kind of aggravating, but it is what it is.
Here No More

Today started out on some regular-day shit, but that's definitely not the way it ended. Jamaica got deported. We were just chilling in this bitch and they just came and got him like he had a visit. The only difference was, they were like, "Jamaica, pack up your shit." Damn!

The fucked-up thing is that Jamaica and I have become ... damn, do I dare use the "F" word in jail ... but really have become like friends. He was always asking me if I could help him out with a lawyer or something just to keep him here because he was facing deportation.

At first, I would just brush it off, but it got to the point that I reacted as if he were one of my homies that I grew up with. I was like, “Nigga, don't ask me for shit just because you know I got it. It's because of me that we're eating right up in this bitch. Don't stretch it by asking for a lawyer and shit.” That's really how I looked at it at the time. I really didn't know it was that serious. I guess he really did need a better lawyer. Damn!

The whole ordeal made me realize how there are no real friends in jail. As fucked up as that sounds, that's the reality. I remember when White told me that. He was like, "Y'all niggas can be as cool as you want in here. You niggas can fight together, eat together, play ball together, and all that shit. But nobody ever gets out of this bitch on the same day. And whoever gets out of this bitch first ain't worrying about nobody ass that still up in here."

I pray for everybody in here, but I really don't see myself keeping in touch with anybody but a couple of C.O.’s who never acted like dicks toward me.

What a day … at least it's another one gone!

What's Really Real

Damn, I woke up this morning missing having normal conversations about everyday shit. The only time that I can have anything close to a normal conversation is with a C.O. I can't even begin to try and have that type of convo with an inmate because they're always lying about whatever they're talking about.

I'd have to be the most gullible mothafucka on the planet to believe the stories that these niggas tell me up in here. I mean like everybody in this bitch is a king, a boss, or a killer ... Everybody either has or has had a billion dollars. It's kind of sad because I know that they're just trying to boost their egos, which is probably why most of these mothafuckas are in here in the first place. Your life has to be crazy as fuck when jail is the place to boost your ego.

I don't ever want to come back to this bitch! There's absolutely nothing cool about jail. It's nasty. It's dirty. Everything is fucking used. Getting something new in the bitch is like winning the lottery. You have to be a certain mothafucka to get new shit. And since I get new bedsheets and shit, it's a good thing that I'm that certain mothafucka!

When I got back from the yard, I just stayed on the phone as much as possible. I was really craving some normal conversation. I'm sure this was all caused by this dude telling me to slow down because I was beginning to act like an inmate.

I got into an argument on the yard and went straight gorilla. I was as un–Lil Wayne as I could get. I was in a nigga face like, Fuck you, nigga, what's good? Niggas had to hold me back and shit. That's when this dude was like, "You go home to something nobody else in here goes home to ... dude, leave that nigga alone. He'll be back in this bitch next month. You don't want to be back in this bitch, man. Don't act that way. Go home, bro. You're a millionaire. You're a superstar. So act like one." I couldn't argue with that shit ... damn ... and yeah!

The Remix, Baby

Who knew that my spirit was about to be lifted through the roof! Tez was like, “We want you to be on Drake's remix.” I was like, “How?” And he was like, “We're going to do it over the phone.” I'm like, “Shit ... I don't have anything else better to do up in this bitch, so let's go!” After I finished running it, I was kinda nervous on how it was going to be received. This was the first time that I haven't been in the studio to hear the playback before a song goes out.

I can't front, I'm really bugging out knowing that I can record a song AND it would be on the radio and everything. My main thought is, Damn ... if I can do this, I'm about to go to the studio every night. I told Tez to have the mic on standby from here on out.

Nothing else that happened today mattered. Nothing can touch how happy I am. My creativity is at an all-time high right now! I'm actually looking forward to tomorrow.

Writing, writing, and more writing! Another one!

So Blessed

Just got back from my visit. I have the best friends, fans, and family in the world. I've been in this bitch for a good minute now and have never missed a visit yet. You get two visits a week and I haven't missed one yet! That shit is incredible ’cause I've never seen Jamaica get a visit. The only visit I saw him get was the mothafuckas who deported his ass came and got him. Coach has never got a visit. Dominicano has never got a visit. Charlie has never got a visit. I got every visit I was supposed to get. I've been able to look forward to seeing someone every chance I was able to see someone ... THANK GOD!

I even feel blessed when I argued with my girl during visits because it would become the topic of my day. And by the time we spoke later that day, the argument was so amplified in my head that I couldn’t wait to jump on the phone with her. Being that she was dealing with real-life shit and not up in the hellhole, she would normally have forgotten about the whole thing and be on some "I love you, Baby" vibe ... I'm like, BITCH!!! That shit might sound crazy, but it's awesome to have something to look forward to that takes your mind out of being in jail!

I told her I didn't want her to wear any panties so I can look at her pussy and shit one time. But since I never wear the same T-shirt, boxers, or socks more than one time EVER, my nigga E.I. always brings me new T-shirts, boxers, and socks every visit. And they have these extensive-ass searches before you come in here, so they made her put on a pair of boxers because they knew she didn't have on panties. Damn!

I have to give props where props are due ... big shout-out to Diddy, Chris Paul, and Kanye for coming to see me, especially with their schedules. I know that they had to go through some extra shit, because you just can't walk in this bitch and say, "I want to see Dwayne Carter.”

It's lock-in, so push-ups, Bible, prayer, slow jams, and sleep. Another one!
Days after the attack on Plastic Beach, Noodle awoke in a strange Japanese village that smelled of fish. It was a fishing village. She'd been nursed back to health by an old pearl diver named Chiyoko, so to repay her kindness, Noodle took a job as her apprentice.

She was a natural (having shared a tour bus with Murdoc, she was really good at holding her breath). But one day, deep beneath the waves, Noodle prized open a pearl shell of unearthly size, accidentally releasing an ancient hell demon. It scarpered, ready to party like it's 1499.

Noodle learned that this was Maazu, a shapeshifting devil of unimaginable evil, that could take human form. It had to be destroyed. To do so, she must remove its head from its body. Or the other way around.

But finding a shapeshifter is like looking for a beard at an Arcade Fire concert. For years, Noodle pursued Maazu across Japan, from the heights of Mt Fuji to the deepest, darkest forests. Finally, she tracked Maazu to Tokyo, where it had risen to the top of the criminal underworld.

Disguising herself as a geisha, Noodle infiltrated its debauched headquarters, The Demon's Lodge. And there, while Maazu was distracted by a heated bout of 'Drink While You Think', she lopped off its head. His earthly existence was over. And the carpet was ruined.

Escaping Mazuu's Sumo bodyguards, Noodle packed herself into a FedEx crate with dried fish, bottled water and a copy of Moby Dick - if she was ever to finish Melville's onerous classic, it was now.

Her package was addressed: West London, England - c/o Murdoc Niccals.

Zaytoven

[Chorus]
All this cash got me feeling aggressive
All this ice got me feeling aggressive
This drop top Rolls is so aggressive

All this ice got me feeling aggressive
All this cash got me feeling aggressive
This drop top Rolls is so aggressive
It got these hoes getting so aggressive

[Verse 1]
I'm Gucci Mane the legend, I don't fuck with you peasants
I'm too heavy to be petty, boy is you balling or begging?
Please stop calling me, nigga, 'cause I can't spare not a second
I gives a fuck 'bout a record, I got a criminal record
These boys so scared of big Gucci, they make subliminal records
Most of these rappers is pussy, they making feminine records
It ain't a nigga in the industry that I wanna meet
Your favorite rapper a sucker that's not surprising to me
You can't be talking to the police then try signing with me
I ain't cosigning these niggas, I'm only vouching for me
I ain't letting these soft ass niggas stand on no couches with me
You niggas wasn't in no trap house sacking up ounces with me, pussy

[Chorus]
All this cash got me feeling aggressive
All this ice got me feeling aggressive
This drop top Rolls is so aggressive
It got these hoes getting so aggressive
All this ice got me feeling aggressive
All this cash got me feeling aggressive
This drop top Rolls is so aggressive
It got these hoes getting so aggressive

[Verse 2]
I'm a business, a building, the man with the millions
Use collateral damage cause boy you just a civilian
You'se a sheep in a wolf outfit boy you just a chameleon
And you blend in good, but I'll hurt more than your feelings
I'm a monster, a mobster, a contract killer
I'm a convict, a conman, an ex-drug dealer
I'm the bricks man, hitman, jack boy, kick man
Knock your door off the hinges, I hit big licks and
All my people like heaters, we don't like features
We love each other, but we don't like people
We crazy and violent and they can't teach us
Preachers couldn't reach us but the hoes gon' greet us
Cause we balling on you suckers, bitch want more on the bleachers
You niggas real dick riders, male cheerleaders
And you can't compete with Gucci so just follow the leader
Cause I'm still that boy from Zone 6 that might follow your Regal, pussy

[Chorus]
All this cash got me feeling aggressive
All this ice got me feeling aggressive
This drop top Rolls is so aggressive
It got these hoes getting so aggressive
All this ice got me feeling aggressive
All this cash got me feeling aggressive
This drop top Rolls is so aggressive
It got these hoes getting so aggressive

Grrr

[Intro]
It's Wizop
Huh? Huh?

[Verse]
I still don't give a fuck how a fuckboy feel
How you gon' keep it real and your diamonds not real?
I do it so big, I make a hater feel little
I can't tell you why they hating, but I have an idea
You never liked me, probably don't like me still
But a nigga liking me ain't never paid my bills
I'm the realest nigga living, let's get one thing clear
And if you wanna get it popping, we can do it right here
I ain't never been embarrassed, I ain't never felt fear
I got post-traumatic stresses like I can't shed tears
I ain't even been out 6 months, but I spent 6 mil
Got a million dollar grin and a 10 million dollar crib
And my heart done turned burr-burr like my adlibs
In the kitchen going skrt-skrt tryna make a mil
Got these bitches screaming Bling-Blaww, diamonds in my ear
I send my shooters then it's pow-pow, another tatted tear
Yeah it's 2016, so it's Guwop year
When I was 16, I was making drug deals
These niggas say they getting money, I can't really tell
I made more money than them and I was in a jail cell

[Hook]
I'ma say it once again, trust God, fuck 12
A real skreet nigga will never ever call 12
Say it once again, trust God, fuck 12
A real skreet nigga will never ever call 12
Wop, Wop, Wop, Wop

[Interlude]
I'm down on that red, this right here gon' get hard. Gon' get hard. Every day I'm getting fucking harder, I am...

[Outro]
Wop, fuck 12, Wop, fuck 12
Wop, Wop

[Intro]
The left, the left
Leftie, hah

[Chorus]
Please don't make me slap you with the left, the left (Waah)
You a fake so I'm gon' dap you with the left, the left (damn)
I feel like I'm the last real nigga left, the left (It's Gucci)
It's like I'm on an island by myself, the left (Wop)

[Verse 1]
God, please protect me if this shit go left
Cause I can cook a kilo by my God damn self
In the kitchen water whipping with the left
I don't know Redman, but I know who got the meth
I feel like I'm a one-man BMF
Cause I can lock a trap down by myself
You waiting on Gucci to go broke, then hold your breath
This shit ain't cut, it's raw, this shit gon' sell itself
But don't let your right-hand man know what your left hand doing
My homeboys called the cops on me and I ain't even tripping
But how you call yourself a G and hang around snitches?
These niggas going left like crazy, acting like bitches

[Chorus]
Please don't make me slap you with the left, the left (Waah)
You a fake so I'm gon' dap you with the left, the left (damn)
I feel like I'm the last real nigga left, the left (It's Gucci)
It's like I'm on an island by myself, the left (Wop)
Please don't make me slap you with the left, the left (huh?)
You a fake so I'm gon' dap you with the left, the left (well damn)
I feel like I'm the last real nigga left, the left (grrr)
It's like I'm on an island by myself, the left (Wop)

[Verse 2]
Gucci Mane the leftie, pockets so hefty
Wrist so fucking rocky I can't even take a selfie
Right wrist glaring but my left hand glowing
Limping, kicking, pimping like my left leg broken
I offered her two thou, I tried to help her
She took too long to come, that's why I left her
I'm Gucci Mane, I eat millions for breakfast
I came back in a 'Rari like I left some
I'm in a drop top Rolls Royce I feel like I left some
I got like 50 thou on me, who wanna fuck some?
A lot of haters salty, they feel like I left 'em
But all the beefs that Gucci had, Gucci addressed them
Wop!

[Chorus]
Please don't make me slap you with the left, the left (Waah)
You a fake so I'm gon' dap you with the left, the left (damn)
I feel like I'm the last real nigga left, the left (It's Gucci)
It's like I'm on an island by myself, the left (Wop)
Please don't make me slap you with the left, the left (huh?)
You a fake so I'm gon' dap you with the left, the left (well damn)
I feel like I'm the last real nigga left, the left (grrr)
It's like I'm on an island by myself, the left (Wop)

His dope fiend auntie was his baby sitter
Hardhead mama can't do nothing with him
But get on her knees and pray the skreets don't kill him
The skreets don't kill him, then the law gon' get him
Better listen to me kid, it's a fucked up system
Y'all might don't feel him but I damn sure feel him
Cause I was just in a jail cell fucked up with him

[Chorus]
Came up in the hood lil' dirty lil' nigga

Love and loyalty, it's not a day she goes unfaithfully
Cause cain't nobody fuck you like me, yeah it ain't no replacing me
Baby girl, you're more than beautiful, you put your trust in me

Baby, you a goddess and I'm not being dishonest

You worth more than money and you taste sweeter than honey
Your walk is so hypnotic, you erotic plus exotic-xotic
People say I'm trippin' I ain't thankin' bout these bitches
We can share my rise, I give a damn they say I'm trickin'
Super bad bitch I need it, first time I just did it, did it
I can turn you up, I'm filthy, make you laugh I'm super silly
We can hold hands in Lenox
I don't give a damn who with me
These haters need mind their business
Tell the valet bring my Benzes
Please beg my pardon, this not Dolly
I'm the Trap God, she the goddess
Good brain like she went to college
These hoes jellyfish, she can't be solid

[Chorus]
Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body?
Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body?

Metro, Wizop
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm 'gon shoot you

[Verse 1]
I put eight mill' in my crib to inspire ya
When you worth like twenty mill', the kids admire ya
When your rap sheet look like mine, no one will hire ya
But when you sign yourself like I did, they can't fire ya
You want your club so loud then put me on the flier (it's Gucci)
I'm on fire like Richard Pryor, my price gettin' higher
How you gon' take my title, drivin' a car without a title?
I'm whippin' through rush hour Charlotte traffic in a Spyder
Slide up on ya bitch like a race car driver
Dive off in that pussy like a deep sea diver
Niggas from my hood know me from cheap, cheap powder
But niggas on your block say you's a real weak coward

[Chorus]
High five, low five
I left them niggas hangin', they get no five
Gucci Mane, they say that I got nine lives
Six Flags Over Georgia, I got nine rides
High five, low five
I left them bitches hangin', they get no five
Gucci Mane, they say that I got nine lives
Come go to Gucci World, cause I got nine rides

[Verse 2]
Fuck yo jam of the week, I put grams on the street
So much money, gave metro a hundred grand for the beat (Metro)
So much ice around my bezel you can't see, the Patek
I'm Felipe, in Felipe's, with a freak, she petite
From the beach, to the skreet, from the skreet, to the suite
Put my bone in her mouth, told her bon appétit
I done sold so many keys they should deport me to Belize
Cause I'm shining on these niggas like a desert with no trees
From the hat on my head to the shoes on my feet
Every garment on my body, man, it come from overseas
In them 'partments I was raised I sold like 50,000 P's
You want Gucci on your song, that's at least a hundred G's
Wop

[Chorus]
High five, low five
I left them niggas hangin' they get no five
Gucci Mane, they say that I got nine lives
Six Flags Over Georgia, I got nine rides

Gucci Mane, they say that I got nine lives
Come go to Gucci World cause I got nine rides

[Intro]
When I was on drugs so bad, you know, I talked different
I was drinking lean like crazy every day, I was out my mind

[Chorus]
Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Bad bitches, fast cars, weed, and promethazine
Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Diamond chains, assault rifles, skrip clubs, and gambling
Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Fast cars, bad bitches, weed, and promethazine
Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Diamond chains, assault rifles, skrip clubs, and gambling

[Verse 1]
Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Bad bitches, fast cars, weed, and promethazine
Diamond chains, tennis chains, assault rifles, gambling
Sellin' dope and trickin' folks that run in my family
My daddy was an alcoholic, momma she's a junkie daughter
Cousin smokin' crack, I guess she forgot all my aunt done taught her
Plus I got two brothers that I don't know from a addicted father
And all the pain I caused my mother, bet she wish she had a daughter
Sellin' sets out my momma window, tryna' get a new starter
Treat Sun Valley like Decatur, mountain park like port Arthur
I know my family dysfunctional
So God please help these country folks
Tired and broke, in need of hope
Sheetrock, heroin, crack, and coke

[Chorus]
Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Bad bitches, fast cars, weed, and promethazine
Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Diamond chains, assault rifles, skrip clubs, and gambling
Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Bad bitches, fast cars, weed, and promethazine
Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Diamond chains, assault rifles, skrip clubs, and gambling

[Verse 2]
Gucci Mane a local joker, man, that nigga regional (loco)
And people won't be happy til I'm confined to Georgia Regional
The third week out of rehab, man, he forget the shit they teachin' him
Like why you smokin' blunts and sippin' lean and you a millionaire
Wrecked my yellow lamb, high on drugs I didn't give a care
Smashed my black Ferrari two weeks later, now it need repair
Demons in my ear, got me seein' things wasn't even there
People in my circle say they care, but they don't really care
But I can't blame nobody but myself, it starts with myself
Cause rap can bring you wealth, but that wealth can destroy your health
Lookin' in the mirror at myself, had to catch my breath
And tell myself that "Gucci, you an addict!" That's the first step

[Chorus]
Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Bad bitches, fast cars, weed, and promethazine
Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Diamond chains, assault rifles, skrip clubs, and gambling
Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Bad bitches, fast cars, weed, and promethazine
Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Diamond chains, assault rifles, skrip clubs, and gambling
A black bunk bed
Once belonged to me
Body built of sticks and stones and potential energy
I laid alone
On the bottom sheets
So I kept a sense of absence above me when asleep

Singing oh
When I grow
The legacy left to me won't leave me low
Sweet seeds I sow
So memory's remedy's a crumb of hope

I'll be proud to be
Part of me
Probably proud of me
Proud to be
Part of me
Probably proud of me

As a grown clone
Can I be beautiful
Beige as Cali suburbs
Sameness is fatal
Sleep with no doubt
Of who's forgiven you
But can I forgive myself
For being myself, too?
Now
That I've grown
The legacies kept from me have left me low
My only hope's
That younger me is hungry for a sick joke

He's not
Proud to be
Part of me
Probably not
Proud of me
Proud to be
Part of me
Probably not
Proud of Me

You see a broken heart
My baby's 'bout to set me free

I said look, look, look at me
I said what, what, what do you see
I said look, look, look at me
I said what, what, what do you see
You see a broken heart
My baby's 'bout to set me free

I got tears, tears, tears in my eyes
And I got pain, pain, pain in my heart
I got tears, tears, tears in my eyes
And I got pain, pain, pain in my heart
You see a broken heart
My baby's 'bout to set me free

Well just a little bit softer now
Well just a little bit softer now
Well just a little bit softer now

[Verse 1]
Last night, my fantasies become oh-so-true
You said you wanted me as much as I want you
If I said it hadn't crossed my mind
Then, oh baby, I'd be lying
It just got complicated, I don't know what to do

[Pre-Chorus]
Can I get it like that, that, that? Let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know
Can I get it like that, that, that? Let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know, know, know, know

[Chorus]
In my dreams
You say you want me, my body
In my dreams
You say you need me, believe me
In my dreams
You say you love me, say you'll never leave my dreams
In my dreams

[Post-Chorus]
You love me like yeah

You love me right, oh yeah
You love me like yeah
You love me right, oh yeah
You love me like, you love me right
In my dreams

[Verse 2]
Inside I'm screaming loud, I'm calling out your name
It's time you started listening, don't think you can hear me
'Cause if you really wanna go right 'round
Time is tickin', we gotta leave now
Time is tickin', we gotta leave town tonight
Hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Can I get it like that, that, that? Let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know, know, know, know

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah
In my dreams

In my dreams

[Verse 1]
Pulling me further, further than I've been before
Making me stronger, shaking me right to the core
Oh, I don't know what's in the stars
Never heard it from above, the world isn't ours
But I know what's in my heart, if you ain't mine I'll be torn apart

[Chorus]
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now

[Post-Chorus]
Love me now, love me now
Oh, oh, love me now, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Love me now, love me now
Oh, I want you to love me now

[Verse 2]
Something inside us knows there's nothing guaranteed
Yeah, girl, I don't need you to tell me that you'll never leave, no
When we've done all that we could to turn darkness into light, turn evil to good
Even when we try so hard for that perfect kind of love, it could all fall apart

[Chorus]
And who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone?
Oh I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
And I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now

[Post-Chorus]
Love me now, love me now
Oh, love me now, oh, oh, oh
Love me now
Love me now, love me now
Love me now

[Bridge]
Oh I don't know how the years will go down, it's alright
Let's make the most of every moment tonight

[Chorus]
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I just wanna love you now

[Post-Chorus]
Love me now, love me now
Oh, oh, love you now, oh, oh, oh
Love me now, love me now
Love you now
Oh, love you now, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
Hey I might not  really be your mother
That don't mean that I don't really love ya
And even though I married your father
That's not the only reason I'm here for ya

[Pre-Hook: Alicia Keys]
I think you're beautiful
I think you're perfect
I know how hard it gets
But I swear it's worth it, worth it

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love
'cause there ain't nothing, there ain't nothing, there ain't nothing
There ain't nothing I won't do for us
It may not be easy
This blended family, but baby
That's what you do, what you do, what you do

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky & Alicia Keys]
For love, for love
Are you this real my true love
Cause you're my baby, rejoice daily
I believe love could bring us closer than blood

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky & Both]
I remember having four step-moms at nine
Loved Christmas time and birthday was fly
Hit my sister's just for dinner cause the cookin' was bomb
Her mother's supper made me love her like she took me to prom (uh)
And shoutout to my sisters on welfare
Flacko care, nobody else care
And shoutout to the step-sisters and step-brothers
And god-sisters, who eventually slept with us
Real love, but you do it right, alright
I'm here for you
That is alright, alright

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love
There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing, there ain't nothing
There ain't nothing I won't do for us
It may not be easy
This blended family but baby
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love

[Outro: Alicia Keys]
That's just what you do (for love)
For love of the babies (for love)
We're a blended family (for love)
And it's alright (for love)
Said it's alright!
I'll be here forever

Man, I'm young and I'm rich
You prolly mad 'cause your kids keep playin' me
They not gon' stop playin' me
It's Lil Boat, bitch
Suck my dick
Magic mirror, hide your eyes
I think I'm wearing
My new disguise

When it fades
I'm a slave
To you

I hope that you pull through

Magic mirror, I feel strange
I'm bending backwards
In the dusty rain

I will change
But I won't
Be true

This is what I do

[Chorus]
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

[Verse 1]
Why are you blamin' me for all your insecurities?
I never did anything, but you closed the door
Slammed shut on me
Somethin' a little bit bitter that should've been sweet
I won't compete
You're like a king with a crown lookin' down
Hopin' I won't eat

[Chorus]
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

[Verse 2]
Remember what it felt like to start the climb
I'm just like you
Maybe you'll better with time and we'll leave it behind
There's room for two
You should've never done somethin' like that to someone
You can't undo
Thought you were under the radar
But under the chaos, I see through

[Chorus]
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

[Bridge]
I'm hopin' one day you will change
See, everyone ain't the same
We're more than machines
You saw a spark where there wasn't a flame
And you barely remember my name
Do you feel complete?

[Chorus]
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

[Verse 1]
Love ain't just black and white
Ain't that simple
It gets hard to tell who's wrong or right
When It's dark with us
I swear I barely see the light
Should I stick it out?
Are you worth this fight?
Are we worth this fight?
Cuz I ain't no quitter babe
And I be damned if all these years I let you diss me, babe
I was there when no one wanted to stay with you baby
You know I deserve more than this
I do

[Chorus]
So tell me who
Who's gonna love
You like I do
Who will you trust
I gave you too much
Enough is enough
Now we’re in the thick of it
So tell me
Who's gonna love
You like I do
Who will you trust
I gave you too much
Enough is enough
Now we're in the...
Now we’re in the thick of it

[Verse 2]
What a hell of a year
If I make it through hell and I come out alive I got nothing to fear
No more crying and trying
And bring back this loving when nothing is here
Let me be clear
I wasn’t perfect
But this shit ain't worth it
I’m done with the mess
I confess on the stress
And I know Ima look back and call it a blessing
Cuz I ain't no quitter babe
But I be damned if all these years I let you diss me, babe
I was there when no one wanted to stay with you baby
You know I deserve more than this
I do

[Chorus]
So tell me who
Who's gonna love
You like I do
Who will you trust
I gave you too much
Enough is enough
Now we’re in the thick of it
So tell me who
Who's gonna love
You like I do
Who will you trust
I gave you too much
Enough is enough
Now we’re in the
We’re in the thick of it

[Bridge]
Boy you had someone who really loved you
(boy you had someone who really loved you)
Should have held on held on real tight now
(held on tight)
And she placed no other one above you
(and she placed no one above you)
But you didn’t want to treat her right now
Should’ve let her go
Should’ve let her go
Oh no oh, oh no oh
Now I’m letting go
Now I’m letting go
Oh no oh, oh no oh

[Chorus]
So tell me who
Who's gonna love
You like I do
Who will you trust
I gave you too much
Enough is enough
Now we’re in the thick of it
So tell me who
Who's gonna love
You like I do
Who will you trust
I gave you too much
Enough is enough
Now we’re in the
We’re in the thick of it

[Verse 1]
Inside I know
Inside I know
Inside I know
Inside
I got a big, big problem
Coming on me
Oh no

[Verse 2]
She came too fast
I went right past
My hands were cold
Too right to fold
You need me now
I'm not around
I won't connect
Baby
It's just a big, big problem
Coming on me
You know

[Verse 3]
They smile and then they grit their teeth
It's all the reason that you need
You want a hold on something real
You want a pain that you don't feel
I'm wide awake inside my head
She's dry and drowning in her bed
I'm wide awake inside my head
She's dry and drowning in her bed

[Verse 4]
Big problems
Coming on me
Oh

Inside I know
Inside I know
Inside I know

***In progress....

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

[Pre-Chorus]
And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think it should be somethin'
That I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2: Drewsome]
Now lemme start off by saying this
I never let another woman do what you did
And I held myself back from ever talking shit
Cause I swore to always be the bigger man and never diss
But what you've been doing has got me really pissed
So you better stop telling people that we fucking kissed
Cause we didn't and you know that's some middle school shit
All we were was just friends, good friends that it
So for all the times that you told lies about me
Or when you said I was cheating on Sky with Emily
Or even when you lied to about my sexuality
I don't have time to care and I couldn't if I tried
So girl, if your gonna talk shit get your facts straight
And it's a fact that we never went on one date
So if you think I'm still holding on get some help
Cause baby you should go and fuck yourself

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Bridge]
For all the times you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

[Chorus]
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 1]
Have you ever wanna fly?
Have you ever wanna run away?
Have you ever closed your eyes, seen a vision and it took you away
Wonder why in my dreams lookin up the sky is so blue
In the jungle I'm feelin' so free where dreams do come true

[Chorus]
So come on, let's fly away
Like zebras and airplanes
Runnin so free through the night
Fire through the sky away
Like zebras and airplanes

[Verse 2]
Have you ever wanna gallop through the wind where water meets the sand?
If you ever wanna feel like this then come take my hand
Through the paint on the canvass and it cover up your emotion
Now's the time, take a chance, make a wish, let your fantasy begin

[Chorus]
And come on, let's fly away
Like zebras and airplanes
Runnin so free through the night
Fire through the sky away
Like zebras and airplanes

[Bridge]
What do zebras and airplanes mean?
They say zebras running free through the night
Airplanes fly high through the sky
And that can be you and I

[Chorus]
So come on, let's fly away
Like zebras and airplanes
Runnin so free through the night
Fire through the sky away
Like zebras and airplanes

Jumpin' off a rock with my speedos
Get you a check about your ego
I got no time for your ego
When I'm..

[Verse 1: Nas]
The problem's gettin' worse, a modern 1970, Johannesburg
Man, it hurts to see a cop kill a black man alert
News flash, police shoot blacks, distort facts
Quick attack, unarmed men, murder them
It's captured on cellphone video and they still let 'em go
When will they stop killin' 'em? Askin' why is they killin' for?
White man with a gun apprehended, he still alive
Black man with a gun, he has no chance to survive
They gon' shoot him dead soon as they see the brown of his eyes
And they ask me, "Why you ain't smilin' Nas?"
Cause I have a son and I die inside when I gotta tell him what was told to me
Can't play with your water gun son 'cause the police see
A seven years old as a threat
They think it's right to kill a seven years old on sight 'cause he ain't white
So baby if I'm actin' uptight
When our conversation is weak, it ain't you
It's just it ain't that deep

[Hook 1: Robin Thicke]
We could be everything, everything that we ever needed
Everything that we ever wanted to be, we could still be
It ain't that deep, it ain't that deep
(Ah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Ah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
Paradise, sacrifice, what do you want from me?
Pay the price, more than twice, what do you want from me?
When I'm wrong and you're right, what do you want from me?
What do you want from me?

[Pre-Hook: Robin Thicke]
In your eyes, I don't wanna see the pain you're holdin'
If you look in my mind, I don't wanna spend a lifetime for it
It's alright, I don't want to play this over
Living in a world I can't explain

[Hook 2: Robin Thicke]
It ain't that deep, we ain't gotta lose sleep baby
We could be everything, everything that we ever needed
Everything that we ever wanted to be, we could still be
It ain't that deep, it ain't that deep
That, that, that, that, it ain't that deep
That, that, that, that, it ain't that...
(Ah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Robin Thicke]
Tell the truth, was it you? What do you want from me?
Is it you? Are we fools? What do you want from me?
I was in love with you, what do you want from me?
What do you want from me?

[Pre-Hook: Robin Thicke]
In your eyes, I don't wanna stop the fire burnin'
If you look in my mind, I don't wanna see your wheels keep turnin'
It's alright, I don't want to play this over
When I know that you're the one for me
It ain't that deep, it ain't that deep, deep, deep, deep
It ain't that, that, that...

[Interlude]

[Verse 4: Nas]
Suspicion got you livin' in your own prison
You need to leave that alone
Before you sittin' in an old folk's home alone with no visits
So exquisite but mess it up when you're tone's risen
And any day when you don't get your way
Gettin' mad at everything I say
And you don't think it's an emergency
A toupee wearin' liar's tryna run the U.S.A
You makin' our lives harder, you're like the argument queen
There's women out here going hard doing positive things
Slam dunkin' in games, directing movies like Selma
World's startin' to change and you actin' the same
'Cause you don't even see what I see in you
Next female president could even be you
Bringing' kids in the world that we gotta teach
Just give me good sex and give me peace

[Outro: Robin Thicke (Nas)]
It ain't that deep, it ain't that deep
(Nah shawty)
We could be everything, everything that we ever needed
Everything that we ever wanted to be, we could still be
It ain't that, that...

[Intro: Kanye West]
I spit it
I spit it so you could feel it
You know what I'm saying
I'm saying I put my personality into it

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
These hoes is all the same
They all want a nigga hollering out "money ain't a thang"
'Bout pathetic as a player that lost his game
How a motherfuckin' hoe turn a pimp to a lame
See these sheets is like the street you gotta stay strapped up
Cause that's how these hoes'll get you wrapped up
Calling you later saying what she crying about
Put that bitch on now what she lying about
Talking about how she late and how she eat a lot
See she eat a lot cause she smoke weed a lot
Why all the bogus hoes want to front on k
Why the fine hoes can't have one on the way
I prolly tell her to keep it, it'll be our little secret
Boniquan now my shorty looking fine: Puerto Rican
As long as she don't flip it tell her man that we creepin'
What we doin' is all day
When I hang up it ain't called hate its called wait
When you get popped don't call me call Clayton
That's your man ain't it
That's the plan ain't it
When she told me it was mine I damn near fainted

[Hook: Kanye West & Sample]
I told you that I want you
Let em put you on peep it though (That I need you)
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
I’m gonna leave my man today
I just stabbed the first time 'bout a week ago
Let em put you on peep it though (He told me it is so done)
I ain't even want to freak the hoe (So that you know now)
I got your baby on the way

[Verse 2: GLC]
Now these hoes run gun I ain't finna say nothing
She tried to pop my pockets before I even got paid
Don't trip, this bitch was a whip
You could learn something from her but you might get burned from her
We smoked a couple of dimes I hit it a couple of times
Now she say she pregnant and its mine
I'm thinking she was lying by the looks on her face
But she started paging me like every single day
She said her man going away the judge gave him three
Must've thought she was gon' make a fool out of me
To bail this nigga out all she need was a G
Now she must've came to me so I had to change the beat
I said look hoe you must be crazy off that dope
That's when I snatched the rope then I kicked her on the floor
And all that shit I bought you bitch I want it back
You lied to me return of the Mac

[Hook: Kanye West & Sample]
I told you that I want you
Let em put you on peep it though (That I need you)
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
I’m gonna leave my man today
I just stabbed the first time 'bout a week ago
Let em put you on peep it though (He told me it is so done)
I ain't even want to freak the hoe (So that you know now)
I got your baby on the way

[Verse 3: Rhymefest]
All y'all niggas is new with it
I paid my dues with it
Gave hoes abortion loot they bought shoes with it
Say they pregnant who's is it
Tell 'em you did it
Forcing these niggas out of abortion cheese
Paid a couple of hundred now or later more than G's

[?] have a kid by a lame ass broad
I knocked up this girl I barely liked cause she bugged me
She ain't even cute, our baby prolly by ugly
And I ain't happen to have that baby and your stomach doing having that
How much it cost to get rid of it? I give you half of that
But I didn't know that she was on the pill
Needed the money for her hair and her nails
And her cell phone bill
Hoes'll get you its like getting robbed without a pistol
What up on a nigga
Come up on a nigga
Then you wait a month like you not the one cause she ain't got no proof
What happen nine months later when she was telling the truth

[Hook: Kanye West & Sample]
I told you that I want you
Let em put you on peep it though (That I need you)
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
I’m gonna leave my man today
I just stabbed the first time 'bout a week ago
Let em put you on peep it though (He told me it is so done)
I ain't even want to freak the hoe (So that you know now)
I got your baby on the way
I just stabbed the first time 'bout a week ago
I told you that I want you
Let em put you on peep it though (That I need you)
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
I’m gonna leave my man today
I just stabbed the first time 'bout a week ago

[Chorus 2]
I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now

It's all in me
Anything you want done baby

And when it comes down to some good old fashioned love
I got it, I got it
I got it, got it, yeah, yeah

[Chorus 1]
I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally

Russel Hobbs had always put on weight easily, so when he grew sixty times in size swimming to Plastic Beach, he thought it might be his thyroid. Noodle, riding on his back the whole way, guessed it was more likely the six tons of polluted shrimp he'd swallowed en route.

Russel had found Murdoc, but like a circumcision ceremony their reunion was cruelly cut short. Pirates attacked from all sides, so Russell cradled Noodle inside his giant mouth and swam away.

Their trouble, however, was just beginning. Somewhere off the coast of Japan, Russel was mistaken for a whale and harpooned. He managed to wriggle free, but in the fracas Noodle was swept away into the blood-red waters.

Wounded and delirious, Russel struggled on through the ocean, feebly humming the power ballad All By Myself  until he lost consciousness. Eventually, he drifted into the warm waters of the Yellow Sea and washed up on a North Korean beach.

Giant Russel was carted to Pyongyang, where he was exhibited like a modern day Gulliver. The regime's Glorious Leader declared that he'd captured Pulgasari, the legendary North Korean Godzilla. Russel became the country's biggest attraction, and 'I survived Pulgasari' t-shirts became the nation's fastest selling fashion item. Or would have done if people were allowed to sell anything other than manure and tanks.

In time, the North's meagre food rations caused Russel to shrink back to normal size. Realising Russel was just a man, the Glorious Leader proclaimed that he'd personally defeated Pulgasari, and Russel was released. He was given a signed pressing of Kim Sings Sinatra, and sent back to England, where he wandered the streets of London, until musician and Gorillaz collaborator Jeff Wootton let him crash on his futon.

A few days later, Jeff's phone rang - it was Murdoc. Without delay, Russel moved into Murdoc's new West London home.

The band was getting back together.

[Intro: Kanye West]
Niggas can't be serious, man
Yo, yo

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Yo, I'm the reason metal detectors go off the meter
'Cause I'll run through the airport with the heater
Gets the fag at his plane, and if I miss him
Put two in his brain at the baggage claim
Give him... heavy sluggage, tryna get his luggage
Send him to the crossroads, we way too thuggish
Shit, we at odds 'til we even up
'Til you leave on a stretcher or I leave in cuffs
Niggas wanna live, they done breathed enough
And I bet you next time they'll believe in us
It don't take much brains to know we bust things
My gat must bang, through your Mustang
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma ku sa
Niggas seen Kanye, red dotted them
Hurry up, stash the guns, the cops gon' come
And we gon' say we don't know who shot at 'em
Come on

[Chorus: Taji]
All I have is my real niggas (What?)
Get this cash with my real niggas (Come on)
Give my last to my real niggas
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas
All I have is my real niggas
Get this cash with my real niggas (Come on)
Give my last to my real niggas (Come on)
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas

[Verse 2: Cristina Nance]
Y'all niggas ready for war? I'm ready
Easy with the clip, girl, hold it steady
Man I'm 'bout to squeeze back, cock and bust hot lyrics
Cock back, pop, and touch y'all spirits
Send 'em to hell, make their residence more evil
This beat here make me wanna kill four people
Three niggas and one hoe, turn bitches to Jane Doe
Send 'em past rainbows, with the ankles
Hit 'em from all angles, bring the pain though
Blow out the candles, the show's been cancelled
Man, y'all niggas better believe somethin'
'Fore I squeeze somethin' and leave somethin'
It ain't nothin' with my real niggas

[Chorus: Taji]
All I have is my real niggas
Get this cash with my real niggas (That's right)
Give my last to my real niggas (Come on)
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas
All I have is my real niggas
Get this cash with my real niggas (Come on)
Give my last to my real niggas (Come on)
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas

[Verse 3: Mikkey Nance]
I feel like one lady, five babies and four fathers
Six months searchin' for jobs and no offers
No heat 'cept for the stove
Sleep with two layers of clothes, still wakin' up cold
I'm real, like AIDS
Like the pain you feel when your nigga get strained
That's why I got issues like I got pistols
I gotta make your mama cry but I got tissues
I confess, I'm a gangsta
But I drop my flag, still cock back and drop a fag
Leave him in a bag with a tag on his metatarsals
Awfully ill, man, awfully real
Thugged out, but I'm God's property still
And if I up the steel, I'ma probably kill
If not, you're paralyzed from the waist down
Alright dog, you're the king? I'm the ace now
Face down

[Chorus: Taji & Kanye West]
All I have is my real niggas (You know)
Get this cash with my real niggas (Uh)
Give my last to my real niggas (That's right)
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas (For my real niggas)
All I have is my real niggas (That's all I have in this world)
Get this cash with my real niggas
Give my last to my real niggas (Konman Productions)
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas (Brian "All Day" Miller, come on)
All I have is my real niggas (That's right)
Get this cash with my real niggas
Give my last to my real niggas
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas
All I have is my real niggas
Get this cash with my real niggas
Give my last to my real niggas
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas

[Verse 2: 2D]
City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just let it go ‘cause they don't know whack
So all you fill the streets, it's appealin' to see
You won't get out the county ‘cause you're bad and free
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they gotta kiss it, 'cause I don't get sleep, no...

[Hook: 2D & Rich The Kid]
Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is sticking, falling down

When we break up, I swear your lil' spot I ride by
I really love you and didn't even try

Them long legs, I tie them bitches in a knot (Come here, bitch)
I took that bitch in the bando then found her spot (Eat it up)
I whip that dick out like, "Baby suck it or not" (Suck it, suck it)
She ride it like an Australian go-kart
I'm takin' off in that pussy, watch, out the park
She look back like, "Throw them racks and start"
And she said, "I got a bus with bundles of bitches, let's ride"
She want molly, call my supplier
Feed that lil' bitch all the dick and
Make her hit a split, man on the flick, man
Baby all I was sayin' was

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
They said it wasn't a gateway drug
My homie was takin' subs and he ain't wake up
The whole while, these billionaires stay caked-up
Paying out Congress so we take their drugs
Murderers who will never face the judge
And we dancin' to a song about our face goin' numb
But I seen homies turn gray, noses drainin' blood
I could've been gone, off 30's faded in that tub
That's Prince, Michael and Whitney, that's Amy, Ledger and Pimp C
That's Yams, that's DJ A.M
God damn, they're making a killing
Now it's getting attention cause Sara, Katey and Billy
But this shit's been going on from Seattle out to South Philly
It just moved up out the city
And spread out to the 'burbs
Now it's everybody's problem, got a nation on the verge
Take Activis off the market, jack the price up on the syrup
But Purdue Pharma's 'bout to move that work

[Hook: Ariana DeBoo]
My drug dealer was a doctor, doctor
Had the plug from Big Pharma, Pharma
He said that he would heal me, heal me
But he only gave me problems, problems
My drug dealer was a doctor, doctor
Had the plug from Big Pharma, Pharma
I think he trying to kill me, kill me
He tried to kill me for a dollar, dollar

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
And these devils they keep on talkin' to me
They screamin', "Open the bottle," I wanna be at peace
My hand is gripping that throttle, I'm running out of speed
Try to close my eyes but I just keep on sweatin' through these sheets, through these sheets
Four horseman, they won't let me forget
I wanna forge a prescription, 'cause, doctor, I need some more of it
When Morphine and heroin is more your budget
I said I'd never use a needle, but sure, fuck it
I'm caught up, I'm on one, I'm nauseous
No options, exhausted
This is not what I started
Walkin' carcass, I lost everything I wanted
My blinds drawn, too gone to leave this apartment

[Hook: Ariana DeBoo]
My drug dealer was a doctor, doctor
Had the plug from Big Pharma, Pharma
He said that he would heal me, heal me
But he only gave me problems, problems
My drug dealer was a doctor, doctor
Had the plug from Big Pharma, Pharma
I think he trying to kill me, kill me
He tried to kill me for a dollar, dollar

[Bridge: Macklemore]
More, more, more
Re-up, re-up

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Death certificate signed the prenup
Ain't no coming back from this Percocet
Actavis, Ambien, Adderall, Xanax binge
Best friends with the thing that's killing me
Enemies with my best friend, there's no healing me
Refilling these, refilling these
They say it's death, death
Institutions and DOC's
So God grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change
Courage to change the things I can
And the wisdom to know the difference
And the wisdom to know the difference

[Outro]
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh

And we'll take that ride
Across the bloody river
To the other side
41 shots
Cut through the night
You're kneeling over his body in the vestibule
Praying for his life

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Is it a gun? Is it a knife?
Is it a wallet? This is your life
It ain't no secret
It ain't no secret
No secret, my friend, you can get killed just for living in
Your American skin

[Ad-Libs: Mary J. Blige & Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah
Oh yeah
Yeah
Oh-oh

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
If I die right before I wake
Cross my heart, then I seal my fate
Life in the dark of the heartless
Looking at the remedy for all this
Everyday they look at you a target
Falling victim, them and
Him and her then this one, insensitivity
Talk bad religion, skin identity
Lack rash decision made by yours
Pack facility with the urban boy
Gun admitted he bear arm
The entity, arm and leg and head made to destroy
80% of the victim was yours
Maybe I get to relive years of war
Look on the corner, we been here before
Look at the momma, you seen tears before?
Pain bright and early
Rain, sleet, hail, snow, worry
More storm barricade the city
Prosecution, unhung jury
These days murder keep 'em busy
Sweet blood flowed on the gurney
Yellow tape tied around the street
Colin Kaepernick was more than worthy
I could reverse the day, reverse the time
Reverse the block, reverse the gun, reverse the shot
Reverse the law, reverse the flaw
That made us all the versions of a danger flock
Reverse the love, reverse the hate
Reverse the hope, reverse the way we playing sin
Reverse the moment, so we can live again
Life and times of the American skin

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
41 shots

You got to understand the rules (41 shots)
If an officer stops you (41 shots)
Always be polite (41 shots)
And never ever run away
Promise momma you'll keep your hands in sight"

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige (Kendrick Lamar)]
Is it a gun? (What is it?) Is it a knife? (What is it?)
Is it a wallet? (What is it?) This is your life
It ain't no secret (It ain't no secret)

[Verse 1: Jake]
​Our stucco arms are forever tied loose
Your velvet touch sends me back to the moon
Daddy's coming home but momma's looking guilty
Brother's in the basement 'til he's thirty
Wolf child's heavy with the weight of the world
Storing all his love in an adolescent girl
​
​

[Chorus: Jake]
There's sunlight dripping off the apricot tree
Lost to the night tide growing in me
Singing to the drunks like they're mom and dad
All we ever knew is what we didn't have

​

[Verse 2: Jake]
Never really knew if I did something wrong
All I ever heard was "it wasn't my fault" (Oh, oh)
But what good is truth if you don't understand
Nothing but a pair of calloused hands? (Oh, oh)

[Chorus: Jake, Whistler, Zach and Nathan]
There's sunlight dripping off the apricot tree
Lost to the night tide growing in me

All we ever knew is what we didn't have

[Verse 1]
If war is holy and sex is obscene
We've got it twisted in this lucid dream
Baptised in boundaries, schooled in sin
Divided by difference, sexuality and skin

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So we can hate each other and fear each other
We can build these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself locked in, yourself locked in
Yeah we can hate each other and fear each other
We can build these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself locked in, yourself locked

[Chorus]
Maybe we should love somebody
Maybe we could care a little more
Maybe we should love somebody
Instead of polishing the bombs of holy war

[Verse 2]
What if sex was holy and war was obscene
And it wasn't twisted, what a wonderful dream
Living for love, unafraid of the end
Forgiveness is the only real revenge

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So we can heal each other and feel each other
We can break these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself open, yourself open
Yeah we can heal each other and feel each other
We can break these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself open, you open

[Chorus]
Maybe we should love somebody
Maybe we could care a little more
Maybe we should love somebody
Instead of polishing the bombs of holy war

[Outro]
What if love was holy and hate obscene
We should give life to this beautiful dream
Cause peace and love ain't so far
If we nurse our wounds before they scar
Nurse our wounds before they scar

About Eazy...
Tell me how y'all felt, when you heard first that he had.. announced that he had AIDS, and then.. I guess...

When I found he had it, I was twisted. I was torn up for a couple minutes.
Just.. took me by surprise, because he was just with us, you know?
He was just with us, he was just hanging out with us. And I don't -- I didn't see..
I was not expecting to see a stamp saying 'AIDS' all on his body, but I couldn't see the man's signs, you know what I'm saying?
Nothing, not even a sickness, like coughs or nothing.
When I heard that my man was on the death-bed, it shook me up. S'crazy.

The jungle (Oh), I'll take you captive
The jungle (Oh), where danger happens
The jungle (Oh), I'll take you captive

[Verse 1]
Come take a ride with this wild thing, yeah
I'm your tour guide for this wild safari
I'm tryna take you where my heart is, babe
Not like them other journeys, so far from ordinary

[Pre-Chorus]
I can lure you in, I'm so clever with it
There's really nowhere to run, so you can just forget it
I set a trap and ooh, look how I caught you in it
I'm an animal, ani-ani-ani

[Chorus]
You're coming with me, boy, no need to resist
Won't be released until I'm good and finished
Can't let you leave now
So whatever, whatever just won't work
I'm holding you captive, captive (You can't be released)
Holding you captive, captive (I won't let you go)
I'm holding you captive, you captive (You wanna leave)
Holding you captive, you captive, captive (The answer is no)

[Post-Chorus]
The jungle (Oh), where danger happens
The jungle (Oh), I'll take you captive
The jungle (Oh), where danger happens
The jungle (Oh), I'll take you captive

[Verse 2]
Now that I got your full attention
I think it's time you learned your lesson
Locking you up and throwing away the key
And boy, you can forget it 'cause you belong to me, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I can lure you in, I'm so clever with it
There's really nowhere to run, so you can just forget it
I set a trap and ooh, look how I caught you in it
I'm an animal, ani-ani-ani

[Chorus]
You're coming with me, boy, no need to resist
Won't be released until I'm good and finished
Can't let you leave now
So whatever, whatever just won't work
I'm holding you captive, captive (You can't be released)
Holding you captive, captive (I won't let you go)
I'm holding you captive, you captive (You wanna leave)
Holding you captive, you captive, captive (The answer is no)

[Post-Chorus]
The jungle (Oh), where danger happens
The jungle (Oh), I'll take you captive
The jungle (Oh), where danger happens
The jungle (Oh), I'll take you captive

[Bridge]
Go Pussycats, go Pussycats, go (Oh)
Go Pussycats, go Pussycats, go (Oh)
Go Pussycats, go Pussycats, go (Oh)
Go Pussycats, go Pussycats

[Pre-Chorus]
I can lure you in, I'm so clever with it

I set a trap and ooh, look how I caught you in it
I'm an animal, ani-ani-ani

[Chorus]
You're coming with me, boy, no need to resist
Won't be released until I'm good and finished
Can't let you leave now
So whatever, whatever just won't work
I'm holding you captive, captive (You can't be released)
Holding you captive, captive (I won't let you go)
I'm holding you captive, you captive (You wanna leave)
Holding you captive, you captive, captive (The answer is no)
Thought I truly lost myself
No faith in me or anyone else
Lost in the chasms of my soul
Perpetual gloom, no where to go

And then you came
And showed me
A life I'd only dreamed of
Said you came
And loved me
And my soul smiled anew

Thought I'd never write a song again
No inspirations in my life
Melancholy moments play in my mind
Felt my sanity decline

And when you came
And showed me
A life I'd only dreamed of
Said you came
And loved me
And my soul smiled anew

[Verse 1]
She got to shake her little something
(Shake her little something)
Ooh, throwin' that thing from left, right, side to side
She got to have her own money
(She got her own money)
Oh, yeah
Shout out to the girls that pay they rent on time

[Pre-Chorus]
If you ain't here to party, take your ass back home
If you getting naughty, baby, here's my phone
Slide with your boy to the bar
Slide with your boy to the car
I've been searchin' everywhere and now here you are

[Chorus]
Ooh, chunky
Lookin' for them girls with the big ol' hoops
That drop it down in Daisy Dukes

Yeah, them the ones I’m tryna recruit

Yeah, you, baby

[Verse 2]
Now let me hear you say you ready

Oh, yeah

'Cause once we get goin', we rollin'
We'll cha-cha 'til the morning
So just say alright
(Alright)

[Pre-Chorus]
If you ain't here to party, take your ass back home
If you getting naughty, baby, here's my phone
Slide with your boy to the bar
Slide with your boy to the car
I've been searchin' everywhere and now here you are

[Chorus]
Ooh, chunky

Pounds in the trash can, Gucci do the dishes
Don't nobody, nobody fuck with my kitchen
Bought a old school, then I sat it on 6's
How you cop it, how you get it? Plenty working in the kitchen

[Verse 1]
Thirty thousand dollars for the So Icey Squad
Thousand pound deal for the So Icey Boys
Gucci Aquarius a So Icy shark
Selling white chalk tryna duck these narcs
Bought some Lowenharts and some D.U.B.'s
34 inch Ashanti's on the Humvee
Whole lot of purp, whole lot of green
Whole heap of white, large amount of beans
Got them collard greens, sell a lot of things
Four plus a four, dawg, that's a chicken wing
Trapping in a drought, money in the vault
Bring me another pot and another fork
Gucci!

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Aggressive
Hah, grrr, grrr, grrr
Hah, grrrr, it's Wizzop, grrrr, hah
(Zaytoven)

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

All this ice got me feeling aggressive
All this cash got me feeling aggressive
This drop top Rolls is so aggressive

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm Gucci Mane the legend, I don't fuck with you peasants
I'm too heavy to be petty, boy is you balling or begging?
Please stop calling me, nigga, cause I can't spare not a second
I gives a fuck bout a record, I got a criminal record
These boys so scared of big Gucci, they make subliminal records
Most of these rappers is pussy, they making feminine records
It ain't a nigga in the industry that I wanna meet
Your favorite rapper a sucker that's not surprising to me
You can't be talking to the police then try signing with me
I ain't cosigning these niggas, I'm only vouching for me
I ain't letting these soft ass niggas stand on no couches with me
You niggas wasn't in no trap house stacking up ounces with me, pussy

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
All this cash got me feeling aggressive
All this ice got me feeling aggressive
This drop top Rolls is so aggressive
It got these hoes getting so aggressive
All this ice got me feeling aggressive

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Who that at my door, that's Tadoe
Them folks ain't bring the pesos? My day blows
How I turn shit up, yeah the spiggas they blow
Sosa turn shit up, they say he tweaking, they know
Only time I chase is at the bank, ain't got time to chase hoes
NDC I need some poles, meet me at the Fuego's
I take 'em and box 'em up, these hoes I crate those
Ever since my niggas died I'm flexin you know I can't go
Poured up stuntin' I'm gon show out
I took your money it was a no show, ouch
You got the right money, I copped 'em standing on the couch
For these other niggas, no I cannot vouch
All this money, I'm a kangaroo, it's in my pouch
Bitches in my house, tell 'em hoes get out
Hop out, bow down, boy respect me now
You would think that I was Wop, how my wrists bling bow
These pistols sing like Beethoven, Beethoven
This pistol beat like Zaytoven, Zaytoven
What's up in my bank roll? Rainbows
Like Wop and Flash I hate hoes, I hate hoes

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Outro: Gucci Mane]
Grrr

[Verse 1]
I find it hard to say, that everything is alright
Don't look at me that way, like everything is alright
Cuz my own eyes can see, through all your false pretenses
But what you fail to see, is all the consequences
You think our lives are cheap, and easy to be wasted
As history repeats, so foul you can taste it
And while the people sleep, too comfortable to face it
His life so incomplete, and nothing can replace it

[Refrain]
And what I got to say, is rebel
It can't go down this way, not today, rebel
And what I got to say, is rebel
It can't go down this way, rebel

[Verse 2]
And while the people sleep, too comfortable to face it
Your lives so incomplete, and nothing can replace it
Fret not thyself I say, against these laws of man
Cause like the Bible says: "His blood is on their hands"

[Refrain]
And what I got to say, is rebel
It can't go down this way, not today, rebel
And what I got to say, is rebel
It can't go down this way, rebel

[Outro]
Oh are you, oh are you satisfied
Oh are you, oh are you satisfied
Then rebel, then rebel, then rebel, and rebel
Rebel... ohhh rebel
Then rebel, then rebel, then rebel, then rebel
Stand up and live, stand up and live
Stand up and live, stand up and live
Stand up and live, stand up and live
Stand up and live...

[Intro]
Oh, hey

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Winter with the raindrop
You can make the rain stop
You can make the pain stop
Heart pumping, novacaine
Speed through the motor lane
Race to your doorstep, feign for the short thing
Issue that I miss you, wanna kiss you on your neck, aye
Get you then I pin you to the post on your bed, ayy
Feelings turn to a brickwall, there I was
Told me that you got a new love but I...

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Wasted (wasted)
And the more I drink, the more I think about you
Oh no, no, I can't take it
Baby, every place I go reminds me of you

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Do you think of me? Of what we used to be?
Is it better now that I'm not around?
My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know

[Verse 3: Adam Levine]
And every time I go out, yeah
I hear it from this one, I hear it from that one
That you got someone new
Yeah, I see but don't believe it
Even in my head, you're still in my bed
Maybe I'm just a fool

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Do you think of me? Of what we used to be? (What we used to be)
Is it better now that I'm not around? (That I'm not around)
My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know
(Oh hey)

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
No more “please stop”
No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots
No more tryin' make me jealous on your birthday
You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh
Do he do you like this, do he woo you like this?
Do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this?
Matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be
May be his right now, but your body's still me, whoa

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
Wasted (wasted)
And the more I drink, the more I think about you
Oh no, no, I can't take it
Do you think that I should just go on without you?

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh (The way I used to love you)
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know

[Outro]
Oh hey
Oh, oh hey
Oh, oh, oh hey
Uh oh, uh oh

[Skit: Mommy]
That is my greatest fear
That if, if I lost control
Or did not have control, things would just, you know
I would be… fatal

[Verse 1]
I'm writing this letter to let you know I'm really leaving
And no, I'm not keeping your shit
Heard you got some new homies
Got some new hobbies
Even a new hoe too
Maybe she can come help you
Maybe she can come lay do after we're done
What's done is done
I don't want nothing else to do with it
Let me tell you a secret
I've been secretly banging your homeboy
Why you in Vegas all up on Valentine's Day?
Why am I so easy to forget like that?
It can't be that easy for you to get like that
Oh no, she didn't, ooh yes, I did
Oh no, she didn't, I'll do it again

[Chorus]
Leave me lonely for prettier women
You know I need too much attention for shit like that
You know you wrong for shit like that
I could be your supermodel if you believe
If you see it in me, see it in me, see it in me
I don't see myself
Why I can't stay alone just by myself?
Wish I was comfortable just with myself
But I need you, but I need you, but I need you

[Verse 2]
Ooh, just get a load of them, they got chemistry
All they could say, we like brother and sister
Look so good together
Bet they fuckin' for real, and they was right
That's why I stayed with ya, the, the dick was too good
It made me feel good for temporary love
You was a temporary lover

[Chorus]
Leave me lonely for prettier women
You know I need too much attention for shit like that
You know you wrong for shit like that
I could be your supermodel if you believe
If you see it in me, see it in me, see it in me
I don't see myself
Why I can't stay alone just by myself?
Wish I was comfortable just with myself
But I need you, but I need you, but I need you

[Intro: Spoken]
It's like, I just love a cowboy
You know
I'm just like, I just, I know, it's bad
But I'm just like
Can I just like, hang off the back of your horse
And can you go a little faster?!

[Verse 1]
3 am, mustang speedin'
Two lovers, headed for a dead end
Too fast, hold tight, he laughs
Runnin' through the red lights
Hollerin' over, rubber spinnin'
Big swig, toss another beer can
Too lit, tonight, prayin'
On the moonlight

[Pre-Chorus]
Every John is just the same
I'm sick of their city games
I crave a real wild man
I'm strung out on John Wayne

[Chorus]
(dat - doo - deet - doe)
(dat - doo - deet - doe, dat - doo - deet - doe)
Baby let's get high, John Wayne
(dat - doo - deet - doe)
(dat - doo - deet - doe, dat - doo - deet - doe)
Baby let's get high, John Wayne

[Verse 2]
Blue collar and a red-state treasure
Love junkie on a three-day bender
His grip, so hard, eyes glare
Trouble like a mug shot
Charged up, 'cause the man's on a mission
1-2 ya, the gears are shiftin'
He called, I cried, we broke
Racin' through the moonlight

[Pre-Chorus]
Every John is just the same
I'm sick of their city games
I crave a real wild man
I'm strung out on John Wayne

[Chorus]
(dat - doo - deet - doe)
(dat - doo - deet - doe, dat - doo - deet - doe)
Baby let's get high, John Wayne
(dat - doo - deet - doe)
(dat - doo - deet - doe, dat - doo - deet - doe)
Baby let's get high, John Wayne

[Bridge]
So here I go
To the eye
Of the storm
Just to feel your love
Knock me over
Here I go
Into our love storm

[Chorus]
(dat - doo - deet - doe)
(dat - doo - deet - doe, dat - doo - deet - doe)
Baby let's get high, John Wayne
(dat - doo - deet - doe)

Baby let's get high, John Wayne

In this link, you can hear .Paak’s verse for this song

Spits something like this 

[correct if wrong]:

“Front page on the front line
More crime
Shots from the automatic fire
One died
Doc. say it please not mine not mine
Doc said "nothing we could do … no time”

All he ever wanted was a break of some kind
Looking at his reflection gripping that 4-5
Sipping on cough medicine
God bless him
Did a coke line off the dresser then started flexing

Dipping through the avenues of treachery
Misdemeanor misdemeanor felony
Said it “he was ready if he never leave”
And if they wanted beef then it was perfect cause the pedigree
Clutching to a rosary, rolling with the opposition
Running from authorities, feelings and a stolen pistol
Settle down boy they gone get you
YOU RUN AROUND LIKE YOUR TOO OFFICIAL."

[PRE-HOOK COMES IN]

[Verse 1]
Here, there's no music here
I'm lost in streams of sound
Here, am I nowhere now?
No plan
Wherever I may go
Just where, just there
I am

[Chorus 1]
All of the things that are my life
My desire, my beliefs, my moods
Here is my place without a plan

[Verse 2]
Here, second avenue
Just out of view
Here, is no traffic here?
No plan

[Chorus 2]
All the things that are my life
My moods, my beliefs
My desires, me alone
Nothing to regret
This is no place, but here I am
This is not quite yet
You knew just everything
But nothing at all
Now the luminous dark
Feels like pain again
You could feel my breath
You opened my eyes
For I could not see
When I met you

When I met you (Your feelings again)
I could not speak (You're drowning in pain)
You opened my mouth (You're walking in mist)
You opened my heart (You're living again)
My spirit rose (She tore you down)
The marks and stains (It was all the same)
Could not exist (You were afraid)
When I met you
Now it's all the same (Now it's all the same)
It's all the same (It's all the same)
The sun is gone (The sun is gone)
It's all the same (It's all the same)
But when I met you (But when I met you)
When I met you (When I met you)
When I met you (When I met you)
When I met you (When I met you)
When I met you
You were afraid (When I met you)
She stole your heart (When I met you)
You don't understand (When I met you)
You should be ashamed (When I met you)
You should have known (I was the walking dead)
She tore you down (I was kicked in the head)
She tore you down

The edge had become
The centre of my world
The seams of my life
The streams of debris
Neither wounds of a friend
Nor the kiss of a foe
The peck of a blackened eye
An eye for the crowd

When I met you
I could not speak
I met you
Then I met you
My spirit rose (Your feelings again)
My kind of truth (You're drowning in pain)
Could not exist (You are afraid)
When I met you
Now it's all the same (Now it's all the same)
It's all the same (It's all the same)
The sun is gone (The sun is gone)
It's all the same (It's all the same)
But when I met you (But when I met you)
When I met you (When I met you)
When I met you (When I met you)
When I met you (When I met you)
When I met you (You were afraid)
When I met you (She stole your heart)
I was the walking dead (She tore you down)
I was kicked in the head (She tore you down)
It was such a time (When I met you)
It was such a time (When I met you)
I was crushed inside (When I met you)
I was torn inside
When I met you (When I met you)
When I met you (When I met you)
I was too insane (I was too insane)
Could not trust a thing (Could not trust a thing)
I was off my head (I was off my head)
I was filled with truth (I was filled with truth)
It was not God's truth (It was not God's truth)
Before I met you (Before I met you)

[Verse 1]
Empty
Life is nothing like it used to be
People used to be so nice to me
Feeling so empty
Empty
There is nothing deep inside of me
Life is nothing like it used to be
Feeling so empty

[Verse 2]
Life is death
It's because I shot it through its head
I'm wandering around so lazily
And feeling so empty
And now I know
It's because I never set in stone
I'm wandering around so lazily
And feeling so empty

[Chorus]
But I don't feel empty when I'm with you
I feel like you level me too
Who? Empty

[Verse 3]
Empty
There is nothing deep inside of me
Life is nothing like it used to be
Feeling so empty
And now I know
It's because I never set in stone
I'm wandering around so lazily
And feeling so empty

[Chorus]
But I don't feel empty when I'm with you
I feel like you level me too
Who? Empty

[Bridge]
What I got myself into
What I got myself into
Empty

[Outro]
What I got myself into

[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
Come on
Uh, oh, uh
Uh, oh, uh

[Ludacris]
Yo, girl you taste like a Cinnabun
So sweet from the thighs to the cheek
Sex on the beach, check the size of my meat; call me the butcher
Ludacris King Ding-a-Ling sheet smusher
Sweet street pusher, give me that gusher
Nasty stuff - look up - I took her
Ran out of liquor (time to re-up!)
Here comes her nigga (who gives a fuck!)
Rap fame and plat' thangs they can't hang
I mack dames and pack thangs and act strange
Jang-a-ling dang-a-ling oh no they can't stop
Take it to the floor back up and then drop
Effervescent.. time time's of the essence
Make 'em undress in less than three seconds
So whores keep steppin' whores keep slobbin'
Sex as a weapon, clothes that I slept in
Streets keep mobbin', thieves keep robbin'
Get two in yoor butt, three to your noggin
Creepin and crawlin, I'm incogneg'
Can't catch the balls then you in the wrong league
Let a dog breathe, watch a pimp walk
Shut yo' ass up when you hear a pimp talk
Friskier dreams, Krispier Kremes
You lookin mighty fine in them jeans

[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
In dem jeans u got a, fatty girl (uh), fatty girl (oh), fatty girl (uh)

[LL Cool J]
International baller baby
HEESHY! Young birds in the Coupe goin
HEESHY! (Papi tell me if you don't feel me)
Easy; I feel greasy when you squeeze me
(Cut de blood claat talk and do what ya wan' please me)
I'm talkin down home smothered in gravy, Cool J be
Havin young ladies bustin' like 380's
Lubricated silencers, crushin' all challengers
Gats that be claimin they Glocks but really Dillingers
Get it? Glock Dillinger, I'm big you small
More nuts on your face than graffiti on the wall
Hair like Brillo, cuttin up my pillow
Got 'em sayin (hello!) naked in a tub of a Jello
Still no competition, still flow nigga listen
(I'm not supposed to do this type of thing I'm a Christian)
Amen! It's like a scene out of Player's magazine
Let them other cats holla, LL make you scream

[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
In dem jeans u got a, fatty girl (uh), fatty girl (oh), fatty girl (uh)

[Keith Murray]
Yo, this is in thought of those broads who got the goods
To the chicks who don't - ehhhh it's still all good
Some broads got an automatic thickness for eight
You'll soon get it, just stay workin' hard at it
Goodness gracious, good God almighty
You got a badonkadonk, girl don't hurt nobody!
Toes all painted, feet all out
It's an aphrodisiac for the mall without a doubt
Juicy chunky stanky funky
Gut slappin ball slappin cater to your every fantasy
You got your tongue clitoris tits and belly pierced (all that?)
Necklace around yo' waist toe rings - girl do yo' thang!
I mean, in them jeans yo shape is BEAUTIFUL!
And everything is clean cut down to the cuticle
Whoo-wee Jesus JoJo K-Ci and Mary
Girl you don't know what you do to me (lord have mercy!)
Ain't no doubt about it, when she walk by
Tongues hang out, eyes pop out the socket (BING!)
Cats cringe and point like pssh
Ummph you can see that thang from the front
We gas those up like, full service
And, keep 'em drunk like Kathie Lee Curtis
And when you shake it, you rock my world
I done died and went to heaven, you got a fatty girl!

[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
Fatty girl, fatty girl, fatty girl
In dem jeans u got a, fatty girl, fatty girl, fatty girl (Fat as a bitch)
In dem jeans u got a, fatty girl, fatty girl, fatty girl
In dem jeans u got a, fatty girl, fatty girl, fatty girl (Fat as a bitch)

[Verse 1: Elijah Blake]
See I was raised by a preacher man
Who couldn't wrap my brain on religion
But I'll follow you through and through
My mother prayed for deliverance
Cause your touch is far from innocent
But I'll follow you through and through

[Chorus: Elijah Blake]
River wide or valley low
No ocean deep
Baby, I'll be holding on
Give me something to believe
Just like church
There's devotion in you
You're just like
There's devotion in you
You're just like
Hallelujah
Baby, ain't a sin I wouldn't do for you, church
I'll follow you through and through
Just like church
Hallelujah
There ain't a sin I wouldn't do for you, church
I'll follow you through and through
Just like church

[Verse 2: Elijah Blake]
See I was raised by a preacher man
Who couldn't wrap my brain on religion
But I'll follow you through and through
My mother prayed for deliverance
Cause your touch is far from innocent
But I'll follow you through and through

[Chorus: Elijah Blake]
River wide or valley low
No ocean deep
Baby, I'll be holding on
Give me something to believe
Just like church
Hallelujah
Baby, ain't a sin I wouldn't do for you, church
I'll follow you through and through
Just like church

[Bridge: Elijah Blake]
I heard 'em singing now
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Chorus: Elijah Blake]
Baby, ain't a sin I wouldn't do for you

[Verse 1]
She dances in the sheets at nights
She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep
She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school

[Chorus]
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

[Verse 2]
She dances for the man at work
Who works her overtime
She can't be rude as she says
"Sir, I must be home tonight"
She dances to the kitchen stove
Dinner is served by nine
He says his food's an hour late
She must be outta her mind

[Chorus]
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

[Bridge]
She works so hard, just to make a way
For a man who just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains

[Verse 3]
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

[Chorus]
Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

[Verse 1: bearface]
Oh, try to keep your cool
You got a grip, baby
But you just can't seem to fall
You know what we are
Took for granted, fell, we catch ourselves
Don't worry, baby girl
There's no one in the world
But when you say I got a girl
Say it and I know it's killin' you, yeah
When I say you make my knees so weak
Then you know I'm missin' you

[Chorus: bearface]
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl

[Bridge: bearface]
Send me to California
I'm tryna get so lost
Not turnin' up to a 9 to 5
Just wanna know why

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
No plate on a white Lexus
I blacked out on a random cliff
Summer nights, I saw things change
And you still not right to my tick
Pleasure, something
Deep inside my chest
Long nights, long drives
Change across my face
Cowboy, ride it
That's my wild west
Come on babe, you can put it on us
Come on babe, you can put it on me

[Chorus: bearface]
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl
Jumped out of the 2nd floor of a record store
With a Treacherous Four cassette and a cassette recorder
In Ecuador with Edward Norton
Witness the metamorphosis
Of a legend growin' like an expert swordsman
From the Hessian war and
Hence the origin of the Headless Horseman
Born with the endorphins of a pathetic orphan
Endless source and reservoir
Of extension cords in dresser drawers
And deadbolts on the bedroom doors
And sexual torture kits kept in a separate storage bin
Excellent boyfriend

Use intercourse to settle scores
With women who have vendettas towards men
Dickhead is forced in 'til there's shredded foreskin
Reddish torn and they're only bein' fed a portion
Bed sores and sore shins
Pregnant whores can get abortions
Fetish for stickin' metal forks in, self-absorption
Skeletor, I went to Hell and fell a floor
A predator, I'm headed for competitors
Better warn 'em, what I lack in tact and a set of morals
I make up for in metaphors like a cosmetic store
Stegosaurus, Chuck Norris with a thesaurus
Yes, of course, a mess of warrants
You want some? Come and get some, boys!
I'm givin' Daniel Pantaleo a refresher course
On excessive force and pressure points
And dressin' George Zimmerman in a fluorescent orange
Dress and four inch heels to address the court
With a bullseye on his back, his whole chest and torso
Are left on the doorsteps of Trayvon's dad as a present for him
In my present form I'm Desert Storm
Appetite for destruction there's no suppressant for
Aggressive, forceful, and less remorseful in every morsel
Unpleasant, horrible; hello, gorgeous!
The rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus
Met a contortionist, said, "When you wanna get sexual?"
She said, "However I fit in your schedule. I'm flexible."
Expired tags on the Saturn, got Catherine Bach
In the back in Daisy Dukes with the hazards on
At a traffic stop gettin' harassed, sign an autograph
For this asshole cop's daughter
Laugh 'cause I called her a brat on it
He spat on it and brought it back lookin' half in shock
Had a heart attack and dropped dead
Started fallin' back with it
And got slapped with a Colin Kaepernick practice sock

One ball and half a dick, Apple Watch
Crack front axle, walked in a Bass Pro Shop with David Hasselhoff, pulled Tabasco sauce out of my satchel
Knocked over a fisherman's tackle box and *crash sound*
Asked if they had a laugh in stock
That was fuckin' stupid…

You got it twisted, all 'cause I offered this bitch
A doggie biscuit, you call me misogynistic
Bitch, get to massagin' this dick!
Like spas in this bitch, slob on it with gobs of lipstick
Got a shoppin' list for you to run some odds and ends with
There's not a bitch on this earth I can be monogamous with
She's non-existent
Robin Thicke with a throbbin' dick on some suave and slick shit
But I shout derogatives at bitches like fuckin' missile launches
Misfit, blond and nitwit
Like I've gone ballistic, with a frostin' tip kit
Screamed, "I hate blondes," and became one, I'm optimistic
Love to start shit
Shovin' Clark Kent's undergarments in the glove compartment
Of the bucket, bumpin' Bubba Sparxxx
I'm double parkin' up at Targets, trouble causer, a double crosser
Shadiest mothafucka you'll ever come across
Olympic gymnast, been known for some assaults
A couple lawsuits, enough to cause a stomach ulcer
Same damn brain scan results as Rainman's is
Something's off, but when Dustin Hoffman's
Dressin' up in your mummy costume
On stage dancin' to "Brain Damage," what's the problem?
Nothing's wrong, the name brand is back to reclaim status
Run the faucet, I'ma dunk
A bunch of Trump supporters underwater
Snuck up on 'em in Ray-Bans in a gray van with a spray tan
It's a wrap, like an ACE bandage
Don't-give-a-fuck persona, to my last DNA strand
E&J in the waistband, at the VMAs with the stagehand
She wants kielbasa, pre-arrange an escape plan
Three-inch blade on point, like a See-and-Say
Consider me a dangerous man
But you should be afraid of this dang candidate
You say Trump don't kiss ass like a puppet
'Cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin'
And that's what you wanted
A fuckin' loose cannon who's blunt with his hand on the button
Who doesn't have to answer to no one—great idea!
If I was president, gettin' off is
The first order of business, once I get in office
Second thing that'll make me happy's walkin' up to Uncle Sam
Naked, laughin', dick cupped in hand
Screamin', "Fuck safe sex!"
Throw a latex and an AIDS test at him
Tell Congress I run this land
And I want the rubber banned, and make it snappy
Addiction to friction and static
Addict who can't escape the habit
Continue to chase the dragon
But as fate would have it, I walked up in Major Magics
Dressed as the maintenance man
In a laser tag vest and a racin' jacket
With a gauge to blast it
And sped away in the station wagon
Stacey Dash's and Casey Anthony's
Crazy asses in the backseat
Throwin' Stayfree pads at me
Dead passenger in the passenger seat
Unfasten the safety latches
And slam on the brakes in traffic so hard
I snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires
'Finna get a murder case and catch it
Like you threw it at me encased in plastic
And send Dylann Roof through the windshield of the Benz
Until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin'...
Like a windmiller with a thin build while his skin's peelin'
And skids 'til he hits a cement pillar
Swing for the fence like Prince Fielder
Knock it into the upper peninsula
You wanna go against 'zilla? The Rap God
When will I quit? Never been realer
The in-stiller of fear, not even a scintilla of doubt
Whose pen's iller than Prince in a chinchilla
Or Ben Stiller in a suspense thriller
Revenge killer, avenge syllable binge
Fill a syringe, 'til I
Draw first blood
Even pop shit on my pop shit, and it's popular
Couldn't be more awkwarder
'Cause your innocence I robbed you of
It's my fingers that got stuck up
Taught ya ta not give a
Slapstick, hockey puck
The broad hunter with the sawed off
Like an arm when it's lopped off of ya
But I'm not gonna get the shotgun
Or Glock, I'ma opt for the ox
Cause I'm into objects that are sharp when I shop
And it's not a shock, I'm such an obnoxious fucker
The Rock Hudson of rock 'cause who would have thought
This much of a cocksucker to go across the buttocks of Vivica Fox with a box cutter
That was for 50, little slap on the wrist be warned
I'm unravelin' quickly
My squabbles, I'm grappling with your time traveling with me
Try and follow, as I wobble, relapse into history, with a flask of the whiskey
Tip it back then I'm twisting wine bottles
Like what happened to Chris Reeve's spine column
That's the plan of attack when I'm fixing my problems
Wish my chest wasn't having to get these rhymes off 'em
But the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles
And why I haven't come back on these faggots who diss me is
More of a spectacular mystery than a fucking Agatha Christie crime novel

But my patience is wearing thin
Swear I been contemplatin' rubbing shit in your face 'til I smear it in
Diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen
And never appear again
If you actually had fuckin' careers to end
But then I think of Molly Qerim and I steer 'em in that direction and forget my ideas for them
Molly, I'm gone off you
Man, light some kush
You're my first take, I'll nail you
Can't lie, I gush
If I won you over, you would be the grand prize
I'm entranced by your looks, come and give the Shady franchise a push
You can get it in the can like some Anheuser-Busch
Jeans too small, least three pant sizes tush
Mushed against your damn side, your puss
And thighs are squished
What kind of attire's that?
I'm ready to be rode
Psychopath, bet you we'll get it poppin' like a flat
Light the match to ignite the wrath
Got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in halves
Piper Chapmans might just have to picket me
Like a scab
Hard to describe in fact
Startling violent perhaps
Are things that come to mind as soon as I start spitting rhymes like that
And you aren't really surprised at that
But as far as these lines I rap
And these bars, wouldn't dial it back if I star 69ed the track

Why am I such a dick?

[Chorus]
Baby, if you want me to be
I can be your new fantasy
Love me hard and fulfil my needs
Don't you want to have SXWME?
Baby, if you want me to be
I can be your new fantasy
Love me hard and fulfil my needs
Don't you want to have SXWME?

[Intro]
I said my lady
Say yeah
Say ooh yes
Ye ye yes

[Verse 1: (Kev Nish + Prohgress)]
The sexiest thing I've ever seen
No filter thighs, smoking like Nicotine
Tryna stretch you out like a limousine
Sex on fire, spread the lotion like kerosene
Girl, you I know I stay with it, wet up like bidet with it
Body like a playground, time to foreplay with it
Kill it, get away, like that first 48
She relate, no escape, build a case and i still stay in it
Lady take off
High sex drive got your boy speeding with the brakes off
Burn that cake off
Turn that thang raw
You my main line, give you FaceTime
Bout' to break it down with the cape off
Bout' to pass it to the homie like she down with Nate Dogg
Blowing up the hood that little mama napalm
Got me callin in the morning till the till the break of dawn
Little sip of henny and it’s on

[Chorus]
Baby, if you want me to be
I can be your new fantasy
Love me hard and fulfil my needs
Don't you want to have SXWME?
Baby, if you want me to be
I can be your new fantasy
Love me hard and fulfil my needs
Don't you want to have SXWME?

[Verse 2: Jay Park]
Look, I love you harder than a rock girl
The moon shining like the diamonds on my watch girl
I love your bottom so let’s take it from the top girl
Red light district, but don’t let that stop you
There ain’t nothin' wrong with a little bump and grind
Yeah we be up all night fuckin’ til’ the sun come up
Girl lemme break your walls, like I was a juggernaut
Girl that's the Renaissance what I do is a work of art
Let’s get lit off the champagne
Turn off yo' phone who cares what yo' man’s sayin’
Get nasty like the old LL
We'll be doin’ it and doin’ it and doin’ it well
Play with it, lemme watch ya'
Notorious when I’m in the sauce
I gotta gun between my legs, i'm bout' to shoot up yo' place
Cause I love it when you call me Big Poppa

[Chorus x2]
Baby, if you want me to be
I can be your new fantasy
Love me hard and fulfil my needs
Don't you want to have SXWME?
Baby, if you want me to be
I can be your new fantasy
Love me hard and fulfil my needs
Don't you want to have SXWME?

[Bridge]
Now can i get nasty baby?
I wanna spread your legs open wide
And lick you up
And lick you down
I said lick you up
And lick you down
Now I’m gonna turn your body over
Make you scream over and over, yeah
I can give it to you
I can give it to you
Give it, give it, give it to you

[Chorus]
Baby, you want me to be
I can be your new fantasy
Love me hard and fulfil my needs
Don't you want to have SXWME?
Baby, you want me to be
I can be your new fantasy
Love me hard and fulfil my needs
Don't you want to have SXWME?

[Intro riff]

[Verse 1]
I staggered through this criminal reign
I'm not in love, no phony pain
Creeping through this tidal wave
No warm embrace, just a lover's grave
This symphony
This rage in me
I've got a handful of songs to sing
To sting your soul
To fuck you over
This furious reign

[Hook]
I'm falling, man
I'm choking, man
I'm fading, man
I'm the broken line
I'm falling, man
I'm choking, man
I'm fading, man
Just killing a little time

[Verse 2]
I love the sound of an empty room
The screams of night, the end of love
Two beating hearts, one labored start
One open wound, wasted and drawn
No sympathy
This furious reign
I lay in bed
The monster fed, the body bled
I turned and said
"I get some of you all the time
All of you some other time"
This rage in me
Get away from me

[Hook]
I'm falling, man
I'm choking, man
I'm fading, man
I'm the broken line
I'm falling, man
I'm choking, man
I'm fading, man
Just killing a little time

[Outro]
This symphony
Get away from me

[Intro]
If you got something good, don't take it for granted
Hear me

[Verse 1]
It's time I learn a lesson from my drama
With the wall of this so that you don't have to feel the pain
I just gotta tell you
That one man's loss is another man's gain, yeah

Now you're the type to take your girlfriend, for granted
You should treat her like the finest thing on this here planet
And I know you're gonna wanna hit him
The minute that you see her with him

[Refrain]
'Cause you got caught slippin', slippin', slippin', slippin'
Now your girl's gone missin', missin', missin'
Now you're all alone wishin', wishin', wishin'
That there was something you could do, she's with him because you got caught slippin'

[Verse 2]
Woah, how soon my brothers we forget, yeah
All the things we did just to get her
All the game that we spit, all the flowers
Phone conversations for hours
Now we don't talk that long
And the lovemaking ain't that strong
Feeling like, she doing something wrong
('Cause you and I know)
She's moving on 

[?] gotta be strong
All because you were slippin

[Refrain]
'Cause you got caught slippin', slippin', slippin', slippin'
Now your girl's gone missin', missin', missin'
Now you're all alone wishin', wishin', wishin'
That there was something you could do, she's with him because you got caught slippin'

[Break]

Miss you, babe
I want my baby back
All because you were out slippin'

[Refrain]
Slippin', slippin', slippin'
Now your girl's gone dippin', dippin', dippin'
Now you can't trip (cause you did it too), trippin', trippin', trippin'
No you regret it, you can dish it
But you can't take it

[Intro: Macy Gray]
Oh, and I'm a forever survivor

[Verse 1: Macy Gray]
Sometimes the road ain't that easy
And honey, all money ain't the same
I guess that love ain't that sleezy
And sometimes the crowd ain't that loud
Seems like the years fly away
But I find it strange when times get harder
I will survive another day

[Chorus: Macy Gray]
Reach the sky, the smell the roses
I will play for you like it's my last show
I'm a forever survivor, forever survivor
So much stronger, so much wiser
It's the power that's inside me
Forever survivor, forever survivor

[Post-Chorus: Macy Gray]
And I wanna tell ya
I wanna shout
I wanna scream it out loud
Forever survivor, forever survivor

[Verse 2: Macy Gray]
Maybe the storm will never end
Maybe my heart was meant to break
If I get tomorrow, I'll try again
I'm gonna  find a better way
Tie up my shoes to keep from fallin'
I'm countin' every step I take
Walkin' ahead until I'm found
I will survive another day
I'm a survivor, survivor, I'm a survivor
F-f-forever, f-f-forever, f-f-forever, f-f-forever, survivor

[Chorus: Macy Gray]
Reach the sky, the smell the roses
I will play for you like it's my last show
I'm a forever survivor, forever survivor
So much stronger, so much wiser
It's the power that's inside me
Forever survivor, forever survivor
Forever, forever
Forever survivor, forever survivor

[Post-Chorus: Macy Gray]
And I wanna tell ya
I wanna shout
I wanna scream it out loud
Forever survivor, forever survivor

[Outro: Macy Gray]
Forever
I'm a survivor
I am forever
I'm a survivor

[Intro: MIKNNA]
Going out every weekend
Spending all of my money
Now that I'm alone
I ain't got no time for lovin’
Ooh oooh I don't know what to do with myself
Ooh oooh I don't know what to do with myself
(Don't know what to do, I don't know what to do)

[Chorus: MIKNNA]
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T]
I'm talking dolla dolla dolla dolla bill
She fuck for free, I tried to feed her, bring that beer
I'm never drinking, that's some shit that I ain't used to
But if they throw that pussy at you, what would you do?
I gotta knock it down like I do to Caddy doors
I gotta flip it like screens when I'm on fours
I told her get down and get down on the floor
The type of freak 

[?], you never know
We on that layer, tryna pair us, force us on the slash
Owing to the lights, the whip look so dramatic
Why dodging it, dance, speeding through the traffic
To get home and bust these bands on that ass
Big bang bro, we flexin' it to the max
Money make her come, she don't know how to end
If it ain't fucking bitches that gettin' straight through the wealth
Shawty, I don't know what to do with myself
Krizzle

[Chorus: MIKNNA]
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money

[Verse 2: Far East Movement]
Living on airplane mode
Never wanna change with the LA flow
Different shoes different legs through the valet doors
Put you on the payroll not your everyday hoes
Private with the pimpin keep it tinted Benzo
Fuck bitches, get riches be the fuckin M.O.
Cause I innovate, I don’t play with imitate dough
Stay cuttin’ mad fishes up Hattori Hanzo

[Far East Movement]
Flippin' scales, sippin' pales
Robbin bad bitches blind, watch me fingerbang in Braille
Pin the tails, yo I never fail
Gimme one night with the fatty, kill the kitty, then I wish it well
Playa by the code, feed ‘em thru the nose
White bitches diggin’ like an interview in Vogue
Frosted with the cinnamon, I'm fuckin’ witcha both
Four queens with the king make a muthafucka fold

[Pre-Chorus: MIKNNA]
Going out every weekend
Spending all of my money
Now that I'm alone
I ain't got no time for lovin’
Ooh oooh I don't know what to do with myself
Ooh oooh I don't know what to do with myself

[Chorus: MIKNNA]
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money

[Verse 1]
You’re playing shy, don’t think that I don’t wanna be
Treading 'round you carefully, I don’t play games
I don’t play, don’t care to know your name
I just want you for tonight, I wanna dance
All night in L.A, I'll make your advance
We run like it’s payday, there’s crazy tension in the air
Think we should start a love affair

[Pre-Chorus]
Breathe, don’t speak
Why don’t you come and dance with me?
Get weak, the beat'll leave you lost, just screamin’
Oh-oh oh-oh, someone help me, oh-oh oh-oh
The people help me scream it, breathe, don’t speak
Why don’t you come and dance with me?
Get weak, the beat'll leave you lost, just screamin’
Oh-oh oh-oh, someone help me, oh-oh oh-oh
Someone help me

[Chorus] (x2)
Don't you people leave with me
Don't you people leave with me
Don't you people leave with me
Don't you people leave with me
People leave us screamin'

[Verse 2]
I’m alive, this love is bound to last past five
We won’t get out until the night, I wanna play
Tonight ain’t over yet, don’t know your name
Ain’t nothing to regret, I wanna dance
All night in L.A, I'll make your advance
We run like it’s payday, there’s crazy tension in the air
Think we should start a love affair

[Pre-Chorus]
Breathe, don’t speak
Why don’t you come and dance with me?
Get weak, the beat'll leave you lost, just screamin’
Oh-oh oh-oh, someone help me, oh-oh oh-oh

Sound M.O.B

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Woo!
I'm on my way to an island and I'm poppin' shit at the pilot (Fly shit only)
Niggas be broke and be starvin' but still talkin' shit like they violent (Niggas is broke!)
They said that they honest, talk money, these niggas gon' say that they got it (Huh?)
Gettin' out with the key to success and these niggas gon' blame it on Khaled
They don't wanna see you win (They don't!)
They don't wanna see the Wraith (No!)
You don't wanna see your bitch caught up in the stars like she outer space
Mansion at the condo, condo at the mansion, and I'm runnin' out of space
Tell your homie, keep on comin' out his mouth, I'm sendin' somethin' 'round his way (Brrt)
Niggas barely getting lawyer money (Woo)
Better get some Sig Sauer money
Running 'round like you Superman, don't be selfish, get your mom insurance money (Ha!)
Woo, 'cause I'm the one to put it on your money
I'm the one that make it happen it to you niggas, would you fuck around and do it for me?

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again
Fly out a bitch from the tropics, get litty again
All of my parties is poppin', you know that we litty again
All of the foreigns on Collins, you know that we litty again
They don't wanna see the squad (We lit)
They don't wanna see the Wraith (We lit)
They don't wanna see your bitch up in the stars like she goin' outer space
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we litty again (We lit)
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we did it, we litty again

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Feature money out the safe, went and brought a Wraith, brought it down Collins
Niggas talkin' like they want it, when we in the city, they don't want problems
Niggas said they gon' rob us
But nigga, we comin' from welfare
I shoot a mullet when I pull it, how you catch a bullet like a NFL player?
Should've known it was litty when bitches start lyin' on my dick
Lie on that pussy like I hit
Can't even be a side, side bitch
I'm hittin' 9s, 10s, and you ain't even looking like you a 5
Broke bitches tryna do it for Twitter, when they used to do it for Vine, woah!
I'm the man of the hour, I'm the nigga with the airtime
Rolls Royce Wraith, put your bitch up in the stars like she in the airline
Niggas talkin' 'bout my hair line, I laugh about it, I be feelin' them
See, we both be making M's: they be makin' memes, I be makin' millions
I just counted up a Quentin Miller
A "QM", that's a quarter milli
They don't wanna see Jae drop "6," fly private when he go to Philly
Funny money, yeah I know it's silly, but your ho feel me
When I pull up and I got a pour a whole four on it
I promise she gon' know it's litty, motherfucker, yeah

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again
Fly out a bitch from the tropics, get litty again
All of my parties is poppin', you know that we litty again
All of the foreigns on Collins, you know that we litty again
They don't wanna see the squad (We lit)
They don't wanna see the Wraith (We lit)
They don't wanna see your bitch up in the stars like she goin' outer space
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we litty again (We lit)
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we did it, we litty again

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
All of my niggas is way up
These niggas is haters, I know that they haters (Suckers)
I score your bitch like a layup (Score)
I make a mil' like a layup (More)
I pop a pill just to stay up (Woo)
I sip the lean just to slow it up (Slow it up)
I'm with my team, and we goin' up (Goin' up)
All of these foreigns, they know it's us (Ah!)
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Like the coca when we mix the soda up (Whip it)
Perfect timin' and we're blowin' up (Blowin' up)
Fuck it, I'ma light the Rollie up (Rollie up)
Shorty fuckin' for Chanel!
I ain't trippin', that's a coconut (Coconut)
Push the 'Rari 'til the motor bust
Stack the paper, fill the sofa up (Woo)
Lay on that paper, I am not slackin', I stay on that paper
I feel like it's a restraining order on that money, 'cause y'all stay away from that paper
I know some niggas that used to be ballin', but know they all feeling a way 'bout this paper
I be spending hundred, hundred, hundred after hundred
They thought I was makin' this paper!
Fuckin' it good, I be rapin' this paper
Shit, I might as well get married to money
I marry Nicki, still married to money
She rich as Mariah, I carry the money
And fuck a deposit, I bury the money (Bury them M's)
I bag the money, it hang out my pocket, embarrassin' money
I act like I ain't used to havin' this money, oh!

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again
Fly out a bitch from the tropics, get litty again
All of my parties is poppin', you know that we litty again
All of the foreigns on Collins, you know that we litty again
They don't wanna see the squad
They don't wanna see the Wraith
They don't wanna see your bitch up in the stars like she goin' outer space
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we litty again
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we did it, we litty again

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah, this that "just got to a half a brick" music
Young nigga, putting lobster in the Oodles of Noodles

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
When I walk up in this bitch, they turn the lights out
All the young niggas with me and they iced out
I had to stack it up and get my mom a nice house
I could've did the Wraith, instead I brought the bikes out

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
We never live for tomorrow, new half a brick in the car
Rich and my chick is a star, I never wish on a star
Pull up and sit on the car, 'member when we used to starve
Most of these niggas is frauds, they not who they said that they are
Niggas do it for the Internet
We ain't really really into that
Push a foreign but you rented that
Shoot a scene, gotta give it back
Took a loss on a lil cash
I ain't trip about it, had to get it back
Move work like SlimFast
Niggas in and out it with a fifty pack
Plugged in with the plugs, spikes on with the blood
Fell back, got the Balmains 'cause the pockets only fit a dub
That was never what it was, I'ma tell it like it is
Bust down with the sig, whole gang with me on the way to LIV

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
When I walk up in this bitch, they turn the lights out
All the young niggas with me and they iced out
I had to stack it up and get my mom a nice house
I could've did the Wraith, instead I brought the bikes out

[Verse 2: Don Q]
Every nigga with me iced out
Diamonds dance when the lights out
I just upgraded my lifestyle
Overnight and they like, "How?"
I treat my whip like a pet
I step on the gas and you hear the pipes growl
I got like twenty on me at the car wash
Got the Benz getting wiped down
Diss records, keep my name out it
I promise you won't get no fame out it
Driving by certain trap houses
Reminiscing when I used to sling out it
My life was excitin', all of this ice on
You catch me in Dyckman, I make it look easy
They hate when they see me, I'm high on the Deegan
I'm speeding with Meeky and chasing the 'ghini
When you broke, you just feel abandoned
Crowd screaming and I hear 'em chant
Watch me steer the Phantom when I'm in the Hamptons
Same crew since when I was wearin' Vans
It's show time when the gang appearin'
Niggas hating but the bitches starin'
Who would think that I'd get a mansion?
Twenty chains in the mirror dancin'

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
When I walk up in this bitch, they turn the lights out
All the young niggas with me and they iced out
I had to stack it up and get my mom a nice house
I could've did the Wraith, instead I brought the bikes out

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
New crib with the elevator
I got hella haters and they mad at me
Up in Niemans, going bad at it
Count it up like it was mad madness
'Member back when I was dead pop
Pretty bitches used to laugh at us
Now I pull up in the red drop
With the thirty on me and the red dot
And I lean on 'em when I come through like, "Swerve" (Skrt Skrt)
Rat niggas up the street, shit, I'm like, "They got some nerve" (Pussy)
Every nigga 'round me look like they got them birds (Lit)
Bust down, Big Meech, nigga, we ain't sweet beef, we purge

[Verse 4: Don Q]
I bet your manager know me, I used to run in them spots
We was just punching the last four, you was just punching the clock
I just got rid of my last whore, then I gave her mother a shot
Pour up, I'm down to my last four, and I fill my cup to the top
To my hood, I'm an icon, watching out for the pythons
10K on the left wrist, another dub on my right arm
I still come and spend nights on corners niggas took lives on
And they ain't lackin', believe me, they packin'
My youngins, they keeping they pipes drawn

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
When I walk up in this bitch, they turn the lights out
All the young niggas with me and they iced out
I had to stack it up and get my mom a nice house
I could've did the Wraith, instead I brought the bikes out, yeah

Ever since I came out (uhh) I been handin' pain out (uhh)
Fold a wire hanger through your nose, take your brain out
Hey now, on the stage, I'm like great balls of fire (uhh)
One more year, I'll be on Lake George retired (just one)

And when I die
Make sure you spread my blood on a BMW
And when I die

Microphone attached to my head so I can dance my little heart out
Don't make me bring the white guitar out
Like the one in Wayne's World, that was shinin' in the window
Since 13, I been a nympho, uhh
Fuck, That's Delicious on box set
Me and my mans smokin' on big drugs and feasting on the ox leg
Stand in the store with twenty Ahmed's (a-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!)
Bazookas on shoulders, hundred pounds of C4 in a stroller
Z4s roll up, shit's cold, I think I need a ricola
I just dropped a million kroner, I'm a stoner (uhh)
You lack culture, I'm a psychedelic image of a black vulture
Trapped inside a past soldier, uhh (It's me)

Baby, this Christmas

All my thoughts and prayers askin' of you
Well guess what, baby: I've got some good news

Make love to you everywhere
I'm so excited I'm comin' home for Christmas

[Verse 1]
Everybody gotta love each other
Throwin' spears at your sisters and your brothers
Man, it wasn't that long ago we were all living in the jungle
So why do we gotta-
Why do we gotta put each other down
When there's more than enough love to g-g-go around?

[Chorus]
Come to mama
Tell me who hurt ya
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out

[Verse 2]
Dude in a lab coat and a man of God
Fought over prisms and a forty-day flood
Well, I say that rainbow did more than they've ever done
So why do we gotta
Why do we gotta fight over the spheres
When there's more than enough g-going on down here

[Chorus]
Come to mama
Tell me who hurt ya
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out
Oh, come tomorrow
Who are you gonna follow?
Don't wanna see

And never came down

[Verse 3]
Psychic stoner catches minnows in the harbor
Everyone tells him he should work a little harder
They all believe that freedom is a bitch
But baby, he's already got her
So why do we gotta
Gotta believe that there's only night more to live
The only prisons that exist are ones we put each other in

[DMX:]
You know what's crazy?
I never saw Biggie smile, until after he died.
And then I saw him smile in Hypnotize.
I was like "Oh shit!"
Like, the smile brings a whole 'nother light to your -- to your.. --face, like..
I mean, it's kinda hard to explain, I'm really good with words, but like, it's hard to explain what a smile does for a person. Because, you don't just smile with your.. with your mouth.  You smile with your eyes, like, you know, like a true smile can be seen even if a person's covering their mouth. You see the, the joy in their eyes. And you know, I saw that and I was like "wow", like "wow man, he was really enjoying his life and it got taken away from him." So, it was then that I cherished the smile. It was then. "Wow -- wow, thank you for that." I never realized that that was the moment that I cherished the smile until I saw Biggie smile, like,  this, "Hard, nigga, brooklyn, Who Shot Ya, like, yeah nigga get it get it!" And, then he was like smiling on the boat like..
imitating Hypnotize music video
"Oh shit, yo!"
It made you wonder like, "oh he's enjoying his life man!"

[Interviewer:]
Do you have any memories of Biggie that speak out to you?

[DMX:]
I only met him once.

[Interviewer:]
Tell us about that.

[DMX:]
Uhm.,.
Well, you know the LOX got signed before I did, even though I bought the LOX songwriters. You know, they got signed, they were a safer group, you know, Puff signed them. And it was a blessing and a curse, 'cause they were happy about getting signed first and being on the Benjamins and shit was going.. then they made them jiggy and put them in suits and.. and made 'em..  made them write  lyrics for 'em and took all that publishing and.. raped them. Like, "Damn, I'm glad I didn't".. you know? like.. You can keep that.  And we went to like -- So it was when they got signed, Dee was like 'yo, if you like The LOX, like, X is like, like, big dog, those are the pups, like you'll love him!' And one thing I respect about Puff, he told me to my face. Like "ehh, his voice is too rough, he's not marketable.." -- man, what you gonna do with that? You gotta respect that. You can't be mad like "what do you mean", you know, like, fuck dude, he told the truth, okay cool.
But um.. When the deals got on the table, he came back like "yo,I'll double whatever they gave you, and I'll lace your pockets". I'm cool homie. Pfft. If you didn't know what I was then, you just pretty much jumping on the bandwagon now, like, you don't know, like you- you- you still clueless on who I am or how to fuck with me. So, like, you're supposed to see that diamond shining a long time ago, like, you know, if you really that nigga you s'posed to see it like "oh, that's a diamond!"

[Verse 1]
Yeah, bitch I'm back
I'm back again
I'm feeling good, better than I ever been
It's West side 'til a nigga D-I-E
And where I'm from
Mother fucka' 5-0-tree
I don't fuck with niggas who bitter
And back pedal, the fact is...you lame
Homie got a vendetta but never get it together
Your best friend insane
I'm looking at life in a different light
I'm a beast in disguise
Waking up this morning, I got crust in my eyes
Funny how the money make a nigga go blind
Subliminal shots
That be for kids
Look at the clock
I'm sick of my wrist
Shoutout to Meech
That's my nigga and shit
I call up Yos oh, yeah
We lit in this bitch
Iller than ill, sicker than sick
Ride for my dogs like a nigga Mike Vick
Who you know can rap like this?
You fucks with me like your first name Vick
My bars on freeze, that mean I'm cold, nigga you know
These (nuts) don't play around
TMI, TMI, but you notice now
I'm a beast, I'm a beast
I got money on my mind
If a nigga gotta eat, I'm better
Bet a nigga dine
When I'm talking to my brio
He said all I got is time
I'm a beast motherfucker
You can hear it in my lines like
1. "New Romantics"
2. "22"
3. "Blank Space"
4. "Style"
5. "Fifteen"
6. "You Belong With Me"
7. "Holy Ground"
8. "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" / "Bad Blood
9. "Love Story"
10. "This Is What You Came For"
11. "Sparks Fly"
12. "Wildest Dreams/Enchanted"
13. "Out Of The Woods"
14. "Shake It Off"

[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
It's cold outside (Yeah)
Uh, uh, it's cold outside
Bad boy, bad boy
Uh, yeah
It's cold outside

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
What's going on?
What ya throwin on?
What's going on?
What ya throwin on?
What's going on?
What ya throwin on?
What's going on?

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Biggie Smalls, who you represent?
The Brooklyn clique
Where the boots is tied tight, and the jackets is thick
(Word up)
Represent them thugs
Not them shearling rugs
Leathers that fasten
Sean Combs be lasting
1x to 5x, so no need for lost weight
Affordable, way more cheaper than the North Face
Flavors in the bubble-goose, so let your trouble loose
So no-one be seeing them thugs that's demeaning
The flavors in the city, it's a pity
Them other damn jackets don't fit me
They just plain itty bitty
Why can't a big guy stay fly?
Listen up, Polo Grounds down to Bed-Stuy
Stay fly in that Brooklyn Mint
And here's the main reason
Sitting in that jacket, man I know you be freezing
Flavors in the vest
Bulletproof on the chest
Keep the burner on the waist
And still dress to impress

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
What's going on?
What ya throwin on?
What's going on?
What ya throwin on?
What's going on?
What ya throwin on?
What's going on?
What ya throwin on?

[Verse 2: Black Rob]
(Uh, baby baby!)
Y'all should know this rap thing, I got it down to a size
Big goose underneath it, that's the metal appliance
And if we don't bust a cap on you so called gangsters
Don't front, you a little bit scared now, ain't ya?
Now this is '05, it's a brand new thing
'Bout time the rap game crowned a brand new king
I been sitting here squadding on this Tidal belt
When I drive it, watch how my rivals felt
It's the second coming of Black, so run and get your raps
And do a couple of dips, and run a few laps
I stay in first place with the style of a Lear
If you try to battle the kid you really gon' need a
Whole crew, not 2 man, 3 or 4
You gon' lead the whole posse, a masimore
Even then B, ain't no chance for ya
You fucking round with the rap gargantuans
Bad Boy, man easy pimp
When I'm dishing out the pain nobody exempt
You was good 'til your scam uncovered
Who the man in fatigues with the blicky?
That's the god, belove it
And he cold like a bitch's heart
Yeah he cold and ridges hard
You don't want beef? Shit, don't start, man
It's B. Rob, I'm taking it back
D got Kim with the product, we cookin' crack

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
What's going on?
What ya throwin on?
What's going on?
What ya throwin on?
What's going on?
What ya throwin on?
What's going on?
What ya throwin on?
What's going on?
What ya throwin on?

[Verse 3: Black Rob]
Pop off 'till I'm hard and grey
I'mma even see Al Green get shot down like Marvin Gaye
No disrespect, pardon me
Lotta dudes got locked down but few had heart to stay
Puff couldn't take Marph's demay
Sit your five-dollar ass before I make change, stay in your lane
'Cause only champs sip on pain
You the type to like Piña Coladas, and getting caught in the rain

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Biggie Smalls, who you represent?
The Brooklyn clique
Where the boots is tied tight, and the jackets is thick

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane La Flare why you hard like that
Gator belt, gator shoes, where you shop at
Extra grams, like I'm cookin' up the dope with a extra hand
Yo gotti, money moe and Gucci Mane
Gonna mean two thangs
Worth two mill if the jewelry appraised
I'm with the money moe so you know its scrapin'
They call me baker man cause I cook the pies up
Skrt skrt skrt bout to scrape the sauce up
I already got the money, want the power
I got 10 G's, he make ten a hour
Double up, lil shawty, double up
When you shoppin' with us, you best bet to double up
Bought a half yesterday now you want the whole thang
I'ma flush my wrist out when I'm in the dope game

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Baking soda mix it with water
12 hit the door flush it down the toilet
All of us trapaholics
They knock us out,  back to ballin'
Baking soda baking soda mix it with water
All of us trapaholics
12 hit the door flush it down the toilet
All of us trapaholics

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
This yo boy yo gotti know what I'm talking bout
Whole thang in the drought know what I'm talkin bout
Whip it up stretch it out thats what I'm 'bout
And if you wait too late I might be sold out
Jump in the s550 straight roll out
And if the money ain't right I'ma hold out
Cause I be hustlin', straight drug smugglin'
Interstate hustle they know whats happening
And I ain't servin' after 10 cause I'm all in
Cop a bird for the twenty nigga all ten
Deuce fours on the chevy got it crawlin
Hit the mall do it big, straight ballin'
Got a job, fuck it nigga call in
Get some hard be you'll own boss then
Cause I be shining, white and yellow diamonds
More money more bitches more crime then

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Baking soda mix it with water
12 hit the door flush it down the toilet

Baking soda baking soda mix it with water

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G]
Here's the situation: Larce got shot, now he facin' heaven or hell
But he living to tell who fucking did it, I got my crimey down wit' it
Just a grimy as me, slimy as me, check it
I got a long list of names and addresses
Even know the store where his momma buy her dresses
She gon' be the first one to ride in a Hearse son
Worse come to worse I'll kill his sister, I'll know he'll miss her
They just a family, other half of me, them niggas scared of me
I hope they prepared to be shot at, hit up with baseball bats
Thrown in the back of the Ac' with a trunk full of rats
Drive to Brooklyn and back, take him to the pier (Where?)
Way up in the back where the bums sleep at
Look him in the eye, "You wanna die, don't ya?"
"If you could change everything you did, you would, won't ya?"
But you can't, 'cause my brother can't breathe
Watching him bleed in the hospital, I had to leave
All I wanna do is kill your crew
Your grand moms might get wet on the church-house steps
The beef is set, whatever, show you the meaning of pressure
Killing faggot niggas like ya'll for pleasure (uh)
You can't measure, the pain that's inside - homicide
You can run but you can't hide
When the Benz with the tint's in front of your residence
Everybody on the stoop getting bent
White Chalk

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Craig G]
This nigga Blake told me to be calm and breathe slowly
You know me, I flip, niggas was tryna hold me
Called the hospital lobby, the doctor said he'll probably
Die, G, arms taped up with IVs
Heard he got blast and the shit surprised me
Larceny on his back, that some shit I can't see
But I can see me putting putting you on T.V
Yyou and your crew, Channel 22 news
Walkin' with cement shoes, stepping on seashells
In the bottom of the ocean, who the fuck you gon' tell?
Who the fuck you gon' see that can outlast me?
Outlast me, stamina's nasty
Call erase on Trife, well Blake call me Snake
How you gonna act when you hear these .9s break?
Car doors closing, trench coats open
Tommy gun start smoking
Leave you on a cold street, chokin'
On your own blood, fuck the joking, I ain't kidding
MAC spitting, niggas gettin' hit, backflippin' wounded
Tryna plea, breaking off full speed
Jumping over gates, screaming, "Vec, it wasn't me"
I see the fear as I stare through these Cartier lenses
You 10 yards ahead jumping fences
Breathing mad hard, begging God for forgiveness
But he ain't hearing you, so I'ma end this, fatality, finished
Death is calling, Ruger hit you 5 times while you was falling
White chalk started drawing

[Intro]
Yeah, more, yeah

[Verse]
More time with family and friends, more life
More time to get it right
It's only me, but I'm seeing four shadows in the light
My demons visit me every night
To the most high, I'm forever indebted
I know I gotta pay somethin', I know that day's comin'
I put it all in the music
Because if I don't say it here, then I won't say nothin'
Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges
Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazin'
I need to start losing my shit on you niggas that's hatin'
Too reserved, like I called ahead for me and my lady
Free C5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting?
Ever since the blue basement, I found God and I lost patience
Between rocks and hard places of all places
Spotted everywhere, like Dalmatian
Cops snoop around now, 'cause all of my dogs famous
Please welcome the October fall baby
Vaughan Road Academy, star player—my mind's not all there
Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer
People too scared to tell the truth, so it's all dares
Count it, it's all there, and we all square
Quick money, I'm in and out
My dad used to use a soap bar 'til it's thinnin' out
But, shit, look at Dennis now, all Stacy Adams and linen'd out
More blessings for Sandi and him, more life
My parents never got it right
But God bless 'em both, I think we all alike
We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change
If we do get to do it twice in another life
Scared to go to sleep now
'Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like
Back when the bar that I had set for myself was out of sight
Tell me how I went and did chin-ups on this shit when I can't see it
Pin-ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier
Soul sisters inspired my old scriptures
Now that feeling's gone like them old pictures
Mixin' liquor got us both twisted, words get so vicious
You just stare at me while you roll Swishers
Girl, I love you, but I don't miss ya
And no matter what year it is, I'm a 06er
Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school, man
Fuck the rap game, it's all lies and it's all filthy
Two percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it
Got two of my niggas off with a "not guilty"
Gave back to the city and never said it if I didn't live it
But still, they try and tell you I'm not the realest
Like I'm some privileged kid that never sat through a prison visit
Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon
I never worked to get it
But really it's you with all the drug dealer stories
That's gotta stop, though
You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo
If you ask me though, you ain't lining the trunk with kilos
You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas
Like, "This what we need to be on," but you never went live
You middle-man in this shit, boy, you was never them guys
I can tell, 'cause I look most of you dead in your eyes
And you'll be tryna sell that story for the rest of your lives
Can't show us where the cash is, me, I don't judge
I'm just going off what the math is, numbers inflated
They all look at me, like, "What have you done for me lately?"
"I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest."
Aw, baby, stop debatin', I'm just a creative
My numbers out of this world
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated
You were the man on the moon
Now you just go through your phases
Life of the angry and famous
Rap like I know I'm the greatest then give you tropical flavors
Still never been on hiatus
You stay xann'd and perk'd up
So when reality set in, you don't gotta face it
I'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis
It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces
I'm like a real estate agent, putting you all in your places
Look what happens soon as you talk to me crazy
Is you crazy?

[Chorus]
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

[Verse 1]
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Look like you hidin' your problems
Really you never was solid
No, you can't "son" me
You won't never get to run me
Just when shit look out of reach
I reach back like one, three
Like one, three, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake
I don't trust a word you say
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
Look you in the face, and it's just not the same

[Chorus]
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

[Verse 2]
Yeah, straight up to my face, tryna play it safe
Vibe switch like night and day
I can see it, like, right away
I came up, you changed up
I caught that whole play
Since, things never been the same

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake (I can tell that love is fake)
I don't trust a word you say (I don't trust a word)
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
(That's just what I heard)
Look you in the face, and it's just not the same

[Chorus]
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

[Outro]
Skrrt
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?

[Intro: Drake & Skooly]
Yeah
We got London on da Track

[Verse 1: Drake]
This is all God's doin', man, you can't plan it
But if the devil's in the details, then I'm Satanic
'Bout to take over your city and you can't stand it
My accountant say you sinkin' like the Titanic
David Blaine last summer, man, you had to vanish
I get the hits like somebody pitchin' underhanded
Got my Spanish ting convinced that I know Spanish
Really, when she get to talkin', I don't understand it
You ain't own it right away, you had to wait on niggas
Man, I'm only twenty-nine, have some patience with us
Plus I never met nobody from my label, nigga
I just pop up with the music then they pay a nigga (Yeah)

[Refrain: Drake]
Shit ain't been the same like before
I still love it but I used to love it more
FaceTime with my shawty on tour
And she textin' purple hearts 'cause she know that we at war, yuh

[Chorus: Drake & 21 Savage]
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my bros for assistance
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Put me in a fucked-up position (Yah)
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance (21)
Make me call my bro (21, uh)

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Baby, I'm a savage, I ain't romantic
When I come around, these rapper niggas start to panic
And they pockets goin' under like the Titanic
Got some head last night and it was outstandin'
They was hatin' on me then and they hatin' now (Hatin' now)
She was playin' with me then but she waitin' now (21, 21)
Used to sleep inside a den, I got acres now (Mansion)
I was fightin' niggas then but I'm sprayin' now (Blastin')
I don't pay no mind to no sneak diss (Nope)
I won't spend a dime on a freak bitch (Broke)
Niggas takin' cheap shots on some cheap shit (21)
They the type to stand in line for some free shit (Broke bitch)
Baby girl gon' suck it till her jaws locked (Suck it up)
She gon' make me put my bitch on call block (Fuckin' up)
We the ones poppin', we the ones shoppin' (21)
We the one droppin' niggas, we the ones (We the ones)
They the ones duckin' when them heaters come (21, 21)
You that nigga snitchin' on your people, huh? (Shh)
21 Savage a.k.a. The Reaper, huh (21)
Pussy niggas gettin' shot for all that reachin', huh (Ya dig?)

[Chorus: Drake & 21 Savage]
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin' (Shut the fuck up)
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end (Count the fuck up)
Make me call my bros for assistance (21)
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance (Bros)
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin' (Hol' up)
Put me in a fucked-up position (21)
Make me call my bros for assistance
Make me call my bro, dawg

[Verse 3: Drake]
I don't need love, I'm the GOAT, I just hit the beat and float
And I'm sellin' out arenas but you puttin' on a show
I been tryna change life around for everyone I know
'Cause if I don't share the wealth
Then how the fuck we supposed to grow?
Mom's stressed, there's a lot of things we need
Chain smokin' in the house, it's hard to breathe
I used to have to hit my Ts with Febreze
Jordan pull up in the TL, now I'm cheese
I'ma turn this TSX into a Benz soon
I'ma see a lot of blessin's for my friends soon
Hunnid-fifty-inch screen in my bedroom
6'1", man, a nigga need some leg room

[Refrain: Drake]
Shit ain't been the same like before
They ain't even wanna look up at the score
FaceTime with my shawty on tour
And she textin' purple hearts 'cause she know that we at war, yuh

[Chorus: Drake]
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my bros for assistance
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Put me in a fucked-up position
Make me call my bros for assistance
Make me call my bro, don't

[Chris Wallace]
Look in the sky
Wonder why
Most MCs alibis
Won't comply
With my style of rhyme
Or rhyming or rap
It's not a trap
My rhyme just snap --

[??]
And we were laughing and laughing, like "You ain't never gonna be on Video Musicbox, man..'

[Chris Wallace]
Mozzle, mozzle
Run around, mozzle and pop
Yeah I put that on pops

[??]
We wanted to find a way to get on the map, fast..
So, that birthed The Techniques. Two DJs, and Chris was THE MC

[Chris Wallace]
This is the wail of a tale
Of a male who gotta pay my bills
And I'll nail 'em in to sail the seven seas--

[Verse 1]
Summertime in Virginia was a oven (oven)
All the kids eating ice cream with their cousins (cousins)
I was studyin' while you was playing the dozens (dozens)
Don't act like you was there when you wasn't

[Refrain 1]
Runnin' from the man (man) runnin' from the badge (badge)
Don't act like you was there when you wasn't
Runnin' toward our plans (plans) in the judge's hands (hands)
Don't act like you was there when you wasn't

[Pre-Chorus]
I know they say you crawl 'fore you walk
But in my mind I already jog
If I stand still I cannot get far
They want the Moon, I'm on Mars

[Chorus]
Sometime my mind dives deep
When I'm runnin'
I don't want no free ride
I'm just sick and tired of runnin'
Some nights I cry
Cause I can see the day comin'
Together we'll fight
Oh, but no more runnin'

[Verse 2]
You and I are not different from each other (other)
Shut our eyes, when we slumber I see numbers (numbers)
Black and white, we're computers, I ain't colored (colored)
Don't act like you was there when you wasn't

[Refrain 2]
From runnin' to exams (exams) to jobs for a man (man)
Don't act like you was there when you wasn't
In the law of the land (land) the women were often banned (banned)
Don't act like you was there when you wasn't

[Pre-Chorus]
I know they say you crawl 'fore you walk
But in my mind I already jog
If I stand still I cannot get far
They want the Moon, I'm on Mars

[Chorus]
Sometime my mind dives deep
When I'm runnin'
I don't want no free ride
I'm just sick and tired of runnin'
Some nights I cry
Cause I can see the day comin'
Together we fight
Oh, but no more runnin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I know they say you crawl 'fore you walk
But in my mind I already jog

Sometime my mind dives deep

I don't want no free ride
I'm just sick and tired of runnin'
Some nights I cry

Woah, woah

[Verse 1]
You gotta know I want you
I'm tryna be better than
Nigga making calls, this gun tucked in my Letterman
Jacket, I pack it up on this motherfucking avenue
You know what I had to do
Was selling a pack or two
The money was all there, wasn't a fortune
Tenants talking eviction, she stepping all on our doorstep
So I hit the corner, hustling out for Jordans
You up on my trap phone talking these abortions
Baby you know that all of this shit is for you
Baby I hit that corner up for us
Though I be bummy and scummy
Through wires and fire you know I be on it for us
Shawty when I'm in that there
I'ma win that there
I wear a king's struggle 'til I'm sitting in that chair, yeah
So just promise that you'll never forget me
And when you see me you better accept me
Remember the crew on the glow up
Everything on the show up
Selling 'til the door up tryna get all the dough up
I can take you Caribana, we can fuck a float up
Came a long way from tryna hustle a four up
Picture you sitting up in that kitchen
You cooking doing the dishes
I'm in the room weighing dope up
Shit's changed, I done came from the pain
So when you see me, promise that you'll do the same shawty

[Chorus]
And when the things change you'll still be the same
And when things change you'll still call my name
As a nigga shawty I'm just tryin, tryna change
You know things change, things change yeah

[Verse 2]
And I'm just tryna be better
With this nine in my sweater
I hit the avenue and grind for the cheddar
For that bread, for that beef, that lettuce, I'm working
Even when it ain't worth it I bring you that burger
Gotta know that we be flipping dope
The coppers is on corners watching so we getting ghost
But it's you on top of my mind when I'm in the corner hustling
With all of my niggas you gotta know I got to hit the folks
But look you knew the vision, I got a hustle the dream
My niggas hustle and scheme
Just tryna hustle something
And that's as it seems all of us from the bottom
So when we got it, got it, know it's us over everything nigga
Old time nigga, old time nigga
Shawty fuck me like I'm your long time nigga
Make 'em all forget you, they got Alzheimer's nigga
And they say they want you, it's a long line nigga
If they don't see you then they all blind niggas
I mean it's either that or I'm a sharp eyed nigga
Cause I see you and I think baby we a duo
Selling shatter get our pockets fatter than a sumo
NWO, that's the way we team up
You deserve an award then get your body link up
You ain't scared to check me on corners where I be on it
And you know it's where the bodmon ah I link up
Man have di tings up but it ain't about that
It's about you and nothing else cause I'm 'bout that
You ain't just pop out the sky I had to scout that
Just a few reasons why you should never doubt that

[Outro]
Fargo, and it's no one better
Used to show up at your house in that shogun leather
Used to push a Honda Accord in the '01 weather
Now me and you in that Wraith feel so much better, don't it?
We came up together
It's only right we Rolls Royce the lane up together
It's only right we VVS the chain cuts together
And promise me you gon' give me that same love forever
I swear I ain't tryna play musical chairs
I ain't here judging, I'm tryna come through in the clear
Fuck you, put two in the air
Fingers all through in your hair, tell me you love it
End of the day I'm just a TO nigga
I'm just tryna do better for ya
Tryna be the best so there ain't nothing better for ya
Know how I feel, Fargo
Verse 1
Baby girl on fire
You know what she wants to do
Baby girl on fire
Sick of me waiting on you

If you could get away you'd use those hands, wouldn't you..
Well i figured out whats behind that glance, wouldn't you...

Chorus

Baby girl on fire
You know the way she wanna feel

On your breath you moan and pant

[Verse]
Can't believe I fell in love with her
Now I don't even wanna fuck with her
Feel like nothing's ever enough with her
Barely checkin' to see what's up with her
'Cause I had some player traits that I let you take away
You said you'll stay the same and look how you changed your ways
And I feel like it's half way my fault 'cause I just
I fell in love with her, knowin' exactly what it was with her
Knowin' nothin' could ever ever be enough with her
I split up with her
And when I feel like I need it and she come up again
Back it up, again
Then we fight and we fuss and then we love, we lust
And then we kiss, we touch and then we fuck again
We used to fuck all day
We'd rotate them blunts all day
You were down to hit that lick
We would split that shit both ways, oh
But you don't know
If it ain't love what we come for?
Let them hoes be in the front rows
While you and me count these hundos

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Hold me up high for a while
You always said I'd learn to cry, and you were right
And I wept through your hold of the night

When you gave me something
Then it feels like summer
I keep on runnin' back

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Sit back and open wide
Let me see you're dead inside
It's so hard to swim against the tide

I'm back trippin' over cracks in the road
Won't you slow me down?

[Chorus]
Spirit grows when love goes away
And I'm still thinking of a new way to say
"I miss you"

[Verse 2]
It wasn't so hard to get
You're a figure in the dark, a silhouette
And you crept through the hole in my head

You were the feat of the sun, and it seems so funny
You keep on comin' back

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Hold tight and clench your fists
'Cause your eyes aren't filled with phantom kiss
And just pray to your god that you missed

Rise up, floating over loves
That you've left

[Chorus]
Spirit grows when love goes away
And I'm still thinking of a new way to say
That I'm missing you

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
I know it's late to be callin', whatcha doin' right now?
I couldn't wait, til tomorrow, to get to takin' you out
I gotta see you girl ASAP, I gotta get you right here next to me
Getcha right here next to me

[Chorus]
On a last minute, late night, date night
Me holdin' you tight, til the break of dawn
Little midnight, kissin' and red wine sippin'
And listenin' to the crickets singin' love songs
Little moonlight shinning in your eyes
Hitting 'em just right, girl we can't go wrong
On a last minute, late night, date night
Me holdin' you tight, til the break of dawn. Come on
Come on
Come on
Oh girl come on
Come on
Come on

[Verse 2]
I'm on my way, in a hurry, I'll be there in five
It's okay, don't you worry, I know your lookin' so fine
In that bulldog t-shirt, hair pulled back
You know I love it when you lookin' like that
You know I love it when you lookin' like that

[Chorus]
On a last minute, late night, date night
Me holdin' you tight, til the break of dawn
Little midnight, kissin' and red wine sippin
And listenin' to the crickets singin' love songs
Little moonlight shinning in your eyes
Hitting 'em just right, girl we can't go wrong
On a last minute, late night, date night
Me holdin' you tight, til the break of dawn
Come on
Come on
Come on
Oh girl come on
Come on
Come on

[Bridge]
Girl, I, know, this, might sound crazy, but, I, can't, help, it
When I'm crazy for you baby, ain't playin' when I'm sayin'

[Chorus]
We're having a last minute, late night, date night
Me holdin' you tight, til the break of dawn
Little midnight, kissin' and red wine sippin'
And listenin' to the crickets singin' love songs
Little moonlight shinning in your eyes, hitting 'em just right, girl we can't go wrong
On a last minute, late night, date night
Me holdin' you tight, til the break of dawn
Come on
Come on
Come on
Oh girl come on
Come on, come on
Oh girl come on, come on, come on
On a last minute, late night, date night
Me holdin you tight, til the break of dawn

[Verse 1]
Always stayin' out late, get off at 8
But you come to door at 3
Name on your phone says caller unknown
But girl you ain't foolin' me
I can see it in your eyes and all the shh you hide

[Chorus]
All your excuses, they're always in the way
Do you think that I'm stupid, make a new one everyday
But you can't lie, girl I ain't blind
If love is just a game you play, well then you're losin'
Stupid excuses

[Verse 2]
Say you're out with your friends, try to pretend
Like I don't know what you're doing
It's funny to me, the joke is on you
And girl I see through it

[Chorus]
All your excuses, they're always in the way
Do you think that I'm stupid, make a new one everyday
But you can't lie, girl I ain't blind
If love is just a game you play, well then you're losin'
Stupid excuses
All your excuses, they're always in the way
Do you think that I'm stupid
Girl you ain't foolin' me

All your excuses, they're always in the way
Do you think that I'm stupid, make a new one everyday
But you can't lie, girl I ain't blind
If love is just a game you play, well then you're losin'
Stupid excuses

The last anyone heard of Mudoc Niccals, he was living on Plastic Beach, an island in the South Pacific formed entirely from rubbish.

All was well, until the day Murdoc's tropical ghetto was raided by pirates. (Not the eye-patch king - those modern-day ones with machine guns and no sense of flair). Murdoc decided that evacuation was the bravest option, and fled heroically in a rusty brown submarine.

With only a crate of Psycho Jerry's Rum for sustenance and Cyborg Noodle for company, Murdoc navigated his way through the slimy Octopuses Garden. Cyborg Noodle proved the perfect shipmate for Murdoc: she didn't speak, she didn't judge, and she had absolutely no sense of smell.

Finally, when the booze ran out, Murdoc made to the surface and popped the hatch, releasing the rum-soaked air of the submersible like a kraken's guff. As he emptied his dangerously enlarged bladder, a giant shadow loomed over him. Two, if you count the ever-present memory of his disappointed father. But the other shadow was a ship: the Battleship Ringo, owned by music industry giant EMI.

Before it was chopped up and sold like a prize pig, EMI had sent a fleet of ships to search the globe for Murdoc. At last, they had him. The Gorillaz star was captured, slapped about a bit, and taken to a secret prison on London.

'Dungeon Abbey', beneath Abbey Road Studios, was built to detain the label's ABCs (Artists in Breach of Contract). For three years it served as Murdoc's home, until one day, he was offered a deal by Entertainment Internal Affairs. Like an unloved goldfish, the music industry was in dire need of Murdoc's legendary song-writing prowess. In exchange for his release (and a carton of Lucky Lungs cigarettes), Murdoc agreed to write a new Gorillaz album and moved immediately to a new studio home in West London.

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
I think I see confetti from this potion
Pillow fights and feathers, overdosin'
Smells like a cologne and candy lotion
Like a slumber party
Sheets all on the floor just like an ocean
Building up your fortress like a mountain
Neighbors say we're causin' a commotion
Like a slumber party

[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears]

She don't believe that I could love her
Could I love her?
Only one way to know
Somewhere she won't go

[Chorus]
Well, I think that I could love her

[Verse 2: Kanye]
They like Pablo why are all the windows tinted on your Tahoe?
Why do you know every single bitch that I know?
Why can't you just shut your mouth and take the high road?
Fuck if I know, that's that Chicago, (aye)
South, south, side, that's the motto, (aye)
Cop a crib and spend ten million on remodel
Take the devils out my life and preach the gospel, cause I know
We went way, way past the line of scrimmage, aye
Throne is back up in it, aye
In the field like Emmitt, aye, y'all get so offended, aye
I be blacking out, I ain't backing out
Jay about his business, and I'mma let you finish but I
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna rock your body
Take you to the garage and do some karate
Chop it, chop it, chop it, chop it sipping sake
Throw a thick bitch on a Kawasaki

[Verse 1]
Steady as a rock, I stand, I wait
With eyes that see, but eyes that can't erase
Hands that hold, but hands that can't embrace
A creature longing for some saving grace

Oh, and I have long since seen the Sun
It set along the banks when I was young
Oh, and it's been long since you've been near
But fate was never kind to us, my dear

Oh-woah, oh-woah
Oh-woah, oh-woah
Oh-woah, oh-woah
Oh-woah, oh-woah

We live, we grow, we die, it snows

We need, we need, we need, I need

Oh-woah, oh-woah
Oh-woah, oh-woah
Oh-woah, oh-woah

Wanna be down, so I walk into the store
Right?
And it is crazy 'cause we do what we do
And every time it feels like deja vu

Our heartbeats went on and on
And on and on and on and on and on
Right?

Feels like maybe I seen you before
Feels like I known you from somewhere

Maybe in our past lives
I'm not falling for disguise
You know I can't forget those eyes

And on and on and on and on and on
Right?
Feels like I known you from somewhere
(I watch as I met you for the first time)
Feels like maybe I seen you before
Feels like I known you from somewhere
(I watch as I met you for the first time)
Feels like I seen you before

I know the switch when you walk
The accent when you talk

[0] of your thought
Right?
Stored in my mind's camera
A figure from Atlanta
And the swagger from New York
Right?
I'm just hoping we can kick it like old times
Ya dig it, baby? Where ya wanna go?
Right?

[Hook]
Our heartbeats went on and on
And on and on and on and on and on

[Verse 1]
I've been waiting to open up my eyes
See the gift that Santa got for me
And lately he's been jaded
But this year I've got a fire
To lighten up my Christmas tree
And I couldn't ask for more
The mood is right and all
Pour me some more egg nog
Huh, feels like it's Christmas time, uh

[Hook]
Mistletoe's over you
Tell me what you're supposed to do
Mistletoe's over you
Tell me what you're supposed to do

You're exactly who I wanted to see (Exactly who I wanted to see)
Girl you look amazing (You're amazing, baby)

What Santa slipped down this chimney
And baby and it's so, so gone
You ask which drug I'm on
And I say it's just egg nog
Baby it's Christmas time

[Hook]
Mistletoe's over you, ah

And rollin' with my bitch, that's where you might find me

[Verse 1]
Fight or flight, I choose to run
Composure instantly undone
I catch my breath, but it's too small
I breathe again, I breathe in all

[Verse 2]
And everything we ever shared
I stand with all my secrets bared
But walk alone into the night
For you were all, the greatest light

[Chorus]
Though the fire has died
And the ash, it subsides
The embers stay burning for you

[Verse 3]
Clocks, they always seem to lie
On minute hands, you can't rely
But heartbeats always tell the truth
They race at just the thought of you

[Verse 4]
The same way that they always have
Shy of hopeful, never sad
But always wondering, always afraid
That you forgot just what we made

[Chorus]
Though the fire has died
And the ash, it subsides
The embers stay burning for you

[Bridge]
And if they die, I'll still remember
If they die, I'll still remember (I'll remember)
If they die, I'll still remember you (I'll remember)
And if they die, I'll still remember (I'll remember)
If they die, I'll still remember (I'll remember)
If they die, I'll still remember you (I'll remember)
And if they die, I'll still remember (I'll remember)
If they die, I'll still remember (I'll remember)
If they die, I'll still remember you (I'll remember)

[Chorus]
Though the fire has died
And the ash, it subsides
The embers stay burning for you
You said get money that shit don't excite me
Guissepes when I'm trapping these ain't no Nike
Call up my jeweller he keep me so icey
Hit a hunnid bands jugg in 2003
Hop out the rari looking like the president
Pussy ass nigga I run in your residence
I trap out the bando me and my little nigga we having it
Pull on yo block your chain we snatching it
Trapping ass nigga you know that im trapping it
I'm trapping in zone 1 bitch I'm riding with savages
Hit a yellow bone bitch from the back
Mini Mac 11 make you do backflips
Hit the highway now its time to go take a trip
150 bricks when I water whip
Fuck nigga try to rob king soulja
The Mac 11 nigga make a nigga do backflips
Try us I swear to God!!!
I pull out that draco my young nigga with me ain't having it
Here for a M but my clique on some savage shit
Came up now I ride with the baddest bitch
Grab the draco I'm spraying the heat
Chopper knock a nigga straight off his feet
You ain't no trapping nigga never ever seen a key
Wrap up the bricks shipping down to Tennesee
Mini Mac 10 and draco that's my heat
250 bands money counter beat
Suwoo the rollie nigga banging big b's
Whipping up dope Givenchi on my feet
Fuck nigga I get money I can't even see
Pull on yo block .223's red beams
Pull on yo block serving molly and lean
Fuck with lil dre you get hit with them red beams
Alla my niggas turn it to a murder scene
Run in ya house with a mask like its halloween
Came up from the bottom serving them keys
Double cup styrofoam sipping lean
Which one these niggas want beef with me
Run in yo house (bloah!) fuck nigga take everything
100 thousand made it in a week
Sipping on lean I'm bout to go fall asleep
Trap out the bando I feel like president
Draco on me it can knock down an elephant
I'm trapping and capping they say that its evident
I'm in the streets shopping they say Soulja should run for president
I'm stacks on deck money gang nigga be having it
Pull on yo block and I empty the whole clip
You kissing that bitch and she sucking my whole clique
Fuck with lil soulja you gone get your throat slit
Call up my shooters they come get your door kick
Niggas snitching but these niggas don't know shit
Fuck bout 20 hoes I go through the most shit
Serve bout 20 pounds no I don't smoke em
Forgiatos, Bentley truck what I'm rolling
Ride through Chiraq and they say that I'm holding
Came from a 12 I don't fuck with patrol man
Serving that cocaine feeling like snowman
Junkie hit my front door on the dope man
Say they hear shots (?)
Tried to shoot at the fuck nigga damn but the door jam
Hop in the rari you know that I chased them
Had the pistol on me but that shit jammed
Smoking on dope I feel like the shit man
Sipping on lean I feel like a kickstand
Shoot with draco I feel like the hitman

[Verse 1]
Excuse me for a minute
'Cause this won't be brief
I've been hiding these words
Under my tongue, protected
By the walls of my yellow-stained teeth

[Verse 2]
They've festered and broken
And they've rearranged
They've misspelled themselves
And now they're leaking out of my brain

[Verse 3]
They say ashes to ashes
And dust to dust
But my heart's made of metal
And the clasp's rusted shut
'Cause you left it out in the rain

[Chorus 1]
And if these are the last breaths
I'm breathing on Earth
Then I pray to God
You remember me when
My body is deep in the Earth

[Verse 4]
My back's ached for years
Carrying my heavy heart
It beats itself silly
And pounds through the dark
Sustaining a life that lives within

[Verse 5]
And yet was so desperate
To beat in time
It rang in your rhythm
And mimicked your rhyme

[Verse 6]
You can't blame it for trying
Or clinging to love
But love's left my soul
And I've forgotten love
And what's left is your smoky silhouette

[Chorus 2]
But if these are the last breaths
I'm breathing on Earth
Then I pray to God
You remember me
When my body is deep in the Earth

[Chorus 3]
These are the last breaths
I'm breathing on Earth
Then I pray to God
You remember me
When my body is deep in the Earth

[Verse 1]
In the morning, I'll be rising, I'll be waking with the sun
Gearing for the road, to pack my bags and then to run
And I'm not speaking 'cause the perfect words, I always lacked
In the morning, I'll be rising, running, and never coming back

[Chorus]
And I'm not waiting for the wolves to drag my body
I'm not waiting for the wolves
And I'm not waiting for the wolves to rip my heart out
I'm not waiting for the wolves

[Verse 2]
In the evening, I'll be resting, warmed by the Autumn harvest moon
And I'll be curing my disease, 'cause to you, I'm now immune
Searching for a reason 'cause one never did appear
In the evening, I'll be resting, dreaming of another year

[Chorus]
And I'm not waiting for the wolves to drag my body
I'm not waiting for the wolves
And I'm not waiting for the wolves to rip my heart out
I'm not waiting for the wolves

[Chorus]
Oh, and I'm not waiting for the wolves to drag my body
I'm not waiting for the wolves
I'm not waiting for the wolves to rip my heart out
I'm not waiting for the wolves

[Verse 1]
Well, I've lived a short life
Not a lot of things that I've seen
But in that short life
Lot of things that I've been

[Verse 2]
I've been a daughter
And a sister too
I've been in trouble
And I've been in love with you

[Chorus 1]
We are all just creatures, baby
Fumbling towards the light
And I'm crawling on my knees now, baby
Won't you make my heart alright?
Won't you make my heart alright?

[Verse 3]
Well there is an old house
That I think about sometimes
With all its creaky floorboards
And height marks of an outgrown child

[Verse 4]
But it burnt down sometime ago
Or so it would seem
And I still see its dying colors
In the Autumn leaves

[Chorus 2]
And we are all just creatures, baby
Longing to be free
And if we're all just creatures, baby
Won't you give your heart to me?
Won't you give your heart to me?

[Verse 5]
Well, I swim in the river
Only once or twice each year
But I found that the river
It was often insincere

[Verse 6]
So now I dip my toes in
Still expecting to get wet
But without my whole body
My fate, it has been set

[Chorus 3]
And we are all just creatures, baby
Blinded by our fears
If you're scared of love, now, baby
You'll know only loneliness and fear
Only loneliness and fear

[Outro]
And I may only be a creature
But I'm still fumbling towards the light

[Verse 1]
The forest is dark and I'm wide awake, not sleeping
The road to my heart is stark but I'm alive
Which way would you run if you were looking through my glass eyes?
Or would your clean skin leave you paralyzed?

[Verse 2]
And baby I was born to daylight
With twilight tangled in the sky
And as I escape and take flight
I am running free of all those tangled wires

[Chorus 1]
And I'll be home by morning
And the morning light will warm my tired bones
I'll run through the trees and through the forest
And in morning, by morning I'll be home

[Bridge]
By morning, by morning, by morning, by morning
By morning, by morning, by morning, by morning
By morning, by morning, by morning, by morning
By morning, by morning, by morning, by morning

[Chorus 2]
And I'll be home by morning
And the morning light will warm my tired bones
(By morning, by morning, by morning, by morning)
I'll run through the trees and through the forest
(By morning, by morning, by morning, by morning)
And in morning, by morning I'll be home
(By morning, by morning, by morning, by morning)

[Outro]
By morning, by morning, by morning, by morning
(By morning I'll be home)
By morning, by morning, by morning, by morning
(By morning I'll be home)
By morning, by morning, by morning, by morning
By morning
(By morning I'll be home)

[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Dear old tree in my front yard
Thank you for the shade
Your leaves are speckled with streaming rays of sun
And I love the rustling sound they make

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The swing on your branch is my favorite spot
And I'm sorry for the steps we nailed into your bark

[Chorus]
Yes, I'll love you forever
Yes, I'll love you still
And I'll love you more than any man
Oh, I always will

[Verse 2]
Dear old chickens that wander through my yard
Thank you for the eggs that you've laid
Oh, their blue/green shells are speckled with dirt
And I love the rustling sound they make

[Pre-Chorus 2]
While chasing you is something I admit I've done a lot
I would never steam or fry you or put you in a pot

[Chorus]
Yes, I'll love you forever
Yes, I'll love you still
And I'll love you more than any man
Oh, I always will

[Verse 3]
Dear old house that I grew up in
I miss you when I'm gone
The dog hair on my sofa
And the light through my window at dawn

[Pre-Chorus 3]
While I know at times it seems like I am far away
I'll be home on thanksgiving and on Christmas day

[Chorus]
Yes, I'll love you forever
Yes, I'll love you still
And I'll love you more than any man
Oh, I always will

[Chorus]
Yes, I'll love you forever
Yes, I'll love you still
And I'll love you more than any man
Oh, I always will

[Verse 1]
And I'll turn eighteen on a Sunday
And it'll be the day I've waited for
Mom will bake cake and there'll be presents
Like there always was before
But if time keeps moving just like this
Then it won't be soon before I'm old

[Chorus]
And they will all be wishing they could just be kids like us
And they will all be wishing they could just be kids like us
But I'm getting older with each day
And soon, I'll be wishing, too

[Verse 2]
And on the eve of my fifth birthday
When my father found me in tears
And I've always been fearless
But scared of oncoming years
And he tried to make it alright
And he told me not to cry

[Chorus]
And they will all be wishing they could just be kids like us
And they will all be wishing they could just be kids like us
But I'm getting older with each day
And soon, I'll be wishing, too

[Verse 3]
It's easy to remember
When everything was calm
Two hands on the bike I rode
Just me and my mom
But I haven't rode in a long while
Because I drive most of the time

[Chorus]
And they will all be wishing they could just be kids like us
And they will all be wishing they could just be kids like us
But I'm getting older with each day
And soon, I'll be wishing, too
And soon, I'll be wishing, too

Dodge a lot of cases, stickin' to the basics
Rock a lot of chains, do a lot of things
Bottles by the cases, stickin' to the basics
Do it on the regular, fuckin' on the regular
Drippin' on the regular, trippin' on the regular
Count it on the regular, sippin' on the regular
Never smokin' regular, nigga, we ain't regular

[Verse 2]
Woah, woah, woah
Regular, regular, regular
I do not see no competitors
Hatin' cause we got ahead of them
I'm getting money, etcetera
Bad bitches all on my schedule
Felony, felony, felony
I catch a case and it's federal
Bikes out, summer time, aye
Mikes on number nine, yeah
Bad bitch, hella fine, woah
She don't fuck, never mind, no
I'ma get at her another time
I'ma go scoop me a yellow dime
She go both ways like the yellow line
I'm fuckin' her friends, she fuckin' mine, oh shit
Still trippin', ain't no love for the other side
Rap beef turn to homicides
When we land on them and them hollows fly
Had a bag but you broke, nigga
You ain't fuckin' with me, bottom line
Out of sight, nigga, out of mind
And my Patek runnin' out of time

[Chorus]
Sell a lot of dope
Dodge a lot of cases, stickin' to the basics
Rock a lot of chains, do a lot of things
Bottles by the cases, stickin' to the basics
Do it on the regular, fuckin' on the regular
Drippin' on the regular, trippin' on the regular
Count it on the regular, sippin' on the regular
Never smokin' regular, nigga, we ain't regular

[Chorus]
Wasn't for this music, I'd prolly be dead
Instead I'm on top and I'm countin' this bread
Sittin' in the mansion, could've been in the feds
Drop top even with a price on my head, woah
It's no roof so they can see me shine
No roof so they can see me shine
Only a matter of time, it's dedicated, put it all to the grind
It's no roof so they can see me shine, woah
It's no roof so they can see me shine
No roof so they can see me shine, only a matter of time
It's dedicated, put it all to the grind
It's no roof so they can see me shine, woah

[Verse 1]
I was born poor, but I'ma die rich
Ridin’ in the 7 like I’m Pac in '96
Still rockin’ with the clique I had to grind with
Went to war, flip nickels and sold them dimes with
Yea, I used to sell nicks of reggie, nigga
I get the chills every time that Liv confetti hit us
North Philly skinny bull but I'm heavy, nigga
They switched sides they was never with us
And petty niggas wanna mention my name to get acknowledged
Hoppin' that we act like a fool and give them violence
I'd rather kill 'em all with success and give 'em knowledge
Then throw it all away for a sucker 'cause we the hottest
My momma crib big as a church, I'm bein' modest
No sleep, puttin' in work, that's how she got it
'Bout it, 'bout it, I started grindin' when niggas doubted
Now I got it, I'm drippin' in diamonds, a nigga shinin'
That's gangsta

[Chorus]
Wasn't for this music, I'd prolly be dead
Instead I'm on top and I'm countin' this bread
Sittin' in the mansion, could've been in the feds
Drop top even with a price on my head, woah
It's no roof so they can see me shine
No roof so they can see me shine
Only a matter of time, it's dedicated, put it all to the grind
It's no roof so they can see me shine, woah
It's no roof so they can see me shine
No roof so they can see me shine
Only a matter of time, it's dedicated, put it all to the grind
It's no roof so they can see me shine, woah

[Verse 2]
Out in Hollywood trying not to get caught up in it
Struggle was brought up in it, hustle, we gonna get it
This one is for my youngins going to school with corner niggas
Don't get caught up in that boxing corner, nigga
Times changed, it's feeling like live niggas verse corny niggas
They building more jails, I'm warning niggas, shots fire
Momma crying, traumatizing they mourning, niggas
Them cops killing us like it's war with niggas, it's on with niggas
I did shed so many tears at that corner store
Man I spent so many years at that corner store
I see my niggas disappear at that corner store
When they was sleepin' we was there at that corner store
Yeah, and we was eating at the corner store
Coppers catch us and they beat us at that corner store
Shit, we was toting on them heaters at that corner store
'Cause they was plotting, tryna leave us at that corner store

[Chorus]
Wasn't for this music, I'd prolly be dead
Instead I'm on top and I'm countin' this bread
Sittin' in the mansion, could've been in the feds
Drop top even with a price on my head, woah
It's no roof so they can see me shine
No roof so they can see me shine
Only a matter of time, it's dedicated, put it all to the grind
It's no roof so they can see me shine, woah
It's no roof so they can see me shine
No roof so they can see me shine
Only a matter of time, it's dedicated, put it all to the grind
It's no roof so they can see me shine, woah

[Verse 3]
It's no roof so they can see me shine
Whole city came out just to see me rhyme
Started off in Impalas, now it's DB9
In the Aston like he James Bond, who he think he is?
Diamonds dancing all on me, doing the stanky leg
I hear them whispers, niggas talkin' what they think he made
Think what you want, you gon' think I'm paid
Should he be ballin'? I don't think he's safe
All I did was think and pray, I got young niggas in the grave
They got murdered by a nigga with some bitter ways
They don't give a fuck about us, put us in a cage
Let us out with that parole, man, this shit a maze
RIP to Snupe, RIP to Scooter
RIP to Dex, told him not to be a shooter
I tell Snupe, "They don't love ya, they just want to do ya"
You see that truck? That's the feds watchin', not an Uber

[Chorus]
Wasn't for this music, I'd prolly be dead
Instead I'm on top and I'm countin' this bread
Sittin' in the mansion, could've been in the feds
Drop top even with a price on my head, woah
It's no roof so they can see me shine
No roof so they can see me shine
Only a matter of time, it's dedicated, put it all to the grind
It's no roof so they can see me shine, woah
It's no roof so they can see me shine
No roof so they can see me shine
Only a matter of time, it's dedicated, put it all to the grind
It's no roof so they can see me shine, woah

I'mma pull up on you fourth quarter when it's crunch time

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
When I pull up to the crib (Pull up, pull up)
Hurry up and get dressed (What's up? What's up?)
Spend a couple hours on your makeup
Twenty minutes, I done made that to a mess
And you know like I know
I was your side nigga, you was my side hoe
He broke you in, I'm the one broke you out, though
'Cause you got that D and you turned to El Chapo
Run from that nigga if he tries to buy you Aldo
This that Givenchy, that new Saint Laurent flow
This that go cash out that G65 flow
I like you, you hit the lotto
I put you on to the Perc and Moscato
I put you on to fuckin' in Cabo
Said we would only fuck once and would stop, though
You know that's a lie, though

[Hook: Meek Mill]

Fuck her and her friend on the PJ
You know, I flew that girl to Turks on her b-day
I got up under her skirt on her b-day
Know I keep it in the stash house on keepsake
Know I walked in, a hundred thou' on the pre-k
Yeah, a hundred thou', back to back for a week straight
Girl, you know how we play

[Hook: Meek Mill]
And you know, you know
He don't be fuckin' you like I be fuckin' you

They said, "She fuckin' with him"
I'm like, "She fuckin' with who?"
'Cause now she fuckin' with me, ha

[Hook: Meek Mill]

[Intro]
Um

[Verse 1: Dyme-A-Duzin]
Recently I got clarity from a critic
That told me last year I was the business
And now I'm kinda slippin'
Like, "Who's Phony Ppl?"
He's wilin', dropped an R&B album and downloaded a thousand
'Cause who really wanna hear it?

[?] Kanye and he's swaying away from lyrics
Huh, I mean seriously
Your brand new songs, I don't feel it
That freshman junk can't touch, shut up and listen:
"A good attempt, but you could never make a masterpiece"
Well, that's what I was trying to do, actually
And then they laugh at me
'Cause I don't got a hit song, let alone a huge buzz so I have to beef
Now the labels is hittin' me with the pressure
And saying that I lost, I thought I was gettin' better
And now I'm attachin' this to a letter
So let it go out and doubt about whether or not
Whether it's good
If it's good

[Chorus: Dyme-A-Duzin]
Is it good?
Is it good?
Is it good? (Is it good?)
Is it good? (Is it good?)
Is it good? (Is it good?)
Is it good? (Is it good?)
My ears are open for some feedback
And I kinda even doubt I really need that
Tell me it's good
Is it good? (Is it good?)
Is it good? (Is it good?)
Is it good? (Is it good?)
Is it good?

[Verse 2: Elbee Thrie]
You see I got a phone call from my old friend
He said "What you been up to, you still producing?
Because I know some artists, why don't you produce them?"
He said "My speakers started smoking 'cause my beats was too hot"
And I quote: "But that was when I was a star, now I'm a telescope."
If riches was hot music, I would say I'm broke
But if it's fame, call me insane, but I say no one knows
Party down the block, Elbee Thrie, no one shows
I'm an open-minded composer
But listeners are close
So every time a beat I post 

[?]
Asking why I don't contact my high-hats till sixteenth-notes
Even with all my music in I still do it
Music's a universal language, I see you're not fluent
'Cause you don't understand I'm, you don't understand
I'm different
So say yes to these questions that I'm wishin'
Is it? 'Cause I just, I gotta know
Is it good?

[Chorus: Elbee Thrie]
Is it good?
Is it good?
Is it good?
Is it good?
Is it good?
Is it good?
Is it good?
My ears are open for some feedback
And I kinda even doubt I really need that
Tell me it's good
Is it good?
Is it good?
Is it good?

[Verse 3:]
I said it's really no different from a performance
Ripping, I'm still on it, I spit sick, the crowd more nuts than pack doormans
George Foreman: I grill 'em and kill 'em through brainstormin'
They're respondin' to my first EP, and that shit was borin'
Shot, 'cause I thought I was LeBron, and I was scorin'
But it's 2-3 minute songs of ballin' (Mike Jordan)
Sheesh, I find it hard to compete
You from the street
But you said this sound like Talib Kweli
But yo
How a door spitting this song called metaphors
Never listen to the critics, they're job is givin' jaw
The crowd will still applaud but them labels won't open doors
And I don't give up, I'm going harder than before
From the block, spittin' lyrics
Performin', plenty women
Makin' more than triple-digits
Like, come on (I'm just chillin')
Livin' strong, no more slack
It's all about the rap
This is the last track, it's whack
Gotta ask you cats now, is it good?

[Chorus: T-Pain]
They gon' talk about me, they gon' talk about me
They can't walk around me, they can't walk around me
Bitch I'm rich as fuck, bitch I'm rich as fuck
Them hoes can sick a duck, you can sick a duck
I get 10 Brazilians like I'm Dan Bilzerian
I get 10 Brazilians like I'm Dan Bilzerian
Bitch I'm rich as fuck, bitch I'm rich as fuck
Them hoes can sick a duck, bitches sick a duck

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I can pull up on you with a million bucks
Bitch I'm with the squad, we got a million trucks
Just 'cause you don't see me don't mean I ain't movin'
I be in the dark with the semi tucked
You don't want this shit to go to fisticuffs
Boy pass me that bottle, I ain't get enough
If they gon' talk about me I'ma let 'em talk
Bitch I'm takin' off, bitch I'm takin' off
Get off me, ho

[Chorus: T-Pain]
They gon' talk about me, they gon' talk about me
They can't walk around me, they can't walk around me
Bitch I'm rich as fuck, bitch I'm rich as fuck

Them hoes can sick a duck, bitches sick a duck

[Refrain: T-Pain]
I'ma get some sauce, I'ma get some sauce
I'ma get some sauce, I'ma get some sauce
Once they pour it on me you can't get it off
I'ma get some sauce, I'ma get some sauce
Get off me, ho

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Who that?
Throw that ho like two stacks
Hit it in the booty 'til them booty cheeks turn blue black
Order at the crib, bring the crew back
Let me see you do that, do that, huh, huh, woo!
Shout out to my niggas on that Houston shit
It ain't nothin' better than a Houston bitch
If she ain't let me fuck, I say, "Fuck that bitch"
But if she wanna fuck I'ma fuck that bitch
You see me bro?

[Chorus: T-Pain]
They gon' talk about me, they gon' talk about me
They can't walk around me, they can't walk around me
Bitch I'm rich as fuck, bitch I'm rich as fuck
Them hoes can sick a duck, you can sick a duck
I get 10 Brazilians like I'm Dan Bilzerian
I get 10 Brazilians like I'm Dan Bilzerian
Bitch I'm rich as fuck, bitch I'm rich as fuck
Them hoes can sick a duck, bitches sick a duck

[Refrain: T-Pain & Lil Yachty]
I'ma get some sauce, I'ma get some sauce
I'ma get some sauce, I'ma get some sauce
Once they pour it on me you can't get it off
Ayy, Lil Boat
I'ma get some sauce, I'ma get some sauce
Ayy, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat
Get off me, ho

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
All my niggas ridin' dirty on that old Chamillion' (skrrt skrrt)
I'ma be the first teenager to reach a trillion
Ooh bitch I'm rich as fuck, I don't need your love
I got powers in my beads like Mike with his glove
You can't run up on me, I keep MAC around me (no you can't)
Macky, Max and Ronald spray it, get to soundin' (yes it do)
Please don't try your luck, please do not get buck (please do not)
Tell the blogs to listen close, I don't give a fuck
Lil Boat!

[Chorus: T-Pain & Lil Yachty]
They gon' talk about me, they gon' talk about me (yeah)
They can't walk around me, they can't walk around me (no they can't)
Bitch I'm rich as fuck, bitch I'm rich as fuck (bitch I'm rich as fuck)
Them hoes can sick a duck, you can sick a duck (they can suck a dick)
I get 10 Brazilians like I'm Dan Bilzerian (gang, gang)

From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yule-tide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away

Here we are, as in olden days

[Verse 1: Kacey Musgraves]
Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Oh, it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Chorus: The Quebe Sisters]
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm

Christmas, Christmas time is near
Time for toys and time for cheer
I've been good, but I can't last
Hurry Christmas, hurry fast
Want a plane that loops the loop
And I want a hula-hoop
I can hardly stand the wait
Please, Christmas, don't be late

[Outro]
Want a plane that loops the loop
And I still want a hula-hoop
I can hardly stand the wait
Please, Christmas, don't be late
I can hardly stand the wait
Please, Christmas, don't be late

Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say

I'm gonna wrap my presents up in red bandanas
And leave some special cookies out for Santa
Throw my troubles to the wind 'til we're back on the road again
Here's to finding your own little piece on Earth

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves]
And I hope you have a really
A really, really, Willie nice Christmas
If you're in Luckenbach or Waikiki
Yeah, I hope you have a really
A really, really, Willie nice Christmas
And may we all stay higher than the angel on top of the tree

[Verse 2: Willie Nelson]
Don't get caught up in the hustle and the bustle
This time of year ain't supposed to be so stressful
Here's to easily silent nights and finding your own paradise
'Cause whatever family, might call your own

[Chorus: Both]
And I hope you have a really
A really, really, Willie nice Christmas

[Outro: Kacey Musgraves & Willie Nelson]
Happy Holidays from Willie and me
And Merry Christmas, everybody

[Verse 1]
It's all red and gold and Nat King Cole and tinsel on the tree
It's all twinkle lights and snowy nights and the kids still believe

[Refrain]
And I know that they say, "Have a happy holiday"
And every year, I sincerely try
Oh, but Christmas, it always makes me cry

[Verse 2]
It's the ones we miss, no one to kiss under the mistletoe
Another year gone by, just one more that I, I couldn't make it home

[Refrain]
And I know that they say, "Have a happy holiday"
And every year, I swear I sincerely try
Oh, but Christmas, it always makes me cry
Always

[Verse 3]
Seems like everybody else is having fun
I wonder if I'm the only one
Who's broken heart still has broken parts just wrapped in pretty paper
And it's always sad seeing mom and dad getting a little grayer

[Refrain]
And they always say, "Have a happy holiday"
And every year, I sincerely try
Oh, but Christmas, it always makes me cry

[Verse 1: Kacey Musgraves]
We've been moving too fast and we should slow down
Come and sit by the fire, stop rushing around
'Cause this time of year, it's meant for two
So don't leave me lonely if I don't have you

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves]
The holiday's just another day that's cold
Standing all alone under the mistletoe
I don't feel the cheer, ooh, without you here
There's no red and white stripes on a candy cane
And Silent Night just wouldn't sound the same
Where'd the magic go?
All I know is me without you is like a present without a bow

[Verse 2: Leon Bridges]
Before we know, the wreath will come down
The halls won't be decked, there'll be no snow on the ground
The new year will come and bring lots of change, baby
And if I'm not with you girl, sippin' on champagne

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves]
The holiday's just another day that's cold
Standing all alone under the mistletoe
I don't feel the cheer, ooh, without you here
There's no red and white stripes on a candy cane
And Silent Night just wouldn't sound the same
Where'd the magic go?
All I know is me without you is like a present without a bow

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves, Both]
The holiday's just another day that's cold
Standing all alone under the mistletoe
I don't feel the cheer, ooh, without you here
There's no red and white stripes on a candy cane
And Silent Night just wouldn't sound the same
Where'd the magic go?
All I know is me without you is like a present without a bow

[Outro: Leon Bridges & Kacey Musgraves]
Me without you is like a present without a bow, girl
Sit by the fire, we've been moving too fast

[Intro]
Well, here's one for all the little kids
You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all?

[Verse]
Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer had a very shiny nose
Well, and if you ever saw it, you would even say it glowed
(Like a light bulb)
All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names
Oh, they never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games
Oh, then one foggy Christmas Eve
Oh, Santa came to say (Ho ho ho)
Rudolph, with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
Well, then all reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee (Hee hee)
Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer, you'll go down in history

[Outro]
Well, then one foggy Christmas Eve
Oh, Santa came to say (Ho ho ho)
Rudolph, with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
Well, then all reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee (Hee hee)
Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer, you'll go down in history
Yeah, you'll go down, go down in history

[Verse 1]
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
I don't want a doll, no dinky tinker toy
I want a hippopotamus to play with and enjoy
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
I don't think Santa Claus will mind, do you?
He won't have to use our dirty chimney flue
Just bring him through the front door
That's the easy thing to do

[Chorus]
I can see me now on Christmas morning
Creeping down the stairs
Oh, what a joy and what surprise
When I open up my eyes
To see my hippo hero standing there

[Verse 2]
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
No crocodiles or rhinoceroses
I only like hippopotamuses
And hippopotamuses like me, too

[Verse 3]
Mom says the hippo would eat me up
But then, my teacher says a hippo is a vegetarian
There's lots of room for him in our two car garage
I'd feed him there and wash him there
And give him his massage

[Chorus]
I can see me now on Christmas morning
Creeping down the stairs
Oh, what a joy and what surprise
When I open up my eyes
To see my hippo hero standing there

[Verse 2]
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
No crocodiles or rhinoceroses-es
I only like hippopotamuses-es
And hippopotamuses like me, too

[Verse 1]
I can't quit you, baby
Woman, I think I'm gonna put you down for a little while
I can't quit you, babe
I think I'm gonna put you down for a while
I said you messed up my happy home
Made me mistreat my only child

[Verse 2]
You built my hopes so high
Baby then you let me down so low
You built my hopes so high
Then ya let me down, ya let me down, ya let me down so low

[Bridge]
Don'tcha realize sweet, baby?
Woman, I don't know... which way to go

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Woman, I can't quit you, babe
I think I'm gonna put you down for a while

[Chorus]
Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love

[Verse 1]
Don't get me wrong, a shiny new Mercedes would look nice in my driveway
Or a roundtrip ticket for a long vacation on a big fancy jet plane

[Pre-Chorus]
There's only one thing that I want
Baby, it's hard to find and it's already mine

[Chorus]
Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can wrap me up
Ribbons and bows to cure my woes
'Cause I just need your love

[Verse 2]
All the ladies down at the hair salon are gonna brag about what they got
I walk in drippin' in their bobbles and trinkets and their whosits and whatnots

[Pre-Chorus]
There's only one thing that I want
Baby, it's hard to find and it's already mine

[Chorus]
Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can wrap me up
Ribbons and bows to cure my woes
'Cause I just need your love

[Bridge]
Oh, I, I, I just need your love
I, I, I just need your love

[Chorus]
Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, I don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can wrap me up
Ribbons and bows to cure my woes
'Cause I just need your love
When the bells all ring and the horns all blow
And the couples that we know are finally kissing
Will I be with you or will I be among the missing?

Maybe it's much too early in the game
Oh, but I thought I'd ask you just the same
What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?

Wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight
When it's exactly 12 o'clock midnight
Welcoming in the New Year, New Year's Eve

Oh, maybe I'm crazy to suppose
That I'd ever be the one you chose
Out of the thousand invitations you receive

Oh, but in case I stand one little chance
Here comes the jackpot question in advance
What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?

Oh, maybe I'm crazy to suppose
That I'd ever be the one you chose
Out of the thousand invitations you receive
Oh, but in case I stand one little chance
Here comes the jackpot question in advance
What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you, God, God bless you, thank you so much)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen courtrooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Outro: Kanye West & Big Sean]
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bitch, bounce (Yeah)
Is you a real one?
Is you a real one?
Real one
Real one
Is you a real one?
Real one
Real one

Doodle-oo, do, do-now, do-noo
Doodle-oo, do, do-do, do-deh
Doodle-oo, do, do-do, do-do

[Verse 1]
There's a man who swears he's God
But I'm pretty sure he's not
There's a man who walks around
Like he owns the fucking lot
There's a man who takes his time
From the hands of a cuckoo clock
You can hear him walk around
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock

[Refrain]
Do, do, do, do-now, na-num-a
Doodle-oo, do, do-do, do-do
Doodle-oo, do, do-num-a

[Chorus]
At first, it was easy
But now why's it have to be so hard?
Heaven is a fire escape
You try to cling to in the dark
At first it was simple
But now it got too complicated
But the world just got a lovely time
Or blame it all on my mistake

[Post-Chorus]
Maybe I'll find heaven
Might be after dark
Maybe you'll find heaven is a place to part?

Rock the latest fashion so they glancin' when I pass through 'em
You don't fuck with everybody, you ain't gotta lie for 'em
Head to the gang, save that for the lames, for the lames

A nigga a savage, any car that you thought 'bout buyin', I had it

You see the flow, eh dog?
You have to pull it and dash it
Any how she come South
She have to grip it and dash it

[Verse 1: HoodyBaby]
Word around town, it's a drug war
Step into my crib, it's a drug store
I don't need nothin', I just want more
Real dope boy, I took the coke on tour
Take a walk with me, this a plug talk
Funny how this work got me takin' off
Hittin' it for bricks and I make it off
HoodyBaby, I'm the boss cause I paid the cost
Young niggas sellin' coke, I got WiFi
Side bitches suckin' dick from the sideline
Fuck boys, they ain't stickin' to the guidelines
The world is yours nigga, I want mine

[Hook: HoodyBaby]
Classic, did my thing with the coke nigga
Marathon man, I be runnin' with the dope dealers
Sippin' Ace of Spades, gettin' drunk with the gold diggers
100 thousand dollar cross, feelin' like the Pope nigga

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Marathon man, nigga cheatin' like I'm Lance
Last week I was in France, 150 up in Cannes
Say I can't nigga, I can, boy don't make me pull them choppers out
Check my chopper style, send that ass back to your mama house
Bitch, you think I'm playin', I spend 50 thousand on the dance
Ain't no evidence cause the judge ain't find no skeleton
I be runnin' laps in my trap
Ain't gotta be strapped 'fore a nigga take your tap, OHB, bitch

[Hook: HoodyBaby]
Classic, did my thing with the coke nigga
Marathon man, I be runnin' with the dope dealers
Sippin' Ace of Spades, gettin' drunk with the gold diggers
100 thousand dollar cross, feelin' like the Pope nigga

[Verse 3: Luvaboy TJ]
Luvaboy, I tell her what she wanna hear
OHB, that lil hoe, make it disappear
I just wanna hit that pussy from the rear
Have a orgy with your friends just to keep it fair
Spittin' flame, young out can't be tamed, I'm the fuckin' man
Half a pound, break it all down, Edward Scissorhands
Add the boost, molly and the Xans, we in candy land
Stanckin' gingerbread man, catch me if you can

[Hook: HoodyBaby]
Classic, did my thing with the coke nigga
Marathon man, I be runnin' with the dope dealers
Sippin' Ace of Spades, gettin' drunk with the gold diggers

Yeah, I'm feelin' like the Pope nigga
Marathon man, marathon man
Marathon man, marathon man
Marathon man, marathon man

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
It's a battle in this love war
Through the fire, I'm your dragon slayer
Yeah, oh I

Needed more air all along
You don't remember all the love we shared
And you pretend not to care
Girl it tears me up
You've been fallin' in and out of love

Fuck it, I already love her, guess I'll stop fuckin' with bitches
And I won't be all undercover, oh you gon' see lots of pictures, oh yeah
Ever since I saw your photo, I've been doing a whole lotta drinkin'
Got fucked up off the coco, I did it until it was finished
Feel's like a dragon's burnin' in my soul
And I keep on battlin' with this devil on my shoulder

[Hook: Ray J & Chris Brown]
Fuck it, I already love her, already smokin' that killer
Fuck it, I already love her, I turn that girl to a woman

If it ain't about money nigga, you ain't sayin' nothin'

[Verse 1: Ray J]
Pull up to the club 'bout a 100
It's a lotta Pirus and a couple bounty hunters
I'm whippin' in that Wraith with my gunners

Got that meth lab up and runnin'
Rest in peace to the big homie buntry
Rest in peace to young thug, lil homie
From Centerville to Fruit Town, we gettin' money

[Verse 2: Luvaboy TJ]
You don't bang bang, you ain't gang gang
You ain't never slang, choppin' 'caine
With a bad bitch from Spain
Talkin' slang off the promethazine
OHB, bitch, new whip
Stashed with rubber grips
Stackin' chips
Some of my homies Bloods and some bangin' Crips
22 rims with my brims and some lady friends
Stackin' ends, niggas in my way, that's one to the chin
Pockets on swole, I got a bunch of bands on me

Bullets spray, follow the leader
I got homies pullin' up in broad day
And set this bitch off like Keef
Smokin' Khalifa
And you was the one sayin' you ready for war
Now you on the ship, you sound like a bitch
Can't fuck with you boy

The cocaine got her nose runnin'
The strap got 100 rounds in it
If it ain't about money nigga, you ain't sayin' nothin'

[Verse 4: Truth KO]
Pardon me but I don't usually talk a lot
If you ain't talkin' money, nigga what you talkin' 'bout?
The drop head take up multiple parkin' spots
Nowadays gotta keep most shooters in Harvey got
All about my presidents, hustle, never hesitant
Fuck who you invested in cause me, my niggas next to win
Money be my closest kin, I consider it my fam
Keep the drummer like a bam and bein' broke, I never can
Money's all I understand, I speak that shit fluently
Every way, you never there, we call that shit truancy
You speakin' that foolery, this money's nothin' new to me
Ain't worried 'bout who's hot, I was cool before it was cool to be
Fuckin' with a triant god, welcome to the tribe mob
Plus we out here ballin', bang it down like the LeBron lob
Championship rings for me and my fellow squad

[Hook: Ray J & Chris Brown]
Oh you see the new gang comin', new gang comin'

You envious to all my niggas livin' right
You mad cause we can pop bottles every fuckin' night
Poppin' them pills when we chill, for real
Smokin' straight gas, I'mma see you in another life
Bitch I'm blunted, just look at my eyes, I won't fuckin' lie
Catch a vibe, codeine got me leanin', I'm about to slide
OHB, yeah we ride or die, better pick a side
And when I get that pussy, you gon' blame it on the liquor, right?
When you gon' let a real nigga live?
Cause ain't nothin' for me to call up a side bitch
Girl, let a lightskin nigga get up in them ribs
And you can bring your girls, promise I won't fuck them bitches
Damn, you been frontin' on that all night
I gotta leave, come with me on this red eye
She want relationship and I was willin' to pay that tuition
Fuckin' up her decision but I'm in love with the bitches

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, I've tried but I can't, I've tried
Cause I'm in love with these bitches (Oh, no)
Too drunk, had a threesome
They done caught me on cam and got pictures
And we was drinkin' everythin'
What would a young nigga do if it was you?
Damn they done told everythin'
It's real fucked up but I'm in love with the bitches
(Oh, whoa) Cause I'm in love with these bitches
(Oh, whoa, yeah) Cause I'm in love with these bitches

[Verse 2: Young Lo]
I swear I love all these bitches, especially the freak hoes
Line 'em up and knock 'em down like freethrows
Swear I'm young Will, hit 'em with the steal, leave that pussy killed
Lick that kitty, I should leave a hoe bill
Yeah I'm ballin' on point, like it's a milli in the mattress
Wake up every mornin', different bitches in the mansion
Models gettin' high, throwin' whippets in the attic
My nigga burnt out, got these hoes snortin' aspirin
And we gon' throw a party, take the molly, helpin' for the bottles
Eat that pussy, eat that pussy, call me sloppy papi
Swervin' in the newest foreign, ridin' with the carbon
Poppin' your bitch, nigga, why you even need to call him?

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, I've tried but I can't, I've tried
Cause I'm in love with these bitches (Oh, no)
Too drunk, had a threesome
They done caught me on cam and got pictures
And we was drinkin' everythin'
What would a young nigga do if it was you?
Damn they done told everythin'
It's real fucked up but I'm in love with the bitches
(Oh, whoa) Cause I'm in love with these bitches
(Oh, whoa, yeah) Cause I'm in love with these bitches

[Verse 3: Young Blacc]
Let let, let a real nigga hit it
Magnum XL's, only real niggas fitted
Got her walkin' limp cause I gave her the business
Come in to the crib and bust it down with her sister
Slide to the club, 50 deep on that late night
Back to the crib, might eat her cause it's date night
Throwin' bitches texts and tryna give a nigga threesomes
Henny dick goin' so I might as well beast 'em
My niggas be winnin', my side bitches be trippin'
I put that dick in her stomach and then I take 'em to dinner
I'm just playin' to save her, take my strap on the road
I mean what I say cause I love these hoes

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, I've tried but I can't, I've tried
Cause I'm in love with these bitches (Oh, no)
Too drunk, had a threesome
They done caught me on cam and got pictures

What would a young nigga do if it was you?
Damn they done told everythin'
It's real fucked up but I'm in love with the bitches
(Oh, whoa) Cause I'm in love with these bitches
(Oh, whoa, yeah) Cause I'm in love with these bitches

[Intro: Chris Brown]
The man war war
What you say? What you say?

[Hook: Chris Brown]
If I take a life, how can I apologize?
Either it's you or me takin' that journey to the other side
Woah

[Verse 1: Inch]
Them boys some punk, them man get me vex
They ain't bad akh, they just got a bad reflex
About war with war, they can't test with S
That button won't press, the man don't press
Bloodclart, I mix the dope with the bloodclart
A wah da bloodclart, bare jawns in this bloodclart
Look pon me face, my yute
Just can't drop out my zoot, my yute
Gunshot right out the boot, my yute
Look pon my shoe dem my boot, my yute

[Verse 2: Sleeks]
They don't want war
Brap brap, beat up your car
Gang gang on the M way
Man done shut down anywhere fast
Grass, treezy
I'm in Amsterdam gettin' weedy
Whip the work up with Breezy
Still up in the ends, can't see me
Get it in, get it gone
Trap, break a brick with my back
Trapstar but I rap
Got a alleyway full of cats
They don't want war
Them man, they're all talk
Take man's girl on tour
Why you think that she's airin' your calls?

[Hook: Chris Brown]
If I take a life, how can I apologize?
Either it's you or me takin' that journey to the other side
Woah

[Verse 4: Littlez]
They ain't 'bout it, they ain't tarkin'
Move the food like a market
Bro bro with a rare tat
Brap brap in the rocket
Big strap like a car seat
Young dog, you might bark him
We the boys from the back streets
Tell a boy to move cautious
They don't want war
Tell your mate better be calm
Back it out and they back down
Lift the weight, get a pack gone
Trap yard with a bad jawn
On the strip, fuck a lap dance
Ask bro, everything's calm
Your girl wanna take a chance

[Verse 5: Swift]
See a peng girl, yo wagwan
Gang gang, girl I ain't no stank
Take the packs, laugh like ha
Take the what, and left the war
Skrrt skrrt, jump out doors
Uh uh, you don't want war
Bumbaclart, mix it with the rough
Them girl just wanna do talk

[Hook: Chris Brown]
If I take a life, how can I apologize?
Either it's you or me takin' that journey to the other side
Woah

[Verse 6: Deepee]
Uh, I'm with Double 0, I don't need no pass
No cuffin' hoes, the homies dem pass
She suck it whole but might speak with class
Granny titties, them man they're soft
The savage in me, he better not laugh
Get the package empty, them rented cars
Amnes' comin' in plenty
Book me, I be cookie scented
Cause I do the stage and shut down with squa
I'm not sayin' I'm Esco Bar
But I rap hard and I really let go bars
Foreign jawns in my section yard
I'm not a star, but I did guest on far

[Verse 7: Chris Brown]
I'm spendin' money cause a nigga never had it
In my dreams, turnin' niggas into addicts
Top shotta, got the chopper sittin' right under the mattress
The shot out from the gauge of the rusty, but nigga fuck practice
I don't really talk on the phone when I move them things
See them feds, the location change
AKAs are the major pain
Bitch niggas want all the money and fame
But I'll never tell them 'bout the package
Who am I? Bitch, I'm a savage
All of your bitches fanatics
Make the work, do a back flip, I'm doin' gymnastics

[Hook: Chris Brown]
If I take a life, how can I apologize?
Either it's you or me takin' that journey to the other side
Woah

[Verse 8: HoodyBaby]
Coca Cola, my sponsor
Do the math, do the numbers
All my trap goin' bonkers
Play with me, we gon' stomp ya
We suggestin' a turf war
Want respect, you gotta work for it
Word around that the feds on me
I been sellin' dope at my merch store
Plant the seed, watch the earth grow
Play with me, watch your girl go
Kidnappin' can't fix that
6 bricks, that's a 6 pack
2 piece, that's a Kit-Kat
We take the work, we don't get taxed
HoodBaby, my paper good
In the neighborhood where my Crips at

[Verse 1]
These days it's hard to find someone to love
Once you find them you don't wanna give up
And now I know that we're both alone in this
It's just me and you against the world!
And there's me and there's you
It's just me and you gainst the world!

[Verse 2]
Oh, girl!
And what am I supposed to do?
The alarms are going off in my head
And it's dangerous
Yes, it's complicated
We're the only ones who get it
The only ones that want this
The only ones who believe in love!

[Chorus]
It's just the two of us getting into love
It takes two of us to change the world
I've got you, you've got me
It's just me and you against the world!

[Bridge]
Girl, you got me so crazy in longing
And I know it's wrong but so right
And I'm holding you
I have been dreaming
And I can't let you go
Now you're mine!
Girl, what am I supposed to do?
The alarms are going off in my head!

[Chorus] (2x) 

[Fade out to end]

[Intro]
Every body put your peace signs up
Your blunts up, yeah

[Verse 1]
Excuse my mood, my nigga, but I feel a bit Decepticon
Revenge is sweet, years I was shitted on
I'm a cancerous lump in the throat of the game
Any hatin' niggas chemo flow, can never intervene
Already in veins, damn its a note under these shame
Mister skinny jeans, takin' things on another plane
They love it, they need it, and even if I'm never weeded
They will still seek it
I write it on crypt leaf
So the, the people read it, when I'm gone and dead
What is in his head, Complex magazine
Couldn't craft a better sketch of the depths that linger above
I talk to my dads corpse when I'm stoned enough
I be rollin' up, he see me shine see me holdin' up
They wasn't lyin' bout me takin' the train
Before I had the chain catch me on the jmc
I know some niggas hate me, I see you muggin' hard
Ah, you can't deny me, they all salute the underdog
I ain't gotta say it, I'm kinda like a big kid
Yeah

[Hook]
Excuse me, excuse my mood my nigga, yeah
Excuse my mood baby, yeah
Excuse my mood baby

[Outro]
Now, we told you all a year ago
That we weren't playin' anymore
And we mean what we say at dream on GOOD
This is gorilla
You can call me Moon Man
Bow
Peace and love by the way

[Verse 1 : Soulja Boy]
Me and Dex, fucking up a check
God damn all these broke ass niggas starin' at a nigga neck
Fuck on your bitch, she givin' me neck
I'm grippin' the Draco
I'm grippin' the TEC
Shoot a pussy nigga all in his neck
Nigga I'm making it rain, you know that she wet
Smokin' Gelato,  I'm high in the space
Call up my lawyer he beat me the case
150 bricks in the Goyard
Hop in the whip with Givenchy sittin' on my shoe lace
Smokin' on dope and I'm takin' your bitch out the denim
Hit the private jet, me and Kylie Jenner
Draco extended clip and they sprintin'
75 000 diamonds they winter

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Draco, Draco
Don't make me spray with the Draco
Shooters they pull up, you shoot when I say so
Call up lil' Soulja, I ball like Diego
Draco (x23)

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
I never leave with no Draco
My shooters do what I say so
I hit a stain when I lay low
Can't fuck that bitch, swear on God she a fake hoe
(Draco, Draco, yeah, I move with the Draco)
Swear to God boom with that Draco
You run up on me swear to God got my drank on
Ballin' run right to the pesos
Yeah I'm so clean, yeah
Can't fuck these bitches, just scream
Ballin' so hard with no ring, just look at my rings
Look at the diamonds, yeah, all of them shining
Diamonds they dance in the dark
Used to serve right at the park, I trap at the park
A young nigga starved, used to have food but I starved
Bend down that old then I lurk in the dark
Move like I catch you then young nigga bark
(Wait)
Draco, Draco
Boy don't let me call Uno
You know, you know
He'll shoot your ass down with the Draco, yeah!

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Draco, Draco
Don't make me spray with the Draco
Shooters they pull up, you shoot when I say so
Call up lil' Soulja, I ball like Diego
Draco (x23)

[Verse 1]
Spend my time worrying of broken promises
Focused on the smell of all the burnt out cigarettes
My thoughts play on repeat
Only comfort that I keep
'Cause in a moment I will be
Something you will forget

[Chorus]
Hopeless, hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I'm blue, blue, blue

[Verse 2]
Now tell me was I ever something that you could regret
I know I wasn't the one for you
But at least I tried my best
Surrounded by questions like, "Why'd you two part ways?"
But if my memory’s right
You're the one that left

[Chorus]
I'll be hopeless hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I'm blue, blue, blue

[Bridge]
Used to lift me higher
But I guess our time's expired
I'm giving you the match
Set our love on fire

[Chorus]
Hopeless hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I'm blue, blue, blue

[Verse 2 (Reprise)]
Now tell me was I ever something that you could regret
I know I wasn't the one for you
But at least I tried my best
Surrounded by questions like, "Why'd you two part ways?"
But if my memory’s right
You're the one that left

[Chorus]
I'll be hopeless hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I'm blue, blue, blue
Ooh yeah, I'm blue, blue, blue, oh
Yeah, I'm blue, blue, blue

[Intro]
Girl, I just wanna talk to you one time

[Verse 1]
Girl I know that you feel like these dudes out here working you
Girl I just wanna tell you that it is not personal
No no, no no, no no
No no, no no, no no
No no, no no
I just want you to know that it's not personal
Girl I know that you have a lock 

[?]
Girl I just want you to know that it's killing all of them, you so blind
And I want you to know
That it's not personal

Girl I just wanna tell you that it is not personal
No no, no no, no no
No no, no no, no no
No no, no no, no
I just want you to know that it's not personal
I feel like history on the turntables
Old school to new school
Like nothing ever been realer
On the history of the turntables
I’m the mystery of what’s inside the speaker cables
I’m Nina Simone in the park and Harlem in the dark
I’m the musical to the project fables
I’m the words scratched out on the record label
I’m the wind when the record spins
I’m the dramatic static before the song begins
I’m the erratic energy that gets in your skin
And if you don’t let me in
I’m the shot in the air when the party ends

[Intro]
Yeah, ah
Yeah, ah
Yeah, ah
Yeah, ah

[Chorus]
I would pawn you my watch
I would pawn you my chain
I would pawn you this golden diamond ring
'Cause I need it so bad
I would give you everything
Just so I could start my life over again

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you gotta let it go
Just to make it possible
Sometimes you gotta do it, be willin' to lose it
Freedom has no price, you know
Thinkin', "How we gonna make it now?
How we gonna feed the babies now?"
We gon' make it through it
God gon' see to it
Just get up and do it now

[Chorus]
I would pawn you my watch (Hey)
I would pawn you my chain (Hey)
I would pawn you this golden diamond ring (I would pawn you this golden diamond)
'Cause I need it so bad (So bad)
I would give you everything (Yeah)
Just so I could start my life over again (So I could start all over)

[Post-Chorus]
Get on up (Hey)
Get on up (Hey)
Get on up (Hey)
Get on up (Hey)
Get on up

[Verse 2]
See, I learned the hard way
Now I'm doin' it in my way (My way)
'Cause life is too short to fall in New York
Can't get up and get away
So I gotta let it all go
Start back from zero
'Cause I give it up, I don't give a fuck
'Cause love is my hero

[Chorus]
I would pawn you my watch (Hey)
I would pawn you my chain (My chain)
I would pawn you this golden diamond ring (Pawn you this golden ring)
'Cause I need it so bad (So bad)
I would give you everything (Everything)
Just so I could start my life over again (I can start all over)
I would pawn you my watch
I would pawn you my chain
I would pawn you this golden diamond ring
'Cause I need it so bad
I would give you everything
Just so I could start my life over again

[Post-Chorus]
Get on up (Hey)

[Outro]
(So bad, hey-ayy)
(Uh-uh-uh, uh, uh, uh)
(Ayy, ayy)
Okay, can I do one more? It's really quick. So he said, "Blow black mother, black mother." He always announce the title and say, "black mother." This is rap, this is hip hop, this is all that, from the street. Poetry from the street

Black mother, I must confess that I still breathe
Though you are not yet free
What could justify my crying start
Forgive my coward's heart
But blame me not the sheepish me
While I be sleeping in a deep-deep sleep
And I be hazed and dazed and
Vipers fester in my hair
Black mother, I curse your drudging years
The rapes and heart-breaks, sweat and tears
But I swear on siege night dark and gloom
A rose I'll wear to honor you, and when I fall
The rose in hand
You'll be free and I a man
For slave of natural death who dies
Can't balance out to two dead flies
I'd rather be without the shame
A bullet lodged within my brain, black mother

[Intro]
Come on
Feel me
Yes

[Verse 1]
Shame on us, all your sons and your daughters
Thieve all your gold and we poison all your waters
Every piece of our soul is for sale, now they bought us
Think we know it all, then look where it got us

[Refrain]
Oh, mama, mama
Oh, mama, mama
We're cryin' to the wind (Uh)

[Verse 2]
Tryna play God, we been fuckin' with genetics
All that you have given and we only disrespect it
The rate that we're goin', premature Armageddon
That's what gonna happen if we let it

[Refrain]
Oh, mama, mama
Oh, mama, mama
We're cryin' to the wind, mm

[Chorus]
Is there any savin' us?
We've become so dangerous
Is there any change in us?
Even for the sake of love
How you gonna kill your mama?
When only mama's gonna love you to the grave

[Verse 3]
Killin' ourselves, fallin' down with the sickness
Money is the king, it's a dirty bloody business
There will be no trial, but the child will always witness
If we're in love with Hell, why the hell would Heaven visit?

[Refrain]
Oh, mama, mama
Oh, mama, mama
We're cryin' to the wind

[Verse 4]
When mama gets the belt, you gon' wish we didn't do it
Had your chance for redemption, but you fuckin' blew it
Now the weather's changin' and the hurricane is movin'
Right in your direction, what direction are you choosin'?

[Refrain]
Oh, mama, mama
Oh, mama, mama
Forgive us for your pain

[Chorus]
Is there any savin' us?
We've become so dangerous
Is there any changin' us?
Even for the sake of love
How you gonna kill your mama?
When only mama's gonna love you to the grave?

[Outro]
How you gonna kill your mama? Oh
How you gonna kill your mama? Oh

[Outro]
59th Street Columbus Circle, transfer to the 1B-, C-, and the D-train
Brooklyn-bound A. 42nd street is next, stand clear of the closing doors

[Nas]
I already know how to touch you, I already know. Because you gotta always add on, you can't bring, can't just do what was done. You gotta always add on, we always build, we always grow, we elevate. It's by elevation, so, the way I touch this now, it's just gotta be like-- like the gods is like, yeah

[Alicia]
Yeah, they're like oh! He blew my mind!

[Nas]
Yeah

[Alicia]
Wow I think that's a really ill perspective

[Nas]
She was like when I was telling her stuff, oh I can go on too...

[Intro]
You know, right now
I miss someone that I love
Or fell in love with
I don't wanna cry or nothing, but
I'ma just get straight to the story
I'm a twenty-nine year-old addict

[Verse 1]
What would you know? What would you do
If you had no control over what you pursue?
You talk yourself, tell yourself, "Baby, I'm better than this"
All that I'm fightin', I don't wanna resist

[Chorus]
And so it persists like a bottomless kiss
An illusion of bliss, an illusion of bliss
And so it persists like a bottomless kiss
An illusion of bliss, an iIlusion of bliss, hey

[Verse 2]
Live in prison of blood and flesh
An easy way out is this high, I confess
So what you lookin' at? What you wanna say?
You can't save me, baby
I don't want it no way

[Chorus]
And so it persists like a bottomless kiss
An illusion of bliss, an illusion of bliss
And so it persists like a bottomless kiss
An illusion of bliss, an iIlusion of bliss, ah

[Bridge]
See, my life ain't no easy road
I don't know which way to go
Won't somebody see me when I can't see myself?
Won't somebody listen before I need help?
I'm sick of being judged, sick of being sick
Tell me, where's the love?
Tired of bein' tricked
Sick of bein' high, sick of being low
Sick of all the lies, puttin' on a show
And so it persists, and so it persists
Like a bottomless kiss
An illusion of bliss, an illusion of bliss

[Outro]
I don't wanna be a fallen angel
I don't wanna be a fallen angel
Don't say I'm gone, gone
I don't wanna be a fallen angel
Don't say I'm lost, lost
I don't wanna be a fallen angel
Don't say I'm gone, gone
I don't wanna be a fallen angel
Don't say I'm lost, lost
I don't wanna be a fallen angel

[Intro]
Work on it, work on it
Work on it, baby

[Verse 1]
Oh baby, some may think that we moved too fast
But I know you and you know me
Baby, that’s what makes it last
Darling, so many lies were spread about us
Oh, that’s the heartache, that’s the heartache
That makes us build all the trust

[Pre-Chorus]
I know some people like to say
That the easiest way is to fake it
We gonna make it if we try
Gotta promise not to abuse it
If you use it, don’t lose it or break it
’Cause we gonna make it
You and I

[Chorus]
When they see us coming they gon say
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
When they see us coming they gon say
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Some days are hard
There ain’t no easy way
No matter how we try
Nobody is perfect
But if we just… love each other through it all
Baby, now that, that makes it worth it

[Pre-Chorus]
I know some people try to say
That the easiest way is to fake it
We gonna make it ahhh if we try
Gotta promise not to abuse it
If you use it, don’t lose it or break it
We gonna make it
You and I I I I I I

[Chorus]
When they hear us coming they gon say
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
When they hear us coming they gon say
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
When they feel us coming
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
When they feel us coming they gon say
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Outro]
Oh, we gonna work on it, baby
Me and you, we gonna work on it, baby
Man 1: Cocoa butter. You're supposed to put cocoa butter on your whole body -

Man 2: Listen, I'm talking to remove something that you're insecure about! But listen man, are you insecure about anything on you? No! But there's women that's insecure about stretch marks!

Alicia: You insecure about something, what you insecure about? Now you gon' have to share

Man 2: My chipped tooth. I'm insecure about this bunion I got on my foot. Women are insecure about stretch marks, that's why they hide 'em. That's why they say stretch marks are your beauty scars. You just say, you wanna hit someone. Is you gonna hit, the joint you put me on one time was beautiful. Which joint I put you on? listen but her stomach was a prune but I still kissed her!

Man 1: Hold up, listen, listen. This is the thing. If you kissed her stomach and you cut your lip

[Chorus]
When a girl can’t be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world
When a girl can’t be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world

[Verse 1]
In the morning from the minute that I wake up
What if I don’t want to put on all that make up?
Who says I must conceal what I’m made of?
Maybe all this Maybelline is covering my self-esteem
Whose job is it to straighten out my curves?
I’m so tired of that image, that’s my word
What if today I don’t feel like putting heels on?
Who are you to criticize when beauty’s only in the eyes…
Of the beholder, so behold her
Sing, sing, sing, why, oh, oh, oh, why, oh?

[Chorus]
When a girl can’t be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world
When a girl can’t be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world

[Verse 2]
Uh, uh, I’m so secure with insecurities
Why is being unique such an impurity?
Why are the numbers on the scale like a God to me?
All of these indifferences are based on our appearances
We please to be appeased
The truest pleasure is the fact that we can breathe
Think it into existence, do it, then achieve
A fairy tale reality, beauty was with a beast
Ah, ah, ah, I’m the image of your reflection
Uh, uh, uh, you’re the image of my reflection
Sing, sing, sing, why, oh, oh, oh, why, oh?

[Chorus]
When a girl can’t be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world
When a girl can’t be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world
Alicia: I heard this little girl in P.S. 257 yelled out one day to the teacher and said "That shit is whack!" And she stood up in the classroom and walked up from the back and stood in front of the classroom where her history was attacked and said, "You are not niggers. As a matter of fact you are not really even black. I'll prove it to you. I'll put every last one of y'all in a row, put some Vaseline and baby oil in your face and look in the mirror. Look my beloved, you glow."

[Intro]
Uh come on, yes
(What y'all know about that?
...shit's hard)

[Verse 1]
If I could breathe underwater
Every fish would walk on land
If I could fly in the sky baby
Then wings would be on me
If words could move mountains
If I could swim the ocean without drownin'
If there was pain without hurtin'
Then the impossible has been found

[Chorus]
'Cause baby we can do more than we know, more than we know
And baby, baby, oh, there's more than we know, more than we know

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, if I could moonwalk on the moon
I would glide to you baby
I'd go to war like a platoon
I'd be right there on the front lines
No broken promises in the Promised Land
Let's let freedom set us free again

[Chorus]
'Cause baby we can do more than we know, more than we know
And baby, baby, oh, there's more than we know, more than we know

[Bridge]
Uh, yeah, uh
See if we just stayed on the ground
Then we would never see the stars
And if you're too afraid to walk in faith
Then you will never know your heart
And if we just stayed on the corner
Then we would never see the world
'Cause baby there's no fate that you can't create

[Chorus]
'Cause baby we can do more than we know, more than we know
And baby, baby, oh, there's more than we know, more than we know
Baby we can do more than we know, more than we know
(Yeah darlin')
'Cause baby, baby, oh, there's more than we know, more than we know

[Outro]
If we can believe baby
Do you believe it baby
Do you believe in me darlin'?
(More than we know)
Do you trust in me baby?
When I tell you we can do it
Let me show you we can do it
We can go
(More than we know)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(More than we know)
Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, hey, hey, put 'em back up around
Hey, hey, hey
More than we know
'Cause baby we can do more than we know

[Verse 1]
What they gon do 'cause we the same sex?
And we spendin' all this time
This could be the love we ain't made yet
Even though it's on my mind
We ain't even had the conversation
But do you wanna testify?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh
How many know this love song?
How many times it goes wrong?
Goes wrong

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Where do we begin now?
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Where do we begin now?
What we tell our friends now?

[Verse 2]
I had a dream about you last night
Then it kinda blow my mind
All I really know is that it feels right
And I gotta live my life
We ain't even had the conversation
Let me be the first to testify

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh
How many know this love song?
And how many times it goes wrong?
Goes wrong

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Where do we begin now?
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Where do we begin now?
What we tell our friends now?

[Outro]
I gotta let you know, gotta let you know
I gotta let you know
I gotta let you know, gotta let you know
I gotta let you know
Lyrics from snippets:

[Verse 1]
Actin' like a thot bitch
I know you think you hot shit
Saturday pulled a Lamborghini to toxic
Broke ass in somebody's section, you ain't got shit
You tryna flex on me, ho, you need to stop it
Yeah, this party rockin', booty poppin'
In the V.I.P, the section full of options
I remember when we used to be in love
Now you Hollywood, tryna get your name up
Got a little money, you startin' to change up
Listenin' to hoes, tryna get your game up
Used to be your friend, now all I see is danger
When I look at you, all I see is a stranger
No more love, just anger
Now I'm speedin' on the 101, that's 

[?]
You know I be rollin' with the killers and gangbangers
We be countin' money, don't give a middle finger, oh
OHB, we out here ballin' with the top down
Too many diamonds, you can't even turn the lights down
This OG, not a regular nigga lifestyle
Ride the wave, fuck it

[Chorus]
She did it all to make me jealous (Yeah), make me jealous (Oh)
I know you're telling another lie to another guy (Woah)
Baby, you're doing all this to make me jealous (Jealous) make me jealous

[Verse: Travie McCoy]
So we disappear into these last few years
With our broken bones and intertwining tones
And like Indiana Jones, we have become courageous
Outrageous in thoughts and style
Making beats that become feats of the hands and mind
And we learned that not even time can break us
In our place drums
In our confidence and our residence
Every presence is still heard from the first note struck
And the first string plucked
Even when we were down on our luck
And all we heard was "you guys suck"
We persevered
And cleared even our own expectations
Created new vibrations
Started a new buzz
That went from how it is
To how it was

[Intro: Timbaland]
Together never, together, together
Together nev-

[Verse 1: Dalton Diehl]
We were born to fly, limitless
No matter what, we stay up
If we're a team that is enough
No boundaries, we're fearless
Where we go on, we go all
We never break, we never fall

[Pre-Chorus: Dalton Diehl]
In this world that we're creating
Magic's all around
We can fly above the ground

[Chorus: Dalton Diehl]
Hey yeah, we should come together
Let's be heroes in the night (in the night)
Black spotlights beaming in the black sky
We can lift the darkness with our light
'Cause everybody's in harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Everybody's in harmony
Harmony
Harmony

[Verse 2: Dalton Diehl & Timbaland]
Whenever chaos (Kaos) gets crazy
Trouble knocks on the door
With your heart above the floor
Keep shining, yeah, keep trying
If something's wrong we'll be strong
Face your fears until they're gone

[Pre-Chorus: Dalton Diehl]
In this world that we're creating
Magic's all around
We can fly above the ground

[Chorus: Dalton Diehl] 2x
Hey yeah, we should come together
Let's be heroes in the night (in the night)
Black spotlights beaming in the black sky
We can lift the darkness with our light
'Cause everybody's in harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Everybody's in harmony
Harmony
Harmony

[Outro: Timbaland]
All together, harmony
We're all together in harmony
I guess I'm on my... on my Don shit
Somebody gotta do it

Look, no more interviews
I'm not talking about this on a song, feature or interlude
Reporting live from Hawaii with my girl
I brought sand to the beach
Working on vacay in the booth, sand on my feet
I'm from the ground up like a ground-ball play
I'm coming from the underground like it's Groundhog's Day
I'm talking so underground that when I talk about J, nigga
I might mean J Dilla, R.I.P. real niggas
Lately I only do the shit that inspire me
Lately niggas treat the Shade Room like a diary
Oh yeah, is that what you heard?
Believing everything that you hear without confirming it first
And you know the funny thing about it is my ex wanna write a tell-all
Fucked up thing about it is she ain’t even tell all
Like how I introduced her to meditation, positive thinking
And the books she probably read in daily rotation
I learned when people lie on you not to return the favor so
I won’t get you embarrassed
I won’t tell them all the other parts about you that's plastic
This my last time putting my ex in a song even though the last one went triple platinum
I’d rather put that energy into what's worth having
Like how I got a platinum album with no solo tour
Niggas say it's over for me, I go overboard
Back against the wall like my poster but I’m the poster boy
Not from the city if you let THEY tell it
Greatest rapper of all time if you let YE tell it
You ask me, I don’t got the resume yet
But, shit, I can go bar for bar for niggas who talking off
And getting egged on by A&Rs who, soon as your shit fallin’ off, they walkin’ off
And if you rappers diss us and ours just know that you dead and you know it
My career been moving perpetual motion
I'm not impressed with the whoopty woop, I don’t know who is who
And can’t pretend like I’m hip to it, no hula hoop
And I can’t lie like I like this shit like I usually do
And I'm just not impressed by you niggas rapping fast
Who sound like one big asthma attack but trash when I’m rapping it back
Who you put in your top five and claim they the savior of rap

So many friends turn to enemies, they frenemies
I don’t know why I act like I’m surprised or it's offending me
I’m saying, though, I should have learned from Hov and Dame
From Stunna and Wayne, Cudi and YE
What happened to our family ways, though?
When I put you on that song with Nas, you had told me that you was forever grateful 
And that we brothers, so it hurt to hit the internet to find out that me and you don’t fuck with each other 
Over a miscommunication that probably could be fixed with a 5 minute conversation, I’m still praying 

For ya, though, I guess I charged it to the game
How much it cost? Around twenty88
Going off like Kobe when he wore the Crazy Eights
All y’all niggas looking like my kiddos wearing Bape
Shot my first video in the Harajuku store
With Nigo in the background, that's a picture that you can’t take
Yeah with Hype Williams directing each take
And GOD directing each step that we take

I’m a king, a legend, man, you niggas ain't worthy 
10 years in and a nigga still under 30
I’m feeling like an old man that failed at life
Got reincarnated to do it all again right (that's how I feel)
So I’m treating every second like it's an investment 
Time is money, every second I’m collecting 
Don’t ask me no stupid questions 
"Are you still signed to YE?" questions, no Roc nation questions 
Or who I’m dating questions, look, no more interviews 
Unless you wanna talk about the music or something that has a different view
And not the shit that's getting the hits and views
Words misconstrued with no credit, but you niggas approved

My mistakes are my biggest professors and learning life lessons 
I realize it ain’t what you have, it's what you feel, that's what true success is
I am the one of one, after me there's no successor 

DON
For a second, I was in control
I had it once, I lost it though
And all along the fire below
Would rise

And I wish you could have let me know
What's really going on below
I've lost you now, you let me go
But one last time

Tell me you love me
If you don't, then lie
Lie to me
Remember once upon a time
When I was yours and you were blind
The fire would sparkle in your eyes
And mine

So tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me
Just tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me
And call it true
Call it true love
Call it true
Call it true love

[Instrumental Intro]

[Chorus: Belly]
Six inch heel, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness
She worked for the money, she worked for the money
From the start to the finish
And she's worth every dollar, worth every dollar
But she's worth every minute
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
She's stacking money, money everywhere she goes
You know, pesos out of Mexico
De uno, commas and them decimals
She don't gotta give it up, she professional
She mixing up that Ace with that Hennessy
She love the way it tastes, that's her recipe
Rushing through her veins like it's ecstasy, oh no
Then she killed the fucking stage like an enemy

[Chorus: Belly]
Six inch heel, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness
She worked for the money, she worked for the money
From the start to the finish
And she's worth every dollar
Work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
She tricking on herself she don't need a boss
(Don't you know) really ain't a thing to flaunt
(That two door) stunting with the ceilings on
Got these bitches in they feelings cause she paid it all
Used to have a man, wasn't meant to be
Made 100 bands, that's a century
Saving up for plans that would never be
She already made enough but she'll never leave

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
All this money, money, falling from the sky
All this money, money, falling from the sky
All this money, money, falling from the sky
Falling from the sky, f-f-falling from the sky
All this money, money, falling from the sky
All this money, money, falling from the sky
F-f-falling from the sky, falling from the sky

[Verse 3: Belly]
Got a 100 bands I don't need a reason
Tell these bitches it's killing season
200 cash, she don't need a visa
Money, money all she believin'
300 flat, bitch left me freezin'
Balling, balling you play the bleachers
400 down, primp on the beach
Comin' round and everything on fleek

[Chorus: Belly]
Six inch heel, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness
She worked for the money, she worked for the money
From the start to the finish
And she's worth every dollar, worth every dollar
But she's worth every minute

[Outro]
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
But she's worth every minute
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
But she's worth every minute
We’re gonna get it, gonna get it together
We’re gonna get it, get it together and flower

Fixing up a car to drive in it again
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up
Up and up

Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and up
Up and up

See a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, It's in your blood

Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up
Up and up
We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know we’re gonna get it, get it together somehow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and flower

We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know, we’re gonna get it, get it together and float
We’re gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up
Up and up

How come people suffer? How come people part?
How come people struggle? How come people
Break your heart? Break your heart?

Yes I wanna grow, yes I want to feel
Yes I wanna know, show me how to
Heal it up, heal it up

See the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love, Just need love
When the going is rough, saying
We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know we’re gonna get it, get it together somehow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and flower

We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know, we’re gonna get it, get it together and float
We’re gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know we’re gonna get it, get it together somehow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and flower

We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know, we’re gonna get it, get it together and float
We’re gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

[Verse 1]
When you try your best but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

When the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

[Hook]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

[Verse 2]
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

[Hook]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

[Bridge]
Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I...
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I...

[Hook]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

[Verse 1]
Turn your magic on
Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
And we are legends, every day
That's what she told me

[Refrain]
Turn your magic on, to me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds

[Chorus 1]
Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
And I feel my heart beating
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Alive again
Alive again

[Post-Chorus]
If we've only got this life
This adventure, oh then I
And if we've only got this life
You'll get me through

[Verse 2]
Said I can't go on, not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me

[Chorus 2]
Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Oh, I can feel my heart beating
Cause you make me feel
Alive again
Alive again

[Outro]
Woo hoo, woo hoo
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)
Woo hoo, woo hoo
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)
Woo hoo, woo hoo
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)

L: He called me a thief. In public. Had all kinds of people shitting on me for no reason. Then ducked a conversation to clarify or squash it

[Verse 1: Nate Dogg]
When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over
And I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day baby
Just lay back and open your mouth
Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Well if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking endo to smoke
I gets loc'ed and loony
Bitch you can't do me
Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie
I have no love for hoes
That's something that I learned in tha Pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this ho just to lay this ho
I know the pussy's mine
So I'mma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it
There's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck
Why don't y'all pay attention
Approach her with a different proposition
I'm Kurupt ho
You'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch

[Hook]
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon' do?
You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

[Verse 4: Warren G]
Hey now you know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, '64 -- red to be exact
With bitches on my side and bitches on my back
So back up, bitch, because I'm struggling
So get on your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout

[Hook 4x]
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

She's just hurt and in vain
She's between the two

[Chorus]
I put up a fight, it's a light hit

[Verse 2]
As she started to change, I remained the same
I played the game
Not too much, just a stain
I don't mind the wait

[Chorus]
I put up a fight, it's a light hit
I turned my good side in
And as we stayed up, I could feel it
The route, in the road, as the race begins

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I put up a fight, it's a light hit
I turned my good side in
And as we stayed up, I could feel it
The route, in the road, as the race begins

06. Part 6: Aerodynamic (Outro)

[Verse 1]
Sneaking the pillow under the sheets
I know a place where everyone meets
But she knows a place
Where the cops don't go
And she'd be the one if anyone knows

[Pre-Chorus]
If half the fun was to cut and run
And the other half was getting caught

[Chorus]
Then don't stop (don't stop)
She was the daughter of a cop
Don't stop (don't stop)
The daughter of a cop

[Verse 2]
Making love is an easy thing to do
And she didn't feel like pushing herself
But don't be fooled
'Cause it could have been you
Or him or anyone else

[Pre-Chorus]
If half the fun was to cut and run
And the other half was getting caught

[Verse 3]
Then when the fix comes in
She'll get a slap on the wrist
And leave you in a cell to rot

[Chorus]
So don't stop (don't stop)
She was the daughter of a cop
Don't stop (don't stop)
The daughter of a cop

[Outro]
Don't stop (don't stop)
The daughter of a cop

[Hook: Belly]
(Yeah) Six inch heels
She walked in the club like nobody's business
(Nobody's business)
Goddamn
She murdered everybody and I was her witness
She works for the money
She work for the money
From the start to the finish
And she's worth every dollar
She worth every dollar
But she worth every minute
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
She's stacking money, money everywhere she goes
You know, pesos out of Mexico
De uno, commas and them decimals
She don't gotta give it up, she professional
She mixing up that Ace with that Hennessy (Hennessy)
She love the way it tastes, that's her recipe (Recipe)
Rushing through her veins like it's ecstasy (Oh no)
Then she kill the fucking stage like an enemy

[Hook: Belly & The Weeknd]
(Yeah) Six inch heels (Oh baby)
She walked in the club like nobody's business
(Nobody's business; Ooh)

From the start to the finish (Oh baby)
And she's worth every dollar (Worth every)
She work for the money (Work for the)
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
She trickin' on herself, she don't need a boss
Then you know, it really ain't a thing to flaunt
That two door, stuntin' with the ceilings off
Got these bitches in their feelings 'cause she played it off
Used to have a man, wasn't meant to be (Meant to be)
Made 100 bands that's a Century (Century)
Saving up for plans that would never be
She already made enough but she'll never leave

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
All this money, money
Fallin' from the sky (Ooh)
All this money, money
Fallin' from the sky (Ooh)
All this money, money
Fallin' from the sky
Fa-Fallin' from the sky
Fa-Fa-Fallin' from the sky
All this money, money
Fallin' from the sky (Fallin' from the sky)
All this money, money
Fallin' from the sky (Sky-y-y)
All this money, money
Fallin' from the sky (Sky)
Fa-Fallin' from the sky (Sky)
Fallin' from the sky

[Verse 3: Belly]
Got 100 bands I don't need a reason (I don't need a reason)
Tell these bitches it's killer season (It's killer season, it's killer season)
200 cash she don't need a Visa (She don't need a bag, she don't need a bag)
Money, money, ah, she ain't believe it (Money, money, the money, money)
300 flat, bitch, act a freezer
Ballin', ballin', you played the bleachers
400 down, Crib on the beach (Crib on the beach)
Comin' round and they gang gone flee

[Hook: Belly]
Six inch heels
She walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn
She murdered everybody and I was her witness
She work for the money
She work for the money
From the start to the finish
And she's worth every dollar, worth every dollar
But she worth every minute
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
But she worth every minute
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
But she worth every minute

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
You know you was wrong
And you know you fucked up when you left me
And you know that I'm headed so high
Your new guy, your new guy is going so down
Your new guy, you can't bring around me
You can't bring around us
Cause if you do, you found me
You know you was wrong
That's why when you see me on your new TV
You change the channel
Cause you know you was wrong
And now you know that I'm gone
Oh, I'm gone, I'm so gone
And you wish
Oh yeah, you wish that you could return the time
You wish you could rewind
You wish you could rewind my mind

[Verse 2: 070 Shake]
My crew is so fucked up
Take it in and get your doses up
If they ask you, you don't know of us
And they'll go, they'll go so hard for you
Pitty-pitty-pitty
She been asking why all around the city
Don't be asking why, I ain't even kidding
You know what you've done
Giving me your back cause I dont like the front
Now you got some offers I don't need none
You wish, you wish you could rewind the time
LA come all of the lights
Smoke it all up til we dry
We become vamps in the night
Vamps in the night

[Verse 1]
I love it how she breathes booze in the mornin'
Man, it's so sexy how she can't remember last night
I made a fatal mistake of letting her drink again
But who the hell am I to tell her how to live her life?
And if you could put dumb in a shot glass
I'm just another lush who's had one too many in me
And please not enough
I see you stand there, settle for anything, anything's better than lettin' her
Think she could do better than me
She'll come around eventually

Cause baby girl's a queen
But the queen's just a pawn with a bunch of fancy moves
And she's made me a fiend
I'm going through withdrawals but I got nothing to lose

[Hook]
Oh no
She's at the bottom of that bottle
She's only one more swallow
From being, oh, so hollow
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Bravo, she's at the bottom of that bottle
She's only one more swallow
From being, oh, so hollow

[Verse 2]
I find it funny she can never find her car keys
Immediately after telling me she can't take it
She makes the cutest faces when she screams obscenities
And slurs her words because she's never not inebriated
And the front page headline read
"Let the girl go, you know you can do better"
It's bad, when the fact that you can't have her
Is the reason you sweat her
Don't let her take advantage of you
Like the other girls let her
You better cut your losses now buddy

Cause baby girl's a queen
But the queen's just a pawn with a bunch of fancy moves
And she's made me a fiend
I'm going through withdrawals but I got nothing to lose

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Drown yourself, it's not worth keeping me
Just put it down right now and bow out gracefully
(Cause baby girl's a queen
The queen's just a pawn with a bunch of fancy moves
And she's made me a fiend
I'm going through withdrawals but I got nothing to lose)

Thousand pound deal for the So Icey Boys
Gucci Aquarius a So Icy shark
Selling white chalk tryna duck these narcs
Bought some Lowenharts and some D.U.B.'s
34 inch Ashanti's on the Humvee
Whole lot of purp, whole lot of green
Whole heap of white, large amount of beans
Got them collard greens, sell a lot of things

On the drums, Chris Dave
Yeah

[Hook]
Wake me when it's over
I just wanna get my piece up on a heel
Motherfuckers wanna take me for a joker
I'm way too high for a boat deal
I'm too strong for that shit
I'm too grown for that shit
I'm too smart for that shit
I'm too real, yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna lay up, sleeping is for later
Life is what you make it, so let's make the papers
It was but a dream that I was 

[?]
Said you gotta see these from the point of view of elevation
Niece's dedication, I didn't get to make it
But on the freeway racing, I had a revelation
Everything you are is a reflection of the greatest
So you can never be late, there's no mistakes in this creation

[Verse 2]
Uh, you haters can't stand it
I'll sniff a pile of sugar off the crack of a fanny
I'll jumpin' off the roof and parachute in my jammies
Overlooking the city in the midst of a famine
Like where we gon' land this?
Ass on a canvas, frontin' up with cash and
Hand over head with a belly full of scraps

[?], soul like a blackbird, back like a mattress
Get back you bastards

[Hook]
Wake me when it's over
I just wanna get my piece up on a heel
Motherfuckers wanna take me for a joker
I'm way too high for a boat deal
I'm too strong for that shit
I'm too grown for that shit
I'm too smart for that shit
I'm too real, yeah, uh

[Verse 3]
Grew in southern Baptist
Playing on the trap kit
Watching all the pastors, deacons and the grannies
Collecting them offerings, pulling off in them Caddies
I fell in love with a singer, a sensitive Cancer
She told me, "You should sing my nigga, fuck all that rap shit"
I headed to L.A. and started honing my craft, then
Chaffi told me about them boys who drew up the atlas
My nigga, D, he introduced me to Robert Glasper
That nigga on the drums is somewhere living on NASA
I dropped out of class, then
Two weeks passed then I needed extra cash, so
I'm back on the crash course
Playing for them camcorders, singing on a big stage
Nigga since sixth grade, really, ain't shit changed
You gon' have to kill me
I'm here till you feel me
Ain't shit changed
Ninja Turtle P.J.s
Niggas can't kill me
I'm here till you feel me

[Intro]
Ling, ling ling, ling, ling, ling, ling

[Hook]
I got the lingo, ling ling, the lingo
The lingo, ling ling, the lingo
I got that lingo, ling ling, the lingo
The lingo, ling ling

[Verse 1]
I got that lingo, the street lingo I bring yo
Acronology now the society to bring to
Too many people think so
I'm not just an O.G., I'm an Original Hustler, you like, "OH!"
Follow Life's Outcome Willingly, that's FLOW
WISDOM, When I Simply Decide on Moe, or More
I'm bringin' it to raw like a razor
FAITH, Focus And Ignore These Haters
Acronology is dope
Here is another one for FAITH, write it down, "For All It Takes, Hope"
Broaden your scope, it's Tha Teacha', you heard of me
I represent the struggle in the 'hood most certainly
But STRUGGLE's more than a word to me
Here's a Situation That Reminds Us God's Grace Lasts Eternally
LADY, Love And Develop Yourself
HLAW, Health, Love, Awareness, and Wealth
Acronology is not just BRB or Be Right Back
You gotta check the words you usin'
Like RELIGIOUS
It could mean Realizing Every Life In God's Image Offers Useful Solutions
So why you cruisin' lookin' for a snack
Think DIET, "Did I Eat That?"
Put down the cake, Seek Help And Proper Exercise
Rewind that, that spells SHAPE
These definitions go beyond the intellect
Like MIND, "May I Now Direct?"
A new philosophy called acronology
I say it the word, the word inside of me, oh!
The heat is on, you can't leave it alone
This whole thing's created by G. Simone
Even KRS is a acronym
It means, "Knowledge Reigns Supreme," spin it back again

[Hook]
I got the lingo, ling ling, the lingo
The lingo, ling ling, the lingo
I got that lingo, ling ling, the lingo
The lingo, ling ling

[Verse 2]
You can have so much fun with this
You can even take offensive words and give it a twist
Like BITCH, offensive to the ear
Now switch it, "Because I Take Charge Here!"
With acronology, you gotta win
Here's another one for BITCH, "Because I Totally Challenged Him
Or Her," you can't stop the edutainment
'Cause these types of rhymes keep you out of your enslavement
It might not hit you or overstand
I'm takin' you HOME, "Here Our Mind Expands"
So before Departin'  Earth Aimin' for the Heavens
Which spells DEATH, you need to check these life lessons
They like weapons, the foundation is under me
I open up your mind to see how others see
Like GOSSIP, Givin' Out Someone's Secret Information Publicly
Or MUSLIM, May U See Love In Me
I see the CROSS and ask my wife
She says, "it's a Constant Reminder Of Self-Sacrifice"
This is acronology, brothers and sisters
You FAMILY, For All My Intelligence, Love Ya

[Hook]
I got the lingo, ling ling, the lingo
The lingo, ling ling, the lingo
I got that lingo, ling ling, the lingo
The lingo, ling ling

[Intro]
Hi
Remember me?
Back in 2005
I introduced the world
To The Papercut Chronicles
Now I'm back from retirement
To blow your mind once again
But what is a mind?
Is it a simple conglomeration
Of neuron-transmutation
Or a dense emptiness where
Immortal dreams lay to die?
Some say one's mind is a state
But is Pennsyltucky a state?
No, not since 1985
One moon to the next
The selenophobic skies sparkle
Between the darkest of stars
Like the dance of an inanimate sparrow
Wallowing amidst the iridescent shadow
A marsupial fetus bellows beats
Across a melodic menagerie
And with a fleeting slothfulness
The silent sounds of an invisible mountain rise
Below the cloud forest
But if a forest makes a sound
Does a fallen tree hear it?
No one can know, except for those that do
For a cocoon of love is nothing
If not a prison of sorrow
And out of love and sorrow
A callous confusion creeps
Into your conscious
Germinating into the rhythm
Of harmonies never forgotten

[Outro]
Ladies and gentlemen
I give you The Papercut Chronicles Part II

[Verse 1]
I can see the future, we'll be
Living it up inside
Making you feel alright
But I know
We got a little space between us
I know you want me too
And there's something we can do

[Chorus]
Patiently she's sitting there thinking of what she's gonna do
All alone
Anytime you wanna just call me up, and I'll answer you
On the phone

Patiently she's sitting there thinking of what she's gonna do
All alone
Anytime you wanna just call me up, and I'll answer you
On the phone

[Verse 2]
I can feel the pain within you
It's turning your insides out
And filling you up with doubt
Don't you know
How prudent, and I need you feeling
Like you don't mean to pout
Saying that you know what I'm about

[Chorus]
Patiently she's sitting there thinking of what she's gonna do
All alone
Anytime you wanna just call me up, and I'll answer you
On the phone

Patiently she's sitting there thinking of what she's gonna do
All alone
Anytime you wanna just call me up, and I'll answer you
On the phone

[Intro: Future]
If Young Metro don't trust you I'ma shoot you

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the damn job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me cause I’m homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that chick off like an edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be s-shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time mane
(Thank you God, God bless you, thank you so much)

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
How dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything expect worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
They change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Look I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Look I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Yeah fuck what you know
Look I’m takin' back control
The under dog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Aaliyah taught me that if first you don’t succeed
To try again and bounce back
The harder you hit the ground
The higher you bounce
Facts, it’s physics
So many problems systematically we call it the system
Drug dealers and drug users, they both get a sentence
Do the time now every job interview cut to two minutes
Even if you overqualified
Living in a cardboard box
They go bounce you right back in it
Got me wondering what politicians do we got politicking
It concern me
Presidential debates is sounding too personal
My bro reached over like
Man damn what happened to Bernie
I guess primaries wasn’t his primary to get it in
Come November lets see if it happen again
I decided that counting money never feel as good as counting blessings
And a loaded mind is more dangerous than a loaded weapon
I decided for the first time in my life, no second guessing
I decided in this moment in time right now who the best is
I’m the best
Don

[Verse 1]
Hey, turn around, man, I'm gonna take you downtown
You wanna grab the sack, go ahead and do it
My fear of death was set in place by a lie
I glorify you, that's the only way of life, yeah
My teeth were shaking, slowly, surely dissipating
Yeah, the wrinkles on my face, they were from my old age
I try to understand you throwing it away
All your talent down the drain, man, it just makes perfect sense

[Pre-Chorus]
When I look you in the eyes, it takes me right back
Yeah, your future helps me move on from my dark past

[Chorus]
Don't give in
It's not real
You're dead by choice
Choose to feel

[Verse 2]
Your words insane, that old me if I was left-brained
I could understand all your phony logic
I was indifferent, I saw the first time
Come on back, come on back, come on back to get in your life
Yeah, man, it's hard when the local keeps on moving
Got some money and some change, just to wait for my train
I try to stop me, now I'm locked and engaged
Come on back, come on back, come on back and leave your pain

[Pre-Chorus]
When I look you in the eyes, it takes me right back
Yeah, your future helps me move on from my dark past

[Chorus]
Don't give in
It's not real
You're dead by choice
Choose to feel

[Verse 3]
Yeah, we found you laying in your hotel room
With your Bible tied up 'cause you were actin' a fool
We started shaking you all in your bed
Doing everything we could, just hoping that you're not dead
We dragged you out and threw you into our car
Pushed the pedal to the floor, drove to the hospital yard
They brought you in and told us both to wait
I was praying to myself, it's not too late
Yeah

[Outro]
(Leave your bed of concrete)
There are consequences for your actions
There are consequences in real life
(Living hand to mouth)
There are consequences, you can't escape from 'em
There are consequences
(Leave your bed of concrete)
Don't hide behind your reasons
Real life is full of feeling
(Living hand to mouth)
Things come and go in seasons
Truth should transcend our feelings
(Leave your bed of concrete)
Don't hide behind your reasons
Real life is full of feeling
(Living hand to mouth)
Things come and go in seasons
Truth should transcend our feelings

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I stack money like it grow off a tree
My nose up like the police told my gunners to freeze
I'm in a chevy its 100 degrees, but with these grown Giovanni's its a 100 degrees

[So Icey Boy Version]
I stack money like it grow off a tree
My nose up like the police told my gunners to freeze

I stack money like it grow off a tree
My nose up like the police told my gunners to freeze
I'm in a chevy its 100 degrees, but with these grown Giovanni's its a 100 degrees
Got money stashed in a box keep a hundred at least
Four old school verts cost a hundred a piece
100 bricks in the six it ain't easy to breathe
The way these snitches telling on me its so hard to be me
I'm shitting on the industry retarded with me a toilet with me
I should have rolled the short bus cause it's retarded on me
I stank the booth up like a nigga just farted you see
I'm in a quarter mil car, but in the passenger's seat
I keep a top notch rev on to push the beat
And it's chinchilla pink where she resting her feet
And it's straight interior as far you see
I got the whole Boulder Crest and East Atlanta with me

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I think my plug from Outer space man (Space man)

I think my plug is an Alien (An Alien)
Because his number is so crazy man (Crazy Man)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I'm too high, with two twins, and no top with two Glocks
Outside of my trap spot like a Benz lot
Inside of this Benz coupe, look like soup
Terminator, all red, all said, nough said, top's back, seat back, im back, Zay track
71 air dawg and still got that 8 track
Old 8 vette and its squatting like a red
Red rag on me so every day a hair day
Sixteen five every time I hear my ringtone
Money on my mind and my phone is a payphone
One stop, sell more birds than a pet shop
Glock on my hip so I guess I'm not with hip-hop
I got stones on my neck like I went home from bedrock
Push that ganja out like a hood boy with dreadlocks
Jumped in the shower, but my dunk get his rims washed
Open the brain and I got my whole hood high
Went to the mall and I got my whole hood fly
Went to the mall and I got my whole hood fly

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I think my plug from Outer space man (Space man)
I think my plug is an Alien (An Alien)
I beat the dope like a cavemen (A Caveman)

Posted up, fours got stained from everything
Sippy cups, here’s to us and no one else
You’re like me, piece by piece you fall apart
Island home, ain’t a terrible start

[Chorus: Jake, Nathan & Whistler]
Half moon, hey to the daytime
Blueberry knees feeling just fine, yeah
Break up, down in the backyard
This simple season is all ours, yeah

[Verse 2: Jake]
Friendly storms seem to pull us back
Still lukewarm ashtray heart attacks
Daffodils, happy pills, and Harriet strikes

[Chorus: Jake, Nathan & Whistler]
Half moon, hey to the daytime
Blueberry knees feeling just fine, yeah
Break up, down in the backyard
This simple season is all ours, yeah
Lake scene, knee deep in the stars
This simple season is all ours, yeah

[Outro: Jake, Jake, Nathan & Whistler]
Sweet love, kiss on the eyelid
Bruised up, chasing the sky, did
You say something about her
My legs brush up beside her
Too young looking for trouble
New god, lost in the struggle
One more night in the backyard
This simple season
This simple season is all ours
This simple season is all ours
This simple season is all ours
This simple season is all ours

[Verse: Jake]
Say my name
With your sunlight veins
I saw you there, and I swear you haven't changed
With your sunlight veins

[Chorus: Jake]
With your sunlight veins

[Verse 1]
Wisconsin pines, collaborating with the day glow vibes
An altruistic breed of travel guide
It's chill, but Lord knows you're trying
Zombie kids love to hear that easy
Going shit
Grab a guitar and
Just moan and shit
It's cool
But Lord knows you're trying

[Chorus]
That's the way it goes
That's the way it goes
It's so satisfying

[Verse 2]
You put your records on
Exclusively the old Pavement ones
A 90's soul with Doc Martens on
A step, a step away from crying
Degenerate, counter-culture, crying socialist
Hip-to-lazed crazed abstractionists
We're weird, but Lord knows we're trying

[Chorus]
That's the way it goes
That's the way it goes
It's so satisfying
Yeah, that's the way it goes
That's the way it goes
One step away from crying

[Bridge]
Yeah, that's the way it goes
That's the way it goes
Yeah, and that's the way it goes
That's the way it goes

[Chorus]
That's the way it goes
That's the way it goes
It's so satisfying
Yeah, that's the way it goes
That's the way it goes
One step away from crying

[Outro]
Ah, ah
Ah

[Verse 1: Jake]
I see meaning where you don't, where you don't
I see waves of pastel orange and yellow paintings fire
I see futures that you won't, that you won't
I see futures where our nights are lost to condensation

[Chorus: Jake & Nathan]
Night time in the basement
Screaming about our feelings
Running through the cold air
Searching for a meaning
Passed out on the concrete
Dizzy from the spinning
Wake up to the feeling that everybody's leaving

[Verse 2: Jake]
I'm sick of your comedowns
Sick of your truce
Sick of your way
I'm sick of your tragedy that's living in our stasis
I'm sick of your echoes
Sick of these ghosts that haunt our place
I get a feeling that I'll never leave this house again

[Chorus: Jake & Nathan]
Night time in the basement
Screaming about our feelings
Running through the cold air
Searching for a meaning
Passed out on the concrete
Dizzy from the spinning
Wake up to the feeling that everybody's leaving
Everybody's leaving
Everybody's leaving

[Bridge: Jake, Whistler,  Jake & Nathan]
Failed by design, slow your pace down to mine
Watch my back, heave a sigh
Keep it safe, make it right
Failed by design, slow your pace down to mine (Soulful vines)
Watch my back, heave a sigh
Keep it safe, make it right (Soulful vines)

[Chorus: Jake & Nathan]
Night time in the basement  (Failed by design)
Screaming about our feelings
(Slow your pace down to mine)
Running through the cold air
Searching for a meaning
Passed out on the concrete (Watch my back, heave a sigh)
Dizzy from the spinning
(Keep it safe, make it right)
Wake up to the feeling that everyone is leaving

[Verse 1: Jake]
I'm blind and afraid
The colors of this sound like a shape
The feast of words you never could say
And I'm torn apart
In this sun, there is red
The epitaph of an old record player
The sweetness in the salt of her hair
And there's no decision

[Verse 2: Jake]
I knew a girl once
There were splinters from her thoughts
Unless you knew a god
With kindness in her heart
You're a dark one
With a knack for pushing boys off a cliff
And the messy eyes of ink-splattered fits
And it's all found in a page

[Chorus: Jake & Nathan]
I need nothing more than my problems
Just let me know when you've found them
You've got mirth and I've got snow hands
Eyes fell and haven't come up since

[Post-Chorus: Jake & Nathan]
Mary
Dare me, scare me
Oh Mary

[Bridge: Jake]
I know a place out beyond these pines
Where the sky falls down with the cumulus cries
A winter song for a January type
I could tame my heart
I could blind my eyes
The river is an organ
And the meadow is a church
For a strange inclination
That fortune is a curse
I'm a cryptic writer
I'm an ignorant fool
I'm a poor excuse for poetry
Trying to play it cool
I'm just trying to play it cool

[Pre-Chorus: Jake]
I need nothing more than my problems
Just let me know when you've found them
You've got tact and I've got bravado
I'm a ghost and you are a shadow

[Chorus: Jake & Nathan]
I need nothing more than my problems
Just let me know when you've found them
You've got mirth and I've got snow hands
Eyes fell and haven't come up since

[Post-Chorus: Jake & Nathan]
Mary
Dare me, scare me
Oh Mary

[Verse 1: Jake]
See how the western kids
Have silicon inside their lips
A mask or an artifice
For the love that their parents give
The northern girls they play the part
With painted face, they're works of art
I swear to god I felt it then
The perfumed aura of wine and gin

[Chorus: Jake, Jake & Nathan]
I just love this I swear I'll go viral
From the 'burbs to the streets now, it's a revival
The spirit is found in the idealistically idle
The age of excess
And I just love it
I just love it
I just love it

[Verse 2: Jake]
The Midwestern plains recall
Firearms and alcohol
The proxy-server kind of men
The socialites their brooding hens
The silhouettes they play the part
Their east coast digs are works of art
But the sickness sleeps inside our bones
With solipsistic overtones

[Chorus: Jake, Jake & Nathan]
I just love this I swear I'll go viral
From the 'burbs to the streets now, it's a revival
The spirit is found in the idealistically idle
The age of excess
And I just love it
I just love it
I just love it

[Verse 1: Jake]
Mary packed her bags and left home on a Christmas Eve
For sea soaked skies and dashing lads with cars
An actress orphaned by the social constructs of her art school
A victim of their esoteric rule
So pretentious that she almost thought it cool
But all you'd hear is

[Chorus: All]
La, la la la la
La la la la la, la la
La, la la la la
La la la la la, la la

[Verse 2: Jake]
Purpose was a vague ideal that she would always talk on
Till she fell in love with the salesman from TV
Yeah, she fell in love with a salesman from TV
While all of Hollywood sang

[Chorus: All]
La, la la la la
La la la la la, la la
La, la la la la
La la la la la, la la

[Bridge: Jake, Jake & Nathan]
Pearly, pretty prize, and a ribbon box of sighs
In a collared shirt
She thought it wouldn't hurt
Certain love of mine with the palest blue eyes
In her collared shirt
I thought it couldn't hurt
Wood flavored kiss taste the concrete of this
It really fucked with me, it really fucked with me
California eyes are a death wise from design
You really fucked with me

[Verse 1: Jake]
Just two days after the first of June
A pine with arms brushing off the dew
Unlike a sky copious with death
Precipitation of heart and head
Should wash the rest of her youth away
And carry on with it as she may
But something's pending curvaceously
'Cause sunburned skin won't agree with me

[Refrain: Jake & Whistler]
It should've been me
It should've been me
It should've been me
It should've been me

[Verse 2: Jake & Whistler, Nathan, Jake & Whistler]
The pleasure's good as the pleasure's sound
Chin held shut so my heart can talk louder
I was a mess just like the pool
Our days spent crossed out of Sunday school
July has always been shy of June
Some monsoon, monsoon, monsoon
Come heavy of a golden hue
My monsoon monsoon, monsoon
Monsoon, monsoon
Monsoon, monsoon
Monsoon, monsoon
Monsoon, monsoon

[Refrain]
It should've been me
It should've been me
It should've been me
It should've been me
It should've been me
It should've been me
It should've been me
It should've been me

[Verse 1: Jake]
My thoughts are a battlefield of sub-surreal and unfamiliar
Dropping hallucinogens to find serene with oak and cedar
With all that's fell in our laps
You'd think that peace would come and find us
I struggle to see a point of searching for the walls beside us

[Verse 2: Jake]
There's fickle roads that fade
To paths of sage and signs delivered
Smoking grass to find our facts while hopes decay and wither
I'll take out my lighter to see in dull and dark juniper evenings
I'll burn the field to yield a sign of biblical proportion

[Chorus: Jake & Nathan]
Your friends are all waiting
Your friends are all waiting for you, love
Your friends are all waiting
Your friends are all waiting for you, love

[Bridge: Jake]
I'm not staying anymore
I'm two steps in and two steps over it
I've had my time in present tense
I'm taking vacations where vacancy's permanent
I'll find the inner tranquil there
I hear you've seen her over the mountain
But I'm not standing anymore
I'll vacate my body and find a direction
I'll vacate my body and find a direction

[Chorus: Jake & Nathan]
Your friends are all waiting
Your friends are all waiting for you, love
Your friends are all waiting
Your friends are all waiting for you, love
Your friends are all waiting
Your friends are all waiting for you, love
Your friends are all waiting
Your friends are all waiting for you, love

[Outro: Jake, with Nathan & Whistler]

[Chorus: Jake, Nathan & Whistler]
I’ll be fine on my own, she said, I don’t need you inside my head
(She’ll be fine on her own, she'll be fine on her own)
I'll be fine on my own, she said, all my love's wrapped in shades of red
(She’ll be fine on her own, she'll be fine on her own)

[Verse 1: Jake, Jake & Whistler]
No holds barred in the ring so you'll fight me
Give 'em hell, give 'em teeth like you taught me
Tireless mess, seeking thrills, getting bitey
When I'm in doubt
Pudgy face, kissing lace in the backseat
Wrinkled toss of the coin that I can't see
Punch forget out of you to be like me
Where around is enough for a family

[Chorus: Jake & Nathan, Nathan & Whistler]
I’ll be fine on my own, she said, I don’t need you inside my head
(She’ll be fine on her own, she'll be fine on her own)
I'll be fine on my own, she said, all my love's wrapped in shades of red
(She’ll be fine on her own, she'll be fine on her own)

[Verse 2: Jake, Jake, Nathan & Whistler]
Growing pains, splaying rain on the high sea
Scale a tree, snap a branch so you can't leave
On the ground, lost and found, understand me
Putting words in my mouth, tryna get free
Solid punch, kind of eyes, make ‘em wobbly
Gothic vine, growing fire in the lobby
Lighten up, buttercup, get a hobby
Yeah, swing, sucker, swing, finish sobbing

[Bridge: Jake]
She’ll be fine on her own... she’ll be fine on her own
She’ll be fine on her own... she’ll be fine on her own
She’ll be fine on her own, she said
She’ll be fine on her own, she said
She’ll be fine on her own, she said
She’ll be fine on her own, she’ll be fine on her own
She’ll be fine on her own, she’ll be fine on her own

[Verse 3: Nathan & Whistler,  All]
I'll be fine, I'm alright, it’s my body
Gonna stick to my guns like you taught me
Holy hell, I can tell that you hate me
Dying moon, keep me up, keep me waiting
I'll be fine, I'm alright, it’s my body
Gonna stick to my guns like you taught me
Holy hell, I can tell that you hate me
Dying moon, keep me up, keep me waiting
Dying moon, keep me up, keep me waiting

Burr, aha, it's Gucci
During the pirate attack on Plastic Beach, 2D hid in his underwater quarters. Unwittingly he'd made himself prey to a far fiercer foe: a great white whale known as Massive Dick (weirdly, no relation to Moby). The blubbery beast swallowed 2D in one bite, and swam into the deep.

But a lifetime spent eating ocean garbage – and now 2D – took its toll on Massive, and he died. His carcass washed up on a desert island, where 2D was finally free... to die of starvation, due to a total lack of survival skills. Unable even to catch crabs (which was more Murdoc's forte), 2D had no option but to eat his former host. Rancid whale blubber for breakfast, lunch and dinner. With a side of sand.

Several months later, 2D spotted a plane flying along the coast. Moved to tears by this beacon of hope, he set off in its direction. Twenty-three minutes later he was in the middle of a full-scale beach rave. It turns 2D wasn't marooned at all. He had in fact landed on Guadalupe, off the Mexican coast. 2D joined the beach party, ate some strange-tasting brownies, and came third in the wet T-shirt contest.

As he claimed his prize, 2D had a eureka moment. He would have a gap year and find himself. It turned out finding himself was really easy – he was right there. But he stayed the rest of the year anyway, until he got sacked from his job weaving friendship bracelets. It was time to fly home.

At Heathrow, a man at arrivals held up a sign saying 'Wanker'. 2D followed him to his car, which drove him to West London, where he was reunited with Murdoc, Russel and Noodle. Gorillaz were back.

[Verse 1]
I've made mistakes
I could have treated you better
I let you get away
There goes my happily ever after

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me why, why can't we try and start again?
This can't be how our story ends
You're more than my girl, you're my best friend
Tell me you remember when
Ooh, I was your man and you were my girl
It was you and me against the world

[Chorus]
Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
Tell me, what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm still in love with you, darlin'
I know you feel the same
Oh, what's the point of both of us being broken-hearted?
I pray it's never too late

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me why, why can't we try and start again?
This can't be how our story ends
You're more than my girl, you're my best friend
Tell me you remember when
I was your man and you were my girl
It was you and me against the world

[Chorus]
Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
Tell me, what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye

[Bridge]
(Oh, don't you give up)
Girl, won't you listen?
(Don't you give up)
It's you that I'm missin'
(Don't you give up)
Take my hand, I wanna go, I wanna go
(All the way)
If we're gonna fight this fight for better days
I know we're gonna make it
This is the chance, let's take it

[Chorus]
Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
(Woo, no, no, no, no)
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
(Ooh, tell me)
Tell me, what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye
(Come on, come on)
Goodbye (Oh baby, baby)
Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
(Oh, tell me)
Tell me, what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 1]
Let's take our time tonight, girl
Above us all the stars are watchin'
There's no place I'd rather be in this world
Your eyes are where I'm lost in
Underneath the chandelier
We're dancin' all alone
There's no reason to hide
What we're feelin' inside
Right now

[Pre-Chorus]
So, baby, let's just turn down the lights
And close the door
Oooh I love that dress
But you won't need it anymore
No, you won't need it no more
Let's just kiss 'til we're naked, baby

[Chorus]
Versace on the floor
Oooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Versace on the floor
Oooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl

[Verse 2]
Now I unzip the back to watch it fall
While I kiss your neck and shoulders
No, don't be afraid to show it all
I'll be right here ready to hold you
Girl, you know you're perfect from
Your head down to your heels
Don't be confused by my smile
'Cause I ain't ever been more for real, for real

[Pre-Chorus]
So just turn down the lights
And close the door
Oooh I love that dress
But you won't need it anymore
No, you won't need it no more
Let's just kiss 'til we're naked, baby

[Chorus]
Versace on the floor
Oooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Versace on the floor
Oooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Dance

[Bridge]
It's warmin' up
Can you feel it?
It's warmin' up
Can you feel it?
It's warmin' up
Can you feel it, baby?
It's warmin' up
Oh, seems like you're ready for more, more, more
Let's just kiss 'til we're naked

[Chorus]
Versace on the floor
Hey, baby
Take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Versace on the floor
Oooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl

[Verse 1]
I count my time in dog years
Swimming in sevens
Slow dancing in seconds
Oh, and I'm the one that loves you
Oh, and I'm the one that loves you

[Verse 2]
I spend my time daydreaming
As sure as the sea
It's just you and me
Oh, and I'm the one that loves you
Oh, and I'm the one that loves you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And if you had a bad week
Just let me touch your cheek
Oh, and I'll be there waiting
When you get frustrated
I know things are changing
But, darling, I'm saying
I'll be singing you in all of my songs

[Chorus 1]
Come what may
I'll still stay
Inside your mind
For all of time
Singing, ooh
We will be alright
In the afterlife

[Verse 2]
Of all that is shifting
And shaking my system
I know your rhythm
And I know, I know, I know, I know
That I'm the one that loves you
Oh, and I'm the one that loves you

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you had a bad week
Then I'll sing you to sleep
Oh, and I'll be there waiting
If you start to get jaded
I know things are changing
But, darling, I'm saying
I've been here all along

[Chorus 2]
Come what may
I'll still stay
Inside your mind
For all of time
Singing, ooh
We will be alright

[Chorus 3]
Not in vain
We'll still stay the same
Inside your mind
For all of time
Singing, ooh
We will be alright
In the afterlife
In the afterlife

[Outro]
I count my time in dog years, dog years, dog years, dog years, dog years
We will be alright (Dog years, dog years)
We will be alright (Dog years, dog years)
In the afterlife  (Dog years, dog years, dog years, dog years)
Singing, baby, we will be alright (Dog years, dog years)
We will be alright
We will be alright

[Verse 1]
Ooh, don't we look good together?
There's a reason why they watch all night long
Yeah, I know we'll turn heads forever
So tonight, I'm gonna show you off

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm walkin' with you
I watch the whole room change
Baby, that's what you do
No, my baby don't play
Blame it on my confidence
Oh, blame it on your measurements
Shut that shit down on sight
That's right

[Chorus]
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it

[Verse 2]
Now slow it down for me, baby (Slow it down, girl)
'Cause I love the way it feels when we grind
Yeah, our connection's so magnetic on the floor
Nothing can stop us tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm walkin' with you
I watch the whole room change
Baby, that's what you do
No, my baby don't play
Blame it on my confidence
Oh, blame it on your measurements
Shut that shit down on sight

You know it, you know it
In 1974 I played the first of many shows with the Band—maybe in eight years. We were in a hockey arena in Chicago. There were maybe 18,000 people there. The Band and I hadn’t played publicly together since 1966 where our shows caused a lot of disruption and turmoil—a lot of anger. Now we were in Chicago starting up again. There was no way to predict what was going to happen. At the end of the concert we had played over 25 or 30 songs and we were standing on the stage looking out. The audience was in semi-darkness. All of a sudden, somebody lit a match. And then somebody else lit another match. In short time, there were areas of the arena that were engulfed in matches. Within seconds after that, it looked like the whole arena was in flames and that all the people in the arena had struck matches and were going to burn the place down. The Band and I looked for the nearest stage exit as none of us wanted to go down in flames. It seemed like nothing had changed. If we thought the response was extreme on the earlier tours we played, this was positively apocalyptic. Every one of us on the stage thought that we’d really done it this time—that the fans were going to burn the arena down. Obviously we were wrong. We misinterpreted and misunderstood the reaction of the crowd. What we believed to be disapproval was actually a grand appreciative gesture. Appearances can be deceiving.

For this series of paintings, the idea was to create pictures that would not be misinterpreted or misunderstood by me or anybody else. When the Halcyon Gallery brought the idea of me doing American landscapes for an exhibition, all they had to do was say it once. And after a bit of clarification, I took it to heart and ran with it. The common theme of these works having something to do with the American landscape—how you see it while crisscrossing the land and seeing it for what it’s worth. Staying out of the mainstream and traveling the back roads, free-born style. I believe that the key to the future is in the remnants of the past. That you have to master the idioms of your own time before you can have any identity in the present tense. Your past begins the day you were born and to disregard it is cheating yourself of who you really are.

My idea was to keep things simple, only deal with what is externally visible. These paintings are up to the moment realism—archaic, most static, but quivering in appearance. They contradict the modern world. However, that’s my doing. The San Francisco Chinatown street stands merely two blocks away from corporate, windowless buildings. But these cold giant structures have no meaning for me in the world that I see or choose to see or be a part of or gain entrance to. If you look half a block away from the Coney Island hot-dog stand, the sky is littered with high rises. I choose not to see them either. Down the road, across the highway from the Cabin in the Woods is a manicured golf course. But it has little meaning compared to the seemingly worthless shack which speaks to me. The Alabama Side Show is surrounded by woods in all directions. The side show happens to be in a clearing and you go there by dirt road. I chose to paint the side show instead of the endless woods. There are countless other works where this is also true.

All the iconography is used in a semi-conscious way. I chose images because of the meanings they have for me, and patterns can be seen in the repeating images—roads, shacks, piers, automobiles, streets, bayous, railroad tracks, bridges, motels, truck stops, power lines, farmyards, theater marquees, churches, signs and symbols, etc.—all establishing a certain type of compositional value. I would say the purpose is plain, non-experimental or exploratory.

Some of these works have much complexity of detail. Some are less demanding . . . in some cases my hand couldn’t do what my eye was perceiving. So I went to the camera-obscura method. The camera obscura was a primitive camera invented in the 1600s which projected an image upside down so the painter could work from it. This was a real camera, but the image was not printable. It could only be seen and filled in. Caravaggio used this in about all of his paintings and so did Van Eyck and Vermeer. These days you don’t have to go to all that trouble. You can use a real camera. I put a 58-mm 0.43x wide-angle conversion lens onto a used Nikon D3300 Af-p on quite a few paintings, Downtown Bank, Katz’s, Nathans, Russ & Daughters, Roy’s, Blue Line, among others, and was able to get the desired effect. If that didn’t work, I used a convex Plexiglass RCA 24 x 20 television screen that can be found in old junk shops and looked at the world through that. On Curry Road in Arizona, I used an old movie frame, and I did that on a couple of different paintings, too. In just as many others I drew it straight on. Topanga Ranch, Ice Cream Factory, Truck Stops, Flat Top Mt. Diner, and Del Rio Cantina. The method with the particular altered lens was used for fullness of effect. In a lot of the other cases, all I needed was a straight edge, compass, and a T square going on a case-by-case basis without abandoning tradition or adhering to any conventions or aesthetic doctrines.

The watercolors and acrylics done here purposely show little or no emotion, yet I would say they are not necessarily emotionally stringent. The attempt was made to represent reality and images as they are without idealizing them. My idea is to compose works that create stability, working with generalized, universal, and easily identifiable objects. Throughout, there is the attempt to depict scenes of life and inanimate life for their own sake (Ice Cream Shack, Arcade, Threatening Skies). Da Vinci paints a blurred picture—you see no lines but clouds that fade into one another with different color schemes. An opposing view would be Mondrian and Van Gogh with strict lines that define the volumes of space. In the middle somewhere would be Kandinsky and Rouault. And these paintings would probably fall into that category.

An attempt was made to depersonalize the works—strip them of illusion. All the work is exclusively placed in non-exotic settings within a rationally defined space. The focus points are important and sometimes unusually placed. Background and foreground not easily defined. In Amusement Park Alleyway, the focus point is the Ferris wheel in the background. The orange Chevy truck might be centered in the foreground but it’s not the focal point. In Morning in Pittsburgh, the focal point would be the bridge in the background instead of the larger warehouse in the foreground. Just like in the Flat Top Diner, the focal point might actually be the green trees.

I tried to create the two dimensional image using a mathematical system. At times, the background and foreground converge. Natural scenery is always the main feature. These are not crowded compositions. They are using basic structures to express feelings and ideas. Perfect proportion and logic instead of emotion. The nature of beauty, the lines, forms, shape, and texture that emphasize the recognizable create harmony where natural scenery is the main feature.

I restricted myself to traditional subject matter, viewing nothing as shallow or gaudy. A simple hot-dog stand can have classical features, and I view it as such (Donut Shop, High Wire). Whiplash curves, flying buttresses, pointed steeples, arches, and waves. They are all there, reflecting any time period, purposely trying to stay away from dramatic or theatrical lighting effects, bringing naturalism to the forefront.

In some paintings, the brightness of reflected light was brought forth in evident brushstrokes. Sometimes sunlight hitting certain places would contrast deeply with areas of shadow (Sunset on the Prairie, Threatening Skies). I tried to avoid skewed perspectives or man-made light, yet sometimes it couldn’t be avoided. An expert painter is a master in color theory, which means he can turn white into black using a complex value system of colors and hues like a Mark Rothko. “The Beaten Path” however, reflects explorations in color, sometimes using colors that become less pronounced and outlines that become less precise. Other times tipping toward the monochromatic (Oil Rigger’s Shack, Twilight After Dusk).

Flowing or curved lines form another visual vehicle, suggesting a far distance in a landscape painting. Architecture itself is always a vital source of ideas and inspiration, but, always, “The Beaten Path” tries to return to the traditional methods of perceptions—things that are perceived in the visible world—taking the three dimensional into a two dimensional format using contrast, location, isolation, and convergence.
If there is a soundtrack to this compilation of paintings, I would say it could be recordings by Peetie Wheatstraw in some places, Charlie Parker in others, Clifford Brown or Blind Lemon, maybe Guitar Slim—artists that make us a lot bigger when listening to them. It would have to be that way. Absolutely.

There was a conscious attempt to dismiss consumer culture or popular culture, including mass media, commercial art, celebrities, consumer or product packaging, billboard signs, comic strips, magazine advertising. “The Beaten Path” works represent a different subject matter from the everyday imagery of consumer culture. There is nothing to suggest these paintings were inspired by the writings of Sigmund Freud or that they were based on any mental images that occur in dreams, no fantasy worlds, religious mysticism or ambiguous subject matter. In every picture the viewer doesn’t have to wonder whether it’s an actual object or a delusional one. If the viewer visited where the picture actually existed, he or she would see the same thing. It is what unites us all.

Came into this world, daddy's little girl
And daddy made a soldier out of me
Oh, oh, oh
And daddy made me dance and daddy held my hand
And daddy liked his whiskey with his tea

With his gun and his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot

Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held me in his arms and he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone, "Here's what you do
When trouble comes to town and men like me come around"

Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it

[Verse 1]
Theodosia writes me a letter every day
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
Well he can keep all of Georgia
'Cause Theodosia, she's mine

[Chorus 1]
Love don't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep lovin' anyway
We laugh and we cry and we break
And we make our mistakes
If there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
I'm willing to wait for it
Then, I'm willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it

[Verse 2]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher, preacher, preacher, preacher
But there are things that the homilies and hymns won't teach ya, teach ya, teach ya, teach ya
My mother was a genius, genius, my father commanded respect, respect
When they died they left no instructions, just a legacy to protect

[Chorus 2]
Death don’t discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
Yeah, we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break
And we make our mistakes
If there’s a reason I’m still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I’m willing to wait for it
Then I’m willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it...

[Bridge]
(Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it)
I am the one thing in life I can control
(Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it)
I am inimitable, I am original
(Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it)
I am not falling behind or running late
(Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it)
I am not standing still, I am lying in wait
(Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it)
Everyone faces an endless uphill climb
You got something to prove, you got nothing to lose
Everyone’s pace is relentless, you waste no time, time
What is it like in his shoes?

[Chorus 3]
Life don't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
Taking me, taking me, taking...
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break
And we make our mistakes
But I know there's a reason I'm alive
So many have died
And I'm still waiting for it
I'm willing to wait for it

[Chorus 2]
Life don’t discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break
And we make our mistakes
If there’s a reason I’m still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I’m willing to wait for it (Yes I am)
I’m willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it

[Outro]
I’m willing to wait for it
I’m willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it
I’m willing to wait for it
I’m willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it
I’m willing to wait for it
I’m willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it
I’m willing to wait for it
I’m willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it

[Intro]
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around…
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around…

[Verse 1]
Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you’re alive is a miracle
Just stay alive
That would be enough
And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough

[Bridge]
I don’t pretend to know
The challenges you’re facing
The world's you keep erasing and creating in your mind
But I’m not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough

[Verse 2]
We don’t need a legacy
We don’t need money
If I could grant you peace of mind
If you could let me inside of your heart…

[Bridge]
Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
The story you will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter
Where you decide to stay

[Chorus]
And I would be enough
And this could be enough
This would be enough
Said, I would be enough
And this could be enough
See, we could be enough
Oh baby
I could be enough
We could be enough
This could be enough
Oooh

Don't look no further, (No further)
Don't go nowhere
I could be enough, (I could be enough)
We could have it all
Tell me baby (baby)
Can you feel me? (Hey)
Can I be enough? (Can I be enough?)
And your family? (Me and your family?)
Listen, baby (Listen, baby)
We can have it all; (We could have it all)
Can I be enough? (Can I be enough?)
Yeah
Woo

[Outro]
So look around, look around
At how lucky we are to be alive right now
Look around, look around…
Look around, look around
At how lucky we are to be alive right now
Look around, look around…
Baby
Darling
Oooh
Well I hear my freedom calling
Calling in the wind
Well I hear my freedom calling
Calling all of my friends

[Intro]
Oh

I mean
I do got it made but
That's 'cause I made it myself
Gang Gang

[Verse 1]
Uh, people be all in my face
Wasn't the time and the place
Do interviews and I'm on stage
'Cause baby I gotta get paid
Don't matter what most people say
'Cause all of 'em get in the way
I'm working with more than I play
Which mean I'm gon' be here to stay
I roll me one up and I blaze
And take a tree straight to the face
Those thuggers keep hoping I change
But no, I'ma stay in my lane
I'm smelling like weed on the plane
And white people think it's a shame
As soon as they mention my name
They go back to being the same

[Pre-Chorus]
I did everything that I want (uh)
I still don't really care what anybody else think
Now I can have anything, I ain't gon' stunt
And I don't feel bad 'cause I did it my way
And now they all say

[Chorus]
"It must be nice, it must be nice
To have them Washingtons on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have everybody on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have them Washingtons by your side
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have everybody by your side"

[Verse 2]
Whether you coming or leaving
Know everybody be talking
Nigga be having a problem
Straighten up soon as you walking
Some of them familiar faces
Fame is so easy to get lost in
So many different motives
If you slip up it'll cost you
Don't know who got your best interest
But you don't stop, you keep going
They really talking, you live it
When the time come you gon' show it
Keep on my heart and stay focused
Come with a different approaching
Go from a player to coach be
'Cause you go harder than most

[Pre-Chorus]
I did everything that I want (uh)
I still don't really care what anybody else think
Now I can have anything, I ain't gon' stunt
And I don't feel bad 'cause I did it my way
And now they all say

[Chorus]
"It must be nice, it must be nice
To have them Washingtons on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have everybody on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have them Washingtons by your side
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have everybody by your side"

[Intro]
Whoa…
Whoa… Oooh
Oo-oooh

[Verse 1]
Ay
I was younger than you are now
When I was given my first command
I led my men into a massacre
Witnessed their deaths firsthand
Oh, I made every mistake
I felt the shame rise in me
And even now I lie awake
Knowing history, history

[Chorus]
History has its eyes on me
History, history, history
Ah, history has its eyes on me
History, history, history
Ahhh

[Verse 2]
Let me tell you what I wish I’d known
When I was young and dreamed of glory
Don't nobody have control
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story
I know that we can win
I know that greatness lies in you
But remember from here on in
History, history

[Chorus]
History has its eyes on you
History, history, history
Ah, history has its eyes on you
History, history, history

And it makes for walking tough

[Refrain]
Oww! Oww! Oww!

[Verse]
Well I ain’t dumb
But I ain’t that smart
And I can’t spell
But I can sound it out

[Refrain]
Gotta keep your high hopes low, oh!
High hopes low

[Verse]
Well I ain’t dumb
But I ain’t that smart
And I can’t spell
But I can sound it out

[Refrain]
Gotta keep your high hopes low
High hopes low, high hopes low, oh!
High hopes low, yup

[Outro]
Well I ain’t slow
My high hopes' low
My high hopes' low
My high hopes' low
My high hopes' low, oh
High hopes low

[Verse 1]
As a child I felt inclined
To fold my ears in twine
Never once was I confined
I picked and choosed about my ride
So buckle me in before we set sail ahead
For it smells like cabbage
Got way too stale like death

[Bridge]
Oh you’re white as a ghost, I never felt so pale
As the blood dripped across the floor

[Verse 2]
So put it buried in your chest
With the rest of your drunken regrets
Inches from your jugular
As the room fills up in front of ya
It took them long enough
For them to stop and suggest
Hey we better get him some help
We better get him out of here

[Verse 3]
How did I manage to cope as the blood soaked
Through my clothes and to the floor
From outside to the bathroom door
I was inches from my life
Yeah that’s what keeps me up at night
Oh how did I survive, you should'a died
How did I manage to cope being alive
After all it was just a innocent play fight
I hope they don’t stop to sympathise
Oh, stitch up the past to cure their whoremented heart, ah
Oh, tormented dreams it’s all left in between

[Verse]
Push me down, I will not crack
You're just a monkey with your claws in my back
I said it, and you heard
That murky bottle's cutting me some slack

[Chorus]
But it's like all I wanna do
Sink my teeth in you
You already told me to
You said, "It's alright"
Oh, it's like all I wanna do
Sink my teeth in you
You already told me to
You said, "It's alright"

[Verse]
And push me down, I will not crack
You're just a monkey with your claws in my back
I said it, and you heard
That murky bottle's cutting me some slack

[Chorus]
But it's like all I wanna do
Sink my teeth in you
You already told me to
You said, "It's alright"
It's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh

[Intro]
Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum!
Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum, oh!

[Chorus]
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
I called mum!

[Verse]
I bought a funny glob
I put it in my gob
I had anxiety
I couldn't help myself
But call mum, oh!

[Chorus]
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
I called mum!

[Bridge]
Mum mum mum mum mum mum mum mum

[Outro]
Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum!
Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum-mum-mum-mum-mum!

[Verse]
Oh hell, I’m feeling underwater
My head is sinking like a stone
And hell, I’m feeling kinda sick
I don’t know what’s the use in it
And when you’re feeling suicidal
Sometimes you’ve just got to unfold

[Verse]
Oh hell, I’m feeling underwater
My head is sinking like a stone
And hell, I’m feeling like a prick
I don’t know what’s the use in it
And when you’re feeling suicidal
Sometimes you’ve just got to unfold

[Intro]
I gotta know
If you tryna waste my time you can go
See, I told you so
And all my phonies say (Oh!)
My phonies say (Oh!)
And all my phonies say

[Hook]
With you, I played the role of a fool
And now, it's time for the new script
I didn't do it, I can't do it
I can't do

[Verse 1]
Some emotions can't be explained
They are nameless and are rapidly exchanged
Me and you was listed first
Little did I hold you that tight
And I can't take it any whore

[Hook]
With you, I played the role of a fool
And now, it's time for the new script
I didn't do it, I can't do it
I can't do
With you, I played the role of a fool
And now, it's time for the new script
I didn't do it,I can't do it
I can't do

[Bridge]
I won't forget the day she led me astray
A new boy in a page and not a call for days
You're no good at this relationship thing
Are we together, anyway?

[Hook]
With you, I played the role of a fool
And now, it's time for the new script
I didn't do it, I can't do it
I can't do
With you, I played the role of a fool
And now, it's time for the new script
I didn't do it,I can't do it
I can't do

[Bridge]
This is stupid
Me and you split
J-L-E-M, J-L-E-M, J-L-E-M, J-L-E-M

[Hook]
With you, I played the role of a fool
And now, it's time for the new script
I didn't do it, I can't do it
I can't do
With you, I played the role of a fool
And now, it's time for the new script
I didn't do it,I can't do it
I can't do

[Verse 1: Elbee Thrie]
Some record labels think like fart and it's retarded
How they tryna change the artist
Deep into recording they restarted
Like getting back what you asked for
Bad bartend 

[?]
Talented out the ass
We're not subjects to change
Music roll, float dirty like we just gave it AIDS
We just do our thing
I rap when I want to what I want
(I will sing)
Why can't I say what I want?
Because the label's tryna switch it up?
Well guess what? It's not going down
For the same reason J5 left Motown
As free slaves to the label they made epic music
Do your research, for real, they made epic music
Many came next, but with the legs to do it
Rather remain unsigned and change with the times

[Hook]
Keep up with the times
(Or watch as they go)
Unveil your blinded eyes
(Take a chance 'cause you never know)
It's time to realize that
We have our own minds that
Do what they want to do

[Verse 2:]
Back in this time to rap again
It's the young messiah trappin' 'em
Other cats just doing their thing, but I'm more passionate (Yeah)
Fire to a few, a match in some gas
Back when I was doing me
They was want me to do what they askin'
I ain't a sucker, I'm in love with good music
Especially if the fans bump to it
Huh, you think I'm stupid?
Thinking I'm gone sell out and let the fans down
I am original, that got me where I am now
A band now, Phony Ppl, rocking jam 

[?]
Sex education for those who don't understand now
How yet they try to label me explicit?
Not knowing there's a message in my lyrics
Reflection of my feelings
Real life sex and drug-dealin'
Chilling with loose triggers that look so unappealin'
Now tell me what's the difference: Phony or being Phony?
At least you got the chance to f*ckin' know me

[Hook]
Keep up with the times
(Or watch as they go)
Unveil your blinded eyes
(Take a chance 'cause you never know)
It's time to realize that
We have our own minds that
Do what they wanna do

[Verse 3:]
Too sexual for our demographic?
That's like saying that women aren't attractive
And listeners aren't looking at 'em
Hey kids, you wanna know where babies come from? (Where?)
When your mom cums
Nothin' to run from
Like we're supposed to be some political activists
And act as if Vanessa Hudgins doesn't leak nasty pics
Like execs don't promote subliminal interests
And Miley Cyrus doesn't take an incest for big checks (Ew)
Sorry to change your achy-breaky heart (Haha)
But what we're makin' isn't changin' just to make it to the charts and be famous
And have a name that everybody knows
What is knowin' my name if you don't feel us in your soul?
What's the form of expression when there's burdens on my chest
And can't say what I want?
According to the people watching us (Wow)
Shout out: I've got mad respect for Ralph
So for a second, I'll shut my mouth
I'm done

[Hook]
Keep up with the times
(Or watch as they go)
Unveil your blinded eyes
(Take a chance 'cause you never know)
It's time to realize that
We have our own minds that
Do what they wanna do

[Intro: Gucci Mane]

[Chorus: Akon, Chris Brown & Gucci Mane]
Moon walk (huh, huh)

Man, I make that bitch moon walk (ooh)
Sliding up and down that wood (huh)
Shoulda seen that hoe moon walk
Screaming out, "Daddy, you so good" (wow)

Pull up on they block,First  48
Gripping that heat

Trapping and capping getting money all week
Pussy ass nigga, you know that you weak
Pull on yo block, shoot a nigga in his cheek
Came up from serving, you know it's no flocking
I pull up on yo block and I'm gripping the chopper
I'm getting to the money

Man look at yo bitch, she say I'm trending topic
I came up, and you know a nigga got rich
Standing in Zone 1 I'm serving them bricks
Who want beef with me,I'm gripping hollow tips ?
Mac 11 on me make his body flip
Giuseppe karate kick
Hop out the foreign whip , like it's a stolen whip
I'm gripping the .223,came in with hollow tips
Disrespect Soulja,man, we gone shoot some shit
The pistol be popping
Everybody be dropping
In broad day, and I'm Ferragamo when I'm shopping
Disrespect Soulja, you know that my niggas start popping
I smoke with Jamaicans, I hang with the Shallahs
I'm smoking on dope, I feel like a rocket
Fettuccine Alfredo, I'm eating my pasta
Maison Margiela, I'm popping my collar
Faking actor, you deserve a Oscar
I'm feeling like Future, this shit get colossal
Hit a nigga,in the head, with a bottle
Maison Margiela, I hop out the Rarri, I'm popping
Too many hoes,got too many options
Nigga who the fuck, you think that you stopping ?
Aim with the chopper, I know that I got him
Grab the uzi, then a nigga start popping
Hunnid shooters in Atlanta, Hunnid of them Bompton
Mini Mac 11, nigga start bussing
Came up from the bottom, never had nothing
Audemar bust down, gave it to my cousin
City to city, Lil Soulja Boy buzzing
You tried to diss Soulja, but boy you a joke
You lame ass nigga, you know that you broke
I'm balling so hard, like I'm on a coat
My shooters pull up, they hit you with scopes
Tell Trump and Hillary, I didn't vote
In the kitchen, hit the pot with the fork
What the fuck Imma vote for ?
In the trap hit the pot, with my elbow
I iced out my other ear
They need to give Obama 4 more years
I'll kill a nigga, tat one more tear
Broke ass nigga, get the fuck out of here
I'm getting to the money, dope up in the wind
I was gone stop, but now it's time to go in

And I'm Soulja Tell Em' and I whip up a 10
Sipping on juice, I don't do the Gin

Disrepect Soulja, boy you know you dead

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
He love that I say what I feel, he feel what I say 'cause it's real
You couldn't forget, I never changed up on my set
And I only make calls to collect, that's why we connect
We can go half on a jet, baby, we on to the next, fuck all the stress
Fuckin' with bitches who's new to the game when you got you a vet
I know you like it when I act like I'm still shy
Then turn around and put that thing in overdrive, I'm down to ride
I'ma keep you on my shoulder
'Cause every cold nigga need a bae that's ten times colder, no

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani & Post Malone]

Diamonds my state of mind, I'm drownin' in the ocean
Just stay right where you are and don't come any closer
I'm just gon' handle mine and just maintain composure
People, they say learn from mistakes, yeah
You keep your space, yeah, but all this pain, yeah
You say you go away, yeah, stay in my lane, oh
It hurt so bad when you went away, yeah
I needed you, needed you
So what the fuck do I do?

So what the fuck do I do? Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh my god, oh my god
A lot of bullshit on my mind
Oh my god, oh my god

There's a knot up in my throat
And I didn't come here on my own

[Chorus]
Yeah, my wrist so cold and my ice on froze
And it's all for you
Yeah, my ice so cold and my wrist so froze
Yeah it's all for you

[Verse 2]
My jewelry on, like an ice cube
And all I wanna do is just ignite you
This Saint Laurent, mama, you look nice too
Can't hold my tongue, don't got the heart to
Remember when I fell in love?
I just came up, oh lord
Remember aim three? My fault
Told that bad bitch get on my VLONE
Hey, don't have much to do and
Everything is ruined
Ayy, ain't no secret to it

Baby wanna get in this S-Class (S-Class)
Little mama, she just wanna go fast (Go fast)
You know, baby, you don't get a free pass (Free pass)

And told myself that everything's okay (Okay, yeah)
Try to understand how you standin' over me
And girl, it's drivin' me crazy, yeah

[Verse 2: Post Malone & Pharrell Williams]
It's freezin' fuckin' cold in the dead of night
And I'ma drop the top with no Rogaine (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
And now might sound irrelevant
But I prefer to stack my chips when everything fallin' (Backwoods)
And I ain't religious but I look into the sky
And pray to anyone holy (Anyone holy)
I been drinkin' way too much and man I got the blues
Because my baby don't hold me (Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
Take me all the way to the top, baby
Don't even if I tell you to stop, baby
Take me all the way to the sky, baby, baby

Must be better than the hell on the ground
I wanna go up there
And I don't ever wanna come down

Take it off, follow me now, let me in, don't shut me out
Don't tell me you love me if that's not how it really is

[Chorus]
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight, stand and fight for me

[Verse 1]
You don't need to paint me a sweet fantasy
We chill, I kick back, you roll up my weed
Say what you feel, don't just say anything
Why complicate what could be so easy?
Leave me alone
If you is a player, I don't think I'ma play with you, uh-uh
This shit get old
If you wanna lay with her, why don't you just stay with her?

[Pre-Chorus]
You say you don't want a girlfriend but when we are in person
You always act so different, you make it all seem perfect
You hold me when we wake up, say you like me with no makeup
I'm tryin' to be patient, how am I supposed to take it?

[Chorus]
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight for me
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight, stand and fight for me

[Verse 2]
I'm sick of chillin', sippin' on Tecate
That life is a bore, we needed more than drunken Fridays
I'm not dissin' your freedom, I know you like to party
Just don't be that boy who fuck with anything that gyrate
I know you know I'm right, pick up on the vibe
If you read between the lines, bein' shy just ain't my style, now

[Pre-Chorus]
You say you don't want a girlfriend but when we are in person
You always act so different, you make it all seem perfect
You hold me when we wake up, say you like me with no makeup
I'm trying to be patient, how am I supposed to take it?

[Chorus]
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight for me

I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight, stand and fight for me

[Bridge]
If you wanna be the one
Don't act sad and wait
And waste my day
I'm not that way

[Chorus]
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight for me
Is it casual?
Spend your life with me
Pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight, stand and fight for me

In the city, we sinning, we don’t ever want to come down
I never thought that it would hit this hard

[Verse 2]
Me and J take over and we way up
Now high above the city of angels
Smoke a boge in the sky, pass the fuego

Only came to the club 'cause they paid us
Take this shit and lemme see what you made of
No sleep, little mama, we gon' stay up
Vampires on a night in Las Vegas

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, yeah (Ooh, yeah)

In the city, we sinning, we don’t ever want to come down
I never thought that it would hit this hard
I just keep running and running and running around
I never thought that it would hit this hard
The feeling is different instead when you wake on the ground

In the city, we sinning, we don’t ever want to come down
I never thought that it would hit this hard

[Verse 1]
I done drank codeine from a broken whiskey glass
I done popped my pills and I smoked my share of grass
Slaved for the man and I broke my fuckin' back
So you can take your nine-to-five and shove it up your ass
And that 101 is like the highway in hell
Going too damn fast, I spilled drink on my Chanel
And I woke up and my room's fuckin' trashed like a damn hotel
And where I'm goin' next, man, only time will tell

[Refrain]
Woah-oh
Woah-oh
Woah-oh
Woah-oh

[Verse 2]
I done spent some time chasin' women that don't give a shit
I done learned my lessons and I ain't never gon' forget
Started callin' this shit, started ballin' and shit, started flickin' that wrist
They ain't never listened, now I'm makin' them hits, so I'm fuckin' your bitch (Ooh)
No, it ain't that difficult for me to forget that you ever exist
Bet you remember my name when I pull up in that whip that doesn't exist (Skrrt)
Spill lean on Supreme last Saturday
Let that shit splash, motherfucker, talk saucy
Pass me them drugs, motherfucker, let me try 'em
At the White House, call my homie Joe Biden, he flyin' out weed
Smokin' my dope, Bathing Ape, that be the clothes
Man, don't be silly, that shit you rockin' is old
Like it's years since you been to the store
Feel like Meek Milly, but I ain't from Philly
I'm poppin' a wheelie, I show off my grilly
I do this for realy and for my family
Same shit every night, man, it's all so famil'-y
The bitches, they killin' me
Like, bitch, are you kiddin' me?
Ballin', that shit Jason Kidd to me
You can't get rid of me
Yeah, you want my chain and my chi
Bitch, I'm real good at chemistry

[Intro]
I've been looking for someone...
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep it pouring
And I ain't seen the light of day since, well, that's not important, it's been long
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip the Houston
Cars and clothes, thought I was winnin', you knew I was losing
You told me to wake up but my clock always stays on snooze and I'm done

[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowin'
Ain't always broken, but here's to hopin'
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
And I've been looking for someone that I can buy my drugs from
It seems like every plug ran east to Utah, became Mormons
Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on
Sober, ugh
I had eighty beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do then
I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune
And lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
Drank more

[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowin'
Ain't always broken, but here's to hopin'
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Your lips, your eyes, don't wanna let go
Your skin on mine, I'm losing control
Hear the rumble in your chest
Feel the wind comin' off your breath
Your curves ain't slowin' me down
Ain't nothing gonna stop us now

[Chorus]
You're fire, I'm lightning, we're burnin' at the core
Fallin' and crashin', girl, we're a perfect storm
Every time our hearts collide
I can feel our love come to life
It's insane, baby
We're like thunder in the rain

[Verse 2]
Twisted, tangled like a hurricane
We shake these walls like an earthquake
Hear the rumble in your chest
Feel the wind comin' off your breath
The way you're callin' out my name
Makes me hard to contain

[Chorus]
You're fire, I'm lightning, we're burnin' at the core
Fallin' and crashin', girl, we're a perfect storm
Every time our hearts collide
I can feel our love come to life
It's insane, baby
We're like thunder in the rain
We're like thunder in the rain

[Bridge]
You're fire, I'm lightning, we're burnin' at the core
Fallin' and crashin', girl, we're a perfect storm

[Chorus]
You're fire, I'm lightning, we're burnin' at the core
Fallin' and crashin', girl, we're a perfect storm
Every time our hearts collide
I can feel our love come to life
It's insane, baby
We're like thunder in the rain
We're like thunder in the rain

[Pre-hook]
I was, down
But I'm really lit right now
A couple drinks in your head
Your calling me daddy instead
Mommy how that dress fit tight
Is it heaven between your thighs
She wanna know what's my name
Lil mama look you can call me

[Hook]
Baba
Baby you can call me Baba
Baby you can call me Baba
Not your daddy, or your father, or your papa
Baba
Baby you can call me Baba
Baby you can call me Baba
African so I can hit it proper

[Verse 1]
My stroke game good, check this
He buy you nice things girl that's reckless
I'd rather give ya my password to Netflix
Look
I know I'm a black boy, brown skin
White girl think I taste like chocolate
Hm, maybe you should come try a lick, shit
Badder then average
Shawty's a savage
Face from the heavens with a ass on Dallas
And her first name lavish
Material girl like Gucci and Prada
I used to rock Fubu and Dada
Two different types of people
But I know we equal
If you give me one chance I don't need a sequel
Singin'
Your body's like a temple to me
If feels like tetherball's in the sky
Soaring free from the worlds fallacies
One hit is all you need to fly

[Pre-Hook]
I was, down
But I'm really lit right now
A couple drinks in your head
Your calling me daddy instead
Mommy how that dress fit tight
Is it heaven between your thighs
She wanna know what's my name
Lil mama look you can call me

[Hook]
Baba
Baby you can call me Baba
Baby you can call me Baba
Not your daddy, or your father, or your papa
Baba
Baby you can call me Baba
Baby you can call me Baba
African so I can hit it proper

[Verse 2]
I reside in the 503, it's the west side nigga
Shawty say she only date dude with whips, when she ride the bus, how that make sense?
I try to give you everything
Gold diggers we no wife'm we no give them wedding rings like
I wanna know you
You wanna know me
We busy as fuck so we in and we out
No time for us now
Material girl like Gucci and Prada
I used to rock Fubu and Dada
Two different types of people
But I know we equal
If you give me one chance I don't need a sequel
Singin'
Your body's like a temple to me
If feels like tetherball's in the sky
Soaring free from the worlds fallacies
One hit is all you need to fly

Note: "MAN 1," "MAN 2," and others are not continuous characters between scenes.

[Dialogue begins, all in voiceover]

MAN 1: So my buddy, who was on the job, laughs, true story, he got a call over, or whatever. There's some kid hanging out, they're smoking pot. So he smells and goes, "what're you doing?"

MAN 2: (indistinctly) Yeah.

MAN 1: (imitating kid)"Nothing, nothing."

And he's like, "Dude, just like, why you smoking in the hallway? Someone's gonna call us, and you're playing music, you're just doing stupid shit, right?"

So he tells his partner, "just wait right here, I wanna check something."

So he goes behind and he finds the bag. He puts his gun there. So he goes, "alright, bring the kid down."

"So, uh, am I going to find anything?"

Kid says, "you know, nah, you're not going to find anything."

"You're sure I'm not going to find anything."
(imitating kid)"No, you're not going to find anything, Officer."

He's being a wise-ass. So he goes behind the plant and he goes, ha, "Oh, you got pot here? exaggeratedOh, my, and your little fucking weapon?"

(imitating kid, panicking)"No, no, that's not mine, Officer, that's not mine!"

He goes, "Holy shit, we gotta call this in, you're going away for a long time." Kid starts freaking out.

MAN 2: (over MAN 1, laughing, indistinct) He's shitting his pants.

MAN 1: Oh, and he's shitting his pants. At this point he's like crying, he's not such a tough guy now.

"You sure this is not yours?"

(imitating kid, panicking)"Oh my god, it's not mine!"

"Oh, I guess it's mine." Puts it back in his holster, takes the bag apart -

MAN 2: (laughing) Probably used it.

MAN 1: Oh, no, he definitely did. He told me. He's like, "I took it. No big deal."

MAN 2: (chuckles) That's awesome.

MAN 1: You know why I tell you this story? You know why?
MAN 2: Why?

MAN 1: Because you have to have a little fun sometimes.

[Scene cuts to WOMAN 2 walking on street and hitchhiking; WOMAN 2 gets in car]

[Verse 1]
If you had only gotten to me first
If I could write a book on how this hurts
If you could see the way your smile looks to me
If I wasn't scared of the world alone
If I didn't know he loves me so
If I could only find the strength to leave
You'd be with me, so baby

[Chorus]
Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me

[Verse 2]
It's so wrong that all I wanna do
Is forget it all and just be with you
I have to go 'cause he don't know
But the writing's on the wall
But here we are in so deep, soaking wet
Jumping in without no safety net
And I don't know what kinda ropes
Would break this kinda fall, so baby

[Chorus]
Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go, I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait, wait for me

[Bridge]
We can't be together right now
Guess there's no use in trying
But if you look at me right now
Can you tell that I'm dying
To hold you
But it would be wrong to

[Chorus]
So don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me

[Outro]
Don't you look now
Don't you look now
I might fall in love
Don't you look now

[Verse 1]
Stowed away in my heart
Holding hands with the part
We were meant to be the stars
Broken hands from the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
We dreamed too far
We dreamed too far

[Chorus]
Band aids in a box
Band aids in a box
Reach for
Band aids in a box
Band aids in a box

[Verse 2]
And now you're here in my face
It's been done; too late
We are the ones to tempt fate
We are the ones to ease the pain

[Pre-Chorus]
We dreamed too far
We dreamed too far

[Chorus]
Band aids in a box
Band aids in a box
Reach for
Band aids in a box
Band aids in a box (2x)

[Verse 1: Young M.A.]
Growing up I had a little sister, older brother
And for us a father figure was a single mother
My daddy was locked up, my mother was knocked up
And every now and then my brother's father would pop up
But I considered him dad
Because he would give me basically anything that I asked
Fresh kicks for the summer, I would crease 'em and scuff 'em
Goose coat for the winter with a new pair of butters (Ooouuu)
He treated me like I was his
A single mother, no daddy, that's just how we lived
We didn't understand cuz we was just kids
A blended family, at times that's just what it is
That's just what it is

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
Hey I might not really be your mother
That don't mean that I don't really love ya
And even though I married your father
That's not the only reason I'm here for ya

[Pre-Hook: Alicia Keys]
I think you're beautiful
I think you're perfect
I know how hard it gets
But I swear it's worth it, worth it

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love
'cause there ain't nothing, there ain't nothing, there ain't nothing
There ain't nothing I won't do for us
It may not be easy
This blended family, but baby
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love, love

[Verse 3: Alicia Keys]
I know it started with a little drama
I hate you had to read it in the paper
But everything's alright with me and ya Mama
Baby everybody here you know adores ya

[Pre-Hook: Alicia Keys]
I think it's beautiful
I think its perfect
I know how hard it gets
But I swear it's worth it, worth it

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love
'cause there ain't nothing, there ain't nothing, there ain't nothing
There ain't nothing I won't do for us
It may not be easy
This blended family, but baby
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love, love

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
For love, for love
Are you this real my true love
Cause you're my baby, rejoice daily
I believe love could bring us closer than blood

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love
There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing, there ain't nothing
There ain't nothing I won't do for us
It may not be easy
This blended family but baby
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love

[Outro: Alicia Keys]
That's just what you do (for love)
For love of the babies (for love)
We're a blended family (for love)
And it's alright (for love)
Said it's alright!
I'll be here forever

[Intro]
This next song I'm about to do for y'all
Is a song that it means a lot to me

[Verse 1]
I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left?

[Pre-Chorus]
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

[Chorus]
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?

[Verse 2]
I don't need your honesty, it's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that mattered
Tell me, who do I run to?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

[Chorus]
If this is my last night with you
You better hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?

[Bridge]
Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask, all I ask is...

[Chorus]
If this is my last night with you
You better hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love, never love
Never love, never love again?

[Outro]
We love you Adele
We love you BBC
Go pre-order the album right now
It's called '24k Magic'
I'm Bruno Mars
These are the Hooligans
Good night
Who wants that perfect love story any way, anyway
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
Who wants that hero love that saves the day, anyway
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
What about the bad guy goes good, yeah
An innocent love un-misunderstood, yeah
Black hour glass, hour glass
Toast to cliché is in a dark past
Toast to cliché is in a dark past

I don't care if we on the run
Baby, long as I'm next to you
And if loving you is a crime
Tell me why do I bring out
The best in you

I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, no
I know it's crazy but
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you take me
Without you I got nothing to lose

Who wants that perfect love story any way, anyway
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
Who wants that hero love that saves the day, anyway
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
What about the bad guy goes good, yeah
An innocent love un-misunderstood, yeah
Black hour glass, hour glass
Toast to cliché is in a dark past
Toast to cliché is in a dark past

I don't care if they give me life
I get all of my life from you
And if loving you had a price
I would pay my life for you

I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, no
I know it's crazy but
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you take me
Without you I got nothing to lose

I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
Without you I got nothing to lose

[Verse 1]
Up in the rainbow, teepee sky
No one's looking down on you or I
That's just a mirror in your eye
Ain't taken my last hit yet
I know that things are different now
(I see the same old signs
But something new is growing)
Don't think I'll cash it in yet
Don't think I'll put down my last bet
(I'm gonna keep my hand in
Because something new is growing)

[Chorus]
Think I'll hit the Peace Trail
Take a trip back home to my old town
'Cause everyone back there says
Something new is growing

[Verse 2]
Up in the rainbow, teepee sky
No one's looking down on you or I
It's just a mirror in our eye
If I believe in someone
I have to believe in myself
(I have to take good care
When something new is growing)
The world is full of changes
Sometimes all these changes make me sad
(But I keep planting seeds
'Til something new is growing)

[Chorus]
I think I'll hit the Peace Trail
I know that treasure takes its time
(I have to take good care
When something new is growing)
I think I'll hit the Peace Trail
I think I like my chances now
(I have to take good care
When something new is growing)
I think I'll hit the Peace Trail
I think I'll hit the Peace Trail now
Because something new is growing

[Verse 1]
There's a battle raging on the sacred land
Our brothers and sisters had to take a stand
Against us now for what we all been doing
On the sacred land there's a battle brewing

[Chorus]
I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news

[Verse 2]
Now it's been about 500 years
We keep taking what we gave away
Just like what we call Indian givers
It makes you sick and gives you shivers

[Chorus]
I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news

[Verse 3]
Big money going backwards and ripping the soil
Where graves are scattered and blood was boiled
When all who look can see the truth
But they just move on and keep their groove

[Chorus]
I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news

[Verse 4]
Saw Happy locked to the big machine
They had to cut him loose and you know what that means
That's when Happy went to jail
Behind big money justice always fails

[Chorus]
I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news

[Verse 5]
Bring back the days when good was good
Lose these imposters in our neighborhood
Across our farms and through our waters
All at the cost of our sons and squaw daughters
Yeah our brave sons and daughters
We're all here together fighting poison waters
Standing against the evil way
That's what we have at the end of day

[Chorus]
I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news
I am Donald Trump's private pilot
And I fly him everywhere
Taxi him to his outdoor rallies
Where he gives you all a scare

I've set up a fund for my children
And you can donate online
'Cause when I'm gone
They should be protected
No, blaming them would be over the line

For when we take off for Cleveland
And clear that tri-state sprawl
I will find a field and I will take her down
Screaming, "Justice for you all
Oh, justice for you all
Justice for you all"

[Kanye West]

Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid
Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived, cuz
It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe does
He write his own rhymes, so sort of
I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than u ever thought up
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder
So its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
- its for yourself that's important
If a stripper named Porscha and u get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

[Kanye West]

I was sick about awards
Couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them
What more can you ask for?
The international assholes nah
Who complains about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
Its Kanye - But some of my plastic - they still say Kane
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
My father Ben said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you can call you gotta best believe it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like "pssh we messed up"
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog "Yo, where Dame at?"
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
"What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?"
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-r-right here stands a-man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands...
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?...

[Biggie]

I was a terror since the public school era
Bathroom passes, cuttin classes, squeezing asses
Smoking blunts was a daily routine
Since thirteen, a chubby nigga on the scene
I used to have the tre` duce
And the duce duce in my bubblegoose
Now i got the mack in my knapsack
Loungin' black, smoking sacks up in acts
And sidekicks with my sidekicks rockin fly kicks
Honeys want to chat
But all we wanna know is "Where the party at?"
And can i bring my gat?
If not, I hope I don't get shot
But i throw my vest on my chest
'Cause niggas is a mess
It don't take nothin' but frontin'
For me to start somethin'
Buggin' and barkin' at niggas like i was duck huntin'
Dumbing out, just me and my crew
Cause all we wanna do is...
Chorus:
Party... And bullshit, and... (x9)

[Biggie]

Hugs from the honeys, Pounds from the roughnecks
Seen my man Sei that I knew from the projects
Said he had beef, asked me if I had my peice
Sure do, two .22's in my shoes
Holler if you need me love i'm in the house
Roam and strollin' see what the honeys is about
Moet popping, hoe hopping, ain't no stopping Big Poppa, I'm a BAD BOY
Niggas wanna front, who got your back?
Niggas wanna flex, who got the gat?
It ain't hard to tell I'm the east coast overdoser
Nigga you scared you're supposed to
Nigga I toast ya, put fear in your heart
Fuck up the party before it even start
Pissy drunk, off the Henny and stuff
Or some brand-nubian shit beatin' down punks!

Chorus (x9)

[Biggie]

Bitches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress, i think i might just
Hit her with a little Biggie 101, How to tote a gun
And have fun with Jamaician rum
Conversations, blunts in rotation
My man Big Jacques got the Glock in his waist and
We're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking
If money smell bad than this nigga Biggie stinking
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin out my palm
She grabbed my arm and said "Let's leave calm"
I'm hittin' skins again
Rolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken
Niggas start to look out, a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out

[Music stops, indecipherable sounds of people yelling and arguing
Biggie breaks it up yelling "Yo chill, man, chill!"]

[Biggie]

Can't we just all get along?
So i can put hickies on her chest like Li'l Shawn
Get her pissy drunk off of Don Perrignon
And it's on, and I'm gone
That's that

[Chorus w/ Puff Daddy talking after selected lines]

Party... and Bullshit
And Party... and Bullshit
And Party... and Bullshit
And Party... and Bullshit
And Party... and Bullshit
And Party... and Bullshit
And Party... and Bullshit
And Party... and Bullshit
And Party... and Bullshit
And Party... and Bullshit
And Party... and Bullshit
And Party... and Bullshit
And Party... and Bullshit
And Party... and Bullshit
Repeats until fade out

[Intro: Verse Simmonds]
You know what time it is
Legendary
And I brought some of my friends with me
Like they here, here go, huh

I just wanna come through, do you got friends?
I ain't tryna press you, do you got plans?
Room 112 at the Four Seasons
Left the key downstairs, get it on your way in
She said, "I ain't got no panties on"
You know how many we meet with no panties on?

[Pre-Chorus: Verse Simmonds, with Ty Dolla $ign]
And that night I'm going through the same thing
She know I ain't looking for a main thing
And she gon' do whatever for a real one

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
You smell that girl perfume on my pillow
I said, "Don't worry 'bout it", ain't got nothing to do with us
I knew as soon I hit it more than once
I gave you the wrong impression, still haven't learnt my lesson
That love is gooder as a motherfucker, girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl, I got you sprung and I'm up, aw yeah
Yeah, yeah, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Verse Simmonds]

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Tonight, tonight (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
You see my phone ringing when I'm asleep
You know it's them other girls, that come around you all the time
And you can't believe that it's your best friend
And you say, "How could you cheat with them hoes?" Woah
I should have been, told her, I had a couple of her friends over
We started drinking, I wish I would have stayed sober
We started dancing, they started pulling
Straight to the bed, then we started fucking, hey

[Pre-Chorus: Verse Simmonds with Ty Dolla $ign & Chris Brown]
And that night I'm going through the same thing (Same thing)
She know I ain't looking for a main thing (Ooh, oh, oh)
And she gon' do whatever for a real one (Real one)

[Chorus]
Too many killers

And we can have you time, we can have your fly for a race

Up and down, up and up and up and down, so you ride it
Baby, you need to celebrate

Too many killers in my basement
Too many killers

Hold up, wait a minute

[Verse 1]
You listening, witnessing
History in the making
I'm taking everything over
I've been patiently waiting
I'm hot as that boy they call Satan
Jehovah's my witness man
Contradicting, ain't it?
Buddy, that's the business man
Fuck rap, you listening to a business man
I'm making sure my kids enjoy Christmas man
I'm learning Corporate schemes
While y'all out chasing street dreams
I'm making clean man dawg
Fuck a triple-beam

[Bridge]
Hey DJ Ideal, do me a favor
You know what time it is
Bring that mother-fucking shit back!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You listening, witnessing
History in the making
I'm taking everything over
I've been patiently waiting
I'm hot as that boy they call Satan
Jehovah's my witness man
Contradicting, ain't it?
Buddy, that's the business man
Fuck rap, you listening to a business man
I'm making sure my kids enjoy Christmas man
I'm learning Corporate schemes
While y'all out chasing street dreams
I'm making clean man dawg
Fuck a triple-beam
I know blocks

In one week than your town in one year
Think not (Woooo!)
But I'm done with that
Instead of cooking crack, I'm cooking rap
And its raw, that's why DJ's bring it back

[Outro]
Hold up wait a minute

[Intro: Paul Wall **Pitbull**]
Bitch, we going down
Paul Wall, the people's champ
Out in Stores
**That's that little chico Pitbull**
**It's the bottom mate**
Between what they talk right
**DJ Ideal!**
DJ Ideal, what they do

[Hook: Pitbull]
I'm running laps on these boys
I don't even gotta pull gats on these boys
These boys like 7-Eleven
They don't mean crap to this boy
24/7, my money stack on these boys
I'm coming from the bottom
Harold-smacking these boys

I'm running laps on these boys
I don't even gotta pull gats on these boys
These boys like 7-Eleven
They don't mean crap to this boy
24/7, my money stack on these boys
I'm coming from the bottom
Harold-smacking these boys

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Growing up I had my fair share of family problems
Now I'm grown, touch my family if you want a problem
I'm a die hard fan of, making money
Now my money makes me money, now I'm making money
Everyday I thank god that I'm making money
Is your friend a foe, will you ride or rode
This is the life I chose, no longer selling oz
El Mariel, with God's help boy, it will blow
I've attained, the unattainable
Done, the unimaginable
It's unbelievable like B.I.G when he died a passenger
I think B.I.G ride with God as a passenger
Keep hating while I'm passing ya

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Paull Wall]
It's Paul Wall from the Swisha House beat
I've only been grinding and hustling, since I was six
Remember back in the days, I used to drink tabs
Now I buying at the bar, baby put it on my tab
I'm a national prospect, like my boy Brandy Washington
I'm sipping on that bar, so you never see me coughing
I've never had a cavity, you know I stay flossing
And Imma keep hustling 'til they put me in the coffin
I got some good advice from box and papa Joe
If I swallow all my pride then my bliss is to blow
I shoot a kite to my dawg Roger
Locked up in the form, he doing 45
Hey, got him tatted on my arm
Catch me at the sky bar, posted low key
Reminiscing 'bout the old school with my OG's
If you waiting for me to fly, the JTRL
I can buy my sound skins, so you know Imma sell
I got an album called the People's Champ, In stores now
I got them diamonds in my mouth, baby bling bling bow
It's Paul Wall baby, representing Swisha House
Y'all already know, umm, it's going down

[Hook]

[Outro: Paul Wall & Pitbull]
(Paul Wall)
Hey, if you trying to get a grill in your mouth
Fuck with this TV jewelry
832-661-5664
832-661-5664 baby
Where they do all that custom jewelry
Top quality diamonds
You know what I'm talking bout
I let my boy TV done it
Paul Wall, the people's champ baby

(Pitbull)
Lassarito, I appreciate the love
Khaled, I appreciate the love
Ideal always, true what they do
Mike Calderon come pinga, que bola
Juan filipi come mierda, que bola
Julio mamatranca, que bola
Look out for El Mariel coming out
Spanish Album behind it coming out
Called Armando, so ya tu sabe
Preparase porque la cosa va esta fea
Dale joputa que bola con Pit

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 1: Pitbull]

No spinners, go getta, gorilla, turn killa
Fo scrilla, fo real-a, and I see no nigga
Bet that, get it back, I'm going hard for these stacks
I'm running through these blocks like a runningback
Run it back, while collar, blue collar
Crime dawg I'm done with that
I wish Uncle Al, B.I.G, and Pac bring us back
Cook coke chopped crack ain't longer stop that
Rep your shit, lemme see exactly where you blocks at
Where the mat, where them choppers

You name it, you need it, you want it, we got that
If the money's right, then that white, you can pop that
Witnessing the birth, go ahead draw the tie back

By yours truly, I spit it for these spics and hoodlums
The game is mine, now give it to me, home invasion

[Hook 2: Pitbull]

[Interlude: Bun B]
Yea that's right, this one here for my nigga Pitbull

Go ahead and take over
Show them how its done

[Outro: DJ Ideal]
The bottom bitch!
And I remember when I met him, it was so clear that
he was the only one for me.
We both knew it, right away.
And as the years went on, things got more difficult --
we were faced with more challenges.
I begged him to stay. Try to remember what
we had at the beginning. He was charismatic, magnetic,
electric and everybody knew it. When he walked in
every woman's head turned, everyone stood up
to talk to him. He was like this hybrid, this mix of
a man who couldn't contain himself.
I always got the sense that he became torn
between being a good person and
missing out on all of the opportunities that life could
offer a man as magnificent as him.
And in that way I understood him
and I loved him.
I loved him, I loved him, I loved him.
And I still love him.
I love him.

[Verse 1]
Eyes are closed
I don't know
What her moving eyelids see
Deep inside so privately
(Like you do)

[Verse 2]
Light is low
So it won't
Pull her out from underneath
See me sitting patiently
(Like I do)

[Verse 3]
Move a bit
Light afflicts
Placid floating on a cloud
Turn the TV volume down
(Like I do)

[Verse 4]
Bends her knees
And she speaks
(No, no, no. Your hands are too cold)
Coming up on half past three
Almost see her look at me
(Like you do)

[Verse 1]
Roll this, slip my shoes on and step outside
Roll my hands up into my sleeves
Reaching back and closing the door behind
Lift it up and pull it with ease
Trying to take a moment outside my screen
Trying to keep down out of the cloud
I can hear the traffic blow on the breeze
I can't figure anything out
(

[Wha's up?])

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
I pinch it for later on
Easy knowing when it's enough
I don't need anxiety, move along
This is gonna make it too much
Trying to pull together to keep this up
Trying to stack a couple more pills
I can hear the water pouring in my cup
I can do whatever I feel
(Whatever)

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Wait a minute let me try and screw my head back on
Could have sworn it's been a minute now that I've been gone
Everybody's tossing bottles; making quite a scene
Yeah, I guess it's okay if you want to talk with me

[Chorus]
How it could have been, doesn't matter now
What you would have seen, wasn't anyhow
It turned out in the end
And you wanted to be friends
But it doesn't matter what you do
Because I love her
Not you
Not you
Not you
Not you

[Verse 2]
Staring daggers like you think that it could change a thing
Like you hate it, like her being here drives you insane
Maybe you should take a walk and figure what to do
Hope that this'll be the last time that I hear from you

[Chorus]
How it could have been, doesn't matter now
What you would have seen, wasn't anyhow
It turned out in the end
And you wanted to stay friends
But it doesn't matter what you do
Because I love her
Not you

[Intro]
(Hey, are you even paying attention to me right now?)

[Verse 1]
Every single thing that I shouldn't do
Seems to come so natural
I don't know 'bout you

Feeling so out of touch
Staying inside too much
Introducing all these hands but I'm out of luck

[Chorus]
Thought it'd be easier
For me to think of her
I was dreaming as you spoke and not listenin' to you

Thought it'd be easier
For me to think of her
I was dreaming as you spoke and not listenin' to you

[Verse 2]
Is there anything you need?
Make you feel more comfortable
Put your mind at ease

So what do I do instead?
While I think about every single thing
Running through my head
Keeping me inside

[Chorus]
Thought it'd be easier
For me to think of her
I was dreaming as you spoke and not listenin' to you

Thought it'd be easier
For me to think of her
I was dreaming as you spoke and not listenin' to

[Outro]
Every single thing
Every single thing
Every single thing
Every single thing
Every single thing
Every single thing
Every single thing
Every single thing

[Verse 1]
Kind of feeling that I can't ignore
Do my best to try to smoke it off
That's for sure
Only thing that's helping anymore
Only do it when I'm feeling warm

And I don't know if this is coming back
So I roll up, sip it, and I feel alright
I ain't looking for some company
Yeah, the bitch is hurting me
Please don't take it personally

[Chorus]
Wrapping up my leaves
I'm a little out of ease

[?]
And I'll have to smoke tomorrow we will see

[Verse 2]
Walking, feeling so above it all
I'm so high you got a problem, ma?
Cool it off
Take my medicine, I'm coming down
Gunna be an extra gentle now
And I know everyone is coming back
So I roll up, sip it, and I feel alright
People make me feel uncomfortably
And it's only hurting me
Live it up so easily

[Chorus]
Wrapping up my leaves
I'm a little out of ease

[?]
And I better take another day
Wrapping up my leaves
I'm a little out of ease

[?]
And I'll have to smoke tomorrow we'll see

[Verse 1]
Open up my phone
A voice I haven't heard in a little while
It sounds like something's wrong
What can I do?
I'd do anything
It seems so cruel
Maybe you would be better off

[Verse 2]
In a couple weeks I might be seeing him
Break his fucking cheeks
And ask him how he'd cheat
Someone like you
You gave everything
What can I do
Just to ease the pain
Of my babe

[Verse 1]
Drag your feet across the floor
Feeling so relieved
Turning up the thermostat to get a little heat
I could make a cup of coffee
I could make a cup of tea
If I feel like it

[Verse 2]
Plants are looking thirsty
Better have a little drink
Mind's a little foggy better clear it up today
Sipping, staring at a pile of dishes
Lying in the sink
Where I live at

[Chorus]
Everything I think about is timing
Where it isn't what I do
Don't think I can handle this silence
Nothing here, oh what's the use
Feeling pretty dry in my eyelids
She'll be heading home in an hour or two

[Verse 3]
Beating up the pillows
Getting ready for the day
Tidy up a little
Put some water on my face
And it's past 11:30 and I know what I could say
When she gets here

[Bridge]
Hold on, baby what did you say?
Looking so good
Please save me
Tell me, tell me
Honey you could feel good

[Chorus]
Everything I think about is timing
Where it isn't what I do
Don't think I can handle this silence
Nothing here, oh what's the use
Feeling pretty dry in my eyelids
She'll be heading home in an hour or two

[Verse 1]
You know he's serious
About the way he feels
So he's gonna take a few of those pills
To get serious
About the way he moves
He's been dreaming 'bout it for a while
Waiting to get down in his

[Chorus]
Room
Trying to get loose
Life has no use
Mixing his juice

[Verse 2]
And he's serious
About the way he looks
But he hasn't got the money that he should
To be serious
About the cash he needs
To get high and buy a couple things
That'll make his shallow heart

[Chorus]
Heal
Swear he'll pop those
People he knows
Trying to make dough

[Bridge]
I know it's easier
Just to pack it up, pretend it ain't you
Don't I know it too?

[Verse 3]
You know he's serious
About the way he feels
So he's gonna take a few of those pills
To be serious
About the way he moves
Things that he might do if he had the hand of a loving, good

[Chorus]
Man
Move it, don't stand
Do what you can
To get it all

[Bridge]
I know what's easier
Just to pack it up, pretend it ain't you
Don't I know it too?

[Verse 1]
So she's doing something I wouldn't do
Trying to be a better person, I guess
Doesn't like how it's been working out
Sick of asking people nicely
(Getting pretty dicey)

[Verse 2]
Been a while, yeah she's been talking about
Didn't matter something I can't believe
Won't be long till she'll be carrying
She'll be her, I'll be me, we'll be alone

[Chorus]
So she says things she shouldn't say
'Bout some people she don't know in another place
Maybe it's the band, maybe TV
Maybe there's a little part of her dying to leave
Guess I'll give her space and let her be
Something I thought that her with I might never agree
If she wants maybe she'll gimme a call
Gotta leave it out or there'll be
Nothing to say at all

[Verse 3]
So she said, "Hey," I said, "Hey, what's up?"
How's it going? Oh, you know, pretty good
Trying to stay busy and get it right
Couple things I didn't mention
(Smoke release the tension)
I can feel the space between every word
And I bet you that she's feeling the same
Okay, well, I guess I'll be seeing you
Wishing we were speaking freely again

[Chorus]
So she says things she shouldn't say
'Bout some people she don't know in another place
Maybe it's the band, maybe T.V
Maybe there's a little part of her dying to leave
Guess I'll give her space and let it be
Something I thought that her with I might never agree
If she wants maybe she'll gimme a call
Gotta leave it out or there'll be nothing to say at all

[Verse 1]
Come and sit and stay a while
You can relax, it's me
Laying out and sipping chamomile
So slow, waiting patiently
Trying to spend the day away
But everything comes up dry
I'm here so I can get it straight
So moved and I wonder why

[Chorus]
'Cause love is a very real thing
A thing that I never could lose
I don't wanna feel this pain
So why you gonna live this way?
Live this way?

'Cause love is a very real thing
A thing that I never could lose
I don't wanna feel this pain
So why you gonna live this way?

[Verse 2]
What you wanna talk about?
Shadow a point you make
Let it in so I can let it out
So old, feeling out of shape
Use a couple of minds
Got it into my hand
Found the switch to get a little light
So bright I could get a tan

[Chorus]
'Cause love is a very real thing
A thing that I never could lose
I don't wanna feel this pain
So why you gonna live this way?
Live this way?

'Cause love is a very real thing
A thing that I never could lose
I don't wanna feel this pain
So why you gonna live this way?
Live this way?

[Bridge]
I can feel your energy
Empty out my memory
Sun doesn't clear my eyes
Maybe you'd be better off
Crashing every 

[?]
Starting

[Verse 3]
Come and sit and stay a while
You can relax, it's me
Feeling slippers on the frozen tile
So cold, living comfortably
Trying to spend a pretty time
Tuning it out with you
Take a breath to empty out my mind
I'm here, what you wanna do?

[Chorus]
'Cause love is a very real thing
A thing that I never could lose
I don't wanna feel this pain
So why you gonna live this way?
Live this way?

Love is a very real thing
A thing that I never could lose
I don't wanna feel this pain
So why you gonna live this way?
Live this way?

[Bridge]
I can feel your energy
Empty out my memory
Sun doesn't clear my eyes
Maybe you'd be better off
Crashing every

Starting

Painting pictures with my mind
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life
Ooh

Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I've changed my mind
There is no simple life for me
I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feeling

I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And it's teasing me
So scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can start to begin what's begun

Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories

Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can finish what I have begun

Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories

Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories

[Verse 1]
Park your whip leave the trash on the side
Cause once entering these gates youll never be alive
Again, again please proceed to the right
You must be excited, the worlds best surprise
And soon to be captured by your eyes
And no capturing, leave your cameras behind
The only thing you need is your body and you mind
You can drive to the entrance but I prefer to fly

[Verse 2]
Grab your ticket and get in the line
You got pees follow me
And heres a map to the rides
Im colorblind when it comes to the night
But for now take this locating device
Eye for an eye get ready for the time, of your life
Its gonna be mighty nice
Im instructor outta luck-tor and dont ask why
I almost forgot, man goodbye

[Interlude]
Id like to welcome you, all of you, to Tygas world. Where there is lots of things to do, and people to see. You might see a flying dachshund or you might see popcorn. Rot. Just playin. Enjoy your stay, boys and girls, at Tygas World!

[Verse 3]
You like what you see so far, right?
Awesome
Characters, Merry-Go-Rounds, jaws droppin
Mind boggling
Kids jogging, Magic Carpets
Many choices, but not a option
Here you will spend the rest of your life
Im Just Joking
Just Kidding, this will be home to many
For many centuries
Check out the goldfishes
Theyre all dead, but still swimmin

[Verse 4]
Oh You think youre so fearless?
Ill take you on another venture
So Im more scarier than your dentist
Its called Grimace
A purple like substance used for licking spirits
Some can say it also chose the heron
Explosion fire off into nighttime
Getting closer
And I think were getting closer
I didn't notice
Im losin focus
Blood loosin
Blurry Motion
Im movin
Oh shit

[Interlude]
Now now now calm down calm down, We can't have any accidents in the park here. But uhm I hope youre having a good time, cause I no I am. But uhm we haven't even gotten to the main attraction yet, boys and girls. Read your map, and welcome. To Tygas World!

[Verse 5]
You scream! You scream!
Youre making up a scene
You won't feel nothing
Pretend its just a dream
Dream that youre safe and sound to sleep
Cause this needle here is gonna put you to sleep
And Im not being funny
Im just following the money
Boss man says Im just working for him
Youre soon gonna meet him
Just dont be afraid as his facial features look like a pizza
Freddy Krueger, the movie, have you seen it?
Well this is sorta the same the doctor dreamin
And might try escaping
You wouldve got away if it wasn't for this nine inch tazer
The torture isnt over
Theres more
More !
More!
And more
Now give me your soul
And enjoy your stay at Tygas World!

[Outro]
Haha I wanna thank you for leaving your soul tonight
And um you guys have been a great audience and I have been a great host
My name is Tyga, man. Well Tyga Alien
Haha and um I wanna thank you boys and girls once again
Come back, To Tygas World

[Verse 1]
Global grief hangs heavy as summer heat
Drenched in rage and crying for relief

[Chorus]
And I-I-I'm sweating
I am sweating

[Verse 2]
And all the times that I ignored my scream
A defensive action that preserves my humanity

[Chorus]
But still, still, I'm sweating
I am sweating

[Verse 3]
And I can't cry another lullaby for a baby that's watched its father die
Oh and I can't sigh another angry sigh for an insecure man that's telling lies
Oh and I can't change the mind of a lonely guy who won't let my friend go rightfully inside

[Chorus]
I'm sweating
I am sweating
I am sweating
I'm sweating

[Intro: Lil Jon]
Hey! Let's go!

[Hook: Lil Jon]
Snap ya fingers! Do ya step!

Let me see you do it! Ay!
Snap ya fingers! Do ya step!
You can do it all by yo self!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Let me see you do it! Ay!

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'm that little chico from the bottom
Will everybody say I'm mister, mister 305
That's what they holla
Who got Miami off the, off the, the, chain, chain
Pitbull, that's who, that's right, that's me
And don't you ever forget
I'm that little chico that take it to the grave
Take it from the M.I.A to A-Town
Without braking down, down, down
I'm talking keys, talking pounds
But that's not my life now
Funny thing, half of these boys that rap
Don't know coke, don't know crack
Down know this, don't know that
They just make me laugh, laugh, laugh
I don't know 'bout them but me
I'm bout my cash, cash, cash
And it make my dick harder
Watching my money stack
I don't gamble, no C-Lo, no craps
Them boys from the A
They like damn, he can snap now
Spray from side to side
And make a

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sean Paul]
Chillin' in the bip, yeah we get crunk
Niggas poppin' bottles and these bitches gettin' drunk
Rollin' up the kush, put it in the air

Brand new shoes, brand new tool
Pull out the ol school, cause I'm feelin' real cool
Yeah I'm from the 'A', so I'm leanin' and rockin'
Snappin' my fingers, then reachin' for my Glock BITCH!
Reppin' my block BITCH!, straight from the deck
When you snap ya fingers shawty, gotta jerk ya neck
Smokin' on the best, we don't fuck wit dat mess
I bet you can't do it, do it, do it like this
Yeah I'm back to the track, back to the snap

This is how we do it in the A town
(and if you ain't know) this how it go down

[Hook]

[Verse 3: E-40]
Straight from da bay, posted in the 'A'
Bout to hit the club, we been mobbin' all day
Drinkin' on some Rossi, dyin' off Patron
VIP style, strapped wit my chrome
Look around the club, what do I see
Everybody rockin' from side to side to the beat
Snappin' they fingers, bouncin' to the groove
All by they self, that's the new move
Nigga where I'm from, we like to go dumb
I'm soakin' up the game, I'm seein' how its done
I ask shawty what they call it, she said the Pool Palace
Staright from Bankhead, I said you good at it

They even got playa's and thugs doin' it too
The mo' that I drank, the more it's lookin' smooth
I's nuthin to a boss, I can do the shit too

[Hook:]

[Outro: DJ Ideal]
Hey! Hey!
The Bottom Bitch
You know, sometimes you can be blinded by your extreme emotions. I definitely was looking for answers, during that time when I wrote that song, and yeah, I was depressed and sad, and there were thoughts, but there were never actions, thankfully. But I wanted to share that side of my story, because I know there are so many other people out there that have gone through things like that, and you always feel like you’re the only one going through that. You walk out the door, and you see someone you know, and they ask you how you are, and you just have to say you’re fine when you’re not really fine, but you just can’t get into it, because they would never understand. Well, then comes along a song that speaks to you, that makes you feel like "Gosh, I can get through this if she can get through this, I can get through this".

[Chorus]
Baby, I want some of your love
Your love, your love
Baby, can I have some of your love
Your love, your love

[Verse]
I know there's lots of love in your heart
But, who you gonna give it to?
Ohhh, I'm sure there's lots of guys that you see
But, I swear they are not as cool as me
Girl, I can take you where you wanna go
If you wanna ride, we could watch a movie
Hit the beach, or just chill and get high
And we can do whatever you wanna do

[Chorus]
Baby, I want some of your love
Your love, your love
Baby, can I have some of your love
Your love, your love

[Outro]
I just wanna take it
(Take it, take it, take it, take it)
Take it slow
Said I just wanna take it
(Take it, take it, take it, take it)
Take it slow, oh

[Intro: Steve Lacy]
Hey, Steve, man, you-you've changed, man
Me? I changed?
I don't know, you're just, you're just different
Like, you're not the same Steve that I knew
I'm not gonna be the same Steve that you knew, that was
Five years ago
Why would I still be on the same shit, bro?
Shut the fuck up

[Chorus]
I change, you change (Change)
Why would one stay the same?
That's no fun
You're strange, so strange
If you choose to remain the same

[Verse 1]
When I say "change", I mean "evolve"
All my old friends, they just dissolve
Because they stayed on the same old shit
Just hung out off-campus smoking this
You see, me, I'm not that type of guy
But I used to before I found my high
But they can't grasp, they don't know why
I'm not the same Steve they used to like

[Chorus]
I change, you change (Change)
Why would one stay the same?
That's no fun
You're strange, so strange
If you choose to remain the same

[Interlude: Steve Lacy]
And you talk white now
What does that mean?
I don't even know who you are anymore, bro, like
What?
Uh, I don't know, you're weird, bro, you're weird
I'm weird?
You know, remember like, remember swimming?
Remember in eighth grade, you know what I'm saying?
We used to be jerkin', bro?
Yeah, I remember that
Like what happened to that Steve? I want him back
Oh my God

[Chorus]
I change, you change (Change)
Why would one stay the same?
That's no fun
You're strange, so strange
If you choose to remain the same

[Verse]
Girl when I miss you (When I miss you)
I get caught up (All in my feelings girl)
I wanna kiss you (Wanna kiss you)
Show you some love (Love)
Show you some love (Love)
I wanna show you some love, oh (Love, love, love)

[Intro]
Uh, ahhh!
Ayy

[Verse 1]
I can feel it deep inside my body
I've been watching all this all night
I got to move it
This pressure brewing
This world don't feel alright

[Chorus]
Everyone, everyone!
Get down, baby, get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, high
Ohh, uh
Everyone, everyone!
Get down, baby, get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, son, ahhh! Uh

[Verse 2]
No good's happenin'
World, we're out a captain
Everyone just wants a better life
Woo! They tried to kill us
Love to say they feel us
But they won't take my pride, ahh!

[Chorus]
Everyone, everyone!
Get down, baby, get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, high (Ah, uhh)
Everyone, everyone!
Get down, baby, get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, son (Woo! Uh)

[Outro]
Everyone
Get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, high
Everyone
Get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, son

[Chorus]
Have a word for your brother
Have some time for one another
Really love one another
It's so hard to find
Have a word for your brother
Have some time for one another
Really love one another
It's so hard to find

[Verse 1]
You got the power, you got the power
Of every hour,  of every hour
I come to getcha and I know where you are
I come to getcha and I know where you are
It's getting hot, it's like a sauna
Then every night, in Arizona
They come to getcha when they grope in your mind
They think you creepy, getting down in your mind
They come to getcha, they come to getcha
It doesn't matter, you making magic
I got the business to make a mind
I got the business to make a mind
And if you feel it, if you feel in your toes
And you act nothing like nobody knows
But if you want it, you got to want it

[Chorus]
Have a word for your brother
Have some time for one another
Really love one another
It's so hard to find
Have a word for your brother
Have some time for one another
Really love one another
It's so hard to find
Have a word

[Verse 2]
Come on baby, oh
Darling no, no, no, no, no, no, no
That's right baby, that's right
I see wherever, wherever, wherever you are
(Wherever, wherever, wherever you are)
I see wherever, wherever, wherever you are
(Wherever, wherever, wherever you are)
Wherever, wherever, wherever you are
(Wherever, wherever, wherever you are)
Do no wrong now
That's right, baby

[Bridge]
There's a big wide world out there, I need to get in
We have got to really stay together (we gotta stay together)
And I hope and I pray, we will find it someday
We have got to really stay together (are we staying?), so—

[Chorus]
Have a word for your brother
Have some time for one another
Really love one another
It's so hard to find
Have a word for your brother
Have some time for one another
Really love one another
It's so hard to find

[Refrain]
With a gun in your hand
I'm the boogieman
I'm gonna come and get you

[Verse 1]
If you point a gun at my rising sun
Though we're not the one
But in the bounds of your mind
We have done the crime

[Hook]
Boogieman, you've got to help us, can you?
(Yes I can)
Boogieman, you've got to help us, can you?
(Yes I can)

[Refrain]
With a gun in your hand
I'm the boogieman
I'm gonna come and get you

[Verse 2]
Every boy and girl all around the world
Knows my nigga's words
But if he's scared of me
How can we be free? Yeah

[Hook]
Boogieman, you've got to help us, can you?
(Yes I can, oh)
Boogieman, you've got to help us, can you?
(Yes I can, oh)

[Verse 1]
Daylight
I wake up feeling like you won't play right
I used to know, but now that shit don't feel right
It made me put away my pride
So long
You made a nigga wait for some, so long
You make it hard for boy like that to go on
I'm wishing I could make this mine, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want it, yeah
You can have it, oh, oh, oh
If you need it, ooh
We can make it, oh
If you want it
You can have it

[Chorus]
But stay woke
Niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin', ooh
Now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now don't you close your eyes

[Verse 2]
Too late
You wanna make it right, but now it's too late
My peanut butter chocolate cake with Kool-Aid
I'm trying not to waste my time

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want it, oh
You can have it, you can have it
If you need it, you better believe in something
We can make it, oh
If you want it
You can have it, ah

[Chorus]
But stay woke (Stay woke)
Niggas creepin' (They be creepin')
They gon' find you (They gon' find you)
Gon' catch you sleepin' (Gon' catch you sleepin', put your hands up now, baby)

But stay woke

[Hook 1]
She want to move to California
She must've fucking lost her mind
She want to move to California
That's how they get you every time

[Verse 1]
She make a movie with her friends
Put it up in a minute
Everybody say it now
Ain't no loop at the minute
Everybody saying
"How, how you do it, you did it?"
I'ma show you what it done
But enough for a finish
Pay attention, you listen
You keep losing your mind
How you want to loop this shit
But looking like a Vine?

[Pre-Hook]
But they no pay for no privilege
Now she broke in Koreatown
In the condo you rented
Better get your percentage

[Hook 2]
In California, oh
She must've fucking lost her mind, yeah
He want to move to California
He want to hang with DC Fly

[Verse 2]
All the people all around and the follower people
I go watching a "haha," make a girlfriend giggle
Make her feel so official, make it Serena Vista
Supernova, new residual, making money a little
Make the smoker illegal
Make the living illegal
Make the laughing illegal
Make it snap for a people
When you make a movie now
Know you making no difference
It's a tickle on the mind
'Fore me finish your sentence
So go pimp a like on Vine,

[Pre-Hook]
But don't pay for the privilege
Now you broke in Koreatown
In the condo you rented
Better get your percentage
Oh, you broke in Koreatown
In that condo you rented
Better get your percentage

[Hook 2]
In California
She must've fucking lost her mind, yeah
I want to move to California
I want to hang with DC Fly

[Verse: Childish Gambino]
There's a bottom to the top of a moment
You won't always be around
Catch a nigga coming quickly behind you
People want you underground
Do you misbehave?
Haunt you to your grave
I'm going to eat you alive
Please don't find me rude
But I don't eat fast food
So don't run too fast

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
Just hide, ooh!
You know that you're the one that's terrified, ooh
Just hide, ooh!
You know that you're the one that's terrified, ooh

La, la, la, la, la

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, please
Ooh-oh, no, no, no, ooh!
Oh, you can't run from me
You can't hide from me

[Verse 1]
Little hands, little feet
Tiny heart, tiny beat
Oh, thinkin' 'bout the time we spent falling in love together
I don't wanna leave you, I don't wanna deceive you
But oh, when mama cries from daddy's lies
Oh my, please don't take him away, mama
Don't take him away, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause I've had my time, oh!
Don't take my baby boy
Don't take my pride and joy
I hope I stay close, I hope I stay close

[Verse 2]
All the pain, all the tears
Many nights, many years
This love for me is fading
You waited, but I never came home to you
I've never lied about us
We were never supposed to be together
When you see me with some other one
And they know your son
Oh, please don't take him away
You say you won't but you will, yes you will

[Chorus]
'Cause I've had my time, oh!
Don't take my baby boy
Don't take my pride and joy
I hope I stay close, I hope I stay close

[Outro]
(Don't take my baby boy)
There was a time before you
And there will be a time after you
(Don't take my pride and joy)
Though these bodies are not our own
Walk tall, little one, walk tall
(I hope I stay close)
(Don't take my baby boy)
(Don't take my pride and joy)
Let me hold you, let me hold you
(I hope I stay close)
Can I hold you?

1, 2, 3, 4

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
It took five shots, and we were getting it on
And then four shots, we had nothing on
Three shots, we were out of there
Two shots, whispering in your ear
I got one shot, one shot to love you all night long

[Pre-Verse: Juicy J]
Yessir
Juicy J

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Bartender 'nother round on me
Two or three shots you goin' down on me
I'm a king, go ahead, put a crown on me
I'm an OG, only pouring Crown in my drink
Apple martini, now she in my Lamborghini
Coming out of her bikini, 'bout to rub me like a genie
Get her all alone, knock her off, then I dip
If she work it good enough, she might leave with a tip

[Pre-Chorus 1: Robin Thicke]
Two tequilas, shoot 'em down
One tequila, third round
Come with me, let me buy you a drink
I'mma tell you how the story goes

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
It took five shots, and we were getting it on
And then four shots, we had nothing on
Three shots, we were out of there
Two shots, whispering in your ear
I got one shot, one shot to love you all night long

[Pre-Verse: Juicy J]
Yessir
Robin Thicke

[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
So you sayin' you ain't from 'round here
I can tell by your accent dear
You got an "ain't been hurt yet" smile
And an "I don't give a fuck what you think" style

[Pre-Chorus 2: Robin Thicke]
Two tequilas, shoot 'em down
One tequila, third round
Now you're giving me eyes
Like you just had Henny for the first time

[Interlude: Robin Thicke]
Hey there baby
I'd be patient
But you leave town tomorrow
Oh no, let me tell you how the story goes

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
It took five shots, and we were getting it on
And then four shots, we had nothing on
Three shots, we were out of there
Two shots, whispering in your ear
I got one shot, one shot to love you all night long

[Bridge: Robin Thicke & Juicy J]
Two tequilas, shoot 'em down (hey)
Two tequilas, shoot 'em down (hey)
Two tequilas, shoot 'em down (hey, hey)
Two tequilas, come on
I got one shot, one shot to love you all night long, oh

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
All it took was two shots of tequila
Now she wanna get it in in a two-seater
She just wanna be single for a night
So I told the bartender, "give her anything she like"
Good girl, work it out
You can touch it from the south
Takin' shots, no rocks, so you know what she about
Rounds goin' down, so we order up some more
And the club 'bout to close, so she puttin' on a show
We're all stumblin' out the parking lot
Still goin' up at the afterspot
It’s your boy, Juicy J
I'm that weekend lover
Got Molly and Becky lickin' shots off each other

[Pre-Chorus 3: Robin Thicke]
Two tequilas, shoot 'em down
One tequila, third round
But you leave town tomorrow
Oh no, let me tell you how the story goes

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
It took five shots, and we were getting it on
And then four shots, we had nothing on
Three shots, we were out of there
Two shots, whispering in your ear
I got one shot, one shot to love you all night long

[Outro: Robin Thicke & Juicy J]
Two tequilas, shoot 'em down (hey)
Two tequilas, shoot 'em down (hey)
Two tequilas, shoot 'em down (hey, hey)
Two tequilas, come on
I got one shot, one shot to love you all night long, oh

[Verse 1]
When the sun is rising over streets so barren
Since the evening, colors flash before my eyes
I feel like a child, so young and new in '92
I listened to what my father said

[Chorus]
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
There is a voice inside us all
So smile when you can, when you can

[Verse 2]
How this used to feel so far and free
Now these broken souls are all I see
Fists have fallen to our side
We may cry alone, I feel we know where all of this is headed
But my mama said

[Chorus]
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
Oh I, nah, nah, nah
If you are strong, you cannot fall
If you are strong, oh no
There is a voice inside us all
So smile, ohh, when you can, ohh, when you can

[Verse 3]
If you cannot, oh!
There is more to you and me
There is more than they can see
I'm on your side, woo, oh
There is more out there
And somebody cares 'bout you
I do

[Interlude]
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
There is more out there
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall

[Outro]
Oh!
Give me a moment, oh, oh, oh
When they're gone, keep to yourself
Oh, oh, woo, oh, ooh, yeah!
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Oh! Oh!
Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
(Thanks for doing that, thank you)
Oh! Oh!
(Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall)
Ooh! Oh!

[Verse 1]
Léon I’m smart
I got myself a good guy
Oh Léon when she broke your heart
You got yourself a good gun

Oh Léon, he had a daughter
And when I saw her, I could see his sun
I watched him kiss her and it felt so boring
There must be something more than that

[Chorus]
While it was going on, I got it wrong
I hadn't figured out until you were gone, Léon, Léon
Take her back into your arms, send her flowers, what she wants
Laugh about it and move on

[Verse 2]
Léon it's all going wrong
Now I’m stuck within this lie
You say you'd die before you were gone
But when we fucked, it was alright
Oh I love to watch it when you fire
And when you kiss her well I saw right through it
I know that we had it right

[Chorus]
While it was going on, I got it wrong
I hadn't figured out until you were gone, Léon, Léon
Take her back into your arms, send her flowers, what she wants
Laugh about it and move on

[Bridge]
Léon is so slow
Another person comes and goes
Is it enough to keep you coming around?
And Léon is so slow
I used to hate watching you go
I love the feeling just before you go down

And Léon is so slow
Another person comes and goes
Is it enough to keep you coming around?
And Léon is so slow
I used to hate watching you go
I love the feeling just before you go down

[Chorus]
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me

[Verse 1]
Isolation
Trepidation
Don't fear nothing
Snake is bluffing
Whips his tail
Sends you running

[Chorus]
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me

[Verse 2]
Vegetation
Aggravation
Found him hiding
Snake is smiling
Whips his tail
Leaves you riling

[Chorus]
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me

[Refrain]
Rattle, rattle rattle
Rattle, rattle rattle
Rattle, rattle rattle

[Verse 3]
Hibernation
Altercation
Don't get angry
Snake is cranky
Whips his tail
In a frenzy

[Chorus]
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me

[Bridge]
I'm the serpent
Devil's servant
Time to meet your end
Fangs are ready for the strike
Deadly razor sharp
Poison with a single spike
While you're immobile
Screaming like a maniac after my attack
Crying like a baby child in exile
Sweat drips out of every pore as
I bite you more and more and more and
Take one last look at your captor
And hear my tail rattling 'til your death
Rattling 'til your death

[Refrain]
Rattle, rattle rattle
Rattle, rattle, rattle

[Bridge]
I'm the serpent
Devil's servant
Time to meet your end
Fangs are ready for the strike
Deadly razor sharp
Poison with a single spike
When youre immobile
Screaming like a maniac
After my attack
Crying like a baby child
In exile
Sweat drips out of every pore as
I bite you more and more and more and
Take one last look at your captor
And hear my tail rattling 'til your death
Rattling 'til your death

[Refrain]
Rattle, rattle, rattle

[Verse 1]
It's a Friday, we finally made it
I can't believe I get to see your face
You've been working and I've been waiting
To pick you up and take you from this place

[Chorus 1]
Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
Like only we can
Like only we can
Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I'm coming up and I'm loving every minute of it

[Verse 2]
You be the DJ, I'll be the driver
You put your feet up in the getaway car
I'm flying fast like a, a wanted man
I want you, baby, like you can't understand

[Chorus 2]
Oh, love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
We found a message in a bottle we were drinking
Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I hate your guts 'cause I'm loving every minute of it

[Interlude]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
I gotta leave ya, it's gonna hurt me
My clothes are dirty and my friends are getting worried
Down there below us, under the clouds
Baby, take my hand and pull me down, down, down, down

[Chorus 3]
And I'll be dreamin' of the next time we can go
Into another serotonin overflow
Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I'm busted up but I'm loving every minute of it
(Love on the weekend)
(Love on the weekend)

[Outro]
I'm looking for a little love
I'm looking for a little love, oh yeah
(Love on the weekend)
(Love on the weekend)
(Love on the weekend)

[Verse 1]
They say sing what you know
But I've sung what they want
Some folks do what they're told
But baby this time I won't
When I look through that door
I know the truth from lie
Some things I've done before I can't justify

[Pre-Chorus]
There are kings in my past
Things no one can be proud of
But I stand in the light I've cast
And turn away from any lack of love
Oh, when I walked through that door
I say here I go
You see me and nothing more
I'm singing what I know

[Chorus]
I know better
I know better

[Verse 2]
Legend is just a name
I know better than to be so proud
I won't drink in all this fame
I'll take more love than I'm allowed

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't hide or cut it off from where it came
My history has brought me to this place
This power and the color of my face

[Chorus]
And I know better
Oh, I know better

[Bridge]
Oh, I'll rise from the floor if I don't win
I'll bust open that door so let me in
And if music chooses me to sing I let her
I'll sing what I know, yes

[Chorus]
I know better, oh
I know better, yes
I know better
I know better

[Verse 1: John Legend]
All this trouble in this here town
All this shit going down
When will they focus, on this?
Streets ride up with the TV crews
Look ma, we on the news
But they didn't notice, before this
They float above the city lights
Forget the truth, inhale the lies
Just enjoy the show
They see us reaching for the sky
Just ignore that you survive

[Chorus: John Legend]
Maybe we should go
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Let's ride the elevator, they can't keep us out no more
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Penthouse floor

[Verse 2: John Legend]
All that bubbly, all that wine
Oh man, look at the times
Didn't they notice, notice?
Only future I can see, ain't what it used to be
And I didn't know this, I didn't know this
Once you're above the city lights
Won't want to spend another night, down there on your own
The whole world on display for us
The altitude is dangerous, but we ain't going home

[Chorus: John Legend]
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Let's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for
Can't keep us out no more (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Penthouse floor

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
I heard this old joke once, it was like, uh
Knock knock, who there, it's us, us who?
Just us, who dis? Just playin'
Just me, new phone, new hair, new era
I'm in the penthouse, baby
Handpicked from bad apples and bad eggs
Held back, I had to grab crab legs
And then there were only but a few
Conversations held with patience, what a party, what a view
What a dress, what a song
What a beautiful time
My folks downstairs still waitin' in line
They never been in these rooms
Never stayed with these folks
Never laughed at the news, never hated these jokes
So as I fly in my suit, in a group, undercover
Forcin' a new smile, he tells me another
He said "What happened to the boy that climbed up the trunk?"
Then he pushed me off the top and said "Jump, nigga, jump!"

[Bridge: John Legend]
Oh don’t bring me down I need a room up in the clouds
I wanna get there babe, I wanna elevate
Oh my favorite mix, a little ignorance and bliss
In the penthouse babe, go to the penthouse

[Chorus: John Legend]
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Let's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for
We'll tear down those penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Those penthouse doors
We'll tear down the penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Baby, I'm in the penthouse floor
Baby, let's ride the elevator
Til we can rise some more
Go to the penthouse floor, penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)

[Verse 1]
Can you just stay through the night?
Turn down the bed and the blinds
Before you turn around
Can you just stay through the night?
Let me breathe you in 'til gravity bends
And we fall through the hole in the light
Make this our kingdom
Somewhere where good love conquers and not divides

[Chorus]
Cause I may not know a lot of things but
I feel it in my chest
Know I won't let the blue flame die
We can't lose hope just yet
'Cause it's once, just once in a lifetime
And we're scared to love but it's alright
I may not know a lot of things but
I know that we're surefire, yeah
Know that we're surefire, yeah

[Verse 2]
Can't keep this bed warm on the left side
When something is cold as a goodbye
Why don't you turn around?
Ignore all that shit from the outside
The world is a nightmare
Wake up and stay here
Let me be on your side
We'll make this our kingdom
Somewhere where good love conquers and not divides

[Pre-Chorus]
And oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my God
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so tired of fighting
Let go, give in, let go and give up, oh

[Chorus]
I may not know a lot of things but
I feel it in my chest
Know I won't let the blue flame die
We can't lose hope just yet
'Cause it's once, just once in a lifetime
And we're scared to love but it's alright
I may not know a lot of things but
I know that we're surefire
Know that we're surefire

[Pre-Chorus]
And oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my God
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so tired of fighting
Let go, give in, let go and give up, oh

[Chorus]
I may not know a lot of things but
I feel it in my chest
If we just let the blue flame die
The devil wins this bet
Oh it's once, just once in a lifetime
And you're scared to love but it's alright
I may not know a lot of things but
I know that we're surefire
Know that we're surefire

[Verse 1]
We don't have to explain it
The beat is way too loud
Even though the lights faded
I still saw you in the crowd
When I put you in my arm
Feel it all through me
When you promise me nothing
You give me everything I need

[Pre-Chorus]
She comes over
We're both not sober
It's like we're losing our minds
We kiss like lovers
And Cupid hovers
Like he's just learning to fly
And even though it's dangerous
It's temporarily painless
I'm falling for a stranger, stranger

[Chorus]
No need to justify
Looking for a little bit of love tonight
I need somebody
You need somebody too
No need to justify
All I wanna be is your drug tonight
I need somebody
You need somebody too
I need somebody
You need somebody too
I need somebody

[Verse 2]
Don't even know what your name is
When I taste your skin
I don't wanna sound shameless
I just wanna bring your body in
Wanna put you in my place
Pay to hear you scream
You don't even have to stay
Oh but I don't think you wanna leave

[Pre-Chorus]
She comes over
We're both not sober
It's like we're losing our minds
We kiss like lovers
And Cupid hovers
Like he's just learning to fly
And even though it's dangerous
It's temporarily painless
I'm falling for a stranger, stranger

[Chorus]
No need to justify
Looking for a little bit of love tonight
I need somebody
You need somebody too
No need to justify
All I wanna be is your drug tonight
I need somebody
You need somebody too
I need somebody

[Bridge]
And even though it's dangerous
It's temporarily painless
I'm falling for a stranger, stranger
Even though it's dangerous
It's temporarily painless
I'm falling for a stranger, stranger

[Chorus]
No need to justify
Looking for a little bit of love tonight
I need somebody
You need somebody too
No need to justify
All I wanna be is your drug tonight
I need somebody
You need somebody too
I need somebody
You need somebody too
I need somebody
You need somebody too

[Verse 1]
Should've known when the cop told me I'm goin' too fast
He told me
Speed like that and it's bound to be a hell of a crash
He told me
Better late than you don't get there, do the math
Oh you oughta be grateful
For what you have

[Pre-Chorus]
Well what if I refuse to learn?
I see a flame, I wanna get burned

[Chorus]
How can I blame you
For showin' up at the party?
Lookin' through me in that way
Saw somethin' inside of me break
Saw me wanna make a mistake
How can I blame you
For takin' over my daydreams?
I wanna scream it, I'm sorry
But I can't 'cause I'm long overdue
Oh I wanna blame it on you

[Verse 2]
Why's it hard for a man to be satisfied?
Oh, I got one glimpse of the green grass on the other side
'Cause it's all been comin' to this and goddamn I won't be denied
Oh I'm gonna take one more chance tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, what if I refuse to learn?
I see the flame grow, I gotta get burned

[Chorus]
How can I blame you
For showin' up at the party?
Lookin' through me in that way
Saw somethin' inside of me break
Saw me wanna make a mistake
How can I blame you
For takin' over my daydreams?
I wanna scream it, I'm sorry
But I can't 'cause I'm long overdue
Oh I wanna blame it on you

[Bridge]
Did I know my weakness?
Did I mount all my defenses?
Did I tell you to leave me alone?
How can I blame you?
You saw somethin' inside of me break
You saw me wanna make a mistake

[Chorus]
How can I blame you?
You saw somethin' inside of me break
You saw me wanna make a mistake
How can I blame you
For takin' over my daydreams?
I wanna scream it, I'm sorry
But I can't 'cause I'm long overdue
Oh I wanna blame it on you
I wanna blame it on you
I wanna blame it on you, yeah

[Verse 1]
Nobody's buying
There ain't any truth to it
The fact is you're lying
But I'm getting used to it
Promising we'll stay together
Down in your heart, you know better
I know what I lost before it's gone

[Chorus]
Tell me slowly
Over and over again
Same old story
Over and over again
Tell me slowly
Over and over again
Over and over again

[Verse 2]
Oh, say I'm overreacting
As if you believe in that
But you answer questions
That nobody even asked
Although we may stay together
Down in your heart, you know better
You pictured all the ways that you'll move on

[Chorus]
But you just tell me slowly
Over and over again
Same old story
Over and over again
Tell me slowly
Over and over again
Over and over again

[Bridge]
I will try to pull the wool over my eyes
You thought it would keep me warm
You said it was cold outside

[Chorus]
Tell me slowly
Over and over again
Same old stories
Over and over again
Tell me slowly
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Oh, over and over again

[Outro]
Oh, say it again, yeah
Keep on, yeah
Over and over

[Verse 1]
What can you buy with the ultimate sacrifice
If you don't believe in the afterlife?
Oh I still grieve rememberin' what you were like
Now what good is a dream when the dreamer dies?

[Pre-Chorus]
Some are better than good
Greater than great
Some are misunderstood
And they get told to wait by

[Chorus]
All of the greatest
The greatest of all
We're chasing their fading star
Who'll be the latest
The latest to fall?
We're marching into the dark

[Verse 2]
What if your life was just in the day to day
And after you're gone the world stays the same?
Why should you love what you're gonna lose anyway?
Oh I've imagined one hundred ways

[Pre-Chorus]
Some are just no good
Some will let it just fade
Some are misunderstood
We'll just have to wait, 'cause

[Chorus]
All of the greatest
The greatest of all
We're chasing their fading star
Who'll be the latest
The latest to fall?
We're marching into the dark

[Bridge]
Oh Heaven knows where we are
Chasing the fading stars
Heaven knows where we are
Motioning to the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
Some are better than good
And greater than great
Some are misunderstood
They get told to wait
Some are just no good
Some will let it just fade
Some are misunderstood
We'll just have to wait, 'cause

[Chorus]
All of the greatest
The greatest of all
Were chasing their fading star
Wanna know who
Who'll be the latest
The latest to fall?
We're marching into the dark
I wanna go marching into the dark
All of the greatest
The greatest of all
Were chasing their fading star
Were chasing their fading star
Who'll be the latest
Latest to fall?
Marching into the dark

Y’all know, someone try to hate us so i breeze through
Ain't no conversation when I see you
Cowards ain't real, you niggas see through
That's why I do me, cos really
Y’all know, someone try to hate us so i breeze through
Ain't no conversation when I see you
Cowards ain't real, you niggas see through

[Verse 1]
First off, I'm a Pittsburgh veteran
Stay true to the game, nobody better than
In it for a minute, I ain't just here to set a trend
Rap slow, quick, flow sick, need medicine
Hard to get ahead and prevail, keep my head and be well
When these cops want me dead or in jail
That's why I'm moving at a fast pace, leaving you in last place
If you was brought up broke, all you know is the cash taste
You see I grind for mine, that's what you get from me
I work hard dawg, cause ain't shit for free
So youu can stand out, waiting for a hand out
Me, I'mma go get it, no win or go figure
I got a hot rhyme, stop mine? No, nigga
In the hood where the good kids turned coke flippers
Yeah, the block when there's hot summers, cold winters
Real beginners, killers hoping that the Lord forgive us

[Hook]
Y’all know, someone try to hate us so i breeze through
Ain't no conversation when I see you
Cowards ain't real, you niggas see through

Ain't no conversation when I see you
Cowards ain't real, you niggas see through

[Verse 2]
See this is more than what you used to, you dudes
Prolly won't admit I'm the truth when I'm through the roof, who
Want it with the youngin, I’m comin' at one-a same kind
Hit the ground runnin', I'm gunnin' to take the game
President putting drugs in the hood that set the trap, man
With the laws seeking, it's hard being a black man
No pop, so they flow rocks to the crack fans
I seen it all too soon, you just a rap fan
And had to earn chips, all that i'm concerned with
Learn quick, school everyday but don't learn shit
Most the teachers think I be a nigga turned stiff
I'm a wordsmith, next to nothing that you heard, prick
Yeah I'm the Burgh's prince, because i'm a sicko with the words spit
Pittsburgh been through all the Burgh's pits
Fuck what u heard it’s, enough to make a nigga turn flips
Sometimes I see why niggas turn bricks
Cause in the Burgs, shit's all about survival here
Niggas grind to get rich, most die trying here
So I'mma spit till I'm considered a pioneer
You might be hot but Khalifa bringing the fire here!
Y’all know, someone tryin to hate us so i breeze through
Ain't no conversation when i see you
Yeah, the written be real
And I hail from the ill gritty City of Steel
Let's do it!

[Hook]
Y’all know, someone try to hate us so i breeze through

What you niggas know 'bout having work, with no job
(Hey, Whoa)
Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night beside her
And you know that she's half crazy
But that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
Then she gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind

And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said "All men will be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them"
But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind

Now Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you to the river
She is wearing rags and feathers
From Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbour
And she shows you where to look
Among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind

Hold your body, your, every night
Hold your body, ohh
Hold your body, your, every night
Hold your body all night
Hold the waist, give the brain for like half a day
Till she motionless, till she motionless
Wipe the sweat, kiss the chest, 'cause she's not the same
And you touch, you, babe

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Till you're motionless
And your body gettin' numb from the sex and the rum
Till she motionless
You just wanna be with me
Till you're motionless
And your body get numb, you just wanna be touched
Till you're motionless, till you're motionless

A tear goes down my day is real
But your drying eye upon the shame
Each needs a road for me from you
What paradise? what can I do?
That die for my and the day is dark
I can’t believe for your touch
What I could find oh time is right
If I fell in love to fall in love
To fall in love with you

The day is dark, our time is right
Day in the night deep in the night
I can’t yet be back I heard my- surprise
I see it in your lips I knew it in your eyes
Well I feel your love and I feel no shame
I can’t unleash your horde I call your name
What you’re to me what can I do?
To fall in love to fall in love
To fall in love with you

It just rolls upon the sand
Ever this for now I’m made a man
Can make you see what I can find
I know it in my days ah in my daily mind
Oh will ages roll will ages fly?
I hear your name where angels lie
What do I know? for to come it’s true
To fall in love To fall in love
To fall in love with you
How can the doors trust on a nail?
How can I be surprised of most every day?
In the distant road I can’t be the same
I feel no love I feel no shame
I can’t watch the bay out on my own
We’ve a destined man I can attest it all
I didn’t I could find where I could go
To fall in love to fall in love
To fall in love with you

You really got to understand your position
You've got an opportunity to really, really truly become one of the biggest multi-millionaires to come out of the city this particular era
And the only person man, can make you fall that particular place, is yourself
You can't rely on outside man shit to effect you
Shit that you don't have no control, it should never effect you

Feel like I lost my soul, selling Os fucking hoes in the dope game
And we did it all double cross, triple cross for the love of the cocaine
The triple beams, put me in these Balmain jeans
This is why I’m Kells, this is why I’m Kells
This is why, this is why, this is why I’m Kells
I’m Kells 'cause I’m hot, you ain’t 'cause you not
This is why, this is why, this is why I’m Kells
If I’m on the hook, the shit is gonna sell
This is why, this is why, this is why I’m Kells
R&B King and I’m rolling down your block
Hits like a bomb when I let the beat drop
Southside, baby, Kells rooting for the Sox
In the club falling all over motherfuckers 'cause I'm intoxed
Girls take me home 'cause I’m good on the mattress
Yeah, I’m from the hood, but I be poking these actresses
Moral of the story is cuff your chick if she hot
May 29th, Double Up, bitch go cop

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I can never lose, chess or checkers make a move
Drippin' in them jewels like I just got out the pool
Skinny nigga sittin' on that money like the jews
Only time we make it to the TV if it's the news
We was tryna make it out them trenches, you dig?
Young niggas trappin' out them benches, you dig?
You gon' be a felon or a witness, you dig?
All this money, murderin' is senseless, it is
Fuck 'em and tell 'em if I ain't gon' feed 'em
All this money I'm gettin', prolly ain't gon' need 'em
Niggas said that we beefin', prolly ain't gon' see 'em
I'm just pushin' them buttons on 'em and they gon' leave him
That's that drumma sound, drumma sound
Bodies droppin' in the summer now, don't come around
I'm in Philly where niggas totin' them millies
They pop 'em just like they wheelies
You suckers'll never feel me, I understand it
Pitch the rock we never underhand it
Clear-port we got another landin'
Touchdown in Miami another Patek that's another Grammy
I never put the money over family
Pussies they forever fear me
That money made me a monster
No more noodles we eatin' pasta
Dick roll rappers they eat lobster
We been eatin' steak nigga we mobsters

[Verse 2: Mel Love]
We Dreamchasers, laser that beam-chaser
We need paper, scrapers, I'm speed racer
Told that bitch 

[?]

[?]
80 niggas so fake, they out of order
Hold the work it could swim and take all the water
I done motherfuckin' the 

[?] shark in the water
We done came from all the muscle
My nigga came from a quarter
To a motherfuckin' stone, puttin' in a order
Or puttin' niggas on order
Pussy 

[?]
Serve the work up out the drop I'm puttin' in on the order
Tryna get this rap money, and stack it like trap money
But others like crack money
Let's get that work from the border
Tryna line up and get it, 

[?]
I'ma line up all my nigga and fuck it I won for them
What I want for myself and fuck it don't need no help
All that we ever had, we all that we ever got
Came from onions and soda
Baking soda and pots
Arm and Hammer that's yolla, tryna bang on the block
Workin' shifts on the boat, runnin' around the clock
But fuck it I've been so hot
Send all these niggas Chasers the squad
I be different the fuck off my dick
I'm in my nine niggas trippin'
Gon' slide on who, niggas weak
And I don't fear no man so let's beef nigga

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Its a war goin' outside nobody safe from
Layin' where its no opportunity had to make some
Said it wasn't room in them rooms had to take some
When I got my foot in the door brought my day ones
A1s and they got tecs like Draymond
Chef like Raekwon, in the kitchen with napalm flame shit
Bad bitch with me gettin' her slay on
Let me in this bitch I'ma stay on
Any nigga in the way we'll pull that k on
Fill his clothes up with holes tell him get his J on, Yeezus
I'm too rich to be this reckless
Spent two bricks just on my necklace, I'm just coutin' my blessings
Young nigga started with nothin' cause I was destined
Fuck nigga runnin' the game I can't accept it
Think about it, now that Trump won the election
They gon' try and box us out like the Mexicans, ándale
Runnin' the ye, see the cops go the other way
I just bought my dawg a brick like the other day
He couldn't get his momma nothin' on Mother's Day
So I put him on help him get his money straight, that's gang
Let me get it
Niggas say they be with me, but I don't be with niggas
Diamonds shinin' like a swiper all my pieces hitin' lit
Them niggas broke they can't be beefin' with us
Put some respect up on my name all tree them niggas
I got a fetish for Lamborghinis and fettuccine
Bad bitches that never see me want to double team me
Triple double get what I want like I own a genie
Aladdin, my bitch look like Jasmine
Fuckin' with that nigga and you know he told
I'm the realest nigga on the totem pole
Chasin' down the money 'til I overload
Two bad bitches on the menu I take both of those
I don't care if they was real sisters
Niggas broke talkin' like they real niggas
Only thing that's real about 'em is that they real bitter
And real salty fuck 'em

[Break]
That's what we on too
Make sure you go get that YG Still Brazy
We came through the trenches
Ask YG when he was 23 he was givin' me Glocks like it was water

[Verse 4: Meek Mill]
Let me 

[?] an acapella before we get out of here
We gon' get to that shit when we get back
Ten years of probation, that's 3650 days shit
How I'm supposed to make it
I'm tryna work and they givin' me violations
Shackles on my ankles still runnin', dreamin', and chasin'
Runnin' out of patience, sick and tired of waitin'
My niggas turned they back to the streets and I really hate it
Fathers wasn't lovin' they sons filled 'em with hatred
Put them white cops in hood knowin' they racist
Settin' us up for failure, made us rebellious
Judge slammin' that hammer and nailed us
We was sheltered by Section 8
'Member nights when niggas barely ate
Oodles and noodles that was every day
Askin' for a second chance like askin' momma for a second plate
They hit my niggas twice they other day
We ain't grow up like the Jenners the only choice we had was fuck with Ye
Sometimes it make me want to run away
Sometimes I see my people struggle and I want to stay
Got me thinkin' will I ever put this gun away
No, I'm just tryna stay alive and survive through the rain and the fire
All this pain in my eyes
Wrote this verse with my blood see the stains on my palm
We got stains on our record so we can't get a job
Learned the game from my mom
She told me everybody ain't gon' make it and that's why
I stay to my motherfuckin' self and get this money nigga
Dreamchasers you already know we in the motherfuckin' buildin' nigga
Clue what's up, New York City what the fuck is up
We in this bitch
We visualize and dream and growin' up and being kings
Killin' for currency out to get it any means so it seems
And the good die young, at early teens in between
In the hood I'm from, we don't believe we could believe
Babies survivin' off coca leaf that dope and weed
They lock us up and they throw the keys where
Nobody can find 'em and location anonymous
Man judgin' man, man beggin' that your honor give a chance
Sons followin' the steps of fathers and
Fathers go to jail sons followin' behind 'em and
Sentence with no commas its just periods behind 'em and
If you got a felony just kiss goodbye to colleges cause ain't nobody hirin'
Fill an app try again

[?] back to sellin' weed and movin' crack 'til your retirement

[Outro: Meek Mill]
Yo what up its your boy Meek Milli
Get ready for Clud Radio you know what time it is in this bitch

Only time we make it to TV if it's the news
We was tryna make it out them trenches, ya dig?
Young nigga's trappin' out them benzes, ya dig?

All this money murder and it's senseless, it is
Fuck ima tell 'em, if i ain't gon' feed 'em

[Verse 1]
Maybe one day, I can see you
We can smile and wave, and it'll be okay
Maybe one day, it'll be cool
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings
When we start saying things
Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me
Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
And we tried hard just to fix it
But we broke it more
And so, I guess some things are not meant to last
Is it too much to ask?

[Chorus]
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (No goodbyes)
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright (All alright)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (No goodbyes)

[Post-Chorus]
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh

[Verse 2]
In a dark room
We don't have to see the light of truth between me and you
We can stay blind in the meantime
Let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate
Even though it's too late

[Chorus]
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (No goodbyes)
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright (All alright)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?

Bend a couple rules and misbehave
Welcome to my twisted cabaret

'Cause music touches me
When you choose it
Keep shuffling
But don't lose it

Music touches me
When you're choosing
Keep shuffling
Because tune age beats suffering

Tell me what you really like
Baby, I can take my time
We don't ever have to fight
Just take it step-by-step
I can see it in your eyes
'Cause they never tell me lies
I can feel that body shake
And the heat between your legs

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch and it could set you free
We don't have to rush when you're alone with me

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
You are not the single type
So, baby, this the perfect time
I'm just tryna get you high (I'm just tryin', babe)
And faded off this touch
You don't need a lonely night
So, baby, I can make it right
You just gotta let me try (Try)
To give you what you want

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch and it could set you free
We don't have to rush when you're alone with me

About ya horoscope or what the future holds
Shut up and shut up and
Let's get gory, like a Tarantino movie
Don't wanna talk it out, can we love it out?
Cause you gon' be up all night, miss a decaf
You say I'm a tall thug, guess I'm a G-raffe
If ya want safe-sex, baby use the knee pads
Freaky with the sticky icky
Baby give me kitty kitty
Killa, westside illa
Boy you like 98 degrees
And I'm 300... keep ya feet runnin'

Better boy get scurred
Don't run up in my lane, I don't want you in my lane
You a lame, get swerved

[Chorus]

But I love your bloopers
And perfect's for the urgent
Baby I want forever

[Outro]
9/11, a day that we're never forgettin'
11/9, a day that we're all regrettin'
If my president is Trump then it's relevant enough
To talk 'bout it on TV and not give a...
I'm Black, and I'm proud
My skin is brown and I'm loud
Everybody love it when a rapper tells some lies
Well that ain't me, homie, I guess that's a surprise
America wanna act all happy and holy
But deep down inside they're like Brad and Jolie
Caroline divine and I won't get specific
Club Banana the illest and it's too terrific
You can never make America great again
All you ever did was make this country hate again

[Hook]
Bad taste, bad taste in my mouth
Flag wavin', flag wavin' at a patriot's house
Lookin' for change on the couch
Mad world, mad world, that's what the TV said
Imagine tryna keep your head
While your daughter sleeps in bed
And when she wakes up, will the world be the same?
Will my girl be afraid in the home of the brave?
See I hope, I hope, that it's gon' be alright
But what a hell'uva a night

[Verse 1]
Humanity is a privilege, we can't give in
When they build walls, we'll build bridges
This is resistance, we're resilient
When they spread hate, we shine brilliant
March by the millions 'til they hear the children
We found ourselves at a distance
Open up the jails and the overcrowded cells
When we oppress anyone, we oppress ourselves
Greatest gift I ever learned is helpin' someone else
You feel fully fulfilled 'cause you forget about yourself
Service, purpose, works if you work it
Love everyone regardless of the God they worship
This isn't the apocalypse
We can't address the hate 'til we acknowledge it
If Jesus was alive, would he let Mohammed in?
This isn't nature, my daughter hugs strangers
We teach fear and preach hatred
Put up a fence, scared to meet our neighbors
Think that if we let them in, they'll take advantage of us later
There's so much anger in this world as I raise her
My daughter, hope it's a dream when I wake up tomorrow

[Hook]
Bad taste, bad taste in my mouth
Flag wavin, flag wavin' at a patriot's house
Lookin' for change in the couch
Mad world, mad world, that's what the TV said
Imagine tryna keep your head
While your daughter sleeps in bed
And when she wakes up, will the world be the same?
Will my girl be afraid in the home of the brave?
See I hope, I hope, that it's gon' be alright
But what a hell'uva a night

[Verse 2]
And we fight for the people that haven't had a voice
Fight for the first amendment, fight for freedom of choice
Fight for women's rights, if she does or doesn't carry
We ride for all the queer folk and fight for all to get married
I'm not moving to Canada, not fleein' the nation
No time for apathy, no more tears and no complainin'
Gotta fight harder for the next four and what we're faced with
Got my daughter in my arms and he is not gonna raise her

[Hook]
Bad taste, bad taste in my mouth
Glad wave, I'm glad wavin' at a Patriot's house
Lookin' for change in the couch
Mad world, mad world, that's what the TV said
Imagine tryna keep your head
While your daughter sleeps in bed
And when she wakes up, will the world be the same?
Will my girl be afraid in the home of the brave?
See I hope, I hope, that it's gon' be alright
But what a hell'uva a night

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
I been poppin', just took three in a row
I'm down to do it again, I'm on a roll
I've seen him outside tryna reach her
You tryna leave him, you said I'm the reason
Tell me lies, ooh, girl, tell me lies
Say you're mine, I'm yours for the night
I'm the realest, she said I'm the realest
Head be genius, dick game be the meanest

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I'm like, got up, thank the Lord for the day
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
Yeah
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Oh, yeah (Yeah)
Got up, thank the Lord for the day
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Bitches in my new spot, crowdin' up my space
Had to check the safe, check the dresser for my chains
Got up, thank the Lord for the day
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Bitches in my new spot, crowdin' up my space
Had to check the safe, check the dresser for my chains

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Never say never, yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
See I never thought that I could walk through fire
I never thought that I could take the burn
I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reached the point of no return

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down, I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up and never say never
Never say never
Never say never
Never say never

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I never thought I could feel this power
I never thought that I could feel this free
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
'Cause there's just no turning back, oh no
When your heart's under attack, oh no
Gonna give everything I have
'Cause this is my destiny

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up
And never say never

[Verse 3: Jaden Smith & Justin Bieber]
Here we go, guess who?
J Smith and JB, uh huh
I gotcha lil bro, I can handle them
Hold up, aight? I can handle them
Now he's bigger than me, taller than me
And he's older than me and stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me
I be tryna chill, they be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the Force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water with blood, swish
I gotta be the best, and yes, we're the flyest
Like David and Goliath, I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars, so the moon's where I land, I'm gone

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Jaden Smith]
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up
And never say never
Never say never
Never say never
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up and never say never

[Outro: Justin Bieber & Jaden Smith]
Never say never, never say never (never say it)
Never say never and never say never (never say it)
Never say never, never say never (never say it)
And never say never
Never say never and never say never (never say it)
Never say never and never say never (never say it)
Never say never and never say never
And never say never

[Verse 1: Carmody]
Wander with me, we can disappear
Hands still touching
So you know I'm near
Wander with me, streets will hold us down
Leave it all now
'Cause I need you around, around, around...

[Chorus: Carmody]
And baby it's alright with me
I can be all that you need
Baby it's alright with me
Wander, wander, wander
And baby, it's alright with me

You felt nothing
Now you never feel alone
Wander with me, winter won't let go
A dream of sunlight
Lining your shadow

And baby it's alright with me
I can be all that you need
Baby it's alright with me
Wander, wander, wander
And baby, it's alright with me
I can be all that you need
Baby, it's alright with me
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright

[Intro: The Weeknd]
Uh, uh, uh, uh-uh, uh, yeah, like

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I ran out of tears when I was eighteen
So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me, then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga, then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever "son" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never makin' money, ah
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pullin' up in Aventadors
Just know we been grindin' on them sidewalks

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They show me all the signs

[Post-Chorus: Daniel Wilson]
They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Say, say, say
I come from murder one, brung late night melee
Say, say, say
We hung all summer, sprung mattress with bae bae
Say, say, say
Trippin' off Dyke and my name strike with pay day
Say, say, say
Flippin' blue lightnin', tightenin', strapped with AK
Say, say, say
OG one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
How to segue
Pussy, power, profit and headache
I reminisce my life innocence or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Light limo tint with light women, dark women in it
Aw, Kenny, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous
I line 'em up, we grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us have probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head (Head)
Head, head, more head (Head)
Oh God, bless the dead (Yup)
I'm livin' life, high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
I wanna cop more land, I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything, I'm a hustler, came from

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Sidewalks saved my life (Sidewalks saved my life)
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life (Sidewalks saved my life)
They show me all the signs

[Post-Chorus: Daniel Wilson]
They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on

[Verse 1]
I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you (Yeah)
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh

[Chorus]
Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah (Say)

[Verse 2]
I'm findin' ways to manipulate the feelin' you're goin' through
But, baby girl, I'm not blamin' you
Just don't blame me, too, yeah
'Cause I can't take this pain forever
And you won't find no one that's better
'Cause I'm right for you, babe
I think I'm right for you, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh

[Chorus]
Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you, uh
Baby, I would die for you, yeah

[Bridge]
I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby
I'm just sayin', yeah
I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na

[Chorus]
Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah (Oh, babe)

[Outro]
(Die for you)

[Intro: The Weeknd]
Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
The reasons I can't have you are so easy to fix
I didn't really plan to, but I'ma do it for thi-is
The reasons I can't have you isn't so complicated
Baby, if you let me, I won't hesita-ate

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
All I know, all I know is this
All I know, all I know is this
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
I know there's been stigma 'round me
I know you heard things about me
You sleep one eye closed, too scared to get heartbroke
Heard too many lies told, don't make this shit my fault
I could tell why you would doubt me
I hit one time and you can't live without me
Girl, I'm just peakin', I'm just tryna be on top of you
On top of you

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Future]
All I know (All I know, all I know, all I)
All I know is this (All I know, all I know, all I)

S-s-sleep with one eye open
I'm terrified to get my heart broke
Blood talkin' like a Piru
Fuck with me, nigga, you gon' die slow (Gang)
Lamborghini make you Crip walk (Skrrt)
I'm smashin' off with my side ho
Full of these medicals, bitches, got several
She eat the dick up like it's an edible
Then I get back to my capital
I got the Glock on the passenger
I got these tropical fantasies
They gon' remember my legacy
Hang out the roof of the Ghost
The cash in my pocket spill right on the floor
The cash in my pocket spill out on the floor
When the cash overflow, let the cash overflow
I done fucked a bitch that bougie (Yeah)
Have you ever, ever fucked a bitch that bougie? (Oh-ooh)
I done fucked a bitch that bougie
I done, I done, I done fucked a bitch that bougie (Oh-ooh)
I done fucked a bitch conceited

I know like you know
You just another body (Oh)
I know like you know
I keep that trigger beside me (Keep that trig', oh, oh)
I know like you know
You just another body (Just another body)
Have you fucked a bitch this pretty?
Hit her on the first night and went and bought titties
Have you fucked a bitch this pretty?
Hit her on the first night and went and bought titties (Bought what?)
Niggas always sneak dissin'
We gon' continue fuckin' they bitches
I ain't just fuckin' that bitch
I been the one makin' love to that bitch

[Chorus: Future]
All I know (All I know, all I know, all I)
All I know is this (All I know, all I know, all I)
All I know (All I know, all I know, all I know)
All I know is this
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this
(All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this) Is this, is this

[Verse 1]
I realized I belong to you
I feel the darkness when away from you, hey yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't stop your lovin', walk out on me
Don't stop for nothin', you're what I bleed
I learned to love you, the way you need
'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same

[Chorus]
I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
(Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin')
I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
(Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin') Yeah
I was too busy tryna find you with someone else
The one I couldn't stand to be with was myself
'Cause I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
(Nothin', nothin', nothin')

[Verse 2]
Pick up your phone, I got a question, oh
If I die tonight, would you regret it? Woah-woah

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't stop your lovin', it's all I have
'Cause I can't function, no, I won't last
I swear I'll love you just like the past
'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same

[Chorus]
I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
(Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin') Oh
I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
(Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin')
I was too busy tryna find you with someone else
The one I couldn't stand to be with was myself
'Cause I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
(Nothin', nothin', nothin')

[Outro]
When I feel the love, girl, I hesitate
It's what I'm guilty of, oh yeah
I can't get enough, I'm insane
Without your touch, touch, touch
I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you

[Verse 1]
Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go
If it ain't XO, then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go lo mein (Oh-oh-oh)

[Chorus]
You know me (Know me, uh, na-na-na-na-na)
You know me (Know me, know me, oh-oh-oh)
You know me (Know me, know me, na-na-na-na-na)
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (Pow, pow)
You know me (Know me)

[Verse 2]
Said I'm just tryna swim in somethin' wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixin' up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sippin' on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singin' while I'm burnin' up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, makin' sure I'm gettin' home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk 'round with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight, eatin' all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you

[Chorus]
'Cause you know me (Oh-oh-oh)
You know me (Know me, ah, na-na-na-na-na)
You know me (Know me, know me, oh-oh-oh)
You know me (Know me, know me, na-na-na-na-na)
Every time you try to forget who I am (Try to forget who I am)
I'll be right there to remind you again (Hey)
You know me (Pow, pow)
You know me (Know me, know me)

[Bridge]
Why don't you shake somethin', shake somethin'
For the Don? Don't you break nothin', break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work somethin', work somethin'
For the Don? Don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'
Baby girl, won't you shake somethin', shake somethin' (Shake some)
For the Don? Don't you break nothin' (Break nothin'), break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work somethin' (Work), work somethin'
For the Don? Don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'

[Refrain]
'Cause you know me
Girl, you know me
You already know me
Yeah, you know me

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh, na-na-na-na-na
Oh-oh-oh, na-na-na-na-na
Oh-oh-oh, na-na-na-na-na
Oh-oh-oh, na-na-na-na-na

[Verse: Lana Del Rey]
I had a vision
A vision of my nails in the kitchen
Scratchin' counter tops, I was screamin'
My back arched like a cat
My position couldn't stop, you were hittin'
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, starboy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it (I love it), starboy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, starboy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, starboy

[Outro: The Weeknd]
I just wanna see you shine 'cause I know you are a stargirl
I just wanna see you shine 'cause I know you are a stargirl
I just wanna see you shine 'cause I know you are a stargirl
I just wanna see you shine 'cause I know you are a stargirl

[Intro: Mustafa The Poet]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Baby, you were so strong
Baby, you were calm, you were so calm, yeah
Tell me where it went wrong
Tell me how to love, it's been so long
When a call's not enough, yeah
And you just need to touch
Thinkin' twice I'm the one, yeah
But you just need to trust

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
You're only lookin' for attention
You only notice it 'cause I'm never around
You're only lookin' for attention, oh, oh, babe
You're only lookin' for attention
The only problem is you'll never get enough
You're only lookin' for attention, oh, oh woah

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
What do you expect now?
Only thing left is the sex now
'Cause baby too vexed now
Only see me on the TV or the bed now
When a touch not enough, yeah
You were more than a fuck
Thinkin' twice I'm the one
But you just need to trust

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
You're only lookin' for attention
You only notice it 'cause I'm never around
You're only lookin' for attention, oh, oh, babe
You're only lookin' for attention
The only problem is you'll never get enough
You're only lookin' for attention, oh, oh woah

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, attention
Ooh, ooh (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ooh (Love all the attention, baby), attention (Love all the attention)

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
You're only lookin' for attention
You only notice it 'cause I'm never around
You're only lookin' for attention, oh, oh, babe
You're only lookin' for attention
The only problem is you'll never get enough
You're only lookin' for attention, oh, oh woah, yeah

[Outro: Mustafa The Poet & The Weeknd]
Oh, oh (Yeah), oh, oh (Yeah)
Oh, oh (Yeah), oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Heaven in her mouth, got a hell of a tongue
I can feel her teeth when I drive on a bump
Fingers lettin' go of the wheel when I cum
Whe-wheel when I cum, whe-wheel when I cum
David Carradine, I'ma die when I cum (Die when I cum)
She just givin' head, she don't know what I done
Like I'm James Dean, I'ma die when I'm young (Die when I'm)
Die when I'm young (Die when I'm), die when I'm young

[Pre-Chorus]
Heaven knows that I've been told
Paid for the life that I chose
If I could, I'd trade it all
Trade it for a halo
Yeah, she said that she'll pray for me
I said it's too late for me
'Cause I think it's safe to say

[Chorus]
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
No ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life

[Verse 2]
Valhalla's where all the righteous are led
Mulholland's where all the damned will be kept
Devil on my lap and a cross on my neck
Cro-cross on my neck, cro-cross on my neck
Over forty-five, I'ma drift on a bend
Do a buck twenty, I'ma fly off the edge
Everybody said it would hurt in the end
Hurt in the end, but I feel nothin'

[Pre-Chorus]
She said that she'll pray for me
I said it's too late for me
'Cause I think it's safe to say

[Chorus]
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
No ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life (Woah-oh-oh)
This ain't ordinary life (Woah-oh-oh)

Angels all singin' in monasteries, yeah
My soul is burning in LaFerraris
Father, sorry, Father, sorry
Halos are given to ordinary lives
No, but this ain't ordinary life

[Chorus]
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
No ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life (Woah-oh-oh)

[Intro]
Mmm, もう待てないよ
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
People always talk about the ones that got away
I just seem to get the ones that always want to stay
I'm just too distracted with the life I'm tryna paint
Yeah, yeah (Uh), oh yeah, yeah (Ooh, said)
I got all these women too attracted to the fame
Got too many niggas that are ignorin' the way
Nothing's gonna stop me, I'ma get it either way
Yeah, yeah (Uh), oh yeah, yeah (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Why would you wanna take away from this moment?
We can own it
Why would you wanna take away from this moment?
Woo-hoo

[Chorus]
You don't have to spend your life with me
You don't have to waste your energy
We can just be rockin', yeah
We can just be rockin', yeah
I just want your body next to me
'Cause it brings me so much ecstasy
We can just be rockin', yeah
We can just be rockin', yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
You see me textin', baby, you see those missed calls
I'm actin' reckless baby, I'm 'bout to lose it all
This liquor got me crazy, mixed with that Adderall
I'm focused on the beat, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Why would you wanna take away (Don't take away)
From this moment? (From this moment)
We can own it (We can own it)
Why would you wanna take away (Don't you take away)
From this moment? (Oh)
Woo-hoo (Hey)

[Chorus]
You don't have to spend your life with me (You don't have to spend it)
You don't have to waste your energy (Uh)
We can just be rockin', yeah
We can just be rockin', yeah (We can just be rockin')
I just want your body next to me (Oh, hey)
'Cause it brings me so much ecstasy
We can just be rockin', yeah
We can just be rockin', yeah, yeah, yeah (We can just be rockin', baby)

[Bridge]
Yeah
Yeah
Hey
Come on, baby
Tryna be, yeah
Let's go, hey

[Chorus]
You don't have to spend your life with me (You don't have to spend your life with me, yeah)
You don't have to waste your energy (You don't have to waste it)
We can just be rockin', yeah (Oh, baby)
We can just be rockin', yeah (Uh, oh, you got to, need to know, oh woah)
I just want your body next to me (Hey)
'Cause it brings me so much ecstasy (Yeah)
We can just be rockin', yeah (Oh)
We can just be rockin', yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Intro]
Ah, yeah (It's like this, like this)
This is Eminem, baby, back up in that motherfucking ass
('Til forever, 'til forever)
One time for your motherfuckin' mind (For MC's, MC's)
We represent the 313, you know what I’m saying?
Yo, they don’t know shit about this, for the '96

[Verse 1]
Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin', the zany actin' maniac in action
A brainiac in fact, son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks run
My rhymin' skills got you climbin' hills
I travel through your mind, and chill your spine like siren drills
I'm slimin' grills of roaches, with spray that disinfects
And twistin' necks of rappers
'Til their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue
Turn your system up, twist 'em up
And indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more car-tunes than animation
My lamination of narration
Hits a snare and bass on a track for duck rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion
There ain't no time to be starin', gazin'
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland

[Hook]
I'm Infinite; you heard of Hell
Well, I was sent from it
I went to it, serving a sentence
For murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite

[Verse 2]
Bust it! I let the beat commence
So I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince
A crew to stomp, and then two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper than a jeep-full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's, and stand the lonely one
Imitator, intimidator, stimulator
Simulator of data eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
My thesis'll smash a stereo to pieces
My a cappella releases classic masterpieces
Through telekinesis, it eases you mentally
Gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite

[Hook]
I'm Infinite; you heard of Hell
Well, I was sent from it
I went to it, serving a sentence
For murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite

[Verse 3]
Man, I got evidence, I'm never dense
And I've been clever ever since my residence was hesitant
To do some shit that represents the MO
So I'm assuming all responsibility
‘Cause there's a monster will in me
That always wants to kill MCs
Mic nestler, slammin' like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
No one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
I get cynical, act a fool, then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy
In fact, I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin'
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo
On my last jam, plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, ‘cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit, and tempted
When I see the sins my friends commit

[Hook]
I'm Infinite; you heard of Hell
Well, I was sent from it
I went to it, serving a sentence
For murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite

[Outro]
'95, '96 ('96)
And on and on and on (and on and on)

[Intro]
Learning, learning, learning
Learning, learning, learning

[Verse 1]
When I was six years old, I kinda wet the bed
My stepdad came in and nearly beat me to death
All bruised and broken, I was lonely and scared
My mom, she was working, there was nobody there
My nana showed up, she was super protective
Had a tear in her eye, she saw how I was neglected
The crazy part about it, she's a straight-up detective
But you never would've guessed it how she'd cook you a breakfast
Three weeks later, she had him locked in a cell
Now I'm seven years old with a story to tell
Sing it

[Chorus]
I'm gonna let it go (Learning, learning)
Forgiveness is something we gotta know (Learning, learning)
'Cause if you hold on forever, it'll hurt your soul
That's why I'm learning how to let it go (Learning, learning)
That's why I'm learning how to let it go

[Verse 2]
Now middle school's here, a new chapter in life
New stepdad too, made my mama his wife
Got new problems now, like tryna fit in
Getting looked down on just because of your skin
It's bad enough, I can't afford them clothes
Got high waters on with holes in my sole
Now, that's the type of stuff to put a hole in your soul
But I, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna

[Chorus]
I'm gonna let it go (Learning, learning)
Forgiveness is something we gotta know (Learning, learning)
'Cause if you hold on forever, it'll hurt your soul
That's why I'm learning how to let it go (Learning, learning)
That's why I'm learning how to let it go
Let it go (Learning, learning)
Yeah

[Verse 3]
I'm grown up now, I learned enough for a song
Still got some friends (Yeah), but most of 'em gone (They gone)
Overdoses or killed by a gun
Breaking into houses, life on the run
Did it for his kid, now he won't be around
Guess the little one's gonna be just like me now
If you're carrying the bitterness around on your shoulders
Just remember what I told you
Sing it

[Chorus]
I'm gonna let it go (Learning, learning)
Forgiveness is something we gotta know (Learning, learning)
'Cause if you hold on forever, it'll hurt your soul (hurt your soul)
That's why I'm learning how to let it go (Learning, learning)
That's why I'm learning how to let it go (Come on, learning learning)
I'm learning how to let it go

[Verse 1]
I wish I was there more than I am, babe
These lonely nights take a toll on a man
You don’t understand it
It's so unfair that Christmas is all throughout the air
And I hate that we're both alone
I'd rather be with you by the mistletoe

[Pre-Chorus]
It hurts me more than what you think it does
When nights get cold, that's when I miss your touch
The snow is falling and it won't let up
Okay, I'm on my way, hey

[Chorus]
Cause it'll be nothing without you
Christmas will be nothing without you, girl
So I'm coming home, yeah, I'm coming home
Yeah, I'm coming home to the one that I love
It'll be nothing without you, oh

[Verse 2]
I'm ready to go, packed up and 'bout to hit the road
It may not be at the time that you want, but I'm coming, baby
Wait a little bit longer and I'll be there before you know
So tonight, just wait up for me
Don't you dare try to go to sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
It hurts me more than what you think it does
When nights get cold, that's when I miss your touch
The snow is falling and it won't let up
Okay, I'm on my way, hey

[Chorus]
Cause it'll be nothing without you
Christmas will be nothing without you, girl
So I'm coming home, yeah, I'm coming home
Yeah, I'm coming home to the one that I love
It'll be nothing without you

[Bridge]
So I'm coming home, yeah, I'm coming home
Yeah, I'm coming home to the one that I love
So I'm coming home, yeah, I'm coming home
Yeah, I'm coming home to the one that I love
Coming home, yeah, I'm coming home to the one that I love
Coming home, yeah, I'm coming home to the one that I love
So I'm coming home, yeah, I'm coming home to the one that I love
Coming home, yeah, I'm coming home to the one that I love, yeah

[Verse 3]
As soon as I walk through the door
Baby, all that I want is to see you with nothing but a ribbon on
Let me show you how it's supposed to go
No, it ain't the north pole
Sit on daddy lap, girl, ain't no getting off
I'm sorry that I took so long, but I'm so glad that I came on
It may not have been when you want
But the love so good, you'll forget it by the end of this song

[Outro]
Coming, coming home
Coming home
I'mma be there, I'm
Said I'm coming home, coming home
Coming home to the one that I love
Oh, baby, girl, I'm so damn glad that I'm coming home
I'mma be there, I'mma, I'mma, I'mma be there
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Merry Christmas
I told you. But if I would have voted, I would have voted on Trump. 

[audience boos]

Now, there’s people that I love that did vote that voted for Hillary and I don’t love them no less because they had their opinion. I love friends that I have that voted on Hillary. My manager, Scooter Braun, voted on Hillary. One of my management team. My other manager, Izzy, I’m gonna assume voted on Hillary. Everybody said that if you voted on Trump you have to go back to like Montauk or shit. And guess what? That entire team still put together this show tonight with people with differences of opinion, still put this show together tonight and still came together and made this show for y’all. They told me, “Ye, do not say that out loud. Whatever you do, do not say that out loud.” And I just said it! I wanted to say that before the election and they told me, “Do not say that out loud. Whatever you do, do not say that.” That don’t mean that I don’t think that Black Lives Matter. That don’t mean I don’t think that I’m a believer in women’s rights. That don’t mean I don’t believe in gay marriage. That don’t mean that I don’t believe in these things because that was the guy I would have voted for.

Run the next song.

Believe that there are people here enjoying, or before I start talking at least, enjoying a Kanye West show. By a show of screams do you believe that there are people at a Kanye West show who voted for Trump? 

[audience screams] Oh, it sound differently from before, huh? It sounds different. Why did we boo the first time on something that wasn’t, “Hey, do you like Trump?” That wasn’t what I asked. I asked you to give me your facts because the internet was giving you their facts based on what you wanted to hear and a lot of you guys got blindsided.

How that make you think, though? The fact that I just asked that undeniable question? That in most music situations you have the Democrats always since the beginning of time. The Democrats were considered to be more liberal. The Democrats were supposed to be more futuristic in their approach. The Democrats were supposed to have more empathy and be more about the people and that relates directly to music and it also relates to celebrity and the idea of what music does for you. Democrat is like music to your ears or something. Bye. Your voices. Do you believe–what percentage of people here–and by the way, I’m not setting y’all up, I’m not setting y’all up I’ve got no time for bullshit–what I’m saying is, what percentage of people here do you think voted for Trump? Do you think it was two people here? Do you think maybe it was 100 people? Do you think maybe it was 1,000 people out of the 15,000 people here? No, I’m asking you, what do you really believe? One person. Two people. What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe?

I haven’t talked about anybody’s stances on anything. I haven’t talked about any quote that anybody gave from either side. That’s not what I’m talking ’bout. That’s not what I’m asking you. What I’m asking you is what you really believe. I put something that I would bet on. I bet that it might be 20 percent or maybe even 30 percent of this very audience right here that might have voted for Trump. I bet you 15 percent, 50 percent of them, would never say that at a Kanye West show because of the climate right now. And they don’t know they might think I’m like, “Oh, they voted for Trump... y’all should go ahead and….” It’s the opposite of that. People got the right to vote for whoever they want to vote for. That’s the right to vote! That is our right! I did not vote. Aww, no. The Saint Pablo ticket sales are going down now. Aww no, t-shirts. “Aww nah, you just got out of jail Ye. You had to deal with the Taylor Swift shit for seven years now you gonna go say some... naw, Ye don’t say shit. Just step out.” Fuck that, bro. That’s the reality.

Well, Ye, how you gonna expect people to vote for you if you ain’t even vote? I’m concerned not about the idea of being president or the actual job of it. I’m concerned about putting our concept of how to do the job in a new way. And if no one will do it in that way I will take position in 2020 and do it myself. “Aw you ain’t gonna get it now because of what you just said.” It was proof that it didn’t matter what nobody just said! It doesn’t matter!

It might have been a reporter who wanted to use this as an opportunity to say, “Oh, this rapper” because when they call me a rapper they try to say that I’m less than thinking, less than a philosopher. But rappers are the philosophers of our now. The rappers all form a sense of our now. The celebrities are the influencers of our now. Just look at the president. He wasn’t even in politics and he won! That shows you not if you mad about him winning, but that shows you the level of possibility that is out there if you go and find information and don’t believe everything the fucking internet is telling you! There is possibilities! There’s possibilities inside of books. There’s possibilities when you call grandmother. Motherfuckers be on the internet way more than they calling they mother or they grandmother. To get information that would have you wrong as fuck like everybody knows a couple days ago! Do you ever want to be blindsided like that?

Don’t trivialize what I was saying when I talked about our president’s approach to the campaign when I said it was entertaining. I don’t think his approach was just entertaining, because that trivializes it, I actually think that his approach was absolutely genius because it fucking worked! Next song.

Oh shit, you threw something at me. Does anyone else wanna throw something at me? But, you know what, I got the power to get that guy kicked out, or whatever, roughed up. No. Stay here. What do you believe? That’s your opinion. Express your opinion, bro. Express your opinion. Thank you. That’s a woman right there saying, “I love you,” after I just said that there was things that I liked about Trump’s campaign. That’s not supposed to happen, right? No! That’s not supposed to happen, right? Case in point. Aw, no. Well, no. I guess we’re not gonna sell out the rest of the tour now. There’s methods, nonpolitical methods to speaking that I like that I feel were very futuristic and that style and that method of communication has proven that it can be a politically correct way of communication. And I fuck with that. You threw something at me! Naw, he wanted me to sign his Yeezy.

I don’t say 2020 out of disrespect to our president at all. I’m not saying that, “Aw man, that just mean that anybody can win.” That’s not what I’m saying when I say 2020. I’ll just say I got some ideas about the way that we should connect our ideas. And we should use opposite parties that the Republicans, that the Democrats, that everyone that ran that had an idea that people agreed with should be the collective ideas that are used to run the country. And that should mean more. So there's things that Benjamin Carson believes in... that I believe in. I believe that Benjamin Carson should still be a consultant. I think that Hillary Clinton should still be a consultant. I think that Bill Clinton should still be a consultant. Obama said... I think Obama should still be a consultant. It’s that, “Oh, I don’t fuck with your principles so now I’m not gonna give you no information that could help you help all of us.” Make sure this dude that got the Yeezy get his Yeezy back, specifically. Hey, security, get it back.
Man, and you know what also? I’m not saying this to diss celebrity and that all who are particularly on the Democratic side, that’s cool, I just like... I hate the fact that because I’m a celebrity everybody told me not to say that I loved the debates. I loved his approach. It’d be like white people that’s racist running around saying “niggas” now. If people are racist and they feel more inspired to say how they feel then they exposing themselves, bro. This is what I’m saying. It’s already the beginning of change. Sometimes things that you might think are bad have to happen in order for change to fucking happen. Sometimes you might have to not get your way to really understand what to do in the future to be able to get your way.

[Verse 1]
There was a boy whose name was Jim
His friends, they were very good to him
They gave him tea, and cakes, and jam
And slices of delicious ham

[Hook]
Oh Mother, tell me more

[Bridge]
Why’d 'ya have to leave me there
Hanging in my infant air
Waiting?
You only have to read the lines
They’re scribbly black and everything shines

[Verse 2]
The chief defect of Henry King
Was chewing little bits of string
At last he swallowed some which tied
Itself in ugly knots inside
Wandering and dreaming
The words have different meaning
Yes they did

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
In finding she was left alone
Went tiptoe to the telephone, 999
And summoned the immediate aid
Of London's Noble Fire Brigade

[Verse 4]
For all the time spent in that room
The doll’s house, darkness, old perfume
And fairy stories held me high
On clouds of sunlight floating by

[Hook]
Oh Mother, tell me more Tell me more

[Outro]
Aaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaah
In a while
I find the time to make the sunshine mine
In a smile
I saw a single eagle in the sky
Wheeling, soaring, gliding by
Wheeling, soaring, gliding by

[Verse 1]
All this love, is all I am
A ball is all I am
I'm so new compared to you
And I am very small

[Chorus]
Warm glow, moon gloom
Always need a little more room
Waiting here seems like years
I will see the sunshine show

[Verse 2]
All around I hear strange sounds
Come drifting round my ears
Dark the light and long the night
I feel my dawn is near

[Chorus]
Warm glow, moon gloom
Always need a little more room
Waiting here seems like years
I will see the sunshine show

[6 minute guitar outro]

[Verse 1]
Picked her up
I said "What's good"
She said "Boy, you misunderstood"
She's always in a bad mood but, tonight she wanna take the wood
(Vroom)
Turn on the car
Drive me somewhere where we could see all the stars
I always turn the lights on but, she wanna fuck in the dark
Agendas, always on the mental
Always gotta plan for what happens in advance
She not a player she just crush a lot
She call me daddy 'cause she miss her pops
I'm a drug song credit card
She wanna love but that's typical
And she just fucks she don't make love
'Cause shawty's only worried 'bout her paystubs

[Hook]
I try to be the one that she really wants
But then I think is this what she really wants
When you treat someone like you supposed to
And they end up blaming you to hate you, uh-huh
Is that a human trait
Or is it just a game

[Verse 2]
Plot twist
I'm back once again
The girl from the first verse wanna be friends
It's funny how things turn around, yeah
And everything's full circle now
I got a thing for girls who can rock my world
And the way I spit make 'em say some shit like
"I miss you and you miss me too"
You know that's a lie girl bye

[Bridge]
Got a thing for them girls who can read me
Summer days are the days when you see me
Remember when we used to ride to that Yeezy
Oh that reminds me, you still got my CD

[Prehook]
Men lie, women lie, nobody the same
People got a thing for playing so many games
I loved you the most when you loved me the least
And now that I'm gone you can see what I mean singing

[Hook]
She tries to be the one that I really want
But then I think is this what I really want
When you treat someone like you supposed to
And they end up blaming you to hate you, uh-huh
Is that a human trait
I think it's just a game

[Outro]
Dada-dada da
Dada-dada-dada-dada da
Dada-dada da
Dada-dada-dada-dada da
Dada mm dada mm da mm da dada-dada eh
Refrão
Drive my heart into the night
You can drop the keys off in the morning
(In the morning)
Cause I don't want to leave home, without your
Love
Without it

Verso - Pablo Nunes
Ahh então deixa eu sonhar
Pois eu quero conquistar
Tocar cada coração, sentir toda emoção
No flow já vou irmão na mente
Mais tatuado de sonho do que Malkaa
Um brinde com a Miley, curtindo mo vibe
A beira-mar

Verso Miley
I thought you would be there when I go
You promised you would be there when I go
But all the broken promises I won't miss
I'm finished
All I know are the facts
That when I look you in the eyes
All I see are the lies
Been there, done that
Refrão
Drive my heart into the night
You can drop the keys off in the morning
(In the morning)
Cause I don't want to leave home, without your
Love
Without it

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Ask around about her
She don't get emotional
Kill off all her feelings
That's why she ain't approachable
She know her pussy got a fanbase (No, no)
A couple niggas with a suitcase
Suit and tie niggas who play roleplay
When it comes to money, she play no games

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
She lick it up just like a candy (Candy)
She wanna make 'em leave they family (Family)
She tryna live a life so fancy (Fancy)
She wanna pull up in a Bentley (Bentley)
She ain't got time for lovin' (Lovin')
Louis Vuitton her husband (Husband)
She'd rather die in lustin' (Lustin')
She'd rather die in the club till she

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Future]
Six feet under, she gon' get that fuckin' paper (That fuckin' paper)
Six feet under, she gon' get that fuckin' paper (That fuckin' paper)
Six feet under, she gon' get that fuckin' paper
You know how she get down, pop it for a check now
Six feet under, six, six feet under (That fuckin' paper)
Six feet under, six, six feet under (That fuckin' paper)
Six feet under, she gon' kill me for that paper
Not the type to fuck around, go'n and turn that ass around

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
She don't depend on anybody
Know just what to do with her own body
Countin' all that money like a hobby
She don't give a fuck about nobody
And she got her whole crew poppin'
And she bend it over like she got no backbone
Got a couple niggas blingin' up a trap phone
She don't need nobody waitin' back home, she got it

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
She lick it up just like a candy (Candy)
She wanna make 'em leave they family (Family)
She tryna live a life so fancy (Fancy)
She wanna pull up in a Bentley (Bentley)
She ain't got time for lovin' (Lovin')

[Post-Chorus: Future & The Weeknd]
Go'n and turn that ass around (Yeah, yeah)
Oh, murder, oh, murder
Go'n and turn that ass around
Oh murder, oh murder

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
Real love's hard to find (Real love's hard to find)
So she don't waste her time (So she don't waste her time)
So she don't waste her time, oh
You ain't gon' catch her cryin' (You ain't gon' catch her cryin')
She ain't gon' lose her mind (Mind)
She ain't gon' lose her mind till she

[Outro: Future & The Weeknd]
Six feet under, she gon' kill me for that paper (Till she)
Six feet under, she gon' kill me for that paper (Till she)
Six feet under, she gon' kill me for the paper
Not the type to fuck around, go'n and turn that ass around

[Verse 1]:
Broken politics, I wonder if
You can change my mind
I move to the flicker of the lights
Say goodbye to the high
I'm shutting out all the messages
Breaking down again
Breaking from your grip
Do you miss me?
Yeah, am I making sense?
I don't know
At least I tried
At least I tried
I'm getting tired
Of running
And wearing this broken crown

[Chorus]:
I'll fight for it
I swear I'll never lose the passion
When I'm down
Can I call out your name?
I swear I'll never lose the passion
When I'm down
Can I call out your name?

[Verse 2]:
I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry
Just wanna take what's mine
And do it all in time
Remember who we are
Remember who we are
When we are apart
This love is dark
It's dark

[Chorus]:
I'll fight for it
I swear I'll never lose the passion
When I'm down
Can I call out your name?
I swear I'll never lose the passion
When I'm down
Can I call out your name?

[Bridge]:
I don't wanna cry
Myself to sleep
I'll stay awake
So I can dream
Of you and I
And everything
Come back to me
Come back to me

[Chorus]:
I'll fight for it
I swear I'll never lose the passion
When I'm down
Can I call out your name?
I swear I'll never lose the passion
When I'm down
Can I call out your name?

[Outro]:
When I'm down
Can I call out your name?

[Kayne West:]

Stop it, stop it. Hey radio, fuck you! Radio, fuck you! Y’all don’t want to lose again. A lot of people here tonight felt like they lost. You know why? Because y’all been lied to. Google lied to you. Facebook lied to you. Radio lied to you. Radio, fuck you! I know it’s a lot of real niggas working at radio, real people, real programming directors with wives and kids that love music, that can’t play what they want to play because they’ve been paid to play that bullshit over and over and over. And when I say that bullshit, what I’m saying is: we love Drake, Drake is great. He’s a great artist. But Frank Ocean is great, too! But you know who the greatest of all of us? Who do y’all think?

[crowd shouts “Kanye” and other names]

Nope. Kid motherfucking Cudi.

Radio, fuck you! Oh yeah, I’m on my Trump shit tonight. Radio, fuck you. Yeah, I’m taking his lead. I’ma just say how I say, be ‘Ye, and win. I’ma take his lead. Radio, fuck you! Radio, fuck you! Wait a second. Aye, is it, “'Radio, fuck you?' That’s what you’re saying?” Exactly.

Not fuck the people that work at radio because these is real people that gotta feed they kids and they’re not being allowed to play that real shit because they think that in order to feed they kids they gotta play the same shit over and over and over. I was raised by KRS 1, I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was raised by DMX. The last real nigga alive? Naw, nigga! We real niggas alive, we alive tonight, bruh! We alive tonight, bruh! Virgil Abloh is alive tonight, bro! A$AP Nast is alive tonight, bro! Bari is alive tonight, bro! Ian Connor is alive tonight, bro! Rocky alive tonight, bro! Aye, y’all love my show. When I say these names, y’all better scream for me. I don’t give a fuck if you know the names or not! Go ahead, Google them. They will give you a little bit of factual information. They will give you that. Why did I name A$AP? Because that’s the future. That’s the niggas, they got me and Cudi. It’s life.

We’ve got a hundred years out here, a hundred years on this planet, bro, and we can have a utopia! We can love each other! But the rules gotta be fair. Khaled and Drake and radio and Doc and 92.3 and everybody; is it just me, or did you hear that song so many times “you say you wanna play for free?” Aye, aye! You know what it is, though? Because, aye, I love Drake, I love Khaled. But they set that song up, bro!

And let me tell you something: MTV, fuck you! Once again, as always! I’m on my Trump shit tonight! Let me tell you what it is, bruh. Aye, you know me. I went down seven years of my life of motherfuckers hating me for saying Beyoncé had the best video. Hey, baby, let’s rock and roll tonight. Y’all might be experiencing a lot of pop shit, but the vibes is back! The prodigal son, Kid Cudi, has returned! The vibes is back! I know it’s going to be a lot of conversations after tonight!

Khaled, I know you got hitters from Miami. Please do not send them at my head. I just want to have a conversation about how we playing radio’s game. Khaled, you a real nigga. Khaled, you a real nigga! You got the keys! But, as we learn all the politics that niggas was doing for years, Obama couldn’t make America great because he couldn’t be him to be who he was. Black men have been slaves. Obama wasn’t allowed to do this - AAAH! - and still win! He had to be perfect. But being perfect don’t always change shit, bro. Being perfect don’t always change shit, bro!

So, when I talk about MTV, let me explain something: I was hurt. Beyoncé, I was hurt because I wanted to present a video called “Fade” and I don’t expect MTV to help me. 'Mr. West, I don’t respect you. I will let you know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”' They told me beforehand so I wouldn’t run on stage. Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but you know I got the vision and you know I’ma gonna keep it real with you. Beyoncé, I was hurt! I went down seven years on behalf of your —hey, nigga, don’t throw no shit while I’m talking! I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I talk to y’all like this! This is a moment in the matrix, bro! The vibes is back! The vibes is back! Motherfuckers might feel a way about this tonight.

Beyoncé, I was hurt because I heard that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the Year over me and over "Hotline Bling." In my opinion — now, don’t go trying to diss Beyoncé. She is great, Taylor Swift is great. We are all great people. We are all equal!
But sometimes, we be playing the politics too much and forget who we are just to win. Fuck winning. Fuck looking cool. Fuck looking cool. Fuck being cool. Fuck all that, bruh! I’ve been sitting here to give y’all my truth even at the risk of my own life. Even at the risk of my own success, my own career. I’ve been sitting here to give y’all the truth.

Jay Z, call me, bruh! You still ain’t calling me! Jay Z, call me! Aye, bruh, I know you got killers, please don’t send them at my head! Just call me! Talk to me like a man! I’m not trying to be the man, I just am a man, the same as anybody here! I ain’t above, below none of y’all. We all equal! We all equal! This is the vibes, bro! This is the future. This is the way of thinking to make America great again! Haha, you didn’t like that! Guess what? Y’all need the vibes! I was hurt. Feelings matter, bro! The way motherfuckers put money up so high, popularity, radio spins. Feelings matter, bro. Feelings matter, bro.

It’s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a new world! Feelings matter! Because guess what? Everybody in middle America felt a way and they showed you how they felt. Feelings matter, bro. It’s a new world. It’s a new world, Barack! It’s a new world, Jay Z! Hey, don’t send killers at my head, bro! This ain’t the Malcolm X movie. We growing from that moment. Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye. And wait a second, do y’all agree with that? Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye! Wait a second, I ain’t hear enough screams on that. Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye!

People, I’m not saying this out of my own well-being because it wouldn’t be smart out of my own well-being to say things like this. Radio, I done talked to you a bunch of motherfucking times. Y’all motherfuckers is behind the times! Because guess what? The Saint Pablo Tour is the most relevant shit happening! The Saint Pablo Tour is more relevant than radio! And if y’all keep following old models, your ass is going to be Hillary Clinton! You might not like it, but they gotta hear it. I ain’t here to massage you with a fake truth, telling you that Hillary gon’ win over and over and over and then you wake up, you still can’t believe it! You know why? Because you was lied to by Google. You was lied to by Mark Zuckerberg!

Mark Zuckerberg, you wanna call me now?! Do I got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg?! Was you wrong? When I said I was $53 million in debt and you didn’t call me, was you wrong? You ate dinner, you asked my friend Ebony Schiller to have dinner with me. I told you about DONDA. You said you would help and you didn’t! Then you went to look for aliens. Me and Kid Cudi are aliens right here, bro! The vibes is back!

[to DJ] Aye, John, take it all the way back to the beginning.

Shia LaBeouf, Kid Cudi feels a way. Give him a call.

Q-Tip, I love you, bro. Don’t tell me how to be me, though. I love you. The Tribe album is dope. I love you. Don’t tell me how to be me, though. I’ve been me, I am me. There’s a Richard Pryor interview that you can watch about people coming into power and not changing everything and just becoming a part of the power. That’s happened with musicians because they’re scared. I’m not scared! I’m here to change things! I am here to change things. And things won’t change until people admit their own falsehoods. I got the visions, bro. That’s what I’ve been blessed with. My vision! I’m not always going to say things the perfect way, the right way. But I’m going to say how I feel. Right now, press, get ready to write your passive-aggressive, LeBron James, racist comments. Season 4, racist comments. Get ready to have a field day, press! Get ready, get ready! Because the show’s over.

I know it's gon' be a lotta conversation after tonight. Khaled, I love you, I know you got killers in Miami, please do not send 'em at my head, I just wanna have a conversation about how you playing radio's game. Khaled, you a real nigga. Khaled, you a real nigga, you got the keys. But as we learn all the politics, and niggas was doing for years, Obama couldn't make America great, because he couldn't be him, to be who he was.
Black men have been slaves, Obama wasn't allowed to do this, *screech*, and still win. He had to be perfect, but being perfect don't always change shit bro. Being perfect don't always change shit bro.
So when I'm talking about MTV -- Let me explain something. I was hurt. Beyonce, I was hurt because I wanted to present a video called "Famous", and out of respect, MTV told me "Mr. West, I don't respect you. I will let you know that Beyonce is winning the video tonight, for formation, over Hotline Bling and Famous." They told me beforehand so I wouldn't run on stage. Ay bruh, y'all ain't gotta fuck with me, but you know I got the vision, and you know I'mma keep it real with you.
Beyonce, I was hurt, I went down 7 years on behalf of yo --
Ay nigga, don't throw no shit when I'm talkin'!
I am putting my career, my life, my public well standing, at risk when I talk to y'all like this. This is the moment in the Matrix, bro, the 

[?] is back! The 

[?] is back!
Motherfuckers might feel a way about this tonight. Beyonce, I was hurt, 'cause I heard that you said you wouldn't perform unless you won Video Of The Year over ME, and over Hotline Bling.  In my opinion -- Now don't go trying to diss Beyonce. She is great. Taylor Swift is great. We are all great people. We are all equal. But sometimes, we be playing the politics too much, and forgetting who we are, just to win. Fuck winning. Fuck looking cool. Fuck looking cool. Fuck being cool. Fuck all that, bruh!

This is the way of thinking to Make America Great Again. Hahaha, ayo, you like that. Guess what? Guess what? Y'all need the vibes. I was hurt, feelings matter.

Radio, I done talked to you a bunch of motherfucking times. Y'all motherfuckers is behind the times. Because guess what? The Saint Pablo tour is the most relevant shit happening.

[Verse 1]
My heart is beating fast, my hands won't stop shaking
I thought that we would last, I thought that we would make it
I guess I was wrong all along
We were inseparable but apart we've grown

[Chorus]
So, can you tell me what to do when all the feelings is gone?
When you look around, you're all alone 'cause all the right went wrong
Tell me how you look into my face and say, "Baby, I can't stay"
What do you do when the love just fades away?

[Verse 2]
The situation's ugly, I miss the way you touch me
Do you even want me anymore? Let me know
'Cause I'm tryna to figure us out, I don't wanna break up
What's the use when there ain't nothing left?

[Chorus]
So, can you tell me what to do when all the feelings is gone?
When you look around, you're all alone 'cause all the right went wrong
Tell me how you look into my face and say, "Baby, I can't stay"
What do you do when the love just fades away?

[Bridge]
Was this ever true? Did I ever love you?
Baby, we were caught up in the feeling, girl
Did you ever care for me 'cause if so then where'd it go?
Are we giving up? I need to know or are we holding on?

[Chorus]
Can you tell me what to do when all the feelings is gone?
When you look around, you're all alone 'cause all the right went wrong
Tell me how you look into my face and say, "Baby, I can't stay"
What do you do when the love just fades away?
Can you tell me what to do when all the feelings is gone?
When you look around, you're all alone 'cause all the right went wrong
Tell me how you look into my face and say, "Baby, I can't stay"
What do you do when the love just fades away?
Can you tell me what to do when all the feelings is gone?
When you look around, you're all alone 'cause all the right went wrong
Tell me how you look into my face and say, "Baby, I can't stay"
What do you do when the love just fades away?

Lights off, dress gone, nibble on my neck bone
Sayin' that she love me while she scratchin' with her press ons

[Intro: Pitbull (Steven A. Clark)]
Ape Drums, Steven Clark, and yours truly
Mr. W.W., haha!
I told you once (Can't Have)
I tell you twice (Can't Have)
The grass looks greener on the other side
Til you get to the other side, haha

[Pre-Hook: Steven A. Clark]
Well you're happy now
And I'm so glad, 'cause you're so rad
But I guess we always want what we can't have
You know the loneliness hurts so bad
And girl I want you back
But I guess we always want what we can't have

[Hook: Steven A. Clark]
Can't have
Can't have
Can't have
Ohhhhhh!

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I see Central Park from my hotel room
And it's got me thinking
About the crazy things we used to do
For the fame, for the power, for the fortune
Ducked prison, ducked death, I'm fortunate
It was all a dream, now I wake up and live it
Thinking that the sky was the limit
'Til I figured out there's footprints on the moon
Now I'm like get out the way, bitch move

[Bridge: Pitbull]
Papo I'm live, fuck the other side
I'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die
Everyone knows that this chico gon' ride
Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die
I'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die
Everyone knows that this chico gon' ride
Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die
Everyone wants what they can't have right?

[Pre-Hook: Steven A. Clark]
Well you're happy now
And I'm so glad, 'cause you're so rad
But I guess we always want what we can't have
You know the loneliness hurts so bad
And girl I want you back
But I guess we always want what we can't have

[Hook: Steven A. Clark]
Can't have, can't have
Can't have, can't have
Can't have, can't have
Can't have, ohhhhhh!

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Looking at my backyard, now all I see the ocean
Not bad for a kid that grew up with roaches
Drama, chaos, and different cultures
That's what allows me to see through these vultures
First we shined the shoes
Then we own the shoe shop
First we make the sandwich
Then we own the restaurants
First then we clean the house
Then we own every house on the block
Not bad for some immigrants

[Bridge: Pitbull]
Papo I'm live, fuck the other side
I'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die
Everyone knows that this chico gon' ride
Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die
I'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die
Everyone knows that this chico gon' ride
Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die
Everyone wants what they can't have right?

[Pre-Hook: Steven A. Clark]

Can't have, can't have
Can't have, can't have
Can't have, can't have
Can't have, ohhhhhh!

Scenes

[Intro]
The title, "M A N I A", appears in bold, red capital letters.

[1: "All I Know" Scene]
Murphy the leopard is in the center of an arena-like area. A white light is flashing to the beat of the song. Murphy glares up as saliva dribbles from his mouth.

[2: "Sidewalks" Scene]
Abel is seen riding in his McLaren P1, singing along to the song. There is a slow motion clip of Murphy running. Abel continues singing along to "Sidewalks" in his expensive vehicle. Cut to a view of a mountain in the distance.

[3: "Secrets" Scene]
There is ambience in the background. Abel, wearing a blue baseball cap, gets out of his P1. He walks into the nightclub. "Secrets" begins to play and Abel sings along. Everybody in the club is dancing. There is a young woman dancing seductively in the middle and Abel has his eye on her.

[4: "Die For You" Scene]
Under a fading blue light, Abel and the woman from the previous scene are becoming extremely close and dancing slowly and romantically with one another. A man is watching them from a distance with jealousy. The music fades and Abel is seen in the bathroom using water to make sure his hair looks perfect for his newly found woman of interest. The jealous man walks up to him from behind as he washes his face in the sink. He then lunges for Abel with his knife and blood spurts everywhere. The music stops and Murphy roars.

[5: "Party Monster" Scene]
Abel is covered in blood. The man lays dead on the floor, still bleeding. The woman from earlier is stood above his body in an all-black outfit. She presumably saved Abel from being knifed. The scene cuts to the nightclub and Abel, who still has a trail of blood on the side of his face, is dancing with his woman and mouthing along the lyrics to the song  as it plays in the background. Cut to flashing blue lights.

[6: "I Feel It Coming" Outro Scene & Credits]
Abel is singing to the track. Him and his girl are seen stood where Murphy the leopard was sat in the area from the first scene.Songs Appearing In The Visuals1. "All I Know" ft. Future (0:00-0:42)

[Intro]
I can't blame you
I can't save you
But I will try
For you and I
For you and I

[Verse 1]
I won't find out
All the dirty little things that you've done
But I will try

[Pre Chorus]
I'm coming for you giants and you liars
And your chariots of fire
You charmers with your anecdotes
Have started to show your true colors

[Chorus]
Now I’m staring at the moon
Wondering why the bottom fell out
And searching for answers
And it’s questions I found
Open your eyes, and share this burden somehow
Are you ready to drink?
Or are you waiting to drown?

[Post Chorus]
I would break you
Before I let you
Fall into a blind
For you and I
For you and I

[Verse 2]
I will breath in
All the truth I can stomach
If it keeps you alive

[Verse 3]
We've changed the dreamers and the preachers and the wise men on the hill
To concrete stepping smilers
Terrified to lose their power and control

[Pre Chorus 2 - Bridge]
We've been crying for a leader
To speak like the old prophets
The blood of the forgotten wasn't spilled without a purpose
Or was it?

[Chorus]
Now I’m staring at the moon
Wondering why the bottom fell out
And searching for answers
And it’s questions I found
Open you eyes, and share this burden somehow
Are you ready to drink?
Or are you waiting to drown?

[Outro]
You'll never be whole
You'll never be whole
Until you lose control
And think freely to smash the wall of apathy
Stop your self-importance and lift the weight off somebody else

You'll never be whole
You'll never be whole
Until you lose control
And stop drinking the wine, that's been dripping
From lips of the gluttons and envying their bloody teeth

And you'll never be whole
You'll never be whole
Until you lose control

[Chorus]
When your best friend's all strung out
You do everything you can cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
And you find it all around
It comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start

[Verse 1]
Feelings, sleeping in the field again
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel it's beginning to end
Yeah, premonitions smiling in the dark
Well I can see, I can see, I can see the story's starting to arc

Ohhh ohhhh ohhhh ohhhhh

[Pre Chorus 1]
It dries up
I've been a smoking word, I've been a river bed, I've been a rabid force
And let it flow out from within
Sometimes it feels like I only dream in black and white
And color's so oh

[Chorus]
When your best friend's all strung out
You do everything you can cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
And you find it all around
Well, you say it's what you need and hide your eyes when you're close to me
With your feet up in the clouds
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start

[Verse 2]
Waits, and fed us slipping into dreams
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel, the celestial beings
Welted pleasures leave you with a breath
I can see, I can see, I can see, the beauty in the mask

Ohhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhh

[Pre Chorus 2]
It draws up
I've been a river bed, I tried to salt my wound
I carried more than I can
I feel I got a lot to prove
Sometimes I feel I only dream in black and white
But color's so oh

[Chorus]
When your best friend's all strung out
You do everything you can cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
And you find it all around
Well, you say it's what you need and hide your eyes when you're close to me
With your feet up in the clouds
Well, you oughta know, that I'm here no matter where you wanna go
When you're hanging upside down
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start

[Bridge]
I'm here
No matter where you are
I'm waiting here
Open up, no matter where you are
Sometimes you have to wait
It passes by like a satellite, a star
No matter where you are

[Refrain]
When your best friend's all strung out
You know when
Oooooh
Oooooh
When your feet up in the clouds
Oh yeah, you know it
Oooooh
Oooooh
When your best friend's all strung out
Oh yeah, you know it
You oughta know, that I'm here no matter where you wanna go
In your head, hanging upside-down
Oh yeah, you know it
That's how you know when your best friend's all strung out

[Verse 1]
Faded and worn at the seams
A psychotropic wanderlust, sick and laughing
Their words bared their teeth into the wall
I promised I would rid the world of feral animals

I see you smiling with your feet up like your heroes
You'd off yourself to save your reputation
Strong and fearless and deprived just like your heroes
Are you sharpening your sword?
Well, you'll fade out anyway

[Chorus]
Why'd you say
Why'd you say that you'd come right back for my love, for my faith?
All the promises you made never realized
Why'd you say
Why'd you say that you'd come right back for my love, for my strength?
All the promises you made never realized

[Verse 2]
Fill the air with what you like
Another weekend massacre of opinion
Don't be afraid of the knife
Sometimes you have to cut the limb to survive
I see you smiling with your feet up like your heroes
You'd off yourself to save your reputation
Strong and fearless and deprived just like your heroes
Are you sharpening your sword?
Well, you'll bleed out anyway

[Chorus]
Why'd you say
Why'd you say that you'd come right back for my love, for my faith?
All the promises you made never realized
Why'd you say
Why'd you say that you'd come right back for my love, for my strength?
All the promises you made never realized

You got to love the madness of the feeling
Don't have to rush the freshness of beginning
You've got to get back up and face your demons
Don't ever be afraid of starting over

[Verse 1]
Well I see you standing there like a rabid dog
And you got those crying eyes
Makes me want to surrender and wrap you in my arms
You know I try to live without regrets
I'm always moving forward and not looking back
But I tend to leave a trail of dead, while I'm moving ahead
So I'm stepping away
Cause I got nothing to say

[Chorus 1]
Feels like, feels like it’s coming
It feels like, feels
It’s like a coming of age
Feels like, feels like it’s coming
It feels like, feels like a coming of age

[Verse 2]
And when my fear pulls me out to sea
And the stars are hidden by my pride and my enemies
I seem to hurt the people that care the most
Just like an animal I protect my pride
When I'm too bruised to fight
And even when I'm wrong I tend to think I'm right

[Bridge]
Well I’m bored of the game
And too tired to rage

[Chorus 2]
Feels like, feels like it’s coming
It feels like, feels
It’s like a coming of age
Feels like, feels like it’s coming
It feels like, feels like a coming of age
And I'm burning the page

[Chorus 1]
Feels like, feels like it’s coming
It feels like, feels
It’s like a coming of age
Feels like, feels like it’s coming
It feels like, feels like a coming of age

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 3]
Feels like, feels like it’s coming
It feels like, feels
It’s like a coming of age
Feels like, feels like it’s coming
It feels like, feels like a coming
Feels like, feels like it’s coming of age
Feels like, feels like it’s coming
Feels like, feels like it’s coming
Uuuuh uuuuh

[Verse 1]
I've been trying to re-learn my name
It seems like a thousand years
I've been out of frame
And I surrender the truth is what
It's what I've needed from you
Cause I've been floating within your walls of opinion
And I'm tired - I only want the truth

[Chorus]
I have tried so hard not to be like them
I have found they don't ever say what they mean
There is a truth, there is a light if you'd follow me there
I've been searching for the directions and
I'm convinced the world doesn't know what it needs
There is a hope for the hopeless, I can promise you that

[Verse 2]
Yeah, well I've been accosted
The jury's been partial
But I won't surrender
To prove to you I won't lie
Under pressure of compromise
Yeah well an absolute measure won't change with opinion
No matter how hard you try
It's an immovable thing
Just like the visions in your bed
Or when they're streaming in your head

[Chorus]
I have tried so hard not to be like them
I have found they don't ever say what they mean
There is a truth, there is a light if you'd follow me there
I've been searching for the directions and
I'm convinced the world doesn't know what it needs
There is a hope

[Post Chorus]
I'll come back
If you're leading my hand
The world is so broken
I'm tripping my steps
I'm slipping and I know why
I never thought that I'd be here
A blinding call to prayer
Has touched my feet
Like the call of the prophets
A purpose is needed before you know that you know
To never wonder what you are
And not forget where you come from

[Bridge]
Yeah, oooh, mmm
Is it really love you've been speaking of?
Oh, What'd you say? What'd you say?
What'd you say? What'd you say?
I said that you need me, Don't you?

[Chorus]
There is a truth, I can promise you that
I have tried so hard not to be like them
I have found they don't ever say what they mean

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
The truth, the truth stands in the end
While you're deciding what to do
The truth stands in the end
While you're deciding what to do

[Verse 1]
Promise I'm not cocky, I just know I can fuck you right
Give me the time of day, babe
And I'm gon' make it last all night with you
Yeah, that's all I wanna do, aw yeah

[Bridge]
Baby, I don't know what you put on, no
Girl, I'm gonna take it off, go, so you might as well come naked

[Verse 2]
Showed up naked, I ain't playin', girl, I'm with this shit
Answer the door, say hello and then put my face in it
Drop to your knees just like I'm the one you're prayin' with
'Cause you said you can take it, take it off
I wanna see that, put your feet up
Baby, I ain't talkin' relax
Tryna head to the spot, where the G at?
She addicted to the D, every night it's a relapse

[Pre-Chorus]
My baby's coming over
We don't even need no foreplay
Even when we sober
We get drunk off love and then sex all day

[Chorus]
Sip to this, oh I
Let's take a sip to this
Baby, turn up
Sip to this, let's take a sip to this
'Cause then we gon' fuck to this
Oh yeah, you know you love the shit
Baby, turn up

[Verse 3]
Normally I'm patient but I need all of you right now (now)
Please don't keep me waiting
I've been waiting to lay you down (lay you down)
Lay you down, lay you down, right now, oh yeah

[Bridge]
I don't know what you put on
'cause I'm gonna take it off, so you might as well come naked

[Verse 4]
You look better with no clothes on anyway (huh, yeah)
Never let the pride of the panties get up in the way (no)
Pull 'em to the side, let you ride like the interstate (ooh)
'Cause you said you could take it, take it off (you could take it off)
Make it disappear now, like you doing a magic show
And we leaving scratches like animals
I'm off that poison, don't give me no antidote (my bad)

[Pre-Chorus]
My baby's coming over (ooh)
We don't even need no foreplay (no, no, no, woah)
Even when we sober
We get drunk off love and then sex all day (I think we should take a sip to this)

[Chorus]
Sip to this, oh I
Let's take a sip to this (why don't you go and turn up)
Baby, turn up (yeah, yeah)
Sip to this, let's take a sip to this (yeah, come on)
'Cause then we gon' fuck to this (oh babe, oh babe, oh yeah, you)
Oh yeah, you know you love the shit
So, baby, turn up

[Outro]
Sip to this (uh-huh)
I just want to kiss on you (uh-huh, ooh)
Wanna put my lips on you (uh-huh)
Baby, you know how we do
Baby, turn up (yeah)
Sip to this, sippin' (huh)
We be sippin', let's take a sip to this
Sippin', sippin' (yeah, huh)

[Verse 1]
Hell
Holy hell, holy hell
Damn, the future ain't looking so bright
Never asked for a paradise
But seventy years would be nice
With my brothers and sisters and I
And the impossible dream of mankind
But I've always been the irrational type

[Verse 2]
Hell
What the hell, what the hell
This thing's got us all in its grip
The economy just don't explain this
This unfathomable, nameless rift
Who knows if it even exists
It's just some highly effective rhetoric
Used by perverts who get off on it

[Outro]
But all my friends
Yeah, I'm talking to you
The world won't end unless we want it to
There's no one in control
And it's our life to choose

[Intro]

Stunting feed the appetite, say the price
Paper tight, blow it like some candle light

I’m about to waste, don’t trip, like back in the day like 2 legit
Where the love go, to my dub show
We’re on the sexy ghetto, where’d your new patron get us

[Hook: Akon]
When I’m in the club Imma need me a few of the things that the bar can’t bring
First it’s money, second its me in the VIP full of guarantees
You gotta be down if I’m gonna spend amends on you
You gotta be down if I’m gonna spend amends on you
She gotta be down, gotta love, that's me
She gotta be down, for sure guarantee

[Lucidious: Verse 1]

Yeah
Can I ever really find a way to let go of you
I been thinking about it every time that I'm in a booth
Try to put together everything that we do
Every step we take is away from the truth

What's the point of a relationship
If every other day we gotta save that shit
It’s gotta be love, thought we found it
Ship has been sinking we both have been drowning

All the hatred that we been allowing
All the alcohol that we been downing
Afraid to commit but afraid to let go I'm alone I can feel all the demons surrounding

Been a while since I recognized
Who I see when I look in my eyes
Trying to breathe but the more that I try
More that I suffocate dying inside
Tried to be different we both tried to listen I'm sorry that I had to leave you behind
All of the bitching was causing division I had to let go I was losing my mind

Locked in a prison got lost in the vision of somehow believing that we would be fine
Made the decision to leave this position and put all my pain in the faith of divine (faith of divine, faith of divine)

[Pre-Hook]

All we can take is one day at a time
Be patient and open to seeing the signs
Love is a war that you might not survive

Happiness is what I hope you will find when you feeling the vibe and you meet the right guy
Thought it was me, but it wasn't our time
Still I’ll love you till the day that I die (day that I die, day that I die)

[Xavier Frye: HOOK]

Took it too fast but we were taking it slow
Hang on tight or we can let it go
We can surrender and just move on
We can be stubborn because we are strong

We can pretend that what we both know ain’t true
I don’t mind it and neither do you
Nothing to gain just something to prove
We can try this love again or face the truth

[Lucidious: Verse 2]

I wish I could stay here to be your protection
Loving myself is what I been neglecting
The most difficult part is the patience
While taking in all of these changes

I don't mean to be acting evasive
I'm pretending I don't wanna face this
I get sick to my stomach when I think about someone else touching you now I'm anxious

All I got left is a picture of us
All because we had broken the trust
Been working on gaining it back for a year, but the spark has been missing it turned into dust

Miss the high that I got from your touch
Both of us felt an adrenaline rush
Co-dependent treated you like a crutch
My heart was stolen & brutally crushed

Question is will I ever know
What we we could have been if I let you go
If I need to walk this path alone
All on my own cause I need to grow

Fuck, I'm sick of this
Feeling like a mother fucking hypocrite
Made a lot of mistakes I gotta live with it
Find a way to let it go and be indifferent
Quit talking (quit talking, quit talking)

[Pre-Hook]

All we can take is one day at a time
Be patient and open to seeing the signs
Love is a war that you might not survive

Happiness is what I hope you will find when you feeling the vibe and you meet the right guy
Thought it was me, but it wasn't our time
Still I’ll love you till the day that I die (day that I die, day that I die)

[Xavier Frye: HOOK]

Took it too fast but we were taking it slow
Hang on tight or we can let it go
We can surrender and just move on
We can be stubborn because we are strong

We can pretend that what we both know ain’t true
I don’t mind it and neither do you
Nothing to gain just something to prove
We can try this love again or face the truth

[Verse 1]
It was dawn and I
Waited on the filter
So to typify
Said she called me mister
Under misty skies
Hit to get there quicker
Rebel through the night
'Cuz I truly missed her
Universal charm
'Cuz she thinks it’s humour
And I mean no harm
Lie down into this
Fall back she says
Let’s just keep this mutual
It’s these lines I dread
Too much life force simple

[Chorus]
Midnight mischief strolling through my mind
Caught you there but I left you behind
Midnight mischief strolling through my mind
It’s my midnight mischief time

[Verse 2]
As the night awaits
I can see her sleeping
Stare down mistake
Does she know my secret?
I’m in love with her
Let the love manifest
Watch me take my serve
Does she know I’m master
Watch me take control
She doesn’t know what hit her
Glimpses of her soul
As a seamless dinner
Numbers on the plate
It’s my turn now
One minute to the hour

[Chorus]
Midnight mischief strolling through my mind
Caught you there but I left you behind
Midnight mischief strolling through my mind
It’s my midnight mischief time

[Verse 3]
Come back home to the place I like when it’s over
I’ve been waiting all day
Never seem to hold myself and notice
It’s a dangerous place (I'll wait for days)
Used to care but I can see your holding (I'll wait for days)
For a better place
Midnight mischief (I'll wait for days)
Creeping through the curtain

[Bridge]
Midnight flow press rewind, my minds melody shows that tonight
Midnight flow press rewind, my minds melody shows that tonight
I’ll wait all day for you, I’ll wait for you

[Outro]
See I can’t blame myself, I got the right of way
Midnight call me alright, my lover you take control
And I can’t blame myself, I have the right of way
Midnight call me alright, my lover you take control
See I can’t blame myself, I got the right of way
Midnight call me alright, my lover you take control

[Ad-Libs]

[Verse]
B.o.B, uno is my numeral
They said that hip-hop was dead, I must have missed the funeral
But see what happened was they started assuming stuff
'Cause I ain't think the bible's gon' get here soon enough
I like thick hoes that like to get their botty rubbed
So when I am in a room with her that's what I do to her
I send her ass to Jupiter, stretch her uterus
And when I'm through with her, man I put my boot in her (oh!)
Ha, see y'all can miss me with that silly shit
I'm finna ride for my hood, I ain't Benedick
I go extra extra hard, I ain't finna quit
I'm in this thang for the bread, I ain't into friends
And yeah I spit it off the brain, I ain't in the pants
And no I can't pretend my nigga, I'm genuine
Okay, so let me tell you what I'm interested in
Big fat ass buds of kush and your twins
Honey put it on the stove
Where she's pacing to and fro
Steaming up
As the kettle overflows
Lets her know
That it's time to pour it out
Steaming up
Gently now and sip it down
(Steaming up and sip it down)

Sally did my nankhatai
Frozen in a moment's time
Sitting still, holding one another's life
Out of sight
So we keep each other safe
Hope to see
Everybody do the same
(Please be good and please be safe)

[Verse 1]
Well let's take off from the start
I know you've tried all this before
And did your best to fight the war and break it off
But if I follow my name
I will calm you in the storm
And breathe you in when you are worn, be still my love
Would it take a shooting star?
To show you life could bloom when something breaks
And when the the pieces fall I'll catch them all

[Chorus]
Nevermind what you're looking for
You'll always find what you're looking for
Sometimes it's blinding in the race
But I'll be here smiling when I see your face
Nevermind what you're looking for
You're gonna find what you're looking for
Sometimes it's blinding in the race
But I will be here smiling when I see your face

[Verse 2]
Yeah it's hard to know the truth
In this post-modernist view
Where absolutes are seen as relics
And laughed out of the room
And I'm scared to say your name
I've cried wolf so many times, cause I'm afraid of what you'd want from me
And will you find me through the grey?
My mind's a minefield of the wretched
It's honestly deceptive

[Chorus]
Nevermind what you're looking for
You'll always find what you're looking for
Sometimes it's blinding in the race
But I'll be here smiling when I see your face
Nevermind what you're looking for
You're gonna find what you're looking for
Sometimes it's blinding in the race
But I will be here smiling when I see your face

[Bridge]
Aaaah...
Aaaah...
Aaaah...
Aaaah...

[Outro]
Nevermind what you're looking for
You'll always find what you're looking for

[Voiceover]
(We have a very absorbing story of a girl who was forced into a game of terror. In which the dice were loaded with--)

No one knew if her face was black and blue when she hit the water
But it was when they dragged her out
Are the rumors true, did you see those empty bottles
They had come to see what the fuss was all about

And every cop in town was her audience that night
They had come from all around, they heard she was famous
But you'd never know, except her hair was perfect
And everyone kind of felt like movie stars and they went home so impressed

By Natalie Wood
(Natalie Wood)
I'll see you in my dreams
Natalie Wood
(Natalie Wood)
Marlon Brando, and Steve McQueen

Cut to the scene, she turned seventeen
And do you still believe everything that your mother told ya?
'Cause when you're born into this life, reciting lines is a waste of time
Just go in there and close the door behind ya
And there's a world of difference between acing the audition
And doing whatever it takes to win the part
And all those other girls, well they just had to listen
They knew it took more than kissing if you want to break somebody's heart
Like Natalie Wood
(Natalie Wood)
I'll see you in my dreams
Natalie Wood
(Natalie Wood)
Marlon Brando, and Steve McQueen

Doesn't matter who they're pointing at
'Cause the cameras always shine on you
Fifteen when you cut your pigtail
Washed up at twenty-two

Like Natalie Wood
I'll see you in my dreams
Natalie Wood
Dennis Hopper, James Dean

I'll see you in my dreams

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
How did this all come back around?
Left for dead when I hit the ground
After everything, now I've found
That you set me up just to knock me down

Here and now is where this begins
I don't know what your sickness is
But I do know what the difference is
Just show that face for your witnesses

Just talk and talk and talk and lie
With every little word, you rot inside
You're not really gonna stop and try
To make right of the wrong you caught me by

So, I know what's happening
I see that web you trapping in
You can kid yourself now, all you want
I'm not falling for that, again

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
To sha na ba ba ba ba ba na na no
Lo ba na na ba ba ba ba na na no
To sha na ba ba ba ba ba na na no
Lo ba na na ba ba ba ba na na no
Shi ga na ba na na no
Shi ga na ba na na no

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Forget about all that who and when
The hurt you knew that drew me in
The dirt you rubbed my bruises in
The guilt that I felt when the rules were bent

This is where the brand new begins
This is where the confusion ends
I don't care if I lose or win
I just know that I don't want to pretend

Just talk and talk and laugh and grin
Here we go, just like that again
Back to get stabbed in the back again
Like the last time was just practicing

This time, here's what's happening
I see that web you trapping in
You can kid yourself now, all you want
I'm not falling for that, again

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
To sha na ba ba ba ba ba na na no
Lo ba na na ba ba ba ba na na no
To sha na ba ba ba ba ba na na no
Lo ba na na ba ba ba ba na na no
Shi ga na ba na na no
Shi ga na ba na na no

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
This time, here's what's happening
I see that web you trapping in (Ga na ba)
Kid yourself now, all you want
I'm not falling for that, again (Ga na ba)

This time, here's what's happening
I see that web you trapping in (Ga na ba)
Kid yourself now, all you want
I'm not falling for that, again
We started it off

I ask you what your heart desires
My love, my love
You tell me I'm the only one
My love, my love

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a lie, a lie
I catch you every time
In your lies, your lies
Every time you close your eyes

[Chorus]
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'

[Verse 2]

[Intro]
Stand behind the yellow tape
Stand behind the yellow tape
Stand behind the yellow tape
(Yeah) Stand behind the yellow tape

[Verse 1]
Wait a second, wait a minute
Don't compare me to them other niggas
Desert Eagle, Smith & Wesson
I'm 'bout to go to war, gon' pledge allegiance
Where the real friends at when you really need 'em?
When I was locked up in the county, I ain't even see 'em
All by my lonely, lonely
What happen to the bitches and the party?
A hundred bottles, that was every weekend
Bitches piled up in my crib like a coliseum
After 3 A.M., you know we gettin' freaky
Hella one-night stands, bitches catchin' feelings
Tired of fake lovin'
Fake Hollywood, ain't 'bout shit
Fake gang bangin' and claimin' to pop shit
Fake titties and cocaine in they nostrils, stop it (Hah)

[Verse 2]
Soo Woo, been a nigga, been about it
And if it's my time to go, I'm takin' everybody
Don't care, my niggas, we shootin' anybody
And if it ain't yo' business, nigga, don't worry about it, oh
I hear 'em talkin' down on me, down on me
Well, where they at tonight? Got a hundred rounds on me
I think I had it up to here, my nigga (Hah)
You know your killers, they fear my niggas (Hah)
So what you tryna, tryna do, tryna, tryna do?
Dancin' ‘round the issue, bitch, you know you runnin' out of moves
I keep it real, my nigga (Hah)
This Richard Mille hella clear, cost a mil, my nigga (Yeah)
Give a fuck about how you feel, my nigga
Got the mic, life a horror movie, feel like Thriller
Passive-aggressive bitches always actin' all timid
Won't help you make no money but I bet they help you spend it (Hah)

[Refrain]
Had a meeting with the Devil last week
Couldn't believe what he said to me (Hah)
"Here take this contract, signature, please
You can have it all but you know your soul, I'ma keep"
Bad luck, bad luck, yeah, you know it come in threes
Battlin' my demons I'm the only one to see (Hah)
I got the fire blazin' burnin' all the weed
I bet that Hell ain't hotter than this fuckin' Hennessy, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Two feet off the ground, woah, woah, like why am I livin' here?
Up and down, up and down, woah, woah, I think I might drown from my tears
I cry 'cause my fate is sold, too many tears, I'm thinking 'bout ending here
Want to forget, Russian roulette with the pistol

[Chorus]
Bang, bang, bang, yeah, that's all it take
Wahyo, wahyo, wahyo, wahyo, stand behind the yellow tape (Ayy)
Bang, bang, bang, bang, yeah, that's all it take
Wahyo, wahyo, wahyo, wahyo, stand behind the yellow tape (Hey)
Bang, bang, bang, bang, yeah, that's all it take
Don't shoot, don't shoot, stand behind the yellow tape
Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot
Stand behind the yellow tape

[Verse 3]
Wonder if God got a sense of humor
I hope you know that He see all that shit you doin'
Know I'm a sinner but I hope that He still listen to me
Temptation and fornication, He know I love the pussy
Misdirection with no connection, ain't no substance
She just want to fuck, whatever happened to us love makin'?
You don't want to be in the club when you a old lady
And I know that I'm too fucked up to love my own lady
Ain't gon' lie, every nigga cheat, frontin' like they poppin' bottles
All these niggas cheap, me? I'm standin' on my wallet
It don't mean I ain't lonely
In the Hills, all the way up, UberX sittin' at the bottom
You know I ain't gotta flex, nigga, know I got it
Chain cost a quarter mil, for me, that's a couple dollars
Sayin', "Fuck it", takin' pornstars to Benihanas
What's the point at rockin', rollin' without the gunpowder?

[Refrain]
Had a meeting with the Devil last week
Couldn't believe what he said to me (Hah)
"Here take this contract, signature, please
You can have it all but you know your soul, I'ma keep"
Bad luck, bad luck, yeah, you know it come in threes
Battlin' my demons I'm the only one to see (Hah)
I got the fire blazin' burnin' all the weed
I bet that Hell ain't hotter than this fuckin' Hennessy, yeah

Two feet off the ground, woah, woah, like why am I livin' here?
Up and down, up and down, woah, woah, I think I might drown from my tears
I cry 'cause my fate is sold, too many tears, I'm thinkin' 'bout endin' here
Want to forget, Russian roulette with the pistol

[Chorus]
Bang, bang, bang, yeah, that's all it take
Wahyo, wahyo, wahyo, wahyo, stand behind the yellow tape (Ayy)
Bang, bang, bang, bang, yeah, that's all it take
Wahyo, wahyo, wahyo, wahyo, stand behind the yellow tape (Hey)
Bang, bang, bang, bang, yeah, that's all it take
Don't shoot, don't shoot, stand behind the yellow tape
Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot
Stand behind the yellow tape

[Sample: "Good Taste Tip: Dating Courtesy" by The Shangri-Las]
(Dating Courtesy: A girl is right to assume her date will perform little acts of courtesy which are his privilege. If you are smart, you will allow him to open doors and hold chairs. Don't barge on ahead like a baby elephant. You'll get attention all right, but it won't be favorable. It is correct to pause and let him know you expect him to act like a gentleman. He'll love it and think you're a lady, and in return it will flatter his masculine ego.)

(For you)
(I wonder if)

Excuse me for a second
While I bang my head against this wall
And I'm starting to suspect
You don't intend to do what you say at all
Forgive your loyal sycophant
For leaving lipstick stains upon your shoes

And I wasted all my favorite melodies (for you)
And watched best friends turn to enemies (for you)
You heard I like the bad girls baby
Maybe that's true
For everybody else except (for you)

Excuse me miss, but isn't this
Your naked body in my bed?
And how come it always felt like
You were taking something away
When you were giving head?
And it's a promise and a threat to say the "F" word
So be careful who you screw
And I used up all this latent energy (for you)
Tell me was everything you ever said to me just (for you)
Still thinking there was something in a girl's underwear
That could change me
Like I was still in middle school
Like a fool (for you)

Lonesome poets throwing glitter in their hair
Doing somersaults and exploding in mid-air
But you don't ever notice or you don't care
Or both
And when they take off all their clothes
Were they still not close enough? (for you)

[Verse 1]
It has begun again, my friend
In this room, we are nothing but strangers in a bed
You made me fall again, my friend
How can I forget when you said love was just pretend?

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I told her I've been thinkin' 'bout her lately
But she told me that to love her is so crazy (Hey)

[Chorus]
'Cause she loves to lay (Woah)
I learned the hard way (Oh)
She loves to lay, I'm all to blame
I learned the hard way (Oh)
She loves to lay
Know I learned the hard way
She loves to lay, it's all a game
I learned the hard way (Hey)

[Verse 2]
It has begun again, my friend (My friend)
In your heart, we are (We are) nothing but strangers in the end

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I told her I've been thinkin' 'bout her lately
But she told me that to love her is so crazy (Hey)

[Chorus]
'Cause she loves to lay (Woah)
I learned the hard way (Oh)
She loves to lay, I'm all to blame
I learned the hard way (I learned the hard way; oh)
She loves to lay (Hey)
Know I learned the hard way
She loves to lay, it's all a game
I learned the hard way (Oh)

[Bridge]
I feel there's someone else
Worth your time from the start
He's just one call away
From your mind and your heart
It has begun (Begin) again (Again), my friend (Hey)

[Chorus]
She loves to lay (She loves to lay; woah)
I learned the hard way (Know I learned the hard way; oh)
She loves to lay, I'm all to blame
I learned the hard way (Woah, woah; oh)
She loves to lay
Know I learned the hard way
She loves to lay, it's all a game
I learned the hard way (Ho)

[Intro]
An igloo full of snow and a white stove
House full of naked hoes snortin' blow
It's so lonely at the top, plus its real cold
A house full of hoes and they cookin' blow
I'm in Zone Six aka the North Pole
Burr! EA, GA
1-0-1-7, Wop, six

[Verse]
Middle of the winter I pull up in a vert
It's the middle of December she pulled up in a skirt
Santa Claus of the hood
I pull up with the work
They call me East Atlanta Santa
Run up on me get murked
I'm just trappin' through the snow
Sellin' nine half a bricks in four ways
Over the hills we go
Got an extendo and an AK (gra, gra, gra)
I'm a neighborhood philanthropist
I'm sellin' bales of cannabis
Preachin' like an evangelist
But I don't fuck with amateurs
I drive spiders, yeah, tarantulas
My diamonds are immaculate
I'm not on no romantic shit
But I'm cookin' cocaine, candle lit
I'm so trill, your ho can't handle it
But damn, that bitch can suck a dick
Skeeted on her face and lip
Guwop can't fuck no basic bitch
The teacher teachin' arithmetic
Show you how to whip a brick
Learn you how you run your clique
And told you how to kill a snitch
My young girl she a freaky chick
But damn she on that sneaky shit
Ran off with a half a zip
And now I got to slap a trick
All these record labels broke as shit
Ricky Dinky record shit
I sell more meth than a Mexican
My dog food yea its excellent
I done started sellin' Christmas tree
I'm tryna jingle bells ho
Its Christmas time its Hollis, Queens
I'm stompin' in my shell toes
Christmas time in '96
I asked Santa for twelve golds
But now Guwop got gifts to give
But I don't fuck with twelve though

[Outro]
Santa Claus in the city, bag full of goodies
I wish these faggot-ass cops would let a nigga live
I'm tryna come down the chimney with a 100 mil
I'm the Bricksquad boss I'm like Santa Claus

[Refrain]
They starting rumors all about anything
They wanna ruin us and get crazy
They talking reckless then the ones I know

[Chorus]
They wanna, they wanna, they wanna

[Verse 1]
When you’re down, I’m the first to know it
You turn around, then you take aim on me
Scream and shout, I’m not afraid to take it (oh)
We’ve gotta be stronger than pride
We can’t bruise as easily

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey
Won’t you come and sit down next to me
Put your head on my chest, baby breathe
You don’t have to hide your tears from me

[Chorus]
Hey
You know I’m gonna
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
Swear I’ma prove it
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
Dammit, I’ll do it
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
Never gone lose it
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
I know you’ve had it hard
You’ve seen it fall apart
Love is never easy
But, I swear to God
I know I’m gonna
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
Dammit I’ll do it
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)

[Verse 2]
I know I can drive you close to crazy (yeah)
You’ve seen me battle my demons too (oh)
A beautiful life isn’t always pretty (hey)
But I’ll fight for this love as long as I’m fighting with you (hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey
Won’t you come and sit down next to me
Put your head on my chest, baby breathe
I’ll give you a reason to believe

(Chorus)
Hey
You see I’m gonna

Swear I’ma prove it

Dammit, I’ll do it

Dammit I’ll do it

[Bridge]
All this broken glass is the evidence
We’re not innocent, we still make perfect sense
In the aftermath, I’ll be here after that
And after that

[Chorus]
You know I’m gonna
(love you anyway, love you anyway)
Swear I’ma prove it
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
Dammit, I’ll do it
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
Never gone lose it
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
They’ve never seen before
Two hearts that bleed, it’s true
A legendary love, this I swear to you

[Outro]
I know I’m gonna
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)
Dammit, I’ll do it
(Love you anyway, love you anyway)

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Huh, yeah, it's Gucci!
Tiller! Brr, brr-brr!

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Pull up in a Lam', it'll drive you crazy
Had to cut her off cause the bitch too lazy
She wanna ride the wave, but my waves too wavy
And your car too slow, you need to drive Miss Daisy
Jumped out the feds like, "Fuck you, pay me"
Got her foamin' mouth like the bitch got rabies
Got me runnin' out the spot like the spot got raided
'Cause I'm so much different then the nigga you dated
Smilin' in the camera like, "Bitch, I made it"
Big Guwop got the whole club faded
Got a bitch so bad that my ex bitch hate it
Tell me how you feel when you see me skatin'
Nah, you don't call me baby
We ain't finna go to the mall,Ms. Lady
When you leave me feelin' standin' tall, Ms. Lady
Like can you take it, take it, take it all, Ms. Lady?
Never get a love like this
Never ever, ever meet a thug like this
Never met a plug like this
Never seen a nigga in the club like this
Never hug like this
Never pour Ace of Spades in the tub like this
Never got drunk like this
Or beat from the back on the rug like this

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
What? Tell 'em how crazy I drove you
Talk about how crazy you drove me
Talk about them favors you owe me
Talk about them
Talk about them lies you told me
Talk about true colors you showed me
Talk about them, what?
Tell 'em how crazy I drove you
Talk about how crazy you drove me
Talk about them favors you owe me
Talk about them
Talk about them lies you told me
Talk about true colors you showed me
Talk about them

[Verse 2: Bryson Tiller]
Aye, lil' mama say she fuck with me tough, yeah
Lil' mama say she fuck with me tough, yeah
Her ex-boyfriend's words cut deep
Aye, Young Tiller in the cut, yeah
Aye, Young Tiller goin' up, yeah
At your head with that uppercut, yeah
I'm still on the motherfuckin' come up
But y'all already know where I'm from, yeah
Straight from the 502, hey
Southside Dirty, I grew, hey
Now they wanna show my moves, hey
Every little thing that I do and say
My old bitch said she need closure
I just think she wanna get closer
I just think she want some exposure
Tell people how crazy I drove her
Tell people all the dreams I sold her
I'm sorry, you cannot lean on my shoulder
I already got too many burdens
Most of them 'bout to give to my attorney
I got too many niggas in my face now
This ain't the time 'nor place now
This for my niggas that stay down
Fuck all you niggas that wanna hate now

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
What? Tell 'em how crazy I drove you
Talk about how crazy you drove me
Talk about them favors you owe me
Talk about them
Talk about them lies you told me
Talk about true colors you showed me
Talk about them, what?
Tell 'em how crazy I drove you
Talk about how crazy you drove me
Talk about them favors you owe me
Talk about them
Talk about them lies you told me
Talk about true colors you showed me
Talk about them

[Outro: Gucci Mane]
Huh, Tiller, Gucci, huh, brr!
Woo, it’s Wizzop, huh!

[Intro]
If you're looking to fight
Then love, is what you can forget about
Baby, if you're mine
Then stay, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
We don't need to speak if it's spoken
We don't gotta fix what's been broken (Ooh)
I'm so sick of going through the motions
Lately you've been fucking up my focus (Alright)
And I just think I need some more patience, they say it's a virtue
And I know if I keep up this playing, bitches gon' hurt you
And I don't wanna be here alone, aw yeah
When you know it

[Chorus]
But I need you to notice
I need you, I need you to notice
I need you to know this, I need you, wow
Said I need you (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I done here before, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I done had two for one, yeah (One, yeah)
Yeah, you know, you havin' fun yet?
You know my plans for you, I took a chance on you (Oh-oh)
I've been counting my blessings
Working on my profession

You've been off since you left here (Ha)
I can't get back time

[Chorus]
But I need you to notice, yeah

[Bridge]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh-woah, oh

[Verse 3]
I've been countin' my blessings
Girl, when we fuckin', you play with my mind
Usin' sex as a weapon
Knowin' I'll hit it, she win every time
Paid a brick for my necklace
Man of my word, I just splurge on my bitch
Early, eatin' the pussy like it's breakfast
Stickin' my dick while she washin' them dishes
Bust it open for the ‘gram, bust it for the ‘gram

[Chorus]
But I need you to notice
I need you, I need you to notice
I need you to know this, I need you, I
Said I need you

[Outro]
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
I'm drawing lines from your home to mine
Making up for lost time
Cause there's not that much difference
The end will come, everyone shut down, pageantry, and parade
Stripped of all its significance

[Humming]

Your brothers eyes, were in disguise
As she agonized, trying to live just beside you
When someone finally tells you when
Your final home will lie
You step out, look around, and see if true love's still inside you

[Gospel Singing]

I'm not singing much, you don't already know
I just hope I'm giving voice to a song that's worth singing
Melody and harmony can electrify your soul
Give you all that you need
When the judgement bells are ringing

[Humming]

I'm drawing lines from your home to mine
Making up for lost time
Cause there's not that much difference
La la la la la la la la la...

Anticipate you grace to stage
Begin to play that stunning way
All eyes on u, in all black suits
The crowd goes silent in this place
Piano keys, the melody
That you select is teasing me

And I'm not really trying a be a bad girl (tonight)
But you about to make me be a bad girl (tonight)
Have another drink, then I'm gonna leave
But I'll make it worth your while
If you come over here and give me....

Some piano lessons, some piano lessons
Some piano lessons, some piano lessons
Oooh ehhhh
We'll write a song (la la la)
We'll write a song (la la la)
We'll write a song (la la la)
We'll write a song (la la la)
In the way you play it makes me wish I had your hands
Playing my body like it were an instrument
Do it so good boy, make me wanna do it back
Lesson's so good to me, I can write a song to that
We can be a duet you come to my home
Cause practice makes perfect, we'll practice all night long

And I'm not really trying a be a bad girl (tonight)
But you about to make me be a bad girl (tonight)
Have another drink, then I'm gonna leave
But I'll make it worth your while
If you come over here and give me....

Some piano lessons, some piano lessons
Some piano lessons, some piano lessons
Oooh ehhhh
We'll write a song (la la la)
We'll write a song (la la la)
We'll write a song (la la la)
Let's write a song (la la la)

If you come over here and give me...

Some piano lessons, some piano lessons
Some piano lessons, some piano lessons
Oooh ehhhh
We'll write a song (la la la)
We'll write a song (la la la)
We'll write a song (la la la)
We'll write a song (la la la)

Lips brush right ac
