grown tired of me?
What's it all about?

Listen, when we're alone it's not the same
I hold you close, yet you're so far away
You never seem to hear what I say
What's it all about, baby?

You don't have to lie
You don't have to hide
The feeling you have
For another guy

If there is someone closer to you
I'll be content with yesterday's memories
Honey, just say the word and we'll go our separate ways
What's it all about?

What's on your mind, I gotta know
Somebody tell me, baby
I wanna know what it's all about
What's on your mind
I gotta know, yeah yeah
Somebody tell me what it's all about
Don't give me that kind of love
I can't take it
Don't

I'll do the same for you, I'm for real

Don't be the kind of one to take my love
Leaving my in distress, thinking of
Just do the things that I do for you
You won't regret, baby

I'll be good to you
Got to be so good
I'll be good to you
Yes I will, yes I will
Don't promise me the things you can't do
Why would you disappoint my faith in you
Let me help you baby in my way
You'll never have to worry night or day

I'll be good to you
Got to be so good
Gonna be sweet to you
Yes I will, yes I will

Rock, rock, and you don't stop, c'mon
Nappy Boy
It's Travie! T-Pain
Yeah

[Chorus: T-Pain & (Travie McCoy)]
Hello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (How you doing?)
You are forever stuck to me
Hello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (How you doing?)
You are forever stuck to me

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Remember when rocking with tattoo's wasn't so cool?
I used to spend my time planning out my sleeves in school
Mind you, this was back in the early 90's
At the local tattoo shop was where you can find me
Now I was like everybody in they mama's covert
Like here's a bag of tattoos, just add water
Then she walked in painted from head to feet
I said, "That's the type of girl that I have to meet"

[Chorus: T-Pain & (Travie McCoy)]
Hello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (Hello, hello)
You are forever stuck to me
Hello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (Hello, hello)
You are forever stuck to me

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
She played tough, but I could tell she was feeling the kid
But deep down, she didn't even know she was killing the kid
I was only fifteen she was that times two
She had full color black and gray, fine line too
Where the portrait of Bettie Page on her right shoulder
I said, "Damn, I can't wait until I get older"
But for now, I guess I'll just sit and observe
And hope I pray that one day, I might build up the nerve
And say...

[Chorus: T-Pain & (Travie McCoy)]
Hello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (Hello, hello)
You are forever stuck to me
Hello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (Hello, hello)
You are forever stuck to me

[Verse 3: Travie McCoy]
Alright now, let's fast forward a couple of years
We going hard, working on my tattoo career
One day I looked up half way though a piece (Forever)
And it was Ms. Tattoo girl staring at me
She said, "Hey, I remember you from back in the day"
I said, "Yeah, the chubby kid without a word to say"
She said, "Damn, you grew up, man, time sure flying
You can hurry up on her 'cause I'm your next client

[Chorus: T-Pain & (Travie McCoy)]
Hello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (Hello, hello)
You are forever stuck to me
Hello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (Hello, hello)
You are forever stuck to me
Hello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (Hello, hello)
You are forever stuck to me
Hello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (Hello, hello)
You are forever stuck to me
You are forever stuck to me
You are forever stuck to me

[Verse 1]
Have you heard of goodbye?
We gon' fly away tonight
Glasses full of raspberry wine
Maybe appreciate the vibe
Girl, I know
I travel so I gotta pack up and go
We buying everything that we can afford
Straight with the plan
No, girl
Mmm, all laid out with some pillows
Mmm, I know you wanna snuggle
Ohh, it's only been a few hours
Damn shorty, let it go (Why?)

[Chorus]
Because she did it, did it, did it
D-did it, did it, did it, did it
She did it
Oh, your imperfections fit you so perfectly
That's how you did it, you did it to me
'Cause she did it, did it
Did it, she did it
Did it, did it, did it
She did it
In the Morning, babe
Can we wake up and do it again?

[Verse 2]
From your hair, to the sexy little things that you wear
We go together like a kick and a snare
This ain't your average every day love affair
No, you don't even try
I put you on a pedestal bonafide
Lord, take me down if I'm telling a lie
So would somebody please help me testify
And put your hands together for the girl?

[Chorus]
Mmm, all laid out with some pillows
Mmm, I know you wanna snuggle
Ohh, it's only been a few hours
Damn shorty mad atchu
Why?
Because she did it, did it, did it
D-did it, did it, did it, did it
She did it
Oh, your imperfections fit you so perfectly
That's how you did it, you did it to me
'Cause she did it, did it
Did it, she did it
Did it, did it, did it
She did it
In the morning, babe
Can we wake up and do it again?
Do it again

[Bridge]
I'll be your magic, be my allusion
Because when we're together, we're just so confusin'
And to the public
Yeah, they love it
We havin' wire image takin' pictures of it
Ooh, you so famous
Just wanna thank ya 'cause you came out with the classical behavior
Do me a favor?

Your eyes are so amazing

[Chorus]
Because she did it did it did it
D-did it did it did it did it
She did it
Oh, your imperfections fit you so perfectly
That's how you did it, you did it to me

[Chorus: Laura Les]
I can't say what it means that you came to my show
But it hurts when you don't, it hurts when you don't
I can't believe you came to my show
It hurts when you don't, it hurts when you don't
I-I-I can't believe you came to my show
It hurts when you don't, it hurts when you don't
I want to see you every day
It hurts and it shows, it hurts and it shows (It shows)

[Verse 1: Laura Les]
Do it big in the mine, like always
Do it big, gettin' diamonds like always
Grab my golden pick, and my golden axe
And my golden shovel, and my .40 mag
Everybody knows, I smoke the big weed
Everybody, get down, everybody, shut up
Everybody, this is my song
You can't believe what I put in my song

[Chorus: Laura Les]
I can't say what it means that you came to my show
But it hurts when you don't, it hurts when you don't
I can't believe you came to my show
It hurts when you don't, it hurts when you don't
I can't believe, you came to my show
It hurts when you don't, it hurts when you don't
I want to see you every day
But it hurts and it shows, it hurts and it shows

[Verse 2: Dylan Brady]
It's been a month, haven't seen the sun in days (Days)
Thought you said, come to show somewhere (Somewhere)
I need you right there in the front row (Front row)
Singin' every bar at the (gec) show (Hey)
But-but-but I said that I need you
Need you all the time and you know I wanna see you
I'll sing a song to you (Yeah) at the next show
I wanna see you there, it's been so long

[Chorus: Laura Les]
I can't say what it means that you came to my show
But it hurts when you don't, it hurts when you don't
I can't believe you came to my show
It hurts when you don't, it hurts when you don't
I-I-I can't believe you came to my show
It hurts when you don't, it hurts when you don't

I can't believe you came to my show
It hurts when you don't, it hurts when you don't
I want to see you every day
It hurts and it shows, it hurts and it shows (It shows)

[Verse 1: Halsey]
Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close
I was afraid to leave you on your own

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus: Halsey]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Halsey]
Gave love 'bout a hundred tries
Just running from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
Said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus: Halsey]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Everybody rock with me because I'm up now
Took your girl and I'ma score like I made the touchdown
Swervin' in that Lambo, doors go up, not on a bus now
Used to want a G-Shock, now I'm walking with a bust down
Pull up and I'm flooded with a iced out watch
Whip, it look like butter, baby, pecan drop
Pecan drop, put that four in Sun Drop
Stack my knots, count a lot, saw a lot
Got them rocks, diamond rocks, whip the pot

Now she wanna caress me, she keep tryna neck me

[Spoken Word: Justin Kuritzkes]
Hello potion seller, I’m going into battle and I want your strongest potions
My potions are too strong for you, traveller
Potion seller, I tell you I’m going into battle and I want only your strongest potions
You can’t handle my potions, they are too strong for you
Potion seller, listen to me, I want only your strongest potions
My potions would kill you traveller, you cannot handle my potions
Potion seller, enough of these games, I’m going to battle and I need your strongest potions
My strongest potions would kill you traveller, you can’t handle my strongest potions.You better go to a seller that sells weaker potions
Potion seller, I’m telling you right now, I’m going into battle and I need only your strongest potions
You don’t know what you asked traveller, my strongest potions would kill a dragon, let alone a man. You need a seller that sells weaker potions, because my potions are too strong
Potion seller, I’m telling you I need your strongest potions, I’m going into a battle, I’m going to battle, and I need your strongest potions
You can’t handle my strongest potions. No one can, my strongest potions are fit for a beast, let alone a man
Potion seller what do I have to tell you to get your potions? Why won’t you trust me with your strongest potions, potion seller? I need them if I’m to be successful in the battle
I can’t give you my strongest positions, because my strongest potions are only for the strongest beings and you are of the weakest
Well then, that’s it potion seller, I’ll go elsewhere, I’ll go elsewhere for my potions
That’s what you better do
I’ll go elsewhere for my potions and I’ll never come back
Good, you are not welcome here. My potions are only for the strongest and you are clearly not of the strongest, you are clearly of the weakest
You have had your say, potion seller, but I’ll have mine. You’re a rascal; you’re a rascal with no respect for the knights, no respect for anything except your potions
Why respect the knights? When my potions can do anything that you can?

[Verse 1: Celine Dion]
Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on

[Chorus: Celine Dion]
Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

[Bridge: Celine Dion]
Every night in-
Every night in-
Every night in-

Every night in-
Every night in-

[Verse 1: Dylan Brady]
I'm putting on your makeup, I don't have no money
Thinking of the way that you hurt me
All the ways you haunt me (Haunt me)
I don't wanna feel this way, no
You're the one who told me I could do it all
Okay, that's fine, I can take it in
I can get out of your way if that's really what you want
From me, right now
What you want from me, I don't know

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
I'll never go away (Never go away)
I'll be here every day (I'll be here every day)
We'll laugh and make mistakes (Laugh and make mistakes)
I don't think I can go and tell you
I'll never go away (Never go away)
I'll be here every day (I'll be here every day)
We'll laugh and make mistakes (Laugh and make mistakes)
I don't think I can go—

[Verse 2: Laura Les]
Toothache when I wake up, feelin' really really hurt now
Wishin that I was toothless, but that's just 'til the boof hits
I don't wanna cry now, I want the diamonds
That's why I'm mining, t-to give 'em all to you
I was sittin' on the flight to the show (To the show, yeah)
I thought I'd always be broke (Be broke, yeah)
On the flight comin' home in the back of the plane
Realised I was wrong, but my heart never changed

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
I'll never go away (Never go away)
I'll be here every day (I'll be here every day)
We'll laugh and make mistakes
I don't think I can go and tell you
I'll never go away (Never go away)
I'll be here every day (I'll be here every day)
We'll laugh and make mistakes
I don't think I can go and tell you

[Outro: Laura Les]
You're jumping in, we'll both get through
I need you to hear what I'm thinking of you
Hear what I'm thinking of you

[Verse 1]
I know it's not your fault, but I’m a locked door
And inside, I'm a mess by someone before
And I wish that I, I could find a key
To unlock all the things you want us to be

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me open up and start again
But there’s a safe around my heart
I don’t know how to let you in
And that’s what keeps us apart

[Chorus]
And that’s why I need time
I said I need you
I need you to understand, you, you, you
I need you to understand, you, you

[Verse 2]
Call up the locksmith
Tell him we need him quick
We’ve got a million keys
None of them seem to fit
While you’re on the phone
Call up the clocksmith
'Cause I could use some time
Even the slightest bit

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me open up and start again
And break this safe around my heart
I don’t know how to let you in
And that’s what keeps us apart

[Chorus]
And that’s why I need time
I said I need you
I need you to understand, you, you, you
I need you to understand

[Bridge]
I’m thinking now's the time
Maybe it's time to go
If I gave you my heart, be gentle
I’m tired of laying low, let's give the world a show
And when you know, you know
And when you know, you know, you know
And when you know, you know, you know, you know

[Chorus]
And that’s why I need time
I said I need you
I need you to understand, you, you, you
I need you to understand
I need you to understand
I need you to understand
I need you to understand

[Outro]
I need you
I need you
I need you, you, you

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shiny lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes, like, here lady have this
And last but not least, grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the ho-ho
Aha, get it?
I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go, I'mma have my own theme music

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Travie McCoy]
Oh, every time I close my eyes (What you see, what you see brah?)
I see my name in shiny lights (Uh-ha, uh-ha, yeah, what else?)
Oh, yeah, yeah, a different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare (For what?) for when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh, when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Let's go)

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
I be playing basketball with the president
Dunking on his delegates
Then I compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli' in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twennies, tens, and bens completely separate
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession, but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me
Would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars & Travie McCoy]
I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad (So bad)
Buy all of the things I never had (Buy everything, ha-ha)
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen (What up, Oprah? Ha-ha)

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Travie McCoy]
Oh, every time I close my eyes (What you see, what you see brah?)
I see my name in shiny lights (Uh-ha, uh-ha, yeah, what else?)
Oh, yeah, yeah, a different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare (For what?) for when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Sing it) when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)

[Outro: Bruno Mars & (Travie McCoy)]
I wanna be a billionaire (Uh-huh) so fucking bad
Every time I make a new start
Some girl, oh yeah, will break my heart

I've got to stop, baby, and check myself
Stop and check myself

Making love to you is so grand
I need somebody to hold my hand
I can't understand why you treat me this way
I need your lovin' from day to day

I've got to stop, baby, and check myself
Stop and check myself
Stop and check myself
Stop and check myself

[Chorus: Gunna]
Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot
I created history and made me a lot
He tried to diss me and ended on Fox
We call 'em chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop
Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Cartier eye
I'm the bossman in a suit but no tie
I can't be sober, I gotta stay high
Pour me some syrup in a Canada Dry
Ridin' in the spaceship like Bonnie and Clyde
Don't worry, baby, I keep me some fire
Shenenehs and Birkins, she cannot decide
The latest Mercedes her go-to surprise
Don't sleep on miss lady, her pussy a prize
Dick in her back while I'm grippin' her sides
Bigger Maybach, this ain't regular size
We really fly, we like pelican glide
Bitch, you ain't slick, I can tell the disguise
Upgraded my wrist, put baguettes in that Sky
She sing, I might sign her and change her whole life
I told her to gargle and work on her highs

[Chorus: Gunna]
Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot
I created history and made me a lot
He tried to diss me and ended on Fox
We call 'em chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop
Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock

[Interlude: Young Thug]
Cash, money, checks, cash
Addy, Birkin, brand new extendos
I just wanna fuck the bitch by myself
I just passed her to the dawg like my Sprite

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I took the Bentley coupe back, then I hopped in a Cayenne (Skrrt)
I put the bitch in the front of the Bentley, in front of the driver (Skrrt)
Ayy, man, this synthetic weed, you can't smoke in the Rolls Royce, woah, woah (Yeah, yeah)
I'm still double cupped up, I'm drinkin', I shoot off your tires, huh (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
I'm in the coupe by myself
I had to kick a door when I was 5
Keep the awards on the shelf
Whole sixteen round in the fire
I'm sick and tired of these young niggas act like they firin', they tellin' these lies
Actin' like they the ones created this and they get all the drip from my guys
Yeah, Cartier eyes
Cartier coat, Cartiers the watch
Cartier love, Cartier the thot
Cartier specs, buffalo on the side
Princess cut diamonds, they Cartier, yeah
Cartier bag for the Cartier thot
Sky Wrangler coupe with two hundred the dash
Cartier jeans, ain't no way I can sag
Ain't no way I'ma ever gon' go out bad
I can't go out, no way I'ma go out
I just grip on her ass and I show out
I sit like a champ and I wait on a hold-out
I just whip up a new Chanel Patek
I whip with the wrist and I don't break the door out
Turn the whole top floor to a whorehouse
Hundred racks in ones, dude brought the flood out (Oh)

Hot like the 504 Boyz how I move through the lobby (Hot)

Hundred mil' down on my desk, but I'm still up deciding (Straight up)
Match the M's in my account to the truck in my driveway (Skrrt, skrrt)
I'm in that four-door by myself
Know it's a hundred more niggas outside
Know they gon' ride 'til the death (Ooh)
Had some good years, ain't no way I get tired
I gotta do what I feel
Every day Super Bowl, fuck it, oh well
I put a lot on myself
In the field, Richard Mille on like Odell (Let's go)
She slid her hand down my pants just to grab the torpedo (Doo-doo-doo)
I had to go back and link with my slimes like I'm thirteen and zero (It's lit)
I told her, "Baby, this not the remix, this a part of the sequel" (Part of the seq')
No, we not livin' the same, we not makin' the same, we not equal (No), yeah, yeah, yeah
Look, mom, I can fly
Had some troubles, put that shit in the sky
Brought the angels, know the devil would try
It's so hot, you thought Paris Hilton done said it (Yeah, yeah)
When we come out, we can't help but leave damage (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Intro]
Alright
Right now

[Verse 1]
I'm in prison and I think I built my own cell
Prophets speak softly, homie, they don't yell
Only those that hear my music know my lower depths
The doer does, the knower rests
The scholar learns, the sage forgets
If I could wrap my head around it, then I might get a shot
I get what I think about whether I like it or not
When things go wrong, life doesn't stop
I need to quit pollutin' my mind with sex and violence
The secret that I'm seekin' was left in silence
And my microphone is pointin' God's finger
I'm a saint disguised as a pop singer
Here's a fun fact
Most people leave their potential untapped
There will be more than camping gear to unpack
Sometimes, you gotta go there just so you can come back

[Chorus]
Slow it down, I still got the feelin', baby
Slow it down, no more runnin' around
I said slow it down, I still got the feelin', baby
Slow it down, no more runnin' around

[Verse 2]
My foot hurts, I didn't get sleep
My dad died, my horoscope ain't in sync
I'm misunderstood and Twitter is ruthless
Uh oh, I think my problems are excuses
For not bein' who I know I am
I'm thirty-one, there's no one left to hold my hand
Though I believe I got someone watchin' over me
I believe I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be
I believe that even when the road is bleak
That these obstacles were set up just for me
And family matters, I'm on some Urkel shit
Posner on a Primo beat, this some full circle shit
I believe no matter how high the hurdles get
I can flip this whole thing into an internal win
Life ain't meant to be a heavy thing
Met Ram Dass, he told me, "Just love everything"
Fall in Michigan, there's wisdom in my loose leaf
For the first time, I feel like the true me

[Chorus]
Slow it down, I still got the feelin', baby
Slow it down, no more runnin' around
I said slow it down, I still got the feelin', baby
Slow it down, no more runnin' around

[Verse 3]
Some days, I can't get out of bed
Crippled by negative thoughts inside my head
Like why do I always stop before my limits?
And why am I only good at lovin' people from a distance?
Why am I so vain? Obsessed with fitness?
Why are the only people I'm around my assistants?
But wait, the last time I felt this way
I bucked up, kept goin' and got my shit straight
Diddy told me go with my heart
So my focus is art, not where I go on the chart
The divine light in me loves to glow in the dark
If my life was a movie, we'd be approachin' the part
Where the hero wins and learns don't
Chase what you already got and returns home
Those who say don't know, those who know don't say
I'm done walking with the herd, it's time I go my own way

[Chorus]
Slow it down, I still got the feelin', baby
Slow it down, no more runnin' around
I said slow it down, yeah, I still got the feelin', baby
Slow it down, no more runnin' around, yeah

[Intro]
(Woo-woo)

[Verse 1]
Wholly Holy
Come together holy
People we have got to come together
With all of the strength
The power in all of the feeling

Wholly Holy
We should believe
Believe in each others dreams
We've got to come together
Because we need the strength
And the power in all of the feeling
Wholly Holy

[Bridge]
Do you know that we can 

[?] salvation
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy

[Verse 2]
Jesus left
And said he would return
'Cause he left us a book to believe in
And in it we've still got a whole lot to learn
Wholly Holy
He can conquer this thing 

[?]

[Outro]
Wholly Holy, Holy, Wholly Holy
Wholly-Holy, Holy, Holy
Wholly- Holy, Holy Holy, Holy
Wholly Holy

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]

[Chorus: Alicia Keys, Miguel, Alicia Keys & Miguel]
Show me love
Treat it like we freakin' on the weekend, show me love

Yeah, I got you runnin' every time I give you some
Yeah

[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Verse 1]
There's a time that I remember, when I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever, and everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy

[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Post-Chorus]
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Verse 2]
There's a time that I remember when I never felt so lost
When I felt all of the hatred was too powerful to stop (Ooh, yeah)
Now my heart feel like an ember and it's lighting up the dark
I'll carry these torches for ya that you know I'll never drop, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy

[Chorus]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
Memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Verse 1]
The root of all evil
In a person with shiny eyes
And hair like a feather
Black leather and a charming smile
He'll touch you and burn you
And break you down to your core
Succumbing to evil
I thought I was something more

[Chorus]
Oh, Lucy, please
Quit taunting me
Oh, Lucy, please
Quit taunting, quit taunting
Quit taunting me

[Verse 2]
His mind is a fortress
You can't fight your way inside
His body's a temple
Made up of brimstone and fire
You cannot resist him
When you look in his shiny eyes
The face of an angel
With the heart of something less nice

[Chorus]
Oh, Lucy, please
Quit taunting me
Oh, Lucy, please
Quit taunting, quit taunting
Quit taunting me

[Verse 3]
Succumbing to evil
I thought I could never be
I look in the mirror
And the darkness looks back at me
I can't help the feeling
That irks me, that I'm falling down
From Heaven through the earth
To hellfire to wear his crown

[Chorus]
Oh, Lucy, please
Quit taunting me
Oh, Lucy, please
Quit taunting, quit taunting
Quit taunting, quit taunting
Quit taunting, quit taunting
Quit taunting me

[Verse 1]
Country boy ain't got no shoes
Country boy ain't got no blues
Well, you work all day while you're wanting to play
In the sun and the sand with a face that's tan
At the end of the day when your work is done
You ain't got nothing but fun

[Chorus]
Country boy ain't got no ills
Country boy, you don't owe no bills

[Verse 2]
You get a wiggly worm and then you watch him squirm
While you put him on a hook and you drop him in a brook
If everything's gonna turn out right
You're gonna fry fish tonight

[Chorus]
Country boy, got a lot to lose
Country boy, how I wish I was in your shoes

[Verse 3]
Country boy got a shaggy dog
Country boy up a holler log
Well, he comes in a run when you pick up your gun
And with a shell or two and your dog and you
When you get your rabbit you'll skin his hide
He's gonna be good fried

[Chorus]
Country boy, you got a lot to lose
Country boy, how I wish I was in your shoes

[Verse 4]
Country boy, you got work to do
Country boy in the morning dew
You gotta plant the seed, you gotta cut the weeds
There's many a row you know you gotta hoe
When it's quittin' time and your work is through
There's a lot of life in you

[Chorus 3]
Country boy, you're lucky free
Country boy, I wish I was you and you was me

[Intro: John Lennon]
Shoot me

[Intro: Dave Storrs]
Let your body rock!
Let your body rock!
Let your body rock!

[Verse 1: Ice-T]
Hip-hoppin' is the thing that's in
It's where the stone-cold nitro parties begin
So listen party people with the ear to the street
The college professors and the social elite
To the fly young guys and the pretty girls
Ice-T is gonna tell you 'bout that hip-hop world

[Verse 2: Ice-T]
Hip-hoppin' is a way of life
With graffiti and rappin' on the mic
As the records scratch to the break of beat
A-hip-hop is sounds of the street
Hip-hop has been around a while
With the serious funk, the disco style
A record scratch, a simple rap
A breaker spinnin' on his back

[Chorus: Dave Storrs]
Body Rock!
Body Rock!
Body Rock!

[Verse 3: Ice-T]
Now I don't care what people say
Hip-hop is here to stay
When the hip-hop scene first gained attention
They said it would die
They said it couldn't make it
They said it it'd never fly
Now everywhere for you to see
In movies, radio and TV
But the hip-hop scene has substance, unlimited dimensions
And it will live with or without mass media attention
'Cause it is not some fad created overnight
It is a cultural movement that's bred by city life
Now I'ma break it down for all of you
Who've never seen a hip-hop crew
The gangster cuts of cold DJs
Shockin' and rockin' 'til the break of day
Or the master arts of the graffiti man
Expressin' himself with his spray can
Yo people, what's it gonna be?
Hip-hop is makin' history
Now a hip-hop club is not a disco
It's a record-cuttin', cold-crushin' rappin' show
Like New York's Roxy, L.A.'s Radio
The DJs keep you at a peak and on the go
No three-piece suits allowed inside
T-shirts, tennis shoes, loosely tied
You hear scratchin' turntables across the floor
And DJs spin on two and sometimes four
Like this...

[Verse 4: Ice-T]
So when you listen to the music by your radio DJ
And listen to the rappers on the records that they play
And check out the graffiti that turns ghettos into art
Or watch the kids who dance on the street and in the park
We hope it's time you realize hip-hoppin' is the way
To find true peace in city streets in this cold world today
Let's dance, not fight, and all unite, just turn the box up loud
To the funky beat, on any street you'll find that hip-hop crowd

[Outro: Dave Storrs]
The Body Rock!
Keep your body rock!
Let your body rock!
Let your body rock!
Keep your body rock!
Let your body rock!
Body Rock!
Body Rock!
Just Body Rock!

[Intro]
Suckers step back, reacting his attack
Evil E's in the place, cold doggin' the wax!

[Verse 1]
All punks grab for your mothers, today's the day
I'm here to say warriors come out and play
Rhyme for your lives, weak run and hide
My name is Ice-T, L.A.'s where I reside
Fly as a bird, also awesome with herb
If you bite I will take your life best believe that's word
FBI's most wanted, but them suckers can't stop me
Mean rapping mother, terrorizing Qaddafi
Few tried to match the def raps I wrote
Dis my rhyme that's the time, razor meets your throat
Born in New Jersey but raised in L.A
Streets just as hard and the player's still play
Far from a fag, getting paid for my brag
So if you wanna come and battle bring a body bag
Definitely deadly and that ain't no Todd
And if you don't like what I'm saying, we can take it outside
'Cause ain't nothin' like a squabble 'cause you know I'ms fine
And if knife be your reason, then Uzi be mine
So all punks get ill cause you know I'm gonna
Rhymes that ignite bite like a piranha
Ice-T's just rockin' the tracks
And Evil E's in the place, just doggin' the wax!

[Verse 2]
I love the ladies who were down with the T
But what I hate and I state is a fool MC
You wanna battle the Ice, you gotta be insane
One step toward my reppin', I inflict the pain
Got so many raps, I got no place to store 'em
Got so many damn pages, I can wallpaper the Forum
Assassination, is my solution
No light operation, just massive contusions
Def dealing rhymer with a lust for blood
Conflict with the master and your name is mud
Kick it up, no mercy for the fact you're brave
I'll just bury your butt, then I'll spit on your grave
Laugh at your family as they stand and cry
Cold smack your mother all in the eye
'Cause I'll never get to heaven but you know damn well
I'll wear Bermuda shorts while I'm maxin' in hell
So all suckers step back, reacting the death's attack
Don't try to write me off, just talking like way smack
Because I'll leave a shamble, I hustle don't gamble
And I'll rock your butt blind like HBO scramble
Doggin' the wax!

[Verse 3]
Sharp as a razor, down as dirt
Rhyme is my life, party is my work
L.A. is my place, More Righteous is my base
So my lyrics make sense, no words I waste
Down for a duel, colder than Kool
Chill with the brothers who built the old school
Rhyme like a rocket, smooths in the pocket
Program the 808 and just lock it
Crash the studio with my crew, twenty four tracks mixed down to two
Jam hits the stores, packed kinds of floors
Freaks in my hotel room by the scores
This MC Ice-T, I rock the freaks to ecstasy
Take them to the T-O-P and bust them out officially
Never off, always on, rockin' to the break of dawn
Like this, like that, an MC that's not the whack
All rappers in the game, recognize my name
They write off as been lame, or get me credit for my fame
I'm here to make it clear, '86 is my year
I'm the rapper you should fear and I'll have to peer
Supreme MC Chief, and when I die in my belief
Battle from L.A. to Rome, rock beyond the Thunderdome
Sound hard, know why? It is, don't try
Only the top MCs will master this ability
If you do, you'll find out what that misword 

[?]
Or run that other 

[?], for high speed poetry
Take advice from Ice-T, leave the cuts to Evil E
Get a girl, feel the bass, rock her at this funky pace, ah!

[Verse 4]
I'm dialing M, for murdering fine MC's heads
Showing no remorse, reanimatin' the dead
Kicking dirt in the wombs, turning a wheel in the rap
I'll make you run for the hills with a streak up your back
My rhymes are my pigeons, stock cooler than cold
Boys always convincing, jewelry solid gold
Magnified finesse, a Hollywood address
The perpetrator, cremator, representing the West
Avenge is my best friend, homicide is my life
I write my rhymes in my book with blood on the knife
Never been beaten in life, never planned to beat
Either rocked two days straight before I take a breath
The rhymes, memorize them like inside my head
And anyone who dared bite somehow ends up dead
Got a license to kill, dogs refusing to chill
Uncut violence is my true thrill
I'm a hitman kinda sort of, suckers talk in manure
With co-cold man known tactics, no man can endure
Not to be mistaken, when MCs fakin'
All contracts issued, to Ice-T are taken, with the multitude routes
You have no chance to shout
With the silencer of a ninja, your lights are out
Girls cry to sight, some in Latin fight
For the post positions at my jam each night
The player from L.A., cooler than any Jay!
My name is Ice-T, I make the mafia pay!
Doggin' the wax!

[Intro: Ice-T]
T is dogging the wax
Word word

[Verse One: Ice-T]

Bass bass girls feel the bass rock
Rock it then rock it then

Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3]
I'm on a Mission Impossible
I turned my fantasy optical
Pot to piss in to a pot of gold (Woah)
I got the lava flow (Woah)
Vision bigger than Galapagos (Woah)
Middle fingers to your honor though (Look, fingers up)
You got an attitude problem, I got a lattitude problem
I'm up out the bullshit
You gon' make me get the mask
And the Batman like we in Gotham
Know that's an option
I'm a little off the Henessey
Just so you know the authenticity
Why you gotta be the centerpiece?
And kill of all the energy
Why can't we just live in synergy? (Huh? Huh?)

[Chorus]
Why are you so emotional? Woah, woah, woah, woah
Emotional, woah, woah, woah, woah (I gotta ask, like)
Why are you so emotional? Woah, woah, woah, woah

Why'm I still talkin' to you?
Emotional, woah, woah, woah, woah
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3]
Why you gotta put me on the spot when you know I hate 

[?]?
You know I try take a seat when I can't understand it (Woah)
And why you gotta raise hell instead of standards?
When did the happy home abandon?
Look, Goddamn it
You got an attitude problem, I got an altitude problem
Fuck the bullshit, if you need it I will get the mask
And the Batman just like we in Gotham

I was dreamin' when I wrote this
Forgive me if it goes astray
But when I woke up this mornin'

Could've sworn it was judgment day

The sky was all purple
There were people runnin' everywhere
Tryin' 2 run from the destruction
U know I didn't even care

Say say
Two-thousand-zero-zero party over
Oops out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999

I used to go out to parties, and stand around
'Cause I was too nervous, to really get down
But my body yearned to be free
I got up on the floor, somebody could choose me

No more standin' there beside the walls
Finally got myself together, baby, and I'm havin' a ball
Long as you're groovin', there's always a chance
Somebody watchin' might wanna make romance

Move your body, ooh baby, you dance all night
To the groove and feel alright
Everybody's groovin' on like a fool
But if you see me, spread out and let me in
Baby, just party high and low
Let me step into your erotic zone

Move it up, turn it 'round
Ooo, shake it down
Oww, you can love me when you want to, babe
This is such a groovy party, baby
We're here face to face, everybody's swingin'
This is such a groovy place
All the young ladies are so fine
You're movin' your body easy with no doubts
I know what you thinkin', baby, you want to turn me out
I think I'm gonna let you do it, babe

Keep on dancin'
Got to give it up

Keep on dancin'
Got to give it up

Keep on dancin'
Got to give it up

Keep on dancin'
Got to give it up

Keep on dancin'
Got to give it up...

[Verse 1]
Just because I'm losing
Doesn't mean I'm lost
Doesn't mean I'll stop
Doesn't mean I'm across
Just because I'm hurting
Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserve
No better or no worse

[Chorus]
I just got lost
Every river that I've tried to cross
Every door I ever tried was locked
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off

[Verse 2]
You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won, 'cause along may come
A bigger one

[Chorus]
And you'll be lost
Every river that you try to cross
Every gun you ever held went off
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'til the firing stopped
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Things like this ain't built to last
I might just fade like those before me (Like those before me)
When will you forget my past?
Got questions, ask, you know the stories (Know the stories)
And you need to let me know
When you leave and where you go
Can I come? (Can I come?)
Do you believe me, are you close?
Yeah, even if you don't, that'll get you sprung (That'll get you sprung)

[Chorus 1]
Do I, do I, do I love?
Can I, can I, can I get enough?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, don't run away love, hate love
Heart break will have you bankrupt
Too many days in a daze, better wake up
I'll put your face in the place where the space was
Nobody make you feel like you but (Do I?)
And you don't know what you should do
You just looking for someone to make you move
Ooh, tell me (Do I?)

[Chorus 2]
I make this planet feel like home
It's us versus time, the door is closing
So far beyond all our control
You saved a soul so close to broken (So close to broken)

Forever and a day, it's all I got (It's all I got)

[Chorus 1]
Do I, do I, do I love?
Can I, can I, can I get enough?

[Verse 4]
Yeah, I never slip, I never fall
I try to tell you 'bout a better life, you get involved
Big or small, it's been my fault
I keep you safe, it's in the vault
Blind folded keep it going 'til we hit a wall
Yeah, I'm never going through the motions
I'm just tryna lay your body down slowly
We can only go up (Go up), we can only go up (Go up)

[Chorus 2]
I make this planet feel like home
It's us versus time, the door is closing
So far beyond all our control
You saved a soul so close to broken (So close to broken)

[Chorus 1]
Do I, do I, do I love?
Can I, can I, can I get enough?

[Verse 1]
Okay!
Just because I'm losing
Doesn't mean I'm lost
Doesn't mean I'll stop
Doesn't mean I'm across
Just because I'm hurting
Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserve
No better or no worse

[Chorus]
I just got lost
Every river that I tried to cross
Every door I ever tried was locked
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off

[Verse 2]
You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won, 'cause along may come
A bigger one

[Chorus]
You'll be lost
Every river that you try to cross
Every gun you ever held went off
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'til the firing stops
Oh, and I'm, oh, just waiting 'til the shine wears off (Woo!)

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost

[Intro]
Yeah, said I

[Verse 1]
Made a promise with my deranged conscious
In return he told me the voice in my head would quiet down
All I gotta do is never speak of his existence or eternal soul
Otherwise it's terminal
And I hate to worry those
With my dirty nose and my perverted ways
It hurts me that I hurt you
Never meant to cause a person pain
Deteriorate a skeleton, regurgitate my vertebrae
Lord, I beg your mercy
Can you take me on a perfect day?
I always wondered what determines fate
And who's tendin' to the garden by the pearly gates
They don't want you to be anything but what they tell you
Sell you on a lie and watch the murder rate circulate
Lord merciful
He ride around heaven in his '69 convertible
No shirt beneath the purple coat
Known to get surgical at the turkey bowl
He throw a baseball like a motherfuckin' girl though

[Chorus]
What is this underworld you speak of
And why is everybody tryna teach us?
Why is it considered so rude to walk around in the nude
And why do we hurt the ones that we love?
Yeah, I always wondered if Jesus had a ego
Insecurities when he got emo
Why do I insist on goin' over your head?
Why don't I just make hits?
Gotta be so weird

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
I've been awake for so long, I feel myself disintegratin'
But I'll never stop the innovation
I'm addicted to creation, that's the world's greatest miracle
My vehicle, no one told me how to steer it though
I'm toyin' with my hallucinations
Hope it don't spoil and turn into inferno
I'm lost in the wormhole, searchin' for the hurt souls
Watchin' as the germs grow
Take over the Earth slow
I'm unaware in a comfy chair sippin' Merlot
Waitin' 'til I hear my number called and it's my turn to go
Insomnia, oh, how I always get along witcha
They don't want us to be friends, but I'm so fond of ya
And I can stay in Narnia forever
The human brain couldn't measure how the pleasure feel
I disagree with what they said was real
And, if this a war I need a better shield
Yeah

[Outro]
This ain't nothin' but another idea to be forgotten at the bottom of a drawer in my apartment, lost
I tried to bargain with the man upstairs
I just hope I got a fan up there

[Verse]
Some of those that work forces are the same that burn crosses
Some of those that work forces are the same that burn crosses

You justify those that died
For wearing the badge, they're the chosen whites
You justify those that died
By wearing the badge, they're the chosen whites

What else should I say? Everyone is gay
What else should I write? I don't have the right
What else should I be? All apologies

[Chorus]
In the sun, in the sun, I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun
Married, married

[Verse 2]
I wish I was like you, easily amused
Find my nest of salt, everything is my fault
I’ll take all the blame, aqua seafoam shame
Sunburn, freezer burn, choking on the ashes of her enemy

[Chorus]
In the sun, in the sun, I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun
Married, married
Married, married
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters
Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

[Chorus]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

[Verse 2]
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

[Chorus]
Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah-yeah!

[Verse 1]
A-this thing (This thing)
I called love (I called love)
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get 'round to it, I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love
A-this thing
I called love
It cries
In a cradle all night
It swings
It jives
It shakes all over like a jelly fish, woo, I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love

[Chorus]
There goes my baby
She knows how to rock 'n' roll (Rock 'n' roll)
She drives me crazy (Crazy)
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat

[Verse 2]
I gotta be cool (Be cool)
Relax (Relax)
Get hip (Get hip)
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motorbike until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love

[Chorus]
There goes my baby (Baby)
She knows how to rock 'n' roll
She drives me crazy (Crazy)
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat

Relax (Relax)
Get hip (Get hip)
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat (Back seat)
Hitch-hike (Hitch-hike)
And take a long ride on my motorbike until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love, crazy little thing called love

[Intro]
Yeah
And if you can't smoke weed to it, I don't wanna listen to it

[Verse]
(Uh) As the world keeps spinning
Keep turning these girls to women
Keep driving these cars and keep fucking these stars, I guess that's the world we live in
Young niggas with executive decisions
Turn on the TV and see us winning
They wanna be me, I just wanna be free
Never heard 'em talk cheap, fuck a bad bitch to sleep
Take Tequila shots in the AM
Give you a play by play on how to get this paper
I gettin' big, changed the gate code on my neighbours
Catching plays in the studio for days
Baby girl, come through, hook me up a plate
I've been grinding and my niggas on the same page
Walking up and gettin' to it
Trees grinded and pressed
Not a role model but I speak my mind
Doing more than what you're thinking
In the studio, blowin' O's, but our minds on the future tho'
Brainwash a couple bitches, bring 'em to the show
Take 'em to the crib, let you hit a switch, it ain't 'bout shit
Talk it up, then live it out
Smell the aroma when I park the car and get up out
And go the way you niggas drove
I get a bitch I barely know
Get her home
Don't want mamosas, she want Tequila shots in the AM
Give you a play by play on how to get this paper
I'm gettin' big, now them niggas sayin' we major
Rollin' J's on the beach, catching rays
(Hmm, yeah)
Merry Christmas, baby
You sure did treat me nice
Merry Christmas pretty, baby
You sure did treat me nice
Gave me a diamond ring
For Christmas
Now I'm living in paradise

Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
Well
I would have kissed you, baby
While you're standing
Beneath the mistletoe

Well, alright
Ain't that the truth now

Santa came down the chimney
About a half past three
He brought
These pretty presents
That you see before me
Merry Christmas, baby
You sure been good to me
I haven't had
A toddy this morning
But I'm all lit up
Like a Christmas tree

Well, I wanna
Wanna bring
It a little bit high
Well, I
Well I wanna bring
It a little bit high
Oh, I wanna bring
It a little bit high, baby
No, wanna bring
It a little high, baby
Little high

Haven't had
A toddy this morning
But I'm all lit up
But I'm all lit up
But I'm all lit up
But I'm all lit up
Said I'm all lit up
I'm all lit up, baby
Merry Christmas, baby
Merry, merry, merry, merry
Merry Christmas, baby

...in Florida, and I took one hit off that Juul
And I'm like, wait a minute!
Let me do another one!
Let me do another!
Oh my god, I feel so sick, but give it to me!
Like, I mean, that's just the way I'm built
It was making me sick, and I kept doing it
I- you know what, I just thought like-
This is one of those things that would feel awful, but I would-
I would use it through that
I would get through that awful feeling, and I'd be addicted to it
(laughter)
I told you, that's what all the- said when we both quit smoking
And then he starts again, I go
Why did he stop- why did he start?
He behaves like he can't even get over that
That can't go through that
And that's just how I am
So there you go
Ehm, so I'll...

[Verse 1: Vegyn]
I have to admit something
Two years
All you got is nothing
New fears or new fears
Apple or nothing
Eliciting something
The less you
Think of me
I said it so clearly
You're still ignoring me
You don't know the half of me
This is something you'll have to wait

[Outro: Halo 3: Starry Night Trailer]
You ever wonder what's up there?
Like what?
Maybe someone up there is wondering what it's like here
I guess. Do you think we'll ever meet them?
I hope so. Don't you?
Big ol' shooting star just now right in front of the jet, it's cool
Oh, did ya make a wish?

[Outro]
千万不要忘记
你走到哪里
我永远在你身边
I wish there was something between today and tomorrow
But I don't even know what I wish that would be
The days just keep running into one another

Poppin' you, poppin' you
Smoke smoke that
Smoke smoke that
Smoke that
Dope that
Smoke smoke smoke that
Smoke that
Dope that
Smoke smoke that
Smoke that
Poppin' you, poppin' you poppin' you

Poppin' you, poppin' you poppin' you
Smoke smoke that

Smoke smoke
Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly
Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly
Peanut butter jelly, no deli
I got money, check the store credit
No new names unless you know they did it
Sleep in Paris, watch it happen
I don't have a break, I'm keepin' bread
I'm gettin' fast like a track, mil' I want that
Baby that cap's for the feds
That ain't your ho, don't tell all the secrets
I don't give no damn 'bout no nigga
I don't give no fuck 'bout no nigga, I promise, I promise
I throw me some ones on these bitches
I stack them hundreds to the ceiling, they over there runnin'
I look like I came from nothin'
And I look like I came for somethin' and I'm comin', I want it
Yeah, I drink on that lean
And I smoke on that dope 'til I motherfuckin' vomit
Run up…

[Verse]
Cockiness, my first name
Conceited, that’s my birth name
Stand on my own feet and use my penis as my third leg
The meanest nigga per-se
She fiendin' from the first date
I wanna put my name on it, it’s not even my birthday
Tell Ri-Ri I go re-retarded
On a remix had to re-record it
On a CD, DVD, MP3 and TV, see me for it
I go cuckoo for your coucou
Your flying fish is my favorite dish
Won't hear crickets when I crick it
Hit it play games like soccer when we kick it
Get it?
Then it's like
Pretty motherfucker with the mossberg
Jiggy motherfucker at my concerts
I'm wearin' fox furs, rockin' oxfords
Eatin' oxtails, sippin' Cockspur
Silly motherfuckers lookin' awkward
So much dick ridin' that my cock hurt
Pause, runnin' clockwork
So you pop work, and we got work
Umm, how we got work
Umm, we got work, and we got work
Hand it off, let 'em die
Anna Rose, big guy
That Santa Claus, big body
That Phantom Rolls, too hot
Nigga fend them off, 2Pac
Bandana on, bandana off
Standin' up wit my Flacko out
With your man at home, bitch

[Verse 1]
I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
To take me anywhere in seconds
To take me anywhere I wanna go
And drive around a faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I will settle for nothing less

[Verse 2]
I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
At the touch of a button
I can go anywhere I wanna go
And drive around a faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I will settle for nothing less

[Chorus]
I think I want to change my altitude
I think I want to change my oxygen
I think I want to change my air
My atmosphere
I wanna recharge

[Verse 3]
I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
To take me anywhere in seconds
To take me anywhere I wanna go
And drive around my faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I will settle for nothing less

[Chorus]
I think I need to change my attitude
I think I want to change my oxygen
I think I want to change my air
My atmosphere
I wanna recharge

[Outro]
Bigger and better
Bigger and better
Bigger and better
Bigger and better
Bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
At the touch of a button
I can go anywhere I wanna go

[Verse 1]
You caught the same train
And you took it back
To the same place
You're back where you started
It's the same thing
You keep trying to do something different
Over and over again

[Chorus]
Something has to change
Something has to change
Something has to change

[Verse 2]
And it's the same thing
You're repeating yourself
And it's the same girl who's giving you hell
And it's the same face
Your heart keeps breaking in the same place

[Chorus]
Something has to change
Something has to change
Something has to change
Something has to change
Something has to change

[Bridge]
And it's the same thing
You're repeating yourself
And it's the same girl who's giving you hell
And it's the same face
Your heart keeps breaking in the same place

[Chorus]
Something has to change
Something has to change
Something has to change
Something has to change

[Verse 3]
And you look back
You're going 'round in circles
Your world feels just the same
Your heart keeps breaking in the same way

[Chorus]
Something has to change
Something has to change
Something has to change
Something has to change
Something has to change
Something has to change
Something has to change
Something has to change

[Verse 1]
Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again?
The Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself

[Verse 2]
Hopes may rise on the Grasmere
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down to the safety of the town
But there's panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself

[Chorus]
Burn down the disco
Hang the blessed DJ
Because the music that they constantly play
It says nothing to me about my life
Hang the blessed DJ
Because the music they constantly play

[Verse 3]
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
Provincial towns you jog 'round

[Outro]
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ

[Vocal Outro]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
I was minding my business
Lifting some lead off
The roof of the Holy Name church
It was worthwhile living a laughable life
To set my eyes on the blistering sight

[Chorus]
Of a Vicar in a tutu
He's not strange
He just wants to live his life this way

[Verse 2]
A scanty bit of a thing
Oh, with a decorative ring
That wouldn't cover the head of a child
As Rose collects the money in a canister
Who comes sliding down the bannister?

[Chorus]
The vicar in a tutu
He's not strange
He just wants to live his life this way

[Verse 3]
And the monkish monsignor
With a head full of plaster
Said "My man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
As Rose counts the money in the canister
As natural as rain
He dances again
My God!

[Chorus]
Vicar in a tutu
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
La, la, la

Oh, the vicar in a tutu
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 4]
The next day in the pulpit
With freedom and ease
Combatting ignorance, dust, and disease
As Rose counts the money in the canister
As natural as rain
He dances again and again and again

[Outro]
In the fabric of a tutu
Any man could get used to
And I am the living sign
I'm the living sign
I am, I am the living sign
I am the living sign
I am a living sign
I am the living sign, sign
I am a living sign
Oh

[Intro]
This is our new single "Ask"

[Verse 1]
Shyness is nice and shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life that you'd like to
Shyness is nice and shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life that you'd like to

[Refrain]
So, if there's something you'd like to try
If there's something you'd like to try
Ask me, I won't say "no"
How could I?

[Verse 2]
Coyness is nice and coyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life that you'd want to

[Refrain]
So, if there's something you'd like to try
If there's something you'd like to try
Ask me, I won't say "no"
How could I?

[Verse 3]
Spending warm summer days indoors
Writing frightening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg

[Refrain]
Ask me, ask me, ask me
Ask me, ask me, ask me

[Chorus]
Because if it's not love
Then it's the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb that'll bring us together

[Bridge]
Nature is a language, can't you read?
Nature is a language, can anybody read?

[Refrain]
So ask me, ask me, ask me
Ask me, ask me, ask me

[Chorus]
Because if it's not love
Then it's the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb that will bring us together
If it's not love
Then it's the bomb
And then it's the bomb that will bring us together

[Refrain]
So ask me, ask me, ask me
Ask me, ask me, ask me
Oh

[Outro]
Na na na, na na
Na na na, na na
Na na na, na na

[Verse 1]
Smoke lingers 'round your fingers
Train - Heave on to Euston

[Chorus]
Do you think you've made the right decision this time?
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
You've left your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But did you see the jealousy in the eyes of the ones who had to stay behind?

[Chorus]
And do you think you've made the right decision this time?

[Verse 3]
Left your girlfriend on the platform
With this really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows that when he goes, oh, he really goes

[Chorus]
And do you think you've made the right decision this time?

[Instrumental Outro]

[Chorus]
The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A murderous desire
For love

[Verse 1]
How can they look into my eyes
And still they don't believe me?
How can they hear me say those words
Still they don't believe me?
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever believe me?
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever, they ever, believe me?
Oh-oh
Oh, oh
Dun dun, oh

[Chorus]
The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A plundering desire
For love

[Verse 2]
How can they see the love in our eyes
And still they don't believe us?
And after all this time
Oh, they don't want to believe us
And if they don't believe us now
Will they ever believe us?
And when you want to live, how do you start?
Where do you go? Who do you need to know?
Oh no, you know

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, no, oh
Oh, oh
Oh
Oh la da, la da, la da, la da, la dum
Oh la da, la da, la da, la da, la dum
Oh la da, la da, la da, la da, la dum
Oh la da, la da, la da, la da, la dum

[Intro]
This one is called "Is It Really So Strange?"
Eh

[Verse 1]
I left the North, I travelled South
I found a tiny house and I can't help the way that I feel
Oh yes, you can kick me, and you can punch me
And you can break my face
But you won’t change the way I feel
'Cause I love you, oh

[Chorus]
And is it really so strange?
Oh, is it really so strange?
Oh, is it really so, really so strange?
I say no, you say yes
But you will change your mind

[Verse 2]
I left the South, I travelled North
I got confused, I killed a horse, I can't help the way I feel
Oh yes, you can kick me and you can butt me
And you can break my spine
But you won’t change the way I feel
'Cause I love you, oh

[Chorus]
And is it really so strange?
Oh, is it really so strange?
Oh, is it really so, really so strange?
I say no, you say yes
But you will change your mind

[Verse 3]
I left the North again, I travelled South again
And I got confused, I killed a nun, I can't help the way I feel
I can't help the way I feel
I can't help the way I feel
I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell

[Verse 4]
Why is the last mile the hardest mile?
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes
And I realised, I realised, I could never
I could never, never go back home again

[Outro]
Thank you
Thank you

[Chorus]
A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
While Wilde is on mine

[Verse 1]
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
All those people, all those lives
Where are they now?
With loves, with hates
And passions just like mine
They were born
And then they lived
And then they died
Seems so unfair
Oh, I want to cry

[Refrain 1]
You say, "'Ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn"
And you claim these words as your own
But I’ve read well and I've heard them said
A hundred times, maybe less, maybe more

[Verse 2]
If you must write prose and poems
The words you use should be your own
Don't plagiarise or take "on loan"
There’s always someone, somewhere
With a big nose, who knows
And who trips you up and laughs
When you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh
When you fall

[Refrain 2]
You say, "'Ere long done do does did"
Words which could only be your own
And then produce the text
From whence was ripped
Some dizzy whore, 1804

[Chorus]
A dreaded sunny day
So let's go where we're happy
And I'll meet you at the cemetry gates
Oh, Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
So let's go where we're wanted
And I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
But you lose
’Cause weird lover Wilde is on mine
Sugar

[Verse 1]
I can feel the soil falling over my head
And as I climb into an empty bed
Oh well, enough said

[Chorus]
I know it's over, still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over

[Verse 2]
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
See, the sea wants to take me
The knife wants to cut me
Do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
Handsome groom, give her room
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
Though she needs you more than she loves you

[Chorus]
And I know it's over, still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over it's over it's over it's over
Over and over
I know it's over, and it never really began
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me and said

[Verse 3]
"If you're so funny
Then why are you on your own tonight?
And if you're so clever
Then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very entertaining
Then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very good-looking
Why do you sleep alone tonight?
I know, 'cause tonight, it's just like any other night
That's why you're on your own tonight
Your triumphs and your charms
While they're in each other's arms"

[Chorus 2]
It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
It takes strength to be gentle and kind
Over, over, over, over, over
It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
It takes guts to be gentle and kind
Over, over
Love is natural and real
But not for you, my love
Not tonight, my love
Love is natural and real
But not for such as you and I
My love

[Outro]
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head, oh
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head, oh
And please, please
Soil over, over my head, oh
Oh, over, oh
Over
Over
Over
Over my head
Oh

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
Oh

[Verse 1]
I decree today that life
Is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
But ask me why and I'll spit in your eye, oh
Oh, ask me why and I'll spit in your eye
But we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
No, we cannot cling to those dreams

[Refrain]
Does the body rule the mind
Or does the mind rule the body?
I don't know

[Chorus]
Under the iron bridge we kissed
And although I ended up with sore lips
It just wasn't like the old days anymore
No, it wasn't like those days
Am I still ill?
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh am I still ill?
Oh, no
Oh, no

[Refrain]
Does the body rule the mind
Or does the mind rule the body?
I don't know

[Verse 3]
Ask me why and I'll die
Oh ask me why and I'll die
And if you must go to work tomorrow
Well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
For there are brighter sides to life
And I should know because I've seen them
But not very often

[Chorus]
Under the iron bridge we kissed
And although I ended up with sore lips
It just wasn't like the old days anymore
No, it wasn't like those days
Am I still ill?
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, am I still ill?
Oh, no
Oh, no, oh

[Chorus]
If I die before I wake up, pray the Lord my soul to take
Repent for my sins and meet him at the golden gate
Lost some of my dawgs, so in my heart, man, it's this frozen place
Gotta watch for your soul, man, you could go today

[Verse]
Oh, my dawg, I'm finna meet you at them golden gates
We sat together like a pair of fucking roller skates
Ridin' around inside that Civic with the stolen plates
They got a nigga feeling colder than the frozen lakes
Fell on my knees with all the Gs, man, it ain't no complaints
Gotta keep it real, dawg, never would you squeal, dawg
Fuck the frenemies and the enemies, this was my real dawg
See, even if you six feet deep, my nigga, you're still squad
And I'm finna hold your place when I see your daughter face
I wish I could re-wrote all them dates and have some soldiers placed
Even if it was on my time, I'd make them hold they place
Lord knows I ain't condoning, but they be shooting like it's Golden State
I got so much pain in what I used to call a golden place
Sip my liquor straight, 'cause when I sip, man, I can't cope with chase
Man, I lost my dawg, I lost my squad, I lost my fam, dawg
How many streets that I'm thuggin' in, I tryna get bam, dawg
When you were scamming, dawg, you would the Lamb and floss
We was both abandoned, we was trapping out of bandis, dawg
Thought that he could scam it all, but they gave him a headshot
Know that when you livin' you gon' die by that red dot
Cops is like some fire ants, so we was ducking red hots
Twistin' on them blocks, had make us lock it like it was dreadlocks
And I miss my dawg, was fighting fed shots
I can't believe this life done brought you to a dead stop
We were fighting fed cases, counting up these dead faces
Talking about this money we finna invest, 'cause the next year was pacin'
Never had no scared face, you was 10 toes down
Right behind a nigga when I was down with 10 fours 'round
When them niggas surround you, see who's around you, that's how it goes down
You was in a cold town, they caught you when you was slowed down
Prayin' five times a day, just tryin' to spill my soul out
'Posed be with me on tour days, 'cause everything is sold out, nah, nah, nah
I wish I could stunt one more time wit' my nigga
Hit the corner, jump one more time wit' my nigga
Wish I could get it jumpin' one more time wit' my nigga
I think about you everyday, yeah, I gotchu

[Chorus]
If I die before I wake up, pray the Lord my soul to take
Repent for my sins and meet him at the golden gate
Lost some of my dawgs, so in my heart, man, it's this frozen place
Gotta watch for your soul, man, you could go today

[Verse 1]
All men have secrets and here is mine
So let it be known
We have been through hell and high tide
I can surely rely on you
And yet you start to recoil
Heavy words are so lightly thrown
But still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you

[Chorus 1]
So, what difference does it make?
So, what difference does it make?
It makes none
But now you have gone
And you must be looking very old tonight

[Verse 2]
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
Because you asked me to
But now you make me feel so ashamed
Because I've only got two hands
Well, I'm still fond of you, oh-ho-oh

[Chorus 2]
So, what difference does it make? Oh
So, what difference does it make? Oh-ho
It makes none
But now you have gone
And your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight

[Verse 3]
Oh, the devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole, and then I lied
Just because you asked me to
But now you know the truth about me
You won't see me anymore
Well, I'm still fond of you, oh-ho-oh

[Outro]
But no more apologies
No more, no more apologies, oh
I'm too tired
I'm so sick and tired
And I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you, oh-ho-oh
Oh, my sacred one
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
So, goodbye
Please stay with your own kind
And I'll stay with mine

There's something against us
It's not time
It's not time
So, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

I know I need hardly say
How much I love your casual way
Oh, but please put your tongue away
A little higher and we're well away
The dark nights are drawing in
And your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
And "love" is just a miserable lie
You have destroyed my flower-like life
Not once - twice
You have corrupt my innocent mind
Not once - twice
I know the wind-swept mystical air
It means : I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
It means: I'd like to seize your underwear
What do we get for our trouble and pain ?
Just a rented room in Whalley Range
What do we get for our trouble and pain?
...Whalley Range!
Into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...



I need advice, I need advice
I need advice, I need advice
Nobody ever looks at me twice
Nobody ever looks at me twice

I'm just a country-mile behind
The world

I'm just a country-mile behind
The whole world
Oh oh, oh...

I'm just a country-mile behind
The world

I'm just a country-mile behind
The whole world
Oh oh, oh...

Take me when you go
Oh oh, oh...

Take me when you go
Oh oh, oh...
I need advice, I need advice

[Verse 1]
All the streets are crammed with things
Eager to be held
I know what hands are for
And I'd like to help myself
You ask me the time
But I sense something more
And I would like to give you
What I think you're asking for

[Pre-Chorus]
You handsome devil
Oh, you handsome devil

[Chorus]
Let me get my hands
On your mammary glands
And let me get your head
On the conjugal bed
I say, I say, I say

[Verse 2]
I crack the whip
And you skip
But you deserve it
You deserve it, deserve it, deserve it

A boy in the bush
Is worth two in the hand
I think I can help you get through your exams

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you handsome devil

[Chorus]
Oh, let me get my hands
On your mammary glands
And let me get your head
On the conjugal bed
I say, I say, I say

[Verse 3]
I crack the whip
And you skip
But you deserve it
You deserve it, deserve it, deserve it
And when we're in your scholarly room
Who will swallow whom?
And when we're in your scholarly room
Who will swallow whom?

[Pre-Chorus]
You handsome devil

[Chorus]
Oh, let me get my hands
On your mammary glands
And let me get your head
On the conjugal bed
I say, I say, I say

[Verse 4]
There's more to life than books you know
But not much more
There's more to life than books you know
But not much more
Not much more

[Outro]
Oh, you handsome devil
Oh, you handsome devil
Oh

[Intro]
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
I can worry, I can overthink things
That's exactly when I tend to wanna drink things
Tend to wanna smoke things
'Til I realized there's no thing outside of me
That kinda helped me grow wings
Listen up, I think this is dope
To love's very different than to own
Let that sink in

[Verse 2]
I grew my hair, but never lost my J Dilla vibe
Airplane mode, don't kill the vibe
I had to remind people I was still alive
I had to remind people of what's real inside
Yeah, yeah, I'm the "I Took a Pill in" guy
But even more beautiful with no pill inside
Feel the vibe?

[Verse 3]
I wanted to be Deion, I was more Wojciechowski
My friends gon' hit the club, I tell 'em go without me
There's a lot that these people don't know about me
I always been that dude though, no Lebowski (Stupid)
Old friends never tell me that I seem different
Ashamed of the way that I used to treat women
Objectifying
Embarrassed, but I'll never lie
Mac is dead; many more are dead inside
Hideous thoughts in this head of mine
I'll choose different ones
Life hit me in the face, but I didn't run
Perhaps Michigan'll be the place my kids are from
Ram Dass is the man I got the vision from

[Interlude]
It's alright, yeah, uh
It's alright, yeah
Uh, ayy

[Verse 4]
I donated all my Jordans, didn't do a post
They were taking up the space that I needed to grow
That was a Sage Francis line; I stole it
But there was no better way to say that
There is no future, no time
Look at yourself; don't be so bovine
Courage used to be something that I couldn't find
People scared to look at their dreams so they look at mine, yeah
Whatever makes you feel good inside (It's alright)

[Outro]
I was in the gym the other day in Los Angeles
And I saw all of the beautiful bodies
Running on the treadmills, staring at the screens
And it reminded me of hamsters running on the wheel
And that's when I really decided right then and there
I'm not gon' be a hamster on a wheel
I'm gon' do it
Twitter is apoplectic
Squirrels with acorns
I said it before
Ships are safe in the harbor, but that ain't what ships are made for
I say I am not my haircut, I'm not my body
Not my clothes; I'm something much more beautiful
Deeper than even I know
Took me 30 years to wake up and write this song
Took me 30 years to realize nothing is wrong

[Verse 1]
Oh, I bet you think you're John Wayne
Showing up and shooting down everybody
You're classic in the wrong way
And we all know the end of the story

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause everyone knows someone who kills the buzz
Every time they open up their mouth
Yeah, everyone knows someone who knows someone
Who thinks they're cooler than everybody else

[Chorus]
And I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't ever gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse
You ain't ever gonna come down

[Bridge]
Darling, you take the high horse and I'll take the high road
If you’re too good for us, you’ll be good riding solo

[Verse 2]
I bet you think you're first place
Yeah, someone should give you a ribbon
And put you in the hall of fame
For all the games that you think that you're winning

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause everyone knows someone who kills the buzz
Every time they open up their mouth
Yeah, everyone knows someone who knows someone
Who thinks they're cooler than everybody else

[Chorus]
And I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't ever gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse
You ain't ever gonna come down

[Bridge]
Darling, you take the high horse and I'll take the high road
If you’re too good for us, you’ll be good riding solo

[Chorus]
Yeah, I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't ever gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse
You ain’t ever gonna come down

See this in 3D
'Fore life start for me
'Fore life start for me
Thoughts and thoughts to me
80 degrees
Warmin' up to me
I did it free
I did know, indeed
And I run out to sea
I can walk on the water
Honey, I want you
I can float on the finer
Father, hold me close
Don't let me down
I know you won't

[Verse: Kanye West]
I chose not to be a slave
Dropped the Wave Runners, now we run the wave
Like we ain't have all the hood rats in Mud Rats
Like you ain't had 'em, good stats and all that
Nobody gon' ruin me
I just called my wife up, let's get Hoover free
I put all my ice up and my Louis V
I just copped my momma crib, I'm back over East
Let me get your ear like Holyfield
From the home of Soldier Field
Coming home, that's how a soldier feels
All that killing over, that's just overkill
Yeezy back in the Chi, this that Oprah field

[Chorus: Kanye West]
See this in 3D
'Fore life start for me
'Fore life start for me
Thoughts and thoughts to me
80 degrees
Warmin' up to me
I did it free
I did know, indeed
And I run out to sea
I can walk on the water
Honey, I want you
I can float on the finer
Father, hold me close
Don't let me down
I know you won't

[Intro]
By the order of the Peaky Blinders
This is Red Right Hand by Snoop Shelby
Check it out

[Verse 1]
Take a little walk to the edge of town
And go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms
Like a bird of doom as it shifts and cracks
Where the secrets lie in the border fires
In the humming wires, yeah
Hey man, you know you're never coming back
I said you're never coming back
You know, you're never coming back
I said you're never coming back

So past the square, past the bridge
Past the mills, now past the stacks
On another gathering storm
Comes a tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat (say what?)
With a red right hand (say what, say what?)
Did you hear what I said?
In a dusty black coat
With a red right hand

[Verse 2]
He'll wrap you up in his arms
Tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all the dreams it took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole
Heal your shrinking soul
But there won't be a single thing that you can do
'Cause he's a god
He's a god, he's a man
He's a ghost, he's a guru
They're whispering his name
Through this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat
Is a red right hand
Yeah, red right hand

[Verse 3]
You don't have no money?
He'll get you some
You don't have a car? No car?
He'll get you one
You don't have no self-respect
You feel like an insect
Well don't you worry buddy
'Cause here he comes
Through the ghettos and the barrios
And the Bowery and the slums
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his red right hand
Stacks of green paper (yeah, money) in his red right hand

[Verse 4]
You'll see him in your nightmares
You'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere but
He ain't what he seems
You'll see him in your head
On the TV screen
And hey buddy, I'm warning you
Turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god
He's a man, he's a guru
You're one microscopic cog
In a catastrophic plan
Designed and directed
Directed, designed and directed
By his red right hand, yeah
Red right hand

[Intro: Kanye West]
Up from the ashes, into the sky
Found a Redeemer, how I survive
Boys hug their mothers, Mary and Christ
Your light has healed me, blessed with new life

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I could tell you, He could show you
God in Heaven, shinin' on you
Through your message, now I know you
I come to You empty, free of my pride

[Verse: Sunday Service Choir]
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Praise You only, now and forever
All the glory, it belongs to You
By Christ's power, we're victorious
Been set f—

[Refrain: Sunday Service Choir & Kanye West]
I come to You empty, free of my pride
We walk by faith and not by our sight
Declaring the vict'ry, one day at a time
God is our shepherd, light in the night
Cure for the sick, He's eyes for the blind

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I could tell you, He can show you
God in Heaven, shinin' on you
Through your message, now I know You
I come to You empty, free of my pride

[Outro: Kanye West]
I come to You empty

[Intro]
Father, I stretch
Stretch my hands to You

[Verse]
Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like typewrite
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike (Stretch my hands to You)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like" (Stretch my hands to You)
I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (Father, I stretch)
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life (Stretch my hands to You)
Arguing with my dad, and he said, "It ain't Christ-like"

[Outro]
Man
You know, it's like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your
I be on my
I woke up this morning, I said my prayers
I'm all doing good, I tried to talk to my dad (Stretch my hands to You)
Give him some advice, he starts spazzin' on me
I start spazzin' back, He said "That ain't Christ-like"
I said, "Ahhh"

[Intro]
Yo, Pi'erre, yo, Pi'erre

[Verse]
"How you get so much favor on your side?"
"Accept Him as your Lord and Saviour," I replied
Thou shalt love thy neighbor, not divide
I'ma ride, that's on God
His light shine the brightest in the dark
Single mothers know they got my heart
And all my brothers locked up on the yard
You can still be anything you wanna be
Went from one in four to one in three
Thirteenth amendment, gotta end it, that's on me
He the new commander and the chief
That's on Keef, that's on God
Before the ranch, I had horses in the garage
When the Forbes cover was just a mirage
They had me chasin' statues, that's on pride
"Oh my God," Bust said that's on Tribe
When I thought the Book of Job was a job
The Devil had my soul, I can't lie
Life gon' have some lows and some highs
Before the Grammy's ever gave a nod
I wore my heart on my sleeve, I couldn't hide
In '03, they told me not to drive
I bleached my hair for every time I could've died
But I survived, that's on God
I've been tellin' y'all since '05
The greatest artist restin' or alive
That's on L.A. Reid, that's on Clive
That's no Jive, that's on God
Off the 350s He supplied
The IRS want they fifty plus our tithe
Man, that's over half of the pie
I felt dry, that's on God
That's why I charge the prices that I charge
I can't be out here dancin' with the stars
No, I cannot let my family starve
I go hard, that's on God

[Outro]
(Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
Okay, okay, okay, okay

[Intro]
It's the ugliest nightmare born from the prettiest dreams

Use this gospel for protection
It's a hard road to Heaven
We call on Your blessings
In the Father, we put our faith

Our demons are tremblin'
Holy angels defendin'
In the Father, we put our faith

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
How could He not be the greatest?
In my bed, under covers when undercovers had raided
My presence is happy belated
Fashionably late, I'm just glad that you made it
The best is yet to come, I'm just glad that you waited
They all say they real 'til it's time to appraise it
I seen them come and go, you only the latest
But who am I to judge? I'm crooked as Vegas

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Use this gospel for protection
It's a hard road to Heaven
We call on Your blessings
In the Father, we put our faith
King of the kingdom
Our demons are tremblin'
Holy angels defendin'
In the Father, we put our faith

[Verse 2: No Malice]
A lot of damaged souls, I done damaged those
And in my arrogance, took a camera pose
Caught with a trunk of Barry Manilows
They sing a different tune when the slammer close
From the concrete grew a rose
They give you Wraith talk, I give you faith talk
Blindfolded on this road, watch me faith walk
Just hold on to your brother when his faith lost

Quit sellin' the pussy, don't want the fees at all

Bitches won't stop callin' my line
But I'm too busy turnin' water to wine
Lot on my mind, type of things happen all of the time
You gotta get yours, but me, I gotta get mine

If you lookin' for a king then you found one
Popped out of my mother placenta with a crown on
Got a new bitch, keep the frown on
She tell me I need to grow up
I tell her she need to get on my level and show respect to the motherfucker that's cuttin' the check
She ain't gonna be around long and that's fine
For now we naked on the couch, watchin' movies with the sound on this time
But never mind, that's another story
For a better time, when it's better for me
Cold dough burger, shit is 40
Might fuck around, pour a four in a 40
Now it's four in the mornin'
She out cold, sleepin' on the couch with her mouth wide, me, I'm still goin'
Fuck everybody but us
That's why I can't trust...

And I still think about that moment
All of the time
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh-ooh-ooh

You know that I could never make this up
I found the reason and I'm not givin' it up
I felt the fever, and I knew it was mine
Oh I'm gonna love you for a long time

[Chorus]
And in the mornin' when I'm waking up
I swear that you're the first thing that I'm thinkin' of
I feel it in my body
Know it in my mind, oh I
I'm gonna love you for a long time
I'm gonna love you for a long time
I'm gonna love you for a long time

[Verse 3]
Oh, I never knew it
Yeah you took me by surprise
While I was gettin' lost so deep inside your diamond eyes
So many things that I still want to say
And if devotion is a river
Then I'm floating away

[Chorus]
And in the mornin' when you pick me up
And all the world is quiet except the mourning dove
I feel it in my body
Know it in my mind, oh I
I'm gonna love you for a long time
I'm gonna love you for a long time
I'm gonna love you for a long time

[Bridge]
Don't slow down now
Come and break me down
Keep your hands in my hair
Keep your mouth on my mouth
Don't slow this down
Never let me go
Baby, don't you wanna see how far this thing can go?

[Chorus]
And in the mornin' when you wrap me up
I know that forever could never be enough
I feel it in my body
Know it in my mind, oh I
I'm gonna love you for a long time
I'm gonna love you for a long time
I'm gonna love you for a long time
For a long time
Oh, I'm gonna love you for a long time

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Can't wait to see your new body
Let the Lord of love be your new body
You've been born again in your new body
So it's on to get in your new body, woah

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
New walk, new talk, who that, who this?
Who else you know this bad, a few kids
Nobody nowhere, ever gave you this
Nobody flew to Colombia, like you did
Trying the new dress out with the new drip
Buying a new bag, first one to get
Nothing that you miss, is on your to-do list
And now you're intune with, divine influence
Old sins don't count, old fans might bounce
Told the devil, "Get behind me, I ain't ever gon' renounce"
Non-believers try to doubt, but we never go without
Mind, body, soul, who you think you dealing wit' now?
This a new chick, got a party table at the Ruth Chris
All God's children take a group pic
Turn the flash off 'cause we too lit
You used to twerk to every-every song
Get carded everywhere, look very, very young
New spirit new body, like Christ on the throne
All glory be to God, Hallelujah, carry on

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Can't wait to see your new body
Let the Lord of love be your new body
You've been born again in your new body
So it's on to get in your new body, woah

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
New body, rebirthing hard
Lord, I'd give my life to you, you deserve it all
Now when duty calls, I ain't perfect
I know sometimes I get weak, but it's worth it
You the one I big up, never give up
Only thing I'm tryna do is give them sins up
Look up at the scoreboard, I know that you won
It doesn't matter how they coming if they too young
'Cause every last one gon' be returning
And that's the message that we take from every sermon
That's why I'm turning to Your commandments
'Cause in the end I know You'll never leave me stranded (Ooh, yeah)

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Can't wait to see your new body (Your new body, oh yeah, oh yeah)
Let the Lord of love be your new body (Let the lord)
You'll be born again in your new body (Born again, born again)
So it's on to get in your new body, woah

[Chorus: Kanye West]
She's like that all the time
I always get on when she's on
She's like that all the time
I tell her she's right when she's wrong
Anything for a quiet night
'Cause she's always keeping it going
She's like that all the time
But I'll never leave her alone

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Oh
Man, this one for my old girl that stayed down
Even though I've been gone, she hold me down like I stay 'round (Right)
Been had her a new man but she still gon' come lay down (Oh God)
And bust it all night like a motherfucking Greyhound
And I know that you spend night after night
Sippin' liquor on liquor
Rolling with women on women
What's that? Bump bad bitches
But girl, you finer than your fine friends (Ooh)
Every time I bump into ya, I'm like, "Where the fuck the time went?"
I skrt skrt, then you climb in
And we catch up, yessir (Yeah)
I feel that dresser (Oh God)
And we talk about everything
Except who we dating, that ain't nece-
Necessary (Woah), fuck the life, she my secretary (Wow)
Ass and face is hereditary
Her mama, shit, legendary

[Chorus: Kanye West & Big Sean]
She's like that all the time
I always get on when she's on
She's like that all the time
I tell her she's right when she's wrong
Anything for a quiet night
'Cause she's always keeping it going
She's like that all the time
But I'll never leave her alone
Oh God, ooh

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
You got that hair long, I like that shit (Woah)
Titties hanging out, I like that shit (Woah)
Drama, I don't invite that shit
Text back, we really don't write that shit
Girl, I know you got options
You used to flying to islands (Go)
Dining Italian, what probably shopping with stylists
Stylists should just dress you naked
Shit, that's the best outfit (God)
Red light special but red light don't mean stopping
While we save sexy, lay texy
Rub or stretch me, caress me
Oh, good weed, no stress eat
I swear them times is the bestie
Girl, hell yeah
I feel like everybody got somebody like that
But no matter who you with, you still one night that
And no matter where you at, you just go right back
Right-right-right-right back

[Chorus: Kanye West with Big Sean]
She's like that all the time
I always get on when she's on
She's like that all the time
I tell her she's right when she's wrong
Anything for a quiet night
'Cause she's always keeping it going
She's like that all the time
But I'll never leave her alone

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Man it's crazy when you love someone you hate
And hate someone you love
But then just love someone you love
And you'll do anything for
And you don't even know, relationship
And all that hating shit, and all that complicated shit
And everything is just great 'cause you know girls get crazy
Crazy what? Like Jamaican or what?
Crazy like fucking Satan or what?
Crazy like the asylum, asylum, Salem
I don't know what I'm saying
I don't-I don't know what I'm saying
I don't-I don't know what I'm saying, man
You
Make everything brighter
You burn so hot
(ow ow ow)
Even the bravest firefighter
Would turn back
You
Make my heart lighter
My love for you
Will never tire
(ARTPOP)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything

[Chorus 1]
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP)

Take me to your planet (to the planet)
Take me to your planet (to the planet)

Cause you're out of this world
Galaxy, space and time
I wonder if this could be love
(Venus)

I been puttin' water on my fingers, I'm a seal
I been on the Forbes since 2012 (No cap)
I was just rockin' a brand new fox and it didn't come with a tail
I was just tellin' my bitch that call me soft, I got bells (Okay)
I just been rockin' this Gucci, I had my Giuseppes and Yeezys where I live
I got locked up and then I had to take the helicopter to LIV

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Turned to a Mothra, bro, this that Godzilla
Turned to a monster, more like Othello
Phantom of the opera, it goes where it goes
My nightmares still haunt me (Dream)
When I sleep, they haunt me
When I sleep, they haunt me (Ooh)
And my nightmares, they haunt me (Ooh ooh)
But I won't let 'em get the best of me

[Open Verse]

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Telling my brothers to stay calm, though
Turned to a Mothra, bro, this that Godzilla
Turned to a monster, more like Othello
Phantom of the opera, it goes where it goes
My nightmares still haunt me  (Dream)
When I sleep, they haunt me
When I sleep, they haunt me (Ooh)
And my nightmares, they haunt me (Ooh ooh)
But I won't let 'em get the best of me

[Verse 1: Tuki Carter]
Look, look
I make everyday my best day, I press play
It's my prerogative like Bobby Brown from back in the day
We Taylor like the chucks from back in the day for basketball play
I'm player, I got 7 basketball booties 24 hours a day
7 is a god number, 7 means strength
But it took you 7 days to find out you weak as a bitch
I'm wide open like the open ocean, keep your mind focused
(Keep your mind focused, keep your mind focused)
I got so high one day that I thought Monday was Saturday
I'm so Taylored I talk like 

[?] like NFL on Sunday
My 

[?] infinite like 

[?] jump in it
Sponsored by Reebok so you know there's a bump
In it
But I'm an artist, never starving, paint to carving

[?]
I got my eyes on the prize 

[?] like some 

[?]
I'm so cool, whipping through 

[?]
Tuki Carter's my name brand but I ain't happened over name brands
Don't stop it, I flex it, I cop it
It's Taylor Gang over everything like '02
It's Tuki 

[?] I don't know you, owe you

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Pull up stoned, my niggas at the pull up zone
Pulled out the cars, niggas pull out their phones
I'm tryna hit, baby first give me dome
We make the best of our time alone
What we do next, nobody know
Get my check then I gotta go
I'm in a new city, new state
Bout my money so I can't be too late
Roll a joint, take it to the face
I'm with a chick, don't even know her race
Question my gang, I say "We going places"
Don't have to play cause they know our faces
I got credit, nigga dead that shit
And I ain't worried bout the paper cause I get that shit
And ain't no point in looking back cause I'm ahead of you pricks
I'm getting cheddar and my whips is better and my bitch a ten
You ain't throwing up the gang then we don't comprehend
If we ain't come up from the mud then you not my friend
Either you got a pound of weed or you got some gin
I get it poppin' soon as the show's over, them draws dropping
They don't got to ask around, they just know I'm hot
I'm wheeling dirt bikes or somewhere smoking pot
Tripping on how close you got and got a culture shot

[Verse 1]
Where the north wind meets the sea
There's a river full of memory
Sleep, my darling, safe and sound
For in this river all is found
All is found
When all is lost, then all is found

[Verse 2]
In her waters, deep and true
Lie the answers and a path for you
Dive down deep into her sound
But not too far or you'll be drowned

[Verse 3]
She will sing to those who'll hear
And in her song, all magic flows
But can you brave what you most fear?
Can you face what the river knows?

[Verse 4]
Until the river's finally crossed
You'll never feel the solid ground
You had to get a little lost
On your way to being found

[Verse 5]
Where the north wind meets the sea
There's a mother full of memory
Come, my darling, homeward bound
Where all is lost, then all is found

[Outro]
All is found
All is found

[Verse 1]
Same
I'm the fucking man
Flacko be the name
From the gutter, pretty motherfucker
Fresh from out the state
Met a babe, with a pretty face
Swag from outer space
On the moon
How 'bout me and you when you go on a date
Watchu' say?
Me

[?]
Rips up on her jeans, kissing, sippin' lean
Black nails, 14 carat grills
Smilin make them gleam
Swagger mean
Say she 23 but lookin' 17 (fiend)

[Interlude]
*Moans*

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Smell the sex up in the air
Biting on the sheet
Fingers running thru her hair
Me and 4 bad bitches very fuckin' rare
Whisper in her ear, tell her what she want to hear
Hit it from the rear

[?] be the lean and pussy be the theme, make her scream
(The baddest hoes I ever fucked was European)
The baddest came from France
The other came from Spain
The other outta Germany she bought a extra friend
I don't recall her name but can't forget the way she came
The saddest thing about it is I will never fuck again
See fuckin' ain't a thang, see fuckin' is my game
That pretty motherfucker, I got fuck up in my name
I beat it out the frame
Your girlfriends love the train
I told them "If lives good I see you again some day"

[Incomplete]

[Verse 1]
Pollinate your love, pollinate your love
It's time for somethin'
I was in for long
I was in for long at night for some thing

[Chorus]
We're on the borderline
On the borrowed time we wasted one day
Possibly a sign
Gonna have the strangest night on Sunday

[Verse 2]
There I go
Quite a show for a loner in L.A
Asking how I managed to end up
In this place
And I couldn't get away

[Chorus]
I'm on the borderline, caught between the tides
Of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time, watched it speeding by
Like a train… like a train

[Refrain]
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?

Will I be known and loved?
Is it closer? Close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Set it free, must be tough

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
In this room, room for doubt
As within, as without

Will I be known and loved?
Gettin' closer, ta close enough?
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the sun

[Verse 3]
Pollinate your love, pollinate your love
It's time for somethin'
I said
"Can we go outside?" Need to bottle lies
And wait for somethin'
Do you see the light? Do you wonder why
They ain't respondin'?
Mexico in sight, oh, as we go inside
Oh no
And I couldn't get away

[Chorus]
We're on the borderline, gets me every time
These close encounters
Just to know I can, once again I am
Alone

[Refrain]
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?

Will I be known in love?
Gettin' closer, ta close enough?
I'm a loser, loosen up
Set it free, must be tough

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one?  That I trust
In this room, room for doubt
As within, as without
Will I be so in love?
Gettin' closer, ta close enough?
Shout out to what is done?
R.I.P., here comes the sun

[Chorus]
I want you the right way
I want you, but I want you to want me too
Want you to want me baby
Just like I want you
Da-da, da-da, da da-da

[Verse 1]
I'll give you all the love I want in return
But half a love is all I feel, sweet darling
It's too bad, it's just too sad
You don't want me anymore
But I'm going to change your mind
Some way, somehow

[Chorus]
I want you the right way
I want you, but I want you to want me too
Want you to want me baby
Just like I want you
Da-da, da-da, da da-da

[Verse 2]
One way love is just a fantasy
To share is precious, pure and fair
Don't play with something you should cherish for life
Oh baby, don't you want to care
Isn't it lonely out there

[Chorus]
I want you the right way
I want you, but I want you to want me too
Want you to want me baby
Just like I want you

I want you the right way
I want you, but I want you to want me too
Want me baby, just like I want you
Da da, da da, da da-da

[Outro]
I want you, the right way
Want me baby
Don't play with something you should cherish for life

[Verse 1]
All of my life I've tried so hard
Doing my best with what I had
Nothing much happened all the same

Something about me stood apart
A whisper of hope that seemed to fail
Maybe I'm born right out of my time
Breaking my life in two

[Chorus]
Throw me tomorrow
Now that I've really got a chance
Throw me tomorrow
Everything's falling into place
Throw me tomorrow
Seeing my past to let it go
Throw me tomorrow
Only for you I don't regret
That I was Thursday's child

[Post-Chorus]
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I cried my heart to sleep
Shuffling days and lonesome nights
Sometimes my courage fell to my feet

Lucky old sun is in my sky
Nothing prepared me for your smile
Lighting the darkness of my soul
Innocence in your arms

[Chorus]
Throw me tomorrow
Now that I've really got a chance
Throw me tomorrow
Everything's falling into place
Throw me tomorrow
Seeing my past to let it go
Throw me tomorrow
Only for you I don't regret
That I was Thursday's child

[Post-Chorus]
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
Thursday's child
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
Thursday's child

Yeah

Don't stop, don't quit, get a grip
Big Snoop Dogg coming through with the drip

Let me drop it, don't pop it, just stop it cause you know I gots to top it
Talk about no doubt
Hit you with the drip, Snoop Dogg's in the house

[Bun B]
Yo, Mike, it's Uncle Bun.
Yo, man, I just wanna congratulate you, man.
You know, this walk across America
It’s really ambitious, it's not gonna be easy
But it's absolutely possible.
You have everything you need inside of you to accomplish this.
You know, ’cause if you're going uphill, that means you get a view, you know?
So enjoy the view.
We love you, Mike, stay strong, and good luck.

[E-40]
Ayy, what's happening, Mike?
Man, what's happening with you, family?
This E-40, man.
Just, um, just wishing you well, man, on your journey, man, and
Whatever you do, don't, don't give up, brother.
Keep your head up, man.
'Preciate you, man.
Good luck with everything.
Much love. Four-oh, man.

Hi Michael, it's Mom.
What I want you to remember is to take care of yourself first.
That you can stop doing this if you want.
If it's not working out for you, or it's just too hard, or if you just decide it's too much.
You can take longer if you want, you can do it and stop...

[Intro]
...and start up again.
Um, I think it'll be an experience for you that you'll never forget.
Probably will be life-changing.
I think it's going to be very hard on your body.
I think you're gonna be, um, shocked at how difficult it is.
But I applaud you for trying it, I'm really excited for you.
And like Aunt Becky says, "Nobody gets hurt."
So just be safe, and I love you.

[Verse 1]
It's hard to explain what I got the vision for
It's almost like I'm tryna sing a hidden note
And I can't even get it out, though it's it my throat
I get so frustrated, I feel like a misanthrope
I start feeling like my whole life isn't dope
And I've ruined everything with what I didn't know
Then some shit my father told me starts hitting home
What the fuck am I even here livin' for?
I miss my friends, we don't talk as much as we used to
I'm too busy checking on YouTube and scrolling on IG
I tend to get glued to various distractions as my life floats by
Have I just been checked out the whole time?
I spend 85% of it online
And for the things that really matter I got no time (No time)
But wait, if I can get myself out of this broke mood
Then maybe all my listeners could have hope too
Yeah, that's what I'm gon' do
I become who I am from all the shit I go through

[Chorus]
Keep walkin'
If I could write my name across the sky for all to see, then I would
If I could bring myself to understand what you are, then I would
And I would if I could, if I could, then I would
And I would if I could, if I could, then I would
And I would if I could, if I could, then I would
And I would if I could, if I could, then I would, and I would

[Verse 2]
I'm a butterfly flyin' through a broken sky
God servin' me truth, and I'm open wide
It takes courage to be still and go inside
I'm on a tip of liberation, watch me toe the line
When yoga pose hits a yoga pose
A part of me that I really hate showin' shows
You get a taste from my post of quotes
But my inner growth is something no one knows
And I hope it shows
In my eyes, in my music, in my vibe, in my kindness
And in my stride, in the grand art piece that is my life
And again, this is just a brush stroke
You've been running long enough, child, come home
Break it down, universe means one song
You wanna taste life, swim into the unknown
I know that I did my best
I'm not designed to eat, sleep, sit, and text
My thirty-first year is a vision quest
I know the answer that I'm lookin' for isn't sex
And it isn't money, isn't fame
It's something much deeper than I can explain
And this verse is just a finger pointin' toward the trail
Soon you gonna have to walk it for yourself

[Chorus]
Keep walkin'
If I could write my name across the sky for all to see, then I would
If I could bring myself to understand what you are, then I would
And I would if I could, if I could, then I would
And I would if I could, if I could, then I would
And I would if I could, if I could, then I would
And I would if I could, if I could, then I would, and I would

[Outro]
If you could give a wish to future Mike when he sets off on his walk in a few months, what would that be?
I wish you remember this is what you wanted.
This is, this is what you wanted.
I understand intellectually there are gonna be terrible moments on this journey
Where I wanna give up, where my body hurts, where I'm thinking
"Why the heck did I choose to do this? This was so stupid."
And the reason you chose to do it
Was to feel what you're feeling right now
And decide to keep going

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Tweakin', tweakin' off that TCB, huh

See, this the type of high that won't come down
This the type of high that get you gunned down
Yeezy, Yeezy trollin' low-key, huh

Thinkin' what if that happened to me too
Then I'm on E! News

[Chorus]
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself

[Verse 2]
Ayy, hospital bed a hundred bands, fuck a watch
Hundred grand'll make your best friends turn to opps
Everybody bringin' my name up a lot
I guess I just turned the clout game up a notch
See, y'all really shocked, but I'm really not
You know how many hoes I took to the titty shop?
If she get the ass with it, that's a 50-pop
I still bring the baddest bitches in the city out
Just a different kind of leader
We could be in North Korea, I could smoke 'em, Wiz Khalifa, ugh
Told my wife I've never seen her
Once I hit it, bye Felicia, that's the way that I'ma leave it up

[Chorus]
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
See, this is why all the bitches fuck with Ye!
Fuck what they talking 'bout!
Sometimes, I scare myself, myself
They take me on meds, off meds—ask yourself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Ask your homegirl right now, "Look, you had a shot at Ye?"
Sometimes, I scare myself, myself
You'd drop everything! This why, this why

[Verse 3]
Tweakin', tweakin' off that 2C-B, huh
This is why your bitches fuck with me, huh
Wake up, she gon' end up on TV, huh
She gon' want that thing, won't fuck for free, huh
Someone gonna sign up for that lease, huh
She gon' have the son for deans now
Forward looking, she out at me, huh
Thought they wouldn't make it like their memes, huh
Faces I be making like a memes, huh
She want her shorty to be a meme now
I'ma give them something they can see now
Man, this ain't as bad as it seems, now
Man, it ain't as bad as it seems, huh
They wan happen to me, now
Brother, I been this way since I was knee high
Going Tom Cruise and Charlie Sheen now
My parents said I was a mistake, and a disgrace
Rake rake, fake watch, that's a wrist-grace

[Verse 1]
Oh, I'm getting mine how I'm supposed to be
You ain't a day one so you ain't getting close to me, no
You see that everything frozen, bank account foreign
Everybody good 'cause I've been going in
I'm smoking paper planes posted
In a brand new country but I'm leaving in the morning
And the pack just flown in
If you don't inhale you ain't really getting stoned then
See I can roll, but I put it in a cone
Big long, put it in a bong
Used to smoke one, now it take three to get me in the zone
Take joints to the dome
And you should be there on the road with me
I got a pound of KK that is grown for me
Everywhere I go I'm smoking weed
Ain't just me, that's for everyone that rolls with me

[Chorus]
Don't know what they want from me
No, I don't really know what they want from me
Don't know what they want from me
No, I don't really know what they want from me
I'ma party 'til I can't no more
Wake up in the morning, get stoned
Don't know what they want from me
No, I don't really know what they want from me

[Verse 2]
Now my team on top
They be waiting for us to but I promise that we ain't gon' stop
We got the game on lock
Walking to the plane we smelling like a pound of that Mary Jane
Learned the rules to the game
Now we make our own, now we getting dome
Now we getting good
Start a 

[?], now we getting grown
Top floor but we got it out the mud though
I remember we couldn't get in the club
Now they run up to us and show us nothing but love
Lost some niggas, a few of them we don't trust
But this the papers too so roll two of 'em up
And we gon' work hard, we gon' stack ours
We gon' grind for it everyday and never slack off
And we gon' be the ones they ask for
When it's all said and done, it'll be the gang moving past y'all

[Chorus]
Don't know what they want from me
No, I don't really know what they want from me
Don't know what they want from me
No, I don't really know what they want from me
I'ma party 'til I can't no more
Wake up in the morning, get stoned
Don't know what they want from me
No, I don't really know what they want from me
Don't know what they want from me
No, I don't really know what they want from me
Don't know what they want from me
No, I don't really know what they want from me
I'ma party 'til I can't no more
Wake up in the morning, get stoned
Don't know what they want from me
No, I don't really know what they want from me
Intro
Late night, leave the crib, just for that
Uh, I roll me a doobie, I watch me a movie
Thats what a real nigga do
Adidas slides on, I ain't paying all that money for no Gucci shit
For real

Verse 1
Uh, I roll me a doobie, I watch me a movie
Shorty get choosy, I told her to moon me
I’m right where the pool be, her mouth get drooly
Now you can't school me, I rap with my foolies
My diamonds like kool-aid, we down and your crew ain't
Been grindin for 2 days, sometimes I don’t do sleep
She tell me its too late, she said she don't do face
Count nothing but blue face, all white on my shoelace
Some niggas say they real, but really they fake tho
Don't do what they say bro, that's just how the game go
Ain't worried bout no bitch, I'm stacking a bankroll
Some niggas they hate though, I'm doing my thing though
Some niggas'll talk shit, but ain’t how I’m living my life
Stay making them highlights, cause my nigga you don't die twice
I rap with my day ones, got a problem then say something
I don’t wait till my day come, want a million then make one
?, ain't no pay cut
My bitch bad soon as she wake up, ain't no makeup
Living the life when I was younger, I only dreamed of
Now when I pull up, got my shirt off, I keep it gangster
Now all my niggas riding with me, and rolling dank up
I keep a bad bitch with me, a money maker
And with you fuck with her, she a heartbreaker
And if she got a bad friend, we all neighbors

[Verse 1]
Nigga what time it is, time to go get some money and fuck these hoes
I'm stackin' up and hussling fa-sho
Changin' the game when I came in the door
Niggas was lame so I came with the dope
Doin' some things that you ain't seen before
Remember them days when I slept on the floor
Now we hit the hotel and we get the whole floor
Walk in the bank smell the dank on my clothes
Makin' more change than you think I'm supposed to
Been round the world but I still be out local
One of the best and I'm just being vocal
Clean up good like soap do
Make you feel good like soul food
Them fuck niggas they old news
Got a old car with new shoes
Niggas don't test cause I give em the blues
I'm in love with my music, try to boss up don't get comfortable too
Blowin' kush where my roof is, bad bitch where my room is
I'm high where the moon is, we winnin' not losin'
Whatever you do just

[Chorus]
Don't stop ever lovin' me
Don't stop ever lovin' me
Don't stop ever lovin' me
Don't stop ever lovin' me

[Verse 2]
I needed it I bought it and worked hard for it
But won't forget the days when I couldn't afford it
Just put me in the game, I ain't gone ever forfeit
My son in private school, I gotta pay the mortgage
Them niggas talkin' shit, to me that ain't important
I'm ridin' foreign whips, that means them things imported
You on the internet, this shit you say recorded
You hangin' round them snitches, that mean you can't report it
I'm tryna fall asleep, soon as my plane get boarded
Them niggas can't hate, the police can't get warrants
I'm buyin' real estate, that mean my bank enormous
My diamonds real yours fake, that mean you can't ignore it
I need a bigger plate, make sure my steak is on it
That KK got you buzzed, it make you think of hornets
Ferrari's, Porsche's, all these horses
You dreamin, we livin', the sky is the limit

[Chorus]
Don't stop ever lovin' me
Don't stop ever lovin' me
Don't stop ever lovin' me
Don't stop ever lovin' me

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
What you niggas talkin' bout, seen it before
Come to my crib smell the weed at the door
Hustler hard real G in my pores
It's a game to you while to me it's a sport
Gettin' paid since I came off the porch
Niggas fake so it ain't no remorse
Treat the bank like a obstacle course
Runnin' through account money need more
Use my brain so I don't need force
Love to drive fast so my car need horses
Cameros, Ferraris, Porsches
The bitch that I'm with, she gorgeous
To lift my money up need a forklift
Don't even hit me up, you ain't important
Fingerprint where my door is, kk got me out in orbit
She ain't mine, that's your bitch
Niggas askin what the score is
That mean they losin, I'm up with my alarm I don't never snooze
You ain't walkin in my shoes
And if I say do it then my niggas say do it too
And if I roll up then my niggas roll up too
Pourin shots at the party cause you don't know what we been through
Ever since I was young went to ball nigga no hoop

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
We ain't dangerous, we ain't dangerous, no
There's just no changing us, no changing us, no
We ain't dangerous, we ain't dangerous, no
There's just no changing us, no changing us, no
We ain't dangerous, we ain't dangerous, no
There's just no changing us, no changing us, no
We ain't dangerous, we ain't dangerous, no
There's just no changing us, no changing us, no

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Drop the top in the rain, we gon' fuck it up
Earned everything I own, got the gold touch
Love the game, miss my old life so much
But I wouldn't trade it, ain't in no rush
Learned niggas gon hate, so it's no trust
For the k spent nine weeks on the bus
It ain't just me dog, it's more of us
I don't do it for the fame, do it for the love
She can't live without me, say it's like a drug
We ain't spendin' money on it if it's out the budget
Stay to myself keep my business out the public
You ain't talkin' money dog I ain't with the subject
The real wanna see me win, fake niggas upset
You been pullin' all them stunts, ain't get a buzz yet
Young Khalifa he the GOAT, he that nigga, nuff said
Anytime I get a plate, make sure everyones fed

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
We ain't dangerous, we ain't dangerous, no
There's just no changing us, no changing us, no
We ain't dangerous, we ain't dangerous, no
There's just no changing us, no changing us, no
We ain't dangerous, we ain't dangerous, no
There's just no changing us, no changing us, no
We ain't dangerous, we ain't dangerous, no
There's just no changing us, no changing us, no

It's real, all dreams real
My boy text me, he told me, "Dream big"

[Interlude: Ant Clemons]
Like the cars that we own now, 'member we used to lease it
Now we undefeated, look at what the team did

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
All dreams are real
All dreams, real (Real)
All dreams, real

[Verse 1: Ant Clemons]
Spirit of Coltrane with us
Old slang, you know the old sayin'
Ho's saying, "He sold out," out the stores, mane
I like soul beats and pj's, I'm so plain
Opps crowded around my house like I was Houssein
Came and grabbed me out my house like I was insane
Doc sayin', "There's somethin' wrong with his membrane"
I've been sufferin' from lack of sleep, bitch, I been drained
Gotta high type of tolerance for that type of pain
Pour some, I wan' go numb 'till it's okay
Here we go, I'm off the drink and now we in things
We was lowkey, heard you wanted to avenge things
We approached, we ain't gon' make it 'till the endgame
Guess that's just what he got to do to get the rent paid
I ain't gon' hate on no man to get a bill paid
Bills ain't the real pain, the real pain is real pain
Your self-hate, self-doubtin', fake love
But

[Chorus: Ant Clemons & Kanye West]
All dreams, real (Real)
It's that no limitations, babe
All dreams, real (Real)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Yeah, 'Ye cold
But that Trump hat forced me to feel like I like J. Cole, damn
My own city turned they back on me
They thought I told Push about Drake's son, goddamn
Like I ain't want them to run, goddamn
I guess they fall and they dumb, goddamn
I don't care about his son, goddamn
I just rap about me, goddamn
Niggas can't resist publicity for free, goddamn
Always wantin' somethin' like it isn't me, goddamn
Everytime, I rap it, this ain't charity, goddamn
Energy that never die, energy that stay alive
Energy, the synastry I'm finna see a synesthesia
I could see ya, color feel ya
Bona feature, extra features
I'm allegiant, all the deats, all the features
And the teachers and the preachers
They could reach us on the feature
All the leaches, all my features
I was just in the bleachers
Jump the bleachers, I'm a thesis
That's my thesis, Holy Jesus
Um

[Chorus: Kanye West]
All dreams, real (Real)
All dreams, real (Real)

[Outro: Kanye West]
"Gotta let 'Ye be 'Ye"

You try send a message, I don't get it at all
See my new girl, tryna tell me she not the one
Baby girl you gone have to love me from a distance
I tried to teach you everything I know but you ain't listen
Riding in my whip alone thinking bout what's missing

We've been doing good since we met
Girl it feels so good when we sex
Usually I move to the next
Got a few but with you it's the best
You don't care about the jewels on my neck
Give me love plus the rules you respect
Hear 'em talk, you ain't too into that
All that ass, what you doing with that?
It's true I rap and it's true that I stack
If you show me love, promise you'll get it back
You show me the real thing, you'll get it back
Show me I'm the only one, you'll get it back
Due to the fact

[Chorus: 24hrs + (Wiz Khalifa)]

It's hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of stayin' above the risin' water line

[Chorus]
Well the sky has finally opened

You hold tight to your umbrella
Darlin', I'm just tryna tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella

So tie up the boat, take off your coat, and take a look around
Everything is alright now

'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
Hold tight to your umbrella
Darlin', I'm just tryna tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head
Yeah, there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

He wanna ride on a horse, he need to give me the keys to a Porsche
I told him until you finish your dinner, I cannot let you leave off of the porch
Boy, let me butter your corn on the cob
We give each other more neck than a bob
He like to put a little oil on my ass
Before he record so I feel like a star, huh

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
When the revolution come, you can see me on the front line
Firing my gun, standing right beside my son
If I go, it's understood that I stood for something
When my whole life, they told me, I was good for nothing
I was raised by the stray dogs, blazed off, layed off
Breaking laws, graveyard shifting every day war
Focus now, notice how, things change, soldier
I remain the same, I'm older now, I embrace the pain
I blame the struggle, nearly drove me insane
Thought I lost my head, till my brethren told me the same
No tears for the reaper, I've buried bout a thousand
In graffiti, "rest in peace" sprayed off throughout the housing
I tried to stay civilized, the hood's a prison inside
The only difference is the doors don't slide
Still we trapped in the animal cage, cause we got animal ways
So we react, with the animal rage
And my section's real, weapons peel, cheddar's the deal
Seen the depths of hell, now I stare, death in the grill
From the slave ships, to today's bricks, same shit
I'm awake, to the wickedness, and one, with the pavement

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
The all great mind stays divine, my hands remain deadly
We shine without the hung jewelry, produce light
That'll travel through mics, now as the time riping
We took words that we nourishing, encouraging
A nation to awaken, those who were sleeping
Can you conceive the thought? Transatlantic import
Slave and bought, secret relations between blacks and Jews
Might set a fuse off in the head
Many dead lynch hung, swung from trees
Brothers in the struggle together, eat from one pot
Hold each other down to the sneaker
Nothing come between us
Fast money and chicks, did it to the best of cliques
It's sickening... huh

[Hook: Masta Killa]
It's me and you son, forever in the struggle
No doubt, we hustle, survival is the motto
Will you soon follow, a better tomorrow
...For a better tomorrow
It's me and you son, forever in the struggle
No doubt, we hustle, survival is the motto
Will you soon follow, a better tomorrow
...For a better tomorrow

[Verse 3: GZA]
I catch a few flashbacks about, going through the struggle
How we used to make dollars, from all the snow we shoveled
In a broke neighborhood, where the kids often dream
About a lavish life, that is mostly seen in the screen
Where some dreams are quickly cut short, due to gang violence
From loud guns, that kept witnesses, in deep silence
Was it bad timing? Jealousy from too much shining?
Or a set up, from a girl that he wined, kept dining
It's a known fact, they will attack, cause it's like that
And depending on the, kind of impact, that strike back
In a town where the talk is cheap and, beef is brief
A mother sobs uncontrollably, and exhibit the grief
Large holes in the front door, of a housing tenement
Allows room to retaliate, so conflict is imminent
This hate in the brain, destroys the cells like cancer
Even experts are stuck with more questions than answers

[Hook: Masta Killa]
It's me and you son, forever in the struggle
No doubt, we hustle, survival is the motto
Will you soon follow, a better tomorrow
Make the way for a better tomorrow
It's me and you son, forever in the struggle
No doubt, we hustle, survival is the motto
Will you soon follow, a better tomorrow
Make the way for a better tomorrow

[Intro]
Hey yeah, hey yeah

[Chorus]
Well, I just need a little space, I can be my own me
Yeah, I'm just givin' you a taste
It's some one and only, this that one and only
Yeah, I got what you need, what you need, what you need
Shit, you know how it be, how it be, how it be, yeah
All I ever needed was some one and only, this that one and only

[Verse 1]
Well, hello, good evenin'
I'm with you long as I'm breathin'
For every season, my girl, she keep on keepin' me decent
I'm workin', not takin' weekends
I barely got time for sleepin'
Searchin' for meanin', fiendin' for freakiness
How it's bein', shit
I been the coldest, since winter solstice, mmm
I had a soul, I know that shit is frozen, mmm
Out of control, I am a livin' moment, mmm
I got that dopamine, know if you want it, yeah
Feel like I'm runnin' out of time, a couple days behind
This shit that's runnin' through my mind
There ain't no way I'm fine
And maybe I'm just wastin' time
Sick of playin' games, get out my gymnasium
I am a collector, of money and pressure
There's nobody better, out of my skull, I'm Hannibal Lecter
Yes sir, killin' all the noise
You know how it go; first you build it, then destroy

[Chorus]
Well, I just need a little space, I can be my own me (I can be my own me, own me)
Yeah, I'm just givin' you a taste
It's some one and only, this that one and only (Only)
Yeah, I got what you need, what you need, what you need (Got what you need)
Shit, you know how it be, how it be, how it be, yeah (That's how it be)
All I ever needed was some one and only, this that one and only

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
Okay, scatter brain, scatter brain
On my own island, I'm a castaway, who rackin' up these accolades?
You already know, so I don't have to say
I'm comin' up with words just like a motherfuckin' Scrabble game
Don't put out my wildfire (Wild), wildfire (Wild)
Take me up a mile higher, a mile higher (Mile)
Talkin' shit, we outside, we outside
I'm makin' motherfuckin' classics in my downtime (Yeah)
I'm a giant, how the fuck you talkin' down to me?
This that shit that make a hater raise up out they seat
And I can't see you from my balcony
I'm in the clouds and you lookin' like the ground to me
Yeah, told 'em already, I tell 'em again
I'ma keep killin', I'm livin' until I'm a hundred and ten (Woo)
Yeah, invincible, this shit is never gon' end
So tell a friend to tell a friend
Who tell a friend, who tell a friend

[Chorus]
Well, I just need a little space, I can be my own me (I can be my own me, own me)
Yeah, I'm just givin' you a taste
It's some one and only, this that one and only (Only) (Woo)
Yeah, I got what you need, what you need, what you need (Got what you need)
Shit, you know how it be, how it be, how it be, yeah (That's how it be)
All I ever needed was some one and only, this that one and only

[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah
This is everything you dreamed of, isn't it? (Isn't it?)
Now that you here, why does it feel so different? (Uh-huh)
I bet you feelin' so infinite (Uh-huh)
And you don't gotta worry 'bout shit again (Shit again) (Woo)
Yeah, brand new crib, who let all these bitches in?
Fuck it, if they fine, then it's fine, we just kickin' it (Woo)
Get the weed, grab a glass, pour some liquor in
Everybody got the devil in 'em just a little bit

[Verse 1]
Oh, used to be so innocent
Used to study everyday, get nothin' but some A's
'Til the money never came
Oh, what a shame, isn't it? (Isn't it? Isn't it?)
This shit feel just like some good pussy
Those days that you skipped school playin' hooky
This shit feel like some head in the middle of the day
Get you wet, got you singin' in the rain
I'm just sayin', let me stunt a bit, stunt a bit (Bit)
I'm just havin' fun with it, I'm drunk as shit
My bitch stayin' sober, so I'm lettin' her drive
While I'm in the passenger seat
Like, "How the fuck this shit happen to me?"
I wished I cared, I don't give a shit, aware I'm a citizen
Are you there, are you listenin'?
It ain't a light if it's flickerin'
You see, I just wanna shine, see Mr. Fisherman

[Chorus]
Yeah
This is everything you dreamed of, isn't it? (Isn't it?)
Now that you here, why does it feel so different? (Uh-huh)
I bet you feelin' so infinite (Uh-huh)
And you don't gotta worry 'bout shit again (Shit again)
Yeah, brand new crib, who let all these bitches in?
Fuck it, if they fine, then it's fine, we just kickin' it (Woo)
Get the weed, grab a glass, pour some liquor in
Everybody got the devil in 'em just a little bit

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I told myself, once I hold my own checks
That I would go and buy myself a gold Rolex
I was sayin', "Oh yes," but I don't know yet
They told me, "Take it slow, homie, don't flex" (Don't stress)
And all you lil' bitches, you don't pose no threat
See, I've been around for years, I'm a Most Dope vet
I be stone cold stuntin'
Gotta know, don't guess (Don't guess)
I don't hear none of y'all, I'm so, so deaf (Woo)
Homie, you just gotta let it go, don't stress (Stress)
I just wanna smoke a little weed and have sex (Sex)
When I hit it from behind, see, I make that ass stretch
Only fuck with tens, yo' bitch got bad breath
All I do is get high and cash checks
Call a bitch over, MapQuest the address
Access the mattress, that pussy mad wet
Gimmie head, crack necks
Heard she a ho, we gon' know when we fact check
She like to call me daddy, probably 'cause her dad left
The science don't know what I am, they runnin' lab tests
Got a long way to go, a lot of gas left
Rather have more than have less
I'm in the booth rappin', I'm gettin' mad head
Wanna put it in her pussy and she tell me that's next
I don't fear nothin', I don't even fear death
Keep goin' 'til, 'til my last breath

[Chorus]
This is everything you dreamed of, isn't it? (Isn't it?)
Now that you here, why does it feel so different? (Uh-huh)
I bet you feelin' so infinite (Uh-huh)
And you don't gotta worry 'bout shit again (Shit again)
Yeah, brand new crib, who let all these bitches in?
Fuck it, if they fine, then it's fine, we just kickin' it (Woo)
Get the weed, grab a glass, pour some liquor in
Everybody got the devil in 'em just a little bit

[Verse 3]
Yeah
I do it hippo large, spit those bars
'Bout a quarter million, I whip those cars
Bein' rich so hard, sniff those bars
And it seem like every time I make a hit go yard
My bitch in love with my dick so far
She love to swallow, said, "This shit low carb"
You better sit right down, this shit gon' start
Because this my town, it's Pittsburgh park
All the drugs I did so far
I'm just hopin' that my dick get hard

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Ghetto man your mind is cloudy
You know they know no one really loves you
I know that life's incidental
But you must be strong
Focus the mental
Is it precious

[Chorus]
Ghetto man now don't you know
Someday we all have to go
Careful of the path you choose
To escape these ghetto blues

[Verse 2]
Ghetto man you try and try
Even when the fire burning at your hands

But I'm gonna fight
Til' they take me home

[Chorus]
Ghetto man now don't you know (don't you know)
Someday we all have to go (got to go)
Careful of the path you choose (careful)
To escape these ghetto blues

[Bridge]
Born and raised in ghetto streets
Seems like all there is to life
Loneliness even with a million people by my side
Dreams are born and fade away
Cause it's me against the world
Time to make a change

[Chorus]
Ghetto man now don't you know
Someday we all have to go
Careful of the path you choose
To escape these ghetto blues

[Chorus]
Ghetto man now don't you know
Someday we all have to go
Careful of the path you choose
To escape these ghetto blues

In these ghetto streets
In these ghetto times
All the things we need
All the things we need

[Outro: MuMs da Schemer]
I came upon the corner

Just so that I came there to you
If I couldn't find you there
What in the world am I to do?

And I won't deceive you
So can't we try
To make it just like what we dreamed?

Than to give you all that you desire
To make your world a little brighter
There is nothing that I would not do

'Cause you, you make me realize true love (Crazy world of mine)
And I, I will make sure that it lasts (Crazy world of mine)

You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Boy, we couldn't get much higher

[Chorus]
Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Come on set this night on fire

The time to hesitate is through
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now, we can only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

[Chorus]
Come on now baby
Hey hey hey
Light my fire

[Chorus]
Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm lovin' it, I'm lovin' it, I'm lovin' it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Can you feel me now?
(Can you feel me now? Can you feel me now?)

[Chorus]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under

Slowly, it's taking over me (Taking over me, taking over me)

It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?

Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me
It's not that I don't wanna stay
But every time you come too close, I move away

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me, move slow
There's things about me you just have to know

[Chorus]
Sometimes I run, sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night
Baby, all I need is time

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna be so shy, oh, oh
Every time that I'm alone, I wonder why
Hope that you will wait for me
You'll see that you're the only one for me

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me, move slow
There's things about me you just have to know

[Chorus]
Sometimes I run, sometimes, sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night
All I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night
Baby, all I need is time

[Bridge]
Just hang around and you'll see
There's nowhere I'd rather be
If you love me, trust in me
The way that I trust in you

[Chorus]
Sometimes I run, sometimes, sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you, ooh
But all I really want is to hold you tight (Hold you tight)
Treat you right, be with you day and night (Day and night)
Sometimes I run, sometimes, sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you, ooh
But all I really want is to hold you tight
I'll treat you right, I'll be with you day and night
All I really want is to hold you tight
Be with you day and night
Sometimes I run, sometimes, sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight

[Intro]
Oh, my love
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm sitting here alone up in my room
I'm thinking 'bout the times that we've been through, oh, my love
I'm looking at a picture in my hand
Trying my best to understand
I really wanna know what we did wrong
With a love that felt so strong

[Pre-Chorus]
If only you were here tonight
I know that we could make it right

[Chorus]
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only within my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy

[Verse 2]
I know I've been a fool since you've been gone
I'd better give it up and carry on, oh, my love
'Cause living in a dream of you and me
Is not the way my life should be
I don't wanna cry a tear for you
So forgive me if I do (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
If only you were here tonight
I know that we could make it right

[Chorus]
I don't know how to live without your love

I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy

[Bridge]
(Oh yeah)
I'd do anything
I'd give you my world
I'd wait forever to be your girl (Just call out my name)
Just call out my name (And I will be there) and I will be there (Ooh)
Just to show you how much I care (Alright, ooh)
I was born to make you happy, yeah (Ooh, ooh yeah)

I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one within my heart

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Na-na-na, na-na-na

[Verse 1]
"Never look back," we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?
Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind
Where do I go?
And you didn't hear
All my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you know still I miss you somehow?

[Chorus]
From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love
I never knew love 'til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

[Verse 2]
"Baby," I said, "Please stay
Give our love a chance for one more day"
We could've worked things out
Taking time is what love's all about
But you put a dart
Through my dreams, through my heart
And I'm back where I started again, yeah
Never thought it would end

[Chorus]
From the bottom of my broken heart (My broken heart)
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love
I never knew love 'til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

[Bridge]
You promised yourself
But to somebody else
And you made it so perfectly clear
Still I wish you were here

[Chorus]
From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
(a thing or two I'd like you to know)
(You were my first love)
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
(You were my real love) You were my real love
I never knew love 'til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

[Outro]
"Never look back," we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?

[Verse 1]
I used to think
I had the answers to everything
But now I know
Life doesn't always go my way, yeah
Feels like I'm caught in the middle
That's when I realized

[Chorus]
I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
All I need is time
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between

[Verse 2]
I'm not a girl (I'm not a girl)
I'm not a girl
There is no need to protect me
It's time that I (I)
Learn to face up to this on my own
I've seen so much more than you know now
So don't tell me to shut my eyes

[Chorus]
I'm not a girl (Not a girl, not yet a woman)
Not yet a woman
(I'm just trying to find the woman in me)
All I need is time
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between

[Bridge]
I'm not a girl (I'm not a girl)
I'm not a girl
But if you look at me closely
You will see it in my eyes
This girl will always find her way

[Chorus]
I'm not a girl
I'm not a girl, don't tell me what to believe
Not yet a woman
I'm just trying to find the woman in me, yeah
(All I need is time) all I need is time
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl (Not a girl, not yet a woman)
Not yet a woman
(I'm just trying to find the woman in me)
Not now
All I need is time
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl

I'm Miss American Dream since I was 17
Don't matter if I step on the scene or sneak away to the Philippines
They're still gon' put pictures of my derriere in the magazine
You want a piece of me? (You want a piece of me?)
I'm Miss Bad Media Karma, another day, another drama

Well, get in line with the paparazzi who's flipping me off
Hoping I'll resort to some havoc, end up settling in court
Now, are you sure you want a piece of me? (You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. 'Most Likely to Get on the TV For Slippin' on the Streets When Gettin' the Groceries' - now, for real, are you kiddin' me?
No wonder there's panic in the industry, I mean, please
You want a piece of me? (Me, me)

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Yeah, this the real one, baby
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
London, stand up!
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside
We gon' set this party off right
We set this party off right or what?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Okay, that's it

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, "I'll just stay down hurr and do hair"
That's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
Had hair so long that it looked like weave
She cut it all off, now she look like Eve
She dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Everybody say, "All falls down"
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Let me hear you sing
And when it falls down
Oh, when it all

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this (For real)
Just to be like, "Nigga, you ain't up on this"
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean, a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our forty acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, everybody say, "All falls down"
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
I can't hear you!
And when it all falls down
Oh, when it all

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I say, "–– the police," that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', "Where the ballers at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And George Bush get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
Fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Yeah, now everybody say
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Now let me hear you say
And when it all falls down
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Let's go, let's go, lemme hear you say
One more time, one more time
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
From the front to the back, say
And when it all falls down

[Chorus: Brandy]
I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
One day, they'd tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down

[Verse: Kanye West]
We goin' to Mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say
'Fore Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that'll shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better
Than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he-say, she-say
Your girl don't like me, how long has she been gay?
Spanish girls say, "Yo, no hablo inglés"
And everybody want to run to me for their single
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you, I'd kill myself
Made a mil' myself and I'm still myself
And I'ma look in the mirror if I need some help
Now I'll speak from the heart, y'all all frontin'
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel something

[Bridge: Brandy & Kanye West]
What you calling?
(Feel something, feel something)
I let all in for getting what some get will get ya
(Feel something, feel something
Feel something, feel something)
What kind of dream we found?
See, I'm often catching crosswinds
Forgetting where the hell I met you
And try to bring me down

[Chorus: Brandy]
I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
One day, they'd tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down

[Outro: Brandy]
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

[Intro: Otis Redding & Kanye West]
Wished I had told, ooh, was the only one
But it's too late (Uh-oh)
It's too late
He's gone

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Consequence]
You sweat her, and I ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi
You a big L, and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
(Brother Numpsay!) Groupies say I'm too choosy
Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies
Say she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays, I still have it my way, gone

[Chorus 1: Cam'ron, Kanye West, Both]
We striving home (Yeah)
I ride on chrome

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Y'all don't want no prob' from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn?
Caught something on the Usher tour, he had to let it burn
Plus, he already got three chil'r'n
Arguin' over babysitters like, "Bitch, it's your turn"
"Damn, Ye, it'd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is super-official"
R-R-R-Roc Pastelle with Gucci on
With TVs in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap, I'm at the top with Doobie Long
'Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on, gone

[Chorus 2: Cam'ron, Kanye West, Both]
We striving home (What?)
I ride on chrome
Listen, homeboy, move on
That's your best bet, why's that, Cons'?
(Now see 'Quence, come on)

[Verse 3: Consequence]
I been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And trying to help his Momma with the fact that her child's gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got afoul on what could've gone wrong
Now they asking Cons, "How long has this gone on?"
And maybe all this money might have gone to my head
'Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds
So I had gone to the dread, but he had gone up to bed
And when I came the next morning, he was gone with my bread
And with that being said, I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But looking back now, I should've gone to the crib
And rented Gone With the Wind, 'cause I'da gone in by ten
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for twenty years, doing time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, 'cause I'm gone

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Make some noise for Consequence, y'all
It's G.O.O.D. Music, baby
Out on these shores
2006, Don't Quit Your Day Job
I'ma get a string somethin' for a minute
Make some noise for the strings right now
They've been playing so beautifully, don't you agree?
Don't you agree? The wire strings, that is
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh, on, uh-uh-uh, on
Uh-uh, on, uh-uh-uh

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
I'm, uh, ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye, step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the 1-9-9-9
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me, "Benz or Rover?"
Man, if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old?
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play your role
Dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later, the manager count the churro
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirro'
How we out in Europe, spending Euros
They say you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MCs
Sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You will sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on, I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorties at the door 'cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
Told 'em, "Sorry, Mr. West is gone"

[Refrain: Whatnauts & Kanye West]
Little girl (A-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Please stop your crying

[Interlude: Kanye West]
That is why A-Trak is a five-time world champion DJ
'Cause he can fix any fuck-up, and, uh

[Chorus: Kanye West & Whatnauts]
(I'll be late for that) I'll be late for that, I'll wait for that
Had a taste for that, I'm messin' up too, but, uh
(I'll be late for that) 'Cause I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right
(I'll be late for that) I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
(I'll be late for that) So I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right

[Refrain: Whatnauts & Kanye West]
Little girl (A-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Please stop your crying
'Cause I'll be late for that

Yeah, I hear the alarm, yeah, I hear you, Mom
Yeah, yeah, I don't wan' be broke when I'm thirty-one
They say the best classes go to the fastest, sorry, Mr. West
There's no good classes, and that's what yo' ass get
Not even electives? Not even prerequisites?
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?
Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin'
With all the rest of the motherfuckers underachievin'
Man, this is an insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can make it to this slow, this is the intro
Then I said somethin', but I fucked it up real slow
Will I make it to a big loans to a Benz?
Like old folks pissin', I guess it all depends, oh, oh

[Refrain: Whatnauts & Kanye West]
Little girl (A-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Please stop your crying
'Cause I'll be late for that

[Chorus: Kanye West & Whatnauts]
(I'll be late for that) I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I was made for that, I keep on fuckin' it up
(I'll be late for that) 'Cause I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right
(I'll be late for that) Yeah, I'll be late for that, I was made for that
I can't wait for that, yeah
(I'll be late for that) So I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right

[Refrain: Whatnauts & Kanye West]
Little girl (A-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Please stop your crying
'Cause I'll be late for that

[Interlude: Kanye West]
See, what– you have to let this track
You have to let the CD play, it's the bonus track
Just let the CD play, let it play like a couple of extra few seconds
And you'll hear, um

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You know when you be late, you miss all the lights
That's right (That's right), that's right (That's right)
Uh, and when you get back, she gon' start up a fight
That night (That night), that night
Baby, it's too late for that, lately I've been takin it slow
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes, the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional
Like them Eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike?
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian-like?
Man, I'll be on time with that
I ain't thought of no rhymes that could rhyme with that
Man, I'll be there in five minutes, five hours later?
"I'll be there in five minutes," go 'head, ride with it
I'm so live with it, look how I did it
Been bullshittin' but I'm tellin' ya, I did it
I know it's late and I took all year but
You can stop complainin' 'cause I'm finally here, yeah, uh

[Outro: Whatnauts & Kanye West]
'Cause I'll be late for that
Uh, I'm so bad, but I'm so glad
I'll be late for that
I'm so bad, I'm so bad, but I'm so glad
I'll be late for that (This is the part I take off)
I'm so bad, I'm so bad, but I'm so glad
I'll be late for that (Hello, can I get some Autotune?)
I'm so bad, I'm so bad, but I'm so
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha

[Intro: Kanye West]
We at war
We at war with terrorism, racism
But most of all, we at war with ourselves
Now let me hear you say

[Chorus: Kanye West & The Arc Choir]
(Jesus walk)
God show me the way
Because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walk with me)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
Where restless (Niggas) might snatch your necklace
And next these (Niggas) might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these (Niggas) who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor, the view alone will leave you breathless *gasps*
Try to catch it, *gasps* it's kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives, yeah, now check the method
They askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
Sayin', "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast"
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My mama used to say, "Only Jesus can save us"
Well, mama, I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move, I hope

[Chorus: Kanye West & The Arc Choir]
(Jesus walk)
God show me the way
Because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walk with me)
Pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus walk)
And I don't think there's nothin' I could do now
To right my wrongs
(Jesus walk with me)
I wanna talk to God
But I'm afraid 'cause we ain't spoke in so long
(Jesus walk)
God show me the way
The Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walk with me)
The only thing that I pray
Is that my feet don't fail me now
(Break me down, break me down
Break me down, break me down
Break me down, break me down)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
To the hustlers, killers
Murderers, drug dealers, even the strippers
(Jesus walks for them)
To the victims of welfare, feel we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah
(Jesus walks for them)
Now, hear he, hear he, want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
We're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models: we rap, we don't think
I ain't here to argue about His facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's how I need Jesus
So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this
They said you could rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played?
Well, if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
I hope it take away from my sins
Bring the day that I dream about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out

[Chorus: Kanye West & The Arc Choir]
(Jesus walk)
God show me the way
The Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walk with me)
The only thing that I pray
Is that my feet don't fail me now

[Intro]
No, no
No, no, no, no
No, no
No, no, no, no
No, no
No, no, no, no
No, no
No, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Life's crazy
My parents worried 'bout me
'Cause I didn't talk to nobody, just made beats
And now I get paid by the syllable
Gotta thank 'em though, I know it can be difficult
As I tip-toe in and out of zip codes
All on a mission of love, that's what I live for
I got big dreams, ma, I got big goals
You see my old ones now because I lived those
You got to admit, ma
I told you I was gonna get into Duke and I did, ma
I told you I would get signed and I did, ma
Look at this, ma, look at this, ma

[Interlude]
No, no
No, no, no, no
No, no
No, no, no, no

[Verse 2]
All my friends feel trapped and afraid
I close my eyes and try to imagine a way
To wash all my old patterns away
I had to stop smokin' 'cause it scattered my brain
"Fuck bitches" is what my favorite rappers would say
I say there is something beautiful after the pain
After the pain, this can't be real
Turns out the ladder to fame is a hamster wheel
When we played the Palace, my parents were first row
That's a feeling that I don't even have words for
I did my song, went backstage, and drank a Henny bottle
Picked up my phone and then I started texting any model
I used to put a target on every cute face
And keep Plan B pills in my suitcase
"That's gross, time to grow," that's what Ronny said
Man, Willie just called, "Dawg, Ronny's dead"
I'm tryna stumble to a truer view
I'm noticing the sky is a bluer hue
It's time to get to work, that's what doers do
I'm looking in the mirror like, "Who are you?"
Hey Mike, this is your boy Diddy here.
I know you're about to go on this journey.
I want you to remember
One foot in front of the other, step by step.
God is with you. He told me.
You're inspiring the world, you're doing something
That's gonna make a difference.
But you know what you really doing?
You're putting your heart on the line, boy
For something you believe in.
So don't stop, never stop, never quit.
You can do it, you doin' it, look at you, kid.
You're walking across America.
Damn, you a bad motherfucker.
Never stop, keep going.
Never stop, keep doing.
Never stop, keep going.
See you at the finish line, kid.

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
I won God's lottery
And dad's still watchin' me
That's camaraderie, woah, woah, woah
The game ain't new to me
Ain't nothin' they could do to me
I ain't gotta wear jewelry
I still shine, I still shine on 'em, woo
Hair curly, I look like Zeus
I'm Omar Epps, I got the juice
I feel like the boss, go tell Bruce
I'm gettin' close to the truth

[Chorus: Elohim]
I think I got angels watching
My life just keeps on unlocking, oh
I'm gonna make it to the other side
I think I got angels watching

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
Ladies and gentlemen, Pos' back with the real
Second meditation, tryna catch me a feel
A little bit of presence is all it took
Beard longer than a David Foster Wallace book
Nothing trumps time ever
Most underrated, Kawhi Leonard
Gheorghe Mureșan, I'm centered
Welcome to the world, fourth trimester
Tom Hanks said I'm dope
Don't know where I am, but I'm headed home
I might pop up in your city, dawg, you never know
And don't forget change is like a metronome
And the beard is like war paint
Duke game is my only court date
Outside all year, walkin' towards fate
My North Face isn't ornate
They shoulda never let me read Borges
The breakup hit me in a sore place
This is now a one-horse race
Everybody love me like my name is King George Strait, woo

[Chorus: Elohim]
I think I got angels watching
My life just keeps on unlocking, oh
I'm gonna make it to the other side
I think I got angels watching, woah

[Outro: Elohim]
Bada-bada-ba-ba-ba-ba-da
Bada-bada-ba-ba-bada-ba-ba
Rensop Ekim, that's Michael Posner backwards.
I just, I’m one of those guys.
Mine is Nevets Ocirallat.
Fathom that one.
Anyway, Michael
I just read your fucking list of who can run with you
And what they should think about and you're brilliant.
Will you be my guru when you get back?
I will rub your feet with oil.
I will anoint your feet after, hahaha, with all the blisters you're gonna have.
I love you, bro. Um, I love you so much.
I’m gonna be following your ass and you'll be halfway across America.
And, uh, I'll be following you, man. I'll follow you, and...
I love you so much, bye bye.

[Intro]
Good job, 1st

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
I fell in love with a sunset
I fell in love with a cloud
I don't remember how I got here
I just know I’m lookin' down
It's fun up here, feelin’ real good
Man, it's fun up here, I'm feelin' real good
I fell in love with my damn self
My freckles and my back (My freckles and my back)
I fell in love with the whole world
I know it loves me back
That's why it put me high
It's fun up here, feelin' real good
It's fun up here, I’m feelin’ real good
I'm just slidin’ down a rainbow, got a lotta leg room
I'm lookin' for my pot of gold (I'm lookin’ for my pot of gold)
I know I'll get it soon
Uh, I got lovin' in my blood, man, I'm feelin' real yummy
John Hamilton and Attaman, I'm keepin' good company
How come a pair of eyes is pretty and a rainy day is ugly?
Man, I ain't got nothin', so you can't take nothin' from me
'Cause it's fun up here, and I'm real good
You know it's fun up here, I'm feelin' real good

[Verse 2: Logic]
Yeah, uh
I woke up today in a mansion
I'm seven out of ten handsome
But my talent make me a tenant, so
Kick you to the curb, Ted Danson
Chillin' in a droptop, pedal to the high top
My studio is a hotbox
No baby, don't stop, no baby, don't drop
Can't see these haters like a Bird Box
Livin' on food stamps, dyin' on welfare
Dyin' and I had no healthcare
Wake up blessed everyday, life's slippin' away
And I'm actin' like I don't care
I got a job, I got a bed, I got a beautiful home, I ain't dead
I got a mind of my own, I'm richer than money
Oh yeah, boy, you heard what I said
Money can't fill your heart (No)
Money can't fill your heart (No, no, no, no)
Money can't fill your heart
Money can't fill your heart (No, no, no, no)
Money can't fill your heart
Money can't fill your heart (No, no, no, no)
Money can't fill your heart
Only love can fill your heart, only fill your heart

[Outro: Mike Posner]
It's fun up here, feelin' real good
It's fun up here, feelin' real good
What up, doe?

You are about to listen to the mixtape Keep Going.
The mixtape is 52 minutes long and is best listened to front to back with no interruptions.
That means no e-mail, no texts, no phone, etc.
If you do not have 52 minutes of undivided attention to devote
I politely and humbly ask you turn this off and come back at a later time.

By the time you hear this, I will be in the middle of the hardest journey of my life.
That is, I will be walking, yeah, walking, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean.
I will not fail.

I created this project, these songs, and these affirmations
To remind myself who I am when things get hard.
I hope they can provide you the same strength.

Love

[Intro: Kanye West & Bon Iver]
For the lot in the silver
The universe align
I don't wanna look into the past
I know

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Wanna speed in being, we don't need the time
We don't need to fight, we ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie, I could feel your light
I could take and lie, I am taking signs
Take it for the might, take it for the might
All up in a mine, all up in a line
Oh no, it's in the sky, waitin' for the fright
I got more than I wanna want the time

[Chorus: Kanye West & Bon Iver]
You still take me to the light every time (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
You take me to the light every time
And the stars will align every time
You ain't lyin' (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
You ain't lyin', you ain't lyin'
You take me to the light every time (Oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You know, scenic burst, I know what running for your mind
You ain't sayin' 'fore you die, you all crazy, you was mine
You could summon in my vine, I was fun in your prime
I need sun all with my vine, I got motherfuckin' mind
Keep it classy though
Keep 'em gassin' on 'em
There's a fine line
There's a fine line, baby

[Chorus: Kanye West & Bon Iver]
And you still take me to the light every time (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
You still take me to the light every time (Oh, oh, oh)
It seem like our stars align every time
You ain't lyin' (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
You ain't lyin', you ain't lyin'
You gon' take me to the light every time (Oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Ayy, don't stop, wanna see, okay, uh
Nigga, I was, I was born, nigga, DOA, uh
Niggas treatin' lot of shit but I don't see your face, uh
Take a step on the throne, we gon' beat the base, uh
Take a stage, take the throne, we can take the stage, uh
Make a stage, make 'em lay, make it on the stage, uh
Play for maze on the day for a paper chase, uh
Take the stage, make it pay, make it face for face

[Verse 1]
Delete your pictures from the internet
Try hard to pretend it's cool
Summer in August with our favourite friends
Now they're reminding me of you

[Chorus]
I think about you
Do you think about me?
'Cause I think about you
All of the time
I think about you
Do you think about me?
'Cause I think about you
All of the time
All of the time

[Post-Chorus]
All of the, all of the, all of the
All of the time, you
All of the, all of the, all of the
All of the time, all of the time
All of the, all of the, all of the
All of the time, you
All of the, all of the, all of the
All of the time

[Verse 2]
I knew the second that I walked away
Things would never be the same, no no
Threw out our memories, forgot your name
But I could not forget your face

[Chorus]
I think about you
Do you think about me?
'Cause I think about you
All of the time
I think about you
Do you think about me?
'Cause I think about you
All of the time
All of the time

[Post-Chorus]
All of the, all of the, all of the
All of the time, you
All of the, all of the, all of the
All of the time, all of the time
All of the, all of the, all of the
All of the time, you
All of the, all of the, all of the
All of the time

[Verse 1]
I heard bad boys give a good time
Oh, yeah-yeah, yeah, mmm
I heard bad boys put it on the ice
Oh, yeah-yeah, yeah, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Pop a thousand pills and come on meet me in the bathroom
Danger zone at 4am, I like it when you come through
Hundred miles an hour, Kawasaki, zoom-a-zoom zoom
Baby, you're my type, you know I like it

[Chorus]
You know my type be the bad ones, woo-hoo
Oh, yeah-yeah
You know my type be the bad ones, woo-hoo, mhh
Trick me once before, you trick me, do it o-o-ooh
Leave ya mark just like a hickey, do it, ooh
I said my type be the bad ones, wo-o-o-ooh

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm a NASCAR down for that ride
Oh, yeah-yeah, yeah, mmm
And I'ma stay this way until I die
Oh, yeah-yeah, yeah, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Pop a thousand pills and come on meet me in the bathroom
Danger zone at 4 AM, I like it when you come through
Hundred miles an hour, Kawasaki, zoom-a-zoom zoom
Baby, you're my type, you know I like it

[Chorus]
You know my type be the bad ones, woo-hoo
Oh, yeah-yeah
You know my type be the bad ones, woo-hoo, mhh
Trick me once before, you trick me, do it o-o-ooh
Leave ya mark just like a hickey, do it, ooh
I said my type be the bad ones, wo-o-o-ooh

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I get jealous, sometimes I get reckless
Sometimes I get bitter, fuck up, make it better
Maybe you heard stories, maybe they're all true
And if we make it farther, I'll show it all to you

[Pre-Chorus]
When I feel alone, I feel ashamed
I wanna know if you would stay with me
When I lose control, I go insane
And I know you can get like that, too
Would you still love me? I would still love you

[Chorus]
Would you?
Would you love me if I lost my cool?
In the deep, or the dark days too
Would you still love me? I would still love you
Would you?
Would you love me in my worn out shoes?
If you knew, it could all fall through
Would you still love me? I would still love you
Would you?

[Post-Chorus]
Even if you were broke and you couldn't pay rent and you're feeling depressed
Wouldn't love you less, I'd still love you
Even if you were living on nothing but hope from the heart in your chest
I will still be there
(Would you?)

[Verse 2]
I'm nervous, you see behind the curtain
Crash your car on purpose, just to push you further
Maybe you heard stories, and now you know they're true
But there's another side to me, I'll show it all to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I lose control, I go insane
And I know you can get like that, too
Would you still love me? I would still love you

[Chorus]
Would you?
Would you love me if I lost my cool?
In the deep, or the dark days too
Would you still love me? I would still love you
Would you?
Would you love me in my worn out shoes?
If you knew, it could all fall through
Would you still love me? I would still love you
Would you?

[Post-Chorus]
Even if you were broke and you couldn't pay rent and you're feeling depressed
Wouldn't love you less, I'd still love you
Even if you were living on nothing but hope from the heart in your chest
I will still be there
(Would you?)

[Bridge]
Would you?
Would you?
If you found someone shiny and brand new
Would you still love me? I would still love you

[Chorus]
Would you?
Would you love me if I lost my cool?
In the deep, or the dark days too
Would you still love me? I would still love you
Would you?
Would you love me in my worn out shoes?
If you knew, it could all fall through
Would you still love me? I would still love you
Would you?

[Outro]
Would you?
Would you still love me? I would still love you
Would you?
Would you?
Would you still love me? I would still love you
Would you?

[Intro: Jhené Aiko]
What's up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love
I wish you could see
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love

[Verse 2: Drake]
Shoulda spent more nights
Coulda changed your life
We woulda been alright
All these shoulda, coulda, wouldas
In her ear one time
Prolly wastin' my time
'Cause she heard it all
'Cause she heard it all
Girl, I coulda changed your life
But you heard it all
Well I'ma say it anyway
Shawty, I'm from the city
Where we were never taught to love
You ain't gotta be in love to fuck
Girl, I'm just tryna say
I'm from the city, oh
Where the money makes a difference
But it never made us different, oh

[Intro: Rihanna]
One spliff a day keep my mind right
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One-one spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil-evil away

[Chorus: Rihanna]
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away

[Verse: Rihanna]
I blow tree everyday in my house, in my car, I love to blaze
Got the best smoke on the west coast, in LA (that's right)
Smoking bomb-bomb going dum-dum
Screaming one love got my L up, bout to roll a blunt
Take a puff-puff of the diesel
Hit the plug up till I run us a kilo
I'm laid back in a Maybach blowing zeroes
Up to the ozone gripping my solo I'm so gone so long

[Rihanna]
I might just bring a gram to the Grammy's
I might cop it straight off the boat in Miami
If you ain't puttin' my nigga then we ain't passin'
Light up my troubles then watch them turn into ashes

One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One-one spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil-evil away

[Chorus: Rihanna]
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away

You know I smoke so I can blow the pain away
And as you know
One spliff a day keep my mind right

[Verse: Rihanna]
Wake up in the morning then I pray to Jah
Please give me mercy fi the ganja
Know they gotta' smell this dime bag on this dimepiece
I might catch a charge if the copper search me
Not one, not two, not three, not four
Who the fuck these narcos at my door
They want war, they want war
I make green my decor
Imma let these motherfuckers know who da boss

[Rihanna]
I might just bring a gram to the Grammy's
I might cop it straight off the boat in Miami
If you ain't puttin' my nigga then we ain't passin'
Light up my troubles then watch them turn into ashes

One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One-one spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil-evil away

[Chorus: Rihanna]
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away

[Outro: Rihanna]
You know I smoke so I can blow the pain away
And as you know
One spliff a day keep my mind right
Circling Tokyo
Waiting to land
Holding pattern thirty stories high

Don't wanna stay here
But I'll crash anyway
Never learned how to come down without burning up on the runway

Don't look
God, it's a mess
A seven-car pileup of every disastrous thing that I've been
Crane your neck
The aftermath
The imprint of my body left

Like a hotel patron in your bed
A postcard, no return address
It's nothing like you said you wanted
Nothing like you'll get and

You want love
This is as close as you're gonna get
Not enough
Just as much as you think you can live with
Until it's all gone, baby
It's all gone, baby
Going off the rails
Got enough gas and time to waste
Feel you in the highway braille
Steering with my eyes shut, half-awake
No one has to know
Maybe if you turned the car around
Just try to get home

Coming down the exits to your house
Sleeping in my clothes
Waking from a nightmare on your couch
Thought I couldn't get much lower
Nowhere else to go when you come down

Too tired to fight anymore
Started giving in, I throw a match
Cleanup like an oil spill
I'm down at the gas station all night
Trying to wash it off

Bathin' in the pale blue neon light
Handed you a knife with the handle out
I could see you throw a sucker punch
A broken floating rib
Permanent scar
A temporary fix
Say it's fine
I'm not convinced
Tossing a cord and I'm
Holding my breath
Nobody's faultless
It's anybody's guess
Bury me face-down
So I can keep climbing in
Help me to get out
So that I can crawl back to it
OK Take One

It's been so long since we had someone to look up to
But that's just not the case anymore
Just look up in the sky and say what the fuck though
And you'll see your hero
Bust right through that door

That's how you know Trover
Save the Universe
Don't play any other game
The other games will break your PS4

That's how you know Trover
Save the Universe
You can play it on your TV or in VR if you just want some more

It's funny as shit
Just play this game
You might see a dick
Just play this game
Reverse psychology I don't give a shit
If you just play this game
Obviously we want you to play Trover
Save the Universe
I'm not even getting paid and I'm T-Pain
I just want to say how much I love this game

And I feel like Trover Save the Universe

You'd be insane in the brain if you don't want to help us make more games like this thang

[Intro]
Oh my God, Ronny!

[Chorus: 6ix9ine & Kanye West]
Can't wait to see your new body
And you're actin' like you don't know nobody
No body count on your new body
(On your new body, old dick don't count)
Can't wait to see your new body
I'll be the first one to hit your new body, woah
(On your new body, old dick don't count)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
On that new body, old dick don't count
One new titty, those tits don't bounce
Want, gonna do six, no bounce
Gotta run it up before the sun on our account
Fuck on the thot, we ain't runnin' without the stacks
Your friends need an ass so we checkin' my account
One false account, I gotta check it for the stacks

[Incoherent mumbling]
Uh, uh, face down
Funny how the problems is the situation
You and her are somethin', now on vacation
And never gonna settle for this vacation
Going for the son, like the vacation
Two weeks here is like a stay-cation
Take facetime, wanna stay patient
What they gonna do, huh, stay ace huh?

[Chorus: 6ix9ine with Kanye West]
Can't wait to see your new body (Huh, you just got you, huh)
And you're actin' like you don't know nobody (Know nobody)
You said that no body count on this new body
(Old dick don't count, these titties don't bounce)
Can't wait to see your new body
I'll be the first one to hit your new body, woah
(Old dick don't count, these titties don't bounce)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Bounce, hold it, where we signin' for amount?
Bounce, make me want to look at your account
Friend need an ass, let me look at my account
Let me see you, uh, let me see that boy bounce
Bounce, situation, fuck with something on every situation
Prayin' like the sun, you want to stay patient
But you got new body and you got it, one of one

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Can't wait to see your new body
Now you're actin' like you don't know nobody
You said that no body count on this new body
(Old dick don't count, these titties don't bounce)

[Refrain: Kanye West]
Ooh, will you come through shortie?
Ooh, will you come through shortie?
Ooh, will you come through shortie?
Ooh, will you come through shortie?
Gotta come through for me
Ooh, will you come through shortie?
Gotta come through for me
Ooh, will you come through shortie?
Gotta come through for me

[Outro: Kanye West]
Ooh Mike Dean, we got Mike Dean in the building
Before you ask for everything
Can I tell you where I've been?
Can I talk to you about my life and the saddest things
I've seen?

You see now I'm stood above this stage
Singing for you all,
You seem to think you've worked me out,
You're such a know-it-all

I'm not a poet,
I'm not a Linguist,
So the rhyme in this is simple,
But the voice you hear is the kid in me,
Who stills gets growing pains and pimples

Yesterday I walked off stage,
I found it hard to breathe.
I cancelled all my commitments,
And flew home over the seas.
See lately I've been feeling low,
A darkness keeps me blue -
I've always felt it deep inside,
Successfully kept it all from you.

But now I'm bursting at the seams,
My chest is getting tight.
I think there is something wrong with me:
My days now feel like night.

It's made my questionably regrettably
How much I want to live
I'm embarrassed, ashamed, and petrified
I have so much more to give

So I'll stop the show
Put down the drink
Throw poison down the sink
I'll turn away from what I love
I'll pray, I'll cry, I'll think

My mum will whisper 'you're okay'
My dad will kiss my head
My sister keep my laughing,
Till I'm safe and warm in bed
My friends will try to empathize
Their efforts fill me up
With joy and pain and gratitude
I'll slowly feel enough

I look around and realize
So many feel like me
So many people get this low
And feel anxiety

The only thing that helps me is the ability to talk
To write my problems down like this
On blackboards drowned in chalk

I wonder If I didn't have the outlet that I do
What do you think would be of me
Would I be here now with you

These questions go unanswered
This life is so insane
I guess I have to live with all this self-inflicated pain

So goodbye for now
I'm sorry if this poem was too sad
Before you ask me everything
Remember
Like You
I'm fucking mad

[Chorus]
Open your eyes
And make room for a little sweet love
The Lord is all around you, child
And that's what you're made of
Remember, there is a light
And it shines bright just for you
And you can't cut yourself off from it
No matter what you do

[Verse]
I had a 3.5 at Duke and I was blowin' up
Three albums, I got a row of ducks
When my dad was 22, dawg, he drove a truck
January in Detroit is cold as fuck
You know it's tough, but I came this far, I ain't slowin up
Livin' life with the LeBron James shoulder-shrug
One thing you'll never hear me say is "Close enough"
I'm dope as fuck
I lost 2018 to a broken heart
I wrote this whole thing, I know my part
I made a wild fire from a glowing spark
I press go in March, I gotta go and march
All previous conceptions are blown apart
Not everyone can come with me, it's Noah's Ark
I ain't Gregg Popovich, I have no remark
These are the type of riches one can only hold in heart (Woo)
And anyone that's gone over my history
Knows I ain't stuck in the mold of the industry
I am walking down a road of epiphanies
Three words: growth over consistency
Woo, back again, they've been tapping out, McGregor
I've been tapping in
Livin' out the dreams I was once just imaginin', it's happenin'
I get so much work done nowadays, it's almost like I have a twin
I can't just sit on the couch shoveling shit in my mouth
I don't know how I'ma walk across this country
But I know I'm a figure it out
And who knows what I'm gon' do when it's done
Hopefully, I touch a life; you could be one
I'm not walking to show people who l am
I'm walking to find out who I'll become
And people ain't stupid, they know what's real
Sometime to get to Heaven, we gotta go through hell
And I'm rollin' deep, no Adele
You could ask World Wide Wes, dawg, he knows me well
My life's like an instruction manual
How to not be borin' (Not be borin')
It's my spirit, my smile
That have got me soarin' (Got me soarin')
It broke my heart to tell the band
We will not be tourin' (Not be tourin')
But I just gotta do this (I gotta do it)
I can't stop explorin' (No no)
I was a short lil' Jewish kid, I ain't speak much
My whole life now is somethin' that I've dreamed up
With no handout, I look at my heroes and that's what I am now
Yoga class headband now
People say I'm off-brand, how?
I am the brand
Therefore, anything I do is on-brand now
I'm on-brand now
People got attached to a version of me
And it hurts when they see a person who's free
But I'm so grateful for all of these lessons
Twice as much money, half the possessions
No drugs, now the vision's clear
People mad 'cause the old me isn't here
All my gold jewelry just disappeared
That's the universe tellin' me to start switchin' gears
Deeper the human, the deeper the songs
Look at my life, the dream isn't gone
I saw all of this two years ago
It's almost like it was me reading my poem
People copy, but they copy wrong
Puttin' out a bunch of sloppy songs
If I die in the Rockies, don't
Forget to bury me with the Petoskey stone
And opportunities keep on poppin' up
Killer concepts come to me in shavasana
This is just a intro, another vibe
The rest comes when I make it to the other side

[Chorus]
Open your eyes
Make room for a little sweet love
The Lord is all around you, child
And that's what you're made of
Remember, there is a light
And it shines bright just for you
You can't cut yourself off from it
No matter what you do, no

[Outro]
Open your eyes

Do you know who you are?

Then ju… okay, I got it
Then just drop down and get your eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion

Say she from the hood, but she live inside in the valley, now
Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali, mmm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a don’t-a don't exist
Girl, I know you want this
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar (Uh)
A.K.A. Benz is to me just a car (Uh)
That mean your friends-es need be up to par

[Verse 1]
Isn't it strange that you used to know me?
All the highs and lows and in-betweens
And now you see me and just say, "Hey"
Isn't it weird that you've seen me naked?
We had conversations 'bout forever
Now it's 'bout the weather, okay

[Pre-Chorus]
And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers

[Chorus]
Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been
Ain't it funny?
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk
Small talk
Now there's nothing left but small talk
Small talk (Baby)
Now there's nothing left but small talk

[Verse 2]
Isn't it wild that I know your weakness?
And everybody at the party thinks
That you're the best since sliced bread
And isn't it awkward I got a new somebody?
And honestly it'll probably be a while before we can just be friends

[Pre-Chorus]
I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers
(Now there's nothing left)

Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin

Small talk
Now there's nothing left but small talk
Small talk (Baby)
Now there's nothing left but small talk

And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers (Oh, no)

[Chorus]
Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
We were, we were lovers
Now there's nothing left
Now there's nothing left

[Verse]
Took out the lambo
Man, this thing got handles
One hand on the booty, this a damn scandal
Ready for it like you panhandle
Pants saggin', I'm a damn vandal
Like Van Damme do it
Took a couple years off, shed a couple tears, dog, messed up here and there
No fear here, dog, got a wife, living life, living right, yeah, it's tight
Gluten free, look at me, would'a thought I'd be nice
When I rap, I will slap on the beat
I attack with the heat, no strap
I defeat, no cap
Yeah, my style is impeccable, my wife, yeah, I put her on a pedestal
Yeah, my life is like the movie The Incredibles
They put me on some medicine
Never thought that my depression would depend on it, I've been sending it
Going hard running on adrenaline
Been a victim of the system, I'm a Christian with a vision, I'm a gentleman

[Chorus]
Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eyes dog and I can see
I'm tryna be what I'm destined to be and people try to take my life away
I don't hold grudges cause I ain't no sucker
Why let it get to me when we don't even know each other, go ahead and talk what you want about me and I'm gonna go and turn the other way
Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eyes dog and I can see
I'm tryna be what I'm destined to be and people try to take my life away
I don't hold grudges cause I ain't no sucker
I don't even let it get to me, go ahead and talk what you want about me and I'm gonna go and turn the other way

[Bridge?]
And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers strangers to lovers
To lovers
And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers strangers to lovers
To lovers

[Chorus]
Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been
Ain't it funny?
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk

[Post-Chorus]
And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers

[Chorus]
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk
Small talk
Small talk
Small talk
Now there's nothing left

[Post-Chorus]
And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers strangers to lovers
To lovers
And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers strangers to lovers
To lovers

[Breakdown?]
Nothing left, nothing left, baby
Oh no
No
Now there's nothing left
Nothing left, nothing left, baby
Oh no
No
Now there's nothing left
Now there's nothing left, nothing left, nothing left
Nothing left, nothing left, oh
Now there's nothing, now there's nothing, now there's nothing
Now there's nothing left, nothing left, nothing left
Now there's nothing left but small talk
Small talk
Small talk
Small talk
Now there's nothing left

[Bridge]
And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers strangers to lovers
To lovers
And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers strangers to lovers
To lovers
Now there's nothing left
Now there's nothing left, nothing left, nothing left
Nothing left, nothing left, oh
Now there's nothing, now there's nothing, now there's nothing
Now there's nothing left, nothing left, nothing left
Nothing left, now there's nothing left
Now there's, now there's nothing left
Now there's, now there's nothing left

[Verse]
Ah, voices gold, my damn teeth turned gold too (Gold too)
Malone is on some other shit but player, that's some old news (That's some old news)
Roll through and told you that I just bought some dope shoes (Motherfucker)
My shit screw, my bitch new, haters standing like statues (Statues)
Bitch, I'm tryna get that 2Pac money
You can't count it 'cause it's too high money
You fuckers repping and I'm laughing 'cause it's too damn funny (Ha)
Got a playboy bunny and she tryna take these boxers from me
A Cuban and some Sean Don (Some Sean Don)
Can't afford the shit that I'm on (Motherfucker)
A motherfucking rap phenomenon (Rap phenomenon)
All my checks, don't forget to add the motherfucking commas on
Expensive vices, payin' too much for liquor (Liquor)
You'd have to put 'em down if my raps were any sicker (Sicker)
You'd have to put me down if my swag was any slicker (Slicker)
Park my shit on top of your shit, check the bumper sticker

[Outro]
I need a dime, a drink and, a couple dime bitches
A dime, a drink and, a couple dime bitches
A dime, a drink and—

[Verse 1]
To begin to be in the position we in
My bitch say I'm shallow, I dove off the deep end
I grew up wit' hooligans, outlaws, and heathens
Everyone lookin' for somethin' to believe in
I'm facing my fear while shakin' my demons
The scales of a Libra are always uneven 'cause this is embarrassin', from season to season
From “fight for my people” to fightin' and beefin'
The pressure, the pressure
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus
Like Kodak said, “You ain't believe in no Jesus”
From gamblin' and traps slangin' elbows of reefer to doin' that rappin' shit, releasin' that classic shit
Ain't no competition, they get no attention
Can't nobody come and do it more efficient
So official
Leakin' in the trauma center
That and actin' like a ho'll get you, man

[Hook]
I don't give a damn what nobody got to say about me
And I don' did that
Listen, to respect somethin' I ain't finna play 'bout it
So, ya try me, and it's “anybody get it”
Seem' like everybody wanna catch a body just to hit the studio and rap about it
Got a future, they gon' wanna sabotage it
Go to prison, bet ya they gon' laugh about it (yeah)
Don't give a damn what nobody got to say about me
And I don' did that
Listen, to respect somethin' I ain't finna play 'bout it
So, ya try me, and it's “anybody get it”
Seem' like everybody wanna catch a body just to hit the studio and rap about it
Got a future, they gon' wanna sabotage it
Go to prison, bet ya they gon' laugh about it (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
No competition, guess everyone winnin'
On IG, all I see is people pretendin'
Cloud chasin', fakin', and dyin' to fit in
Everyone say social media did it, but people been fake long as people been livin'
So, look at they actions, forget they intentions
Ok, kids in the audience, listen
Never trust in nobody, not more than yo vision
Now yo energy thrown, you divert from yo mission
All 'cause of some comments and someone's opinion, goddamn
Look, you'll never be great
You expect everybody to see what you sayin'
Develop a plan, research the people who did it before you
Be willin' to stand up for dreams and believe make it happen like only you can, man

[Hook]
I don't give a damn what nobody got to say about me
And I don' did that
Listen, to respect somethin' I ain't finna play 'bout it
So, ya try me, and it's “anybody get it”
Seem' like everybody wanna catch a body just to hit the studio and rap about it
Got a future, they gon' wanna sabotage it
Go to prison, bet ya they gon' laugh about it (yeah)
I don't give a damn what nobody got to say about me
And I don' did that
Listen, to respect somethin' I ain't finna play 'bout it
So, ya try me, and it's “anybody get it”
Seem' like everybody wanna catch a body just to hit the studio and rap about it
Got a future, they gon' wanna sabotage it
Go to prison, bet ya they gon' laugh about it (Yeah)

[Verse]
The choice was mine, and mine completely
I could have any prize that I desired
I could burn with the splendor of the brightest fire
Or else, or else I could choose time
Remember I was very young then
And a year was forever and a day
So what use could fifty, sixty, seventy be?
I saw the lights, and I was on my way
And how I lived, how they shone
But how soon the lights were gone

[Chorus]
Anything you wear
We don't even care
If you come to represent the dog, then you say “Yeah” (Yeah)
All you need is your dog collar (With diamonds on it, baby)
Anything you wear
We don't even care
If you come to represent the dog, then you say “Yeah” (Yeah)
All you need is your dog collar! (With diamonds on it, baby)
It's not a problem that I can't fix
‘Cause I can do it in the mix
It's not a problem that I can't fix
‘Cause I can do it in the mix

[Verse 1]
So Mystical, Magical
It's not a lamp, it's a collar
And it's guaranteed to get you dollars
Make 'em wanna holla in this hole like an impala
It's Snoop Dogg and you know I'm top dolla
Groovin', and movin', provin' once again
Coming on through, ‘cause yes I gots to win
I can't lose, I bruise and cruise
Keep it all in the ooze
And leave 'em all confused
They losers like that

[Verse 2: Bad Azz]
Life is hard as a brick or turn
Through the stress, and the struggle
But you gotta be strong
Have muscle, hustle, hard as you can, I am
‘Cause I be damned if I'm broke, starving, living outta can
Man I live my life like Puff-a-little
Get right through
My mind focused on my money
So my shit's tight
Best believe that's right
And if I'm wrong, then the beach that I'm from ain't row
But it's strong, and you can see
Even if you ain't starin'
You weak, you can't rap, there ain't no comparin' (Hahaha)
East Side's Greatest outlaws
No flaws, no slips, pump your breaks, hit the disc
Get the chips, yeah
The new hundred look funny
But this paper ain't no dope
It'll still get you smoked
It's the dope
That a make a nigga weak and fall asleep
And can't cope with life on the streets

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
And that's for real
So bow down to the bow-wow cause he coming back with a new style
And it'll make you holla
The top dollar
And all you need is your dog collar

[Chorus]
Anything you wear
We don't even care
If you come to represent the dog, then you say “Yeah” (Yeah)
All you need is your dog collar (With diamonds on it, baby)
Anything you wear
We don't even care
If you come to represent the dog, then you say Yeah (Yeah)
All you need is your dog collar (With diamonds on it, baby)

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
Now, I see what you see
But you probably don't believe
What I believe, you got a trick up your sleeve
Ain't too much, just too hot to rush
Sit back, relax, and let me go ahead and buzz it up
I’mma get into it, Cuz you know I can
And I’mma hit with you the hellified masterplan
Intelligence, elegance
And what you wear is irrelevant
So please, don't feel hesistant
‘Cause you know the dogg collar is a precedent, in his resident
And the message is
No money, drink, no weed, all you need
Is this prestige, collar
That'll make ya grandma wanna holla
Diamonds in the bank, like an impala
And I wouldn't trade mine for a million dollars

[Chorus]
Anything you wear
We don't even care
If you come to represent the dog, then you say “Yeah” (Yeah)
All you need is your dog collar (With diamonds on it, baby)
Anything you wear
We don't even care
If you come to represent the dog, then you say “Yeah” (Yeah)
All you need is your dog collar (With diamonds on it, baby)
It's not a problem that I can't fix
‘Cause I can do in the mix
It's not a problem that I can't fix
‘Cause I can do in the mix

[Outro]
Everyone will see
That you're down with me
We'll have lots of fun together
You just wait and see
All you need in your dog collar (With diamonds on it, baby)
Everyone will see
That you're down with me
We'll have lots of fun together
You just wait and see
All you need in your dog collar (With diamonds on it, baby)

It's the doggy style
How we doin' this

It's the doggy style
How we doin' this

[Verse 1]
Dear God, life, love, the universe
Whatever name you like to use
We ask that you allow tonight to be another one of our best shows
We're grateful for what we get to do
Please allow the lights to be perfect, the sound to be perfect
And my fingers to hit all the right keys
I remember writing all these little songs in my notebook
And now these people pay to see me
That's just crazy, you must admit
Before that first deal, before those hits
Tone and I would wrap our arms around each other backstage
And Big Sean would say words like this
I didn't understand though, mama raised me a atheist
Which is fine, but I now think maybe it's
More to life than the things you can touch and feel
To me, God's just life and love, it's real
Not a old white man in the sky
That's how I used to think about it, but it didn't feel right
It's 9:08, we getting kinda late, so we open up our eyes and say

[Chorus]
Amen (Amen)
For the life, the love, the spirit
Amen (Amen)
For the things my eyes don't see
Amen (Amen)
For the ones no longer with us
Amen (Amen)
Please say a prayer for me

[Verse 2]
Dear Jesus, Allah, Krishna, Buddha
Whatever name you like to say
Please grant your heavenly love and sweet peace
To the family of Jessica Joe May
Six years ago, she wrote me and said she was my biggest fan
And she wouldn't go to sleep if I didn't hit her back
So I said, "Thanks, boo, go to sleep, you got school"
A friendship started, but ended too soon
Just a child, she used to tweet me every day
Draw me little pictures, say "I hope you feel okay"
I bet she never knew that I was going through some shit
My family was pissed at me and I almost quit
On that November night 'til I saw what she tweeted
"Keep making good music," that was just what I needed
You know I never even told her "Thank you," and I don't know why
'Cause on August 26th, Jessica died
I never thought that some fan on Twitter
Would give me a broken heart, but Lord, I miss her
When you opening the gates up, don't forget her
And save me a spot; soon, I'll be right there with her

[Chorus]
Amen (Amen, amen)
For the life, the love, the spirit
Amen (Amen)
For the things my eyes don't see
Amen (Amen)
For the ones no longer with us
Amen (Amen)
Please say a prayer for me

[Verse 3]
Dear Ra, Jehova, Dao, Brahma
Whichever name that you prefer
My big sister is a real light in the world
So yes, Lord, this is for her
I used to think she was crazy
All that hippie shit that she was on
Tying yourself to trees, man, I thought it was wrong
While I was flying 'round the world tryna get famous
You volunteered in New Orleans when the hurricane hit
Helping displaced kids
And people interview me while she remains nameless
Hmm, I didn't always get it
You lived in such a bad hood that I was 'fraid to visit
Uh, but on the side of your crib
You started a garden for all them little kids
And you taught 'em to grow fruits and veggies for they families
And here I am, worrying about a GRAMMY
I'll never forget that February night
I was in the studio with J. Cole, they were prepping the mic
You hit me with that text saying we needed to speak
I thought you were pregnant, I was prepping a speech
But it was something different that you had to say
Michael, I'm in love with a woman, I'm gay
Searching for the words in my head
When I found 'em, this is what I said
"I just want you to know that I love you
That's no matter what, Mom and Dad do too
And I got your back until my last day
And the universe does too," that's why I say

[Chorus]
Amen (Amen)
For the life, the love, the spirit
Amen (Amen)
For the things my eyes don't see
Amen (Amen)
For the ones no longer with us
Amen (Amen)
Please say a prayer for me

[Verse 1]
If you're ever feeling lonely
Don't forget to call on me
Through all the years I've known you
You've always been good to me

[Bridge]
Sha-la-lah
Yesterday's tears
You're over the sad years

[Verse 2]
Don't worry cause there's always someone
To take your troubles away
It's easier to share than worry
It's always better that way

[Bridge]
Sha-la-lah
Yesterday's tears
You're over the sad years
Want you to know
I want you to know
I want you to know
I'll always be there

Trippin' out on this LSD
Takin' the journey beyond the weed
I float around 'till we find the key
Couple girls, they my family
Here I am, here I am
Holdin' the bean since I was ten
Open your mouth for the stars and then
Hop on the board and we soarin' in
Nigga can never be tamed, I fall the hard

Watch out for shady cops
And I pimp for the fallen, no stolen, my car

Seasons changing, summer starts to leave
Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, and spring
80 degrees
Warmin' up to me
I fell deep, sun ain't have to leave
Open my eyes and see, I can walk on water
Made it back from shore, I can float from the water,
Father, lift me up, don't let me drown

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh yeah, ooh yeah
Who really loves me? Somebody loves me (Ooh yeah)
Who really wants me? Who really cares about me?

Yeah, I remember when you let me buy my grannie's house
You ain't my nigga if you ain't ever been by my grandma's house (No)
This ain't real love if we never fuck on my grandma's couch (No)
Nobody loves me, can't trust nobody
Don't want no fake niggas around me, don't need nobody (Yeah)

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Seasons changing, summer starts to leave
Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, and spring

Gettin' too much cash, not to upgrade percentages and salaries
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, oh
All I ever wanted is someone to be genuine (Uh, uh)
And to truly show me love, gotta be high like some Seroquel
Don't take nothin' from us, I don't got time to be watchin' them
Ooh, the way she walkin' in heels, can't keep up, uh, uh
I see them watchin' me

[Chorus: Ant Clemons & Young Thug]
Seasons changing, summer starts to leave (Uh, uh)
Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, and spring (Uh, uh)

Open my eyes and see, I can walk on water
Made it back from shore, I can float from the water,
Father, lift me up, don't let me drown

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I chose not to be a slave
Dropped the Wave Runners, now we run the wave

Nobody gon' ruin me
I just called my wife up, let's get Hoover free
I put all my ice up and my Louis V
I just copped my mom a crib, I'm back over East
Let me get your ear like Holyfield
From the home of Soldier Field

I know you hit me when I'm lonely (Lonely), lift me off my feet

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
We began after the storm inside
Lay the land (Yeah-ah), it's just the morning light (Oh, yeah)

Bigger sign, bet they gon' bleed now

[Verse: Kanye West]
Aliens, double to sign off
Better time, 'bout to take time off

Order a bleeding nine, tell her, "Don't leave tonight"

Took her out, order her something with eyes out
They was done, we the one, we just on
Louis thong, Lebanon, we become, what they done?
Duh-na-na, duh, feel it, feel it, feel it
This ain't our planet, that's why I kill it
Kill it, animals, kill it, ozone, kill it
Blood, spill it, somethin' you deal with

Alex Jones said the same shit and fried, oh shit!
Alien, pyramid, fly off, take off
Break off, Kit Kat, take off, wake up
Make off, they go, say go, get makeov'

Message, message, bless it
Don't stress it, don't stress shit
Don't test it, don't test this
Don't touch this, man they Hammer time
On the dotted line, on the camera time
When it's out of line and they meant it right
Done it down to nine, on the dotted line
Want a better line and I'm feeling right
Kill the feeling, right, oh and I made it rhyme
'Cause I met a time and you're out of time
And you wear the line and he out of line
But he set it off, on the Adderall
When they got it all, set it off y'all

Good evening and welcome to Paris

[Verse 1]
Ohoh
Hey fellas, have you heard the news?
You know that Annie's back in town
It won't take long, just watch and see
How the fellas lay their money down

[Verse 2]
Her style is new, but the face the same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes, a different smile
Like that of one who knows

[Verse 3]
Well, it's been ten years or maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue

[Verse 4]
Some people cry and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rolling along
With the grace of the Lord above

[Verse 5]
People talking all around
About the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say
I know where their jive is at

[Verse 6]
One thing I do have on my mind
If you can clarify, please do
It's the way you call me by another guy's name
When I try to make love to you, yeah
Oh, but it ain't no use, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 7]
Mmm, work so hard I couldn't unwind
Get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand times
However hard I tried

[Outro]
Heartbreaker: your time has come
Can't take your evil way
Go away, Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker!
Heartbreaker!
Heart!

I've been dazed and confused so long, it's not true
I wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Lots of people talk, and few of them know
Soul of a woman was created below

[Verse 2]
I said you hurt and abuse, telling all of your lies
Run 'round, sweet baby, how you hypnotize
I don't know where you're going, only know just where you've been
Sweet little baby, I want you again

[Verse 3]
Every day I work so hard, bringing home my hard-earned pay
Try to love you, baby, but you push me away
Don't know where you're going, only know where you've been
Sweet little baby, I want you again, yeah

[Instrumental break]

[Guitar Solo]
Ooooh, yeah

[Verse: Kanye West]
... proclaim
Jesus, Jesus name
And this in Jesus' name
Your name, we proclaim (Yeah, yeah)
Everybody in here
Throw your hands in the air
Ch-ch- cheer, ch-ch-cheer
He died for us
The Devil lied to us
But we know God gon' be the one that ride for us
We need him more, we work from one to four
Locked up, now it's one and three
Thirteenth amendment, end it on me, that's free

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Set my people free, set my people free, free
Jesus gon' set my people free, free
Set my people free, set my people free, free
Thirteenth amendment, gotta end it, that's on me (Uh, huh)
Set my people free, set my people free, free
Set my people free, set my people free, free
Thirteenth amendment, gotta end it

Solo

[Verse 1]
Don't blink, bitch
Real niggas on the brink of extinction
Livin' like he on a mothafuckin' hit list
Gunnin' for your bitch next, finnin' off a pissed ex
Declining your lips stretched
Mr. Anonymous probably sent your clique threats
Fist full of dollars, that collar sit on his thin neck
And most imitate me, I'm popular, so I trend set
The smoke irritating my ocular while the pen jets
Plane switch lit as these lane switchin'
High as your praise given and daddies who stayed distant
We stayed in LA, that's hard liquor and fame, women
You skinny, you weight lifting, 

[?] and gain tension
See, me, I was raised different
Black elite beatin' down your block with the bass kickin'
Highway to hell with the tank empty
Niggas faces never was pain stricken
Even though that heart 'bout as dark as the days endin', remain tinted

[Verse 2]
Fade to black, grey to white
Hungry like I need a motherfuckin' place to stay tonight
Out the water screaming "Fuck a satiated appetite"
Sweatshirt got the block hotter than some cajun spice
'Bout as hot as bacon pop
Steam a couple hundred spliffs my nigga Sagan copped
Scheming on a mouth full of gold and some pagan thoughts
Drinking, head spinnin' like dreidel top
Keep my eyes open like the gate is on a vacant lot
So I can see these shady niggas soft as baby apricots
Reassert I'm hard as conversation with a racist cop
Out the stomach, hit the ground runnin' and I'm stayin' in socks
Junk still shakin', tell Lativa send a baker box
Plus, ill circa bag, lunch and a bus pass
Tatted half cabs in the shadow of a mustache
Double cuff kakis and a sale price Huf hat
Pushin' down Fax, lookin' dirtier than smudged glass
But that was as an ashy sophomore
Cashed his first check and finally learned what them pockets for
Profit, lock it down, that's word to apartment doors
Coke and soda rockin' 'til it's harder than some mommas' chores
Ridin' 'round town shotgun in a armored Ford
Doin' drive-bys armed with nothing but a sharpened sword
Wolf Gang before you ask me what I'm barking for
Plus the fuse sorta similar to John Stockton's shorts
Featuring Danny Swain

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Don't blink, bitch
Real niggas on the brink of extinction
Livin' like he on a mothafuckin' hit list
Gunnin' for your bitch next, finnin' off a pissed ex
Declining your lips stretched
Mr. Anonymous probably sent your clique threats
Fist full of dollars, that collar sit on his thin neck
And most imitate me, I'm popular, so I trend set
The smoke irritating my ocular while the pen jets
Plane switch lit as these lane switchin'
High as your praise given and daddies who stayed distant
We stayed in LA, that's hard liquor and fame, women
You skinny, you weight lifting, 

[?] and gain tension
See, me, I was raised different
Black elite beatin' down your block with the bass kickin'
Highway to hell with the tank empty
Niggas faces never was pain stricken
Even though that heart 'bout as dark as the days endin', remain tinted

[Verse 2: Danny!]

[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt]
Fade to black
But that was as an ashy sophomore
Cashed his first check and finally learned what them pockets for
Profit, lock it down, that's word to apartment doors
Coke and soda rockin' 'til it's harder than some mommas' chores
Ridin' 'round town shotgun in a armored Ford
Doin' drive-bys armed with nothing but a sharpened sword
Wolf Gang before you ask me what I'm barking for
Plus the fuse sorta similar to John Stockton's shorts

[Instrumental Psychedelic Sequence]

You've been burnin', honey, I've been learnin'
You've been foolin', baby, I've been droolin'

Keep it coolin', baby
Keep it coolin', baby
Keep it coolin', baby
Ah-keep it coolin', baby
Ah, ohhhh, hoaoh.....

[Verse 1]
And if I say to you tomorrow
Take my hand, child, come with me
It's to a castle I will take you
Where what's to be, they say will be

[Chorus]
Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky, ...

[?]
But the wind won't blow, you really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine, by taking our time
Oh, oh..

[Verse 2]
And if you say to me tomorrow
Oh, what fun it all would be
Then what's to stop us, pretty baby
But what is and what should never be?

[Chorus]
Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky, ...

[?]
But the wind won't blow, you really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine, by taking our time
Ah, oh....

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
So if you wake up with the sunrise
And all your dreams are still as new
And happiness is what you need so bad
Girl, the answer lies with you, yeah

[Chorus]
Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky, ...

[?]
But the wind won't blow, you really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine, by taking our time
Aaah, bom, bom, bom,....

[Outro]
But the wind won't blow, and we really shouldn't go
And it only goes to show
Catch the wind, we're going to see it spin, we're going to...sail, leave today
Do do do, bop bop a do-oh. My my my my my my yeah
Everybody I know seems to know me well
But they're never going to know that I move like hell
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby. Oh lord
Baby baby babe. Huh? ....

[Verse 1]
Hey fellas, have you heard the news?
You know that Annie's back in town
It won't take long, just watch and see
How the fellas lay their money down

[Verse 2]
Her style is new, but the face the same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes, a different smile
Like that of one who knows

[Verse 3]
Well, it's been ten years or maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue

[Verse 4]
Some people cry, and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rolling along
With the grace of the Lord above

[Verse 5]
People talking all around
About the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say
I know where their jive is at

[Verse 6]
One thing I do have on my mind
If you can clarify, please do
It's the way you call me another guy's name
When I try to make love to you, yeah

I try to make love, but it ain't no use
Give it to me, give it

[Instrumental break]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 7]
Mm, work so hard I couldn't unwind
Get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand times
However hard I tried

[Outro]
Heartbreaker; your time has come
Can't take your evil way
Go away, heartbreaker
Heartbreaker!
Heartbreaker!
Heart!

[Verse 1]
The leaves are falling all around, time I was on my way
Thanks to you, I'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go, the autumn moon lights my way
For now I smell the rain, and with it pain, and it's headed my way
Ah, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do

[Chorus]
Ramble on, and now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on, gotta find the queen of all my dreams

[Verse 2]
Got no time to for spreading roots
The time has come to be gone
And though "Our health" we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

[Chorus]
Ramble on, and now the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
I gotta ramble on, I gotta find the queen of all my dreams

[Bridge]
I tell you no lie

[Verse 3]
Mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old, when magic filled the air
'Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair
But Gollum and the evil one crept up and slipped away with her
Her, her, yeah
Ah, there's nothing I can do now
I guess I'll keep on

[Outro]
Ramblin', I'm gonna shake
I gotta find my baby
I'm gonna ramble on, I'm gonna sing my song
Gonna work my way, going 'round the world,  baby, baby
Do do do do do, my baby
Do do do do do do do do
Do dee do dee do dee do dee do dee, yeah
I gotta keep searching for my baby
I gotta keep on searching for my baby
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Oooh, my my, my my, my my, my my, yeah
I keep ramblin', baby
I keep ramblin', baby
I keep ramblin', baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Mmm, that's all, that's all
Mmmmm

Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
You smell just like lilac wine, little bit of nostalgia
Rewind back time to when I first learned to love ya
She passin' me by, she burnin' rubber
These slideshows in my mind, whoa
She play it cool, but her eyes don't lie though (Better drive slow)
If you wanna take a ride on the high road (Yeah) (Whoa)
And your mind so passionate, your love what I'm after, and
That feelin' so unfamiliar, I only imagine it
Dream girl, you're my make-believe girl

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Unknown Man]
I'ma bet it all on you, I'ma cheer you up
Why you bein' so blue? Yeah, I'ma put you in the mood
Baby girl, them butterflies stick like glue
Butterflies (Butterflies), butterflies stick like glue (Butterflies)
Butterflies (Butterflies), butterflies stick like glue

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, okay
Beauty queen, beauty queen, straight out of a movie scene
Touchin' on yo' body, I could feel you in a lucid dream
This my imagination, ooh, you keep me fascinated
You are a forbidden fruit, I be apple tastin'
She is glowin', babe, I think I need a moment
I keep you open late, do you even know my name?
(Why am I a stranger?) Yeah
She dancin' on the street, it's her favorite ol' song
And she playin' out the stereo, the radio on
Do she love me like I love her? Use me when she need a lover?
Yeah, she got me under her spell, goin' rounds, ring a bell

[Chorus: Mac Miller, Kilo Kish, Unknown Man]
I'ma bet it all on you, I'ma cheer you up
Why you bein' so blue? Yeah, I'ma put you in the mood
Baby girl, them butterflies stick like glue
Butterflies (Butterflies) (Butterflies)
Butterflies stick like glue (Yeah) (Butterflies)
Butterflies (Butterflies) (Butterflies)
Butterflies stick like glue (Whoa)

[Bridge: Mac Miller & Kilo Kish]
There's no emotion powerful as love (Such a good point, Mac, you already said it)
There's no emotion powerful as love (I could write a cliché, but they already got it, pathetic)
There's no emotion powerful as love (Just in case: key to life, peace and love, white tux, white top)
As love, as love (Until the next time, let's keep it cool, my love)

[Outro: Kilo Kish]
Um, but really, Mac, you're kind of a bitch though
Just saying
Okay, bye

[Instrumental Intro]

[Chorus]
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

[Verse 1]
When I'm driving in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's telling me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no, oh no, no, no!
Hey, hey, hey! That's what I'll say!

[Chorus]
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

[Verse 2]
When I'm watching my TV
And a man comes on and tells me
How white my shirts can be
Well he can't be a man cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I can't get no, oh no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey, that's what I say

[Chorus]
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

[Outro]
When I'm riding round the world
And I'm doing this and I'm signing that
And I'm trying to make some girl
Who tells me baby, better come back, maybe next week
'Cause you see, I'm on a losing streak
I can't get no, oh no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey! That's what I'll say!
I can't get no (x3)
I can't get no satisfaction
No satisfaction (x3)
I can't get no

[Intro: Young Thug]
Yeah
Ayy, guess what I been doin'?
Hold on, I'ma put you down as soon as the beat drop (Yeah)
Right here

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug & Future]
I been drinkin' lean 10 years consistently
I been poppin' pills 10 years consistently
Breakin' all the rules, won't give 'em decency
She said fuck her soft, give her some decency
I bought 20 tabs on the regular (Yeah)
Real street nigga, but I ain't regular (Yeah)
Drinkin' on lean, Lord of the Rings, ga-ga-gasoline (On God)
Baddies on my schedule, my bitch say "Sir, yes sir"

[Chorus: Young Thug, Future & Both]
I been drinkin' lean 10 years, consistency (Syrup)
I been poppin' beans 10 years, consistency (That syrup)

I been drinkin' lean 10 years, consistent lean
I been drinkin' lean 10 years, consistent lean (Ayy)

[Verse 1: Future]
Ooh, my ice stay biting
Woah, I'm strapped like lightning
Whole lot of jewels, ooh, a whole lot of jewels, ooh, ooh (On god)
Re-up, T up the cash with my feet up (Yeah), oh
Put a whole pint in a 16 liter (Suit up), ooh
First off, we was at our worst off
Pull a bitch dress up, nigga make it squirt off
Hold up, they could never touch us
They could never search us, geeked off acid (Acid)
Hold up, they never approached us
They never robbed us, hold up, they cappin' (Brrr)
I done got too geeked up, I done start talkin' to myself, I'm ahead of myself

[Chorus: Young Thug, Future & Both]
I been drinkin' lean 10 years, consistent lean
I been drinkin' lean 10 years, consistent lean
I been drinkin' lean 10 years, consistent lean (Ayy)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I turned the Bentley to cream, spray a nigga with the oil sheen
I been drinkin' purple lean, mix it with a lil' codeine
Panoramic, yeah, I heard you ratted
They'll turn off on all of your partners
I gave that bitch Gucci for nothing
I saw you through Gucci binoculars
I blowed off the roof with no chopper
Extended clip for the rasta
Devilish chain for a rockstar
I made the gang in a roster
Red and blue flags like a cop car
You know they gon' move if I call 'em
I pass all the swoo to my partners
I pass all the swoo to my partners
You pull your pants down and get caught
You play with my shit, you'll get popped
I didn't fuck your bitch, I got top
Your bitch with my dawg, she gettin' tossed
I done made myself a big boss
Syracuse diamonds cost a loft
36 tick-tocks, Gunna Gunna crip walk
12 chains spaced out, fucked her at Ritz, top (Woo)
I'm a gangster, got big nuts (Yeah)
I ain't gotta push it up (Woo)
I ain't callin' none of this luck
In Slime We Trust

[Chorus: Young Thug & Future & Both]
I been drinkin' lean 10 years consistently
I been poppin' pills 10 years consistently
Breakin' all the rules, won't give 'em decency
She said fuck her soft, give her some decency
I been drinkin' lean 10 years, consistent lean
I been drinkin' lean 10 years, consistent lean
I been drinkin' lean 10 years, consistent lean (Ayy)

[Verse 1: Drake]
People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekend's here, started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing, oh

[Bridge: Drake]
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down

[Hook: Drake]
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time

[Verse 2: Drake]
They keep telling me don't save you, if I ignore all that advice
Then something isn't right, then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right
Even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too
There's things we might discover
Cause you got a past and I do too, we're perfect for each other

[Bridge: Drake]
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down

[Hook: Drake]
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Cause to her I'm just a rapper, and soon she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by it's cover
I don't wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her, and she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile, but I wan' know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last; Tunechi

[Hook: Drake]
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time

[Verse 1]
Shoulda spent more nights
Coulda changed your life
We woulda been alright
All these shoulda coulda wouldas
In her ear one time
Prolly wastin’ my time
'Cause she heard it all
'Cause she heard it all
Girl, I coulda changed your life
But she heard it all
Well, I'ma say it anyway shawty

[Refrain]
I’m from the city
Where we were never taught to love
You ain’t gotta be in love to fuck
Girl, I’m just tryna say
I’m from the city, oh
Where the money makes a difference
But it never made us different, oh

[Chorus]
I'm taking you home tonight
I want to make sure that you're alright
Looks like a cold, cold wind is blowing in
I'm taking you home tonight

[Verse 1]
Like a train that's left the tracks
The world is falling apart
I'd gladly help to put it back
But tell me where to start

[Chorus]
I'm taking you home (yeah!) tonight
I want to make sure that you're alright
Well, the coat you're wearing's way too thin
I'm taking you home tonight

[Verse 2]
I read the bad news everyday
It's getting harder to cry
Sometimes I'd like to look away
But I can't close my eyes

[Chorus]
I'm taking you home (yeah!) tonight
I want to make sure that you're alright
Won't you notify my next of kin?
I'm taking you home tonight

[Bridge]
Say yes tonight
Say yes if my suggestion is right
Say yes to me
If that's the way you want it to be

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm taking you home (yeah!) tonight
I want to make sure that you're alright
Looks like a cold, cold wind is blowing in
I'm taking you home tonight

[Verse 3]
Well, life goes by at such a pace
The troubles seem to increase
I know that we can find a place
Where we can get some peace

[Chorus]
I'm taking you home (yeah!) tonight
I want to make sure that you're alright
Looks like a cold, cold wind is blowing in
I'm taking you home tonight

[Bridge]
So say yes tonight
Say yes if my suggestion is right
Say yes to me
If that's the way you want it to be

[Outro]
Well, I'm taking you home (home!) tonight
I want to make sure that you're alright
They say a cold, cold wind is blowing in
The coat you're wearing's way too thin
Notify my next of kin
I'm taking you home tonight

[Intro]
One, two, three, four!

[Verse 1]
She was always in a hurry
Never took the time to look around
She was always one to worry and fret
Staring at the ground

[Verse 2]
Every minute, she'd be rushing
Someone always breathing down her neck
Felt like everyone was pushing her down
Keeping her in check

[Verse 3]
How could she leave? She's gotta stay
Somebody has to sit and wait
Deep in a dream, she hears a voice
"It's not too late to celebrate"

[Pre-Chorus]
Uncontrollable laughter (Not too late to celebrate)
Running 'round in her head (No one said you've got to wait)
This is what she was after (Not too late to celebrate)
Not too late, not too late

[Chorus 1]
It's never too late to celebrate
No one said you've got to wait
Allow me to congratulate you, baby
Yeah, yeah

It's never too late to celebrate
And no one said you had to wait
Allow me to congratulate you, baby

[Chorus 2]
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late, never too late

Never too late to celebrate
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late, never too late

[Verse 4]
Now she doesn't have to hurry
She can do exactly what she wants
Ask her why she doesn't worry or fret
This is her response:

[Pre-Chorus]
Uncontrollable laughter
Running 'round in her head
This is what she was after
Not too late, not too late

[Chorus 1]
It's never too late to celebrate
No one said you've gotta wait
Allow me to congratulate you, baby
Yeah

It's never too late to celebrate
Allow me to congratulate
It's never too late to celebrate you, baby

[Outro]
Never too late to celebrate

Falling down without you, can you pick me up?
And now I can't get you off my head, girl, you're coming...

[Chorus]
Coming through my speaker, speaker (Yeah)
Got me tryna reach ya, reach ya (Tryna reach ya)

[Intro: Kanye West]
Uh

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Pardison Fontaine]
When the people don't have land, they settle for brands
They want Jesus polo sport and Obama again
My foresight is incredible
She pull the foreskin back-back like it's edible
Democracy is just a simulation, the government
I deserved over a billion, I'm lovin' it
She got lightskin, nipples yeah, that's my favorite
Shawn White lookin' like he's working for the agents
Wish a white dude wouldn't tell me 'bout black lives
Wasn't my choice when my parents got me baptized
Black oppression is a business
I see they want to test me like the Litmus
While Noah be fixin' the EQ
I'm just waiting on the day I finally get Me-Too'd
'Cause nigga did a lot of shit, uh
They say I don't belong in politics, uh (Look)

[Verse 2: Pardison Fontaine]
Came in this bitch just to rip heads off, ayy
Check on your head and now you getting checked off (Bling)
Jump in the red Porche (Skrrt), sped off (Hey)
Pulled the poodle to your noodle, now you drippin' red sauce (Bah)
I don't listen to your rap, got too many lies in it (Facts)
Don't you come to my hood, you wouldn't survive in it (No)
They don't fuck with me 'cause they can't fuck with me, I get it
Would say your girl pussy wet, but that'd be dry snitchin' (Hey)
This time last year I was dead broke (I was dead broke)
I was one day away from tryna sell coke (Sell coke)
Prolly woulda messed it up, been dead or in jail (Jail)
I was finna sell yay', then Ye hit me on the cell
Like, "Damn, you the truth dawg, alley-oop dawg"
We could run this whole shit, like Dre and Snoop Dogg, ayy
Ayy, cash out
You know the hoes love to see you bring that
You know the road when a nigga been there
You know they all love a nigga when ya
Rollin' in my hoopty, it get me from A to B
I'm good in my hood, them niggas don't play with me
This is Pardi, Flacko, 'Ye, them niggas they came to see
We the ones who set the trends, what they gon' say to me? (Hey)
What they gon' say to me?
We the ones who set the trends, man, that's just the way it be
Ayy, ayy, pay it tall, pay it free (Ayy, ayy)
In this bitch, a pregnancy (Ayy, ayy)
Fuck a lame, legacy (Ayy, ayy)

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
I'm dead nice, should be paid off of net price alone
Visit financing, get my debts right (Debts right)
Visit your mama after, 'cause the head right
I spread the best advice, invest type (Word)
Woulda got Kanye West outta debt twice (Nah)
'Cause I'm just tryna be the greatest genius since Yeezus
But terms of condition will go over heads like the set price (Huh?)
Hoes like the set price (Think about that)
Comparisons to fake me's, embarrassing (Bitch ass)
If it matters, I'm embarrassing
I think about the state of mind, think about my mind state, it's passive (Passive)
A few millis spent on bad habits, the other half on taxes
And that goes to anybody with money in that bracket (What?)
Think about the state of rapping, the freshmen's in all the classes
All the super seniors mumblin' rappin'
Mumblin' and ramblin'
I can't find it hard to-
I find it hard to find actual talent (Huh?)
I find it challenging to find an actual challenge (Huh?)
Fuck you
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Lord Christ, we need you now more than ever
You working for God or are you working for the Devil?
Southside, we gon' always stay ghetto
Fornicating, got my girlfriend preggo
Walter Peyton wrote the sweetest thing I know
Before her, I was doing things solo
Before it was true, I might bring back the Polo
Yeezy is the number one brand with no logo
I be at the church, all Dickies, like a cholo
Now let me get to these walls so I can pole vault

[Chorus: Choir]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Outro: Choir]
Down, walking around, yeah, yeah
And it isn’t the place

[Chorus]
I didn't realize
I didn't realize

[Verse 1]
Just when I thought I knew what was going on
You cut my heart out, you cut my head off

[Chorus]
I didn't realize
I didn't realize

[Verse 2]
Forgive me for the faith I had in us
What do you do when everything is not enough?

[Chorus]
I didn't realize
I didn't realize
I didn't realize
I didn't realize

[Verse 1]
This is not what I planned in trusting you
You lied, you lied, you lied
You lied, you lied, you lied

[Chorus]
It all ends today
I don't feel anymore

[Verse 2]
And this is what I get for loving you
You lied, oooh, you lied

[Chorus]
It all ends today
I don't feel anymore
It all ends today
I don't feel anymore

[Chorus]
It all ends today
I don't feel anymore
It all ends today

[Outro]
I don't feel…
I don't feel…
I don't feel…
(I don't feel)

[Intro]
(This gon' sound terrible on this phone and shit, can you play–, can you play it again?)

[Chorus]
Ain't no light on a one night star, one night star
No lights ever shone this far, one night star
They say the stars don't shine this far, one night star
They say the shine don't shine this far, this far down, this far down
Little light for one night star, one night bar
They say the stars don't shine this far, this far down

[Verse]
Now lay me down with another clown
Over summer now, silver's not the summer now
Bust down a cutie, nights on a duty

[?] the business man, family on the golf course
Next morning as he shows no remorse
With his daughter, oughta be ashamed

[?] oughta be the game
Little nose for the colder one
Later that night, he was finna put a hole in one

[Chorus]
Little lights all in one night star, one night star
They say the stars don't shine that far, that far down
Little life for a one night star, my one night star
He said, "Will you be my one night star?", the prettiest by far, prettiest by far

[Outro]
Proof that beauty is the worst curse known to man
Beauty is the 

[?] on the sand

[?]
Screaming out "fore!", golf hit the sand
Screaming out, "Pour out this for 

[?]"
Golf - I do all comparisons to him on the golf course the next day
Like he ain't just had a prostitute the previous night and shit
You know?

[Intro]
Yeah, and alone
Oh, out again
Bed in the morning
I tell myself

[Chorus]
One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him
You ain't getting over him

[Verse 1]
Talkin' in my sleep at night
Makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out
Hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

[Pre-Chorus]
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me so I tell myself, I tell myself

[Chorus]
One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him
You ain't getting over him

[Hook]
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself

[Verse 2]
I keep pushin' forwards
But he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standing back from it
I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)

[Pre-Chorus]
But my love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me so I tell myself, I tell myself
(I do, I do, I do)

[Chorus]
One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him
You ain't getting over him

[Hook]
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself

[Verse 1]
Lucky me
If they want my spot, then they gotta come for me
Just know I want this shit more than whatever it is you want from me
And the only thought at night that comforts me is starvin' whoever's huntin' me
Shit, lucky me, to be rich in a world where nothing's free
And separated from hell by one degree
Surrounded by niggas who did first degree
And the other ones that never got they first degree, sheesh
Lucky me (Nigga!)
Yeah, I done slashed hoes like I'm Slash on some rock star shit
Even bought Slash old crib, that's rock star as it gets
And have my hands on the R&B legends you couldn't handle
Whether you do music or not, you wish you could sample
And I had to live through the scandals
Public humiliations and breakups on camera
It's a living nightmare when your dream girl has to get canceled
And you gotta delete all the photos and shit like you never Instagrammed it
And you get off-track but somehow you gotta stay transit, ha
Man, lucky me
I was diagnosed with a heart disease at 19
Could barely stand on my feet
Doctors said they had to cut it open, put a pacemaker on it to put it back on beat
'Til my mama took me to holistic doctors and they prescribed me magnesium for two weeks
Went back to the regular doctors and they said, "Huh, damn, looks like we don't need to proceed"
That's how I know that western medicine weak
Man, lucky me, to be the chosen one
And saved for the special occasions like I was Opus One
You know, and I'ma live forever like Walt Disney, the frozen one
Done flew so many times past the limit, I didn't even know it was one
And face our problems head-on when they told us to run
And ran it up in a city where no one would come
When I had literally died but then came back alive
And it's the furthest thing that I know from over and done
And I don't even have to say it, you know where I'm from, bitch (Yeah, yeah)
Lucky me, lucky who? (Lucky) Lucky, true
It's a wonder what prayer, working smart and love can do
And y'all got an efficient and humble crew
And you got a long list of the things y'all wanna do
Shit, who knows, lucky me could turn into lucky you
We turned nothing to something so much it's nothing new
I know lady luck so well, I swear that's like my bottom bitch, number two
Doing what we love and choose with lots to lose and more to prove
Ain't running from nothing but haven't lost sight of the finish line that we been runnin' to
Lil' bitch, this Detroit-fucking-2
My thoughts is all-black, yeah, I'm back to the roots
Fuck your white flag, ho, I don't want no truce
And we all in the huddle, they like, "It's on you"
Hm, lucky me (Me), pressure's what I eat
Ain't no roses at my feet, just the blood on the concrete, look (Hit-Boy on the beat, so bitch you gotta go berserk)

[Chorus]
The mission is covert
I stuck to the code and you don't know the code word
Once they start me up then just know that it's over (Woah, woah)
My soul is on solace, surrounded by angels and soldiers on soldiers
World turned me cold, game turned me colder
Sittin' courtside lookin' like I'm finna be the fuckin' future owner (Woah)
Cup runneth over and she comin' over (Woah)
And she told me that her lil' bro wanna be me when he older (That's facts)

[Post-Chorus]
Look, I ain't gon' hold you, though
Put in my family, I feel like Utopia
Falling in love with a slut is my phobia
My whole team first class, so it ain't no coachin' us

[Verse 2]
Woah there, don't go there, now slow down, lil' brodie
I know you don't know me
I'm buffed up, my chest up, I feel like Hulk Hogan
I walk in the building like everybody owe me
Move heaven on Earth, this shit feel like erosion
The Don, I'm the king, I'm consultin' the soldiers
You talk to me nice and not real, I'm insulted
I bet on myself, ain't no way my hand's folding
What's a limitation? Fuck your validation
I don't got a figure, God flow, got it renovated
Demon slayer and my bitch slayin', legendary, it's insinuated
Two guards outside barricaded while I'm serenadin' (Yeah)
Paradise covin' while I'm stroking
Pussy tight, I'm claustrophobic
She so damn down and devoted
Got me wondering what's her motives (What's her—)
Remember my feelings don't mean shit to none of my goals, so I gotta stay focused
The city is soulless, this shit get too vulgar
Seen bodies wrapped up in them white sheets, no COVID

[Chorus]
The mission is covert
I stuck to the code and you don't know the code word
Once they start me up then just know that it's over (Woah, woah)
My soul is on solace, surrounded by angels and soldiers on soldiers
World turned me cold, game turned me colder
Sittin' courtside lookin' like I'm finna be the fuckin' future owner (Woah)
Cup runneth over and she comin' over (Woah)
And she told me that her lil' bro wanna be me when he older (That's facts)

[Post-Chorus]
Look, I ain't gon' hold you, though
Put in my family, I feel like Utopia
Falling in love with a slut is my phobia
My whole team first class, so it ain't no coachin' us (Yeah), yeah

[Outro]
My whole team first class so it ain't no coachin' us
Nobody over us, 'cept the ones we lost that stay watchin' over us (Amen)
Prayin' hands (Love you guys so much), prayin' hands (Yeah)
Say "Amen" (Yeah)
Got a lot to do, but she gon' wait on me (Wait on me)
Legendary (Shit), lucky me (Yeah)

[Intro]
Wheezy beats

[Chorus]
I just made a load of bitches go fuck on my daddy, yeah (Woo)
Show 'em I'm not average, I'm fuckin' on a Kardashian, yeah
I just want my 

[?] new ring like a Kardashian, yeah (Woo)
I just might record her suckin' dick so she can't pass me, yeah (Woo)
I'ma just gon' go droppin' drippin' drop the T top
I'ma just gon' serve that nigga yola, wipe his Reeboks
He got caught on camera killin' niggas, yeah, but we not
And I'm saucin' bad, bitch, I'm flyer than a eagle

[Verse]
Upset stomach, got three stripes just like Adidas
Exes say they miss her bad but they never see her
Bitches say my bitch is boring then they wanna be her (What?)
Bitches say my bitch a fraud then turn 'round and wanna be her (Woo)
I'm just 'bout that cash talk, I'm signing checks (Signing checks)
I don't fuck with planes, I'm on a private jet (Woo)
Throw a private part, call it Project X (Project X)
Pull up in a Rover then demand respect (Demand respect)
Dynasty, ran up them Gs
Drank you some lean, turn a ho to a freak
Karate-ooo, like Goku-eee (Okay)
Toilet stools, I'm shittin' on these
Dominos, got bad hoes
Been runnin' 'round with they pants down
They make that ass twirl 'round and 'round
I bought her so many bags, she could supply the town

[Intro]
In love with the money
In love with the money
In love with the money
In love with the money

[Pre-Chorus]
What's the call?
In love with the money, it's "Fuck 'em all"
Heard you fucked on my bro, I can't fuck with ya
I don't want her unless she gon' do the dawgs
I got everything I ever prayed for
Lil' shawty gon' suck it right through the draws
R.I.P. to the ones I forever lost
R.I.P. to the money, I ran it up

[Chorus]
If she bad, Michael Jack', I'ma let her know (Know)

I can't let her go (Uh-uh)

[Verse]
Yeah, on and on, she go on and on, on, on

Come collect the check then fuck it up, woah, woah, woah, woah
Yeah, new Benz, too bad, I'ma see you later, shawty
New Rick, new Raf, fuck about a hater, homie
I do what I do 'cause I am who I am
Yeah, I don't need a reason or an explanation

[Bridge]
And that's just the way it is, the way, the way
And that's just the way it is, the way, the way
Young and rich and on my own
And that's why she keep callin' my phone

[Pre-Chorus]
What's the call?
In love with the money, it's "Fuck 'em all"
Heard you fucked on my bro, I can't fuck with ya
I don't want her unless she gon' do the dawgs
I got everything I ever prayed for
Lil' shawty gon' suck it right through the draws
R.I.P. to the ones I forever lost
R.I.P. to the money, I ran it up

[Chorus]
If she bad, Michael Jack', I'ma let her know (Know)
And if she do how she say, then I can't let her go, woah

You know my favorite time to come through for you is the clutch
Last second, what a rush (Rush, rush), look
I'm the type to talk to the stars (I look up), straight up
These ain't tattoos, these are scars
My young dogs will tear you and the witnesses apart (Straight up)
They care 'bout starving more than they do 'bout a charge (Woah, woah, woah)
Me, I can't break a commitment (No)
I done seen people fuck up the whole team 'cause they couldn't play they position (Play your position)
Talking 'bout they didn't mean it, bitch, you know the road to hell was paved with good intentions
I see myself in my nemesis (See)
I contemplated forgiveness (No), I think I lost all my innocence (Yeah)
Ho, my life depend on this, this ain't no simple sucker shit (Woah)
Try and steal and you get bit, that's what you motherfucking get

Put my back against the wall just to see how much I've grown, dawg

[Chorus: Big Sean, Post Malone, Big Sean & Post Malone]

Better play it right, yeah, you better play it right

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
I was raised by the wolves (Wolves), paid all my dues (Dues)
Always in the game and never played by the rules (Rules)
Tried to make me leave (Leave), fell down to my knees (Knees)
Picked myself up and turned my back to the breeze, oh-ohh
Spent a milli' on a Mille, mama look at me (Ooh)
With all these diamond chokers, man, it's gettin' hard to breathe
Thought that you were family, cut some branches off my tree (Wow)
But if you in my circle, know I'll always be around ('Round)
Don't let me down (Down)
You said you'd die for me, well, there's the ground
Ice on my wrist, ice in my veins
But it's a cold, cold world, and you can be predator, you can be prey

[Chorus: Post Malone & Big Sean, Post Malone]
I was raised by the wolves, ate 'til they full (Ate 'til they full)
Run through the night, playin' with your life

Grabbed the beat, looped it up
Saw my check, scooped it up
Rock ignition, got to listen
Change position, start transmission

Point the camera, click the frame
Use a high asa, I like the grain
Flip the script, start to trip
Grabbed my hip, did the dip

Rent the car, go upstate
Hit the waterfall, jump in a lake
Step in the place, move the crowd
Cut the snake, walked right out

Another day slips by
Got to fix the mind
I've got the mind maligned
With I mean mine
Got to turn it around
Got to give back
Because this self-centered thing is keeping me off track
Take the one train, ride the double L
Go to Brooklyn, rock well
Jump the gun, call your bluff
Break the mold, a diamond in the rough

Ran the floor, grabbed a rock
Spot it up, shot the shot
Go pet Sam, said, "get off me"
Check the machine, "Adam this is coffee"

Brace myself, trace myself
Pace myself, lace myself
Check the mirror, start to melt
Jump back, kiss myself

Another day slips by
Got to fix the mind
I've got the mind maligned
With I mean mine
Got to turn it around
Got to give back
Because this self-centered thing is keeping me off track

Hug my Lois, brush her teeth
Read her books, put her to sleep
Pack her lunch, drop her at school
Head to the studio, turn on the pro-tools
Apple C, Apple V
Drop the beat, hit delete
Hit record, smorgasbord
Draw my sword, jump aboard

Grab the phone, call my dad
Shared some love, felt so glad
Went and called Freckles, and I told her I love her
Ran home, got under the covers

Another day slips by
Got to fix the mind
I've got the mind maligned
With I mean mine
Got to turn it around
Got to give back
Because this self-centered thing is keeping me off track
Lyrics from Snippets

[Snippet 1]
You're number one and there's one hundred
Everybody else want something
But I give everything you want nothing
So don't act like that its easy for you to just leave me like that
(—that, like that)

[Snippet 2]
Don't act like it's easy
For you to miss me like that

Baby, are you okay? Okay
Let me know now if you okay

[Intro]
Catch him slippin', take his life at a red light (Thugger, Thugger, baby)
Thugger, Thugger, niggas
Yeah, Thugga (Ha)

[Chorus]
Cut it with the coke then you can go buy a quart
Yo' girl don't wanna leave, she stay upstairs like I'm from New York

Now I feel like a Mason with a–
Hundred bands of cash inside the spot just like I told you
Got a nigga bitch taking Roxies like I told you
This my year, ain't even tryna sound cocky, but I told you
Hundred bands out of my pants like I told you, like I told you

[Verse 1]
You know them lil' niggas keep the bullshit on they motherfuckin' mind
Make a nigga drop a dime, pussy nigga know I'll never slip and I'ma pop it every time
Make a nigga pull up to shut up, 12 think he 

[?]
Nigga know I'm bangin' in New York
If I ain't got a stick, he gettin' buck 9
Now you can tell me, it may sound real
Nigga jewelry water, no boat
But his whiskers longer than the seals
Judging by the lie detector test, pussy nigga'll never get a deal
Just got off the phone with Unfoonk
He just been there waitin' on the appeal
You step in my lane, we clashing like titans
She notice them Slimes like them bodies
I pop me three capsules, that's trollies
I'm fuckin' them ranches, no Jolly
Pop me one more capsule, I'm higher than Scotty, no lotty
But you gotta stay silent, girl, they know you been lyin'

[Chorus]
Cut it with the coke then you can go buy a quart
Yo' girl don't wanna leave, she stay upstairs like I'm from New York
Got all of these bitches watchin'

Now I feel like a Mason with a–
Hundred bands of cash inside the spot just like I told you
Got a nigga bitch taking Roxies like I told you (Main bitch)
This my year, ain't even tryna sound cocky, but I told you (No way)
Hundred bands out of my pants like I told you

[Verse 2]
Catch him slippin', take his life at a red light
Throw them bands, this a cash fight
Snitch on each other in a day, this is fed night
Colonial flow, I'm just tryna get my bread right
And I know you lil' niggas ain't gonna do that, homie
Run a hundred bands, it'll get you right (Hey, yeah)
Plain Rollie or the Breitling
Thugger killin' mics, Tyson
Do not play with me, you know what stay with me
She used to charge for 

[?], now she sold it for free
In the 'jects like Future, I know she notice me
No cut 

[?] OG

[Chorus]
Cut it with the coke then you can go buy a quart
Yo' girl don't wanna leave, she stay upstairs like I'm from New York
Got all of these bitches watchin'
All of these niggas watchin'
Beat all my cases in silence
Now I feel like a Mason with a–
Hundred bands of cash inside the spot just like I told you
Got a nigga bitch taking Roxies like I told you

For my theme song (Black)
My leather black jeans on (Black)
Got her bikini on

Tell me your theme song
Tell 'em, I leaned on
I'm gonna do something I lean on
With my bling on and my thing on
Got 'em all watching when I walked in
Tellin' me stop with my black skin
Couldn't do nothing when I walked in
But the black-just like a black tint
Lookin' for somethin' and you got it
You don't know what you got it
'Til it start runnin' and you got it
They got head and they can't win

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Take it you wanna to the corner
Trapped out the corner

Trust me, it's stolen, 'till the morning
And I got it and I'm on it (Ah, ah)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My mama was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes, you woulda thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that "Come in, please buy more"
"What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New slaves

[Bridge: Kanye West]
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves

I can't get too high, can't get too high again
So long, so long, so long
You can't not fall or fly, and I won’t fly again
I can’t lose, I can’t lose
And I don't know but I won't be without you
You can't get too high, get too high again
Haha, too high again, too high, ooh hoo-hoo-hoo, woo
Yeah, h-h-h-high, h-high-high, high-high high-igh-high-high
H-high-igh, yeah, high, high-igh

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
Mhm-igh
She wore faded jeans and soft black leather
She had eyes so blue they looked like weather
When she needed me I wasn't around
That's the way it goes, it'll all work out

There were times apart and times together
I was pledged to her for worse or better
When it mattered most I let her down
That's the way it goes, it'll all work out

It'll all work out eventually
Better off with him than here with me

Now the wind is high and the rain is heavy
The water's rising in the levee
Still I think of her when the sun goes down
Never goes away, but it all works out
Never goes away, but it all works out

[Intro: Kodak Black & Gucci Mane]
Big boy diamonds (Burr)

Baguette Chopard, it's factory setted (Bling)
Run up on Wop and you'll never forget it

I want the cash, I don't want the credit
Went in my stash and gave me a budget
My pockets so budgy that bitches is callin' me handsome
That then, was callin' me ugly (Huh?)
I caught a rash from countin' the money
I'm changin' the climate like global warming (Bling)
She seen the charm and said I'm charming
The watch on my arm, it come with an army

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
Big boy diamonds
Ice on me changin' the climate

Sleepin' on the racks last night, I done fucked around and woke up with a crick in my neck
Got so lit last night, woke up with a buttnaked bitch in my jet
Iced out baguettes on my chest
Bouldercrest tatted in ink on my flesh
I'm the boss, it's a brick on my desk
Brain so good, yeah, she cheat on her test
Got so high one night, woke up with an ice cream cone on my cheek (How?)
Last night dripped so hard courtside, had to call the mop boy to my seat (Wow)
At the Super Bowl in my suite (Yeah)
Ballin' so hard, need cleats (Ballin')
Human highlight like 'Nique ('Nique)
And my diamonds are so unique (Bling)
Heard the alphabet boys still watchin' me
All this D&G on me and my freak (Dolce)
Versace fork and plate when I eat and sleep
And I don't like to talk, talk cheap (Cheap)

Pulled up to the yacht three deep (Deep)
Hundred bad bitches like Freaknik
Diamonds dancing on me like yeet (Iceburg)

I'm that same lil' dusty lil' feet
Nigga got rich, now I feel like I'm Pee
Had to sleep on the floor, now it's courtside seat

Come to 1'5, you can get 'em for cheap

[Verse 1]
Is it really true?
Are you really you?
Are your diamonds huge?
You know they different hues
I'm so sick of you (Are you sick of me?)
New color Gucci blue, they match my Gucci shoes
Come get a load from me, I took a load from you
I'm sellin' chickens to niggas I sold verses to
Come get a P from me, I took a key from you
Shout out my lawyer Drew, shout out to Janice too
Please get away from me, don't want no verse from you
I see right through this dude, I got no love for you
Please stay away from me, I got no love for you
New Lamb' is glacier blue, it match your Birkin too

[Chorus]
McLaren glacier blue, it got 'em hurlin' too
I bought a Wraith for boo, now I want something new
It ain't nun else to do, so I keep buying coupes
It ain't no where to park, I think it's time to move

[Verse 2]
LaFlare in the LaF-F-Ferrari, I'm swervin'
You gunnin' 'cause I so much money, I'm splurgin'
Woke up in a new Bugatti, dropped in the punani
Call me Gucci Mane Delantic, bitch or you can call me Money
Red dawn, I'ma bring it out 'cause the sun out
Woah now, put it in it shawty 'cause you're goin' out
Jumpman, jumpin' from the free throw with my tongue out
I feel like Southside, full of cash, know my niggas ballin'
I'm from the eastside, homicide, tons of marijuana
She a parasite, suck it dry, fucked her on the corner
I took the stand, lie, said I was performin' Arizona
You know my brain fried, please, show some mercy oh your Honor
He tryna hot side, I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm a loner
I heard your man died, I wouldn't give a fuck, that boy a goner
They say it's high tide, fucked her on a beach, I got a boner
All my whips mine, house mine, Gucci Mane a owner (It's Gucci)

[Chorus]
McLaren glacier blue, it got 'em hurlin' too
I bought a Wraith for boo, now I want something new
It ain't nun else to do, so I keep buying coupes
It ain't no where to park, I think it's time to move

[Outro]
I think it's time to move
I think it's time to move
I think it's time to move

If you scared, tap out and holla, "red rock" (Red)
I slang Fred Flintstone, I make the bed rock (Rock)
Drippin' wet, Versace sheets, she left a wet spot (Woo)
I told her, "Let me put that lace front in a leg lock" (Well damn)
She got that water balloon, suck it 'til your head pop (Skrrt)
I'm the sugar daddy, Wop, I'm not the step-pop (Pop, pop)
Leavin' out the strip joint, I want some head now (Damn)
Drop the top now and I just put the head out (Wop)

[Chorus]

I'm so impatient, I can't wait to bring that bread out (Woo)
I was dead broke, now I got that bread now (Damn)

Rodeo Drive, Lambo', Gucci sped out (Damn)
I'm in my blue coupe, can't wait to bring the red out (Wop)
I make a call to Jamaica, fly them dreads out (Rasta)
I'm so impatient, I can't wait to bring that bread out

[Verse 2]
Money turn her on, it make her horny (Horny)
Bumblebee booty, my type of hornet (Mwah)
My business is boomin', I'm on a journey (Rackades)
I stumbled through London this early mornin' (London)
Money callin', call RiRi because it's pourin' (Ri)
Four different Rolls Royce umbrellas, man, I'm a tourist (Woo)
I'm so saditty and pretty, could be a florist
Have you looked at me recently? I look gorgeous (Mwah)
With my pretty saditty bitch, but really she innocent (Huh?)
But she the drug dealer, bitch get the pint and the benefits
In the backseat gettin' intimate, new Bentley, I tinted it
Jerk on the dick like a pogo stick, then eat nut like eggs benedict

[Chorus]
I was dead broke, now I got that bread now (Now)
I'm so impatient, I can't wait to bring that bread out (Woo)
I was dead broke, now I got that bread now (Damn)

Y'all been hidin' from the truth, but you gon' listen today (You gon' listen today)
I'm the head coach, so know what position to play (Huh)
Gas bag shawty, yeah, I gotta fly to the Bay
Knock the meat out your rib, I got tape on the K
She a goddess of the trap, angel white like the yay (Angel)
She so motherfuckin' thick, you let her know where you stay (Woo)
Like a cartoon, lil' bitch took a pie to the face
Ice Cube, cold game, it's one hell of a day
She got a real pretty face, you like, "Where is her waist?" (Where?)
Took that bitch to the place and she like, "Where is the safe?" (Huh?)

[Chorus]
Looking in my pockets, it's filled with blue hundreds (Blue)
Don't nothing move me but the goddamn money
Drop a bag, make the room clear, run, run, dear (Run)
The stick long as a broom, it can kill a reindeer (Yeah)
Before you came here we was sellin' 'caine here (Skrrt)
Since Gucci Mane left, it just not the same here (Nah)
Then I make a false step 'cause he yellin', "Help, help" (Help)
Wet him up like Mike Phelps, dead in seatbelt (Belt)

[Verse 2]
Gambling with the trap god, better not welch (Welch)
He brought it on his own self, he caused his own death (Graow)
Tryna make a death threat with a weak rep (Huh?)
Uphill battle, runnin' up some steep steps (Wop)
Ballers on the right (Right), haters on the left (Left)
Money make these bitches can't keep they hands to they self (Well, damn)

East Atlanta Santa and y'all all Santa elves (Ho)
Buckin', used to pull it, nigga, I was just 12 (Huh?)
You still ain't got no straightening, nigga, you just took an L (Sack)
If I do a feature, it's gon' cost like fifty bales (Fifty)
I need an endorsement, I'm the poster boy for scales (Skrrt)
Took a million risks, I took the train, I took the mail
Most you niggas shell, I sell water to a whale (Shell)
Tried to break me in the cell, I'm too strong, I still prevail
Smoke one for Aaliyah, nigga, turn this up a lil' (Wop)

[Chorus]
Looking in my pockets, it's filled with blue hundreds (Blue)
Don't nothing move me but the goddamn money
Drop a bag, make the room clear, run, run, dear (Run)

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Zaytoven
Huh
They should put me on SportsCenter with all this ballin' I be doin' (Gucci)
You can't see Wop on your best day, nigga (Gang)
It's Gucci
Huh

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Trappin' all day on the goddamn skreets
I didn't even have nowhere to goddamn sleep
I remember recordin' in Zay' mama basement
Way, way, way before he ever had a placement (On God)
Dead bodies in the bando, we called it a vacant (Bando)
Smokin', drinkin', sellin' dope but I was on probation (Facts)
Turned into a killer soon as I left my Cecilia (Straight up)
I don't think they feel ya 'til the ghetto try to kill ya' (Oh Lord)
Free my niggas in the system, motherfuck the system
If you a snitch, fuck you and who snitchin' with ya (Fuck ya)
Loan money walk, let the lady take her picture (Mwah)
Not every day the bitch see a million dollar nigga (Well damn)
Hired killers with me now, I can't be a victim (Pow, pow)
Choppa close by all the time, I'm buckin' the system
Diamonds precious, but nothin's more precious than wisdom (Bling)
The fresh is in the buildin', bless the ghetto-children (Bless 'em)
Fronted me to pack, I ain't pound 'em back, I'm buckin'
Been known to buck the system, call the plug and told 'em, "Fuck 'em"
Pockets swole for parole, I feel is an injustice
For me to be broke and strugglin', I can't be out hustlin' (Gucci)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm buckin', I'm buckin', I'm buckin'
I'm buckin', I'm buckin', I'm buckin' the system
I'm buckin' on niggas, I'm buckin' up pistols
I'm takin' up pistols and kill 'em
I'm buckin', I'm buckin', I'm buckin'
I'm buckin', I'm buckin', I'm buckin' the system
Don't fuck with these niggas
Don't rock with these niggas
They try me, I'm buckin' the system

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Breadwinner fly and I'm goin' out gangsta'
Gold mouth dawg and your homeboy fakin'
Breadwinner landlord, need a little favor
Peterbilt, eighteen-wheeler with the reefer trailer
I don't get a load in, I'ma send a load, bitch
Shot the strong arm to the judge up in court, bitch
Ding-dong, push button bricks, front door shit
1017, nigga, Breadwinner, Brick Squad! (Brick Squad!)
I control a forklift, yeah, they just sent four
Hundred round discharge, writin' on the clipboard
Put you in the coffin, I bought a new fit for it
Bite a nigga apple (Baow), MacBook laptop
Droptop, MAC-11, ridin' with the strap out
Got my own blueprint, guess I got it mapped out
Just was on Carolina, standin' in the trap house
Said I wouldn't be shit, think I didn't hear about it
Now a nigga clip cost bigger than your real house
I get on a helicopter blindfold to Mexico
You pull up to meet a middle man at Texaco
Breadwinner safeguard, run off on who?
You gotta send the money 'fore the load come through
Nigga Peewee League, pay with peewee cheese
I be overseas, I'm in Medellín with it
If you takin' my lick, I got felonies, nigga
Livin' like that when I fell in these systems
Real Hermés, what we sell in these trenches
Deal cocaine, but the recipe different
Ask Lee Lucas if I'm cut like that
Real street nigga, but the pedigree different
Pillow talk 'bout me, you a jelly bean nigga
I slam on your fam' if you tell on me nigga
I slam on your fam' if you tell on me nigga

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm buckin', I'm buckin', I'm buckin'
I'm buckin', I'm buckin', I'm buckin' the system
I'm buckin' on niggas, I'm buckin' up pistols
I'm takin' up pistols and kill 'em
I'm buckin', I'm buckin', I'm buckin'
I'm buckin', I'm buckin', I'm buckin' the system
Don't fuck with these niggas
Don't rock with these niggas
They try me, I'm buckin' the system

You see this shit that Cain did, and they weren't even strangers (Damn)
My daddy dead, my momma dead (Mom), so God sent me some angels (Pa)

Cocaína off the airplane (Guc'), own private hanger
The chopper in the trunk make you do the Macarena (True)
Money in container, shippin' it to Califina (Woo)
Running circles 'round these squares with these rectangles (Skrrt)
Mountain Park apartments next to Triangle (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, true)
Heard they fucked him with a broom stick and left it in his anal
If you dwell on it, think too long, you go insane-ah (Whoa, damn)
Dash your own heroin, they searchin' for a vein-oh (Yeah)
Dope so good, it clog the pipe line, need Drano (Hoo)
Had to bring the chopsticks and cut that boy up like Maino (Cha-cha)
Twin extended .40, yeah, that's bangers on bangers (Twin)
Niggas sayin' that they trappin', but they R&B singers (Hm)

[Chorus]
Homicide with malice, a lot of niggas jealous (Yeah)
I wrote the streets a ballad, I woke up on a pallet (Mm)
Gucci my suspenders, I used to get suspended (Guwop)
Stay far away from snitches, I highly recommend it (Racks)

[Intro: Mary J. Blige]
You see, I'm searching for a real love and I don’t know where to go
I been around the world and high and low and still I never know
How it feels to have a real love 'cause it seems there's none around
I gotta end it in this way because it seems he can’t be—

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
We are lovers through and through
And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize, I really want to put you on
I've been searching for someone to satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration?
Be the real love that I need

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Real love
I'm searching for a real love (Oh-oh)
Someone to set my heart free (Oh-oh)
Real love (Oh-oh)
I'm searching for a real love

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Ooh, when I met you
I just knew that you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you loved for me, you said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Real love, yeah
I'm searching for a real love (Oh-oh)
Someone to set my heart free (Oh-oh)
Real love
I'm searching for a real love
I got to have a real love

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
Love so true, and oh baby
I thought that love was true (Thought your love was true)
I thought that you were the answer to the question in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong (Wrong)
If I stay strong (Strong), maybe I’ll find a—

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Look up in the sky, it’s a bird, it's a plane
Nope, it’s Mary J., ain't a damn thing changed
Kickin' ill flava with the Teflon Don
Wreckin' shop, gettin’ props, she got it goin' on
So what's it gonna be? The real one, the fake one?
Ya need a minute to think? Well, hoes, ya better take one
Welp, my time is up, peace out to Brooklyn
Puff and Daddy-O, ayo, bring the verse in

[Verse 4: Mary J. Blige]
So I've tried my best and prayed to God he'll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me towards a love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful, I can be your all and all
I'll give you good lovin' through the summertime, winter, spring and fall

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Real love
I'm searching for a real love (Real love, real love)
Someone to set my heart free
Real, real love
I'm searching for a real love
Mmm

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
You see, I'm searching for a real love and I don't know where to go (Ooh)

Reminisce on the love we had
You and I, you and I
Reminisce on the love we had
Yeah
You know, you know we had it all
You and I, yeah

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Let's make the time tonight

The candle light and you
Walking softly through my door
Come on in, my sweet
How have you been?
You're so nice
But tonight, we're gonna be more than just friends

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I recall the days and ways of love we made
I still feel the heat when we share each other
Don't you feel the magic? The mystery's in the air
Let's go down to lover's lane (With the love we shared)
With the love we shared

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Let's make the time tonight
Reminisce oh so right
Reminisce on the love we had
Make the time tonight

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
I can see you standing there alone
Like an angel trying to find his way home
I don't remember, how we fell apart
Here we are again, come on, fly into my heart

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I recall the days and ways of love we made
I still feel the heat when we share each other
Don't you feel the magic? The mystery's in the air
Let's go down to lover's lane (With the love we shared)
With the love we shared

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Let's make the time tonight

Make the time tonight

[Verse 3: Milk Dee]
Boom! M to the I to the L to the K
MC M-I is the shit I used to say
And when I reminisce, I reminisce about a song that was hittin'
And all the skins I was gettin'
But now I'll do a stunt, but I won't do a stunt
Girls in the back try to flake but they can't front
It's the Milk and the Giz that they're missin'
We get the cuties reminiscin', listen

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Let's make the time tonight
Reminisce oh so right
Reminisce on the love we had
Make the time tonight
Let's make the time tonight
Reminisce oh so right
Reminisce on the love we had
Make the time tonight

[Outro: Mary J. Blige]
Ooh, baby

Walking softly through my door
Let’s make the time tonight
While the feeling's right
Come on in, my sweet
Reminisce on the love we had
Tonight we're gonna be more than just friends
Let’s make the time tonight

Reminisce on the love we had
Ooh boy

Ooh baby, reminisce
While the feeling's right
Reminisce
Reminisce on the love we had
On the love we had

[Intro]
Yo Puff, I don’t think they ready for this one

Baby, there's no need to tell you
As far as I can clearly recall
My love has been here for you

Good love (Good love, good love) down to the last drop
And I'm not gonna stop

[Chorus]
Said I’m loving you, loving you every day

You know, you know
Said I’m loving you
You don’t have to worry
Loving you every day
’Cause I’m loving you, boy
Don't you look no more, love without a limit
Said I’m love, said I’m loving
Said I’m loving you, loving you every day
Said I’m loving you, boy
Don't you look no more, love without a limit
Yeah
Said I’m loving you, loving you every day
Don't you look no more, love without a limit
You know, you know

[Bridge]
Said I’m loving you, loving you every day
Loving you is all I wanna do

[Verse 1]
How can I love somebody else
If I can't love myself enough
To know when it's time, time to let go?
Oh-whoa
Sing

[Chorus]
All I really want (Yeah)
Is to be happy (Oh yeah)
And to find a love that's mine (Ooh)
It would be so sweet (Hey)
All I really want (Oh)
Is to be happy (I wanna be happy, yeah)
And to find a love that's mine (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It would be so sweet

[Verse 2]
I asked for a sign from my sweet Lord above
I know the answer is in front of me
But when you think you're in love
You only see what you wanna see
And all I see is me for you and you for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I cannot hide the way I feel inside
(No, I don't know why)
I don't know why but every day I wanna cry
(Every day I wanna cry)
But if I give you one more try
To these rules, will you abide?
And if I mean anything to you
Would it make everything all right? (Ooh)

[Chorus]
All I really want
Is to be happy (Ooh)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet (I said I wanna be happy)
All I really want
Is to be happy (Oh, I wanna be)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet (To find a love that's mine)
All I really want (Oh, it'll be so fine)
Is to be happy (Wanna be happy)
And to find a love that's mine (Yeah)
It would be so sweet (It would be so sweet)
All I really want (If only we could be)
Is to be happy (We can be happy)
And to find a love that's mine (I wanna be happy)
It would be so sweet

[Bridge]
I just wanna be so, so, happy
But the answer lies in me
I do believe that we can be happy
I said I wanna be happy, yeah, yeah
Yeah, now let it breathe

[Verse 3]
Life is too short to be tryin' to play some games
Now take some time and think about
If it's really worth losing me
Why must it be this way?
Why do you have to play with my mind all the time?
Help me sing it

[Pre-Chorus]
All I really want is for me to be happy
(Oh, just help me sing it)
All I really want is for me to be happy
(Yeah, yeah yeah)
All I really want is for me to be happy
(Oh, you know I wanna be happy)
All I really want is for me to be happy (Yeah, yeah)

And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

All I really want (It'll be all right with me)
Is to be happy

Dear April
The only face in the crowd that I knew
Dear April
Are you watching this?
Are you watching him dance?
Dear April
We were safe for a while
We were safe as the years flew by

If you could take two strangers
Leaning left and right
At a certain place and time
Like you took these strangers
And our two strange lives
And made us new
And took us through
And woke us up
I believe that no matter what
It can make us new
Take us through it
And wake us up again
What we had won't be the same now
But you will make something new
And it'll take you through this
If you can take two strangers
Leaning left and right
At a certain place and time
Like you took these strangers
And our two strange lives
And made us new
And took us through
And woke us up
I believe no matter what
Take us through it
And wake us up again
And what we had can't be the same now
But you will make something
And it'll take you through
It'll wake you up again

Just like you made me new (You made me new)
Just like you took me through (Took me through)
Just like you woke me up (Woke me up, yeah)
You made me new
You took me through
You woke me up (Woke me up)

Dear April
Are you watching him dance?

Let’s just get that out of the way.

Club culture around late 70s and 80s nightlife in NYC was a special, much talked about and written about thing. From the star studded midtown clubs like studio 54 and the first danceteria to the downtown clubs like Mudd + paradise garage. The figures, the music, the looks, the lack of regulation haha. I recognize NY wasn’t all lasers and disco lighting and that simultaneously, there was a lot of crime and poverty and that a huge part of club culture, the gay community, at that time were being wiped out by HIV + AIDS. Now in 2019, there’s a pill you can take every day that will at a better than 90% chance prevent you from contracting HIV. This pill was approved by the FDA in 2012. The pricing strategy behind it is malicious in my opinion and so it’s public perception is marred and rightfully so. But the fact remains that despite price being a very real barrier to this potentially life saving drug for some, the other very real barrier is awareness. I decided to name, what was otherwise going to be a night of lights and music inspired by an era of clubbing that I loved PrEP+ because while designing the club which is inside of an old glass factory basement in Queens (shoutout to The Basement that runs a very awesome techno night on Fridays after us) I started to imagine in an era where so many lives were lost and so much promise was lost forever along with them, what would it have been like if something, anything had existed that in all probability would’ve saved thousands and thousands of lives. I’m an artist, it’s core to my job to imagine realities that don’t necessarily exist and it’s a joy to. A couple days before we threw the party, I was discussing this subject with my team and one of the architects I work with thought that PrEP as a drug had reached ‘100% saturation’ so far as awareness. I thought he was dead wrong so I asked a friend (who I won’t name haha) if he knew what PrEP was and his response was ‘isn’t that some type of viagra or something’. My ex who I was with for several years didn’t know about it when we first met at a gay club in LA. Awareness isn’t always what we’d hope it would be. But anyway, I’m ranting. I’m happy that folks are talking about the subject in the first place. Thank you to everyone who came out and danced with us last night. Y’all were beautiful and the energy was right! Thank you Bouffant Bouffant, Sango, Justice and Sherelle for your sets last night they were soo good man. Oh one more thing, I saw someone say that this was a PR stunt etc etc, pshhh bitch pls come get a drink next time and I’ll put several barstools out so you can have as many seats as you need. All my love everybody really. Stay safe.

[Verse]
Uh, I ain't no killer, but don't push me
I look a sucker in his eyes and tell you if he pussy
Remember runnin' times, the people would overlook me
The bitches would try to play me
My future was lookin' shady
Wanted to be a star
They locked me behind bars
Tried to shred up my dream
I tell you them times hard
I ain't never give up, I hustled, I grind hard
Put my faith into God, I know I'ma shine hard
I had no choice, but the wind, but the odds was against me
So, I'm rollin' through this bitch with my palms on the ceme'
My dad died when I was young
So, my mom would defend me
My sister would protect me
Now, the main niggas respect me
Had to learn to be a man
Learn to hold my hands
Learn to work that skill
Turn 'em ounces into grams
Learn to work that tool
Stack this money and feed the fam
Now, I'm the best thing since Africa went fell into the land

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, when you look at me
I get a warm feeling inside
Sugar sugar, won't you rescue me
Come take me for a ride
I ain’t gon' lie to you, baby
It's mainly a physical thing
This feeling that I got for you, baby
It makes me feel this 

[?], yeah

[Chorus]
I feel for you, I think I love you
I feel for you, I think I love you

[Verse 2]
Baby, baby, when I lay wit’ you
There's no place I'd rather be
I can't believe, can't believe it's true
The things that you do to me
I ain't gon' lie to you, baby
It’s mainly a physical thing
This feeling that I got for you, baby
It makes me feel 

[?]

[Chorus]
I feel for you, I think I love you
I feel for you, I think I love you

And I’m smellin’ like a new box of Benjamins
Black card in the gucci wallet, holla
And I charge so much, it’s a penalty
And I travel so much, it’s a penalty
Ladies and gentlemen, what you gon’ do?
The gun fit in the Timberland, the Timberland boot
I’m so invisible, invisible to you
‘Cause you can’t see me and you’re see through
Young Money baby, what’s up with y’all?

[Verse 2]
We know the cops don’t like us
Because they wanna rock just like us
But even if we knew you since diapers, if you’re a cop now, you are not just like us
I’ma ridah baby, I wouldn’t lie to ya
I probably live for ya, but I wouldn’t die for ya
And I’m high to the point of too high, if a nigga come down, it’ll be a suicide
And the difference between you and I
I’ma get ahead, you gon’ get behind -
Me, and watch me do my thing
And everyday give all thanks to my king
As true as I seem is how real I am
And if ya feel is fake then here I am
That boy ain’t in my plan
But Baby that boy ya man

So tell the haters I say that I’m doing just fine

[Verse 3]
And you know I’ma stunt, I gotta stunt
But if I pop the trunk, you may think I hunt
That’s why, the federales all over my Cavalli’s
Bad enough I got a bunch of women tryna find me
What am I to do, but hop in a Ferrari?
Pop up at the party like, “Drinks for everybody!”
Yeah, Thank you everybody
Those of you who respect what Wayne do
Shit, better believe this star is spangled
That mean I got stripes like fuck what fame do
Yeah, baby girl, fuck what ya man do
I can take care of you, the kids and ya man too
I ran through my city like a chicken with his head off, but everything paid off
Every link iced up, everybody’s ready
Take a picture and hold the camera steady
Look at me

[Hook]
Yeah, and you can do what you wanna do, ‘cause I do me
And I do it real well, and yes I -
I’ma get by and I’m a get mine
So tell the haters I say that I’m doing just fine
And you can do what you wanna do, ‘cause I do me
And I do it real well, and yes I -

So tell the haters I say that I’m doing just fine

It makes you burn to learn you're not the only one (Oh)
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (Right behind you)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before (Oh)
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

[Post-Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
This is the remix
Everybody to the dance floor right now
Showtime!

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Sometimes you move so well, it's hard not to give in
I'm lost, I can't tell where you end and I begin
It makes me burn to learn you're with another man
I wonder if he's half the lover that I am

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (Right behind you)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
Baby, baby, please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind (Promise not to leave me behind)
Take me down, but take it easy
Make me think but don't deceive me
Torture me by taking your time (Talk to me)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

[Post-Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
In the visuals, Maroon 5, swizzy beats

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]

Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow, I want more

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Verse 2]
Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
Doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come any time you want, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Bridge]
I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and makes me catch her every time she falls, yeah
Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh

[Intro]
Na, na na, na na, na na

[Verse 1]
I wish you looked at me the way you look at Mary Jane
The way you let her kiss you and the way you say her name
You like to call me crazy like I don’t know that I’m insane
But you used to look at me the way you look at Mary Jane

(Na) Look at me, look at me (Na, na)
Look at me, look at me (Na, na)
Look at me, look at me (Na, na)
Look at me

[Verse 2]
I wish you looked at me the way you look at Mary Jane
Knowing that you’re losing me, I wonder what you gain
My heart was in your hands, but now you got hold of my brain
I wish you looked at me the way you look at

[Chorus 1]
Oh, I wanna be that one, I wanna be that song
The one that you can play on repeat all night long
And, oh, we used to have that something
But we know that something’s gone
We know that something’s gone

[Post-Chorus]
Na, na na na na na, na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na, na na na na na, na na na na na, na na na na na

[Bridge]
Oh, having to pretend is getting exhausting
Acting like I'm livin' when you know I'm dead
And oh, was it something that I said?
Or something that I did?
To make you choose her instead

[Verse 3]
You used to look at me the way you look at Mary Jane
Knowing that you’re losing me, I wonder what you gain
You like to call me crazy like I don’t know that I’m insane
But you used to look at me, ahh ahh, the way you look at

[Chorus 2]
Oh, I used to turn you on, I used to be that song
The one that you would play on repeat all night long
And oh, we used to have that something
But we know that something’s gone
We know that something’s gone

[Post-Chorus]
Na, na na na na na, na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na
Na, na na na na na na, na na na na na, na na na na na

[Outro]
(Na) Look at me, look at me (Na, na)
Look at me, look at me (Na, na)
Look at me, look at me (Na, na)
Look at me
Na, na na, na na, na na

[Verse 1]
I woke up in Montecito
I was thinkin' about my life
And the questions made more questions
Starin' out into the night
Yes, I've worn the golden G-string
Put my hand into hellfire
I did it all to make you love me and to feel alive

[Chorus]
Oh, that's just the world that we're livin' in
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playin' gin
You dare to call me crazy, have you looked around this place?
I should walk away
Oh, I should walk away
But I think I'll stay

[Verse 2]
There are layers to this body
Primal sex and primal shame
They told me I should cover it
So I went the other way
I was tryin' to own my power
Still I'm tryin' to work it out
And at least it gives the paper somethin' they can write about

[Chorus]
And oh, that's just the world that we're livin' in
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playin' gin
And you dare to call me crazy, have you looked around this place?
I should walk away
Oh, I should walk away
But I think I'll stay

[Bridge]
So the mad man's in the big chair
And his heart's an iron vault
He says "If you can't make ends meet, honey, it must be your fault"
We all focus on the winners
And get blinded by their shine
Maybe caring for each other's just too 1969

[Chorus]
But oh, that's just the world that we're livin' in
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playin' gin
And you dare to call me crazy, have you looked around this place?
I should walk away
Oh, I should walk away
But I think I'll stay

[Outro]
And I think I'll stay, yeah
I have too much to lose
So I think I'll stay
I can't walk away

[Chorus: 2D]
Snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders

[Verse 1: Roots Manuva]
Rolling the die
Looking for my lady
In the clutch and the one called lady luck
If infected me
My world view ever stop wretchedly
Ain't nothing bigger than the lesson of life itself
I scratch, the yourself
Far screwed, far step
Whose to blame?
Who put the chemicals in the food chain?
Take a whiff of my mutant breath
10 pounds of squeeze on my silicone breath
Piping dream called dream
Alcohol and kick a hole in on the T.V. screen

[Chorus: 2D]
Snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders (x2)

[Outro: 2D]
Not above a hair, I run
Big people never come

[Verse 1]
You only love me in bits and pieces
I keep on working, you keep your secrets
That's not an insult, that's not a lie
That's just a statement proven by time

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause even when I have you, I don't really have you
I am not your last dude, where'd you get this attitude?
Talkin' 'bout you're leavin' cause you don't believe in
Me and all my reasons, left me with these demons
And this little pen, and this nostalgic feeling
Won't leave me alone
I'm faking all my smiles

[Chorus]
And you're just killing me with silence
And you're just killing me with time
I don't know where to put my sorrys
You're running laps around my mind
How could you leave me on this tightrope?
And I feel nothing when it storms
You know you're killing me with silence
You hold your halo up with horns
You hold your halo up with horns

[Verse 2]
You know you're clever, I'll give you that
You gave me heaven then took it back
That's not an insult, that's just the case
You've had that damn mask on for so damn long that everybody thinks it's your face

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But back beneath my eyelids I can hear the silence
Spreading like a virus while you wear disguises
Why you have to cut me then act like it's nothing?
This time I'm not bluffing, how you know I'm bluffing
Every single time
Your wicked little mind
It gets inside my head
And I can fake a smile

[Chorus]
But you're just killing me with silence
But you're just killing me with time
I don't know where to put my sorrys
You're running laps around my mind
How could you leave me on this tightrope?
And I feel nothing when it storms
You know you're killing me with silence
You hold your halo up with horns
You hold your halo up with horns

[Post-Chorus]
Ho-o-o-rns
(You)
Ho-o-o-rns
(Oh Lord)
Ho-o-o-rns
(Whooo-oh-oh)
Ho-o-o-rns
You hold your halo up with horns
Ho-o-o-orns
Ho-o-o-rns
(Oh no, no, no)
Ho-o-o-orns
You hold your, you hold your, you hold your
Ho-o-o-orns
You hold your, you hold your, you hold your
Ho-o-o-orns
And you're just killing me with silence

[Verse 1: Wayne Hector]
Woo
I've been fighting too many wars
Lady Luck please take me, I'm yours
I've been losing, who's keeping score?
'Cause I know we've all been here before, yeah
Give me good times 'fore they're all gone
Love me, fool me, don't leave me alone
All this time I've been rolling my stone
And I still haven't found my way home
But I know I'll be free, yeah, I know I'll be me again

[Verse 2: Sarah Blackwood]
Now the tides will carry you away from me
But they can't last forever
All the time that I been feeling lost at sea
I still haven't found my way home
But you're a star that I will follow where you lead
'Cause we belong together
When the tides take me back where I used to be
But I know I'll be free and I know I'll be me again

[Chorus: Wayne Hector]
Free again
I keep this fire burning my soul
Leave it running out of control
'Til you're broken you don't know when you're whole
Still tryna find my way home
But I know I'll be free, yeah, I know I'll be me again

[Post-Chorus: Wayne Hector & Sarah Blackwood]
And now the tides will carry you away from me
But they can't last forever
All the time that I've been feeling lost at sea
I still haven't found my way home
But you're a star that I will follow where you lead
'Cause we belong together
When the tides take me back where I used to be
But I know I'll be free and I know I'll be me again

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
So they looking for me
They don't know

Right here, I'ma sit by the window
See they gonna have to get me
Yeah, they gonna have to get me
Come get me

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Damn shame, why they let me get a champagne, uh
The young can produce thunder, I make black rain, uh
Blood stain saw all over his black range, uh
Catch him at the lights to turn off his lights mane
Life been treating me right so I can't complain, uh
Career 'bout to take flight, G4 plane (Yep)
I stunt niggas growth in this rap shit
Suggest you react quick or invest in some globe games
I'm propane and hard liquor, bow down to who
What nigga, toss bullets like flea flickers
To the fullest, I'ma get it to the core
And they tape pictures, yellow tape, stretched out, inches
I can't wait like the first day of school
Waking up, three in the morning, looking at my shoes
But this time around, I be looking are my tool
Wiping it down, 

[?] every other commercial now
Hold my mom, it's nothing to hurt you
Two straps on my side, I'm looking like 

[?], blaw
Did I do that, yes I did
I told you the truth, cause no witnesses, I'm the truth
Still, I remain calm like a soldier in war
Surrounded by, three bombs, cautious
Shots keep coming like I got three arms
Two trigger fingers over one bomb, let it breathe

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
Hm, I'm surprise
Ya'll not here yet
Plans must have change
But I'm still here
I even let the backdoor open
Come on now

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Kill 'em, kill 'em, send 'em to the morgue
Let 'em fill him with a brimming fluid
We ain't sorry for nothing
We ain't tryna play hardcore nothing
But you overdid it when you push the button
So we caught the USSR, push the button on it
Let it blew up a few cars
You really don't want it 

[?] and your homie don't want it neither
Shoe string, choke 'em up, let 'em get no breather
No pressure, black and white, the skies
Looking like uncle Fester, poppin' up on you guys
The .22 fit right between my bitch thighs
If you blink once, it be pointing right between your eyes
You better off tryna plan your own suicide
Cause it's nothing, but torture if you want you to die
The 745 got weed in it, riding with the .45, times two the speed limit
I pop eyes for a 

[?] that spinach
Cut 'em down to the white meat, have 'em no skinnin'
I'm not finish until my niggas ate too
So any given time they can grace you
What you want? Casket, await due
My pain in a box is quite more you
So they can see the damage done at the wake view
Hide 'em hollow tips, hopscotch on the face you breathe

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
So ya'll still ain't here
So I guess there's a first time for everything if ya'll don't come
But I'm still here
In fact I'm still waiting for someone else
Punch

[Verse 3: Punch]
Yeah, I got the range of a 

[?]
From nine hundred yards by the grass I been walkin'
See, so don't think I don't see you dudes creepin'
Reaching for my spot, then spot a niggas breathin'
A grown man, ya'll cats barely 

[?]
Lil dudes tryna catch me like they wide receiving
Stop it, 

[?], custom drop it
That's one point two, minus the roof, don't stop rams
I'm in the cockpit, windows up, black tint
I'm not from 'round here, it's like I breathe with an accent
Whether you has been, future or present
I remove you from your flesh, teach you dudes a lesson
'Cuse the digression, abuse studio sessions
I'ma fool on the 

[?], the dude, no question
Uncomfortable homie, barefoot in the booth
Stop and breathe for a second, inhale the truth
Breathe niggas

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]

It's so erotic
This feeling can't be beat
It's coursing through my whole body, feel the heat

[Pre-Chorus]
I got that burnin' hot desire
And no one can put out my fire
It's coming right down through the wire
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums
It's got me singing

[Chorus]
(Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey)
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like, (Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey)
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
Girls, they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin' gun
On the floor, 'til the daylight comes
Girls, they just wanna have some fun

[Interlude]
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild

[Verse 2]
The room is spinning
It must be the Tanqueray
I'm about to go astray
My inhibition's gone away
I feel like sinning
You got me in the zone
DJ play my favorite song
Turn me on

[Pre-Chorus]
I got that burnin' hot desire
And no one can put out my fire
It's coming right down through the wire
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums
It's got me singing

[Chorus]
(Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey)
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like, (Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey)
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
Girls, they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin' gun
On the floor, 'til the daylight comes
Girls, they just wanna have some fun

[Bridge]
I know, I know, I know I shouldn't act this way
I know, I know, I know good girls don't misbehave
Misbehave
But I'm a bad girl anyway
Forgive me

[Breakdown]
A material
A material
A material

[Chorus]
(Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey)
(Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey)
Girls, they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin' gun
On the floor, 'til the daylight comes
Girls, they just wanna have some fun

[Outro]
I'm like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild

[Intro: Madonna]
Don't fuck with the Queen...

What's up, Miami? (My love's a revolver, revolver, revolver)
Are you ready (My love's a revolver, revolver, revolver)
For by badass bitches tonight?

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Oops, I guess I'll shot ya
My finger's on the trigger
I had a bullet with your name on it
Click-click
I'm a sex pistol
My love should be illegal
Real deal, baby
I'm no counterfeit
Click-click

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
If looks could kill
Ay-oh-ee-oh
My body's fully loaded
And I've got more ammo
Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
If looks could kill
Ay-oh-ee-oh
You're an accessory to murder, 'cause

[Chorus: Madonna]
My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?
I let it bang bang

[Verse 2: Madonna]
You've been hit by a smooth criminal
A bad girl, I gotcha crying to your mumma
Saying "I can't believe it" (I can't believe it)
I've seen your type, bring a knife into a gun fight
Caught up in the law right
I think I'm in love and I

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
If looks could kill
Ay-oh-ee-oh
My body's fully loaded
And I've got more ammo
Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
If looks could kill
Ay-oh-ee-oh
You're an accessory to murder, 'cause

[Chorus: Madonna]
My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?
I let it bang bang

[Post-Chorus: Madonna]
I let it bang bang
I shoot 'em bang bang
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
I shoot 'em bang bang
I shoot 'em bang bang
I line 'em up and watch them fall

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Bang
Tha shooting name is Wayne
The victim didn't complain, she just screamed "shoot again"
I gave her extra rounds, my barrel twist around
I am Mr. shoot 'em down, I leave hearts on tha ground
My love is a weapon, and yes I use it well
Then I let the rose petals cover up the bullet shells
I never shoot and tell, I only shoot to kill
And the vest ain't gonna help it even if it's made of steel

[Chorus: Madonna]
My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?
My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?

[Post-Chorus: Madonna]
I let it bang bang
I shoot 'em bang bang
I line 'em up and watch them fall
I shoot 'em bang bang
I shoot 'em bang bang
I line 'em up and watch them fall

[Verse 1]
Like a bitch out of order
Like a bat out of hell
Like a fish out of water
I'm scared, can't you tell?
Bang bang - bang bang
I thought you were good, but you painted me bad
Compared to the others, you're the best thing I had
Bang bang - shot you dead
Bang bang - shot you dead

[Verse 2]
I thought it was you, and I loved you the most
But I was just keeping my enemies close
Made a decision, I will never look back
So, how did you end up with all of my jack?
Bang bang - shot you dead
Bang bang - shot you dead (In the head)

[Verse 3]
Bitch out of order
Bat out of hell
Fish out of water
I'm scared, can't you tell?
Bang bang - shot you dead
Bang bang - shot you dead

[Chorus]
Bang bang - shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Bang bang - shot you dead and I have no regrets
Bang bang - shot you dead (In the head)
Bang bang - shot you dead, shot my lover in the head

[Verse 4]
And then I discovered it couldn't get worse
You were building my coffin, you were driving my hearse
Bang bang - shot you dead
Bang bang - in the head
I thought it was you, and I loved you the most
But I was just keeping my enemies close
I made a decision, I would never look back
So, how did you end up with all of my jack?
Bang bang - shot you dead, in the head

[Chorus]
Bang bang - shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Bang bang - shot you dead and I have no regrets
Bang bang - shot you dead (In the head)
Bang bang - shot you dead, shot my lover in the head

[Interlude]
(Haha)
I need you to die for me, baby

[Breakdown]
You have to die for me, baby
Bang bang - shot you dead
Bang bang - shot you dead
Bang bang - shot you dead
I need you to die for me, baby!

[Chorus - Variation]
Bang bang - shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Bang bang - shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Bang bang - shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Now my lover is dead and I have no regrets (He deserved it)

[Bridge]
And now I'm going straight to hell
And I got a lot of friends there
And if I see this bitch in hell
I'm gonna shoot him in the head again
'Cause I wanna see him die
Over, and over, and over, and over
And over, and over, and over, and over
Now drive, bitch!
Don't fuck it up
I said drive, bitch!
And while you're at it, die, bitch!
That's right, drive, bitch
Motherfucker
Now drive, bitch! I said drive, bitch!
And while you're at it, die bitch!
That's right, drive bitch!

[Outro]
Now if you're gonna act like a bitch
Then you're gonna die like a bitch

Time goes by so slowly

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly

[Chorus]
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up

[Verse 1]
Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up, I don't know what to do

[Pre-Chorus]
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
I don't know what to do

[Chorus]
Every little thing that you say or do

Waiting for your call, baby, night and day

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day

[Verse 2]
Ring, ring, ring goes the telephone
The lights are on, but there's no one home
Tick tick tock, it's a quarter to two
And I'm done, I'm hanging up on you

[Interlude]
Oh my God
Oh my God
Oh my God
I am heartily sorry for
Having offended Thee
Forgive me

[Breakdown]
You'll be sorry
(Time goes by so slowly)
(Time goes by so slowly)
(Time goes by so slowly)
(Time goes by so slowly)
Please forgive me
(So slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly so slowly)
I don't know what to do

Every little thing that you say or do

Every little thing, every little thing
I'm hung up
Waiting for your call, waiting for your call

[Intro: Kalakan Trio]
I don't give a fuck fuck fuck fuck
I don't give a fuck fuck fuck
I don't give a fuck fuck fuck fuck
I don't give a fuck fuck fuck
I don't give a fuck fuck fuck fuck
I don't give a fuck fuck fuck

I don't give a fuck fuck fuck fuck
I don't give a fuck fuck fuck fuck

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Wake up, ex-wife
This is your life
Children, on your own
Turning on the telephone
Messages, manager
No time for a manicure
Working out, shake my ass
I know how to multitask
Connecting to the Wi-Fi
Went from nerd to superb
Have you seen the new guy?
I forgot the password
Gotta call the babysitter
Tweeting on the elevator
I could take a helicopter
I don't even feel the pressure

[Chorus: Madonna]
I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track?
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem, I don't give a...

[Verse 2: Madonna]
You were so mad at me
Who's got custody?
Lawyers, suck it up
Didn't have a pre-nup
Make a film, write a song
Gotta get my stockings on
Meet the press, buy the dress
All of this to impress
RIde my horse, break some bones
Take it down a semitone
I forgot to say my prayers
Baby Jesus on the stairs
Gotta sign a contract
Gotta get my money back
All the bottles have to go
Standing in the front row

[Chorus: Madonna]
I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track?
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem, I don't give a...

[Bridge: Madonna]
I tried to be a good girl
I tried to be your wife
Diminished myself and swallowed my light
I tried to become all that you expect of me
And if it was a failure, I don't give a

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj, Madonna]
Shots fire!
Anything you hear Nicki on, that's fire!
You don't hear them bums on nothing, that's fire!
Tell 'em, "catch fire"
In the Bugatti, ten grand, one tire
Ayo Madonna (Yes, Nicki?)
Mi yuh say you original, Don Dada
Inna ya Gabbana, inna all ya Prada!
We material girls, ain't nobody hotter
Pops collar!
See, I really can't relate to your Volvo
And you can't get these shoes at the Aldo
When I let a dude go, that's his loss
I was cutting them checks, I was his boss!
Yo, I don't give a F you, curse nor bless you
Never let 'em stress you, yo
I ain't a businesswoman, I'm a business, woman!
And I'm known for giving bitches the business, woman

[Chorus: Madonna, Nicki Minaj]
I'm gonna be okay (Mama)
I don't care what the people say (Madonna!)
I'm gonna be alright (Nicki Minaj!)
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track? (Let's go)
I'm moving fast and I like it like that (Catch up)
I do ten things all at once (Mama)
And if you have a problem, I don't give a

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
There's only one queen and that's Madonna
Bitch!

[Chorus]
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
My heartbeat, my heartbeat, my heartbeat
My heartbeat, my heartbeat, my heartbeat
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
My heartbeat, my heartbeat, my heartbeat
My heartbeat, my heartbeat, my heartbeat

[Verse 1]
I miss your brain, the way you think
(Think, think, think, think, think, think)
But I don't miss the way you used to drink
(Drink, drink, drink, drink)
U-u-u, u-u-u, u-u-u, universal law
Seeing through my flaws
(Flaws, flaws, flaws)

[Pre-Chorus]
Your picture's off my wall
But I'm still waiting for your call
And every man that walks through that door
Will be compared to you

[Chorus]
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
My heartbeat, my heartbeat, my heartbeat
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
My heartbeat, my heartbeat, my heartbeat
My heartbeat, my heartbeat, my heartbeat

[Verse 2]
I miss the countryside where we used to lay
(Lay, lay)
The smell of roses on a lovely, lo-lovey su-summer day
(Day, day, day, day)
Maybe I challenged you a little bit too much
(Challen-, challen-, challen-, challeng-g-g, challen-, intellectual)
We couldn't have two drivers on the clutch

[Pre-Chorus]
Your picture's off my wall
But I'm still waiting for your call
And every man that walks through that door
Will be compared to you

[Chorus]
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
My heartbeat, my heartbeat, my heartbeat
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
My heartbeat
Feel like I lost my very best friend
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
My heartbeat, my heartbeat, my heartbeat
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
My heartbeat
Feel like I lost my very best friend

[Outro]
It's so sad that it had to end

[Spoken Intro]
Come on, girls
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes a little something like this

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And, baby, then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 1]
You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And, baby, then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 2]
Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, better make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

[Interlude]
One, two, three, four!
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself, and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

Express yourself
So you can respect yourself, hey hey
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

[Outro]
Express yourself (Express yourself)
Respect yourself (Respect yourself)
Express yourself (Express yourself)
Respect yourself (Respect yourself)
She's not me
She's not me
She's not me
She's not me

I see you coming and you’re gonna have to change the game

Would you like to try? Give me a reason why
Give me all that you got
Maybe you’ll do fine as long as you don’t lie to me
(Give-me all your love)

[Breakdown: M.I.A., Nicki]
I'm bionic, I'm supersonic
I'm bionic, I'm supersonic

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna, M.I.A., Nicki]
Don’t play the stupid game
'Cause I’m a different kind of girl (I'm bionic)
Every record sounds the same
You’ve got to step into my world (Now move!)

[Chorus: Madonna]
Gimme all your luvin', give me your love
Give me all your love today
Gimme all your luvin', give me your love
Let’s forget about time, and dance our lives away
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Give me all your love today

["Radio Dial Static" Medley (Video Interlude)]

[Intro]
Alright, Miami, I think you know what to do next!
This next song I wanna hear everybody singing!
You got that?
Are you ready?

[Verse 1]
When the world starts to get you down
And nothing seems to go your way
And the noise of the maddening crowd
Makes you feel like you're going to go insane
There's a glow of a distant light
Calling you to come outside
To feel the wind on your face and your skin
And it's here I begin my story

[Chorus]
Turn up the radio
(Let me hear you!)
Turn up the radio
(Louder!)
Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

[Verse 2]
It was time that I opened my eyes
I'm leaving the past behind
Nothing's ever what it seems
Including this time and these crazy dreams
I'm stuck like a moth to a flame (Oh yeah)
I'm so tired of playing this game
I don't know how I got to this state
Let me out of my cage cause I'm dying

[Chorus]
Turn up the radio
(I can't hear you!)
Turn up the radio
(Don't ask me where I wanna go)
(We gotta turn up the radio)

Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
(Come on, everybody!)
Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

[Bridge]
I just wanna get in my car
I wanna go fast and I gotta go far
Don't ask me to explain how I feel
Cause I don't wanna say where I'm (going)
Turn down the noise and turn up the volume
Don't have a choice 'cause the temperature's pounding
If leaving this place is the last thing I do
Then I want to escape with some people just like (you)
Buzzing around like a moth to a flame
I'm so sick and tired of playing this game
We gotta have fun if it's all that we do
Gotta shake up the system and break all the rules
Gotta turn up the radio until the speakers blow

[Chorus]
Turn up the radio
(I can't hear you!)
Turn up the radio
Don't ask me where I wanna go, no
We gotta turn up the radio

[Outro]
Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
There's something you don't need to know, oh
Just let me turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Just let me turn up the radio
Just let me turn up the radio

[Intro: Madonna]
I'm winning my French beret
Last summer I went on holiday, to Biarritz
And for my birthday
These three fine young gentlemen sang for me
They're from the Basque Country
They're called the Kalakan Trio

[Verse 1: Madonna]
I see you on the street, and you walk on by
You make me wanna hang my head down and cry
If you gave me half a chance
You'd see my desire burning inside of me
But you choose to look the other way

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
I've had to work much harder than this
For something I want
Don't try to resist me

[Chorus: Madonna]
Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
(Open your heart to me, darling)
(I'll give you love if you, you turn the key)
(I think you know)

[Verse 2: Madonna]
I think that you're afraid to look in my eyes
You look a little sad, boy, I wonder why
(Don't cry)
I follow you around, but you can't see
You're too wrapped up in yourself to notice
So you choose to look the other way
Well, I've got something to say

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Don't try to run, I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying
You've got to

[Chorus: Madonna]
Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darling
(Can I help you?)
(I think this man wants do dance with me)
(Should I dance with him?)
(Alright, you guys sing!)

(Open your heart to me, baby)
(I hold the lock and you hold the key)
(Open your heart to me, darling)
(I'll give you love if you, you turn the key)

[Bridge]
Open your heart, I'll make you love me
(I think I need some help, Rocco)
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key
(I can't do this by myself!)

Open your heart, I'll make you love me
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key

Open your heart, I'll make you love me
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key

[Speech: Madonna]
Are y'all having a good time?
Did you take your MDNA before you got here? Fuck yeah!
I wanna thank all of my fans
Who have come here tonight from all around the world
I know there are people here from Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico... All over America!
I do not take your support and love for granted
Three decades is a long time to have a job
In this day and age most people don't have jobs
Believe me, I know how lucky I am
Thank you! We are all girls gone wild, yes!
Except for you, not you
You're a man, you're a real man
If you're really sure of who you are, it doesn't matter what people call you, does it?
If you're secure with yourself, they can call you any old name they want to, right?
They can call you a bitch, or a hoe, or whatever, gay, straight, bi, black, white, christian, muslim, buddhist...
We don't care, do we? Do we care?
Not my triangle bitches!
Why don't we care? Because we know what's important, it's what's on the inside! Fuck yeah!
And we are very fortunate to live in a country where we have the freedom to express ourselves and what we have to say on the inside!
Fuck yeah? (Fuck yeah!)
If you want to be a part of bringing peace into this world, you can start by treating the person standing next to you like a human being, ok? Now can I get a fuck yeah? (Fuck yeah!)
Do I have to teach Miami how to swear?
What's going on around here?  This place used to be so much fun!
I used to live here, people used to party all night long
What's- why are you even wearing a shirt?
Just take it off, baby
Show us what- have you been on the gym all day? All month? All year? Take it off
Let everybody love your body, ok?
And speaking of love

[Verse 1: Madonna]
If you were the Mona Lisa
You'd be hanging in the Louvre
Everyone would come to see you
You'd be impossible to move

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
It seems to me that's what you are
A rare and priceless work of art
You stay behind your velvet rope
But I will not renounce all hope

[Chorus: Madonna]
And I'm right by your side, like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why it hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece
'Cause, after all, nothing's indestructible

[Verse 2: Madonna]
From the moment I first saw you
All the darkness turned to white
An Impressionistic painting
Tiny particles of light

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
It seems to me that's what you're like
The "Look but please don't touch me" type
And honestly, it can't be fun
To always be the chosen one

[Chorus: Madonna]
And I'm right by your side, like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why it hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece (Masterpiece)
'Cause, after all, nothing's indestructible

[Breakdown: Madonna & Kalakan Trio]
Nothing's indestructible, nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible
And I'm right by your side, like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why it hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece

[Chorus: Madonna & Kalakan Trio, Madonna]
And I'm right by your side, like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why it hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece (Masterpiece)
'Cause, after all, nothing's indestructible
'Cause, after all, nothing's indestructible

[Verse 1]
Justify my love
Justify my love
For you to justify my love
Justify my love
Justify my love
I'm not afraid of who you are
We can fly
Come on, baby
My love, my love, my love
My love, my love, my love
You can fuck with me
My love, my love, my love
Justify, justify
My love, my love, my love
Pleasures

Naked
Fears
You put this in me
My love, my love, my love
So now what

Wanting, waiting
For you to justify my love
My love, my love, my love

For you to justify my love
Hoping, praying
For you to justify my love
Kiss me
That's right, kiss me
For you to justify my love
Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
I'm open and ready
For you to justify my love
To justify my love
Wanting to justify
Waiting
To justify my love
Praying
To justify my love
Love me
That's right
Love me

Don't just stand there
Don't don't don't just stand there
Ladies
Lay-lay-ladies
Let's get to it
Strike a pose there's nothing to it

[Verse 1]
Look around, everywhere you turn is heartache
It's everywhere that you go (Look around)
You try everything you can to escape
The pain of life that you know (Life that you know)
When all else fails and you long to be
Something better than you are today
I know a place where you can get away
It's called a dance floor, and here's what it's for, so

[Chorus]
Come on, vogue
Let your body move to the music (Move to the music)
Come on, vogue
Let your body go with the flow (Go with the flow)
You know you can do it

[Verse 2]
All you need is your own imagination
So use it that's what it's for (That's what it's for)
Go inside, for your finest inspiration
Your dreams will open the door (Open up the door)
It makes no difference if you're black or white
If you're a boy or a girl
If the music's pumping it will give you new life
You're a superstar, yes, that's what you are, you know it

[Chorus]
Come on, vogue
Let your body move to the music (Move to the music)
Come on, vogue
Let your body go with the flow (Go with the flow)
You know you can do it

Fellas that were in the mood
Don't just stand there, let's get to it
Strike a pose, there's nothing to it

It's human nature (It's human nature)
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me (It's human nature)

[Verse 1]
You wouldn't let me say the words I longed to say
You didn't want to see life through my eyes
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)
You tried to shove me back inside your narrow room
And silence me with bitterness and lies
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)

[Pre-Chorus]
Did I say something wrong?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex
(I must've been crazy)
Did I stay too long?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't speak my mind
(What was I thinking?)

[Chorus]
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
It's human nature (It's human nature)
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me (It's human nature)

[Verse 2]
You punished me for telling you my fantasies
I'm breaking all the rules I didn't make
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)
You took my words and made a trap for silly fools
You held me down and tried to make me break
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)

[Pre-Chorus]
Did I say something true?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex
(I must've been crazy)
Did I have a point of view?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about you
(What was I thinking?)

[Refrain]
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself

[Chorus]
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
(I don't have to justify anything)
(I'm just like you)
It's human nature (It's human nature)
(Why should I be?)
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
(Deal with it)
I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me

[Intro]
And if you have a problem with my ass...
Then you can kiss it

[Verse 1]
I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was until I found you
I was beat, incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue, but you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel shiny and new

[Chorus]
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats next to mine

(Pussy)
(If you're gonna look at the crack of my ass you might as well give me a tip)

[Verse 2]
Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you, 'cause only love can last
You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah you make me bold, oh your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out what was scared and cold

[Chorus]
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats next to...
Mine

[Verse: Madonna]
You had all of me, you wanted more
Would you have married me if I were poor?
I guess if I was your treasury
You'd have found the time to treasure me

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
How come you can't see
All that you need is right here with me?
Up until the end
All this pretend wasn't for free

[Chorus: Madonna]
Hold me like your money
Tell me that you want me
Spend your love on me, spend your love on me
Now you have your money
Spend it 'til there's nothing
Spend your love on me, spend your love on me

[Post-Chorus: Priscilla Renea]
Oo nah oo nah oo nah ahh me taahb
Oo nah oo nah ahh me taahb
Ee plu-ri-bus u-num rah

[Refrain: Madonna]
I want you to take me like you took my money
Take me in your arms until your last breath
I want you to hold me like you held my money
Hold onto me 'til there's nothing left

[Breakdown: Madonna]
Love spent
Feeling love spent
Yeah, I'm love spent
Wondering where the love went
Love spent
Yeah, I'm love spent
Feeling love spent
Wondering where it all went

[Refrain: Madonna]
I want you to take me like you took my money
Take me in your arms until your last breath
I want you to hold me like you held my money
Hold onto me 'til there's nothing left

[Outro: Madonna]
You played with my heart
"Till death do we part," that's what you said
Now you have your flash car, women and bars
It's gone 'till your head

[Intro]
I don't want no lies
I don't watch TV
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine

[Verse 1]
I've had so many lives
Since I was a child
And I realize
How many times I've died
I'm not that kind of guy
Sometimes I feel shy
I think I can fly

[Refrain]
Nobody, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me

[Verse 2]
This world is not so kind
People trap your mind
It's so hard to find
Someone to admire

[Refrain]
Nobody, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me

[Chorus]
No one's telling you how to live your life
But it's a setup until you're fed up
It's no good when you're misunderstood
But why should I care
What the world thinks of me?
Won't let a stranger
Give me a social disease

[Refrain]
Nobody, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Give me a social disease
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

[Chorus]
No one's telling me how to live my life
But it's a setup and I'm just fed up
It's no good when you're misunderstood
But why should I care
What the world thinks of me?
Won't let a stranger
Give me a social disease

[Breakdown]
I don't want no lies
I don't watch TV

[Verse 1]
When did your name change from a word to a charm?
No other sound makes the hair stand up on the back of my arm
All of the letters push to the front of my mouth and saying your name
Is somewhere between a prayer and a shout
And I can't get it out
When did your name change from language to magic?
I'd write it again off the back of my hand and I know it sounds tragic

[Pre-Chorus]
Your name’s like a drug
And I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to your love! (I'm addicted to your love!)
I'm addicted to your love!
I'm addicted, I'm addicted
I'm addicted to your...
...I'm addicted, I'm addicted
I'm addicted to your love!

[Verse 2]
Now that your name pumps like a blood in my veins
It pulses through my body, igniting my mind
And it's like MDMA, and that's okay

[Pre-Chorus]
Your name’s like a drug
And I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to your love!
I'm addicted, I'm addicted
I'm addicted to your...
...I'm addicted, I'm addicted
I'm addicted to your love!

[Bridge]
I need this exchange
I don't care if you think that I'm strange
Something happens to me when I hear your voice
Something happens to me and I have no choice
I need to hear your name
Everything feels so strange
I'm willing to take this chance
I need to dance!

[Pre-Chorus]
Your name’s like a drug
And I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to your love!
I'm addicted, I'm addicted
I'm addicted to your...
...I'm addicted, I'm addicted
I'm addicted to your love!

Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home
(Come on, Miami!)

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Verse 1]
I hear your voice
(Let's sing this together)
(It's like an angel sighing)
I have no choice
I hear your voice
(Feels like flying)
I close my eyes
(Oh God, I think I'm falling)
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
(Heaven, help me)

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour

Like a child
(Here we go)
(You whisper softly to me)
You're in control
Just like a child
(I'm gonna give you another chance)
(Now I'm dancing)
It's like a dream
(No end and no beginning)
You're here with me
It's like a dream
(Let the choir sing)

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there

Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

[Bridge]
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
It's like a dream to me (Oh, feels like I'm dreaming)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
It's like a dream to me (Oh yeah, oh ye-ye-ye-yeah)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (Oh, feels like I'm dreaming)
It's like a dream to me (Oh, yeah yeah)

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
(In the midnight hour)
(I can feel your power)
(Just like a prayer)
(You know I'll take you there)

When you call my name

You look familiar
You wanna dance? Yeah
Come join party, yeah
Let's get this started, yeah
Oh yeah
All right, Miami!
I wanna see you dance

[Verse 1]
I think you wanna come over
Yeah, I heard it through the grapevine
Are you drunk? Are you sober?
Think about it, doesn't matter
And if it makes you feel good, then I say do it
I don't know what you're waiting for

[Verse 2]
Boy you got a reputation
But you’re gonna have to prove it
I see a little hesitation, am I gonna have to show you
That if it feels right, get on your mark
Step to the beat boy, that's what it's for

[Interlude]
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey

[Pre-Chorus]
Put your arms around me
When it gets too hot we can go outside
But for now just come here, let me whisper in your ear
An invitation to the dance of life

[Chorus]
Come join party, yeah
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started, yeah
'Cause everybody wants to party with you

[Interlude]
What are you waiting for? Nobody's gonna show you how
(Come on, ladies)
Why work for someone else to do what you can do right now?
Gimme the baseline, and I'll shake it
Gimme a record, and I'll break it
There's no beginning and no ending
You wanna dance? Yeah
Give me a chance to go, and I'll take it
I guess I just don't recognize you with your clothes on
What are you waiting for?
Give it to me, yeah!
No one's gonna show me how
Give it to me, yeah!
No one's gonna stop me now

[Chorus]
Come join party
It's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won't do

Thank you
Good night
And we are off this ship
Whew!

[Intro]
Dark and dreary
The afternoons are weary
And I've got to get in the endless line

[Verse 1]
Crowded highway
Going my way-ay-ay

[Verse 2]
Still I somehow get the feeling I'm all alone

[Outro]
Lonely, Lonely, Lonely days
I feel alone in so many ways
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely guy
Me oh my

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
The talk among the skeletons this morning
(Aside from all the medicine and health)
If you could do it all again, would you do it all the same?
Is there something that you'd tell your former self?

There were those that wished they'd spun upon the jukebox
There were pirates who had never seen the sea
But the one recurring theme, the one recurring dream they had
Was to be whatever they wanted to be

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Will Champion]
"To be Pyotr Tchaikovsky
To be free, and like everyone else
There will be no flags to own me, no!
'Cause I just want to be myself"

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
Julie, telephoning by a ouija
"Is there any advice that you could give?
When you know you're not like them
Do you know La Varsovienne?
I know that I am living, but can you show me how to live?"

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Will Champion]
And the Holy Roman Army
Said, "Your heart beats like everyone else"
But you don't need no flags to tell you who you are, so say
"I just want to be myself''

[Interlude: Chris Martin]
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Will Champion]
There's an aura that surrounds thee
There's a different kind of wealth
And I don't need flags to know you're really something
And I just love you for yourself
Oh, I just love you for yourself

[Outro: Chris Martin]
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

[Verse 1]
What can I tell you?
When I'm with you, I'm walking on air
Watching you sleeping there, yeah
And what can't I get through?
When for everyone, everywhere
You're answering every prayer

[Chorus]
And when you're riding a wave
Oh, won't you ride that wave to me?
When you're setting your sail
Oh, can I be your seventh sea?
When you're riding a wave
Oh, when you're riding a wave

[Bridge]
'Cause when I'm hurt
Then I'll go to your church
'Cause when I'm hurt
Then I'll go to your church

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
When you're riding a wave
Oh, won't you ride that wave to me?
When you're riding a wave

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Trouble in town
Because they cut my brother down
Because my sister can't wear her crown
There's trouble, there's trouble in town
Blood on the beat (Oh-oh)
Oh my goodness, there's blood on the beat
Law of the jungle or the law of the street
There's blood on, there's blood on the beat

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
And I get no shelter
And I get no peace
And I never get released

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
Trouble in town (Oh-oh)
Because they hung my Brother Brown
Because their system just keep you down
There's trouble, there's trouble in town

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
And I get no shelter
And I get no peace
And I just get more police, eh
And I get no comfort
And I get no name
Everything is gettin' strange

[Interlude: Young Men & Police Officer Philip Nace, Chris Martin]
Best friends
What's that?
What's his name?
X (Standby, sir)
Alright, is that X your middle name?
Of course, it's on a vehicle ID, right? (There must be some way)
You gettin' smart? 'Cause you'll be in a fucking car with him
I'm telling you
Fucking smartass (Or it's gonna kick off someday)
I'm asking you what the X is, is that your middle name?
Of course, what is it?
Don't come back with the "What is it?" fucking shit (There must be some way)
Talk to these fucking pigs on the street that way, you ain't talking to me that way
I don't talk to nobody in the streets, I don't hang with nobody
Well, then don't come to fucking Philadelphia, stay in Jersey
I have family out here
Everybody thinks they're a fucking lawyer and they don't know jack shit
Are you supposed to grab me like this?
Grab you up? I'll grab you any way I got to
You're not protecting me by stopping me while I'm trying to go to work
Why don't you shut up?

Oh Lord (Ooh-ooh)
Come shine your light on me (Shine your light on me)

[Verse 3: Chris Martin, Choir]
Oh, shine your light (Oh, shine your light)
Oh, shine a light (Oh, shine a light)
And I know (Ooh-ooh)
That in the darkness I'm alright (I'm alright)
See there's no sun rising (Ooh-ooh)
But inside I'm free (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause the Lord will shine a light for me
(Shine a light on me)
Oh, the Lord will shine a light on me
(Shine your light on me)
Sing it now

[Outro]
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm, hmm-oh
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm, hmm-oh
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm, hmm-oh
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm

[Verse 1]
Daddy, are you out there?
Daddy, won't you come and play?
Daddy, do you not care?
Is there nothing that you wanna say?

[Pre-Chorus]
I know
You're hurting too
But I need you, I do
Daddy, if you're out there
Daddy, all I want to say

[Chorus]
You're so far away
Oh, you're so far away
That's okay, it's okay
I'm okay

[Verse 2]
Daddy, are you out there?
Daddy, why'd you run away?
Daddy, are you okay?
Look, Dad, we got the same hair
And Daddy, it's my birthday
And all I wanna say

[Chorus]
Is you're so far away
Oh, and you're so far away
That's okay, it's okay
It's okay

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) You're so far away

[Outro]
Won't you come and won't you stay?
Please stay, oh, please stay
Won't you come and won't you stay?
One day, just one day

[Verse 1]
In a world gone wrong
I shall be strong
Wonder of the world, power of the people
I will not want
My faith is strong
Wonder of the world, power of the people

[Verse 2]
Our world tonight
Get it right
Holding on to the steeple
Our world tonight
I'm off in light
Wonder of the world, power of the people

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Take it from the playgrounds and take it from the bums
Take it from the hospitals and squeeze it from the slums
All the kids make pistols with their fingers and their thumbs
Advertise a revolution, arm it when it comes
We're cooking up the zeros, we've been doing all the sums
The judgment of this court is we need more guns

[Refrain]
Stop

[Chorus]
Everything's gone so crazy
Everything tangled in blue
Everyone's gone fucking crazy
Maybe I'm crazy too

[Verse 2]
Melt down all the trumpets, all the trombones and the drums
Who needs education or A Thousand Splendid Suns?
Poor is good for business, cut the forests, they're so dumb
Only save your look-alikes and fuck the other ones
It's the opinion of this board that we need more guns

[Refrain]
Stop

[Chorus]
Everything's gone so crazy
Everybody but you
Everything's gone fucking crazy
Maybe I'm crazy too

[Intro]
Ah-hmm

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Joseph rode in on a beam of light
Stray dogs to welcome him, fights, corrugate cathedrals
The sight of the pilgrims going nowhere in millions of cars

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
Lagos a dream in the distance
From promises he'd made behind
Where there was no harvest
But he missed the sky and its circus
And countless, the stars

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
In Africa
The rivers are perfectly deep
And beautifully wide
In Africa
The mothers will sing you to sleep
And say, "It's alright, child
It's alright"

[Bridge]
Yeah
Ah-hmm
Ah-hmm

[Chorus: Chris Martin and Tiwa Savage, Chris Martin]
In Africa
We dance in the water and hold
Each other so tight
In Africa
The mothers will sing you to sleep
And say, "It's alright, child
It's alright"

[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
Joseph rode in on a beam of light
And dreamed of his queen by his side
There'll be a beautiful sunset
And you'll be a beautiful bride

[Intro: Jacob Collier]
Cry, cry, cry, baby
Cry, cry, cry

[Verse: Chris Martin & Jacob Collier]
In a book about the world
Called The Luminous Things
There are trees and flowers glowing
While Jizo Bodhisattva sings

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Jacob Collier]
When you cry, cry, cry, baby
When you cry, cry, cry
When you cry, cry, cry, baby
I'll be by your side

[Bridge: Chris Martin & Jacob Collier]
(Dum-dum-dum) Don't want us to hurt each other (Dum-dum-dum)
Or cause each other pain (Dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum)
(Dum-dum-dum) Don't want to fear what we don't know (Dum-dum-dum)
(Dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum)
(Dum-dum-dum) We're in this together, baby (Dum-dum-dum)
We're as singing is to rain (Dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum)
So I'll never, ever, ever let you go (Dum-dum-dum)

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Jacob Collier]
When you cry, cry, cry, baby
When you cry, cry, cry
When you cry, cry, cry, baby
I'll be by your side
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Chris Martin & Jacob Collier]
For your miracles outnumber
All the stars out in the sky

[Verse]
Tony was a friend of mine
We were together all the time
He had my back
Once he really saved my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I wanna call him
Say, "Hey, let's stay up 'til morning"

[Chorus]
And when I close my eyes, when I close my eyes
I see you, you
When I close my eyes, when I close my eyes
You come through, you
Time just deepens
Sweetens and mends
Old friends

[Outro]
We all melt back into the picture
Raindrops back into the water
Old friends
Hmm, hmm
And there are no ends to old friends
Amen

[Intro: 'Otuto Nke Chukwu']
Gi nwa nke chukwu, gini ka ina ekwu
N'ihi ihe nile
Nke chukwu mere

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I tried my best to be just like
The other boys in school
I tried my best to get it right
And died at every duel
This mountainside is suicide
This dream will never work
Still the sign upon my headstone, write
"A champion of the world"

[Interlude]
Oh oh-oh
Oh oh-oh-oh oh oh

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I tried my best to stay alight
Fly like a firework
I tried my best at taking flight
But my rocket ship reversed
Oh, referee, don't stop the fight
Everyone can see I'm hurt
But I'll stand before conquistadors
Till I'm champion of the world

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Chris & Will]
(When I sail) And when I sail
I'm sailing west
(Know I might fail) Knowing I might fail
But still I'm hoping for the best
(In my dreams) And in my dreams
Onto my chest
She'll pin the colours and say
"I wandered the whole wide world but
Baby, you're the best"

[Interlude: Chris Martin]
Lo lo-lo-lo lo oh
Ee-yo-ee-yo-ee-yo-ee-yeah
Lo lo-lo-lo lo

[Outro: Chris Martin & Will Champion]
So I'm flying on my bicycle
Heading upwards from the Earth
I am jumping with no parachute
Out into the universe
I have E.T. on my bicycle
Because giving up won't work
Now I'm riding on my rocketship
And I'm champion of the world

[Verse 1]
What in the world are we going to do?
Look at what everybody's going through
What kind of world do you want it to be?
Am I the future or the history?

[Chorus]
'Cause everyone hurts, everyone cries
Everyone tells each other all kinds of lies
Everyone falls, everybody dreams and doubts
Got to keep dancing when the lights go out

[Verse 2]
How in the world am I going to see
You as my brother, not my enemy?

[Chorus]
'Cause everyone hurts, everyone cries
Everyone sees the colour in each other's eyes
Everyone loves, everybody gets their hearts ripped out
Got to keep dancing when the lights go out
Gonna keep dancing when the lights go out
Hold tight for everyday life
Hold tight for everyday life

[Outro]
At first light, throw my arms out, open wide
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelu-halle-hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelu-halle-hallelujah
Yes

[Chorus]
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take
To free the celestial body?

[Verse 1]
From way up there, it looks so small
From way down here, it looks so small
One peculiar organism aren't we all together?
Everybody steps on ants
Everybody eats the plants
Everybody knows to dance, even with just one finger

[Chorus]
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take
To free the celestial body?

[Verse 2]
When I took another look
The past was not a history book
That was just some linear perception
Ash to ask and dust to dusk
A dime a dozen, aren't we just?
But a dozen dimes will buy a crust of garlic bread

[Chorus]
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take
To free the celestial body?

[Verse 3]
When I say celestial
I mean extraterrestrial
I mean accepting the alien you've rejected in your own heart
When I say heart, I mean finish
The last one there is a potato knish
Baking too long in the sun of Spud Infinity
When I say infinity, I mean now
Kiss the one you are right now
Kiss your body up and down, other than your elbows
'Cause as for your elbows, they're on their own
Wandering like a rolling stone
Rubbing up against the edges of experience

[Chorus]
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take
To free the celestial body?

[Outro]
Woo

[Spoken Intro]
OK people, we're just getting this party started!
This is a no-sitting-down-song, people over there in the seats
Come on, get up!
I want to see you dancing

[Intro]
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Verse 1]
I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, help me

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Verse 2]
Like a child
You whisper softly to me
You're in control
Just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me
It's like a dream
Let the choir sing

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Interlude]
Come on put your hands together!
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

[Chorus]
Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

[Bridge]
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me

[Chorus]
Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

[Outro]
Like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Like a prayer
Take me there
Like a prayer
Thank you

Sunny
Yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny
You smiled at me and really eased the pain

For the dark days are done
And the bright days are here
My sunny one shines... so sincere
Sunny one, so true...I love you

Sunny, sunny...
Thank you...for the sunshine bouquet
Su-unny...
Thank you for the love you brought my way

You gave to me your all and all
Now I feel just about 10 feet tall
Sunny one, so true...I love you

Sunny, sunny, sunny, sunny
Thank you for the smile upon your face
Sunny, sunny
Thank you for that gleam that flows with grace
You're my spark of nature's fire
You are my sweet, complete desire
Sunny one, so true...I love you

Sunny one, so true...I love you

[Verse 1]
My mind won't let me rest, voice in my head
I hear what it says, I can't trust a thing
If I picked up and left, how fast would you forget?

[Pre-Chorus]
Restin' while I'm inside your presence
I don't wanna think nothin' bad
This time I won't, this time I won't

[Chorus]
Five A.M. when I walked in (Walked in)
Could not believe what I saw, yeah (Saw, yeah)
You were on another one's body (Body)
Ghosts of the past came to haunt me (Haunt me)
I caught you but you never caught me (Caught me)
I was sitting here waiting on karma (Karma)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)
Five A.M. when I walked in (Walked in)
Could not believe what I saw, yeah (Saw, yeah)
You were on another one's body (Body)
Ghosts of the past came to haunt me (Haunt me)
I caught you but you never caught me (Caught me)
I was sitting here waiting on karma (Karma)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)

[Verse 2]
No, I won't let you stay
Thanks for the hours, thanks for the days
If I see your eyes, I turn to stone
I look away, I gotta go
Gone for the week, don't bother
'Til pigs fly, she'll keep on callin'
I been workin' for me, not sorry
Next time that we speak'll be calmly
Next time that I go in, I'm all in
Why you so close but you feel so far?
You look the moon in the mornin'
Jaded, faded, almost gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Restin' while I'm inside your presence
I don't wanna think nothin' bad
Goodnights are never really good nights, nights, nights
Feel something that's heavy inside

[Chorus]
Five A.M. when I walked in (Walked in)
Could not believe what I saw, yeah (Saw, yeah)
You were on another one's body (Body)
Ghosts of the past came to haunt me (Haunt me)
I caught you but you never caught me (Caught me)
I was sitting here waiting on karma (Karma)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)
Five A.M. when I walked in (Walked in)
Could not believe what I saw, yeah (Saw, yeah)

Ghosts of the past came to haunt me (Haunt me)
I caught you but you never caught me (Caught me)
I was sitting here waiting on karma (Karma)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)

[ Verse 1 ]:

I do remember
When the sunlight had a special kind of brightness
And the laughter held a lover's kind of lightness;
Yellow days...yellow days

[ Verse 2 ]:

She would hold me
And a smile would spread around us so completely
And the softness of a kiss would linger sweetly;
Yellow days...yellow days

[ Chorus 1 ]:

But then came thunder
And I heard her say goodbye through tears of wonder;
Now I'm all alone and my heart wants to know:
"Yellow days, where'd you go?"

[ Chorus 2 ]:

Life is empty
And the sunlight seems so harsh instead of tender
And the laughter's just an echo I'll remember...
From yellow days...yellow days

[ musical interlude ]

[ Chorus 1 ]:

But then came thunder
And I heard her say goodbye through tears of wonder;
Now I'm all alone and my heart wants to know:
"Yellow days, where did you go?"

[ Chorus 2 ]:

All life is empty
And the sunlight seems so harsh instead of tender
And the laughter's just an echo I'll remember...
From yellow days...yellow days

[ Outro ]:

Yellow days...mellow days...yellow days

[Intro]
Prophecy
Prophecy
Prophecy

[Verse 1]
Blessed is he who reads aloud the words of the prophecy
And blessed are those who hear
And who keep what is written therein
For the time is near
He is coming with the clouds
And every eye will see him
Everyone who pierced him
And all the tribes of the earth will wail on account of him
Those of you who have not learned
What some call the deep things of Satan
I know your works
I know your toil
And your patient endurance
And how you cannot hear evil men
But have tested those who call themselves
Apostles
But are not
And found them to be false
I know you are enduring patiently
And bearing out
For my namesake
And you have not grown weary
But I have this against you
That you have abandoned
The love you had
And I saw a beast rising out of the sea
With ten horns and seven heads
And a blasphemous name upon its head
And the beast that I saw was like a leopard
Its feet were like a bear's
And its mouth was like a lion's mouth
And to it the dragon gave his power
And the whole earth followed the beast with wonder
And they worshipped the beast saying
"Who is like the beast and who can fight against the beast?"
It opened its mouth to utter blasphemous
Words
Against
God

[Verse 2]
It was allowed to make war on the saints
And to conquer them
And authority was given it over every tribe
And a people and tongue and nation
And all who dwell on earth could worship it
In vain
If anyone has an ear let him hear
If anyone who slays with the sword, then he must be slain

[Verse 3]
Then
I saw a new heaven
And a new earth
And I heard a great voice from the throne saying
"Behold the dwelling of God is with men
He will dwell with them
And they shall be his people
And God himself will be with them
He will wipe away every tear from their eyes
And death shall be no more
Neither shall there be mourning
Nor crying
Nor pain
Anymore
For these things will have passed away
To the thirsty I will give water without price
From the fountain of the water of life
He who conquers shall have this heritage
And I will be his God and he shall be my son
But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted
As for the murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolators
And all liars
Their lot shall be in the lake that burns with fire
And he said to me
(Prophecy)
"Do not seal up the words of the prophecy
For the time is near
Behold, I am coming soon."

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Uhh

[Verse 1]
Cigarette, mmm, that I never got a chance to hit, chance to hit
But in my mind, yeah, baby, I can taste your lips
Taste your lips, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I was so foolish, on some stupid shit
Now I see you all alone, hey
You not in my bed, messes with my head
Lost my chance to turn you out

[Chorus]
So I'll never get over
Never get over not getting under you
Getting under you
No, I'll never get over
Never get over not getting under you
Getting under you

[Verse 2]
Poured a glass, mmm, but I never got to take a sip
Take a sip, oh
I've been around the world (Around the world, around the world)
But baby, you're my only fix
My only fix
Ohh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I was so foolish, on some stupid shit
Now I see you all alone, hey
You not in my bed, messes with my head
Lost my chance to turn you out

[Chorus]
So I'll never get over (Never get over)
Never get over not getting under you
Getting under you (Oh)
No, I'll never get over (I'll never)
Never get over not getting under you (Under you)
Getting under you

[Bridge]
Had a heart attack
Full speed, swerve off track
(Exclusive) Can't breathe
Where you at? (Hey) Where you at? (Yeah)
Since you been ain't where I'm at
If I could I'd take it back
I can't get you off my mind
It could 

[??] all the time

[Chorus]
So I'll never get over (Never get over)
Never get over not getting under you
Getting under you (Can't get over)
No, I'll never get over (I'll never get over)
Never get over not getting under you
Getting under you (Hey)
So I'll never get over
Never get over not getting under you
Getting under you (under you, oh)
No, I'll never get over (I'll never)
Never get over
Not getting under you
Getting under you

Getting under you
Uh-huh
Yeah, ahh, ahh, under you

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna wake up, yes and no
I'm gonna kiss some part of
I'm gonna keep this secret
I'm gonna close my body now

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess, die another day
I guess, I'll die another day
I guess, die another day
I guess, I'll die another day

[Chorus]
I guess I'll die another day (Another day)
I guess I'll die another day (Another day)
I guess I'll die another day (Another day)
I guess I'll die another day

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna break the cycle
I'm gonna shake up the system
I'm gonna destroy my ego
I'm gonna close my body now

[Chorus]
I think I'll find another way
There's so much more to know
I guess I'll die another day
It's not my time to go
For every sin, I'll have to pay
A time to work, a time to play
I think I'll find another way
It's not my time to go

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna avoid the cliché
I'm gonna suspend my senses
I'm gonna delay my pleasure
I'm gonna close my body now

[Chorus]
I guess, die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I guess, die another day
I guess I'll die another day

[Outro]
Another day
Another day
Another day
Another day
Another day
It's not my time to go

[Verse 1]
I've had so many lives
Since I was a child
And I realize
How many times I've died
I'm not that kind of guy
Sometimes I feel shy
I think I can fly
Closer to the sky

[Chorus]
No one's telling you how to live your life
But it's a setup until you're fed up

[Verse 2]
This world is not so kind
People trap your mind
It's so hard to find
Someone to admire
I, I sleep much better at night
I feel closer to the light
Now I'm gonna try
To improve my life

[Chorus]
No one's telling you how to live your life
But it's a setup until you're fed up
It's no good when you're misunderstood
But why should I care
What the world thinks of me?
Won't let a stranger
Give me a social disease

[Refrain]
Nobody, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

[Chorus]
No one's telling me how to live your life
But it's a setup and I'm just fed up
It's no good when you're misunderstood
But why should I care
What the world thinks of me?
Won't let a stranger
Give me a social disease

[Verse 3]
I sleep much better at night
I feel closer to the light
Now I'm gonna try
To improve my life

[Outro]
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me
(Nobody knows me)
It's no fun, but the damage is done
(Nobody knows me)
(Nobody knows me)
Don't want your social disease
(Li-like you know me)
Like you know me
Like you know me
Like you know me
Like you know me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me

[Intro]
Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

[Verse 1]
I tried to be a boy
I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess
I tried to be the best
I guess I did it wrong
That's why I wrote this song
This type of modern life, is it for me?
This type of modern life, is it for free?

[Verse 2]
So, I went into a bar
Looking for sympathy
A little company
I tried to find a friend
It's more easily said
It's always been the same
This type of modern life, is it for me?
This type of modern life, is it for free?

[Chorus]
American Life (American Life)
I live the American Dream (American Dream)
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream (American Life)
American life
American dream
American life
American dream

[Post-Chorus]
Do I have to change my name?
Am I gonna be a star?
Do I have to change my name?
Am I gonna be a star?

[Verse 3]
I'm drinking a soy latte
I get a double shot-e
It goes right through my body, and you know I'm satisfied
I drive my Mini Cooper, and I'm feeling super-dooper
Yo, they tell I'm a trooper, and you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and pilates, and the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out the bodies, and you know I'm satisfied
I'm digging on the isotopes
This metaphysics shit is dope, and if all this can give me hope
You know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager, an agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant, and a driver, and a jet
A trainer, and a butler, and a bodyguard, or five
A gardener and a stylist
Do you think I'm satisfied?
I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just living out the American dream
And I just realized that nothing Is what it seems

[Outro]
Do I have to change my name?
Am I gonna be a star?
Do I have to change my name?
Am I gonna be a star?
(American life) Do I have to...?
(American dream)
(American life) Do I have to...?
(American dream)
Do I have to change?

[Intro]
Are you having a good time?
Me too

[Verse 1]
There was a time I was happy in my life
There was a time I believed I'd live forever
There was a time that I prayed to Jesus Christ
There was a time I had a mother, it was nice

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh mother, why aren't you here with me?
No one else saw the things that you could see
I'm trying hard to dry my tears
Yes father, you know I'm not so free

[Verse 2]
Nobody else would ever take the place of you
Nobody else could do the things that you could do
No one else I guess could hurt me like you did
I didn't understand, I was just a kid

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh mother, why aren't you here with me?
No one else saw the things that you could see
I'm trying hard to dry my tears
Yes father, you know I'm not so free

[Chorus]
I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for

I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for

[Verse 3]
My mother died when I was five
And all I did was sit and cry
I cried and cried and cried all day
Until the neighbors went away
They couldn't take my loneliness, I couldn't take their phoniness
My father had to go to work, I used to think he was a jerk
I didn't know his heart was broken
Not another word was spoken
He became a shadow of
The father I was dreaming of
I made a vow that I would never need another person ever
Turned my heart into a cage, a victim of a kind of rage

[Interlude]
I got to save my baby
Because he makes me cry
I got to make him happy
I got to teach him how to fly
I got to take him higher
Way up like a bird in the sky
I got to calm him down now
I got to save his life

[Chorus]
I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
Find somebody to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for
I've got to give it up
Find somebody to love me
Find someone that I can care for

[Outro]
I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
I've got to let it go
I've got to give it up
I've got to let it go
Oh mother, oh father
I've got to give it up
Oh mother, oh father
I've got to give it up

Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night, I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight I want to dance with someone else

[Interlude]

Misdemeanor on the

Made a way for all my niggas to get paid to say the least
Made it way up out my city and they can't even believe
Niggas saying shit on Twitter that they can't even delete

Administration, bills and loans
Come with me
Come with me
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the demonstration of this evidence
Some have called it religion
This is not a coincidence
Would you like to try?

[Verse 1]
Connect to the sky
Future lovers ride
Their ambitions high
Would you like to try?

[Verse 2]
Let me be your guide
Put aside your pride
Future lovers hide
Love inside their eyes

[Chorus]
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance

[Verse 3]
Not controlled by time
Future lovers shine
For eternity
In a world that's free

[Verse 4]
Put away your past
Love will never last
If you're holding on
To a dream that's gone

[Interlude]
I'm gonna tell you about love
Would you like to try?

[Chorus]
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance

[Interlude]
There's no love like the future love
Come with me
Ooh
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I feel love
Ooh
It's so good, it's so good
It's so good, it's so good

[Intro]
All right, London
Are you ready to ride with me?
I said: are you ready?
Are you ready?

[Verse 1]
I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was until I found you
I was beat, incomplete, I'd been had
I was sad and blue, but you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel shiny and new

[Chorus]
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats next to mine

[Verse 2]
Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you, 'cause only love can last
You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah, you make me bold
Oh, your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out what was scared and cold

[Chorus]
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats next to mine

[Intro]
Thank you for coming to our show!
The night is young
And the show
Has just begun

[Verse 1]
I haven't got much time to waste, it's time to make my way
I'm not afraid of what I'll face, but I'm afraid to stay
I'm going down my own road and I can make it alone
I'll work and I'll fight till I find a place of my own

[Chorus]
Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump, just take my hands
Get ready to jump

[Verse 2]
We learned our lesson from the start, my sisters and me
The only thing you can depend on is your family
Life's gonna drop you down like the limbs of a tree
It sways and it swings and it bends until it makes you see

[Chorus]
Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump, just take my hand
Get ready to, are you ready?

[Verse 3]
I'll work and I'll fight till I find a place of my own
It sways and it swings and it bends until you make it your own

[Breakdown]
I can make it alone
I can make it alone
I can make it alone
I can make it alone
I can make it alone
I can make it alone
I can make it alone
I can make it alone

[Chorus]
Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump, just take my hand
Get ready to jump
Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump, just take my hand
Get ready to, are you ready?

[Outro]

[Intro]
I have a tale to tell

[Verse 1]
I was three feet from the floor, gasping for air
Trying to release my fathers hands from my throat
I looked into his eyes and wondered
If my feet would ever touch the floor again

Have you ever been hit so hard that it sends your body flying across the room?
We all fall to the floor at some point
It's how you pick yourself up, that's the real challenge
Isn't it?

I've always lived in my own world
I dance to escape my troubles
I've learnt that there's light even in the darkest places
I can't blame my father for anything
You can't rely on other people to make you happy
But I know deep down inside
He loved me

[Verse 2]
It was a time
I suffered so much I wanted to get it out of me
I would cut my arms
Not to kill myself, I don't want to die
I know I am lucky to be on this Earth

I did it so the physical pain would calm the pain that was eating me inside
Nothing was erased
I live with my past tucked away, deep inside of me
It comes out as an explosion and
It invades me

I believe we are messengers on Earth
I believe in angels
I am blessed by God to tell myself I suffered that much to become who I am today

[Verse 3]
Now you have to realize
Not only do I have a family but now I have a whole hood
And that's power
But I ain't no primy ass nigga
I was never out to kill anybody
Specially when I made that decision of gang bang
I just wanted to fit in
But one day
I was forced to do something that made me open my eyes
And realize that this ain't no game
One of the homies got popped
And I was the first one doing my first drop by
It was kinda fucked up the way they tried to set me up

Me and my bro, we was headed back to the A block
Then some homies rolled up
And they asked us to go somewhere
We pulled up to the corner
Then he pressed the chunky ass gun in my lap
He said, "you know what to do really
It's time to get poppy for the hood"
But I wasn't out to kill anybody

[Verse 1]
I don't like cities, but I like New York

Baby, you can keep, baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep, baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep, baby, you can keep

[Verse 2]
If you don't like my attitude then you can fuck off
Just go to Texas, where you can suck George Bush's dick
New York is not for little pussies who scream
If you can't stand the heat, then get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, yeah!

Now I can tell you about success, about fame
About the rise and the fall of all the stars in the sky
Don't it make you smile?

[Verse 2]
Now I can tell you about the place I belong
You know it won't last long
And all those lights they will turn down

[Chorus]
Let it will be
Oh, let it be
Just let it be
Won't you let it be?

[Post-Chorus]
Now I can see things for what they really are
You know I'm not that far

[Intro: Madonna]
Feelings, feelings, feelings
My craving get dangerous
My craving get dangerous

[Verse 1: Madonna]
I'm tired of being far away from home
Far from what can help, far from where it's safe
Hope it's not too late
Rush, rush, rush on you, love, love, loved on you
Love you like a fool, put my trust in you

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna & Swae Lee]
'Cause you're the one I crave
And my cravings get dangerous
The feelings never fade
I don't think we should play with this
Say come, come give me strength
I don't think we should wait for this
'Cause you're the one I crave

[Chorus: Madonna]
Ooh, my cravings get dangerous
Ooh, I don't think we should play with this
Ooh, my cravings get dangerous
Ooh, I don't think we should wait

[Verse 2: Madonna]
'Cause I'm just me, that's all I can be
Something real, something I can feel
You know I just can't change, this is how I'm made
I'm not afraid, take me to the place

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna, Swae Lee & Both]
You're the one I crave (Crave)
And my cravings get dangerous
The feelings never fade
I don't think we should play with this
Say come, come give me strength
I don't think we should wait for this
'Cause you're the one I crave

[Chorus: Madonna]
Ooh, my cravings get dangerous
Ooh, my cravings get dangerous
Ooh, I don't think we should play with this
Ooh, my cravings get dangerous
Ooh, I don't think we should wait

[Post-Chorus: Madonna]
Feelings, feelings
Feelings, feelings

[Bridge: Madonna]
Ran so far to try to find the thing I lacked and there it was
Inside of me
Ran and ran and ran so fast, a thing to last, and there it was
I hear you breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna, Swae Lee & Both]
You're the one I crave (Crave)
And my cravings get dangerous
The feelings never fade
I don't think we should play with this
Say come, come give me strength
I don't think we should wait for this
'Cause you're the one I crave

[Chorus: Madonna]
Ooh, my cravings get dangerous
Ooh, I don't think we should play with this
Ooh, my cravings get dangerous
Ooh, I don't think we should wait
My cravings get dangerous

[Post-Chorus: Madonna]
Feelings, feelings
Feelings, feelings
Feelings, feelings
Feelings, feelings

[Verse 1]
I can't remember when we met
Because she didn't have a top on (Top on)
I improvised a little bit
She said my references were spot on (Spot on)
"Can I take you for a drink?"
She said, "Oh God, I'll have to think
Because we're mates, it doesn't feel right" (Feel right)
And I said, "It's cool," and "I was messing," but it's true
Yeah, it's you, you're the one that makes me feel right

[Chorus]
I've been in love with her for ages
And I can't seem to get it right
I fell in love with her in stages
My whole life

[Verse 2]
I had a dream where we had kids
You would cook, I'd do the nappies (Nappies)
We went to Winter Wonderland
And it was shit, but we were happy (Happy)
I'm sorry that I'm kinda queer
It's not as weird as it appears
It's 'cause my body doesn't stop me (Stop me)
Oh, it's okay, lots of people think I'm gay
But we're friends, so it's cool, why would it not be? (Not be)

[Chorus]
I've been in love with her for ages
And I can't seem to get it right
I fell in love with her in stages
My whole life

[Bridge]
And there's been no way for me to say
That I felt a certain way
In stages, oh
I think the story needs more pages, yes

[Outro]
I've been in love with her for ages
(For ages) And ages
I've been in love with her for ages
(For ages) And ages
I've been in love with her for ages
For ages and ages
I've been in love with her for ages
For ages and ages, yeah
I've been in love with you for ages
For ages and ages, yeah
I've been in love with you for ages
For ages
I've been in love with you for ages
I can't be
What you want me to be, baby
I know what you
Want me to be
But I can't be

I am walking
By an empty filling station
I am looking in the middle
I am waiting

I can't be
What you want me to be, baby
I know what you
Want me to be
But I can't be

I am shaving
I am not so hairy, but I
Want to be as pretty as I
Know I can be

[Verse 1]
Follow me home if you dare to
I wouldn't know where to lead you
Should I take chances when no one took chances on me?
So I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start
With no beauty in my memory

[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

[Verse 2]
Perilous night, their voices calling
A flicker of light before the dawning
Out here, the wild ones are taming the fear within me
Scared to call them my friends and be broken again
Is this hope just a mystical dream?

[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

[Bridge]
And so maybe my home isn't what I had known
What I thought it would be
But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night
And I know that this life isn't safe, but it's wild and it's free

[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
I'll never wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
With them, I have something, something to cling to
I never knew I'd love this world they've let me into
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts

[Verse 1]
Don't say you love me 'cause I can't say it back
Don't say you're sorry 'cause you've done nothing bad
Swallow my feelings, but won't swallow my pride
You know I've got a suit of armor on, you'll never see me cry
I hate the silence (Ah-ah), that's why the music's always loud
So many problems (Ah-ah), I try to drown 'em out
1000 bottles (Ah-ah), collecting souvenirs
You know it's so hard to admit it
But the only good inside of me is you

[Pre-Chorus]
I take all of these blue and yellow pills
But nothing seems to last like you
You're chasing after something that you'll never catch
Woah

[Chorus]
Like a white Mercedes, always been running too fast
When your heart is breaking, you keep on taking me back
Hate myself, I really love you
Hurting you feels like I'm hurting as well
All I know is I don't deserve you

[Verse 2]
You're so forgiving, my friends think you're the best
From the beginning, your friends said it wouldn't last
But this connection, it's something they don't see
You know it's so hard to admit it
But the best damn part of me was always you

[Pre-Chorus]
I take all of these blue and yellow pills
But nothing seems to last like you
You're chasing after something that you'll never catch
Woah
You

[Bridge]
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love
Oh, your love

[Chorus]
Like a white Mercedes, always been running too fast
When your heart is breaking, you keep on taking me back
Hate myself, I really love you
Hurting you feels like I'm hurting as well
All I know is I don't deserve you

[Outro]
All I know is I don't deserve you
Like you
I take all of these blue and yellow pills
But nothing seems to last like you
You're chasing after something that you'll never catch
Woah

[Chorus]

I got, I got...
I got, I got...

[Verse]
I got cocaine in my conscience, got it from my father figure

[?] when they shot the nigga, I would've been non-existent
Running through my momma 

[?], probably made 'em fall in love
I really feel it all was meant, 'cause that's what I'm a product of
Shouldn't even be here, shit I ain't even asked for this
How can I fit in with y'all when y'all ain't taking half the risk?
I'm just on some savage shit, simple yet elaborate

[?] don't know love live here but a nigga still passionate, nah
For real I want all of my niggas to flourish
Trying to get all my niggas encouraged
I stand still and watch you 

[?] in the current with herb burning
Still urging working 

[?] fully furnished, I'm in it
Time is money baby, fully reserving my minutes
Real to the image 

[?] blemish
It get intense and yet I feel like this shit is a scrimmage
Sometimes I feel like one of the realest lil niggas invented

[Verse 2]
I'm still on fire with that warm up on, layup line God
Filet I'm saying displaying the shake is my side job
Like fuck playing it safe, I know this ain't my design
We on the corner staying like them niggas spinning the signs
But we don't need no intervention if that shit ain't divine
You wasn't in it with us nickel and dime, don't get intertwined
I'm real to the stitching bitch, my shit in a vine
Won't kick like Kobe still in his prime, you gotta dig it
All you niggas gotta defend it
Swimming-swimming off the block how I got it out of the trenches, ooh
This shit is 

[?] to keep a nigga smoking
Leave the future on repeat, pain run deeper than the ocean
I came up on the creep before you even get that notion
And it's faster than Tyreke the way I put that shit in motion
It's filthy with them kicks is stepping on rugs, clean thug jeans
I can feel it in my bloodstream

[Intro: Lil Rap]

Sippin on some sizzurp you need some Listerine up in yo cup
That ain't even the worst part I said let me try it out
Hopped up in the Chevy sittin heavy now we ridin out

[Intro: Madonna]
I'm waiting for you. I have always been waiting for you. I’m attracted to danger, I crave it. Don’t we all want what we know is not good for us, what we know might break us in the end? And yet, we fly towards it. Always wanting the thing we cannot have.”

[Verse 1: Madonna]
I'm tired of being far away from home
Far from what can help, far from where it's safe

Oh

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me, take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me, take what you want and go

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
I never needed anything from you
And all I ever asked was for the truth (All I ever asked was for)
You showed your tongue and it was forked in two
Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you (Almost believed you)
Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake
Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown
Like a plague, I was wasting away
Tryna find my way out, find my way out (Find my way out)

[Pre-Chorus 1: Post Malone]
And it finally came the day
I start giving my heart away
For Heaven's sake, my bones will break
But you'll never own my soul, no

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me, take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me, take what you want and go

[Verse 2: Ozzy Osbourne]
Nobody likes me, nobody wants me
Nobody cares at all
No more believing, no more deceiving
I found you out after all
Every time and time and time again
I walk a world that's open
And now, I can't get you out my head
You're just like a drug, just like a drug

[Pre-Chorus 2: Ozzy Osbourne]
And now finally came day
I stopped giving my heart away
For Heaven's sake, my bones will break
But you will never own my soul, oh

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne & Post Malone]
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me, take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me, take what you want and go

[Outro: Post Malone & Ozzy Osbourne]
Take it all away
Why don't you (Take what you want, take what you need)
Take what you need from me, yeah
(Take what you want) Why don't you (Take what you need)

[Verse 1]
Real friends, how many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
I don't wanna sus
I can't he wanna
I cannot blame you
I'll be to dangue
I got the thing too
Now doing your thing then
Hope you're doin' your thing, too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' at the communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
I'm just trying to find her, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn, I forgot to call her, shit, I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?
Uh

[Bridge]
Tell me you when 

[?] on the gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even 

[?] wanna make time
Even if you too busy just to make time

[Chorus]
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him

[Verse 2]
I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was
Couldn't tell you how old your son is
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg
Plus I already got one kid
Couldn't tell you 

[?] though
I just showed up for the duh duh
Maybe fifteen minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit?
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit
Cause everybody 

[?] in the building
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg, I ain't feelin' your energy

[Verse 3]
Real friends
How many of us? How many of us?
Oh, real friends to real friends
To the real end
To the real end
Til' the wheels don't spin
To the 3:00 a.m. - calling
How many?
Just to ask you a question just to see how you was feeling?
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, "What's up, fam? Hope you good"
You say, "I'm good, I'm great," the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family and immediate or extended
I got the 

[?] that be pretending
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga two-hundred-fifty-thousand just to get it from him
Real friends
Huh?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him

[Verse 1]
Something doesn't feel right
That's enough for one night
Hope y'all get home alright
There I go, blame it on the weather

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But hey, there's nothin' wrong
I'm only tired of all these voices
Always sayin' nothing lasts forever

[Chorus]
It might be time to face it
It ain't as fun as it used to be, no
You're goin' under
You ain't as young as you used to be
It might be time to face it
You ain't as cool as you used to be, no
You won't recover
You ain't as young as you used to be

[Post-Chorus]
It might be time to face it
It might be time to face it

[Verse 2]
I've been lost before
So tell me it's not over
'Cause I finally got somethin' goin'
And suddenly
All my friends are growin' up
And movin' on
I must be missin' somethin'

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I just wanna keep this dream alive for now
Don't they know nothin' lasts forever?

[Chorus]
It might be time to face it
Nobody knows what you've come here for, no
You're goin' under
They roll their eyes when you're at the door

[Post-Chorus]
It might be time
It might be time to face it (Yeah)
You may as well embrace it

[Bridge]
We promise to come visit (Yeah)
It might be time

[Chorus]
It might be time to face it (Yeah)
You ain't as fun as you used to be
You won't recover
You ain't as cool as you used to be

[Post-Chorus]
It might be time to face it
It might be time to face it

Catch me flexing on a bitch
Riding clean in the old school
Money out the ass so you know that I'm a young fool
Why you talk like that?
Cause I'm a cocaine 

[?] so I can flex like that
Fifteen on my neck
Seven five on my wrist
What you know bout Mr. 

[?] with this scale bitch
My trap on fire
My trap doin' numbers
The diamonds in my watch look like cucumbers
In the trap them bricks going for a cool 

[?]
Stealing bases like Sammy Sosa playing for the Cubs
I be hustling, I be working, I be trapping like a bitch
I guess that's why my swag so arrogant

[Hook]
I got twenty on my neck
Ten on my wrist
Five on my bitch
Nigga I'm Hood Rich
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch
I got twenty on my neck
Ten on my wrist
Five on my bitch
Nigga I'm Hood Rich
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch

[Verse 3]
See I'm a shiner, I'm a grinder, I be all of the above
And if you want it I can get it cause I be plugged with them drugs
I might be low but ain't not joke I keep the pistol by my side
It ain't no license 

[?] just the way I'm gon' ride
My money keep talking
I tell these niggas keep walking
In the trap I be postin' but in the club I be ballin'
My pockets is low
My niggas know what it is
I ain't coming to the trap until I catch me a lick
Stupid fruity swag
That's L.A. up on that shit
I be booming, I be bunking, yeah I stay up on that shit
God damn I'm getting money
Man I'm trapping like a fool
In the 

[?] posted up 

[?] without my tool
Two for five where I be
Niggas shine where I be
Zaytoven you a fool, damn you riding on that beat
Nigga know where I be, posted 

[?]
You can drive thru my trap nigga call my shit McDonalds

[Hook]
I got twenty on my neck
Ten on my wrist
Five on my bitch
Nigga I'm Hood Rich
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch
I got twenty on my neck
Ten on my wrist
Five on my bitch
Nigga I'm Hood Rich
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch

[Outro]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
They make me clean up my room
And put away my toys
When company comes
I can't make any noise, oo-ah, ah-ah, ah-oh
They say I must take a bath
But I've had one bedore
I'm just so upset
I can't take anymore
Don't they remember
All the heartache so deep
When somebody tells you
Its time now for sleep, oo-ah, ah-ah, ah-oh
Please let me stay up too late
I don't wanna go to bed
I'm not even tired
I just wanna play instead
Won't somebody listen
To these feelings of mine
Can't anyone hear me
Or do I have to whine
I don't want to clean up my room
Don't wanna put away my toys
When company comes
I prefer making noise
I don't want any bath
Oh, and I never did
It's a difficult world
When your only a kid
Thank you, Goodnight
So you had your chance to be my lover
And there's really something more undercover
And you know that ain't cool
So I said in an hour call your momma and tell her she better just come get you
Cause frankly, baby, you ain't worth the gas in my BMW
Thought our love was so strong
I guess I was dead wrong
But to look at it positively
Hey girl
At least you gave me another song about a horrible woman
And that's you, but its true
Forever you told me
I'm the only one who's in your heart
So beautiful how you whisper
We would never be apart
And now things are changing
I can see the way you look at me
The say the eyes are the windows to the soul
So I finally chose it just can't me

Why didn't I see you coming?

Now this a vision where you stood
And I would touch you if I could
But your lips keep sayin what your heart would never do
Someone tell me how can a girl as fine as you
Be so cold and treat me like you do?
I'm still lost in your every move
It's just too bad that you're no good

Go ahead and tell that you love me
I know that it's just not true, no
Gotta give it to you
You got me what the hell's a man to do
Seduction at its finest
Has stripped away all my dignity
So beautiful how you whisper
Nothing can come between you and me
No I never imagined myself in this state of mind
I'm stuck between a dream and a nightmare
Where the passion has driven me blind

Why didn't I see you coming?

Now this a vision where you stood
And I would touch you if I could
But your lips keep sayin what your heart would never do
Someone tell me how can a girl as fine as you
Be so cold and treat me like you do?
I'm still lost in your every move
It's just too bad that you're no good

Go ahead and tell that you love me
I know that it's just not true
Gotta give it to you
You got me what the hell's a man to do

Why didn't I see you coming?

Now this a vision where you stood
And I would touch you if I could
But your lips keep sayin what your heart would never do
Someone tell me how can a girl as fine as you
Be so cold and treat me like you do?
I'm still lost in your every move
It's just too bad that you're no good
Now this a vision where you stood
And I would touch you if I could
But your lips keep sayin what your heart would never do
Someone tell me how can a girl as fine as you
Be so cold and treat me like you do?
I'm still lost in your every move
It's just too bad that you're no good
It's just too bad that you're no good

Go ahead and tell that you love me
I know that it's just not true
Gotta give it to you
You got me what the hell's a man to do

Go ahead and tell that you love me
I know that it's just not true
Gotta give it to you
You got me what the hell's a man to do

Go ahead and tell that you love me
I know that it's just not true
Gotta give it to you
You got me what the hell's a man to do

Go ahead and tell that you love me
I know that it's just not true
Gotta give it to you
It's just too bad that you're no good
You got me what the hell's a man to do
A vision of you girl, across the room
A club full of people, all I see is you
You're making eyes
You realize that I'm watching you
It's so hard to believe that you're breakin' me from across the room

I've been trying to push up next to you all night
But I gotta wait for a moment, for me that's right
And I don't wanna sound like those other guys
But what if I never had another chance to, to tell you
Just how you make me feel
And I just wanna let you know
You're softly killing me, with just your mere words hello
This may sound a bit crazy but lately I just wanted you to know
You strangely seduce me with just the way you say hello
This may sound quite forward but honey is there somewhere we can go?

Normally I just can't believe
I don't act this wild
But there's something about the way you smile at me
Feel like a child
And when you said hi, I almost lost my mind from the sound of you
I can tell you're kind
You wanna go outta sight, but you don't wanna be rude
I've been trying to push up next to you all night
But I gotta wait for a moment, for me that's right
And I don't wanna sound like those other guys
But what if I never had another chance to, to tell you
Just how you make me feel
And I just wanna let you know
You're softly killing me, with just your mere words hello
This may sound a bit crazy but lately I just wanted you to know
You strangely seduce me with just the way you say hello
This may sound quite forward but honey is there somewhere we can go?

[Intro]
I pray the sky will break for me
Am I crazy?
I call and I believe we're free, darlin'

[Verse 1]
Ways of the world confusin' me
Wonder if Dorothy
Ever had a clue she'd be a murderer
Tryna to get from A to B
I know you heard of her, she is just like me
Tryna figure it out
Dyin' to figure it out

[Pre-Chorus]
"You should be grateful," they say
(Yeah) "You should be thankful," they say
You lookin' good, you lookin' slim
Time to get rid of your friends
(Yeah) Nigga, who are you?
I'm just tryna better my life, do you
Never knew a thing about me (Yeah), screw you
Know I keep a screw loose if you need it
Do you need?

[Chorus]
Freedom, freedom, I pray the sky will break for me (Ooh)
Am I crazy?
Freedom, freedom, I pray the sky will break for me
Am I crazy because I don't believe?
Is it cool to believe in you?
Is it cool to believe in me?
Is it cool to believe in you?
Is it cool to believe in me?
Is it cool to believe in you? (Is it cool?)
Is it cool to believe?

[Verse 2]
In the midnight
I wait for you to come here right now
You almost make it alright
You almost make it worthwhile
I let you in, bring my soul ("You should be grateful")
You think you know me ("You should be grateful," they say)
You think you own me ("You should be thankful," they say)
Please (You lookin' good, you lookin' slim, time to get rid of your friends)

[Pre-Chorus]
Nigga, who are you?
I'm just tryna better my life, do you
Never knew a thing about me, screw you
Know I keep a screw loose if you need it
Do you need?

[Chorus]
Freedom (Freedom), freedom (Freedom), I pray the sky (Ooh-ooh-ooh) will break for me
Am I crazy?
Freedom, freedom (Freedom), I pray the sky (Ooh-ooh-ooh) will break for me (Ooh)
Am I crazy because I don't believe? (Oh, believe)
Is it cool to believe in you?
Is it cool to believe in me?
Is it cool to believe in you?
Is it cool to believe in me?
Is it cool to believe in you? (Is it cool?)
Is it cool to believe?
Is it cool? Is it cool?

[Ambience]

[Verse]
Oh, I think I landed
In a world I hadn't seen
When I'm feeling ordinary
When I don't know what I mean
Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
For the thirst and for the hunger
Come the conference of birds

[Chorus]
Saying it's true, it's not what it seems
Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams
And you get a head, a head full of dreams
You can see the change you wanted
Be what you want to be
And you get a head, a head full of dreams
Into life, I’ve just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

[Bridge]
Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
When you got me open-handed
When you got me lost for words
I sing oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
A head full of dreams
A head full of dreams
Into life I’ve just been woken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

[Verse 1]
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

[Chorus]
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start

[Verse 2]
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

[Chorus]
Nobody said it was easy
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start

[Outro]
Oh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Aah-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Intro]
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo

[Verse 1]
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
And dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

[Interlude]
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo

[Verse 2]
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear, a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night, she'll close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly

[Chorus 1]
And dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
She'd dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
La-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
So lying underneath those stormy skies
She'd say, "Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I know the sun must set to rise"

[Chorus 2]
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh

[Guitar Solo + Vocalizations]

[Chorus 2]
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo

[Verse 1]
I've been reading books of old, the legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold, Hercules and his gifts
Spider-Man's control, and Batman with his fists
Now clearly, I don't see myself upon that list

[Pre-Chorus]
But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero, some fairy tale bliss
Just something I can turn to, somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

[Bridge]
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

[Chorus]
Oh, I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2]
I've been reading books of old, the legends and the myths
The testaments they told, the moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls a suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero, some fairy tale bliss
Just something I can turn to, somebody I can miss

[Chorus]
I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this

[Bridge]
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

[Pre-Chorus]
Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero, some fairy tale bliss
Just something I can turn to, somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this
I want something just like this
Sing

[Chorus]
Oh, I want something just like this
Something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this

[Intro]
Yeah, and we G.O.O.D
Keep talkin' about this shit but whatever
We can go back and forth all day
How much I feel, I live for your love
Live for your love
Live for your love
Live for your love

[Verse 1]

You know what
Yeezy back with Timbo, something gold and simple
Heart's all within through exactly what you sayin' for
If you got the info then go in and start the intro
If you got the synth though, then go and spark the indoor
Oh it's different, oh, that's a different kind of money
Pop them, make it somethin', act done, eh
Pop them, take it, all of the dineré
Popped on in the 747, bitch
Make your jet look like a fucking private
Ghosts under on it like it's fucking Yeezus
I make your jet look like a fucking Prius
Focus on the funnel, 'pon the fucking Yeezus
What the fuck they thought, that "Y'all can't fuck with Yeezus"
I'll make your private jet look like a Prius
Suck on some, I'll find out where the fucking weed is
How'd I get so many checks from Adidas?

[Chorus]

This Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it's gonna be together
This Christmas

Fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me

Presents and cards are here
My world is filled with cheer and you
This Christmas
And as I look around
Your eyes outshine the town they do
This Christmas

Fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me, yeah
Shake a hand, shake a hand now

Oh, fireside is blazing bright
Caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me, yeah

Shake a hand, shake a hand now
Oh, Merry Christmas now
Shake a hand, shake a hand now
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

Cream-colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things

Oh
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things

When the dog bites, when the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad
When the dog bites, when the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad

Don't feel so bad

[Verse 1: Kelly Clarkson & John Legend]
I really can't stay (Baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (But, I can call you a ride)
This evening has been (I'm so glad that you dropped in)
So very nice (Time spent with you is paradise)
My momma will start to worry (I'll call the car and tell him to hurry)
My daddy will be pacing the floor (Wait, what are you still livin' home for?)
So, really, I'd better scurry (Your driver, his name is Murray)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Oh, we're both adults, so who's keepin' score?)
What will my friends think? (I think they should rejoice)
If I have one more drink? (It's your body and your choice)
Ooh, you really know how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To cast a spell (One look at you and then I fell)
I ought to say, "No, no, no, sir" (Then you really ought to go, go, go)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (Well, Murray, he just pulled up outside)

[Chorus: Kelly Clarkson, John Legend & Both]
Oh, I really can't stay
(I understand, baby)
Baby, it's cold outside

[Verse 2: Kelly Clarkson, John Legend, Murray]
I simply should go (Text me when you get home)
Oh, I'm supposed to say no (Mm, I guess that's respectable)
This welcome has been (I've been lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (But you better go before it storms)
My sister will be suspicious (Well, gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Oh, he loves my music, baby, I'm sure)
My gossipy neighbor is vicious (I'm a genie, tell me what your wish is)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Oh, that's somethin' we should probably explore)
I've got to get home (Oh, baby, I'm well aware)
Say, lend me a coat (Oh, keep it girl, I don't care)
You've really been grand (I feel it when you touch my hands)
But don't you see? (I want you to stay, it's not up to me)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Well, they can talk, but what do they know?)
At least there will be plenty implied (Oh, let them mind their business and go-)
Uh, ma'am, I really can't stay
Murray just go on

[Chorus: Kelly Clarkson & Both]
It's cold, baby
It's cold, baby
But, ooh, I don't wanna go
It's cold outside
Ah
Magnolia trees at night
Sparkling bright
Fields of cotton look wintery white
When it's Christmas time
In New Orleans

A barefoot choir in prayer
Fills the air
Mississippi folks
Are gathering there
When it's Christmas time
In New Orleans

You'll see a dixieland Santa Claus
Leading the band
To a good old Creole beat
And golly what a spirit
You can only hear it
Down on Basin Street
Your cares will disappear
When you hear
Hallelujah St. Nicholas is here
When it's Christmas time
In New Orleans
Ah, you'll see
A dixieland Santa Claus
Leading the band
To a good old Creole beat
And golly what a spirit
You can only hear it
Down on Basin Street
Your cares will disappear
When you hear
Hallelujah old St. Nicholas is here
When it's Christmas time
In New Orleans

When it's Christmas time in
It's Christmas time in
Heey, feel so good in New Orleans
With this Christmas time in New Orleans

[Verse]
Uh
How you step in this shit with them little-ass chains and that-little ass shit?
My shit heavy, lil' bitch
Drunk as a bitch (Bitch) when I came in this shit (Shit)
I might Earl on my Sweatshirt (Sweat) like Thebe, lil' bitch
Straight off the rip, all my layers on drip (Drip)
See, my tailor's the shit, got me tailored like Swift (Swift)
Name on her lips (Lips) when I came out events
And got razors like barbers, don't play with them clips
Shirt collars like Carlton, I don't stay at the Ritz (The Ritz)
Fresh as a bitch so they named me the Prince (Named me the Prince)
Just had a date with this ratchet lil' bitch (Bitch)
And broke up with my chick, so I match with my friends
And she can't pronounce what's on my kicks
Engine loud, blame it on my kit
.40 with a lot of kick (Kick) on my hip (Hip)
Let it rip, on my mama, on my kid
At my performances I'm jumpin' on ya kids
Fuck a stage, I'm moshin' in the pit
Gun license, keep it on me, bitch
Had that shit before a learner's permit (Ooh)

[Outro]
Back in this bitch and I'm back in this bitch
And I'm back in this bitch and I'm back in this bitch
Back in this bitch and I'm back in this bitch
And I'm back in this bitch and I'm back in this bitch
Back in this bitch and I'm back in this bitch
And I'm back in this bitch and I'm back in this bitch
Back in this bitch and I'm back in this bitch
And I'm back in this bitch and I'm back in this bitch

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse]
Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you
My heart will be broken
Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

[Chorus]
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm
Mmmmmm
Intro:
Yo, turn the focus
Turn the focus
Turn the beat down a little bit

Verse 1:
Yeah im big Dre, big soulja
Pull up on your block with that big Glock
Niggas talkin down like young draco ain't hip-hop
Bitch i got that ak-47 in the drop top
I swear you make the wrong move make you top top
Nigga i dont pop locks
Nigga i be trapping in my hood
West side zone 1, whats hannennin
Make the wrong move nigga, you already know i shoot
Im young draco nigga in my lambo, bulletproof
I got a lamb, got a benz, got a new bad bitch
If you make the wrong move you get hit up with the stick
On my way to new york gotta do the breakfast club
If you try soulja boy you get shut the fuck up
I had the biggest comeback
They talkin bout tyga
I be smokin on dope
They know im on fire

[Verse 1]
I hate living by the hospital
The sirens go all night
I used to joke that if they woke you up
Somebody better be dying
Sick of the questions I keep asking you
They make you live in the past
But I can count on you to tell me the truth
When you've been drinking and you're wearing a mask

[Chorus]
Baby, it's Halloween
And we can be anything
Oh, come on, man
We can be anything

[Verse 2]
Always surprised by what I do for love
Some things I never expect
They killed a fan down by the stadium
Was only visiting, they beat him to death

[Chorus]
Baby, it's Halloween
And we can be anything
Oh, come on, man
We can be anything
Baby, it's Halloween
There's a last time for everything
Oh, come on, man
We can be anything

[Outro: Phoebe Bridgers & Conor Oberst, Phoebe Bridgers]
Whatever you want
I'll be whatever you want
Whatever you want
Be whatever you want
I'll be whatever you want
Whatever you want
I'll be whatever you want
Whatever you want
Whatever you want
Lost in a black hole
I don't have to feel alone
Wouldn't never leave, it was on
Wouldn't never leave, it was on
How you gonna wait for the down low
You wouldn't even know how to get a hold
You don't even know what a switch is
You don't even know where the lights flow

You don't even act like you know
How you gonna fake out this room
You don't even act like you know
How you gonna fake out this room

Wish you were the one lookin right through me
Till the young don't turn a territory
Waitin every second for the down low
Every single photo

Lost in a black hole
I don't have to feel alone
Wouldn't never leave, it was on
Wouldn't never leave, it was on
How you gonna wait for the down low
You wouldn't even know how to get a hold
You don't even know what a switch is
You don't even know where the lights flow
Wake up without a feeling
Now I don't know where to go
This is what I'm feeling
Someone is waiting for me

[Toro y Moi]
Man this vision got me startin up a biz
Why you think I got a space this big
Now I come off arrogant
Said too much like you my therapist

[Elijah Kessler]
Where the fuck you go I did your line
Boy I never said you could drive
Then you took the other keys to my ride

How I'm supposed to get there, do you not think I'm important (yeah)
Girl you is so important
I just had to go, I'll explain it right in the morning (yeah)

And if I could I would go to another planet
But I'm not coming back
Why the fuck you think I took my bag

I been in the same damn place I couldn't stand it
And if I could I would go to another planet

It's that gotta figure this out

It's gonn' be the longest night

Cuz I wanna make my mind feel like it did not have anything to feel
Wake up at 5am with the lights on every day

[Outro]
Tonight, tonight, listen, listen

[Chorus: Old Grape God]
I think I'm feeling anxious
'Cause I'm tapping into shit that's supposed to stay ancient
I think I'm feeling anxious
'Cause I be tapping into some shit that's supposed to, stay ancient

[Verse: Toro y Moi]
She claim that she want me

[Bridge: Toro y Moi]
Are you gonna let me work like a dog now?
Let me crawl first
Let me fall down
Let me get hurt

[Verse: Toro y Moi]
She told me she want me
She don't even know
I put it on ice
It got me some falls
I click it, I buy it
I ordered the roll
Shit's overpriced
You don't even know
So outdated (so outdated)
Man I hate it (Man I hate it)
Gotta upgrade it
Got the 4-5-6, and the 7
And the X overrated (far overrated)
And the ex still complaining (still complaining)
A stranger stranger stranger
Called about the way we dated
There’s no more gettin stoned (no)
Imma need you to come over (yeah)
There’s no more gettin stoned (no)
Imma need you to come over (yeah)
Mhm, mm (ooh)

Pretty damn sure speed limit's 45
Falling off the bridge like day and night
See you on the left with no headlight
Better put this thing into overdrive

I dont keep up with these charts no more
I dont keep up with these sites no more (ooh)
Too much smoke, too much smoke and its blowing (ooh)
I can't tell what's really going on
So outdated (so outdated)
Man I hate it (man I hate it)

Imma need you to come over (yeah)
I wonder if i should do something I care about
And I wondered if it's something that I think is right for me
And I wonder if it's something I wanted to do forever
What happens when, it's time to go?
I guess we'll never know
I'll take care of it while I can

Fashion over function, man this thing got a moonroof
Fancy buttons too, what does this one do, ooh
Who you think you are, what you think you do (yeah)
Time is woven into me, woven into you
Tie dye everything, maybe I'll seal it smooth
Rock and roll the earth, break a fucking tooth

[Bridge: Toro y Moi]
Darling you ain't no friend of mine (friend, mine)
You were the worst, stuck inside my eyes (my eyes)
You're the kind thats afraid to die (to die)
Another movie with a sequel, nice try (nice try)
JJ Abrams with the ARRI and the Zeiss (AYY!)
What you shooting, yeah you better zoom in tight (zoom in tight)
Way too fast in the 'rari, red light (red light)
Escalade with the space last night (woo)

[Chorus: Toro y Moi]
Got the fans, I don't need reviews
Got the bands, get my momma food
No romance, no romance on the pedestal
No romance, no romance on the pedestal

[Verse 2: Caleon Fox]
Do not fuck with me because I'm high
Big boi pimping with the spinners on my ride
Got no limits on the hub that I supply
You got some swagger man I might just save your life (save a life)
Surfs up, jumping jumping, nerfs up, hand outs
Reaching out, hand outs, don't know much about
Fuck clout, I got none of that, swag, none of that
Zip zip, I secure the bag, enough of that
Booming in the trap from my Cadillac (caddy)
Stupid, dumb, intelligent, you can say I'm catting (catting)
Hot mamas, in the best, looking happy
Zip zip, I secure the bag, zip stacking (stacking)
Stack it by the zip, stack it by the zip, stack it
Stack it by the zip, stack it by the zip, stack it

[Chorus]
Got the fans, I don't need reviews
Got the bands, get my momma food
No romance, no romance on the pedestal
No romance, no romance on the pedestal

Way too fast in the 'rari, red light (red light)
Escalade with the space last night (woo)
I (?) too stoned
To call you (on?) the phone (forget it)

Did I take out the trash?

I need to take out the trash
I need to throw away
Some stuff

[Verse 1: Old Grape God]
Gettin' buzzed with such and such
Smoke a blunt with such and such
Just got a such and such

[Chorus 1: Old Grape God]
Chill son, I feel like Gary Wilson
Mixed with Keri Hilson
And I don't want any feels, son
I know Wilson from Cast Away, Cast Away, Cast Away
Cast Away, Cast Away, Cast Away

[Refrain: Toro y Moi]
Every day I wake up and I don't even know what the time is
Even if it matters, I don't even know, 'cause I
Do it all, every day, all the time
Do it all, every day, all the time

[Chorus 2: Old Grape God]
I'm the only one to hear you when you try to holla
God, ain't that a shame
Ain't that a shame
Cast Away, Cast Away, Cast Away
Cast Away, Cast Away, Cast Away

[Verse 2: Toro y Moi]
If I were left to my own devices (Woo)
I don't know what I'd do, oh, ayy

[Refrain: Toro y Moi]
Every day I wake up and I don't even know what the time is
Even if it matters, I don't even know 'cause I
Do it all, every day, all the time
Do it all, every day, all the time (Ayy)

[Verse 3: Toro y Moi]
You are not, you are not, you are not the sun
Just blood and bones, just blood and bones (Ayy)
You are not, you are not, you are not the sun (You're not the sun)
Just blood and bones, blood and bones
I don't wanna 

[?] around it
Already up in the front seat
Been here since the last week
Copycatting everything
(Just blood and bones, just blood and bones, ayy)
(Just blood and bones, just blood and bones, ayy)

[Chorus 1: Old Grape God]
Chill son, I'm Gary Wilson
Mixed with Keri Hilson
And I don't want any feels, son

I'm the only one to hear you when you try to holla
God, ain't that a shame?
Ain't that a shame?
Cast Away, Cast Away, Cast Away
Cast Away, Cast Away, Cast Away
Got lost again
Around 25th
No one saw me go
Damn, I made it out
I did what I was supposed to
Mother nature couldn't tell
If this is all a lie, I don't care
Oh well

Bluish haze
In my face
Acid wash
Drip, drip, drip

[Verse 1]
Kill that bottle of gin, genocide
They say they fly, keep that pesticide
That 357 what I rest beside
Blow a little smoke, keep the rest aside
A O every day put the rest of the vowels aside
Pop a couple beans, look, that's a side
Besides, I don't fuck with other sides
Is they grass greener, is that a peace sign
Or two middle fingers, I can't decide
How the fame and the money both coincide
Loud, loud pipe humming, cut the engine homicide
Let the smoke subside, my pennies wise call it Pennywise

[Chorus]
Y'all float down here
Y'all float down here
Down here down here
Y'all float down here
Got gold down here
Got weed, got smoke down here
Got drink, got smoke down here
Got purp, got hoes down here

[Verse 2]
Do this yes I do, She playing my flute
Got bands yes I do, she french kiss it, parlez-vous
I do this yes I do, She playing my flute
Got bands yes I do, she french kiss it, parlez-vous, B.o.B
A O every day put the rest of the vowels aside
Pop a couple beans, look, that's a side
Besides, I don't fuck with other sides
Is they grass greener, is that a peace sign
Or two middle fingers
When I'm drinking, I'm usually thinking
When I'm thinking, I'm thinking Franklins
Rap god, Amen
Bust your noodle, everybody loves Raymond
Yes, we do
I do this yes I do, yes I do, she playing my flute
Got bands yes I do, she french kiss it, parlez-vous
Let the- let the smoke subside, my pennies wise call it Pennywise

[Chorus]
Y'all float down here
Y'all float down here
Down here down here
Y'all float down here
Got gold down here
Got weed got smoke down here
Got drink, got smoke down here
Got purp, got hoes down here, down here
Y'all float down here
Y'all float down here
Down here down here
Y'all float down here
Got gold down here
Got weed, got smoke down here
Got drink, got smoke down here
Got purp, got hoes down here, down

[Lyrics from snippet]

I'll go back to Florida
My white shirt is on ya
When you make me hot, it's like bein' in a heavenly hell (Hot)
I just want and hope you keep me like that forever
Keep me like that forever and ever, babe
And I gotta keep on dancin' on my own

[Verse 1]
Not a slumber
Another sleepless night
Not a rave that could make it right
I was taught how to misbehave
Now I’m caught on a different wave
Wake up on another day
Another suspect on another page
I was out of another smile
Put me down for a little while

[Chorus]
No matter what the people say
It’s still our world
I still wanna wake up
No matter what they take away
It’s still our world
I still wanna wake up

[Verse 2]
Eyes open to an open space
Not a trace of the human race
I can see for a million miles
City streets turn to green aisles
Eyes shut as I shut the page
I could see that there’s another way
Look beyond to the new smile
Lift me up for a little while

[Chorus]
No matter what they take away
It’s still our world
I still wanna wake up
No matter what the people say
It’s still our world
I still wanna wake up
I still wanna wake up

[Chorus: Nija]
Let me be the one that you never let go
Let me be the song that you play on your phone
Let me love you til' you're old, here's my hand for you to hold
Let me be the one
Baby, let me be the one

[Verse 1: Jason Derulo]
I'll give you the key to the Lambo (Skrrt, skrrt, yeah)
Take a drive, we could fly out to the beach in Cabo (Cabo, yeah, yeah)
Spend the night, catch a vibe
I put them diamonds around your neck (Oh)
I see it so clearly, so VVS (Yeah)
You ain't gon' want for nothing
Been down from the rip (Woo)

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Take me to church on Sunday
And fuck up the club on Monday
Just promise me that one day, you'll let me, let me, let me, in

[Chorus: Nija]
Let me be the one that you never let go
Let me be the song that you play on your phone
Let me love you til you're old, here's my hand for you to hold
Let me be the one
Baby, let me be the one

[Verse 2: Jason Derulo]
Nobody wanna vibe in the friend zone (No)
'Cause when it's rough
Baby, I'm the one that you can call on (Brrt, brrt)
First ring, I pick it up
You ain't never had another ting like this (Ting)
Blow a check, put that Patek on your wrist (Yeah)
You ain't gon' want for nothing
Been down from the rip

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Take me to church on Sunday
And fuck up the club on Monday
Just promise me that one day, you'll let me, let me, let me, in

[Chorus: Nija & Jason Derulo]
Let me be the one that you never let go (Never let go)
Let me be the song that you play on your phone
Let me love you til you're old, here's my hand for you to hold
Let me be the one
Baby, let me be the one

[Bridge: Jason Derulo]
Pray, and thank the lord, baby
I wanna tell you something
Real talk, baby
Hey, I won the lottery
With you, baby
Thinkin' 'bout the love I made to you, na na
And after, I just wanna lay with you, na na
Spending every night and day with you, na na
Baby, let me

[Chorus: Nika, Jason Derulo, Both]
Let me be the one that you never let go
Let me be the song that you play on your phone
Let me love you til you're old (Love you til you're old)
Here's my hand to hold (Hand to hold)
Let me be the one
Baby, let me be the one
Let me be the one that you'll never let go (Oh baby)
Let me be the song that you play on your phone
Let me love you till you're old
Here's my hand for you to hold
Let me be the one, baby
Let me be the one

My watch shinier than a mother f***er man

So I might as well look the part right
Plus I don’t want no girl stealin’ my shit
I don’t be around no thieves, but bitch see this shit she might get a idea in her head

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa ]
I can’t stay, I can’t stay, I can’t stay

Thinkin’ about all the paper that I’m gonna get
N****s keep hatin’ but to me it do not exist
Ain’t really stressin’ just want to get high with my chick
Call all my homeboys and tell ‘em to come to the crib
Break out the KK and roll up some joints with my n**s
Make me some music and then I go chill with my kid
Wake up tomorrow and do it all again
Money falllin’ in
Said she had a good time so she call again
Next time she gon’ bring all her friends
You ain’t gotta bring your own girl I got enough to share
Smell it all up on your clothes
Khalifa Kush in your hair
I brought a pound to smoke
Pass it around and choke
But I can’t stay for long baby I got to go
I brought a pound to smoke
Pass it around and choke
But I can’t stay for long baby I got to go

She ain’t know how to roll up but now she a pro

Khalifa get the weed on a plane or a boat
These n****s keep swernin’ in my lane but they don’t
Do the shit I can get the chance and they won’t
Money in my pants, leave a trail when I walk
Soon as they get the smell they can tell what I’m on
I brought a pound to smoke
Pass it around and choke
But I can’t stay for long baby I got to go
I brought a pound to smoke
Pass it around and choke
But I can’t stay for long baby I got to go

But they can’t do it like Cam
Runnin’ through them grams
‘Nother couple grand
Gotta work hard if you really want it
But they don’t understand
Got to stick to the plan
Got to take care of fam
Gotta do it when everything inside of you tells you that you can’t
Gotta go so hard, shine in the dark cause your future’s brighter man
I’ma grind until I reach the top
We stay hungry, no no, we won’t stop
Still remember all my n****s on the block
Pistolvania that’s where we come from

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
We paid for it
We paid for it
We ain’t never fallin’ off cause we was made for it
We paid for it

Jump out the plane, jump out the plane
And I got paid for it
Jump out the bed, jump out the bed
And I got paid for it
We paid for it
We paid for it
We ain’t never fallin’ off cause we was made for it

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
I remember when they used to hate on us
Now we see ‘em at every show

So to all my n****s, no forever

All I ever wanted was love
Hey yeah, hey yeah (Ooh-ooh)
Hey yeah, hey yeah (Ooh-ooh)
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah (Hey yeah, hey yeah)

[Chorus]
I want your stupid love, love
I want your stupid love, love
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
Now, it's time to free me from the shame
I gotta find that peace, is it too late or
Could this love protect me from the pain?
I would battle for you (Even if we break in two)

[Refrain]
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out (Look at me)
Get down, get down, get down, get down (Look at me)
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out
Look at me now

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause all I ever wanted was love
Hey yeah, hey yeah (Ooh-ooh)
Hey yeah, hey yeah (Ooh-ooh)
Hey yeah, hey yeah
All I ever wanted was love
Hey yeah, hey yeah (Ooh-ooh)
Hey yeah, hey yeah (Ooh-ooh)
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah (Hey yeah, hey yeah)

[Chorus]
I want your stupid love, love
I want your stupid love, love
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Bridge]
I don't need a reason (Oh)
Not sorry, I want your stupid love
I don't need a reason (Oh)
Not sorry, I want your stupid love
Hey yeah, hey yeah

[Chorus]
I want your stupid love, love (Oh, oh, woo)
We got a stupid love, love (Love, love, oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I want your stupid love, love
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I want your stupid love, love

[Verse 1]
Day off in Kyoto
Got bored at the temple
Looked around at the 7-Eleven
The band took the speed train
Went to the arcade
I wanted to go, but I didn't
You called me from a payphone
They still got payphones
It cost a dollar a minute
To tell me you're getting sober
And you wrote me a letter
But I don't have to read it

[Chorus]
I'm gonna kill you
If you don't beat me to it
Dreaming through Tokyo skies
I wanted to see the world
Then I flew over the ocean
And I changed my mind (Woo)

[Verse 2]
Sunset's been a freak show
On the weekend, so
I've been driving out to the suburbs
To park at the Goodwill
And stare at the chemtrails
With my little brother
He said you called on his birthday
You were off by like ten days
But you get a few points for tryin'
Remember getting the truck fixed
When you let us drive it
Twenty-five felt like flying

[Chorus]
I don't forgive you
But please don't hold me to it
Born under Scorpio skies
I wanted to see the world
Through your eyes until it happened
Then I changed my mind

[Outro]
Guess I lied
I'm a liar
Who lies
'Cause I'm a liar

[Verse 1]
No longer a danger to herself or others
She made up her mind and laced up her shoes
Yelled down the hall, but nobody answered
So she walked outside without an excuse

[Chorus]
She can do anything she wants to
She can do whatever she wants to do
She can go home, but she's not going to

[Verse 2]
So she picks a direction, it's ninety in Memphis
Turns up the music so thoughts don't intrude
Predictably winds up thinking of Elvis
And wonders if he believed songs could come true

[Chorus]
I'm asking for it if they do
Doesn't know what she wants or what she's gonna do
A rebel without a clue

[Bridge]
So we spent what was left of our serotonin
To chew on our cheeks and stare at the moon
Said she knows she lived through it to get to this moment
Ate a sleeve of saltines on my floor and I knew then

[Chorus]
I would do anything you want me to
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, I would do anything
Whatever you want me to do, I will do

[Outro]
Whatever she wants
Whatever she wants
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
I would do anything (Whatever you want)
I would do anything (Whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)

[Intro: Daz Dillinger & (Snoop Dogg)]
(Ugh) Ha-ha-ha, I'm serious, nigga
One of y'all niggas got some bad motherfuckin' breath
(Oh, man) Aye, baby, aye, baby, (shit) aye, baby
Get some bubblegum in this motherfucker or somethin'
Aye, nigga, get somethin' to eat, dog
Aye, nigga, study long, study wrong, nigga

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kind of hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky-ass shit, like, every single day
May I kick a little something for the G's
And make a few ends as I breach through?
Two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
‘Cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' till six in the mornin'
So what you wanna do?
Shit, I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (but what?) we don't love them hoes, yeah
So we gon' smoke a ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger & Lil David Ruffin, Snoop Dogg & Daz Dillinger]
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice,laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this type of shit happens all the time
You got to get yours but, fool, I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch)
80 degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, ‘cause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound
Feel the breeze beyotch, I'm just…

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Daz Dillinger]
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Later on that day, my homie Dr. Dre
Came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic
That made me choke; shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me; not with a cherry on top
‘Cause when I bust my nut I'm raising up off the cot
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you, hoes, I'm out the door, and I'll be...

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Daz Dillinger]
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, beyotch
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, beyotch
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

[Intro: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
Yeah, nigga, we're still fuckin' with you
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D.R.E
'99, nigga, guess who's back
Still, still doin' that shit, Andre?
Oh for sho'
Yeah
Check me out

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
‘Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How? Nigga, my last album was The Chronic
They wanna know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still puffin' my leaves, still fuck with the beats
Still not lovin' police (Uh-uh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (For sho')
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (For life)
Still the beats bang, still doin' my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed, still

[Hook: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doin' 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since "Turn Off the Lights" from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after mathematics
In the home of drive-by's and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I get skin, D.R.E

[Hook: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
It ain't nothin' but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're coolin' on the corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representin' for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king, but the ace is back
(So if you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre be the name, still runnin' the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't trippin', love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard
Barbeques every day, drivin' fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless (Still)

[Hook: Snoop Dogg (& Dr. Dre)]
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Right back up in your mothafuckin' ass
9-5 plus four pennies! Add that shit up
D.R.E. right back up on top of thangs
Smoke some with your Dogg
No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!
Some of that real sticky icky icky
Ooh wee! Put it in the air!
Boy, you's a fool, D-R
Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Kurupt]
La-da-da-da-dah
It's the motherfuckin' D-O-double-G (Snoop Dogg!)
La-da-da-da-dah
You know I'm mobbin' with the D-R-E, yeah, yeah, yeah
You know who's back up in this motherfucker
What? What? What? What?
So blaze the weed up then, blaze it up, blaze it up!
Just blaze that shit up, nigga! Yeah, 'sup, Snoop?

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Top Dogg, bite 'em all, nigga, burn the shit up
D-P-G-C, my nigga, turn that shit up
C-P-T, L-B-C, yeah, we hookin' back up
And when they bang this in the club, baby, you got to get up
Thug niggas, drug dealers, yeah, they givin' it up
Lowlife, yo' life, boy, we livin' it up
Takin' chances while we dancin' in the party for sure
Slipped my ho a forty-fo' when she got in the back do'
Bitches lookin' at me strange, but you know I don't care
Step up in this motherfucker just a-swangin' my hair
Bitch, quit talkin', Crip walk if you down with the set
Take a bullet with some dick and take this dope on this jet
Out of town, put it down for the Father of Rap
And if yo' ass get cracked, bitch, shut yo' trap
Come back, get back, that's the part of success
If you believe in the X, you'll be relievin' your stress

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre (Kurupt)]
La-da-da-da-dah
It's the motherfuckin' D-R-E (Dr. Dre, motherfucker!)
La-da-da-da-dah

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
You know I'm mobbin' with the D-O-double-G
Straight off the fuckin' streets of C-P-T
King of the beats, you ride to 'em in your Fleet (Fleetwood)
Or Coupe DeVille rollin' on dubs
How you feel? Whoopty whoop, nigga what?
Dre and Snoop chronic'd out in the 'llac
With D.O.C. in the back, sippin' on 'gnac (Yeah)
Clip in the strap, dippin' through hoods (What hood?)
Compton, Long Beach, Inglewood
South Central out to the West Side, it's California Love
This California bud got a nigga gang of pub
I'm on one, I might bail up in the Century Club
With my jeans on, and my team strong
Get my drink on and my smoke on
Then go home with somethin' to poke on ('Sup bitch?)
Loc, it's on for the two-triple-oh
Comin' real, it's the next episode

[Outro: Nate Dogg]
Hold up, hey
For my niggas who be thinkin' we soft, we don't play
We gonna rock it 'til the wheels fall off
Hold up, hey
For my niggas who be actin' too bold, take a seat
Hope you ready for the next episode
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Smoke weed every day

[Intro]
CDs ain't selling no more anyways, man
Look at SoundScan
I really don't think it matters if

[Hook]
Everything I do
Is number one, that makes you two
And that spells trouble for me and you
'Cause that's how beef starts between crews
And I don't mind if I debut
At number two, so why do you?
If we make money, then why can't you
Be satisfied with what you do?

[Verse]
It's like our legacy's pregnant, we're plantin' eggs every record
They're beggin' me to release a CD every other second
But don't expect it, 'cause every time I get hit with that question
I just deflect it, get Ca$his or 50's record and check it
And Buck is out
Like get these motherfuckers out 'fore I smack 'em
Plus T.I. just dropped an album now, go out and get that one
And I got a whole stable of artists who's able and fully capable
Of holdin' a label 'til I figure out when I'm ready to drop
Or maybe not, Shady, look how hot you were, on top
You were pop, you were so popular, now you're not
You're a washed up entrepreneur, how's it possible? Well, it's not
If your little fickle minds would've caught on, but you didn't
See, I don't rap for the green, I mean, I ain't greedy
But I also know what it's like to be needy
And I will never go back to poverty, see, it ain't easy
To try to step away from entertainment, separate it from CDs
And every day it just seems like we're beefin'
Even the media's meat eaters, they gotta give you something
To read or you won't buy it, believe what you wanna believe
Let 'em feed to you, the BS, P.S., peace to T.I., you gon be 'aight
And we out

[Hook]
Everything I do
Is number one, that makes you two
And that spells trouble for me and you
'Cause that's how beef starts between crews
And I don't mind if I debut
At number two, so why do you?
If we make money, then why can't you
Be satisfied with what you do?

[Outro]
Peace
Hold a head up, partner
You know how we do what we gonna do
When we do it and we don't give a fuck what you're doin'
We gon' touchdown, back up in the private charter plane
We gon' touchdown, you know we gon' get it crackin' man
We gon' touchdown, I told you ain't no way to keep 'em quiet
With T.I. and Shady, baby, they gon' make a bigger riot
When we touchdown

[Chorus: Bob Dylan]

Well, I went to sleep in Shreveport
Woke up in Abilene
Wonderin' why the hell I'm wanted
At some place half way in between
So I went to o' to El Paso
Stopped to get myself a map
Went the wrong way into Juarez
With Juanita on my lap

[Chorus: Johnny Cash & Bob Dylan]
Wanted man in Indiana

[Verse]
You like Amar'e Stoudemire with dreads
Bobbleheads, chatterboxes flappin' but I got a lot 'em fed
Common head cold-level, minor setbacks, minor threats
To blockin' it's kinda Steph, step back
Ya shit is not knockin' like the feds
Don't get your head cracked lackin' common sense
On a whim I felt it, in mi casa you don't got no wins
Just to match the losses I don't have in your gym
Opposites attract opulence, the mud wouldn't stick
The sun make it so my soul's crumblin'
They dug it when they was young
More than one hole in one with no mulligan
Sellin' kids culture with death, circlin' like carrion
The more the merrier, phone got you livin' vicarious
Ice melting 'cause it's so hot
The veil lifts, the pain salient
Niggas started choppin' at the road blocks
As far as tracks, we goin' off
Brought the stroganoff beef, holy war
You know it's not unique to your boy at all
It's comin' out the teeth
Streets flooded like the pants weren't touchin' the sneak
They rain dancin' on this, no, they stomp
On all accounts, paid the cost to see this far
I'm not on board with the board you try and lead me on
I'm pullin' strings, it's time to let me off
The cook'll singe you
Protect your neck and don't forget the heart
We upper echelon with it, that's what they're checkin' for
I'm getting fed a conch fritter
I'm duckin' when the quiver launch missiles in the dark
Miss me with the glib remarks, switch hitta
Keep the innings long, nigga

[Verse]
Double back when you got it made
Thirty racks and weed, no fat in the collard greens
Off top was me, no cap, I don't bottle things
Flashin' grandmama rings on her fingers and fondle the thing
Hollow with glee
Not ominous but James Harden D
Weak niggas guarding will peak
Followers just like me
I lost my phone and consequently
All the feelings I caught for my GF
My hands was on her wings
I took 'em off, had a story careen against the bars
My canteen was full of the poison I need
The trip as long as steep
My innocence was lost in the East
Amidst the thick exhaust
Ahki hit the horn, it beep
Mention my sentence is strong
We all that we need
But don't call me brother no more
I keep my sentences short
Stack Pendleton keep me warm in the winter
Ksubi's cuff done hit the floor
Doobie Brothers where the city morgue
Who would truly love a visit from us?
My soul and my heart
All in it, keep fishing
Gone, the macabre finish
And miss my Pop dukes, might just hit me
Depending how I play my cards
The wind whispered to me, "Ain't it hard?"
I wait to be the light shimmering from a star
Cognitive dissonance shattered and the necessary venom restored
As if it matters if you think it matters anymore
'Cause shit be happening with quick results
They couldn't fathom all the damage that had to get done
Piglets in a barrel we cookin' up
Don't get a sparrow, no harrowed runics in that there tomb
And a share of deadly flowers bloom
Holler rabidly, we stare at you
And say a prayer
Let's take it there like courier pigeon
50,000 roots, none of 'em rigid
Some of them wicked how they grew

[Intro]
Give it up, we—

[Verse]
Somebody tooted in the student commons
The bell rang
He went home then argued in the comments
I watched the doppler move
I watched a child get introduced to violence
I beat you to the point
My noose is golden
True and livin'
Lonesome
Pugilistic moments
Riveting
Come get to know me at my innermost
My family business anguished, now I need atonement
I set the goals
Half my wings is broken
I spread the other for my brodie OD
Tiptoeing too much love
My sister showed in a rut
We getting over sinning up
Living in the moment, you been corrupt
Have some ginabut
Since a jit I figured what's the use in giving up
I can't give enough
Shilajit in my sippy cup
Healing cuts
But willingly I'm refilling the pump
No concealing it
Enemy up in arms bearing snubs
They just freakin' see the cub
My memory really leaking blood
It's congealing, stuck
Pieces in slums
One
Peaking in the dust, weaving
I remember woods
I remember endo when he wasn't remembering much
I remember love
Healing the ruptures
Feeling rushed, grew up quick
Trip around the sun, this my 25th, give it up
Gin and rum
We wasn't supposed to be alive, no funny shit

[Outro]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Give it up

[Verse 1: Mavi]
Man
Lost my dawg to the staircase, took the highest spot on the podium
Ghostin' niggas, probably smokin' to the thought of knowin' us
They loss a part of growin' up
Spurned us, learned I had to keep a wedge to get out of the rough
Fuses clipped for nuisance, disrespect 'cause we carried enough
I promised I'd bury the grudge, preparing the carrion grub
Larry Oops, I was lost in the alley, in the air but not sunk
I spun 'til the lost of my grandmama buried the dunk
Send 'bout a prayer a month, through the above
Niggas moody but imbued with the funk
Better shit to do than play with food
The rhyming Rubik's for fun
But I do what I want, ayy
And I rue what it was later, a looter as such
Confusingly up with paper
I'm shootin' ones with the judge if he sentence my brother
Been with him, muzzled us from the cradle
So we goin' to the grave with this shit
If we join the second line
The ancestors'll hand us a drum to load the second time
Somethin' scary 'bout airin' out the shit I compressed
The fare gettin' fairer now, the cost is
An arm, leg, an arm, leg, and a head
In all bread, the conquest for text, I'm pawnin' the rest
My Bompton partner spawn when donning the red
I'm all on they neck 'til my car park is pardoning French
Spar with a few niggas, sparkin' at the larger percentage
What's alternate when the losses come as often as wins?
And imposter clique thick
Don't got a job, I only ball off pick-six
I'm fraught with friction, in July, we had shit lit as Christmas
Hollins been sensed niggas been lyin', but we ain't gon' mention
Boo hit the stu' and started sweating', told her this the kitchen
You knew the rules
And we knew how to shoot the loopholes, jugo, beaucoup loot
And my kin and 'nem got the cannon, you gon' juke or boogaloo?
I been spinnin' around the answer
Non-definitive, I just crammed it
Outward gifted, inward feel damned
I took my lumps, my bruises, grooves
What the fuck are you to do?

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Every time a nigga didn't spot me
I had to figure out my own thing
Now we at the precipice droppin'
Harry Potter with the Dub-D's
Magic hands, nigga, what cheese?
Had a chance, didn't crush me
We gon' get it by all means
Rest in peace to my Ras G
Raw Fruit in the box, seeds
Let go, then I got wings
I'm seein' red, I'ma charge
You seein' red 'cause you salty
I keep the tears out my mind reach
I put my fears in a box like a prayer that you won't read
Spirited Away the whole thing
Peerin' away, I won't leave
See you starin' into old beefs
Ticket booths where they told me
Thickest thorns on the roses
Pistons roarin' like I'm Rasheed
Pistons roarin' like I'm Ben Wallace
Pistons roarin' like Chauncey
Fill up somethin'  'cause I been drivin'
Every time a nigga didn't spot me
I had to figure out my own thing
Now we at the precipice droppin'

[Part I: TISK TISK]

[Intro]
Shit
Fuck, nigga
Promise I'll never forget
And I promise I knew what it is
When I knew you, you wasn't a snitch, snitch
Tisk-tisk, nigga, snitch
Shit
Fuck, nigga
Promise I'll never forget
And I promise I knew what it is
When I knew you, you wasn't a snitch
Tisk-tisk, nigga

[Part II: COOKIES]

[Chorus]
Run for your life
I took the cookies, put 'em to the side
Sunny day, but I'm cooking inside
Muddy path, but I'm taking my time

[Verse]
I need cash money, baby, we live
I remember they ain't save me a slot
Back up when niggas hit the jackpot
I got sense, I'm tryna get me some guap
I need the tint
Just like my daddy skin, dark
I see your nigga, too bad he a mark
I see real niggas just jab, they don't bark
I see you tryna rekindle the spark
Reelin' from loss, yeah
Inner remorse, divorce your spirit and corpse, corpse
I tell you I'm hearing it all
The wisdom that's in your remarks
The silliness in you, I mourn
The moments that's tender and soft
I'm in 'em, the memories got strong
But some of 'em lost
The silliness in you, I mourn
The moments that's tender and soft
I'm in 'em, the memories got strong
But some of 'em long gone

[Chorus]
Run for your life
I took the cookies, put 'em to the side
Sunny day, but I'm cooking inside
Muddy path, but I'm taking my time
Run for your, run for your life
I took the cookies, put 'em to the side
Sunny day, but I'm cooking inside
Muddy path, but I'm taking my time

[Intro]

[Verse 1]

[Spoken Word]
And I began to riot

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-uh
Bend we don't break, swing we don't miss
We just might be okay, the same voltage
Hold the charge like the phone lit
No regards for the bullshit
Who all in?
Who got the cards flipped?
Who on shit?
Who get the target split?
Who on your marksman's bad side?
Going at landmines, don't count steps
The old chest said "it's about time"
Slow breath, cold flesh made her mouth cry
We know death, alright let's go left
Hand signs, still with the bands like lead singers
Niggas remember them camp fires
I dip when they capsize
And swift hit the roads kickin' cans like chivalry dead
You really dead, but we still ahead
Couple clips left, couple lips cleft
Hammer and nail, Hommy and Earl
Spotting, got 'em from the top of the hill
Wrote it on the foggiest mirror
The quality thorough, ill
It's all I could spill
There's more I could do
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
So, so we, so we did it?
Yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Pray for the people
I make up the easel first, then paint what I see through
The maze, I'm an eagle, spend a day up at the creek
We got the same amount of heat too, but they not as regal
Crudités not gon' cut it, cut it slight
Braids brought out my eyes
I saw a light, I was nine
Told my nigga Miles we might gon' be aight
Guess I was right, twenty-five was a quarter to life
I'm on it, I strike, trials
Tricknolog' you fond of, I don't even like
The socialite reformed, alone every night
Post-performance, dizzy in the corner, boy, it wasn't nice
Learnin' how to get grimy
Pick a pole to grab and flip
Ho, we gon' shake something now
I got some time this year
I'ma go ten rounds and dip out, what time is it?
Mami Wata, shawty blew the fish out
Piscean just like my father, still got bones to pick out
For now let's salt the rims and pour a drink out
And sip (Mmh)

[Chorus]
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, it's all my fault
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, I know

[Verse 1]
Time moving slowly, I'm bouncing my head off the wall
I know nobody that knows where we're going at all
Don't, don't, don't, don't let me down
And I'll pick you up, I'll help you get around

[Chorus]
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, it's all my fault
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, I know

[Bridge]
I'll let it go
I'll cut the strings
Today I'm fine

[Verse 2]
I don't know where I've been lately, but I've been alright
I said good morning this morning and I'll say good night
Don't, don't, don't, don't wait around
We'll take the stairs that gets us into there
It's unfair when I'm being too proud, but

[Chorus]
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, it's all my fault
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, I know

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
I lost a friend today
Feel you gone, gone, you slipped away
Here you'll always stay with me
The moments shared, the memories as I dream
I look for you, I reminisce
These empty nights I call out to you, feelin' for you
Crazy love comes to an end
Another thought, a picture of you, dreamin' of you

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Blues away, way, way
I got two red pills to take the blues away
Blues away, way, way
I got two red pills to take the blues away

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
And I'ma fuck the pain away, and I know I'll be okay
They said our love is just a game, I don't care what they say
But I'ma drink the pain away, I'll be back to my old ways
And I got two red pills to take the blues away, oh

[Outro: Kid Cudi & The Weeknd]
Oh, oh, oh
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Someone to play catch with out in the backyard
To pick up the pieces of your first broken heart
Someone to say slow down when you turn sixteen
Yeah, I grew up without a dad, I'm gonna be the best one I can be

[Verse 2]
Someone to scare the monsters, when it's dark in your room
Someone to put their foot down when you want a tattoo
And not just say I love you, but show you what it means
Yeah, I grew up without a dad, I'm gonna be the best one I can be

[Chorus]
They say dads are supposed to shape you and in a way I guess mine did
I knew what I wouldn't do if I ever had a kid
They say history repeats itself
Well, I guess that's up to me
I grew up without a dad, I'm gonna be the best one I can be

[Verse 3]
Someone to let you fall down and teach you how to get back up
Teach you how to be sweet like mamma and how to be tough
Yeah, I'll never be perfect, but sure as those lines are pink
Yeah, I grew up without a dad, I'm gonna be the best one I can be

[Chorus]
They say dads are supposed to shape you and in a way I guess mine did
I knew what I wouldn't do if I ever had a kid
They say history repeats itself
Well, I guess that's up to me
I grew up without a dad, I'm gonna be the best one I can be

Yeah, I can't change the past, but the past has sure changed me
I grew up without a dad, I'm gonna be the best one I can be
I said I'm gonna be a dad and I'm gonna be the best one I can be

[Outro]
The best one I can be
Love you, baby girl

[Verse 1]
You are mine, I’ve been drowning in you
You fracture light again
Beautiful, please don't cry, I love you
When you leave, I cry on the inside

[Chorus]
I wake up, love you, so I love you, so I say I love you, love you, love you
Cry
I wake up, love you, love you, love you, love you
We're supposed to leave by half-past eight
You wait for a bit

[Verse 2]
Pissed again, I've been dying to meet you
You fracture light again (I love you)
I love you, oh, I love you
When you leave, I cry on the inside

[Chorus]
Oh, so I love this, I love you, so love you, love you, love you, love you
Cry
I will love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
We're supposed to leave by half-past eight
Will you stay or wait?

[Verse 1]
I think there's something you should know
I don't feel like myself, I'm not gonna lie (Lie)
How would you know? It doesn't show
I think there's something you should know (Know, know)
I think there's something you should know
I’m feeling like someone, like somebody else
I don’t feel myself, it could be my health
I'd like to meet myself and swap clothes
I think there's something you should know

[Refrain]
(I think there's something)
(I don't wanna be someone else)
(I don't wanna be someone else)
(I don't wanna be someone—)
(I don't wanna be someone else)

[Bridge]
You get a moment when you feel alright
You get a moment when you feel alright
You get a moment when you feel alright
You get a moment when you feel alright

[Verse 2]
I feel so seen and I can't dream
Sleeping terrifies me, otherwise, I'm fine
See-saw back and forth, back on the door, back on the floor
Oh, please ignore me, I'm just feeling sorry for myself
Feeling like someone, like somebody else, who don’t feel themself
Paying for their wealth with their mental health
I'd like to meet myself and swap clothes
I think there's someplace I should go
I think there's something you should know

[Outro]
I think there's something you should know
I think there's something you should know

Once this always fry up you the ones you got in mind
Nigga, I'm standing right here but I pretend like I don't hear them

[Verse 4: Skepta]
Yeah
Piece of paper in my mouth, let my demons out to play
Then I buried 'em in the dirt
'Cause they was standin' in my way
I wasn't welcome in the church
Someone that Jesus couldn't save
I'm the real livin' evil, I speak on the devil’s name

You want a timeless song, I wanna change the game

You wanna turn it up loud, Future Nostalgia is the name (Future nostalgia)

You want what now looks like, let me give you a taste

You can't get with this if you ain't built for this
You can't get with this if you ain't built for this
I can't build you up if you ain't tough enough
I can't teach a man how to wear his pants (Haha)

[Chorus]
I know you're dying trying to figure me out
My name's on the tip of your tongue, keep running your mouth
You want the recipe, but can't handle my sound

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? (Do tell, my love)
'Cause luckily, I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry

[Chorus]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Let me check my chest, my breath right quick (Ha)
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this (Ah)
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it bad
Take it, own it, steal it fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? (Hot)
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try (Yah, yah)
All of them bitches hating I have you with me
All of my niggas sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties

[Chorus]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with

Don't be scared, I ain't afraid
Just like that, come my way
That's my shit, that's my wave
Do it like that and I'll repay it
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid
Just like that, come my way (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Doja Cat]
I said, "Do that, do that, baby, all night long"
And I'ma turn off all my phones
You know I hate it when I'm left on read
But he make it all up in the bed
And he take me out, dinin' on nothin' but the best
He got Off-White on right, damn, he can dress
Makin' plans from the East, makin' bands in the West
Rockstar, Black Beatle type, bands on his bread
And baby, I want it, and I'll just be honest
'Cause I just can't front when I look at you
Just keep it one hundred, when I throw these hundreds
I hope that your ass gon' know what to do

[Chorus: Doja Cat & Gucci Mane]
Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-that's my shit, that's my wave
Do it like that and I'll repay it
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid

Do it like that and I'll repay it (Huh?)
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid (Wop)
Just like that, come my way

I'm not cheap, baby, and I'm sure not selfish (No)
Shakin' like Elvis, damn near broke my pelvis (Sheesh)
Jumpin' off the top rope, got 'em tag teamin' (Tag)
Putting on a show, I got the whole crowd screamin'
Bougie with the bread, I'll knock a top-notch freak (Freak)
Act like I'm a treat when a dog see me (Rr)
Like a thief in the night, just like she stole my green
Got me walkin' off the scene like a hole in my jeans (Damn, Gucci)

[Chorus: Doja Cat & Gucci Mane]
Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-that's my shit, that's my wave (Yeah)
Do it like that and I'll repay it (Huh?)
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid (Huh?)
Just like that, come my way (Burr)
That's my shit, that's my wave
Do it like that and I'll repay it
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid
Just like that, come my way

[Outro: Doja Cat]
Said I like it

[Chorus]
I wanna touch on you (On you)
You see me in my room (My room)
Wish you were here right now (Right now)
All of the things I'd do
I wanna get freaky on camera
I love when we get freaky on camera

[Verse 1]
We freak on the cam
Love at first sight, just a link to the 'Gram
Pussy all pink with a tan
And I play with it 'til my middle fingers are cramped up
Swipe right 'cause he thick and he handsome
Love a sneak peek, when you free? Can we cam up?
No shot to the screen, put your hands up
Make it pop in your face like a Samsung
And that's my nigga, better yet, that's my hitta
He don't leak nudes, and if you do you could go missin'
Met him on Tinder, he just swipe left on bitches
And he don't even scroll through Insta'
'Less he going through my pictures

[Chorus]
I wanna touch on you (On you)
You see me in my room (My room)
Wish you were here right now (Right now)
All of the things I'd do
I wanna get freaky on camera
I love when we get freaky on camera

[Post-Chorus]
Is you into that? (Into that, is you into that? Uh-uh)
Let's break the internet (Internet, on the internet, oh-oh)
We do it the best (It the best, doin' it the best, uh-uh)
When we have cybersex (Cybersex, havin' cybersex, oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
When he off work, he calling me on Skype (Yeah)
Trust me when I meet him, I'm fucking him on sight (Yeah)
Lemme see you beat it, I'm feelin' just like Mike (Okay, okay)
Huh, oh, surf that 'til I drown in all of your pics
Can't scroll down 'cause some of them dicks (Ya)
Think of my parents going through my shit (My shit, my shit)
Huh, oh, can't give head, you give me the FaceTime
Nigga, you a creep, I saw you on Dateline
You ain't gettin' pussy, you fucking an AI
Huh, oh, what a time to be alive
Living in the future, blinging on my hotline

[Chorus]
I wanna touch on you (On you)
You see me in my room (My room)
Wish you were here right now (Right now)
All of the things I'd do
I wanna get freaky on camera
I love when we get freaky on camera
I wanna touch on you (On you)
You see me in my room (My room)
Wish you were here right now (Right now)
All of the things I'd do
I wanna get freaky on camera
I love when we get freaky on camera

[Post-Chorus]
Is you into that? (Into that, is you into that? Uh-uh)

[Chorus]
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you

In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?

[Verse 1]
Baby, we tried to fight it
We all been there some days
Thought I needed something else
And acted like I was okay
We just had to work it out
And baby, I needed space
Ain't nobody 'round here on your level
You're so far away
You're pouring your heart out
I'm acting like I knew
You held me so down
So down I never grew, oh
I tried to find out
When none of them came through
And now I'm stuck in the middle
And baby had to pull me out, oh

[Chorus]
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Damn papa, you a rare breed, no comparing
And it's motherfuckin' scary
Tryna keep him 'cause I found him
Let a ho know I ain't motherfuckin' sharing
I could take you to the parents, then to Paris
Plan a motherfuckin' wedding
You the type I wanna marry (Yeah) and keep you merry
I'll put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight (Woo)
Like the birds of a feather, baby (Woo)
We real life made for each other (Woo)
And it's hard to keep my cool
When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you're a one in a million
There ain't no man like you

[Chorus]
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through

[Post-Chorus]
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?

You just gotta listen closely to me
I need you, me, us
Addicted, uh

[Chorus]
I am addicted, a little
Under the influence, a little
And it makes me want to dance, a little
An itch I just can't scratch, addiction

[Verse 1]
I got such a pretty body
Feels prettier when I'm a mess
And I just like to call him daddy
'Cause the first one had up and left
And you can relate to broken girls
I've been a day without it, I'm proud of myself
Baby, can you break the curse?
I'm so gone, I believe in magic
You can relate to broken girls
I've been a day without it, I'm proud of myself
Baby, can you break the curse?
I'm so gone, I believe in magic

[Chorus]
I am addicted, a little
Under the influence, a little
And it makes me want to dance, a little
An itch I just can't scratch, addiction

More, just a little bit more, just a little bit

[Verse 2]
Yeah, roll another hunnid
We could get the white girl lit like Madonna
Bitch, I ain't Gwen, but this shit is bananas
Sweating, make ya whole body drip like a sauna
Swim like your piranha, put M's in my water
I can't feel my lips, my limbs feel like rubber
Yeah, I came down, but I still need another
One under the tongue and then a little marijuana
They on the trees like koala

[Chorus]
I am addicted, a little
Under the influence, a little
And it makes me want to dance, a little
An itch I just can't scratch, addiction

[Post-Chorus]
Look

You gon' figure out you lost one and that's me (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Better than me
She ain't no queen, I'm like Houdini
Put a little magic in you like they can't see me
She so thicky in that polka-dotted bikini
Baby, why you frontin'? You know that I been the best

You so in denial lately, she just got you stressed
She got no finesse, she just get undressed
Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah)
Put the honey in the pot (Pot)
Put a nigga in his place
She just wanna take my spot
Woah (Woah), Woah (Woah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Better than me
Better than me

[Chorus]
Better than me
All of them bitches ain't better than me
I know you wanted somethin' else at your feet
You gon' figure out you lost one and that's me (Look)

[Verse 2]
I can do that too, bitch, I can do that too
I can get him juiced, I can make him screw, and
Trust me, he wake up right in the mornin', or like two, and
Just to get a smooch, and touch on that caboose, and
What they say about it? Oh, they say either you snoozin'
Honey, you just lose him, why the fuck he snoozin'?
Messin' with my man, shawty, you cruisin' for a bruisin'
Don't gotta be slimy, honey, swagger's what I'm oozin'
And they call her a trick because all she got is illusions
We walk in the room and compliment each other smoothly
'Member how I kissed you upside down like in that movie
Let God be the judge and we can get rid of these Judy's

[Pre-Chorus]
Better than me (Better than me)
Better than me (She ain't better than me, baby)

Come from wifey (Come from wifey)

[Outro]
You gon' figure out, baby
Careful who you fuckin' with, 'cause you just lost one
Just be careful who you fuckin' with, 'cause you just lost one

[Intro]
C'mon!

[Verse]
I still remember the Hip Hop Shop days
All I ever wanted was to get props, stop, raise
A couple eyebrows to send send shock-shockwaves
Through the underground, b-b-but not like this
This is when the shit g-g-g-got-got crazy
I was in the studio with the Doc-Doc Dre-zy
That's all I remember 'fore the shit got-got hazy
Then we made a song called "M-m-my Name Is" (Yeah)
And it skipped right over hip-hop, and the hip-hop stations
Top forty on radio, the kid got famous (Woo!)
He made it, but this was j-j-just not the way this
Was supposed to go, I'm afraid to say this, but–

[Verse]
I cut back on the syllables just a little, but still I feel I should
Kill a few just to show that still I do put forth an effort
One foot forward, thank heavens, and, good Lord
Whoever would've thought that my umbilical cord
Would've been c-cut-cut from the s-s-same cloth?
There's no other name, just be thankful that I came forth
Temper the same, whether it's boiled or flame broiled
You say my name, you bet that ass you gon' pay for it
Just the respect is not the crown that I came for
But if you feel like passin' it around, well then, Jay, throw it
'Cause we all go straight toward it, if not I just wait for it
The other skateboard, got a couple of scrapes forget about it
I'm stuck in this rut, but I'll get up out it
I always do, I ain't gon' sit here and argue about it
I can't hop out of that gutter, I just crawl through up out it
I'm back, I'm sorry, I feel awful about it

[Verse]
No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
You ain't stingy, split your tablets with me
You won't flinch when camera's flashing, flashing
Not fake laid back, no, it's natural
And I think you made for the life I lead
I'm not fake patient, I don't fake sick, huh
That kinda coffin don't need lean
Rest in peace
Got this lust for life in me, yeah
Horny for the game, uh
First they kiss, then they bite soft, uh
Then that bitch wanna play it off, huh
Fuck it, I'm pretty still in a pit of snakes
While serpents shake some brand new scales
I need a new face, I'm tired of these weirdos
Acting familiar, took all the rock
And turned it to pop, he think that he Elvis
And he ungrateful, they don't say thank you
They don't say grace, not even for meals, not even for millions
Fuck it, I'm pretty still, look at my deal
Richard Mille, look at my ears, flooded with diamonds
Look at my skills, running through blocks like 49ers
Forty-nine diamonds, stuffed in my bracelet
That cost a whop, that cost a whopper
And it ain't new, I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker
Pretty still, it ain't no pretty pill
It's either real or real
Real easy on the eyes, green like a soccer field
Skin hot when they tried me like them poppers feel
Hands shaking, norepinephrine levels skyrocket, fuel
Rocket

[Bridge]
Quit being violent with me (Yeah, why, why)
Quit being violent with me
Quit being violent with me
You make me violent

[Outro]
My room, my room, my room with me
Every night you were in my room
My room, my room with me
I guess I can't state my feelings too soon
I don't know you
And I can't put no threats in the air
Everybody’s talkin'
Like they got all the answers
Everybody seems
To have heard it all before

Well I don’t know
That I got anything new to tell them
Lord who’s gonna listen
To someone like me?

When I reach for the answer
Will the words come?
Will the truth be there
When I say that I believe?

And it’s no accident
You put me here
Though your message is sometimes so
Very hard to see

And I'm a broken vessel
I am the question in the mystery
They say that: "one day
All will be revealed"
Though I’m happy just
To wait and see
If you’re gonna send someone
Then, Lord, send me


Everyone seems
To know just what they’re doing
As all creation
Goes burning up in flames
Am I the only one
Who thinks that we all may be in trouble?
Is it I alone
Who thinks there must be some other way?
We’ve let the politicians and the rich rule for a while

Now let’s see what the
Lily of the valley has to say

And I am a broken vessel
I am the question in the mystery
They say that: "one day
All will be revealed"
Though I’m happy just
To wait and see

If you’re gonna send someone
Then, Lord, send me

[Verse 1]
You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinkin' of me
Somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
Things we said today

[Verse 2]
You say you'll be mine, girl
Till the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then I will remember
Things we said today

[Bridge]
While me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough

[Verse 3]
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all of the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then I will remember
Things we said today

[Bridge]
Well me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And though we may be blind
Love is here to stay but that's enough

[Verse 3]
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, little girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then I will remember
Things what we said today

[Outro]
Things what we said, things what we said
Things we said today
Oh things we said today, little girl
Things we said today

[Intro: Monty Python & Young Thug]
Some people say it's folly, but I'd rather have the lolly
With money, you can make a smash
There is nothing quite as wonderful as money, money, money, money
There is nothing like a newly minted pound
(Money, money, money, money)
Everyone must hanker for the butchness of a banker
It's accountancy that makes the world go 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round
You can keep your Marxist ways, for it's only just a phase
Money, money, money makes the world go 'round (Yee!)

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
Monte Carlo, big sharks on my ankles (Monte Carlo)

I go military boys with the angles (Gah-gah, phew-phew)
Gotta upgrade the stars outer space for me (Yeah)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Lotta blue cash in a rubber band (A lotta blue cash in the rubber)
Mount it up her ass, she in Barbie land (She in Barbie land)

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
Fresh to death, Gucci on my tomb
My chopper sing, it need autotune
Bad bitch in my hotel room
Take a perky right before we fuck, then act a fool
Sad money, I got blue face diamonds
I'm at the top and I'm gonna keep on climbin'
I got a gun on my hip, no silence
I want these niggas to hear the violence
Momma told me, "Don't trust nobody"
Damn, momma, you seen it coming
That's why I don't keep this heat for nothin'
Try me, then you're gettin' one
Plus one and a couple more, uh
30 shots when I am all done
Right, right? Did I do the math right?
Stomp 'em out, wrath in my Rafs, feel my wrath

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
Monte Carlo, big sharks on my ankles (Monte Carlo)

[Verse 1]
Don't say you love me 'cause I can't say it back
Don't say you're sorry 'cause you've done nothing bad
Swallow my feelings, but won't swallow my pride
You know I've got a suit of armor on, you'll never see me cry
I hate the silence (Ah-ah), that's why the music's always loud
So many problems (Ah-ah), I try to drown 'em out
1000 bottles (Ah-ah), collecting souvenirs
You know it's so hard to admit it
But the only good inside of me is you

[Pre-Chorus]
I take all of these blue and yellow pills
But nothing seems to last like you
You're chasing after something that you'll never catch
Woah

[Chorus]
Like a white Mercedes, always been running too fast
When your heart is breaking, you keep on taking me back

[Verse 2]
You're so forgiving (Ah-ah), my friends think you're the best
From the beginning (Ah-ah), your friends said it wouldn't last
But this connection (Ah-ah), it's something they don't see
You know it's so hard to admit it
But the best damn part of me was always you

[Pre-Chorus]
I take all of these blue and yellow pills
But nothing seems to last like you
You're chasing after something that you'll never catch
Woah

[Chorus]
Like a white Mercedes, always been running too fast
When your heart is breaking, you keep on taking me back
Hate myself, I really love you
Hurting you feels like I'm hurting as well
All I know is I don't deserve you

[Outro]
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love
One day I'll pull through and I'll be good enough
I don't deserve you (don't deserve you), I don't deserve your love
All I know is I don't deserve you

I cut back on the syllables just a little
But still I feel I should I kill a few
Just to show that still I do
Put forth an effort one foot forward thank heavens
And good lord whoever would've thought
That my umbilical cord would ever get cut cut
From the s-same cloth as no other name?
Just be thankful that I came forth
Tempered the same whether it's boiled or flame broiled
You say my name you bet that ass you gon' pay for it
Just the respect it's not the crown that I came for
But if you feel like passing it around well then Jay throw it
This way i'll go straight toward it if not I'll just wait for it
The other skateboard got a couple of scrapes
Forget about it i'm stuck in this rut
But I'll get up out it, I always do
I ain't gon' sit here and argue about it
I came up out that gutter, I just crawled through up out it
I'm back, I'm sorry, I feel awful about it
Yeah we got a situation
Locked down and we're trapped in the basement
I'm a victim of pro-placement
'Cause you act and sound level
Trying to pull across your statement
Oh
Because I know, you struggle
Choke when you see love grow

You, you lied, ha ha ha I was right
All alone, good job
Good job, you fucked it up

You, you lied
All alone
You, you lied
All alone
You, you lied
All alone
You, you lied
All alone
Because we used to be the cool kids
You were old school, I was on the new shit
We were addicted to the blueprint
But we threw it in the flame and now we're never gonna trace it
Oh
Because we used to be the cool kids
You were old school, I was on the new shit
We were addicted to the blueprint
But we threw it in the flame and now we're never gonna trace it
Oh
Because I know, you struggle
Choke when you see love grow

You, you lied, ha ha ha I was right
All alone, good job
Good job, you fucked it up

You, you lied
All alone
You, you lied
All alone
You, you lied
All alone
You, you lied
All alone
And now you're walking on your own
The rain falls down, I'm not answering my phone
I got to phase you out my zone
Hope you realize now that I'm never coming home
You were meant to be alone
You were meant to be alone
You were meant to be alone
You were meant to be alone

Because I know, you struggle
Choke when you see love grow

You were meant to be alone

Because I know, you struggle
Choke when you see love grow

You, you lied
All alone
You, you lied
All alone
You, you lied
All alone

All alone, good job
Good job, you fucked it up

It's the front
Good job, good job, you fucked it up
You were meant to be alone

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
You ain't stingy, split your tablets with me
You won't flinch when camera's flashing, flashing
Not fake laid back, no, it's natural
And I think you made for the life I lead
I'm not fake patient, I don't fake sick, huh
That kinda coffin don't need lean
Rest in peace
Got this lust for life in me, yeah
Horny for the game, uh
First they kiss, then they bite soft, uh
Then that bitch wanna play it off, huh
Fuck it, I'm pretty still in a pit of snakes
While serpents shake some brand new scales
I need a new face, I'm tired of these weirdos
Acting familiar, took all the rock
And turned it to pop, he think that he Elvis
And he ungrateful, they don't say thank you
They don't say grace, not even for meals, not even for millions
Fuck it, I'm pretty still, look at my deal
Richard Mille, look at my ears, flooded with diamonds
Look at my skills, running through blocks like 49ers
Forty-nine diamonds, stuffed in my bracelet
That cost a whop, that cost a whopper
And it ain't new, I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker
Pretty still, it ain't no pretty pill
It's either real or real
Real easy on the eyes, green like a soccer field
Skin hot when they tried me like them poppers feel
Hands shaking, norepinephrine levels skyrocket, fuel
Rocket

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Quit being violent with me
Quit being violent with me
Quit being violent with me
You make me violent

[Segue: Frank Ocean]
My room, my room, my room with me
Every night you were in my room
My room, my room with me
I guess I can't state my feelings too soon
I don't know you
And I can't put no threats in the air

[Verse 2: BennY RevivaL]
Uhh, uh, what
I gotta leave you be, every night you iggin' me
Boy, baby, get your life right, baby, message me
And I hit you back, fast, Mackin', like in Tennessee
Off in my room, doin' what I ain't supposed to be
Wet sheets my sex be, I speak so messy
Babe pass me that death tree and let me smoke please
At night you be in my room, don't care what city
You dyin' to catch my seed, take off and reunite
Don't freak like you desperate, shout out your exes
They dealt with your selfish type of aggression
I beat then I flexed it, that's my confession
I skeet just to exit off to your best friend
Don't take this hard, me pretty boy, how I exit
You dread a thought, I made your heart an investment
We creep 'cause you pressed it, that ass a weapon
No sleep on that bed spread, you get this message
Now go on

[Chorus: Lil Wil]

Its a Big E Beat

Soulja Boy off in this ho, Watch me hit my dougie bitch
Twenty thousand on my chain, Stacks on deck runnin this
Step up on da scene, Superclean with my soulja shades
I see a lotta haters, They must have sipped that haterade
Wipe me down clean as i’m rubbin on my head
Im fresh im fly, U heard what I said
Sod money gang money keep stackin
Earrings blingin’ Iced out platinum
The center of the floor, Gettin boogie wit my partner spain
I told him in 07, 2008 is over man
Haters in they mouth, Feel like he takin shots of novocaine
Im ridin thru da hood two fifteens in my Rover Range
Soulja Boy Tell Em, I Yuuuu on any ho
They call me S-Beezy, Watch me Yuuuu on any ho
And no u can't do it like me, Ho so dont do it like me

Walk up on the set (yup) steppin with a swag
Clothes gotta dro odor, so you know I blow bats (blunts)
Fresher then a mothafucker pocket got stacks
Hoes looking over here, cause they like Skeet Jack (pussy popping)
Chirper going off like I got a dispatch
They be looking for that work and I ain't about to holla back (nope)
Post up on the whip and start looking for something bad
Nice eyes, cute face, and gotta have a fat ass
Bust that pussy open then I tell her bring it back
Ima beast up in these sheets just like something you never had
Caught you at the club doing that sexy ass dance
Dropped it down to the floor and brought it back up in a stance (God damn)
I like the way she working it
Ass so fat and it's like magic when she twerkin it
Baby don't you jerk me, I know this here for certain
Cause it's guaranteed, you let me beat then I'll murk it

[Chorus: Lil Wil]

My dougie(x7)
She say she like
My dougie, I'm fresh

YEP!! flyer then a muthafucka

[Verse 3:Lil Wil]

Just got a fade dressed to impress
Born with a shoe fetish, so you know I stay fresh
I ain't worried about that mess, a couple grand up on my chest
Plus Drew just brought a tech and I stay fresher then some zest
Don't want my shoes to get no specs, Don't want no bitch to touch my neck
I'll tear this club up if I feel some disrespect
I just wanna fine chick, cause Lil' Wil just popped an X
And I don't wanna work hard cause I'm feenin for some sex
Do my dougie fresh and watch them hoes get to choosing
Middle of the club, jamming hard to my music
Bet you can't do me like a Triple X movie
Pull the dick up out ya pussy, let it slap ya on the booty
Going hard in the Jacuzzi, Oh my god I like her chewing it
Scars still persuing cause I gave that thing a bruising
Don't know what I'm doing better check me out fully
Mix that Dougie fresh with that Northside boogie

[Chorus: Lil Wil]
My dougie
She say she like
My dougie, I'm fresh
My dougie, I'm fresh
My dougie, I'm fresh
YEP!! flyer then a muthafucka, My dougie

[Verse 1: Jake]
I swear to God, I wasn't born to fight
Maybe just a little bit, enough to make me sick of it
But I-I-I-I can read between the lines
I want to run from everything
But my legs won’t work, it's clear to me

[Chorus: Jake]
I-I-I-I haven't been much myself
And I feel like my friends are being put through this hell I’m feeling
I think that I'm living, if you could call it living
So brash and unforgiving
Ruled by the vibe I'm bringing
Serving myself
Serving myself

[Verse 2: Jake]
The timing's poor I know it's never right
It's hard to see this time of night
Hard to know the reasons why I fucked it up again
Still, I breathe a sigh
It doesn't seem so lucky now
But, maybe I can figure out why-y-y-y

[Chorus: Jake & Nathan]
I haven't been much myself
And I feel like my friends are being put through this hell I’m feeling
I think that I’m living, if you could call it living
So brash and unforgiving
Ruled by the vibe I'm bringing
Serving myself
Serving myself

[Bridge: Jake]
Wait and see, I’ll be making my own way now
I'll be making my own way now, to where I got to be
Wait and see, I'll be making my own way now
I'll be making my own way now, to where I got to be

[Chorus]
I haven’t been much myself
And I feel like my friends are being put through this hell I'm feeling
I think that I'm living, if you could call it living
So brash and unforgiving
Ruled by the vibe I'm bringing
Serving myself
Serving myself

Yeah

So I feel the need to go and flex
But there's no tellin' how I'm comin' next
Niggas got me upset, yeah

Any nigga I can find, get the Tec (Brr)
I am not a rough, no, you take different steps there
I only smoke the loud, you be smokin' deaf
Tuxedo in a jet, double-R Saturdays
If you see what's on my neck
My shit lookin' like a treasure chest
VVS, yeah
Drop top, my Ferrari ceiling proof
Don't be hatin' if you know that you ain't bullet proof (Ooh)
Birds all in my home lookin' like a chicken coop
Shut the city down, take that bitch over from ten-to-two

[Chorus]
Ooh yeah
I be with two models

Time to hit my line

And tell me why the whack niggas always be the first in line
Girl, do you need for me to handle that for ya?

It's hump day, but I'm stayin' through the weekend

Baby girl, told me practice makes perfect

She told me she got a surprise waitin' for me before she let me eat it

[Chorus]
Shawty made me pop this pill
I told her I just wanna chill tonight
She told me, "Shut up, nigga, lay right here
And tell me when you start to feel the lights"

Told me to fuck her, but don't fuck up her high
Don't feel too great, now I feel it
How the fuck did we get naked? (Woo!)

[Verse 2]
(Shit)
Oh, I, got me too loud
We showin' out right now (Yeah, yeah)
Every little touch, yeah, the sex more better
Yeah, you geeked up, your love all turned up
Your body on fire
She said, "It ain't gon' stop for a couple hours"
Oh, my, my jaw gettin' tired (Slow up)
She told me I can't stop
I'm 'bout make her shower
Round one, ain't rush yet 'cause

[Chorus]
Shawty made me pop this pill (Oh, yes, she did)

Hold up, what did I take?
Need a bottle of water, I think
Lockjaw with the ugly face
Swimmin' on, on the ground
Percocet don't feel this way
Uh, right now, I can't feel my face
Is it X? Was it molly?
Is it the best? Oh, probably
It's the best pill that I ever had (Oh)
I swear to God

[Chorus]
Shawty made me pop this pill
I told her I just wanna chill tonight
She told me, "Shut up, nigga, lay right here
And tell me when you start to feel the lights"

Told me to fuck her, but don't fuck up her high
Don't feel too great, now I feel it
How the fuck did we get naked?

This is what it's all about, the fire is warm, the angels are singin'

Hey, hey, yeah, everyday, la-la-la
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
No matter the reason, no matter the season
My heart'll keep beatin', you better believe
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas (Like it's Christmas)
Everyday that I'm with you (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Everyday that I'm with you (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Everyday that I'm with you
Standby
Who's ready for a great show?
Let me hear you scream! (10)
Camilla Cabello's gonna be here! (Nine, eight)
Kendall Jenner, everybody! (Seven, six)
Zooey Deschanel is here! (Five, four)
Fred Armisen's here! (Three, facing camera two, two)
Lana Del Rey! (One)
And the star of the show, Kacey Musgraves! (Three, two, one, action)

[Intro: Kacey Musgraves & Camila Cabello]
Hey!
Oh, hey, Kacey!
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas to you!
Let's sing something
Let's do it!

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later, we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

[Bridge: Kacey Musgraves, Kacey Musgraves & Camila Cabello]
You will get a sentimental feelin' when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly"

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves, Kacey Musgraves & Camila Cabello]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
'Cause everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way
Woo!

[Bridge: Kacey Musgraves, Kacey Musgraves & Camila Cabello]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly"

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves, Kacey Musgraves & Camila Cabello]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
'Cause everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

[Outro: Kacey Musgraves, Kacey Musgraves & Camila Cabello]
Camila Cabello, everybody!
Merry Christmas!

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves, Lana Del Rey, Both]
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

[Bridge: Kacey Musgraves]
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves, Both]
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams
Mmm

[Outro: Kacey Musgraves, Lana Del Rey]
Lana Del Rey
Kacey Musgraves

[Dan Levy]
At Christmas, I no more desire a rose than wish a snow in May's new-fangled shows
That, of course, is William Shakespeare and I have absolutely no idea what it means
But that isn't the story we're here to tell
On this arguably festive winter's evening
Kacey Musgraves is getting ready for her favorite holiday
No, not President's Day, Christmas
Unfortunately, she and her band only just got home from tour
Which didn't leave her much time to prepare
Get an assistant, Kacey, am I right?
It is Christmas Eve, after all

[Kacey Musgraves]
Guys, has anybody seen that star ornament that my nana got me?
It goes on top of the tree
A star ornament?
Yeah (What's it look like?)
A star
I don't know
Okay, well if you see it, let me know
Because I gotta get ready for Christmas

[Dan Levy]
The band got concerned hearing this
For it was already Christmas Eve
A day being famous for being one day before Christmas
And, clearly, Kacey had a lot to do

[Kacey Musgraves]
Alright, yeah, I know I have a lot to do, but, I mean, is anyone gonna help me?
I made that banner
Oh, "Merry Christma—"
The printer ran out of ink
Who's that?
That might be one of your guests
Okay, but it's Christmas Eve and I thought people were gonna be coming tomorrow
Somebody called, said they couldn't do tomorrow, so I invited 'em
And did you let me know this?
I literally just did?
Alright, I'm coming

[Dan Levy]
Oh, wow, an unexpected duet!
Now with Leon out of her festively coiffed hair
Kacey and the band began to focus on a game plan

[Kacey Musgraves]
Alright, what am I going to need for Christmas tomorrow, besides alcohol?
Decorations? You don't really have any of those
What else?
Presents? Family?
Snacks, man
Yeah, snacks, where are all the snacks?
I have no snacks
You know, you didn’t have to host Christmas this year
I know, but I love Christmas
I mean, yeah, the planning is stressful
But, you know, when you get to sing or hear a Christmas song that you really love
There's no better feeling

[Dan Levy]
And so, even though Kacey had made virtually no progress with her Christmas preparations
She did, somehow, manage to find time for another song

[Skit: Kacey Musgraves & Fred Armisen]
Hey, Fred. What are you doing in here?
Hey, Kacey, I’m just (Hey) catching up on some reading. It’s so peaceful
Yeah, it really is. What are you reading?
It’s a book of Christmas carols
Cool. You got any faves?
I kinda do. This one
Oh, Silent Night
Yeah, it’s my favorite. I think it might be one of the most beautiful songs ever written
You know, we should just sing it together right now
Kacey, I can’t think of anything more wonderful

[Verse 1: Kacey Musgraves & Fred Armisen]
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
‘Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy infant so—

[Skit: Fred Armisen, Worker, & Kacey Musgraves]
Sir. Sir, sir. Sir. Mister, what are you doing?
Well, I’m just putting this painting up
Well, do you have to do it right now?
Well, I mean, it’s, it’s meant for this, uh, song thing you’re doing
Okay, well, I appreciate that, but don’t you think you should’ve done it before we started singing?
Well, yeah, I’m sorry. I was on another job. It ran over. (Okay, but)
Okay? So I’ve got to do it now. Alright?
Well, sir. Sir, sir. Stop! Stop it, please. We are in the middle of singing
It’s alright. I’m nearly done
So, sorry
It’s okay
I’m really sorry
It’s alright
One moment
He’s putting up the painting. Yeah
There, we, go!
Great. Awesome
Great. (Done!)
(Thank you) Please leave. Off, off you go
No problem. I’ve got plenty more to be getting through on my list anyway. Bye bye
Thank you
So, sorry
See you later, Kacey. Big fan of your work
Thanks
Do you know that guy?
Never seen him
Well, where were we, um
Um, Silent Night
Yes
Gorgeous song. Love it
Beautiful song
‘Kay
Here we go

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1: Kacey Musgraves & Fred Armisen, Both]
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
‘Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy infant so te—

[Skit: Fred Armisen, Worker, & Kacey Musgraves]
Hey! Hey! What the heck? What? Hey! Stop! Stop! What the hell are you doing?
Yeah, I’m sorry, it’s just that fixing this light is next on my list
I asked you to leave, okay? Are you kidding me? Can you choose another room to do this work in? (Yeah)
Yeah, no, fair point. Sorry ‘bout that. I’ll see what I can do. You carry on
Ye-ye-yes (Don’t mind me)
Kacey
Incredible
What? Can we just do it one more time, please?
Let’s do it one more time. (Okay) The most beautiful song ever written

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1: Kacey Musgraves & Fred Armisen, Both]
Silent night, holy night—

[Skit: Fred Armisen, Worker, & Kacey Musgraves]
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?
I’m sorry, i-i-it just turns out that all my jobs on my list are in this room
I-I-I, I’ll tell you what, I’ll try and do it quietly
Stop, stop. (It’s a— you—) Stop. Stop it!
You’re, you’re not even doing it more quietly. It’s just a little bit slower
It’s kinda, it’s worse
I want you to go, okay? Please go
Kacey, do you want me to go?
Yeah, I think, I think you should leave
See you later, Kacey
Bye
Alright, wonderful
Um, do you have time for just one more?
Should we do it?
Yeah. (Okay)
Is that cool?
I would love to
Alright, here we go
Yeah, okay
Okay
Here we go

[Verse 1: Kacey Musgraves & Fred Armisen, Both]
Silent night, holy night
All is calm—

[Skit: Fred Armisen, Worker, & Kacey Musgraves]
You know what? I think it’s quite enough for this song. We’ve done it, right?
Forget it, yeah
Great song
Thanks
Sir?

[Dan Levy & Kacey Musgraves]
And so, Kacey had an emo moment in her bedroom
Because sometimes, just sometimes
A great singing career, a bunch of GRAMMYs
And this over the top bathroom just aren't enough
Yet as Christmas Eve rolled on, would Kacey get ready in time?
Would she sing another holiday ditty that's overplayed in cafes and shopping mall restrooms?
And most importantly, would more celebrity friends continue to make surprise appearances that everyone sees coming but Kacey?
I don't know
Dan (Yes?)
Hey, what are you doing?
Oh, I'm just, um, I'm just freshening up in your bathroom
Look, if you could be just a little less negative when you narrate
That would be, that'd be nice
Wow, okay, um
It's Christmas, you know? We need Christmas cheer (Right)
Lots of cheer (Okay)
You know, happy...
You know, you're funny and that's kinda why we hired you, so, you know
So cheer then?
Cheer
For a corporate holiday in this political climate
Okay, sure, if cheer is what you want, Kacey
Then cheer is what you'll get
Thank you
Thank you
Right
Thank you so much, bye
Welcome back, friends!
Where was I? Oh right
It's Christmas Eve and Kacey still couldn't find her Nana's Christmas ornament

[Spoken: Dan, Kacey Musgraves, Band]
As the Christmas hour drew closer and closer
Kacey was feeling less and less relaxed
For it was too late to buy gifts for her band
Ugh, how did I forget to buy gifts for all the band?
You see, she had all year
I had all year
But the truth is, she just didn't know what to get those guys
I didn't know what to get those guys
And she'd been so busy
I've been so busy
Like super, super busy
They get it (Mmkay)
And to make matters worse, she'd just said all this out loud in front of the band themselves
Don't worry about it Kacey, we don't really need gifts
We do get paid and all
No, you guys do so much for me
I'm gonna figure this out, I promise
You know what? Maybe this'll help

[Verse 1]
You shake me up and turn me upside down
Just like a snow globe
And every time you touch me
I shiver right down to my toes
You got a strange effect on me
You know you make me feel so

[Chorus]
Glittery
You light me up like starlight on a Christmas tree
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart

[Verse 2]
Outside it's coming down
But here inside, it's warming up so
When you take your time
You turn me on and make my life glow
You got a strange effect on me
You make me feel so

[Chorus]
Glittery
You light me up like starlight on a Christmas tree
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart

[Bridge]
The winter is so gray, feels like the ice is here to stay
But when you look at me, you know you melt it all away

[Chorus]
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart
Oh, so glittery
I love the way you decorate my heart

[Spoken]
Hi Kacey, what's going on? Everything okay?
I guess
What's the matter?
I thought things were finally coming together
I'm just missing my family
Mm
Uh, it's not Christmas without going to Nana's house
Well, maybe this will make things better
I wanted to clear the air between us, so
I made you some Christmas cookies
You made these?
Yes
Processed in a factory
That's what I call my kitchen
Expired in 2017
I was looking out for your health
There's a price tag right-
Yeah, I would love to keep chatting about this but
I think there's more show to do
Yeah
And it could be time for another song

[Spoken: Kacey Musgraves & Troye Sivan]
Troye!
There you are Kacey
Thanks for coming!
Of course!
I got a brand new song, you wanna sing it?
Yeah
Alright

[Spoken]
Hey
You guys really haven't seen that star topper for the tree?
No. Have you checked the top of the tree?
Not helpful dude
Who could that be?
I don't think I even know any more duets

[Spoken: Kacey Musgraves & Nana]
Nana!
I thought you might like this
Where'd you find that?
You left it at my house last Christmas
Come here, come here, I missed you
I can't believe, what are you doing? Oh my-
Come here
I have so much to show you
I've been filming this amazing thing
You came all the way here from Texas?
I did
Yeah? How was the drive?

[Spoken: Narrator]
And so, as Kacey hugged her nana
Our age old tale of Christmas seemed to be coming to a close

[Spoken: Kacey Musgraves & Nana]
I love you
I love you more
Christmas is not Christmas without you, so thanks for coming
Thank you

[Spoken: Narrator]
The whole world is very, very sweet
So sweet, but this narrator has to leave

[Spoken: Kacey Musgraves & Narrator]
Whoa, uh, where are you going?
Sorry, I, I gotta run
Like, right now?
Yeah, um, seeing you with our nana
My nana
Sure
It just reminded me that
This isn't just some big corporate holiday, it's
It's also about being with the people you love
And getting gifts
So, I booked a flight home
Wow, uh, that's, that's really sweet
Thank you so much
Little unprofessional
Wow
But I get it
And the Christian half of me finally gets what this holiday's all about
You did it Kacey, look around
You made Christmas happen
Merry Christmas, Dan
Merry Christmas, Kacey
Also, taking a gift
Beautiful home
Love what you did with it

[Spoken]
Well, that was sweet
Almost as sweet as these cookies
After Kacey finished wrapping gifts, it was time for another duet
And great duets can't happen without great friends.​

[Spoken: Kacey Musgraves & Lana Del Rey]
I really, really appreciate you making the time to come here.​
Of course! I'm so happy to be here.​
Well, I would love to sing one of my favorite holiday classics with you.​
Yes! Let's do it.​
'Kay.​

[Verse]
Little things start to trouble me
Pressure me and bother me
This shit is stressing me
Especially the poverty
I always wondered what my destiny would offer me
My only guess would be, accessory to robbery

[Chorus]
There’s no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just "How far will this go?"
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up
But you just won’t listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can’t, can ya? Man, I can’t stand ya
You’re rotten, what you plottin’ for us?
Man, when are you gonna let up?
I guess things are gonna get much worse ‘fore they get better

[Verse 1]
Holy Toledo, it’s Angelina Jolie, amigo
She told me "Yo, Shady just hand your penis to me, I’ll deep throat,"
And Brad if you try to stand between us then we’re gonna see, bro
Who was a fantasy, I don’t mean to damage your ego
You faggots wanna 'rassle?
I shove a fucking jar of Vaseline up inside your asshole
And rope it shut with a lasso
Couple of crushed Lexapro broken up with the capsule or Paxil
Just in case I ain't dope enough with the raps, though
Coke is cut with tobacco, smoke it up, then go wacko
This is what happens when you mix a coconut with Tabasco
Shady let go, the ho has been choked enough, let her ass go
Not till Jessica Simpson lets go of the tuna casserole
'Cause I used to love her hooters now Carmen Elektra's cuter
Strap an extension cord to her arm and electrocute her
I’m off my fucking meds, but I’m on an electric scooter
I might just scoot by and shoot my mom in the neck with rugers
Spit in Jason's face while I vomit on Freddy Krueger
They can’t even get Jeffrey Dahmer to pet the cougar
Now I’m gone get the rectal thermometer, get the lubra-
Cation and get the patient some Darvocet to chew cause...

[Chorus]
There’s no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just "How far will this go?"
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up
But you just won’t listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can’t, can ya? Man, I can’t stand ya
You’re rotten, what you plottin’ for us?
Man, when are you gonna let up?
I guess things are gonna get much worse ‘fore they get better

[Verse 2]
I guess for him to stop is impossible
He just picked up another prostitute in the parking lot of the hospital
And beat her over the head mercilessly and left her for dead
He thought she was, 'cause otherwise he would never have left
Miraculously, she survived the attack
Even after his accuracy after he hacked the pussy with an axe
What are the odds that she'd be back?
He grabbed his encyclopedia off of the top of his fucking CD rack
Hit her with that then he threw her into the TV, ah!
I'm not playing, Rihanna, where'd you get the VD at?
Motherfuck the media! I'm reading ya something strictly from me to ya
Straight off the paper and this one's a freebie Jack
Let me add my two cents, of course I side with Chris Brown
I'd beat a bitch down too if she gave my dick an itch, now
It's just ridiculous how much this kind of sit-ow-
Ation can make her stink, how much gangster shit can he dish out?

[Chorus]
There’s no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just "How far will this go?"
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up
But you just won’t listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can’t, can ya? Man, I can’t stand ya
You’re rotten, what you plottin’ for us?
Man, when are you gonna let up?
I guess things are gonna get much worse ‘fore they get better

[Verse 3]
Oh my gosh, I put Natasha Bedingfield in a washer!
Watch it go from rinse to spin cycle
It's like I got ya hypnotized and I forgot ya
My God, ya psychologically fucked
Michael'd like an apology, what?
Tell that psycho to stick a Tyco truck and a white tricycle up his butt
And glue the seat of bicycle to his nuts
I’m as cold as a motherfucking icicle, I'm a nut
I ain't nuttin’ nice, man I like to pull knives and I like to cut
The poster addict for post-traumatic stress
I guess this is the most dramatic I’ve been in a while
This is the closest that it's come to the Marshall Mathers
I can hear him start to gather
I don’t paint the portrait of the picture perfect Partridge family
This ain't your orphan Annie, no this is more uncanny
Kick down Dakota Fanning's front door while the whore is tanning
(He can’t say whore!) Of course he can, man he just saw her fanny
Then murdered her while he danced around the room and wore her panties

[Chorus]
There’s no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just "How far will this go?"
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up
But you just won’t listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can’t, can ya? Man, I can’t stand ya
You’re rotten, what you plottin’ for us?
Man, when are you gonna let up?
I guess things are gonna get much worse ‘fore they get better

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
When you walk in the house, show me love (21)
It ain't even gotta be Valentine's Day
I'ma still leave some roses by the tub (On God)
Go through so much in the street
I just wanna come home to a meal and a hug (Straight up)
The opps wanna kill me, you wanna argue
I sleep in a trap and just thug (I swear)
But I'd rather you show me some love (21)
I'd rather you show me it's real (Real)
I'd rather you tell me your feelings
Than act like I'm trippin' and high on a pill (On God)
Don't say that you crazy in love with me
'Cause being crazy could lead you to kill (Fasho)
And money ain't nothing, there's people who happy in love
And behind on they bill (21)
And they haven't paid they mortgage in years (On God)
Let me help you fight your fears
Can't turn my back
When my grandma died, you helped me wipe my tears (21)
Coldhearted when I opened up
Man, your love, was that a bear? (Too late)
By the time you realized it was PTSD
You ain't even care (Damn, you ain't even care)

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Show me love
Treat it like we freakin' on the weekend, show me love
I heat up the seconds, times and reasons for your love
This is not the season for nobody else but us
I always get wrapped up in you, baby, I'm in love
We gon' get this love, yeah, like we never done it
Baby, I'm in love
Go 'head, show me love, like we never done it
Ooh, I got you runnin' every time I give you some
Show me love, love
Show me love, love

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys, Miguel & Both]
Show me love like you see red lights
And you crashed in it like a deer inside of headlights
Yeah, I show you love like it was passionate
I just wanna bask in it, winnin' it like a championship
You gon' show me love, like, like, you tried it (Yeah) and denied it (Yeah)
But you still let me apply it (Yeah) like I made you put your ties in
Show me lo-o-ove, even when you don't got time to
I'll be there to find ya, I'll remind ya

[Chorus: Alicia Keys, Miguel & Both]
Show me love
Treat it like we freakin' on the weekend, show me love
I heat up the seconds, times and reasons for your love
This is not the season for nobody else but us
I always get wrapped up in you, baby, I'm in love
We gon' get this love, yeah, like we never done it
Baby, I'm in love
Go 'head, show me love, like we never done it (Ooh)
Ooh, I got you runnin' every time I give you some
Show me love, love, love
Show me love, love, love

[Bridge: Alicia Keys, Miguel & Both]
Baby, you know what it is, yeah
You know what it is, yeah
You know what it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)  is, yeah (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
You know what it (Yeah-yeah-yeah) is, yeah (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
Baby, show me what it is
What it means to love (Yeah)

You gon' show what it is
What it means to love
What it is

[Chorus: Alicia Keys, Miguel & Both]
Show me love
Treat it like we freakin' on the weekend, show me love
I heat up the seconds, times and minutes for your love
This is not the season for nobody else but us
I always get wrapped up, baby, baby, I'm in love
We gon' get this love, yeah (We gon' get it, yeah)
Like we never done it (We never did it)
Baby, I'm in love (I'm in love)
Go 'head, show me love, like we never done it (Ooh)
Yeah, I got you runnin' every time I give you some
Yeah

[Intro]
One, two, one

[Verse 1]
As the winter winds litter London with lonely hearts
Oh, the warmth in your eyes swept me into your arms
Was it love or fear of the cold that led us through the night?
For every kiss, your beauty trumped my doubt

[Chorus]
And my head told my heart
"Let love grow"
But my heart told my head
"This time no
This time no"

[Verse 2]
We'll be washed and buried one day my girl
And the time we were given will be left for the world
The flesh that lived and loved will be eaten by plague
So let the memories be good for those who stay
Hey

[Chorus]
And my head told my heart
"Let love grow"
But my heart told my head
"This time no"
Yes, my heart told my head
"This time no
This time no"

[Bridge]
Oh, the shame that sent me off from the God that I once loved
Was the same that sent me into your arms
Oh, and Pestilence is won when you are lost and I am gone
And no hope, no hope will overcome
And if your strife strikes at your sleep
Remember spring swaps snow for leaves
You'll be happy and wholesome again
When the city clears and sun ascends
Yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And my head told my heart
"Let love grow"
But my heart told my head
"This time no"
And my head told my heart
"Let love grow"
But my heart told my head
"This time no
This time no"
Oh

[Verse 1]
How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
I struggle to find any truth in your lies
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
My weakness, I feel I must finally show

[Verse 2]
Lend me your hand and we'll conquer them all
But lend me your heart and I'll just let you fall
Lend me your eyes I can change what you see
But your soul you must keep, totally free

[Refrain]
Har har, har har
Har har, har har

[Chorus]
Awake my soul
Awake my soul

[Verse 3]
How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
I struggle to find any truth in your lies
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
My weakness, I feel I must finally show

[Refrain]
Har har, har har
Har har, har har

[Bridge]
In these bodies we will live
In these bodies we will die
Where you invest your love
You invest your life
In these bodies we will live
In these bodies we will die
And where you invest your love
You invest your life

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Yeah
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
For you were made to meet your maker
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
For you were made to meet your maker
You were made to meet your maker

[Outro]
Thank you very much London!

[Intro]
One, two, three, four!

[Verse 1]
Weep for yourself, my man
You'll never be what is in your heart
And weep Little Lion Man
You're not as brave as you were at the start
Rate yourself and rake yourself
Take all the courage you have left
And waste it on fixing all the problems
That you made in your own head

[Chorus]
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Tremble for yourself, my man
You know that you have seen this all before
And tremble Little Lion Man
You'll never settle any of your scores
Your grace is wasted in your face
Your boldness stands alone among the wreck
Now learn from your mother
Or else spend your days biting your own neck

[Chorus]
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my dear?

[Interlude]
Haa-a-a-a
Ha-a-a-a-a-a
Ha-a-a-a-a-a
Ha-a-a-a-a-a
Ha-a-a-a-a
Ha-a-a-a-a

[Chorus]
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my dear?

[Verse]
Dirt on your shoulders
I swear I remember when it changed
Don't you remember
I swear I can see it

[Pre Chorus]
You're there with your wide-eyed smile again
You'll be alright now
If you just let it go
Let it go

[Chorus]
I feel the weight around you breaking your bones
Let me make it better (Whoa)
Just settle down and let me carry you home
And let me ease the pressure (Oh)

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Pull all the blinds down
Just close both your eyes now
Yeah I'll stay
Turn all the lights out, I'll stay awake
And fight off the demons
'Cause you got a heart they'll never take
Yeah, it's alright now
You gotta let it go
Let it go

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
All summer we hung round'
On the streets of our hometown
Dreamed about us getting close
Dressing in your wedding clothes
All summer it went on
We got Kings of Leon on
Got me in a tripped-out haze
Busy hours turned into days, we were (oh)

[Chorus]
I got drunk but fell in love
Love is a lethal drug
I got drunk and took too much
Love is a lethal drug

[Verse 2]
All summer we belong to the way we let it on
Feeling slowly sinking in, lying back and watching heaven spin
In my head the parrot saw
Biomorphic thick in the stars
I don't know what else to win
Just give me one, give me one more hit (oh)

[Chorus]
I got drunk but fell in love
Love is a lethal drug
Fell down and picked it up
Love is a lethal star
I just can't give you up, but you're coursing through my blood
I just couldn't get enough, love is a lethal drug
Love is a lethal drug

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Just went up in smoke 

[?]
Are we in love with another dose?
I soar when my body floats
Love in a lethal dose
Love in a lethal dose, yeah
Love in a lethal dose

Everything around wanna move slow

Caught up in a vibe, I'm too gone
Any time I slide, the truth is
You just need to ride on me slow

Unzippin' the tight jeans and that feminine hygiene is magnificent
Tryna show you, girl, I'm different

'Til the pussy get too wet and it's drippin'
And splittin' both them legs like dividends
If it ends up how I want it, then you'll end up sittin' all over my bottom lip, baby
The feelin' of fuckin' you, feelings all up in you
Make it hard for you to bottle 'em, baby
This dick is too big just to swallow it, baby
But still you do it like it's Thanksgiving
And you gobblin', gobblin', gobblin', gobblin', baby
Like what's a goon to a goblin, baby?

And the way that she whip it, it's drivin' me crazy (Huh)
Think I've been hittin' the lottery, baby
Buy you a Wraith, I'ma give you my safe
Put you in apartments, you parkin' in places
Yeah, that's the real-life Monopoly, baby
We got all night to get it right, babe
So let me play
We got our whole damn life, baby
So here we are, all alone in this room
Girl, you know what I came to do

[Verse]
When this drink and this potion give me international high
Will you sit on my passenger side?
I don't want no one else, no one else
I don’t need nobody, kissed you in my lobby
I met you inside, just all in my lobby
Drink inside of my hand
Shame all in my game
I just know I can't
Reason why I just can't, you know why I can’t
And everything you do can't be the reason why
But I only want you for me, I'm selfish, babe
Thoughts of you block out my memory
Oh, and if I could I would, if I could help it
But I can't help it, no
Drop my pin, share location with nobody else but you, baby
You know I go loco in it, I know what you need
I promise that these promises'll be what you believe
You'll hear what you need, yeah

[Chorus]
I need way too much of you for me
And it makes me act superficial over you, oh
It's not you, it's just the things you do
Oh, yeah, yeah

It’s not you, it’s just the things you do

Oh, oh, oh, say it

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Got these bitches hatin' on you, but it don't offend you
You my number one, just know that you got no contenders
You keep that pussy so clean when I be goin' in
I'd spend my life in your box, don't need no codefendant
Go 'head, cut these niggas off like they have no existence
They can't go the distance, I'm oh-for-oh for instance
Fuck the gym, let me pull up and give that stroke of fitness
She a five-star shawty, still down to go for Denny's
Down to go for Wendy's
McDonald's chicken fries, thickest thighs
Seen it in her eyes, shawty know I know I seen her
Netflix and chill, and we can go to dinner
My schedule busy, but for you, girl, I'll make no agenda
You got no contenders
You kept it hot for me all in my cold Decembers
No pretendin'
Don't be trippin' on these niggas that you lovin' on
You gon' fuck 'em, treat 'em like you don't remember
Ooh, I need to have it 'til the day you gone
That's from January to December

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Whatever you want
More than happy to provide it
Wet like Poseidon
Whatever you want (Yeah)
Oh, shawty, don't you deny it
It feel like we flyin'
Whatever you want (You want, you want)
You know I can provide it

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Pullin' up to Story after Mr. Jones
Only thing I care about is who gon' get you home
My cigar full of this weed so I can switch the tone
We stumble to my house drunk, is anybody home?
Words slurrin' and my vision blown, different zone
Room spinnin', I don't know
Unzip my pants and get to blowin', you so nasty
Then what's up with me?
You stayed up tonight to fuck with me
Mmh, lucky me
Gucci panties, sit that pussy on some double G's
Fifty pairs of those'll only cost a couple G's, yeah
Just give me something to work with
Something with purpose
First time that we fucked, girl, you was nervous
Moanin' 'fore I even started touchin' the surface
Whatever you want

[Interlude: Ludacris]
Whatever you want, hah
Whatever you want if you that quiet, shit

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
She want it now and fast
Grabbin' and smackin' ass, make it last
Beat me to the finish, wave the checkered flag
Toe tag, left the pussy on a deathbed
Been milkin' the game since I was breastfed
Long enough to know that women with lisps give the best head
But not with braces
Your pussy talking's the only conversation, yap, yap
Grab her hair, pull her track back
Got somethin' to prove
Not from Houston but I got somethin' to screw at all times
She said it's all mine
All dimes, y'all fuck with nickels
I be in them guts, pokin' them sides until it tickles
Squeeze the Charmin on her soft ass
No, I don't pay 'em to come, I pay 'em to go, ho
No credit, all cash (Ching)
Be slidin' up and use a worthful transaction
And then just hop up off my dick with no attachments
Usin' prophylactics (Hah)
Safe to say this song is whatever you want
But it's limited to this penis and a blunt
Holler at me, Luda

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Whatever you want (You want)
More than happy to provide it
Wet like Poseidon
Whatever you want (Yeah)
Oh, shawty, don't you deny it
It feel like we flyin'
Whatever you want (Ooh, it's whatever you want)
You know I can provide it (I can provide it)
Ooh, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Ludacris & Sandy Coffee]
I'm 'bout to throw some game
They both one and the same
Cupid's the one to blame
Say it (Whatever you need)
I'm 'bout to shed some light
'Cause each and every night
You gotta do it right (Right)
(Whatever you want)
I'm 'bout to throw some game
They both one and the same
Cupid's the one to blame, say it

[Tory]
Aight, I'ma holler at you, yo

[Nyce]
Yo, what up?

[Tory]

Oh yeah
You sure, you sure Leah and Jalissa ain't friends?

[Tory]

They don't even fuck with each other like that
She was in the car talkin' 'bout it and shit

[Nyce]
Yeah, aight
Well, yo, look
Nigga, we was up in the barbershop the other day (Uh-huh)
Smokin' blunts, drinkin' liquor (Yeah)

[Nyce]
Well, yo, my mans was tellin' me, bro

[Woman]
Nyce, get off this damn phone (Fuck)
I told you I had to use the phone, you up here bumpin' your gums
Hang up this phone

[Nyce]
Ayy, yo, man, you know moms wildin' and shit
Man, you know what I'm sayin', it's all good (I know, I feel you)

[Tory]

She tryna lay him to the floor, I'm like, "Shorty you should go," but she like
I

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Shawty pulled up on me
Mmm, tell me what it’s gon' be
Car stopped, tank on E
She got me waitin', OD
When you walk inside the crib, keep your heels on
And come put that kitty cat on me
Oh, no, oh, yeah
You got a hold on me
Let’s talk about it, baby, I know you 'bout it, baby
I know you got a man, you know I got a lady
I know the thought of us fuckin', shawty, it's kinda crazy
Even the thought of me sayin' that shit is soundin' crazy
Ooh, back it up, let me smoke it, drag it up
You be wantin' me every time that I'm rollin’, actin’ up
Said I want you, girl, I want you, but I told you that enough
I done showed you that enough
No, this shit ain't addin’ up, oh, no, no
I love your girl, nigga
I keep it so thorough with her
I know that's your world, nigga

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
But every time you try to call her over there, lil' mama stay
She say, "Fuck that nigga"
When I put it in her rib, I say, "Is it his?"
She say, "Fuck that nigga"
Now, you keep it ice cold, you leave my nights froze
I know you don't love that nigga
Like you love me, ayy

[Verse 2: The-Dream]
But she won’t
I hope you got a side bitch, nigga
'Cause your main ain't comin' home
I got her in that zone, she out her thongs
And what this is? My nigga, I don't know
I bought her brand new heels so she could touch her toes
And her nigga hatin' like he was before
And she been here waitin' to fuck me to my song (Ooh, ayy)
I hate to see that look in your eyes (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
I, I hate to see that look in your eyes (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Bought her brand new heels so she could touch her toes (Ayy)
I can see it (Ayy)
I hate to see that look in your eyes

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
But every time you try to call her over there, lil' mama stay
She say, "Fuck that nigga" (She say, "that nigga")
When I put it in her rib, I say, "Is it his?"
She say, "Fuck that nigga" (Oh, she say, "Fuck that nigga")
Now, you keep it ice cold, you leave my nights froze
I know you don't love that nigga (You don't love, no, no, no, no)
Like you love me, ayy

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
You're young, you got options, it's reasons why you don't listen
You love takin' flights, hoppin' on 'em when your man's distant (Oh)
You made moves in your city and did not get no permission
You're not threatened by a good time whenever we're kissin' (Oh)
Stayed up late for it (Stayed up)
Waited up, stayed up, smeared up your makeup
Girl, I'll make up for it (For it)
That NBA nigga that you fuck is in town
And you're still down to break up for this
He ain't gon' like me after this one
Man, that nigga might wanna fight me after this one
He wifes you down
I won't even call you wifey after this one
'Cause I ain't gon' lie, you did him shiesty after this one
It was pricey after this one
Spent his credit cards on me, you hit the jeweler and made moves
You got me icey after this one
You was Leo status, couldn't call you Pisces after this one
You was nice before this but then got triflin' after this one
Hope you like me after this one
'Cause you're my—

[Part 2: Love Sounds]

[Part 1: Best of You]

[Intro: Mýa]
Even though I wanna see
How you put that thang on me
I can't let you, best of me
Lips are tellin' me yes, yes
Kissin' on my neck, neck
Should I stay? Should I go?
I don't know
Your hot boy style drivin' me wild

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
I chop trees in a wrap and get high
We go back like four flats on the ride
Put the Ds on the 'Lac when I slide
Baby, ooh, you got time for a youngin' like me
'Cause I flex, Amiri jean, white tee
And I know in the back of my mind
I'm way too wavy for you not to cosign
Wait, I got options on the phone
And wait, you done caught me all alone and playin' games
Ain't my style and you good at drivin' me wild

[Chorus: Mýa & Tory Lanez]
Lips are tellin' me yes (Yes)
Kissin' on my neck (My neck)
Should I stay? (Should I stay?)
Should I go? (Should I go?)
Lips are tellin' me yes (Yes)
Kissin' on my neck (My neck)
Should I stay? (Should I stay?)
Should I go? (Should I go?)

[Verse 2: Mýa]
Have you twisted like a rolled J
When you leave here lovin' my taste
If you get caught up in the flame
Just don't be actin' crazy
I won't play with your emotions
When I go in and I throw it back
I don't hold back
And I'm just sayin' them hoes can't handle
So what if we stay in the moment for too long?
'Cause really feelings be takin' over, way too strong
Ooh, if I hit it one time
Ooh, then it's gonna end up mine
And oh, if I get it twice, fuck around
Change your last name and your whole life

[Chorus: Mýa & Tory Lanez]
Lips are tellin' me yes (Yes)
Kissin' on my neck (My neck)
Should I stay? (Should I stay?)
Should I go? (Should I go?)
Lips are tellin' me yes
Kissin' on my neck
Should I stay?
Should I go?

[Outro: Mýa]
For you, you, you
You take it all, you take it all
Take it all, you take it all
For you, you, you
Oh, oh

You cheatin' me, I know you seen this shit from the start
Was lovin' you hard, I see the love come with scars

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
But I can hear your heart, it's crying out for me
And if it tears apart, take my worst flaws, that's on it
You should have never doubted

You should have never doubted
Now you can't live without me

[Verse 2: Mario & Tory Lanez]
Mario

Baby, don't make me wait for nothin'
'Cause, girl, I promise you gon' love it
When you wet, you can't say you don't want it (I got that pussy so wet, baby)
Every girl, that's a hit, I can have that (Have that)
But what's between me and you, we can't hide that (We can't hide that)
You too bad to be playin', this a hijack
'Cause I can, I can hear you callin'
I can hear your heart (Heart), it's crying out (Out)
I can hear your heart (Heart) and it's crying out
I can hear your heart (Heart) and it's crying out (Out)
It's crying out for me, yeah (Oh)
I know that sound is comin' from you (So let me hear you)
It's tryna tell me what to do (It's Mario)
I know that sound is comin' from you
It's tryna tell me what to do
But I can hear your—

[Chorus: Tory Lanez & Mario]
I can hear your heart (Oh yeah)
It's crying out for me (It's crying out for me)
And if it tears apart (Tears apart)

If you could do better (Never), you would do better (Never)
You know I'm sexy, intelligent or whatever (Intelligent or whatever)

[Break: Mario]
Whoa (Whoa)
Whoa (Whoa)
Why? (Why?)
Why?
Whoa (Whoa)
Whoa (Whoa)
Why?

[Verse 4: Tory Lanez]
You wanted new shoes and a Bimmer
Back in the day, we were the two that would team up
Martin and Gina
You know the truth, but you seen a few, how you doin'?
I see your point of view when I need to
I won't lose sleep over this, no
Got me jumpin' out the window, fourty-fifth floor
Moods that you get me, babe
Things that I did to you, this is you gettin' me back
And I need more to love you
I've been prayin' that some peace gonna come through
How you gon' be my enemy when I love you?
You know I need your energy when you come through
You knew I found love when I seen you
Seein' you was somethin' that I ain't never seen before
But I seen the beach shore, you was all aboard my marina
Demeanor, scale of one to ten, 15
Shawty got game, front row, full season
Fuck with a nigga head, no good reason
Dress real spiffy anytime, it's pool season
Shawty get a kick outta fuckin' 'em and leavin'
You want a nigga that  appreciate ya
Have him rollin', then you go and put your skates on

[Outro: Mario]
I love you more than he could ever love you
Appreciate a nigga make we wanna do somethin'
And every time I hear your heart
Girl, I'ma show you what you came back to me for

[Intro: Ashanti]
See, my days are cold without you (My days, yeah)
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you (No more)
See, my days are cold without you (Without you)
But I'm hurting while I'm with you (Without you)
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you (I keep on running)
Running, running back to you (I keep on running)
Running, running back to you (I keep on running)

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
You hurt me, you got me
Acting like I'm not me
I dig that, I'm big mad
The big bag, Versace
Oh, if you ain't love me like that
You wouldn't keep runnin' back
Oh, it's so hard to hold back
When you keep coming back, I'm glad, yeah
And when I need her back, I just put it on replay
Fly her to Miami, in the city where the Heat play
Had her in the sheets, finna cut her like a DJ
Fifteen bottles like a quince
She don't pay attention to that him say and she say
Said it two times, then I jinxed it
Saw right through me, had a cup full of lies as I drinked it, uh
Only gonna get it when she want it
New Givenchy, Birkin bag, girl, I was goin' in
Now you got some', baby, flaunt it
Wishin' I kept it honest

[Pre-Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Oh, you got some, oh, you got some
Oh, you got somebody
But you won't stop frontin', you won't stop frontin'
You won't stop frontin' on it, babe
Oh, you got some, oh, you got some
Oh, you got somebody
But you won't stop frontin', you won't stop frontin'
You won't stop frontin' on it, babe (Runnin' back to me)

[Chorus: Ashanti & Tory Lanez]
See, when I get the strength to leave (Runnin' back)
You, you can learn to appreciate me (Runnin' back to me)
Then it all remains the same (She runnin' back to me)
That you ain't never gonna change, never gonna change

[Verse 2: Ashanti]
You got me, I got you
You actin' out like you not you
The rumors, all not true (True)
You givin' away everything, I got you
Oh, Birkin bags and them tags won't get me back
I gave a fuck, you blow fifty stacks
You mad as fuck when I spit these facts
'Cause you can spend it ten ways (Ten ways)
Never cared about your money, regardless of what my friends say
'Cause there is nothing that they can say
Tory, if you really want it, you come Wednesday to Wednesday
Boss bitch whip, I pull up, cause a frenzy
No scratch on it, no Spud, no MacKenzie, uh
For all of my ladies, sing this song if you can't do wrong

[Pre-Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Oh, you got some, oh, you got some
Oh, you got somebody (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
But you won't stop frontin', you won't stop frontin'
You won't stop frontin' on it, babe (You won't stop frontin' on me, no)
Oh, you got some, oh, you got some (Swear that you got somebody, yeah)
Oh, you got somebody
But you won't stop frontin', you won't stop frontin' (You know you won't stop frontin')
You won't stop frontin' on it, babe (Runnin' back to me)

[Chorus: Ashanti & Tory Lanez]
See, when I get the strength to leave (Runnin' back)
You always tell me that you need me (Runnin' back to me)
And I'm weak 'cause I believe you (She runnin' back to me)
And I'm mad because I love you (Runnin' back to me)
So I stop and think that maybe (Runnin' back)
You can learn to appreciate me (Runnin' back to me)
Then it all remains the same (She runnin' back to me)
That you ain't never gonna change, never gonna change

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
Draft you to the team like Kobe in '96
Blue and orange drops like Ewing signed to the Knicks
You fine and you thick, get you assigned to the dick
Have you runnin' back and forth like suicides in this bitch
Do or dies in this bitch, like shoot from line in this bitch
I stunt so hard, I stuff credit cards in Goyards
Your face, no flaws, no case, no charge
Pulled up in BMs, we spendin' daily per diems
From AM to the PM, you would hop inside my bed
Get it wetter than, what's that line? Uh
Spray 'em where you see 'em
That's why I'm payin' no attention to chicks, I'm playin' in my DM
I know dropout Rovers, pop out sofas
Was with me when I wasn't eatin', we would pop out Stouffer's
You see, that's why I'm still fuckin' with you
Head down, ten toes, still thuggin' with you (Word)
Takin' long flights out to DR
I'm still in Palos, back to Caicos
Trips for the chick that swing them hips like Miss Juegos
From questions like, "How'd your day go?"
I spend it, extended the suite another week
In Dego, just to watch the day go
As far as bankroll, bank go
I can speak for it with the trips like sprain on ankle
I keep mami on everyone of 'em, shit, I'm sonnin' 'em
Niggas talkin' crazy to bae, I point the gun at 'em
Super hell shit pop up, dun-dun-dun at 'em
Was with me back when I was broke, and so I run it up
Anything for you, I swerve in the lane for you
Hop in the drop top, still work in the rain for you
Nurture this pain for you
'Cause even days that it ain't workin'
I'm still lurkin' and hurtin', in pain for you
See the art was I was shootin' from the heart
But what's shootin' from the heart with a worthless aim for you?
Yeah

[Intro: Lloyd]
Here (Ah)
She's fine too, but I want you (Ah)
Slowly, driftin' slowly
Yeah, if you could see the thoughts that's in my head

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Slowly, driftin' slowly (Slow)
Got my eyes spinnin' so slowly like the two hands in my Rollie
It's my time, come put that on me (Come put that on me)
You'll still be my one and only, or my lonely, or my doley
What's outside, and just don't OD on them girls that came before you
I won't OD on them guys that came before me, oh, I
Movin' lowkey (Movin' lowkey on—)
Beat that pussy like you owe me
Girl, you know me, and that's all me, oh, I
We both did thangs before, feelings and things involved
But I'm not to blame at all

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
These just ain't words (Words) that I'm spittin' (Yeah)
If you could see the thoughts (Ooh)
Thoughts that's in my, thoughts that's in my head (In my head)
These just ain't words (These ain't words), I feel a spark (Oh)
It's either that or I'm just caught up in my head (Ooh, in my head)
I can't help it (Can't help it)
All the ways you did your thing, that made me selfish (Oh, I)
These just ain't words, I'm addicted (Yeah)
If you could see what it's my head, I need you in my bed, oh

[Verse 2: Lloyd]
On my mind
Yeah, you been in my head, and I just don't know why
But since you left my bed, girl, my sun don't shine
I just haven't been myself, no, this ain't good for my health
So tell me, can you help it?
Baby, let's remind each other love is for us if we don't rewind
Let's keep movin' forward, leave the past behind
It don't matter who's before me, I know that you adore me

[Chorus: Tory Lanez & Lil Wayne]
These just ain't words (Word) that I'm spittin' (Yeah)
If you could see the thoughts (Ooh)
Thoughts that's in my, thoughts that's in my head (In my head)
These just ain't words (These ain't words), I feel a spark (Oh)
It's either that or I'm just caught up in my head (Ooh, in my head)
I can't help it (Can't help it)
All the ways you did your thing, that made me selfish (Oh, I)
These just ain't words (Yeah)
I'm addicted (Yeah, I'm addicted)
If you could see what it's my head, I need you in my bed, oh

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeah
And if I see you with that other nigga (Mmm)
I might spaz if I see you with that other bitch (Mmm)
I might dance if you see me with that other bitch (Damn)
You might harass, we can't be friends, I'm too far in (Yeah)
Open my mind (Yeah) and you walked in
I cannot be for real
When I went and copped the Richard
It was therapeutic, had to free my mind (Mind)
When I cut off all my bitches
It was only you I couldn't leave behind (Yeah)
Polly want a cracker, she said, "Please don't call me Polly"
She want me to call her bad words, these just ain't words
And you know I love you like good food
You know you're fuckin' with a good dude
You know you givin' me good brain
Like you graduated from a good school

[Chorus: Tory Lanez, Lil Wayne & Both]
These just ain't words (These just ain't words, words)
That I'm spittin' (That I'm spittin', yeah)
If you could see the thoughts (Ooh)
Thoughts that's in my, thoughts that's in my head (In my head)
These just ain't words (These just ain't words)
I feel a spark (Feel a spark, ooh)
It's either that or I'm just caught up in my head (Ooh, in my head)
I can't help it (Yeah)
All the ways you did your thing, that made me selfish (Yeah, oh, I)
These just ain't words (These just ain't words)
I'm addicted (I'm addicted, yeah)
If you could see what it's my head, I need you in my bed, oh

[Outro: Tory Lanez]
These just ain't words
Thoughts that's in my, thoughts that's in my head
These just ain't words
Caught up in my head
I can't help it
All the ways you did your thing, that made me selfish
These just ain't words, I'm addicted
If you could see what's in my head, I need you in my bed, oh

[Intro: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, uh
Lil Tory

She got that mean talk, that new Celine talk
She gotta jack that just like a beanstalk
She got that mean mug, she from the deep south
She know her contracts, she got that Steve Stoute
She throw that ass back, she got that clap clap
She make it tap tap, she make it wet wet
She make it walk walk, she make it wobbly wop
She like that top dropped, she like that talk when it's chopped
She got some bad friends, I'm tryna fuck her
I gotta spread them legs like it was mustard
I gotta put that thing on and have her flustered
I gotta play games in it, David and Busters
I like that look look, she got that good good

It make me gotta check to see if I'm still hood
I'm tryna tap that, she wanna act bad
Girl, let me Akon, come let me smack that

I got a bunch of credit cards, you can't max that

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Ayy, shake some, shawty, shake some, uh

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S
This got me thinkin' back, this got me singin' back
I got D'USSÉ in my cup, this got me drinkin' 'gnac
Tryna remember it all, put on my thinkin' cap
She had on checkerboard pants, think they was pink and black
I told my boy I'ma get her, bet you I link with that
We made a bet wit' our fingers, twisted our pinky back
She might've just been blinkin', that mean she winkin' back
She got a ass like a bar, could sit a drink on that
And I, and I, I gotta let you know
'Cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I can't let you go
And I, and I really just met you, yo
But I, but I see somethin' special though
Ayy, work somethin', can we work somethin' out?
'Cause I'm cashin' out if you're worth somethin'
Doubt, I'ma kill it, baby, bet I merk somethin'
Clout chaser hatin', they gon' make me hurt somethin'
They can't leave us alone, they either thieves or they clones
I got VVS stones, they look like TVs that's on
Won't get points off me, nigga, my defense is on
I can play man-to-man and I can even go zone, listen
Full court, I'ma press you if I like you, shawty
Bull shorts on a nigga like I'm Michael Jordan
Hook first time, Little Mo and Michael Shorey
Fuck it, do it for the second time like I'm Tory

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]

So, how you feelin', girl?

[Leah]
Honestly, I just don't know.
Like, I feel like we was just startin' to get a thing for each other.
I just wish I never did this shit.

[Keisha]
Yeah, I feel you, girl.
But that's what you get for fuckin' with Jalissa.

[Leah]
Sometimes I wish I never even met that girl.

[Keisha]
Mmm.

[Leah]
You know what the worst part about it is?
Just when we started gettin' good...
Hold on, girl, somebody at the door.

[Mailman]
I have a package for a, uh, Leah Watson.

[Keisha]
Ah, who's man-ass voice is that?

Oh, nobody, it's just a package.

[Verse 1]
Wild things you're doing at night
Trips to wherever feels right
Doing it all just to feel things
Drinking's enough of a vice
Drugs just aren't suiting you right
You were just fine as the real thing

[Chorus]
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're saying
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're saying
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me

[Post-Chorus]
What are you doing lately?
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're saying
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
You know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're saying
You know
That's not the way to get over me

[Verse 2]
I can't recover from all this conversation
You called me weak and you testing my manhood as we yell at each other
You wanted me to go and put my hands on you just to show you I love you
Just know I can jeopardize both our reputations
Despite what you said, despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
You acting out, you know you love to see a young nigga suffer

[Bridge]
You, you, you know, know, know
That's not the way to get over me
That's not the way to get over

[Refrain]
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're saying
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
You know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're saying
You know
That's not the way to get over me

[Intro]
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Yo, alright
Yo

[Verse]
I'm possessed by evil demons that torture me while I'm sleeping
I keep dreaming of death and I'm hearing people screaming
The Devil's spirit's trapped inside me and I want it out
I'm on the couch, bleeding to death in a haunted house
With both of my wrists slit, I'm lifted up in the air
And suspended in animation like someone's holding me there
I feel somebody's cold hands wrapping around my neck
While I choke on my own blood that I swallow and drown to death
But I found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches
Nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes
Tripping over OD'd bodies of dead lushes
Bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red slushes
Doors open and close by themselves, books fly off shelves
Curtains catch fire, the house melts
My skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters
The wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters
Caught a piece of shrapnel in the Adam's apple
Two cups of holy water and I'm looking at 'em half full
But as soon as I go to touch 'em they turn into red rum
It got silent, then all these voices said "Come
Follow me into the gates of Hell"
I heard 'em yell, "Welcome to the Norman Bates Motel!"
I ring the bell for service and I was greeted by his mother
Covered in dry blood, head still dented from the shovel
I said, "I need a room so I could try to get some rest"
She gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag of cess
And told me "That's just for starters"
Satan'll be in to see me later to see if I'm interested in being partners
This is the manifesto of Mother Monster:

On GOAT, a government owned territory in space, a birth of magnificent and magical proportions took place. But the birth was not finite, it was infinite. As the wombs numbered and the mitosis of the future began it was perceived that this infamous moment in life is not temporal, it is eternal. And thus began the beginning of the new race; a race within the race of humanity; a race which bears no prejudice, no judgment but boundless freedom. But on that same day as the eternal Mother hovered in the multiverse another, more terrifying, birth took place: the birth of evil

And as she, herself, split into two, rotating in agony between two ultimate forces, the pendulum of choice began its dance. It seems easy, you imagine, to gravitate, instantly and unwaveringly, towards good but she wondered, “How can I protect something so perfect without evil?”
What kind of girl is this? (What kind of girl is this?)
She's never ever been kissed (What kind of girl?)
Rubbidy rub dub dub (What kind of girl is this?)
She's never ever been in love (What kind of girl?)
She's never been in the moonlight
Watchin' the stars above, oh

Oh, tell me, what kind of girl is this? (What kind of girl is this?)
She's never been out on a date (What kind of girl?)
What kind of girl is this? (What kind of girl is this?)
She's never ever come home late  (What kind of girl?)
But I begged her on my knees to please go out with me
Oh and she did

Why did you love her? (No, no, no, no)
Why did you hug her? (No, no no no no)
Why did you kiss her? (No, no, no, no)
Why did you squeeze her? (No, no no no no)

Oh, what kind of girl is this?
Yes, yes, she's never ever been kissed
Oh, what kind of girl is this?
Oh, let me tell you, she's the kind you can't resist
But I love her, can't you see?
She's the kind of girl for me
Oh, my baby's so respectable (She's so respectable)
Oh, my baby's so respectable (She's so respectable)
Why did you love her? (No, no, no, no)
Why did you hug her? (No, no no no no)
Why did you kiss her? (No, no, no, no)
Why did you squeeze her? (No, no no no no)

Love her, can't you see? (She's so respectable)
I love her, can't you see? (She's so respectable)
I love her, can't you see?
She's the kind of girl for me
Oh, my baby's so respectable (She's so respectable)
She's got personality (She's so respectable)
My baby's so respectable (She's so respectable)
My baby's so respectable

[Verse]
So much has happened, think of what we've done
In the time that the Earth has traveled 'round the Sun
Winter, spring, summer, and we're back to fall
We've been together, hand-in-hand through it all

[Pre-Chorus]
From the minute we kissed and my heart skipped a beat
To the night that we danced, I was swept off my feet
Sure as every year has to come to an end
I'd go spinnin' 'round the Sun with you again and again
And again and again

[Chorus]
I think I kinda, you know
I think I kinda, you know
Like the way that we flow
Like the way that we go
And I love
I think I kinda, you know
I think I kinda, you know, you know, you know

[Outro]
I can't help dreamin' of you
Guess I'm sayin' I don't not love you
You know, you know, you know

[Verse]
Livin' in my own world, didn't understand
That anything can happen, when you take a chance
I never believed in, what I couldn't see
I never opened my heart, to all the possibilities, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that somethin' has changed
Never felt this way
And right here, tonight

[Chorus]
This could be the start of something new
It feels so right to be here with you, oh
And now, lookin' in your eyes
I feel in my heart (Feel in my heart)
The start of somethin' new

[Bridge]
I never knew that it could happen, 'til it happened to me
Oh, yeah
I didn't know it before, but now it's easy to see, oh

[Chorus]
It's the start of somethin' new
It feels so right to be here with you, oh
And now, lookin' in your eyes
I feel in my heart
The start of somethin' new

My body's craving, so feed the hungry

[Pre-Hook 1: Shakira]
I've been devoting myself to you
Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution
Or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused
Like a coffee machine in an office (Uh)
So I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover
And tell you about it

[Hook: Shakira]

Bronson do this
Bronson do that
Bronson too woke, and his pockets too fat

He always on the run, livin’ life like a movie
Ten roses is carved into the handle of the Uzi
Wit the black trench dragon
Doing donuts in the black Benz wagon

You know your boy is just a young hot hunk that got a keen eye for real estate
Side to side, switching lanes in the dealer plates

From New Jersey
Shoot the gun with curly hair, look Dominican in thirty years
Bitch

Young Baklava

I might fall out the Wrangler, but I’ll never fall in love with a stranger
Moonlight struck my face 9:30,  bye bye birdie
Young Bronson.   Motherfucka rappin like his tongue pierced, I wear 4XL in the Carhartt

[Verse 1]
Under the tree where the grass don't grow
We made a promise to never get old
We used to believe that the stars aligned
Together forever, but we ran out of time

[Pre-Chorus]
Heartache, heartbreak
It's taking its toll
Why won't you stay by my side, baby, don't go
I'm in pieces
Pick me up and put me together

[Chorus]
These are the days I've been waiting for
To hear you say you can't wait for more
Keep it coming 'cause we can't say no
These are the days worth dying for
These are the days worth dying for

These are the days I've been waiting for
To hear you say you can't wait for more
Keep it coming 'cause we can't say no
These are the days worth dying for
These are the days worth dying for
Lyrics From Snippet

[Spoken Word]
Two bananas for one dollar
One for sixty cent
You down ten if you don’t get the two
If you get the two, you save ten
You do that six times you got a whole new banana just for stayin' in business
But what if you only want one banana?
So you going to spend three bucks and that's only five bananas? Sh
Is you dumb? Sh
It's not even worth it dude
You ain’t never gonna catch me with a bana-

[Spoken Word]
If they're’s one thing I learned setting foot on the appalations all these years, tracking poles can be your best friends. If dad started using them the same age I did, his knees would still be out here with me. He fell off the back end of the Patty Wack Trail, broken femur and concussion. Rest his soul. It was a common cold that got him though

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 1]
Aching for a word and the words are not coming
I can paint it with a speech bubble, sing a motif
Rub it in on my teeth
Glisten white
Eyes shut
And my tongue's tied wrong
But I'm listening right

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, come on and get something
Onto my rung
Where the chords and the notes are the only thing sung
Come on and get something
Onto my rung
Keep the stereo on

[Chorus]
Everything else has gone wrong
Everything else has gone wrong
Everything else has gone wrong
Everything else has gone wrong

[Verse 2]
Aching for a word
I can feel my mind running
I can chase it till I'm seeing blood
Dark red coat on the side of my throat
When you heard each sound
Did you swallow it down, tasting every word?

[Pre-Chorus]
Then come on and get something
Onto my rung
Where the chords and the notes are the only thing sung
Come on and get something
Onto my rung
Keep the stereo on

[Chorus]
Everything else has gone wrong
Everything else has gone wrong
Everything else has gone wrong
Everything else has gone wrong
Everything else has gone wrong
Everything else has gone wrong
Everything else has gone wrong
Everything else has gone wrong
Everything else has gone wrong

And yes, I found my second wind
And yes, I found my second wind
And yes, I found my second wind
And yes, I found my second wind
And yes, I found some hope again
And yes, I found my peace again
And yes, I found my second wind

[Verse]
Get up, get up
To find out if they wanted
To find you
You'll cry out, you don't want to
But you do
But you do

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse]
Get up, get up
To find out if they wanted
To find you
You'll cry out, you don't want to
But you do
But you do

[Chorus]
Is it real?
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Is it real?
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

[Verse 1]
Is it real? I wanna go back
Times have all changed and I don't want that
'Cause I feel our lives roll past
Look the wrong way when I'm moving too fast

[Verse 2]
Is it real? Wind the tape back
Watch the whole reel 'til the picture goes black
Dig your heels, feel the roots crack
Rings in your center, but I wouldn't count that

[Pre-Chorus]
Rise and fall
In vain, in vain
Time and time
Again, again

[Chorus]
Is it real?
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Is it real?
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

[Verse 3]
Dig your heels, don't wanna go back
Times have all changed and I don't want that
As I feel our lives roll past
Look the wrong way and I move too fast

[Outro]
There, you see me go out the picture
There, you see me go out the door
There, you see me go out the picture
There, you see me go out the door (Is it real?)
There, you see me go out the picture
There, you see me go out the door (Is it real?)
There, you see me go out the picture
There, you see me go out the door

[Verse 1]
When I turn out, not a word out
It's my reality
Then I curl up, it won't take much
To stand in front and see

[Chorus]
I got that ego, what do I know?
It don't mean much to me
Fall away now, on my way down
It's all I know and I can hardly speak

[Verse 2]
There's a lighthouse, I can hide out
Staring out to sea
Shine a word through, did it reach you?
Or echo back to me?

[Chorus]
I got that ego, what do I know?
When I can hardly see
Fall away now, on my way down
It's all I know and I can hardly speak

[Post-Chorus]
A picture on the wall looking back at me
And I can't even talk
I'm floating in a dream
(I'm floating in a dream)

[Bridge]
You say I've a bent tooth
Well, I don't even like you
Want me to leave my cocoon
Where does that leave you?
You say you can see my bones
But I can see right through you
Too many faces to please
I can't see a place for me

[Outro]
I come home to write it all (For me)
I come home to write it all (For me)
I come home to write it all (For me)
I come home, I come home
I come home to write it all (A picture on the wall)
I come home to write it all (Looking back at me)
I come home to write it all (And I can't even talk)
I come home, I come home (I'm floating in a dream)
I'm floating in a dream

[Verse 1]
I sit back and watch TV
Of all the faces on the screen
I have seen none of me, staggeringly
The melting ice caps in my drink
Made me stop and think about
Think about time running out

[Pre-Chorus]
I would quit my job
If I had a job
If I had a job, then I would have everything I want
I would quit my job
If I had a job
If I had a job, then I would have everything I want

[Chorus]
(Do-do-do) I just wanna have a good day
(Do-do-do) I just wanna have a good day
(Do-do-do) And it’s only me that’s standing in my way (Do-do-do)
(Do-do-do) I just wanna have a good day
(Do-do-do) I just wanna have a good day
(Do-do-do) And it’s only me that’s standing in my way (Do-do-do)

[Verse 2]
First my looks and now my friends
Day-by-day, I’m losing them
Losing them, losing collagen, losing elastin
The melting ice caps in my drink
Made me stop and think about
Think about time running out

[Pre-Chorus]
I would quit my job
If I had a job
If I had a job, then I would have everything I want

[Chorus]
(Do-do-do) I just wanna have a good day
(Do-do-do) I just wanna have a good day
(Do-do-do) And it’s only me that’s standing in my way (Do-do-do)
(Do-do-do) I just wanna have a good day
(Do-do-do) I just wanna have a good day
(Do-do-do) And it’s only me that’s standing in my way (Do-do-do)

[Verse 1: Bombay Bicycle Club & Liz Lawrence]
Gonna write you a letter
'Cause you've been on my mind
Wanna get to know you better
I hope you might find
We get lost in the moment
Lost in, lost in the moment
May be just for a moment
Lost in, lost in the moment

[Chorus: Bombay Bicycle Club & Liz Lawrence]
'Cause I hope you'll have some faith in what you find

Alone and living blind
So I'll be your guide in this world we're living in

Both standing side-by-side

[Verse 2: Liz Lawrence & Bombay Bicycle Club]
I'm an open letter
Waiting for your eyes
Want you to know me better
You're reading my mind
Feeling lost in this new world
Lost in, lost in the new world
Might be just for a moment
Lost in the moment

[Chorus: Bombay Bicycle Club & Liz Lawrence]
'Cause I hope you'll have some faith in what you find
'Cause right now, we're lost
Alone and living blind
So I'll be your guide in this world we're living in

Both standing side-by-side

[Bridge: Bombay Bicycle Club & Liz Lawrence]
If you can, we can
Make a subtle difference
If we can, I can
Make it through this moment

[Chorus: Bombay Bicycle Club & Liz Lawrence]
'Cause I hope you'll have some faith in what you find
'Cause right now, we're lost
Alone and living blind
So I'll be (I'll be) your guide (Your guide) in this world we're living in
(World we're living in)
Both standing side-by-side

[Verse 1]
The lights come on
Your shadow days are gone
Hanging on a lonely thread
Going where the last one led

[Pre-Chorus]
All the cracks around your head
Will fill with light, oh
Light, oh

[Chorus]
Do you feel loved?
Do you feel loved?
Do you feel loved?
Do you feel loved?

[Verse 2]
Electric waste
Will wash your doubts away
Soft blue light on the bed
Watch 'til your eyes turn red

[Pre-Chorus]
All the cracks around your head
Will fill with light, oh
Light, oh

[Chorus]
Do you feel loved
When there's more than you can take?
Do you feel loved
When it's flooding every page?
Do you feel loved
When there's more than you can take?
Do you feel loved
When it's flooding every page?
Do you feel loved?
Do you feel loved?

[Bridge]
All the cracks around your head
Will fill with light
Throw your arms around my neck
And hold me tight
All the cracks around your head
Will fill with light
Throw your arms around my neck
And hold me tight
All the cracks around your head
Will fill with light
Throw your arms around my neck
And hold me tight
All the cracks around your head
Will fill with light

[Outro]
Do you feel loved?

Then hope to find them there

[Chorus]
Touching, touching
Me here, me here
Touching, touching
Me there
All the while, the roads are bending
Still I don't know where

[Verse 2]
All the words unopened
Brimming like a crown
Saw you standing at the crossroads
Staring through the clouds
Well, can we stay here longer?
Burn our embers down
Glowing bright for one last moment
Just to fade somehow

[Chorus]
Touching, touching
Me here, me here
Touching, touching
Me there

All the while, the roads are bending
Still I don't know where

Oh, no, no, no, no
Don't you let me let you go
All the while, the roads are bending
Still I don't know

Come and see you tonight
Come and see you tonight
Come and see the cars and the tungsten lights
We'll go in fast and bitter
And leave those doubts that they know nothing about
Come and see you tonight
Come and see you tonight
Come and see the stars and their racing stripes
Among the glass and glitter
You'll sing a song that you know nothing about

Oh
Oh, nothing about
Nothin', nothin'

[Verse 1]
He was alone, outside
On the night his glory died, she just sat and cried
None of the rain that he’d longed for from her face
That’s the penance he could pay for his crime

So he took all he had and he ran
And he ran for his life, left his wife
And how he longed to be a child of the light
And for once in his life, he runs

[Chorus]
Leave, leave me alone with my voices
And leave, leave me alone to my choices
For I will be ruled by my vices

[Verse 2]
So take your leave from the words
As they drip from the mouth of a child, soft and low
Run away from the sins of your rage
And the way you were made to take

[Chorus]
Leave, leave me alone with my voices
And leave, leave me alone to my choices
'Cause I will be ruled by my vices

[Bridge]
Oh, leave, leave me alone with my voices
And leave, leave me alone to my choices
'Cause I will be ruled by my vices

Oh, leave, leave me alone with my voices
And leave, leave me alone to my choices
'Cause I will be ruled by my vices

[Chorus]
(Jesus walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walk with me)

[Verse 1]
You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
Where restless (Niggas) might snatch your necklace
And next these (Niggas) might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these (Niggas) who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless *gasps*
Try to catch it *gasps* it's kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives, yeah, now check the method
They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
Sayin' "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast"
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well mama I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move
I hope

[Chorus]
(Jesus walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break (me down)
(Jesus walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(I want Jesus)
(Jesus walk)
And I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus walk with me)
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid 'cause we ain't spoke in so long
(I want Jesus)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Oh god)
And I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs
(Walk with me)
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid 'cause we ain't spoke in so long
(I want Jesus to walk with me)
(Jesus walk)

[Verse 2]
To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers, even the scrippers
(Jesus walks for them)
To the victims of welfare feel we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah
(Jesus walks for them)
Now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models: we rap, we don't think
I ain't here to argue about His facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out

[Chorus]
(Jesus walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(I want Jesus)
(Jesus walk)
And I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs
(Oh with me)
(Jesus walk with me)
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid 'cause we ain't spoke in so long
(I want Jesus to walk with me)

[Intro]
Yo, I'm going to need a little help with this one
For my homegirl, make some noise for my homegirl
Miri Ben-Ari the hip-hop violinist
Yo, I got a question
I got a question with the ladies right now
How many of yall, how many of y'all got ya shit right for the summer?
Alright, let's try this

[Song Intro]
You just popped in the Kanye West
Get Right for the Summer workout tape
And ladies if you follow these instructions exactly
You might get an athlete or a nigga that raps
Let's go!

[Verse 1]
1, and 2, and 3, and 4, and get them sit ups right, and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop, breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my (dick!)
What's scary to me is
Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came, I came, I came

[Chorus]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothing to talk about
Unless she's talking about freaking out
Then maybe we can work it out
(Rrr, rrr) work it out, work it out (rrr-rrr) (come on!)
(Rrr, rrr) work it out, work it out now (rr-rrr-rrr) (come on now say what?)
Maybe we can work it out

[Verse 2]
Oh, girl, your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set, Twista said "Get It Wet"
Ooh girl your breath is harsh!
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks yea I bought them cars
Still, kill a nigga on 16 bars
We ain't sweating to the oldies, we juking to a cold beat
Maybe one day girl we can bone
So you can brag to all your homies now
But I still mess with a big girl, if you ain't fit girl, I'll still hit girl
1 and, you brought 2 friends, ok, 3 more now hop in the Benz
4-door: do you know the difference between a 5, 6, 7, 8?
All the mocha lattes, you gotta do Pilates
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating
Hustlers, gangstas, all us ballas

[Chorus]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothing to talk about
Unless she's talking about freaking out
Then maybe we can work it out
(Rrr, rrr) work it out, work it out (rrr-rrr) (come on!)
(Rrr, rrr) work it out, work it out now (rr-rrr-rrr) (come on now say what?)
Maybe we can work it out

[Intro: Kanye West]
Oh, yeah...
I got the perfect song for the kids to sing...
And all my people that's—

[Chorus: Choir]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If this is your first time hearing this
You are about to experience something so cold, man
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man
But as a shorty, I looked up to the dope man
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flicking Starter coats, man—man, you don't know, man
We don't care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer they ain't finna say, "Next summer, I'm finna..."
Sitting in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sitting your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job
You gotta do something, man, your ass is grown

[Chorus: Choir & Kanye West]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)
We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
This second verse is for my dogs working nine to five that still hustle
'Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55
And everybody selling makeup, Jacob's
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on lay-away, then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Mama say she wanna move South
Scratching lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job
So since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
So niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep bakin' 'til the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say, my niggas—

[Chorus: Choir & Kanye West]
Drug dealin' just to get by (Yeah)
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
Kids, sing! Kids, sing!
We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive (Alive, uh-huh)
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say" (Yeah, yeah, ugh)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You know the kids gon' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song "12 Questions"
We scream: "rocks, blow, weed, park," see, now we smart
We ain't retards the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now, tell my mama I belong in that slow class
It's bad enough we on welfare
They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
I'm tryna get the car with the chrome-y wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance
Sometimes, I feel no one in this world understands us
But we don't care what people say, my niggas—

[Chorus: Choir & Kanye West]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
Kids, sing! Kids, sing!
We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Yeah, this the real one, baby
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Uh, Chi-Town, stand up!
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh, when it all

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, "Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair."
‘Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, ‘cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retailers, and well

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, "Nigga, you ain't up on this."
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it all falls down

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I say, "Fuck the police," that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', "Where the ballers at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Chi-Town, Chi-Town
We gon' show 'em how we get down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life
C'mon
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

[Verse 1]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

[Verse 2]
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

[Outro]
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?

Hi, this is Mary J. Blige
You're listening to DJ Kost
DJ Kost, DJ Kost, 100%, R&B

I ate a million for lunch
A half a million for breakfast
Everything big in Texas
That’s why I brought this here necklace
Young, flashy and rich
The Texas girls call me sexy
I’m so handsome and healthy
That Gucci brand start investin’
East Atlanta my brethren
1017 I was born
I’m in Texas, no flexin’
My money long like the Horns
Like Attila the Hun
The underdog mighta won
I made a crown outta thorns
In the trap I’m LeBron
I’m Gucci
{Intro:R.Kelly}
This is for the playas in the club, chilling with the shawties in the club. 

[x2]

[talking: Plies]
Ey kell for some reason this fell real special. You know your little homie Plies don't buy shawty

{Hook:R.Kelly}
Shawty got what it takes to make me love her
Take her out and spend money on her
So when you see me in a club and she's next to me
Keep walking cause you know she's right next to me
I'm with her and now you trying to brush up on me
You'r not gonna make me disrespect my shawty

{Verse 1:R.Kelly}
I bought sand to the beaching it's all good
Got that Bentley like a cabin all wood
When and got that her faded looking hollywood
And though I look hollywood and I'm still hood
And I got my shawty next to me she's so fly
Anytime I'm ready to roll she gon ride
She got the best of me I can't lie
Anything my shawty need I'm gon buy
In the mawar getting lower
It's the mawar wanna show her
And then I'm that thug in her life
And I stay in her life
Live for her life and I die for her life
And even though these other chiks flirt with me
My shawty ain't tripping when they flirt with me
So don't be hatting when you see us in the club
Kissing in the club
{Hook:R.Kelly}
Shawty got what it takes to make me love her
Take her out and spend money on her
So when you see me in a club and she's next to me
Keep walking cause you know she's right next to me
I'm with her and now you trying to brush up on me
You'r not gonna make me disrespect my shawty

{Verse 2:Plies}
This is plies baby let me talk to them baby
I fucked with her hard while she my raw pike
And if you don't know what that is sex with no plastic
Enough look me tonight I might ask her to marry me
Then ask her just this time people ain't laughing
She talk with her eye
Getting with that ass
I love about her she make love with so much passion
Ain't like these other bros she got her own fashion
Every nigga want her dog but ain't tripping
Before she goes to the club she ask my permission
Bless her every morning with all my kisses
My roll sample fulfill all her wishes
Probably call her my shawty she earn that position
When she calling me with her bra I listen
Filled a void in her life I'm what she's what missing
First time in a bed I handle my business
Must left hell of a impression I see her again
{Verse 3:R.Kelly}
I see you looking at me mamma sex in your eyes
She see your looking at me mamma she ain't blind
And I admit I'm looking back cause you'r so fine
But believe me lil mama now is not the time
Cause I'm with my girl.Cause it's about my girl
In VIP with my girl
And we are in our world
Man I admit she got a playa in love
Tonight I ain't a thug I'm a eagle with a dove
And even though I wanna hit that big ole
Thinking to myself my girl gotta big ole
Can't keep my fingers off her I call her my piano
She keep it real like pepper mill and pickel
Off in the bentley man we swerving
Pull the car over she early
Lil mama hood and I like her sex
So show us some respect

{Hook:R.Kelly}
Shawty got what it takes to make me love her
Take her out and spend money on her
So when you see me in a club and she's next to me
Keep walking cause you know she's right next to me
I'm with her and now you trying to brush up on me
You'r not gonna make me disrespect my shawty
{Bridge:R.Kelly}
See me in a club with her don't do that
If you see me at the mall with her don't do that
Homie if you see us swolling in the drop don't do that
Girl keep it going don't stop don't do that
Even if you know me don't do that
Act like you don't know me don't do that
Don't you be on that bullshit
Cause it's gonna be bullshit

{Hook:R.Kelly}
Shawty got what it takes to make me love her
Take her out and spend money on her
So when you see me in a club and she's next to me
Keep walking cause you know she's right next to me
I'm with her and now you trying to brush up on me
You'r not gonna make me disrespect my shawty

{Outro:R.Kelly}
Kells plies

This is for the playas in the club, chilling with the shawties in the club.

Lyrics from snippet

[Intro]
Wheezy outta here

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
Fuck all the coco, I'm Tony Montana, I'll shoot at your back (Rrah)
Rich nigga shit, I done caught a lil' thot and I nut on her head
Fish bowl the coupe, I'm not havin' some shit, these lil' niggas get whacked
Told mama I was through, then I turned her around and went and did it again (Yeah)
Trappin' them lil' chickens, gelato, it cost me a cool couple racks (Racks)
You tellin' them lies, are you ready to die? Do you know it yet? (Yeah)
They stealing my pride right in front of my eyes like, what? (What the fuck? Sheesh sheesh)
Giuseppe Zanotti I bought her a thousand, her pussy is washed, what (So wet)
She said: "Yes, let's go (Let's go)

[Chorus: Offset & Young Thug]
Let's go (Let's go), let's go (Let's go)

[Verse 2: Offset & Young Thug]
High-Tech red (Red, Wheezy outta here)
Quarter million dollars my bed (Quarter)
Margiela melt down my leg
I chop the top and my opp through shred
Hermès the couch
Plant me a seed in my bitch and she sprout
Racks in the safe, I defeated the drought (Racks)
These bitches wet, throw in the towel
Throw up my set, boy, I'll beat you to the ground
I got a 

[?] he'll pull up in a 

[?]
Just incase he don't know, I gotta say
Maison Margiela, can't tie with no lace
I been chillin' on a boat eatin' crepes
Pull up in a coupe, cost 200K (Skrrt, skrrt)
Put a AK on your crew toupé
I been drinkin' lean, mixin' Kool-Aid
Money on my team, money on my bae (Team)
I switched the Wraith to the Dodge
Bitch eat a plate full of cum (Eat it)
Know my diamonds got straight from Milan
Change the climate, there's snow in the summer
Please don't speak to me
It's only my brother I keep with me (My brother, my brother)
Please don't bite my fleek
Choppa disease, you gon' die in a week
I got a Glock on my side, but it's more like my main (Ooh)
I told you I'm drinking a pint
I told you I'm bringing the pain
My Capo buy out a whole the van
My opps, they know I ain't playin'
Continue, I shot at his man
Continue, I shot at his man
All my children, they came with a nanny
I can tell you about what I'm drinkin'
I just mixed up a Sprite with a Xanny
I had poured up a four of this Actavis
I been leanin' in it like a 

[?]
Doctor told me these 

[?] raspberry
I do more than drink it, I harass it
Put my glasses on, I see a baddie
Feel like Walter Payton, shawty, catch it (Woo)

[Refrain: Young Thug]
I'ma fill up my safe, I'ma fill up my safe

I'ma fill up my safe, I'ma fill up my safe
I'ma fill up my safe, I'ma fill up my safe

[Verse 4: Offset]
Pass me the rope, hang her
Made this bitch hit a high note while I strangle
My daughter got diamonds, bangles
Half a ticket all on one finger
I pop a Xanny, get angry
Glock 30 with one in the chamber (Pop-pop)
The codeine is startin' to get dangerous
Shh, heard that you singin'

[Refrain: Offset]
Put my wrist on froze, then I had to put my bitch on froze
Put my wrist on froze, then I had to put my bitch on froze

Giuseppes Zanotti I bought her a thousand, her pussy is washed, what
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
She was eager to leave, but it ain't me with my eyes damp
Feet stampeding through mine shafts
Canaries singing, the wire's tapped
Offerings on the shrine, reclaiming my time like Aunt Max
The water was all black, the moon fondling tides
We painting the town red, allegiance is over-pronounced, stand down
We was setting the mousetraps, wouldn't believe who we found dead cleaning house
He was cheesy from back then, I see it now
Speaking down to my demons
Like big dogs, you a mouth breather in denial
SIG Sauer, the heat seeker
Sittin' down with my lawyer for a brief meeting, laying all the pieces out
I think I'd call it mourning, grief rebound
12 months, couldn't form a decent smile, chest heaving
Death reeking in a pile
Eventually I'll leave the house

[Chorus]
Now you see me, now you don't
At the same time, hurdling what I had to
I learned to adapt, way better than I could plan
Now you need me, now I'm gone, pack my feelings up and go
Plant the seedling of some hope
Now you see me, now you don't
At the same time, hurdling what i had to
I learned to adapt, way better than I could plan
Now you need me, now I'm gone
Plant the feeling of some-
Lullaby and good night with roses bedlight
Bright angels around my darling shall stay
Let thee down now and rest
May thy slumber be blessed
Let thee down now and rest
May thy slumber be blessed
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
Nigerian wallet made out of snake
Long face in the bank, short change
This toy would feel like forty stakes
Why we goin' home, patrol the gate
What’s goin' on, I'm in the mall with the Jordan face
High as Hell
Keep the reggie off of seventy, a wedding cake
Tan Cressi’ chain heavenly, the blessings came
Might stretch a bit but never came on the Benz
Barricades, bloodstained messages I never sent
My brain left, see what's left, on the left
Etch A Sketch what I live
Shiverin', erasin' what I did
Okay, be complacent as the wind
My brother, like Sun Ra, we all need you
Godspeed You! Black Emperor
Dark legions, what's the run down
Love song's a piece of summer, the guns now
And let me hit that spliff before that bitch run out
I heard it's up to us, more than enough
I know I'm playin’ to tough crowds
Convert the data ’till our races can whip the bus 'round
We ’bout to shake the taco truck down
Nah, I'm playin' point a couple at the buss down
I'm on the grand stand

[Verse]
Hundred thousand bruises
Pour me water, I reconstitute constant movement
Proven grounds I fell down I was Harry's student
T'es jolie, stripes on me like I'm Freddy Krueger
Shade of the elm tree, you know I blew up before I grew up
You smart, I guess you know what pressure do, huh?
Serengeti pulchritude on a petty new one
Keep the Betty Boops, just tell them send the fetti through us
Stupid, which race is you willing to run?
Strong filaments, I'm finna print me a gun
We all militant, omnipotence, we dealing with source
You all filler, calm killer consortium, my business
Mav getting the torch, Mach lit it
5'9, 9.5 size foot on the door, kicking it
We all in, live nigga galore, no I've been here before
Cry rivers and swim to the shore and chop timber
I'm building a fort, war time
The final resort, but it's not a resort
Discipling the thots, ain't not way we gonna
Be winning them all but we embark, eat a loss
By the seas like 

[?], keep your albatross
And you magic beans, i got a heart pulling strings
And I'm climbing stocks, harken back to the days of yore
Giant sores on my lion heart, time to spark

[Verse]
I want ya
I got four, five, some' on ya
More minutes before the 

[?] goes
Can't 

[?] where I can't go
Dun-dun (Woo)
That's the feel of love
You need to fuck with somebody with some mass appeal
I got one-one, four-four
Got another 

[?] came with a 

[?], uh
That's a no-go, I go loco, uh
I'm a white boy but I'm in love with the coco (Haha)

[Chorus: Madonna]
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
It's human nature (It's human nature)
(Fuck the rain!)
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me (It's human nature)

[Verse 1: Madonna]
You wouldn't let me say the words I longed to say
You didn't want to see life through my eyes
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)
You tried to shove me back inside your narrow room
And silence me with bitterness and lies
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Did I say something wrong?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex
(I must've been crazy)
Did I stay too long?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't speak my mind
(What was I thinking?)

[Chorus: Madonna]
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
(I'm so not sorry!)
It's human nature (It's human nature)
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me (It's human nature)

[Verse 2: Madonna]
You punished me for telling you my fantasies
I'm breaking all the rules I didn't make
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)
You took my words and made a trap for silly fools
You held me down and tried to make me break
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Did I say something true?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex
(I must've been crazy)
Did I have a point of view?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about you
(What was I thinking?)

[Chorus: Madonna]
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
It's human nature (It's human nature)

I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me (It's human nature)

Did I say something true?
Did I have a point of view?
Did I say something wrong?
Or did I stay too long?

[Chorus: Madonna]
'Cause I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
It's human nature (It's human nature)
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me (It's human nature)

Look around, everywhere you turn is heartache
It's everywhere that you go (Look around)
You try everything you can to escape
The pain of life that you know (Life that you know)
If all else fails and you long to be
Something better than you are today
I know a place where you can get away
It's called a dance floor, and here's what it's for, so

[Chorus: Madonna]
Come on, vogue
Let your body move to the music
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, vogue
Let your body go with the flow

All you need is your own imagination
So use it that's what it's for (That's what it's for)
Go inside, for your finest inspiration
Your dreams will open the door (Open up the door)
It makes no difference if you're black or white
If you're a boy or a girl
If the music's pumping it will give you new life
You're a superstar, yes, that's what you are, you know it

[Verse 1]
Clothes off, he needs to come through or cut me off
I understand why he hesitates
Go home, I'd rather be alone than soaked in sweat
Taking a dose to make me forget

[Verse 2]
Fell back into the hotel, underneath the same lights
Eye contact was the last thing I wanted while you looked like that
Jumped into the water, let the iPhone speaker blaring
I can feel their eyesights glaring, classic
Glossed up and getting wasted, this is not my last masterpiece
I am Michelangelo
I still don't know how you feel about us
Boys in the backseat are talkin' about us

[Chorus]
(Alright, mm)
Cold sweat, coke head
I forgot your name in the same place last time, no thanks
Cold sweat, coke head
I forgot your name in the same place last time, no thanks

[Outro]
There's some men out there on the floor
Watchin' me lose myself to disco music
There's some men out there on the floor
Watchin' me lose myself to disco music
There's some men out there on the floor
Watchin' me lose myself to disco music
(Ah, don't you miss me? Don't you miss me?)
There's some men out there on the floor (Ah, no, don't you miss me?)
Watching me lose myself to disco music

[Verse]
Hard times when I needed touch
Need a crutch, need a hug, harsh lines on the easel, blood
Even keeled, but with death, the infrequent brush test me
Don't speak em' up, speakers hum
Free the thugs, we don' weeped enough
Recently released a steam, when I pieced him up
Mischievous as my uncle, mischievous as Juanita was
Peace to Juanita son for checking in
Must have felt the deviance I'm delving in, I'm demon'd up
Forehead creases, dimpled cheeks betray the feeling
Play the shield til' I play the villain
In the field, the killing joke whispering in a ear
Sentimental, a voice quivering with despair
Up there where the air thinner
The mountaineer keep a sharper pair of shears with him
Clip a clear path to the endless
Stack up meal ticket, hands sticky
The tar shiny black, time - you can't buy it back
Please don't throw me to the briar-patch, got his ass!

[Chorus]
I'm back home and I gotta laugh
I'm back home and I gotta laugh
The siren song got me out a jam
And in a, and in a flash, climbing in a bath, damn

[Verse 1]
(Hey)
Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play (Hey)
Hey, went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

[Pre-Chorus]
One day my father he told me
Son, don't let it slip away
He took me in his arms, I heard him say (Hey)
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid

[Chorus]
He said, one day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)

[Verse 2]
When thunderclouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shining stars
He said, go venture far beyond the shores
Don't forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home no matter where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
One day my father he told me
Son, don't let it slip away
When I was just a kid, I heard him say
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid

[Chorus]
He said, one day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
Oooh, oooh
(Hey, hey)

[Outro]
These are the nights that never die
My father told me
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
Oooh, oooh
(Hey, hey)
Oooh, oooh
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
Oooh, oooh
(Hey, hey)
My father told me

[Intro: Rich Homie Quan]
Me and her had never made love 'til I fucked her
Lil’ lil' mama never fell for it 'til I bust her
And you a pretty, pretty girl, no cover
Fuck you with no rubber
Since your family don’t like me I'll let shots go at your brother
And your body look like gold when we fuck in Versace covers
Just because that pussy good, that don't mean that I'ma trust you
That crazy bitch stalkin' my brother Thugger

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
She caught me creepin' with my old ho
She ran up like "yeah, yeah," I was like "no, no"
My lookout man was my right hand but he was wrong though
Then I seen some diamonds come off of my neighbor's porch
And it was her, she had a Louis Vuitton purse clean as detergent
She had the same exact face as my brother's nurse
And he in a hearse, I never looked at it for what it’s worth

[Chorus: Young Thug & Rich Homie Quan]
So I never made love, never made love (Ayy)
Never made love, never made love (Ayy)
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love (Never made)
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never ever ever ever made love
Never made love, never made love
I ain’t never made love (Ayy)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Never made love, never made love (Ayy)
When she open up, I'ma taste her (Try)
X out everyone and then erase her (Ayy)
I’m sorry for lyin' to your face, yeah (Sorry)
I'ma marry her and I bouquet her (Ayy)
Leavin' out the house drunk and she stumbles (Woah)
Be all on her mind, she can’t even think of (Drunk)
She walkin' off, I look at her like cable (Ayy)
Boolin' with your partners at a party, ayy (Fuckin' round)
They don't even know what the fuck love means, ayy (They gon' fuck with me)
She say she never waste time on me (Ahh)
Yeah that came out of your jaws, baby (I heard it)
I heard it, even though I suck it 'til she lockin' up (Ayy)
Lockin' up like handcuffs
Give me all your time, every day (Woo)
Girl how come we never made love at your spot? (Why?)
Cause you ain't want your other rich homie be findin' out (Ayy)
She want it so I spent 12 thousand on a lil' rug (Racks)
I'm just tryna tell you, ain't tryna make you look low

[Chorus: Young Thug & Rich Homie Quan]
Even though you've never made love, never made love (Ayy)
Never made love, never made love, never made love (Ayy)
She never made love, never made love (Ayy)
Never made love, never ever ever (Never made love, ayy)
She never made love, never made love
Never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made
Never felt love, never felt love
Never made love, never made love, never made love

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Well I'ma change that there
I just might wake up and buy you everything rare (Woo)
I'm not cheatin' on you no more, I don't care (Swear to God)
You wanna be with me, I'ma roll the dice now (Roll it)
Roll it, I buy a Rollie, I'ma buy that bitch a Rollie (Roll it)
That pack keep rollin', I'ma buy that bitch some more shit
'Cause I fucked her sister then I fucked on all her cousins
Bitch I'm a Blood, you know I fucked on your bousins
She smiling in your face, but tellin' me she love it (Ayy)
She like the way my pants don't sag even though they're stuffy (Racks)
She won't T.I. on me, she don't care 'bout no money (Sorry)
Hey, hey (Swear to God)
Wait, wait, don't leave (Ayy)
Hey, hey (Swear to God, baby)
Ayy, ayy, hey (I love you like 

[?], baby)

[Verse 4: Young Thug]
They trip out all the time, tellin' you I'm on some bullshit
Parallel parkin' that pussy, they like my motion (Skrt)
Put that on my mama, now Stunna know that I'm loaded (Loaded)
When my partner see it he stand up like he on Folgers (Woo)
I ain't like that shit so I hit him right in his shit
Then I told him, "don't ever do that shit there again" (What?)
How you feel if I see your ho and fuck on the kid? (What?)
I'ma catch a body if she leave me, I'm not playin'
Yes, I said I'm the best and I put that on the red
When you make me mad I tried to get back and get some head
And I know that's wrong, but my dumb ass still did it instead
Then I put the strap to my own head like boy I'm on one, woah
Then I told her don't ever do it again (Uh huh)
Every guy you look at, I'll turn him to wind (Ayy)
Yeah, then I looked up at God like yeah

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug]
Then I realized I'd never made love, never made love (Woo)
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
She never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
She never ever made love
I swear to God I never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Hey, never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love

[Intro]
Oh...

[Verse 1]
Boy, tell me, can you take my breath away?
Cruisin' down a heart-shaped highway
Got you swervin' lane-to-lane, don't hit the brakes
'Cause I'm feelin' so safe

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be your baby, on a Sunday
Oh, why don't we get out of town?
Call me your baby, on the same wave
Oh, no, no, there's no slowin' down

[Chorus]
You and I, I
Ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i
I'm on the back, I'm holdin' tight, I (Oh)
Want you to take me for a ride, ride
When I hula-hula, hula
So good, you'll take me to the jeweler-jeweler, jeweler
There's pink and purple in the sky-y-y
We're ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i

[Verse 2]
Let me run my fingers through your salty hair
Go ahead, explore the island vibes
So real that you can feel it in the air
I'm revvin' up your engine

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be your baby, on a Sunday
Oh, why don't we get out of town? (Why don't we get out of town?)
Call me your baby, catch the same wave
Oh, no, no, there's no slowin' down (Let's go)

[Chorus]
You and I, I
Ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i

Take me 'round the world and back again
As I'm searching for my soul out there
Oh, there's something that I'm wondering (Yeah)
Where I'm going when my story ends

[Pre-Chorus]
Doesn't even matter anyway, no, we're
Focused and I'm coping with the pain, yeah, we're
Only getting older by the day, yeah, we're
Only getting older (Only getting older)
Doesn't even matter anyway, no, we're
Focused and I'm coping with the pain, yeah, we're
Only getting older by the day, yeah, we're
Only getting older (On my mind all the time)

So I'ma light it up, I'm gettin high (So high)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2: Shawn Mendes with Taylor Swift]
We could light a bunch of candles
And dance around the kitchen, baby
Pictures of when we were young would hang on the wall
We would sit on the stoop
I'll sing love songs to you when we're eighty
See, I finally got you now, honey, I won't let you fall

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Shawn Mendes, Shawn Mendes]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Shawn Mendes & Both]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
Look in my eyes, they will tell you the truth
The girl in my story has always been you
I'd go down with the Titanic, it's true, for you, lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover (Save you a seat)

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Shawn Mendes, Shawn Mendes & Taylor Swift]
Can I go where you go? (Can I go where you go, baby?)
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

[Intro]
S.O.S, she's in disguise
S.O.S, she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

[Verse 1]
A domesticated girl, that's all you ask of me
Darling, it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
The moon's awake now, with eyes wide open
My body's craving, so feed the hungry

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've been devoting myself to you
Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution
Or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused
Like a coffee machine in an office (Uh)
So I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover
And tell you about it

[Chorus]
There's a she-wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free (Ah-ooh)
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

[Verse 2]
Sitting across a bar, staring right at her prey
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher and I'm her student

[Pre-Chorus 2]
To locate the single men, I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys
I just want to enjoy (Uh)
By having a very good time
And behave very bad in the arms of a boy

[Chorus]
There's a she wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free (Ah-ooh)
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

[Bridge]
S.O.S, she's in disguise
S.O.S, she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out
S.O.S, she's in disguise
S.O.S, she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

[Outro]
There's a she wolf in the closet
Let it out so it can breathe

[JOE]
If you knew Susie
Like we know Susie
Oh, oh, oh, what a gal!
She's not so choosy
No, not our Susie
Oh, oh...

[CLARENCE]
Susie is a lollapaloozie

[JOE]
When Susie kisses

[CLARENCE]
It never fails

[JOE]
When Susie kisses
She takes the wind
Right out of your sails
So in conclusion

[CLARENCE]
Beware of Susion

[JOE & CLARENCE]
Oh, oh, oh, what a gal!

[JOE]
S is for sincerity
Which she's got none of

[CLARENCE]
U is for you-know-what-I-mean

[JOE]
S is for...

[CLARENCE]
Sincerity

[JOE & CLARENCE]
Which she's got none of

[JOE]
I is for the Irish in her smile

[JOE & CLARENCE]
Her Irish smile

[CLARENCE]
E is for the eagerness to please us

[JOE]
That is how she won her Navy E!

[JOE & CLARENCE]
Put them all together
They spell Susie
The sweetheart of the boys at sea

[CLARENCE]
Oh, that Susie
She's a doozy
She's not choosy
You won't lose-y

[JOE]
Don't care who-sie

[CLARENCE]
I mean you-sie

[JOE]
You'll get woozy
After just one date with Susie

[CLARENCE]
When you take her home about 10
Another gob is waiting here
To take our Susie out again

[JOE]
So in conclusie

[CLARENCE]
Beware of Susie

[JOE & CLARENCE]
She belongs to you and you and me

[JOE]
And the U. S. Navy

[JOE & CLARENCE]
S, S-U, S-U-S
S-U-S-I, S-U-S-I-E

[Verse 1]
You're a song written by the hands of God
Don't get me wrong
'Cause this might sound to you a bit odd
But you own the place
Where all my thoughts go hiding
And right under your clothes
Is where I find them

[Chorus]
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

[Verse 2]
'Cause of you
I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you
I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone
When the party's over
We will still belong to each other

[Chorus]
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl
For being such a, ah, ah

[Bridge]
I love you more than all that's on the planet
Movin', talkin', walkin', breathin'
You know it's true
Oh, baby, it's so funny
You almost don't believe it
As every voice is hanging from the silence
Lamps are hanging from the ceiling
Like a lady tied to her manners
I'm tied up to this feeling

[Chorus]
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey
Underneath your clothes
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl
For being such a good girl

[Verse 1]
Lucky you were born that far away so
We could both make fun of distance
Lucky that I love a foreign land for
The lucky fact of your existence
Baby, I would climb the Andes solely
To count the freckles on your body
Never could imagine there were only
Ten million ways to love somebody

[Pre-Chorus]
Le ro lo le lo le, le ro lo le lo le
Can't you see? I'm at your feet

[Chorus]
Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear
Thereover, hereunder
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
But that's the deal, my dear

[Verse 2]
Lucky that my lips not only mumble
They spill kisses like a fountain
Lucky that my breasts are small and humble
So you don't confuse them with mountains
Lucky I have strong legs like my mother
To run for cover when I need it
And these two eyes that for no other
The day you leave will cry a river

[Pre-Chorus]
Le ro lo le lo le, le ro lo le lo le
At your feet
I'm at your feet

[Chorus]
Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear
Thereover, hereunder
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
But that's the deal, my dear

[Bridge]
Le ro le le lo le, le ro le le lo le
Think out loud, say it again
Le ro lo le lo le lo le
Tell me one more time
That you'll live
Lost in my eyes

[Chorus]
Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear
Thereover, hereunder
You've got me head over heels
There's nothing left to fear
If you really feel the way I feel
Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear
Thereover, hereunder
You've got me head over heels
There's nothing left to fear
If you really feel the way I feel

[Verse 1]
I left a note on my bedpost
Said, "Not to repeat yesterday’s mistakes"
What I tend to do when it comes to you
I see only the good, selective memory
The way you make me feel, yeah, you gotta hold on me
I've never met someone so different
Oh, here we go
You a part of me now
You a part of me
So where you go I follow, follow, follow

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you
Ohh, ohh, I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you
Ohh, ohh

[Verse 2]
I go back again
Fall off the train
Land in his bed
Repeat yesterday’s mistakes
What I'm tryna say is not to forget
You see only the good, selective memory
The way he makes me feel like
The way he makes me feel, I never seemed to act so stupid
Oh, here we go
He a part of me now
He a part of me
So where he goes I follow, follow, follow

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you
Ohh, ohh, I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you<
Ohh, ohh, I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you

[Intro: Carlinhos Brown]
Essa bola vai rolar
O mundo é um tapete verde
Quando a bola chega lá
Coração fica na rede, na rede, na rede
Ola, ola!

[Chorus]
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
La!
I dare you

[Verse 1]
You have arrived, it's the place
No more doubts the time is coming
Feel how the planet, become one
Like a drum destiny's calling
German, Colombians, Spanish and French
Off the bench you gotta own it
Down here we play, like we dance
It's Brazil and now you know it

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it true that you want it?
Then act like you mean it
With everyone watching
It's truth or dare, can you feel it?

[Chorus] 2X
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
La!
I dare you

[Verse 2]
You're a good soldier
Choosing your battles
Pick yourself up and dust yourself off
Get back in the saddle
You're on the front line
Everyone's watching
You know it's serious, we're getting closer
This isn't over

[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 1]
All aboard the bulletin board, the machine
I animorph into an organ, a spleen
Private school boy in uniform assembly
Mm, I will assume form, join the workforce, the colony

[Chorus]
Conveyor for you
Conveyor for you

[Verse 2]
The fire ants die for a chance at the queen
The carpenter bee dies when he finally leaves a sting
To be in vein runnin' through your vain body
I will step on a belt, put my life on a shelf, one of many

[Chorus]
Conveyor for you, ah
Conveyor for you
Conveyor for you
Conveyor for you, you

Thought it would've been better
Need to learn to commit better
Memories in the living room
You need to cry, I'ma give you room, baby
Watchin' you stand by, yeah
Burning it like a campfire
Girl, I know that I'm M.I.A
But I need you to stand by

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I want you the way you want me too
In every way
In every way
Uh, aye

[Chorus]
You are fine, way lit too
But I'm searching for a light while I'm in the dark, yeah
I'm yellin' "five four three two"
I can't find a way to bounce, sittin' in my heart, yeah
And every girl that I speak to
Seem cool when it startin' and we in the dark, uh
Tryna tell lil mama big coupe
But it seems you wanna
Jump to conclusions
Jump to conclusions
Jump to conclusions
Jump to conclusions

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I said I would just be sober
But tonight I feel like what I said is over
I'm drinkin' out, drinkin' out, drinkin' out the bottle
Tonight, I don't like being sober

[Interlude: Taiye Selasi, Michael Chabon, Ezra Miller]
We have no place that we can claim without contention
We are constructing a whole new edifice of boxes to put people in
To protect a space inside which you can exist
Very concerned about giving names, giving names
Dissatisfaction seems like the natural byproduct of identification

[Interlude: Ayesha K. Faines]
I truly believe that people who define you control you
And the most significant thing that any person can do
But especially black women and men
Is to think about who gave them their definitions
And rewrite those definition for themselves

Now that they are gone, you know the truth it can be told
They were sacrificial lambs in the market place sold

My life to something
Something bigger than me
I gave

I wish I could dedicate my life
My life to something bigger
Something bigger than me
The Earth ever spins on its axis
I'm spinning in echopraxis
My life does not belong to me

[Chorus]
I gave my life to something
Something bigger than me

The galaxy's a broken mirror
Slowly, the asteroid gets nearer
My strife does not belong to me

Why don't you wear some color?
It'd bring out your eyes
You say you'd never bother
'Cause you'd be telling lies
Why don't you try some earth tones?
Since you claim you wanna die
The color of compost
Might make you feel revived
Well, I think it'd look great on you
Go on, show yourself
There's nothing to be scared of
Do it for your health, yeah
Say I wanna change you
That was never true
Look up at the grey hues
They could all be shades of blue

[Interlude: Taiye Selasi]
I insist upon my right to be multiple
I insist upon my right to be multiple
Even more so, I insist upon
The recognition of my multiplicity

[Interlude: Ezra Miller]
All things encompassed in one

[Interlude: Taiye Selasi]
I-I really do insist that others recognize my inherent multiplicity
What I no longer do is take pains to explain it or defend it
That is an exhausting (Exhausting), repetitive (Repetitive), and draining project (Draining project)
To constantly explain and defend one's multiplicity
So I've reached a point where
I am aware of my inherent multiplicity
And anyone wishing to meaningfully engage with me or my work
Must be too (Must be too)

[Outro: Taiye Selasi]
I can also, also, also, also, and, and, and
Who wants to be right as rain
It’s better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do’s a game

When night comes and your all on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who want to be right as rain
It’s harder when your on top

'Cause when hard work don’t pay off
And I’m tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I’m concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won’t be making up
I’ve cried my heart out
And now I’ve had enough of love

Who wants to be riding high
When you’ll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don’t get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when your at your worst
You know how to feel things

See when hard work don’t pay off
And I’m tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I’m concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won’t be making up
I’ve cried my heart out
And now I’ve had enough of love

Go ahead and still my heart
To make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then

When we were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game

'Cause who wants to be right as rain
It’s better when something is wrong
I get excitement in your bones
Even thought everything’s a strain
When night comes and I’m all on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
So who want to be right as rain
It’s harder when your on top

'Cause when hard work don’t pay off
And I’m tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I’m concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won’t be making up
I’ve cried my heart out
And now I’ve had enough of love
Right under my feet there’s air made of bricks
Pulls me down turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I’m forever excusing your intentions

And I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I’m the only one in love
I’m the only one in love

Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees

As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You’ve burnt my heart to stone
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I’m the only one in love
I’m the only one in love

Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I’m standing my own ground
You build me up, then leave me dead

Well I hear your words you made up
So I say your name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I’m the only one in love
I’m the only one in love
You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact

I say we've only known each other one year
You say I've known you longer my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other, think we'll never match at all, but we do
But we do, but we do, but we do

I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more
I've never known this, never before
You're the first to make out whenever we are two
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative
You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining
You think we would and we do, but we do, but we do, but we do

Favouritism ain't my thing but
In this situation I'll be glad...
Favouritism ain't my thing but,in this situation I'll be glad to make an exception

You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other one year
You say I've known you longer my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other, think we'll never match at all, but we do
When we used to say goodnight
I'd always kiss and hold you tight
But lately you don’t seem to care
You close the door and leave me standing there

Oh, honey
That's not fair
That's it, I quit, I’m movin' on

The other night we had a date
And you showed up two hours late
And though your hair was all in place
Somebody smeared their lipstick on your face

Oh, they smeared it every place
Yeah that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on
Oooohhhh

You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble and fall
But if I can't have you the way I want you
I don't want you at all
Baby, I can take a lot
'Cause I love everything you got
Though your kisses fill me
So if you got someone else I gotta go

Oh, that you know
Yeah that’s it honey
I quit I’m movin' on

Oooohhhh

You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble and fall
But if I can’t have you the way I want you
I don't want you at all

Baby, I can take a lot
'Cause I love everything you got
Though your kisses fill me
So if you got someone else I gotta go

Oh, that you know
Yeah that's it honey
I quit I’m movin' on
I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong, I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love, but
If I tell the world, I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you

Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally, could this be it, or?
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere? Yeah

Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Oh, oh

Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Go ahead
Go ahead, smash it on the floor
Take whatever's left
And take it with you out the door

See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tear
Can't say that it's been that great
No, in fact, it's been a wasted, worried year

Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way too long
Take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Let it out
Let it all out, say what's on your mind
You can kick and scream and
Shout and say things that are so unkind

Yeah, see if I care
See if I stand firm or if I fall
'Cause in the back of my mind and on the tip of my tongue
Is the answer to it all

And everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way too long
Take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah, there's many shades of black

Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way too long
So take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And you cannot take it back
No, you cannot take it back
Yes, there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah, there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah, there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Go ahead

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 1]
On the long hike through
Blue Ridge Mountains
I can feel the earth
Overtake my skin
And I realize none
Of this matters
'Cause I will return
To dust and matter

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Cheers to the patriarchs
And the marble arch
Playin' the part
The gatekeeper's march

[Chorus]
Desperate for passing grades
The virility fades
You've got the wrong guy
You wanna slip right in
Amp up the masculine
You've got the wrong idea, son
Dear son
We pick our own prisons

[Verse 2]
To stake dominion over all that one surveys
Is the virile, viral way

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Here's to the boys
And the noise
Playin' the part
The gatekeeper's march

[Chorus]
Desperate for passing grades
The virility fades
You've got the wrong guy
You wanna fit right in
Amp up the masculine
You've got the wrong "I"
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
You've got the wrong idea, son
Dear, son
You pick your own prison

[Bridge]
You want dominion to make minions of the stars
Made up of what you are
Are, are, are, are, are
You are, are, are, are, are

[Chorus]
Desperate for passing grades
The virility fades
You've got the wrong guy
You wanna fit right in
Amp up the masculine
You've got the wrong idea, son

Isolation comes from "insula" which means island
Isolation comes from "insula" which means island

Here we go into the græ

[Verse 1]
When I'm weary and so worn out
Ooh, when my mind's clouded and filled with doubt
That's when I feel the most alive
Masochistic kisses are how I thrive
(Thrive, thrive, thrive, thrive, thrive, thrive, thrive)
Hmm (Hmm)

[Verse 2]
A stiffness inside my neck, and
Bangin' my head against the desk (Woah)
If there's no pain, is there any progress?
That's when I feel, yeah, the most alive, woah
Endurance is the source of my pride (Source of my pride)

[Chorus]
Might not be healthy for me, but seemingly I need (Uh, hmm, hmm)
What cuts me, cuts me, cuts me, cut me, cut me, cut me

[Verse 3]
Uh
Guess I'm a true immigrant son
No vacancies, no vacations
Sure, I could do better than this
But I don't (I don't), I won't (I don't), I don't
No, I don't

[Chorus]
Uh, might not be healthy for me but seemingly I need (No, mm)
Uh, what cuts me, cuts me, cuts me, cut me, cut me, cut me

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-oh
(Might not be healthy for me but seemingly I need)
Ooh-ooh-oh
(What cuts me, cuts me, cuts me, cut me, cut me, cut me)
Hurt me, hurt me
Me
Hurt me, hurt me

[Verse 1]
In the meantime, we'll get it straight
I hope our friendship can recuperate
'Cause I've held you in place
Of a wife in the space
A spouse would hold
Only with you, I'm safe

[Chorus]
In bloom with room to grow
I'm only watering the seeds you sowed
In my heart, in my chest, six feet beneath the flesh
When you held my hand, but you signed "BFF"

[Verse 2]
Oh, no, oh, oh, oh
I hope you're not another supplement
For absent relationships
'Cause when we're close in the car
Or in the store, or in a bar
Sometimes I want to kiss my friends

[Bridge]
(Ooh, ooh)
You don't want that, do you?
You just want someone to listen to you
Who ain't tryna screw you (Ooh, yeah)
I swear I want that too, yeah
I just want someone to listen to me
Who ain't tryna do me

[Outro]
(Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
As the night becomes dawn
You and I become one
You take my face in palm
And call me the morning sun

[Intro]
Da-da-da-da-da-da, da-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo

[Verse 1]
When I was a little boy
I'd scream at vague misty nights
Yet breathe out smoke with no fire
I’d become one with what I was scared of
I fell in love with the in-between
Coloring in the margins
Yet the romance of the undefined
Was a threatening lie in their eyes

[Chorus]
They say, "Oh, who is he?"
Nobody
"Hello, who is he?"
Nobody

[Verse 2]
I'm not at peace with dying alone
But I'm not at war either
No, I am planted on the shore knowing
The ashen tide may or may not rise

[Pre-Chorus]
’Cause in the valley of the sure
You cannot be neither/nor
You're fated to pick a door
Only the lonely are lukewarm

[Chorus]
They say, "Oh, who is he?"
Nobody
"Hello, who is he?"
Nobody

[Bridge]
Yeah
Yeah
Ah, yeah
Hey
Is it a ghost?
Is it a plane?
Is it a shiver down your spine?
Is it delusion?
Is it confused?
Is it contusion of a hard-earned truth?

[Outro]
No, it's nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody

[Verse 1]
You remain in motion
Bottom of the ocean
Not yet sick of sycophants
Tellin' you their true lies
Like, "No moon is higher,"
Hollow as a hallway
Your fist fits right through me
If I split my body into two men
Would you then love me better?
Octopus myself so you weather this

[Pre-Chorus]
Sea-ea-ea polly
Sea-ea-ea polly
See-ee-ee, see me

[Chorus]
You love dancin' with me
Or you just love dancin'
Polly, polly, polly

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna live here
Sometimes don't wanna live at all
I want to be cotton candy
In the mouth of many a lover
Saccharine and slick technicolor
I'll dissolve
I know that won't solve this (I want to dissolve)
Evolve into rain and spit
You make me go unstitched
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Are you dancin' with me?
Or just merely dancin'?
Polly, polly, polly
Yeah

[Verse 3]
One, two, three, four, five, six
Am I just your Friday dick?
Cornucopia of just-in-cases
You'll never have to chase this

[Outro]
Woah, polly, oh, polly
Obviously don't think much of me
Polly, yeah, oh, polly
Polly, yeah, polly, yeah
Polly, ooh
I had two dogs
In the summer of 2004
One was boot black
The other whiter than a health food store
Medicine hogged
The floor space on the back porch
Donations my monarchs saved up
To take up to the poor

Oh, the backyard sang
A chorus of barks from Yin and Yang
They played angel and demon
But oh, I loved them just the same
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Strange how what heals can also kill

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, oh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, oh-ooh-ooh, oh

I found two dogs
On the hot concrete of the back porch
One in amniotic vomit
The other in fetal contort
Medicine clogged
Their stomachs 'til they overpoured
Strange how what heals can also kill
They both went grey
Adopting a putrid, lifeless stench
I learned in death
We all are unified in countenance

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Eyes bulging like they'd finally seen the truth

The type of shit a child forgets
But the memory resets
When you ask me in a worried fret
"Have you ever at least loved a pet?"

[Verse 1]
Oh
You wanna strip away
Veracity is great
But you'll bleed
And all
For a lukewarm embrace
You serrate your face
With glee

[Chorus]
Don't waste your candor
On bystanders
They'll watch you waste, waste, waste, waste away

[Verse 2]
What's the use of confessing the truth
To an executioner in a booth
About the dueling forces in you?
Now you barely remember your youth
You used to embrace the eerie and helm
Visitations from spirit realms
Gifted to see between astral planes
Now you plead to be plain

[Chorus]
A bystander
Of bygone standards
They'll watch you waste away, waste away, waste away, waste away
Don't waste your candor
On bystanders
They'll watch you waste away, waste away, waste away, waste away
(Waste away, waste away, waste away)

[Post-Chorus]
(They'll watch you waste away, waste away, waste away)
The minute you mitigate your fire (Waste away, waste away, waste away)
The innocence of carnal desire (Waste away, waste away, waste away)
Is stolen (Waste away, waste away, waste away)
It's stolen (Waste away, waste away, waste away)

[Verse 3]
And it's true that the truth gives you free
But when truth is a breach of decree
Dying for praise from a gallery
Whose morality is grey
And they tie all their stones to your name
And they cripple your bones with their shame
Honesty is the most moral way
But morality is grey

[Verse 1]
Hey, after all these years
I'm still here, fingers outstretched
With your imprint in my bed
A pit so big I lay on the edge
Will love let me down again?
Oh no, no, it won't get in
I'm left wonderin'
If it's written on my urn
That I'll burn alone
Like a star

[Chorus]
I wonder how I'll sleep at night
With a cavity by my side
And nothing left to hold but pride, will I
Hold out for more time?

[Verse 2]
Hey me in twenty years
Does your milk still turn to rot too soon?
Do you still hoard souvenirs
And make them mirrors
Of sentimental veneer?

[Chorus]
I wonder how I'll sleep at night
With a cavity by my side
And nothing left to hold but pride, will I...

[Bridge]
Hold out a little bit more?
A little bit more, more, just a little bit more
A little bit more, more, just a little bit more
A little bit longer, just a little bit more (Hold out for more time)
A little bit longer, just a little bit more
A little bit longer, just a little bit more
A little bit more, more, just a little bit more
A little bit more, more, just a little bit more

[Chorus]
And I wonder how I'll sleep at night
With a cavity right by my side
And nothing left to hold but pride of mine

[Outro]
Is it laced within my DNA
To be braced in endless January?
Have I become the cavity I feared?
Ask me in twenty years

[Verse 1]
Finding it hard to differentiate
Are my proclivities of society or innate?
Well, the source is irrelevant when it comes to truth
And the truth is I want the same thing that you do
Childlike curiosity about my fate
Is the only thing that makes me stay

[Chorus]
It keeps me alive
It keeps me alive
It keeps me alive
It keeps me breathin' right

[Verse 2]
And yet the holy grail beckons
"Hey, your chalice could still be filled some day by someone"
Childlike curiosity about my fate
Is the only thing that makes me stay
Though I've never been a sucker for codependency
I'm taken by the possibility

[Chorus]
It keeps me alive
It keeps me alive
It keeps me alive
Oh, it keeps me breathin' right

[Verse 1]
Just because you didn't love me
The way I thought I should be loved
Doesn't mean I wasn't wanted
Or I wasn't something to be proud of
Bitter then, better now
Olé, olé since you left me
I guess I'll go count all
My limbs and my blessings

[Chorus]
So lucky me
I had somebody show me there's another way to go
Lucky me
I have two eyes in the back of my head, and I am not dead
Lucky me
I have working hands and working feet
And a waking memory of you and me
When I need a way out
I remember

[Bridge]
I know that you don't fuck with me no more and that's okay
I still feel you when I go to sleep and when I awake

[Chorus]
Oh, lucky me
I had somebody who showed me there's another way to go
Lucky me
I found somebody who understands that I'm barely a man
Lucky me (Lucky, lucky me)
I have working hands and working feet
And a waking memory of you and me
I had you
I have you

[Verse 2]
You're a star
And although we bleed the same way
The big world needs you more
So go on again
Be reckless with me, all things end
So go, so go on again
Be honest with yourself (Honest with yourself)
All things end
So go, so go on, pretend
So go on again
So go on again
So go on again

[Interlude: Taiye Selasi]
And so I come to isolation
Etymologically, isolation comes from "insula," which means island
I-so-la-tion, isolation, which literally means to be islanded
And somebody mentioned this to me the other day
Actually my Cape Verdean hairdresser
Because I asked her, "How do you say this word in Portuguese?"
And she said, "Isolada," like an island
Like you're-you're, you're islanded
And I thought, that's exactly what I've been my whole life
I've been islanded

[Verse 1]
It's so predictable
To farm the parable
From every tête-à-tête
But when you see the end
In every beginning
Lessons are all you get

[Chorus]
Bless me
Before you go
You're goin' nowhere with me

[Verse 2]
Met you in the wrestling pit
You came when I needed it
Ah, a body on top of me
To teach me
Stayed up past the witching hour
You showed me your secret powers
I wish that mine
Could freeze time

[Chorus]
Bless me
Before you go
You're goin' nowhere with me
Bless me
Before you go
You're goin' nowhere with me

[Verse 3]
Cupid has it out for me
Gave me crooked alchemy
Eros, oh god of flings
Sees the beauty in all things
As stupid's as stupid does
I grasp your cloak because
Maybe you'll grant me wings
If I cling

[Chorus]
Bless me
Before you go
You're goin' nowhere with me
Bless me
Before you go
You're goin' nowhere with me

[Verse 4]
You must be an angel
Your conscience is clean
Why would you soil yourself
With a monster like me?
If the good lord sent ya
The good lord can take ya back
I hope when he comes for you
You illuminate the path

[Bridge]
(Bless me before you go)
(Bless me before you go)
Oh, ooh, ooh
You're goin' nowhere with me, me
You're goin' nowhere with me, me
You're goin' nowhere with me
You're goin' nowhere with me

[Chorus]
Bless me
Before you go
You're goin' nowhere with me

[Outro]
Bless me
Before you go

[Interlude: Michaela Coel, Ezra Miller, and Taiye Selasi]
The ache
The aching
A lot of creation stories begin with separation
The ache
The ache
What does it mean to be in love?
The ache
What does in love mean? What does in love mean?
What does in love mean?
I don't know, I don't
I'm in love everyday, I love
The ache
The aching
The aching
When we die, we won't be together
The aching
The aching
You will never see that person again
Now go

[Verse]
Today it is my birthday so me and my friends
Took ourselves a trip to an old drive-in
Played some 80s hits on an old cassette
Bought a couple Razzles and some Raisinets
Lights were going down as we climbed on up
Lawn chairs on the hood of a pick up truck
My 3D glasses hit the movie screen
I couldn’t take them down you know this life’s a dream
I’ll be watchin’ the show
Another piece of the cake
And ready to go

[Chorus]
La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La
Ba, Ba, Ba
La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La
Ba, Ba, Ba

[Outro]
Lighting the candles gonna make my wish
Close my eyes you’ll never know what it is
At the end, of the show i’ll get another piece of the cake
And take it to go

[Intro]
Jewelry store
Run Forest, run
We ain't see the chopper, why you playin' with the gun?
Run Forest, run Forest, run
Feel like Forrest Gump, when they put him in the trunk

[Refrain]
Mister, nosy reporter, ain't missed ya
Fuck off my line, get the fuck off my dick, I set trends
Been legit, since a lil' git
Hoe by my side and fo-fo on my hip (Pistol mean)

[Chorus]
When I hit the lean, it gets the best of me (I ain't goin')
Won't let this LSD get the best of me (Hell no, I ain't goin')
Won't let amphetamines get the best of me (I ain't goin')
Won't let my legacy be the best of me (Hell no, I ain't goin', woo)
Blowing through my desks of trees, my destiny (I ain't goin')
Working on a better me, do what's best for me (Hell no, I ain't goin', woo)
Won't let these haters be the fucking death of me (I ain't goin')
Won't-won't let me get ahead of me (Hell no, I ain't goin', uh)

[Verse 1]
Penitentiary visions, my chemistry pitch a flux
I mean, "Who are we kidding?" Surpassed my grade and above
Ain't a mil? Then I'm walking, be sure to pay me my bucks
This ain't the NBA baby, you can't 2k me, I'm up
Can't NFL me like Trump, just "Gucci Gang" me like Pump
Like Gucci Mane with a cup, my Gucci came with a pump
My Coogi fit me like Puff, like Gucci rap off the snuff
Try and take pics of me in clubs, those end up off the drugs

[Chorus]
Won't let the lean get the best of me (I ain't goin')
Won't let this LSD get the best of me (Hell no, I ain't goin')
Won't let amphetamines get the best of me (I ain't goin')
Won't let my legacy be the best of me (Hell no, I ain't goin', woo)
Blowing through my desks of trees, my destiny (I ain't goin')
Working on a better me, do what's best for me (Hell no, I ain't goin', woo)
Won't let these haters be the fucking death of me (I ain't goin')
Won't-won't let me get ahead of me (Hell no, I ain't goin', uh)

[Verse 2]
Won't give niggas my back just for a nigga to stab
Or wife one of these nats, just for a nigga to smash
Behind my back, on my behalf, I ain't hearin', "Oh my bad"
Tryna take it on, expect to give them your last
Ever since my sobriety, it's like I've been in my bag
Toast with a glass, invite the ghost of my past
I'd rather smoke opponents, your grade was closer to ash
The masses taking notes, so why nosy folks wanna ask

[Refrain]
Mister, nosy reporter, ain't missed ya
Fuck off my line, get the fuck off my dick, I set trends
Been legit, since a lil' git
Hoe by my side and fo-fo on my hip (Pistol mean)

[Chorus]
When I hit the lean, it gets the best of me (I ain't goin')
Won't let this LSD get the best of me (Hell no, I ain't goin')
Won't let amphetamines get the best of me (I ain't goin')
Won't let my legacy be the best of me (Hell no, I ain't goin', woo)
Blowing through my desks of trees, my destiny (I ain't goin')
Working on a better me, do what's best for me (Hell no, I ain't goin', woo)
Won't let these haters be the fucking death of me (I ain't goin')
Won't-won't let me get ahead of me (Hell no, I ain't goin', uh)

[Intro]
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Never had a lot, but I made a lot
They told a story, I changed the plot
Now I'm savin' up for that plane or yacht
Them extra channels, that cablebox, yeah
I'm faithful to that cablebox
That money good, but that pain is not
They said, "Damn, you changed a lot," but

[Chorus]
They don't know my bitch's name
Said, they don't know my bitch's name
And I don't mean to hurt your feelings, babe
I don't mean to hurt your feelings, babe, whoa, whoa
Said, they don't know my bitch's name
Said, they don't know my bitch's name, no, no
And I don't mean to hurt your feelings, babe
I don't mean to hurt your feelings, babe, whoa, whoa

[Verse 1]
What's your life like?
She'll come back for the right price
Might blind you with them bright lights
No one wanna be Christ-like
Shit too hard, still wanna figure out who you are
The drugs in my system, they worried I took it too far, but
But-but I built this, mo-motherfucker, I built this, and
And along the way I never made a kill switch, 'cause
'Cause I won't stop 'til my heart give, and stop tickin' like a old clock
They knock, knock, knock, knock, my door lock
It won't open up for no one (No one)
My head up, I keep goin'
They thinkin' I should slow up (Slow up)
Explode, I been shakin' up the soda
Hol' up (Hol' up), this mine, don't touch
They see my white skin, eyes lit up, they sayin', "Gold rush"
I'm, still eatin' breakfast, some Cocoa Puffs
I can't sleep, my eyes just won't shut (Shut)
My mom thinks I'm doin' too much (Much)
She say, "Slow down, don't rush" (Rush)

[Pre-Chorus]
Never had a lot, but I made a lot
They told a story, I changed the plot
Now I'm savin' up for that plane or yacht
Them extra channels, that cablebox, yeah
I'm faithful to that cablebox
That money good, but that pain is not
They said, "Damn, you changed a lot," but

[Chorus]
They don't know my bitch's name
Said, they don't know my bitch's name
And I don't mean to hurt your feelings, babe
I don't mean to hurt your feelings, babe, whoa, whoa
Said, they don't know my bitch's name
Said, they don't know my bitch's name, no, no
And I don't mean to hurt your feelings, babe
I don't mean to hurt your feelings, babe, whoa, whoa

[Verse 2]
I'm, wakin' up from this coma
Called her on the mobile phone
Askin' her if she's goin' home
Or she's still sleepin' over
I mighta lost my fragile soul
I could probably use a loaner
No emotion, playin' poker
Once I moved to California
She lost a lot of that trust in me
Can't say she don't get a rush when she fuckin' me
Subsequently I'm prayin' to a angel
Where did all the pain go?
So unstable, the cocaine is on the table

[Bridge]
Girl, let's take off, let's get out of here
Goin', goin', a different atmosphere awaits us
I tend to talk a lot and you don't say much
But everything I say just ain't enough, no
Say I need to let that love show
You knock me down so fast, I'm gettin' up slow
Yeah, everything ain't perfect
Standin' there on judgment day, like was it all worth it? Uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Never had a lot, but I made a lot
They told a story, I changed the plot
Now I'm savin' up for that plane or yacht
Them extra channels, that cablebox, yeah
I'm faithful to that cablebox
That money good, but that pain is not
They said, "Damn, you changed a lot," but

[Chorus]
They don't know my bitch's name
Said, they don't know my bitch's name
And I don't mean to hurt your feelings, babe
I don't mean to hurt your feelings, babe, whoa, whoa
Said, they don't know my bitch's name
Said, they don't know my bitch's name, no, no
And I don't mean to hurt your feelings, babe
I don't mean to hurt your feelings, babe, whoa, whoa

[Hook]
You drive me insane, mhm, yeah, mhm
You drive me insane, mhm, yeah, mhm
You drive me insane, mhm, yeah, mhm(Insane)
You drive me insane, mhm, Insane, mhm(Insane)

[Verse 1]
Girl you got me out my muthafuckin' mind(Mind)
Here and over there
You got me dancin' on the line
You drive me up the wall
And through the ceiling(Through the ceiling)
I thought I seen it all
Till you walked into my buildin'
*Withcho* pretty brown eyes
*and your* dirty blonde hair
*you the* queen at tellin' lies
You absurd, I ain't scared
You the coffee in my cup
Every night you keep me up
You in the rari and you drunk cause

[Hook]
You drive me insane, mhm, yeah, mhm
You drive me insane, mhm, yeah, mhm
You drive me insane, mhm, yeah, mhm(Insane)(what you talkin' bout I don't know what you talkin' bout)
You drive me insane, mhm, Insane, mhm(Insane)what you talkin' bout I don't know what you talkin' bout)

[Verse 1]
Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
(Ten) Ground Control (Nine) to Major Tom (Eight, seven)
(Six) Commencing (Five) countdown, engines on
(Four, three, two)
Check ignition (One) and may God's love (Liftoff) be with you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirt you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

[Chorus]
For here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Verse 3]
Though I'm past 100,000 miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you

[Chorus]
Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Spy, spy, pretty girl
I see you see me through your window
Don't turn your nose up
Well, you can if you need to
You won't be the first or last

[Verse 2]
It must strain you to look down
So far from your father's house
And I know what a louse like me
In his house could do for you

[Verse 3]
I'm the cream
Of the great Utopia dream
And you're the gleam
In the depths of your banker's spleen

[Verse 4]
I'm a Phallus in pigtails
And there's blood on my nose
And my tissue is rotting
Where the rats chew my bones
And my eye socket's empty
See nothing but pain
I keep havin' this brainstorm
About twelve times a day

[Chorus 1]
So now, you could spend the morning walking with me
Quite amazed
As I am unwashed and somewhat slightly dazed

[Verse 5]
I've got eyes in my backside
That see electric tomatoes
On credit card rye bread
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a Queen
And my heads full of murders
Where only killers scream

[Chorus 2]
So now you could spend your morning talking with me
Quite amazed
Look out, I'm raving mad and somewhat slightly dazed

[Verse 6]
Now you run from your window
To the porcelain bowl
And you're sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor
And the Braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly
It's very catching

[Final Chorus 3]
So now, you should spend the morning, lying to your father
Quite amazed
About the strange unwashed and happily slightly dazed
I'm not following

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah
Don't sit down
Don't sit down
Don't sit down
Do-doo-doo doo-dah;
Do-do-doo-doo-dah-Dah
Dah-da-da-Da

Dah-doo-doo-doo
Dah-dah ...

The hand that wrote this letter
Sweeps the pillow clean
So rest your head
And read a treasured dream

I care for no one else but you
I tear my soul to cease the pain
I think maybe you feel the same
What can we do?

I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do
So I've been writing just for you

They say your life is going very well
They say you sparkle like a different girl
But something tells me that you hide
When all the world is warm and tired
You cry a little in the dark, well so do I

I'm not quite sure what you're supposed to say
But I can see it's not okay

He makes you laugh
He brings you out in style
He treats you well and
Makes you up real fine

And when he's strong
He's strong for you
And when you kiss it's something new
But did you ever call my name
Just by mistake?

I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do
So I'll just write some love to you

Do-do-Doo ...
Do, do-doo-doo-dooh:
Do, dah
Oh-oo-hoo-ooh-Oh

[Chorus 1]
I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you, I need to rest
Because it's you
That sets the test

[Verses 1]
So much has gone
And little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter
"I gave Them life
I gave Them all
They drained my very soul
...dry
I crushed my heart
To ease Their pains
No thought for me remains there
Nothing can They spare
What of me?
Who praised Their efforts
To be free?
Words of strength and care
And sympathy
I opened doors
That would have blocked Their way
I braved Their cause to guide
For little pay
I ravaged at my finance just for Those
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me

[Chorus 1]
I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you
That sets the test

[Verses 2]
So much has gone
And little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me
My friends talk
Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word
"We had a friend, a talking man
Who spoke of many powers that he had
Not of the best of men, but Ours
We used him
We let him use his powers
We let him fill Our needs
Now We are strong
And the road is coming to its end
Now the damned have no time to make amends
No purse of token fortune stands in Our way
The silent guns of love
Will blast the sky
We broke the ruptured structure built of age
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage
Where money stood
We planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers
Sons of dirt
Infiltrated business cesspools
Hating through Our sleeves
Yea, and We slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor
On slogans such as
Wish You Could Hear
Love Is All We Need
Kick Out The Jams
Kick Out Your Mother
Cut Up Your Friend
Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End
And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above
And We Can Force You to Be Free
And We Can Force You to Believe"
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
It said:
"I believe in the Power of Good
I Believe in the State of Love
I Will Fight For the Right to be Right
I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right"
And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain
On the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command
But not hearing anymore
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich
And I Want to Believe
In the madness that calls 'Now'
And I want to Believe
That a light's shining through
Somehow

[Bridge to Outro]
And I Want to Believe
And You Want to Believe
And We Want to Believe
And We Want to Live
Oh, We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live

[Outro]
Live
Live
Live!
Oh my love, Janine
I'm helpless for your smile
Like a Polish wanderer
I travel ever onwards to your land
And were it not just for the jewels
I’d close your hand

Your strange demand
To 'collocate' my mind
Scares me into gloom
You’re too intense
I'll have to keep you in your place
I've no defence
I've got to keep my veil on my face

[Chorus 1]
Janine, Janine
You'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face
Janine, Janine
You'd like to crash the walls
But if you take an axe to me
You’ll kill another man
Not me at all
You’re fey, Janine
A tripper to the last
But if I catch you standing on my toes
I'll have a right to shout you down
For you’re a lazy stream
In which my thoughts would drown

So stay, Janine
And we can glide along
I've caught your wings for laughs
I'm not obliged to read you statements of the year
So take your glasses off
And don't act so sincere

[Chorus 2 to Outro]
Janine, Janine
You’d like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face

Janine, Janine
You'd like to crash the walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all

[Outro instrumental and fade out:]
Yeah, oh!
Ooh ...

Janine
Hey! Janine

Janine
Oh hey Janine

Oh, Janine!?
Whoah-ooh

Oh, Janine, Janine, etc

[Verse 1]
I recall how we lived
On the corner of a bed
And we'd speak of a Swedish room
Of hessian and wood
And we'd talk with our eyes
Of the sweetness in our lives
And tomorrows of rich surprise...
Some things we could do

[Chorus]
In our madness
We burnt one hundred days
Time takes time to pass
And I still hold some ashes to me
An Occasional Dream

[Verse 2]
And we'd sleep, oh so close
But not really close our eyes
Between the sheets of summer
Bathed in blue...
Gently weeping nights
It was long, long ago
And I can't touch your name
For the days of fate
Were strong for you...
Danced you far from me

[Chorus]
In my madness
I see your face in mine
I keep a photograph
It burns my wall with time
Time
An Occasional Dream
Of mine
An Occasional Dream
Of mine
An Occasional Dream
Of mine

[Verse 1]
Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned
'Neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one

[Verse 2]
Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh, "It's the madness in his eyes"
As he breaks the night to cry:

[Verse 3]
It's really me
Really you and really me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really you and really Me
You'll lose me, though I'm always
Really free

[Verse 4]
And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realize
Where the snow had saved a place
For the Wild-Eyed Boy from Freecloud

[Verse 5]
And the village dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the Wild-Eyed Boy from Freecloud
And the women once proud clutched the heart of the crowd
As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand

[Verse 6]
And the Magic in the stare
Of the Wild Eyed Boy said
"Stop, Freecloud
They won't think to cut me down"
But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face
Of the Wise Boy
Came tumbling down
To the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peace/love
Stumbled back to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles
From the Freecloud mountain track
I took this walk to ease my mind
To find out what's gnawing at me
Wouldn't think
To look at me

That I've spent a lot of time in education
It all seems so long ago
I'm a thinker
Not a talker

I've no-one to talk to anyway

I can't see the road
For the rain in my eyes
Ahh-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah

I live above the grocer's store
Owned by an Austrian
He often calls me down
To eat
And he jokes about his broken English
Tries to be a friend to me
But for all my years of reading conversation

I stand without a word to say

I can't see the bridge
For the rain in my eyes
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah

And the world is full of life
Full of folk who don't know me
And they walk in twos or threes
Or more

While the lamp that shines above the grocers' store
Investigates my face
So rudely

And my essays lying scattered on the floor
Fulfill their needs just by being there
And my hands shake
My head hurts
My voice sticks
Inside my throat
I'm invisible and dumb
And no-one will recall me

And I can't see the water
For the tears in my eyes

[Intro]
I was walking through the counters of a national concern
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder

[Verse 1]
And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind

[Chorus 1]
Crying
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today

[Verse 2]
Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly
For her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling
Wooden floor

[Outro Chorus]
Crying
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way

[Intro]
Maybe I should announce it, should I?:
"Memory of a free festival"

[Verse 1]
The Children of the summer's end
Gathered in the dampened grass
We played Our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was God's land
It was ragged and naive
It was heaven

[Verse 2]
Touch, we touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't, but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day

[Verse 3]
Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the topest top of all the tops
That man has pushed beyond his brain
Satori must be something just the same

[Verse 4]
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes
And saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And We walked back to the road, unchained

[Outro]
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party

[Verse 1]
Dreaming about her
Dripping pendulum curls
That pull at your world
As your minds swim together
The dark of your night cannot douse out the light
That shines on the Heather

I melt at the sight that bleeds crude and divine
And spits life on the ashes
I'll take what I can before I wake up
Then I'll leave forever
It's a routine delay that I always replay
And place on display
It's my calling card when I'm falling apart

[Chorus]
I ain't gonna call you again
I ain't gonna call you again
I ain't gonna call you again
I ain't gonna call you again
I ain't gonna call you again
I ain't gonna call you again
I ain't gonna call you again
Again
Again
Again

[Verse 2]
Moonlight trickles through the shutters
Subtle dim-lit appeal
Flickers hints over contours
And leaves me in tatters
"I'll bare all the scars", the final remarks
Of a man at his limits
The sugared scent of desire, leaks fuel in the fire
And fogs up perceptions

Cue the hazy hum that grips at your lungs
Like it's begging you for something
To cave or remain the pristine young slave
To the draw of the lightning
It gets harder to shake
With no moves left to make

[Chorus]
I ain't gonna call you again
I ain't gonna call you again
I ain't gonna call you again
I ain't gonna call you again
I ain't gonna call you again
I ain't gonna call you again
I ain't gonna call you again
Again
Again
Again

[Hook: B.o.B.]
I used to dream (I used to dream) ohh-whoa (ohh!)
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I see (now I see) ohh-whoa! (ohh!)
Because I'm sittin on top of the world! (the whole world)
And now I see (ay) see (ay) see (ay) see (ay)
Cause I'm sittin on top of the world! (ay, ay, ay, ay)
And now I see (ay) see (ay) see (ay) see (ay)
Cause I'm sittin on top of the world! (ay, ay, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Man, I remember, 'fore I say that, wait, let me issue this statement
No way should reflection be mistaken for glorification
Now, I remember so vivid, me and my niggas was livin'
Sub-standard condition, still handling business
Still laughin' and trippin', still having the bitches
I'm rapping now, reminiscing, and goddamn it, we did it
From trappin', standin' & pitchin' with rich we stand in the kitchen
Splittin' it eight ways, flip it in eight days
Thought that wild and unruly was just the way to behave
Kept the weight and the yay', but most the paper we made
In all dimes, I ain't lyin, the pleasure was all mine
Had big work to move, but we served the small time
I always outshined the niggas with small minds
Who woulda thought we'd be arguably the greatest of all time
'Round here? we develop such a sound down here
Been duplicated often, still, can only be found here
Only listen to Gs, that other shit I don't hear
Shit, they so far in the rear, why would I even care?
I'm too busy a player, steering niggas careers
Been talkin 'bout it for years, and now we finally here

[Hook: B.o.B.]
I used to dream (I used to dream) ohh-whoa (ohh!)
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I see (now I see) ohh-whoa! (ohh!)
Because I'm sittin on top of the world! (the whole world)
And now I see (ay) see (ay) see (ay) see (ay)
Cause I'm sittin on top of the world! (ay, ay, ay, ay)
And now I see (ay) see (ay) see (ay) see (ay)
Cause I'm sittin on top of the world! (ay, ay, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ayo, I'm sitting on top of the, it's more than a feeling, ain't it?
I be killing, damn it, I'm illin', I'm illin', ay-ay-ay-ay
Meet Mr. Popular, go get your binoculars
And see "Penthouse 3" where a nigga be
Spitting fire on a PJ, in my PJs
Fire Marshall said I took it to the max like TJ
Y'all ain't peep, I said Marshall's, replay
I guess I'm like the black Marshall meets Jay
Meet 'Ye, alligator souffle, got it made
Special Ed got head from a girl in special ed
You know the pretty ones in that dumb class
But she got that dumb ass
Hit high school and got pregnant dumb fast
"What happened, Tisha? Your boyfriend come fast?"
Turn around, give me pound like we folks
"Hell no, I went raw, dawg, three strokes"

[Hook: B.o.B.]
I used to dream (I used to dream) ohh-whoa (ohh!)
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I see (now I see) ohh-whoa! (ohh!)
Because I'm sittin on top of the world! (the whole world)
And now I see (ay) see (ay) see (ay) see (ay)
Cause I'm sittin on top of the world! (ay, ay, ay, ay)
And now I see (ay) see (ay) see (ay) see (ay)
Cause I'm sittin on top of the world! (ay, ay, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I know them haters don't stop plottin' and wishin' we fall
Cause I'm standin' on top lookin' down at it all
I know from down there to y'all, it seems like I got it all
Homie, I ain't get enough, we still tryin' to triple up
That's why we got StreetCred and Akoo building up
Say I'm doing too much, shit I say I ain't did enough
Remember sayin', "Damn, if I could just get to a million plus"
And now I'm like, "Shit, what the fuck is a million bucks?"
Tripled that on my bond thanks to Biggs and Run
But never mind what I been through, just look at what I become
All this shit I've avoided, what I done for my sons
And daughters and momma, just call her, I sold dope
And dropped out of school, seems that's all they can see
They don't notice none of my family did that since me
I broke that cycle, now my family live a life of
Mandatory minimums, but not when the judge sentence 'em
Cousins in college, where you think they get tuition from?
Just from standin 'round wishin, huh?
And while you standing 'round lookin' dumb, I make it happen
Takin' action, over time, got damn good at it

[Hook: B.o.B]
I used to dream (I used to dream) ohh-whoa (ohh!)
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I see (now I see) ohh-whoa! (ohh!)
Because I'm sittin on top of the world! (the whole world)
And now I see (ay) see (ay) see (ay) see (ay)
Cause I'm sittin on top of the world! (ay, ay, ay, ay)
And now I see (ay) see (ay) see (ay) see (ay)
Cause I'm sittin on top of the world! (ay, ay, yeah, yeah)

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm sittin' in a car full of bitches
Makin' art with 'em, screamin', "Carpe diem"
This is mothafuckin' freedom, ain't it?
I came to free the nation
Do the macarena with a waitress at the Applebee's
Who'd rather be a cheetah, and
One day, I'ma be the greatest, retire my jersey
I'm the people's favorite; Y2K, Nelly, Dream Land, Kirby
Have 'em bow down, how the ground sound? Dirty
I'm way beyond okay, these hoes ain't
Worthy of the nut-bust
Up-chuck flows when I'm fucked up
You want a war? Bitch, I'm Chuck Norris with the nunchucks
Lord of all this funk stuff, somethin' like a oracle, I gotchu
It's kung-fu Keanu, I'm the one, what?
Droppin' like dump trucks, made it through the sadness
What does everybody run from? You marchin' through the madness
I'ma kidnap the rap game, hold the bitch captive
Full of so much regret, I should've been a Catholic
Jewish, Buda, Baptist, cooler than a cactus
You sleepin' on my shit, then I'ma dookie on your mattress
Whoa, and that smell like roses
Just got myself back, run and tell that, homie

[Chorus]
It's only me, myself, and I
That's all I need though
Dreamt I would teach myself to fly
It was just a dream though
When I am all alone, I close my eyes
Turn on the music, blow my mind
Ooh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
(Yeah) Okay
And in my mind, I'm enormous
Like a giant rhino-saurus or a dinosaur of violent forces
Eyes in the sky, can't find the floor, I'm kinda sorta (Crazy)
The medication got me feelin' all (Wavy)
Yeah, I'm chasin' paper like I'm broke
Never cater to these hoes, the creator of this dope shit
Got my own chef, plus a waiter and a hostess
Hot as the equator, but I'm rarer than the solstice
Don't trip, breath of fresh air if you want it
They always starin' at me kinda like they seen a ghost
Knock 'em out, T-K-O
Gettin' money is the motive and the pussy just a bonus
Flows is explosive, make a girl sweat like aerobics
Yoga, fuckin' king cobra, boa
Constrict no bitch, don't even know her
Belushi in a toga, house full of animals, Jedi, Yoda
Everybody wanna grow up and be Hova
I'd rather be Darwin, Clark Kent
New G-Wagon with the dark tint
Came a long way from sellin' dubs by the park bench
Now we can celebrate, I want this shit forever, mane

[Chorus]
It's only me, myself, and I
That's all I need though
Dreamt I would teach myself to fly
It was just a dream though
When I am all alone, I close my eyes
Turn on the music, blow my mind
Ooh-oh-oh

[Outro]
The music, I can fix you with the music
Do you feel what's in the music?
People need to hear the music, the music
The music, I can fix you with the music
Do you feel what's in the music?
The people need to hear the music, the music

[Intro]
Work it, make it
Do it, makes us

Hour, never
Ever, after

Work it, make it

More than ever, hour after hour
Work is never over

[Verse 1]
Spiders are singing in the salty breeze
Spiders are filling out tax returns
Spinning out webs of deductions and melodies
On a private beach in Michigan

[Verse 2]
Why can't we wish their kisses good
Why do they miss when their kisses should
Fly like winging birds fighting for the keys
On a private beach in Michigan

[Chorus 1]
This recent rash of kidsmoke
All these telescopic poems
It's good to be alone

[Verse 3]
Why can't they say what they want
Why can't they just say what they need
Come clean, listen and talk
Hello private caller, I.D. blocked

[Verse 4]
The sun will rise, we'll climb into cars
The future has a valley and a shortcut around
Who will wear the crown of drowning award
Hold a private light on the Michigan shore

[Chorus 2]
Fool me with a kiss of kidsmoke
From a microscopic home
It's good to be alone

[Bridge]
I'll be in my bed
You can be the stone
That raises from the dead
And carries us all home
There's no blood on my hands
I just do as I am told

[Intro: 070 Shake]
Fallin', dreamin', talkin' in your sleep
I know you want to cry all night, all night
Plottin', schemin', findin'
Reason to defend all of your violent nights
Promise me you will see

[Chorus: 070 Shake with Ty Dolla $ign]
Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night)
They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off

[Verse: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Couldn't kill me if you tried, couldn't kill me if I died
I'm gon' always be alive, you were always in denial
Heard your song, you stole my vibe, so I brought back my old vibe
Funny every time you lied, how that turned into more lies
I'm too nice to all my dawgs, stand by me when I go wrong
Please don't love me for the stuff like you never did nothing wrong
Why did you do something to me?
Man, I'm still mad at my dad, uh
I fucked that bitch, she was bad, I fucked that bitch, on the rag
Years ago, might get physical
Might get something, might digital
Life do something like digital, all romance got digital
How low something? Life critical
And this conversation critical and I'm something so pitiful
Why you standing, looking so pitiful?
Don't you know that you are beautiful?
Everything 'bout you beautiful
Everything 'bout you beautiful
That was without you, new to them
We can do it now, what you do to them?
Maybe the- maybe the world will be without me
Maybe we sleep with- sleep without me
Maybe life signs off, days was cloudy
Maybe God, dun-dun, signing off 

[?]
Down for life, still ashamed
August Ames, all the same
All the pain, all the lames and all the lames live the thing
Everything, everything

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
There's been a lot of change in our lives
Some would've guessed and some undefined
Must keep the faith in, faith in each other
You are my brother, family

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Writin's on the wall around us (yeah-yeah)
Watchin' people all around us (yeah)
Gotta wake up to the call above us (Ooh-ooh-oh)
Then I know it's gon' be alright (Yeah-yeah)
It's comin' around, we're enlightened
Prayin' that we all stay guided
Some way, somehow (Ooh-ohh)
We'll find our way

[Verse 2: Ant Clemons]
We will weld this world, world back together
Let's make a way, we'll lead the way (Must)
Must keep the faith, faith in each other
You are my brother, family

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Ant Clemons]
Writin's on the wall around us
Watchin' people all around us
Gotta wake up to the call above us
Then I know it's gonna be alright
It's comin' back around, we're enlightened
Prayin' that we all stay guided
Some way, somehow (Ooh-ohh)
We'll find a way
Hey (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
We'll find a way
Some way, somehow (Ooh-ohh)
We'll find a way, we'll find a way

[Verse 3: Teyana Taylor and The-Dream]
We'll find our way like summer flows its way through fall
Allow love to wrap its wings around us all
Daylight
In the nighttime, don't cry yourself to sleep
I will be your everything
Stay patiently waiting for me (for me)
Let the harmony between you and I
Completely make us whole (make us whole)
Let me know (me know)
That you and I see the same picture (picture)
In that frame, with ya (with ya)
Thrill is gone
Thrill is gone away
Thrill is gone, baby

Thrill is gone away
You know you done me wrong, baby
You'll be sorry
Someday

Thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away from me
Thrill is gone, baby
The thrill is gone away from me
Although I'll still live on, baby
But so lonely
I'll be

Thrill is gone
Thrill is gone away for good
Oh, the thrill has gone, baby
Gone away for good
Someday I know I'll be open armed, baby
Just like I know
I know I should

I'm free now, baby
I'm free from your spell
Free, free, free now, baby
Baby, I'm free from your spell
Now that it's all over
All I can do
Is wish you well

Thrill is gone
Gone away for good
The thrill has gone, baby
The thrill is gone away for good
Oh you've done me wrong baby
You'll be sorry someday
Thrill is gone
Free from your spell
I'm free
I Said If You Ever Change Your Mind
About Leaving, Leaving Me Behind
O-o-h, Bring It to Me
Bring Your Sweet Lovin'
Bring It on Home to Me

[Bring It on Home to Me]

You know I tried, to treat you right
Oh but you stayed out, stayed out late at night
O-o-h, Bring It to Me
Bring Your Sweet Loving
Bring It on Home to Me

[Bring It on Home to Me]

------ Guitar and Piano Solos ------

I Said If You Ever Change Your Mind
About Leaving, Leaving Me Behind
O-o-h, Bring It to Me
Bring Your Sweet Lovin’
Bring It on Home to Me

[Bring It on Home to Me]
You act like you don't want to listen
When I'm talking to you
You think you outta do baby
Anything you want to do
You gotta be crazy baby
You just gotta be outta your mind
As long as I'm payin' the bills
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss

I'll drink if I wanna
And play a little poker too
Don't you say nothing to me
As long as I'm taking care of you
As long as I'm workin baby
And payin' all the bills
I don't want no mouth from you
About the way I'm supposed to live

Gotta be crazy baby
Just gotta be outta your mind
As long as I’m payin’ the bills
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss
Now that you got me
You act like you ashamed
You don't act like my baby
You just usin' my name
But I tell ya I'm going to hell with money
And I don't want no back-talk
If you don't like what I'm doin' baby
Pick up your things and walk
You gotta be crazy baby
Just gotta be out of your mind
Long as I'm payin' the bills
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss

[Verse 1]
Don't say you love me 'cause I can't say it back
Don't say you're sorry 'cause you've done nothing bad
Swallow my feelings, but won't swallow my pride
You know I've got a suit of armor on, you'll never see me cry
I hate the silence (Ah-ah), that's why the music's always loud
So many problems (Ah-ah), I try to drown 'em out
1000 bottles (Ah-ah), collecting souvenirs
You know it's so hard to admit it
But the only good inside of me is you

[Pre-Chorus]
I take all of these blue and yellow pills
But nothing seems to last like you
You're chasing after something that you'll never catch
Woah

[Chorus]
Like a white Mercedes, always been running too fast
When your heart is breaking, you keep on taking me back

[Post-Chorus]
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love
One day I'll pull through and I'll be good enough
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love
Oh, your love, yeah
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love
One day I'll pull through and I'll be good enough
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love
'Cause I don't deserve you

[Verse 2]
You're so forgiving (Ah-ah), my friends think you're the best
From the beginning (Ah-ah), your friends said it wouldn't last
But this connection (Ah-ah), it's something they don't see
You know it's so hard to admit it
But the best damn part of me was always you

[Pre-Chorus]
I take all of these blue and yellow pills
But nothing seems to last like you
You're chasing after something that you'll never catch
Woah

[Chorus]
Like a white Mercedes, always been running too fast
When your heart is breaking, you keep on taking me back
Hate myself, I really love you
Hurting you feels like I'm hurting as well
All I know is, all I know is, all I know is I don't deserve you

[Post-Chorus]
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love
One day I'll pull through and I'll be good enough
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love
Oh, your love, yeah
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love
One day I'll pull through and I'll be good enough
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love
'Cause I don't deserve you

[Intro]
That's that Cudi beat, you know what I'm sayin'?
Y'all, I'm just waiting for God

[Chorus]
I'ma wait for God
I'ma wait for God
Been too long away from God
I'll wait for God

[Bridge]
Like water be the path, go take the path of least resistance
Don't force nothin', it's the way
Power versus force
I'ma wait for God
Been too long away from God
I'll wait for God, we'll wait

[Verse 1]
Yo, know I'm sayin'?
People try to rush things
Or manipulate, or strategize, or think they're gon' set up plays
Man makes plans, God laughs
He got good ass sense of humor, know what I'm sayin'?
I was just livin' my life
Spent all of my tour money on this, big mansion 'n' shit
Biggest house in Hidden Hills
He funny though
He gon' move the number one rapper four blocks down the street from me
You funny, God
Heheheh

[Chorus]
Mm, I'ma wait for God
Been too long away from God
Been too long away from God
Ooh, I will wait for God

[Verse 2]
Wait, wait, wait wait wait
Only with his blessings, only
In his time and God willing
Shall it happen
Ya know, people go through pain 'n' shit
You need some time to just walk it off, it's like a sprained ankle
You can't get right to it, know what I'm sayin'?
It's like a basketball game, pain
The way we feel about things, mm, mm, mm
If someone say
We-we say, we hoopin' and stuff, you sprain your ankle
The whole team, can't come to it and say, "I'm sorry," and it's just gonna feel better
Or you can't scream at it and it's just gon' feel better
You've gotta take time for that to heal
And maybe you need to stay of off it a little bit
Stay off the subject
Heh huh

[Chorus]
I'ma wait for God
Eh-na, when it happen
Oh, I'ma wait for God

[Verse 3]
It's so funny
I was goin' to Denny's the other day
Lenny's, Denny's
And, I was, ya know, in Westwood
And I seen
A-A tall, light-skinned dude with a beard and shit
I said, "That look like Drake, right there"
But he was like on a skateboard
I said, "I know that ain't gon' be Drake on a skateboard"
Heheheheh, heh
I was like, "Man, I'ma go talk to him, right now!"
So I-I pulled to turn the car around
It's- I swear he looked just like-
He definitely brought beards for light-skinned niggas back in style and shit, like, hehehe
I said on my first album, I'ma make sure light-skinned niggas never come back in style, heheheh

[Chorus]
Oh, I'ma wait for God
Oh, I'ma wait for God
Oh, I'ma wait for God

[Outro]
Spent too long a summer away from God, though I
I might blast off, off into the light, oh
I don't 

[?] never, never a job though
I could not create for what, the Stylo
Bored a lot
And I put that on Chicago
Yeah, I put that on Chicago
I put that on Chicago
North, Saint, and Chicago

[Verse 1]
I'd work for you, slave for you
I'd even be a beggar or a knave for you
If that isn't love, it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along
I'd gladly, I'd gladly, I'd gladly move the earth for you
Oh, just to prove my love and its worth for you
Now, if that isn't love, it'll just have to do
Until the real thing comes along

[Bridge]
With all the words, dear, at my command
I just can't sing to make you understand
I'll always love you, darling, come what may
My heart is yours, what more can I say?

[Verse 2]
I'd sigh, I'd sigh for you, I'd even cry for you
I'd reach out and even tear the stars out of the skies for you
Now if that isn't love, it'll just have to do
Until the real thing comes along

[Outro]
Until the real thing comes along

Countin' all my blessings, and count my dollars
Make it all back 'til tomorrow, I'll tell you how, bruh
If you see me at the bar don't take a half a hour
And I kill my many mans on my daily shower
Now they wonder why I'm trippin', I'll tell you now, bruh
Got my homie on the corner, and he pushin' sour
If you see me on the low, don’t take me out, bruh
If you keep it on the low I show you how it works
Show you how, I show you–

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Wonder what you want right now, wonder what you want right now
(Yeah yeah-eah, yeah-yeah-eah, yeah, yeah)
Used to be 'bout it-'bout it, used to be 'bout it-'bout it

Wonder what you want right now, wonder what you want right now
(Yeah yeah-eah, yeah-yeah-eah, yeah, yeah)
Used to be 'bout it-'bout it, used to be 'bout it-'bout it
(Yeah yeah-eah, yeah-yeah-eah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Hands up far from (....)
Said I wouldn't let you see past 21 up
Said I'd be goin' 'cause I came from the same slum
Don't know where I came from
She probably wondering how
Is this your turn
Stains me now and move the crowd
Mama ain't raise no fool
My mine's  a diamond
I'm from the city of jewels

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean]
Refugee from Haiti
Flatboys to New Jersey
Then I got with Fugees
Now I'm with Avicii
Raised in them tenements
Speak for those less fortunate
Then I ran for president
Hands up if you with me

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean & ?]
Put your hands all the way up
All the way up
Put your hands all the way up
All the way up
Put your hands all the way up
All the way up
Put your hands all the way up
All the way up

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
Papa was a dishwasher
The peer pressure got me selling cocaina
One brick, two brick, three brick, four
I could have been the one boys came for
But now all we did is encores on tours
Brooklyn, Sweden to Istanbul
Life's a carnival, use my music
Or I sellout to blow and I pray for my rivals

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean]
Refugee from Haiti
Flatboys to New Jersey
Then I got w
