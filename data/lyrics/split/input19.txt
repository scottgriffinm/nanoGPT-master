[Verse 1]
I heard the truth was built to bend
A mechanism to suspend
The guilt is what you will require
And still you've got to dance little liar
Just like those fibs to pop and fizz
And you'll be forced to take that awful quiz
And you're bound to trip
And she'll detect the fiction on your lips and dig a contradiction up

[Chorus]
And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt beneath the dirt
The liar takes a lot less time

[Verse 2]
I'm sure it's clear and plain to read
It's not an alibi you need just yet
Oh, no, it's something for those beads of sweat
Yes, that will get you back to normal
And after you have dabbed the patch
You'll breathe and then proceed to scratch
The varnish off that newly added calmness
So as not to raise any alarms too soon

[Chorus]
And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt beneath the dirt

[Bridge]
The liar takes a lot less time to decide on the saunter
Have you got itchy bones? And in all your time alone
Can you hack your mind being riddled
With the wrong memories?

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt between the dirt

[Verse 1]
You push me
I don't have the strength to
Resist or control you
To take me down, take me down
You hurt me
But do I deserve this?
You make me so nervous
Calm me down, calm me down

[Chorus]
Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh

[Verse 2]
So come here
And never leave this place
Perfection of your face
Slows me down, slows me down
So fall down
I need you to trust me
Go easy, don't rush me
Help me out, why don't you help me out?

[Chorus]
Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh
So you say, "Go, it isn't working"
And I say, "No, it isn't perfect"
So I stay instead
I'm never gonna leave this bed

[Bridge]
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
I'd give it all away just to get you back
And fake it, fake it all
Take what I can get
Knockin' so loud, can you hear me yet?
Try to stay awake, but you can't forget

[Chorus]
Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh
So you say, "Go, it isn't working"
And I say, "No, it isn't perfect"
So I stay instead
I'm never gonna leave this bed, ooh

[Outro]
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have

[Verse 1]
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do

[Verse 2]
Walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

[Chorus]
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again

[Verse 3]
You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

[Chorus]
But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I want to talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

[Chorus]
'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again

[Outro]
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again

[Verse 1]
Outside the cafe by the cracker factory
You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude as you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick and mix
Said, "You're mistaken if you're thinking
That I haven't been called cold before"
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
It's all you had left and it was going to waste

[Chorus]
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the ice-cream man
On rainy afternoons

[Verse 2]
The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on its way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne
With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

[Chorus]
And your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons
Uninviting, but not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are
Crying Lightning

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called
Crying Lightning, Crying Lightning
Crying Lightning, Crying Lightning
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called Crying

[Verse 1]
You made my soul a burning fire
You're getting to be my one desire
You're getting to be all that matters to me
And let me tell you girl
I hope and pray each day I live
A little more love I'll have to give
A little more love that's devoted and true
Cause all I do is think about you

[Hook]
All I do, is think about you (thinking about you, baby)
All I do, is think about you

[Verse 2]
Baby just suppose I should happen to cross your mind
And by some chance a boy like me you're really been trying to find
Well let me tell you girl
Think of how exciting it would be
If you should discover you feel like me
If you should discover this dream is for two
We'll I'm gonna tell you girl
I'd light a candle every day
And pray that you'll always feel this way
And pray that our love will forever be new
Cause all I do is think about you

[Hook]
All I do, is think about you (I think about you)
All I do, is think about you

[Verse 3]
Gonna tell you girl
I'd light a candle every day
And pray that you'll always feel this way
And pray that our love will forever be new
I'm gonna tell you girl
If I cannot have you for my own
I'd rather be lonely and all alone
I'd rather keep thinking the way that I do
Cause all I do is think about you

[Hook]
All I do, is think about you
All I do, is think about you
(Think about you baby)
All I do, is think about you
(Think about you baby)
All I do, is think about you
(All I do, is think about you baby)
All I do, is think about you
(Think about you baby)
All I do, is think about you
(Baby, baby)

[Bridge]
I'm thinking baby, 'bout you baby
I'm thinking baby, 'bout you baby
I'm thinking baby, 'give it to me baby
I'm thinking baby, 'bout you baby

[Hook]
All I do, is think about you
All I do, is think about you
(Think about you baby)

[Ad-libs]
All I do, is think about you
Can't you feel the fire burning?
Can't you feel the birds humming? (All I do, is think about you)
Can't you feel my love flowing? (All I do, is think about you)
Can't you see my love growing?
All I do, is think about you

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Sometimes, I need to remember just to breathe
Sometimes, I need you to stay away from me
Sometimes, I'm in disbelief, I didn't know
Somehow, I need you to go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington,  Mike Shinoda & Both]
(Don't stay) Forget our memories, forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
Just give me myself back and don't stay
Forget our memories, forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
Just give me myself back and don't stay

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Sometimes, I feel like I trusted you too well
Sometimes, I just feel like screaming at myself
Sometimes, I'm in disbelief, I didn't know
Somehow, I need to be alone

[Chorus: Chester Bennington,  Mike Shinoda & Both]
(Don't stay) Forget our memories, forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
Just give me myself back and don't stay
Forget our memories, forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
Just give me myself back and don't stay

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I don't need you anymore
I don't want to be ignored
I don't need one more day
Of you wasting me away
I don't need you anymore
I don't want to be ignored
I don't need one more day
Of you wasting me away
With no apologies

[Chorus: Chester Bennington,  Mike Shinoda & Both]
(Don't stay) Forget our memories, forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
Just give me myself back and don't stay
Forget our memories, forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
Just give me myself back and don't stay

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
Don't stay
Don't stay!

[Verse 1]
We try, we try to please you
And it's never enough, it's never enough
If I, If I had my way
I might have given it up, given it up
I’ve got so much on my plate right now
Aaaa, do you understand? Do you understand?

[Hook]
Just give it time, just give it time
Just give it time, just give it time
Just give it time, just give it time
Just give it time, just give it time

[Verse 2]
So you say you're tired
'Bout the same old song
But here I am working
Damn he's taking too long
Hey, I do it all for you (Da da da da da)

[Hook]
Just give it time, just give it time
Just give it time, just give it time
Just give it time, just give it time
Just give it time, just give it time

[Bridge/Outro]
It seems we've been gone
Gone for so long
I gave you all my energy
Thankful for your faith in me
But why don't you just have some patience?
This so hard to find
Why we leave from you is the
Baby, love's been on my mind
So please let me breathe
I need air
Where's the trees?

[Hook]
Don't mess with Mr. T
Don't mess with Mr. T

Temptation...

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Man I try I tried and I tried again
But the weed and the hoes the Coke and the Hen
All seem to know that I'm gon' give in
If my girl find out — one more 'gain
That I'm 'nikcuf around through her or her friends (what?)
Then she gon' leave like leaves in the winter
Meaning she cold
She hear about me and the twins that had on the twin skirts
Hit squirt hit the purp
And that bitch had the nerve to call out my name when my girl hit my chirp
"Hello?" Oh — that's just my cousin Kim
Her and her friends stopped by for a min
"Nigga, you over there lying AGAIN?!"
Damn. I know she ain't finna believe
She's fixing to leave
Cause Mr. T

Don't mess with Mr. T

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I'm at home where the drama is grown as hell
And I'm still in my mama crib, ain't on no scholar shit
So it's no scholarships, man
But I do want some Prada shit, damn
That's when one of my mans
Came at me with an ounce of that yanz
Like "That's 'bout a grand"
But then I remember Mom telling me
Don't be on no corner retailing weed
Ecstasy or whatever it be
Cause that life ain't straight, like L and B
Hard-headed like working at factories
Cause I got in the game like athletes
And a nigga got paid (paid)
'Til the police took away (way) me
Now I'm in the correctional facility
Mama missing me
Cause Mr. T

[Hook]
Don't mess with Mr. T
Don't mess with Mr. T

You catch me swervin' all on your side of town bumpin' "Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe"
Don't blow my high, just blow my cock, I'm so paid, I'm so fly
Your baby daddy disrespect me, black his eye, that's no lie

You want trouble I got plenty, how you want it full or semi

Surrounded by so many women one of these hoes might be your wife
She lookin' for a nigga that's ballin' so tonight might be her night
You know me I stay stuntin', lowkey I threw tuition at Onyx
Flip money fast like Sonic, rich nigga I speak ebonics
Got a new car I paid cash, got a new crib with a weed lab
Crisp bills I need that, fuck your team where the freaks at
Hundred deep in V.I.P., niggas always hatin'

[Verse 1]
Gargoyles standing at the front of your gate
Trying to tell me to wait, but I can't wait to see you
So I run like I'm mad to heaven's door
I don't wanna be bad, I won't cheat you no more

[Chorus]
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see, late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby

[Verse 2]
Spotlight, bad baby, you've got a flair
For the violentest kind of love anywhere out there
Mon amour, sweet child of mine, you're divine
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's okay to shine?

[Chorus]
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see, late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby

[Bridge]
Don't be afraid of me
Don't be ashamed
Walk in the way of my soft resurrection
Idol of roses, iconic soul
I know your name
Lead me to war with your brilliant direction

[Chorus]
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see, late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby

[Chorus]
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Grenadine, sunshine—can you break this heart of mine?
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby

[Intro: Michael Jackson & Kanye West]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Hey
Yeah, uh
Uh, uh

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
For 40 days and for 40 nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
Do think twice
(Do think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced 'till three
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried
His eyes looked like mine
Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do cause the lie becomes the truth
Hey

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son, oh, oh

[Outro: Michael Jackson & Kanye West]
Woah, woah
Uh uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, number one
Woah
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean... Billie Jean...
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean...

[Verse 1]
Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
Of making up the past
And feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt her figure before

[Verse 2]
A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back, oh

[Chorus]
You can find him sitting on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life

[Verse 3]
Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through

[Bridge]
There's no way I could describe him
What I've said is just what I'm hoping for

[Chorus]
But I will find him sitting on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for life

[Verse 1]
Tuesday heartbreak seem to be unfair
'Cause you say that you found another man
Tuesday break heart, guess you just don't care
'Cause you found you another man

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I want to be with you when you're all alone
I want to be with you
When you feel you got another man
You see, baby, it's all alright

[Chorus 1]
I wanna be with you when the nightime comes
I wanna be with you when the daytime comes
I wanna stay, oh baby, lemme, baby with you

[Verse 2]
Tuesday heartbreak seem to be a drag
When you know that you love her especially
Catch up baby, catch up with my dreams
Maybe then I can see you all the time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I wanna be with you when the nightime comes
I wanna be with you when the daytime comes
I wanna stay and never go away
Oh baby, it's alright

[Chorus 2]
I wanna be with you when the nightime comes
I wanna stay with you till the morning runs
I wanna, baby, baby, baby, it's alright

[Outro]
I wanna be with you when the nightime comes
I wanna be with you till the daytime comes
I wannsa stay, oh baby, get away, it's alright

[Verse 1]
You are natural sweet not just beautiful 'cause you follow your heart
It makes it even more special that you don't know how damn lovely you are
I would kiss the mirror every single day, if I wake up with your face
What are all these doubts for spinning in your head? Don't you look so sad

[Chorus]
Won't you come right here? Set the mind off you
Nobody, nobody, nobody's perfect but you, yeah
You mean the world to me, I can't believe you're true
'Cause nobody, nobody, nobody's perfect but you, you, you
It's just you, you, you

[Post-Chorus]
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody's perfect but you

[Verse 2]
When you stand close to me I get paralyzed, I forget how to breathe
Every place is forsaken and feels so wrong, every time that you leave
You catch me when I'm falling, you bring me back to life, when I'm dying in your eyes
Now what are all these doubts for spinning in your head? Don't you look so sad

[Chorus]
Won't you come right here? Set the mind off you
Nobody, nobody, nobody's perfect but you yeah
You mean the world to me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
'Cause nobody, nobody, nobody's perfect but you, you, you
It's just you, you, you (Party)

[Post-Chorus]
(Dance)
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody's perfect but you

[Chorus]
Yeah, you mean the world to me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Nobody, nobody, nobody's perfect but you, you, you, you, you, you
Won't you come right here? Set the mind off you
Nobody, nobody, nobody's perfect but you, yeah
You mean the world to me, I can't believe you're true
'Cause nobody, nobody, nobody's perfect but you, you, you
It's just you, you, you (Party)

[Verse 1]
Play house, put my favorite record on
Get down, get your crystal method on
You were like tall, tan, driving 'round the city
Flirtin' with the girls like you're so pretty
"Springsteen is the King, don't ya think?"
I was like, "Hell yeah, that guy can sing"
Like ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child
Your skin so golden brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Drive fast, I can almost taste it now
L.A., I don't even have to fake it now
You were like so sick, everybody said it
You were way ahead of the trend, get, get it
"Elvis is the best, hell yes"
"Honey, put on that party dress"
Like ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child
Your skin so golden brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
Everybody wants to go fast
But they can't compare
I don't really want the rest
Only you can take me there
I don't even know what I'm saying
But I'm praying for you

[Chorus]
You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child
Your skin so golden brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Outro]
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Like an American

[Verse 1]
My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
My eyes are wide like cherry pies
I gots a taste for men who are older
It's always been so it's no surprise

[Pre-Chorus]
Harvey's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy
(I come alive, alive)
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

[Post-Chorus]
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Oh, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
I fall asleep in an American flag
I wear my diamonds on Skid Row
I pledge allegiance to my dad
For teaching me everything he knows

[Pre-Chorus]
Harvey's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy
(I come alive, alive)
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

[Bridge]
Drugs, suck it up, like vanilla icys
Don't treat me rough, treat me really niceys
Decorate my neck, diamantes ices
Why, come on, come on
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh yeah)

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

[Outro]
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Oh, oh
My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
Ooh, ahh
My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
Ooh, oh yeah

It's the mothafuckin' Farm Club
This little girl 'bout to get her arm rubbed
Who wanna see me on this mothafuckin' mixing board?
Who wanna see me on a mothafuckin' diction lore?

But now, I'm Jack Nicholson
'Cause I'm shining on you niggas

[Verse 1]
Elvis is my daddy
Marilyn's my mother
Jesus is my bestest friend
We don't need nobody
'Cause we got each other
Or at least I pretend

[Pre-Chorus]
We get down every Friday night
Dancing and grinding in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry
We're feeling alright
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind
(I said, "Don't worry 'bout it")

[Chorus]
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric, baby

Sing that body electric

Diamonds are my bestest friend
Heaven is my baby
Suicide's her father
Opulence is the end

[Pre-Chorus]
We get down every Friday night
Dancing and grinding in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry
We're feeling alright
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind
(I said, "Don't worry 'bout it")

Grand Ole Opry

L.A., L.A.​

[Verse 1]
In the land of gods and monsters
I was an angel living in the garden of evil
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed
Shining like a fiery beacon

[Pre-Chorus]
You got that medicine I need
Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly
Me and God, we don't get along, so now I sing

[Chorus]
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is﻿ Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost, innocence lost

[Verse 2]
In the land of gods and monsters
I was an angel looking to get fucked hard
Like a groupie incognito, posing as a real singer
Life imitates art

[Pre-Chorus]
You got that medicine I need
Dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart, please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said, "Baby, that's alright with me"

[Chorus]
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is﻿ Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost, innocence lost

[Bridge]
When you talk, it's like a movie and you're makin' me crazy
'Cause life imitates art
If I get a little prettier, can I be your baby?
You tell me life isn't that hard

[Chorus]
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is﻿ Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost, innocence lost

[Freestyle: Frank Ocean]
I didn't think even think about this shit
But your bitch finna get a mink about this shit
You know what I'm saying I'm on Fifth and Broadway in this bitch
And now I'm at New York with my clip on my wrist
Yeah, nigga it's twelve on my wrist and twenty on my neck bitch
Yeah, you know what I'm saying, it's really nothing
And I really got the bars going, really nothing
And Basedgod ain't this fucking based
And get this camera out my fucking face

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Ecstasy in the air
I don't care
Can't tell me nothing
I'm impaired
No worse for wear

[Chorus: Rihanna & Kanye West]
'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb

'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I'm plastered (dry wall)
Look me in my (eyeball)

I love the way you lie girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come here dear
I'm tryna get closer to you
I'm motionin' you to pull over, boo
I'm the siren that you hear (hear)
I'm the butt police and I'm lookin' at your rear, rear, rear
But odds are I'ma end up in the back of a squad car
By the end of tonight, I'm a rock star
Get your wind up, it's attack of the oddball
Homie can you show me where the gosh darn bath salts are
'Cause I'm sick of sniffin' asphalt
Every thought scarred got my pants off at the crosswalk
In suspenders and I can't feel my lips 'cause—

[Chorus: Rihanna & Kanye West]
'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going

[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Aye Scream, time to turn up my nigga

It time to turn up, it time to go crazy out here man
You know what I'm talkin' bout?

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
It's low down Gucci, steal ya bomb Gucci
Remember when I used to drive an old ass hooptie (fuck it)
Gas packed shawty, dirty cup shawty
And why they call it Mountain Park
It ain't no God damn mountain
I was raised in sun valley wasn't a damn thing sunny
And I can't lie I try to serve every God damn junkie
Smoking gas and drinking mud but you can keep your Budweiser
She's a blunt begging bitch so I don't wanna stand by her
If you pour your ounces up then I don't wanna drink with ya
If you ain't gettin' money I don't wanna link with ya
I bring the pot to the water I could kitchen sink with ya
I had to kick you out the squad, you was the weakest link nigga

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Gas, gas, you know I got the gas
93 octane, 4 thousand for a bag
Gas, gas, sell it really fast
The pack just came in, you know this shit the gas
Mud, mud, gotta keep it mud
800 a pint nigga, I can't show you love
Mud, mud, you know I'm drinking mud
I might pour up the whole pint, cause I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
All this mud drinkin' Bud stinkin', walkin' 'round the club nigga
I'm a drug dealer, real killer, mean mugging fuck niggas
I hope you looking for me nigga I'm the one that shot your truck nigga
And if you really wanna go to war then I don't give a fuck nigga
Got em Bentley with the paper tag, book bag full of gas
Pockets can't hold on all the cash, I can loan your ass some swag
And I pull that pistol fast PRPs hang off my ass
You save your money, buy the Jag' but bitch I could go buy a jet
Remember 1996, the year that I robbed my connect
I wasn't even 20 yet, I-20 with 20 bricks
I done did all kind of shit, ya'll niggas just full of shit
I just drunk two pints today tryna drink the pain away

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Gas, gas, you know I got the gas
93 octane, 4 thousand for a bag
Gas, gas, sell it really fast
The pack just came in, you know this shit the gas
Mud, mud, gotta keep it mud
800 a pint nigga, I can't show you love
Mud, mud, you know I'm drinking mud
I might pour the whole pint, cause I don't give a fuck

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Love drankin' dirty, woke up really late
I used to drank up early, I like the way it taste
Drinkin' on this Actavis, I love to drank the grace
They catch you with these pints my nigga you might catch a case
Flossin' tossin' up, proceed with caution
I'm the boss and I ain't takin no losses
Smoking gas, and I'm sippin' on poison
Pull the arm and I'm a hit my target
Caught a body but I beat my charges
Two Ferraris I got twin horses
New charger and I sat it on forges
G5 touchdown on Moreland
Poppin' pills like I hear voices
Me and Scooter just brought twin Porsches
Louboutins, but I wear em like forces
Burberry, my boxer shorts is
Louie V this where my shorts is
Sun valley that's where my heart is
26s so I'm sittin' real high, ride in the sky same place my lord is

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Gas, gas, you know I got the gas
93 octane, 4 thousand for a bag
Gas, gas, sell it really fast

Mud, mud, you know I'm drinking mud

[Intro]
It's like whatever I do (Ooh)
Just can't get through to you (Ooh, ooh)
I'm never gonna tell nothing wrong (Ooh, ooh)
Listen (ooh)

[Verse 1]
Now, now she loved me, shawty, I loved her
Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out
Used to care, she used to share
The love that she used to give me can't be found
I lost my way, she said she'd stay
And lately, I've been sleeping with a ghost
My stock is down and out, I used to be worth my weight in gold
That was before a great depression kicked in and rocked us
And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us
I told you to leave, but you lied to me when you said that
"Baby, no worries, I promise to get us back"

[Chorus]
I know sorries just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated
I'm trying to travel through
But it's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains, hey
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
And the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
It's like moving mountains... (Moving mountains)
It's like moving mountains... (Moving mountains)
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Ooh, ooh
Be, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Verse 2]
She, she don't touch me, I don't touch her
We rarely even ever say a word
I really want to give her everything she deserves
But the bad took away the good
She thinks that I'm full of it, arguments
Always pissed, man I'm tired
Every kiss that I miss
Girl, you know I'm trying
You never believe when I say
And I never believe it when you say
"I love you", and I shouldn't complain about it
I should take it like a man and walk up out it
'Cause we will never be the same, ooh
I've been standing in gas and you have been the flame

[Chorus]
I know sorries just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated
I'm trying to get through
But it's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains, hey
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
And the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
It's like moving mountains... (Moving mountains)
It's like moving mountains... (Moving mountains)
Baby, why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?

[Bridge]
This must be a slow death that I'm traveling on
It feels so wrong, I'm barely holding on
See, no matter what it takes
I've gotta get it together
And these hills that I'm traveling up
She ain't showing me love
I'm down on my love
Oh, I'm down, whoa

[Chorus]
I know sorries just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated
I'm trying to travel through
But it's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
And the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
It's like moving a mountain
Steady trying to move this mountain
So, baby, why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?

[Outro]
Baby, baby
Whoa, yeah

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
All along it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something"
He said, "If you dare, come a little closer"

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

[Verse 2: Mikky Ekko]
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given

[Pre-Chorus: Mikky Ekko]
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

[Chorus: Mikky Ekko]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
And I want you to stay

[Bridge: Rihanna & Mikky Ekko]
Ooh, the reason I hold on
Ooh, 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

[Chorus: Rihanna & Mikky Ekko]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

[Outro: Rihanna & Mikky Ekko]
Stay
I want you to stay
Ooh

[Intro: Rihanna & Ne-Yo]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
That's how much I love you (Yeah)
That's how much I need you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Rihanna & Ne-Yo, Both]
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No)
But you won't let me
You upset me, girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (That I was upset)
Can't remember what you did
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
But I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you

[Chorus: Rihanna & (Ne-Yo)]
And I hate how much I love you, boy (Yeah)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy (Oh, whoa)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so (Oh)

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo & Rihanna]
You completely know the power that you have (Power that you have)
The only one makes me laugh (Makes me laugh)
Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I... (I)
Love you beyond the reason why (Why)
And it just ain't right, oh

[Chorus: Ne-Yo & (Rihanna)]
And I hate how much I love you, girl (Ooh)
I can't stand how much I need you (Yeah)
And I hate how much I love you, girl
But I just can't let you go (Ooh)
But I hate that I love you so

[Bridge: Rihanna & Ne-Yo, Both]
One of these days, maybe your magic won't affect me (Hmm)
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
Yeah
Ooh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Rihanna & Ne-Yo, Both]
That's how much I love you
How much as I need you
How much I need you
How much I love you

Stop, where am I? Shock, I can't cry
Pop, I need some space
No, this isn't me, go, please let me breathe
I'll be back sooner than you know

Revolving doors, what have I done?
Someone on the TV, a tepid loss
Revolving doors, what will I become?
A redneck song

[Chorus 1]
Paid up for seven
But he only got an eight now, now
I feel that I'm paused by all the pills
I see no wrong in here

[Verse 2]
On a foggy day
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
I sit in a diner and the Beatles play
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)

[Chorus 2]
I'm paid up for a seven
But I only got S.O. eight, oh, now
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
I feel that I'm paused by all the pills
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
I seem to run out here
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)

[Bridge]
Revolving doors
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
It's stormy on the Eastern Seaboard
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
He got silver up his nose
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)

[Chorus 3]
He paid up for three
But got only two

[Outro]
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
Then he said
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
Seems I was born for this
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)

My fellow Americans!
This is President Barack Obama, I just came off winning an election!
Dropped in on B.o.B's mixtape just to send a quick message
Me and B.o.B live by the same creed
F Em, We Ball
Our drive is in beast mode, you try to start yours and you stall
At the end of the day we do what we want to do and that's all
President Barack Obama and B.o.B approve this message
Because F Em, We Ball

[Verse 1]
It was a drive-by Sunday night
Most of us were in bed all right
I turned down the light
Then I heard the sirens
Interrupt the silence

[Chorus 1]
Is this what you wished
To commit a crime?
Is this what you wished
To commit a crime?
Is this what you wished
To commit a crime, commit a crime, commit a crime?

[Verse 2]
You was a nice guy, really bright
Making money's hard to do right
Guilty was his plight
Now he's in a jail cell
For some thirty years now

[Chorus 2]
Is this what you wished
To be serving time?
Is this what you wished
To be serving time?
Is this what you wished
To be serving time, serving time, serving time?

[Verse 3]
K's a friend of mine
I think about him as he does time
Miss his white wine
Funny I don't feel free
Even though it's not me

[Chorus 3]
Is this what you wished
To leave me behind?
Is this what you wished
To leave me behind?
Is this what you wished
To leave me behind, me behind, me behind?

[Verse 4]
Last year they decided
That his time is up and then he got retried
Double homicide
Sent him on to death row
Not to hang around though

[Chorus 4]
Is this what you wished
Did you want to die?
Is this what you wished
Did you want to die?
Is this what you wished
Did you want to die, want to die, want to die?
Did you want to die, want to die, want to die, want to die?
Did you want to die?

[Verse 1]
Another day is over
Another day is done
Now I'm getting closer
To the rising sun

[Chorus]
Hey, there, what you doing?
Would you like a little company?
Hey, man, how you doing?
Would you like to sit next to me?

[Verse 2]
Another day is over
Another day is done
Another night I'm waiting
Waiting for the sun

[Chorus]
Hey, there, what you doing?
Would you like a little company?
Hey, man, how you doing?
Would you like to sit next to me?

[Bridge]
Well, I don't know, little lady
You're awfully pretty
But I'm a nice man, I live a nice life
I have a nice house, I have a great wife
And I'm tired of making
Decisions without thinking
Another moon is shining
Another evening come
Another hour unwinding
Till the night is done

[Chorus]
Hey, man, what you doing?
Would you like a little company?
Hey, there, how are you doing?
Would you like to sit next to me, next to me, next to me?

[Intro]
This is a public service announcement
Brought to you by the good people over at Dreamville Records
"And so my fellow Americans
Ask not what your country can do for you
Ask what you can do for your country!"
Excuse me

[Verse 1]
Load the clip in the chopper, flip the script and get Oscars
All my niggas is mobsters, all my bitches is doctors
Cole World, this just the tip of the iceberg
So talk shit and taste the tip of the Mossberg
Don't trip nigga, they just words
Though my words tend to sound like Proverbs
Niggas don't see the preachers 'til we dead in the hearse
Granny broke cause she always givin' bread to the Church
Now pastor Mason Betha in a Lambo
And little niggas holdin' desert eagles like they Rambo
Bumpin' my shit, always wondered why they fuck with my shit
I hope it's 'bout the knowledge, not about who's suckin' my dick
But oh well, I'm gon' sell like I had no bail
For my chain and my piece I should've won Nobel
Ill, boy you cold nigga, yeah I know nigga
Only young nigga do it better than the old niggas

[Chorus]
Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch
Overcomin' the circumstances, we hella rich
Since you all in my business, this what I tell a bitch
If you ain't fuckin' me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit
Scoopin' hoes in the party, some Cinderella shit
Smash for the hell of it, livin' life on the edge

[Post-Chorus]
Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Just to floss pay any and every cost
Heavy heart as I sit in this Range countin' thousands out
Am I about dollars or about change?
Am I about knowledge or about brains?
Freedom or big chains, they don't feel my pain

[Verse 2]
Blood on my sneakers, no remorse for the grievers
He played the corner like Revis he should've had better defense
That's how I'm feelin', blood spillin' I love killin'
Niggas'll swear that they it, this is as rare as it gets
Rap game changed, this is embarrassing shit
Bunch of bitches posin' on some old Miss America shit
I was a wilder nigga back on my therapist shit, moving careless as shit
In a city where niggas really don't care who they hit
Who the fuck was I?
Just a young little nigga tryin' to see the other side
Of the railroad tracks, where them scarecrows at
No brains on a nigga but they'll air your back
Fuck the man, Uncle Sam I won't sell your crack
I won't fight your wars, I won't wear your hat
I'ma pass your classes, I'ma learn your craft
I'ma fuck your daughters, I'ma burn your flag

[Chorus]
Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch
Overcomin' the circumstances, we hella rich
Since you all in my business, this what I tell a bitch
If you ain't fuckin' me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit
Scoopin' hoes in the party, some Cinderella shit
Smash for the hell of it, livin' life on the edge

[Post-Chorus]
Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Just to floss pay any and every cost
Heavy heart as I sit in this Range countin' thousands out
Am I about dollars or about change?
Am I about knowledge or about brains?
Freedom or big chains, they don't feel my pain

[Outro]
They don't feel my pain
They'll never feel my pain
And they'll never play this shit on the radio

[Chorus]
Well you know it and I know it
I'm gonna be a star
You won't, you won't get me very far

[Verse 1]
Don't say hello
It's already time to go
Oh, the wind is carrying me home
Me home, me home again

[Chorus]
Well you know it and I know it
I'm gonna be a star
You won't, you won't get me very far

[Verse 2]
You saw life back in the countryside
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Oh, my soul rise up and go beyond, beyond
To what you know

[Intro]
She my distant lover, so far away
Dream of her, since that day
Distant lover, so far away
I wish that I could bring her here to me
Distant lover, so far away
Girl you so far away, hey
My distant lover, distant lover, hey
My distant lover, distant lover, hey
Girl, you so far away
You so far away, you so far away
My distant lover, distant lover
I wish that I could bring her here to me

[Verse 1]
Does she know, what she did
Turned my heart into flames
From that one time that she looked my way
Does she know, that sexy walk
Is still on my brain, when I think that I can't, I can't, I can't

[Chorus]
I can't take no more, I wanna be loving you
I've been in love with you
Since the day you came and you turned away
You never leave my brain
No, ooh
I can't take no more
I wanna be loving you, been in love with you
Since the day you came and you turned away
You'll never leave my brain
No, oh

[Post-Chorus]
This night I can't get you off my brain
And I don't want to
(No, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)

[Verse 2]
Does she know, what she did
I walk around smelling her scent, wanting her lips
And every time I lay down, go to sleep
It is you that I see
Wish you'd come to me
'Cause you still on my brain
No, I just can't, I just can't

[Chorus]
I can't take no more, I wanna be loving you
I've been in love with you
Since the day you came and you turned away
You never leave my brain
No, ooh (Oh, ooh)
I can't take no more
I wanna be loving you, been in love with you
Since the day you came and you turned away
You'll never leave my brain

[Interlude]
Never leave, no
My distant lover, you're my distant lover
(Babe, you so far away, you so far away)
I wish that I could bring you here to me

[Chorus]
I can't take no more, I wanna be loving you
(I wish that I could bring you here to me)
(Distant lover, distant lover)
You never leave my brain
I can't take no more
I wanna be loving you, been in love with you
My distant lover
I wish that I could bring you here to me

Everytime I hear the crack of a whip

Today they say that we are free
Only to be chained in poverty

It's only a machine that make money

[Chorus]

She said I’m ten times richer than her last man
I get like 50 thousand dollars on the back in
But fuck that, shop with me you know I got them bags in

[Verse 2]
I’m throwing money, nigga, like I’m Tom Brady
Don’t be surprised if Gucci fuck your old lady

Bitches standing in line, swear they’re waiting on me
So much ice on, I should have bought a winter coat
Put them chickens on the table like it's dinner time
You know Gucci Mane, the shit, that nigga been a fool
Ten naked stripper bitches in my swimming pool
Two topless Russian twins playing ping-pong
And they say my patience’s short, but my money long

[Hook]
Hopefully, hopefully
I’m running for mayor, come and vote for me
Vote for me, smoke with me
Front a couple bags, I’ll let you work for me
Sell dope for me, then blow for me

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Walk up from my spot, sit down, have a seat

Get your bitch ass down nigga, motherfucking move nigga

[Verse 3: Young Scooter & Gucci Mane]
What the fuck going on nigga?

[Verse 4: Gucci Mane]

Straight up out dat water wit my mark jacob goggles
And I go hard like a brett favre spiral

(Julez Santana)
Money in the bank

Living like a gangsta get it like a hustla
Ya girl friend backed up stick her wit da plumber
Baseball batter louisville slugger

(Lil Wayne)

And in the neighborhood my face is like a voucher
I swear I keep that gun on guard like a bouncer
A ounce of that kush I smoke that kush
And I run this muthafucker like reggie bush
New orleans crook
Give me wat I took
Me and my money
Thats a good book

[Chorus: Ciara]
I’m the shit with no makeup, don’t have to curl my hair up
All this booty here mine, I’m a dollar worth a dime
Real bosses stand up, ladies throw your hands up and say
“I know I’m cute, I know I’m fly
You ask me why? 'Cause I’m the shit!”
I’m the shit with no makeup, don’t have to curl my hair up
All this booty here mine, I’m a dollar worth a dime
Real bosses stand up, ladies throw your hands up and say
“I know I’m cute, I know I’m fly
You ask me why? 'Cause I’m the shit!”

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Beat em' like they stole some, beat em' like they stole some
All this booty here got 'em dreaming, lemme hold some
Let me, let me hear that boy, let me, let me wear that boy
Let me get the most expensive car, and let me steer that boy
Real big pretty titty, shut down every city
If you want the kid kitty, gotta get the key from me
All new everything, plus pay the rent for me
If we in the wilderness, niggas pitch the tent for me
Tent for me, tent for me, get me bodied
Long hair, no makeup, doing pilates
Those niggas don't step on my damn Zanottis
All them bitches my sons but who's the Daddy?
I graduate with honors, I ball, 'Nead O'Connor
I did a freestyle, then I got a shout out from Obama
Yes, yes, I am ill, I go in for the kill
Hoes is my sons, birth control, I am on the pill
What I gotta do? What I gotta do to 'em?
Step up in the club, everybody like who them?
Girls girls, me and my girls
What you done did? I need some referrals
Motherfuckers know I’m the shit, legit
And if a motherfucker don’t, he can suck my dick
I tell 'em, "Everybody else is my opposite!"
I put 'em on the game, give 'em five percent

[Chorus: Ciara]
I’m the shit with no makeup, don’t have to curl my hair up
All this booty here mine, I’m a dollar worth a dime
Real bosses stand up, ladies throw your hands up and say
“I know I’m cute, I know I’m fly
You ask me why? 'Cause I’m the shit!”
I’m the shit with no makeup, don’t have to curl my hair up
All this booty here mine, I’m a dollar worth a dime
Real bosses stand up, ladies throw your hands up and say
“I know I’m cute, I know I’m fly
You ask me why? 'Cause I’m the shit!”

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I’m like really famous, I got a famous anus
No, not Famous Amos, all this fame is heinous
Lemme, lemme hear that boy, lemme, lemme wear that boy
All this money coming in, but I never share that, boy
No lipstick, no lashes though
But I got a real big ol' ratchet, though
I said dude, yo dude, you packing dough
He said he want a good box like Pacquiao
I said, "Well, my name Nicki and it’s nice to meet you"
If you really wanna know, I’ll give you my procedure
Got a whole bunch of pretty gang in my clique
And we lookin' for some ballers, alopecia
I hate wack niggas, I should really slap niggas
These niggas trippin' when I put 'em on the map niggas
How you gon' break that? How you gon' fake that?
Ain't at no wedding but all my girls cake pop
Sleeping on me, no mattress though
I'm a burn the beat down, no matches though
No, they can’t keep up? They molasses slow
I'm the greatest Queens bitch, with the cashes flow
Looking, looking at me like it’s my fault
Trying to take sneak pictures with they iPhone
I like independent bitches like July 4th
Now that’s what young Harriet died for

[Chorus: Ciara]
I’m the shit with no makeup, don’t have to curl my hair up
All this booty here mine, I’m a dollar worth a dime
Real bosses stand up, ladies throw your hands up and say
“I know I’m cute, I know I’m fly
You ask me why? 'Cause I’m the shit!”
I’m the shit with no makeup, don’t have to curl my hair up
All this booty here mine, I’m a dollar worth a dime
Real bosses stand up, ladies throw your hands up and say
“I know I’m cute, I know I’m fly
You ask me why? 'Cause I’m the shit!”
This is the real Curtis Snow, y'know what I mean, from the real Bluff, y'know what I mean?
If you haven't heard of me, you might not have seen Snow On Tha Bluff, the movie, if you ain't, you need to go fuck with it
It's on iTunes, it's on Netflix, it's at Walmart, it's bootleg, it's all over the world, y'know what I mean?
It's some real shit man, that need to be seen, y'know what I'm talking about?
They try to hide this shit, but we gon' show 'em, this how this shit really go in the street
You can talk about it, but we live about it, for real, for real
Fuck with my nigga B.o.B man, 100% man
Came to the hood, y'know what I mean, shot the video, for real, for real, this how we do it man

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Man I go so dumb I should get a check for disability
Im a fucking lunatic you a liability
Don't know who you dealing with
Balling like I'm dribbling
Diabolic dialog
Flossing like some gentlemen
Gentleman and a scholar
Let me just pop my collar
I could make them throw they hands up
Throw they hands up like clock work
You should come to my concert
You should come see my tour
Man I go so berserk
Baby and the crowd go so bizarre
You're a bore you're a dork
Oh my lord I'mma snore
How depressing are my doors
How reflective are my floors
How impressive is my record
How seductive is that whore
I know exactly what she's after
No matter what happens she still want more
I am the captain she's on board
I'm finna tap them vocal chords
Take the rest of class she gon take that course
If she act wrong she gon walk that board
Hit her with the broom like a household chore
End of the show there's no encore
Lawyers on call all day 24
You ain't got to ask no "what's that for"
So tell me what the fuck you waiting for
I'm faded off of all these shots I pour
Of course she Juicy like Couture
Got booty galore, galore
Good lord

[Hook: B.o.B]
I tell em take they foot off the brake
There's no time to waste, no time to waste
Right now
And tell em pick up the pace
It's all kinds of pay, all kinds of pay
Right now
Fuck em, fuck em we ball
I said fuck em we ball
Fuck em we ball
Fuck em, fuck em we ball
Fuck

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Fuck em we ball
We don't owe em nothing we ain't cuffing these hoes
Ha, you getting mad cause she chose
Sonin' niggas up call it custody law
We ain't fucking with y'all
Let me dust my feet off
I'mma need a maid and butler just to buffer these hoes
Look you ain't even fucking with my cutlery cloth
Show me anybody hotter I'mma cut the heat off
Freeze your fleece off
So cold I could sneeze a G off
We don't see y'all
Nigga sleeping it's a dream off
Cut the sea salt if she's scheming poof be gone
I bet I hit a switch like roof be gone
Uh I a major leaguer (leegor)
That's why she's eager (egor)
To get that thing reupholstered you could check the decor
Ha, hop up in the seat what I need a key for
I just looked at the dealer fuck I need a lease for

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Spodee]
Fuck em we ball
Hem niggas talkin' tough but they just bluffing it y'all
Had discussion with dog bout niggas than we can tackle
We done laid more niggas down than a thirsty chiropractor
Smoking reefer to capture
The moments that leave us baffled
Even though I'm a sinner
I'm hoping I see the rapture
I believe in the chapters that come up after Matthew
This money is my liberty don't need no fucking statue
I'm a fucking nut like pistachios and cashews
Closet fever gucci louie fendi and what have you
Bad bitches with me want to get her and play taboo
A thousand for the noodles, five hundred for the ragu
I be on a magic carpet floating minus Abu
Y'all be in a kayak in the ocean with no paddles
I can pull a toaster and make ho niggas skedaddle
(?) with more guns on me than (?)

[Hook]

-NTG

[Chorus]
The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A murderous desire
For love

[Verse 1]
How can they look into my eyes
And still they don't believe me?
How can they hear me say those words
Still they don't believe me?
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever believe me?
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever, they ever believe me?
Oh, ohh... ohhh... ohhhh

[Chorus]
The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A plundering desire
For l-l-love

[Verse 2]
How can they see the love in our eyes
And still they don't believe us?
And after all this time
They don't want to believe us
And if they don't believe us now
Will they ever believe us?
And when you want to live, how do you start?
Where do you go? Who do you need to know?
Oh, ohh... ohhh... ohohohohoh

[Outro]
Oh...
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh...
Oh...
La lalala la da da...

[Intro]

I got the feeling now so I guess Ill just
Roll one up

[Verse 1]
It feels like a super rush
Adrenaline shots through the blood
When the time is right, I dooze it up
But any time my phone ring
Im not surprised cuz it usually does
First class, jewelry plush
I touch down to defuse it up
Then I hit the stage, head to the bus
Im not alone theres a crew of us
We party hard, we take shots
I had a few but I threw them up
Vegas nights, jacuzzi tub
Someone fire that hookah up

[Hook]
Looking at the ceiling fan spinning round
Yeah all I really wanna do is sit around
Thoughts in my head got me tripping out
I got the feeling now so I guess Ill just

[Verse 2]
We're born into the world
Living our lives out
Making enough bread to barely support our lifestyle
Thats crazy ain't it
Uncle Sam sure is shady ain't he
They say it ain't all black and white
But they ain't one shade of gray to paint it
Its complicated
But hey I can't complain, cuz it could always be worse
And I must have some nerve
Then again, I swear I'm never nervous
And you know we all make mistakes
I just make mine look good on purpose
Meanwhile Im getting blazed
Laughing at anti-drug commercials
Thats the sound, no bullshit allowed
Hovering above the world
I pray my feet never touch the ground
I'm in my element, fading in and out
And please believe if I ever show any signs of coming down
Then I'm gonna

[Hook]
Roll one up
Roll one up
Roll one up
So I guess Ill just
Roll one up

So I guess Ill just

[Bridge]
And it feels like somethings taking over
But it feels right now Im finally getting closer

What you make in ten years what I pay in taxes
Middle finger up way high to the masses
Stay out my business don't touch my jacket
You know what I'm bout you don't even got to to ask it
Fuck her for a long time give her that giraffe dick (aaahhh)
And if you feeling ratchet bitch I'm Juicy J

And somebody get my lawyer on the phone tell him add another couple mil to the contract
East side of Atlanta on my back
Where they ride with the hammers and the straps
It don't matter what it is you can name anything you can put my fam over that
Cause I ride for my fans
Every flight every time that I land
You can tell I'mma make big moves
Bout' the size of my plans
Rolex on my wrist but it ain't much time on my hands
That lambo shut em up call it silence of the lambs

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B.o.B]

Come and charge him with the 1-4-3, yeah
Told me this world was mine
Such a beautiful lie
Now it's done, done, done
And his love is no more for me
Hand in the air as he waved me goodbye
He say he care, but no tears in his eyes
And ask me if I'm alright
Nigga, is you blind?

[Chorus]
Like a bullet, your love hit me to the core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?
I call it murder, no love allowed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Fi-Fo-Fum, like the sky is falling down on me
Numb-numb-numb
He so cold, he doesn't feel a thing
Broken heart was the case
Go on and put him away
He's the only one-one-one I ever let get the best of me
Hand in the air as he waved me goodbye
He say he care, but no tears in his eyes
And ask me if I'm alright
Nigga, is you blind?

[Chorus]
Like a bullet, your love hit me to the core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?
I call it murder, no love allowed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Usually I'm the one that they cry for
But this man, he's the one that I'd die for
Mama said there's no 'cause for a rebel
Do you hear me now?
No love, no love, no love allowed

[Chorus]
Like a bullet, your love hit me to the core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?
I call it murder, no love allowed
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?
I call it murder, no love allowed

[Hook]
I don’t wanna waste your time
I just wanna change your life
And if anything goes down, anything goes wrong
I’mma make things right

Baby, won’t you be there?
I’ll be there, tell me won’t you be there?
Baby, won’t you be there?

[Verse 1]
Shittin’ on these niggas
Balling on these hoes
Two bad bitches
They're in my bathrobes
Everything's gold, everything's cold
Yeah everything froze
Money entertain hoes
Anything goes, you already know

[Bridge 1]
And you know they're some gold diggers
But you know we're some cold niggas
Might blow like so nitro
We ain't going back and forth with ya

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Sittin’ on these figures
Hopping out of doors
Full cup of liquor
Fired up that dro
I do it like so
I be whippin’ so hard, got a call Geico
I’m already in my zone
And I’m already gone
I’m already blown

[Bridge 1]

[Hook]

[Bridge 2]

[Hook]

[Intro]
So we take another shot
To take the edge off life
And then we roll another one
Make it feel alright

[Verse 1]
Prepared for the worst, expecting the best
I said I’m light years, ahead of the rest
I need a s, s on my chest
These niggas lame, they need the L on they neck
Looser, you are such a loser
Pull up in that rooster, you in that pt cruiser
Watch your girl get loose, your girl such a chooser
She be with the crew before you even introduce her
Yeah, I’m on that next level
You, you have no clue sir
This is what I do, I’m faded and I’m too turnt
My life like a highlight
Your life like a blooper
Every verse agitates my tooth, cause the truth hurt

[Hook]
So we take another shot
To take the edge off life
And then we roll another one
Make it feel alright
Lost in the moment, lost in the party one more time
So we roll another one
Make it feel alright

[Verse 2]
Yea, who that who that?
Me, I do that do that
Let them doors up, call that Russian roulette
Don’t touch nothing in my whip
Who said you can move that?
Any city on the map wherever I put my boot at
My roof back, my coupe black, my soup lack
My lute back, I re-up that new pack
My new hat, I threw that
My concerts be too packed
I crowd surf and don’t snatch my shoe back
True immaculates (alright), too extravagant (alright)
Shitting on your whole life, sue me after this
I said true immaculates (alright), too extravagant (alright)
I never miss a country cause I’m usually back again

[Hook]

[Skit: Iggy Azalea]
"This bitch, came to the club, with an overnight bag. She was so ready. She came, to the club, with an overnight bag, with a separate set of clothes in it. Took her shoes off. This bitch was back in the car with me and fuckin' B.o.B, tryna talk to B.o.B's friend, with her overnight bag. Had done fuckin' changed shoes. And I was like, 'wait a minute B.o.B, isn't that the same bitch from earlier tonight? But she in a whole different outfit?' And this bitch had a plastic bag READY. Ready for her fucking vacation. Just fuckin' crazy. YES! A 24-hour vacation. She was fuckin' ready. For the 24-hour trip of a motherfuckin' lifetime. And she knew what she was comin' for before the club opened. She packed! She probably had some wet wipes in there, like everything. THAT GIRL was crazy though, you know she was crazy. AND THEN was like, 'but I got a boyfriend' - BITCH, you don't have a boyfriend! Fuck outta here. That was the crazy shit. Remember that?"

[Verse 1: B.o.B]

[Hook: B.o.B]
I wanna get high, so blowed tonight
I wanna get high, so blowed tonight
So high

[Verse 2: B.o.B]

Sparkles on the bottles, girls going wild
A night like this won’t end so fast that good

[Hook: B.o.B]

[Verse 3: Snoop Lion]
Buckle your seatbelts, enjoy the ride
This is a mission for the missin', information’s advised
Ladies, come with me and then take it easy
Here’s a bleezy for you and your friend, I light it up
All I know is that we bout to get blowed
You’da sit knack back
Now baby girl let’s roll, I let my mind go with the whirl
But then blaze up the change up
The game up, raise up
Final leave minor league, now I’m living major

Smoke rains appear, the king is here
Power to the people

[Hook: B.o.B]

Girl I need to tell ya something
Something I’d like to do
I’m telling you that time is money
You know I’d spend it all on you
On you, on you
You know I’d spend it all on you
On you, on you
You know I’d spend it all on you

[Verse 1]
All on you, spending it all on you
Like it’s the end of the world, as if it were God coming
That tall money, taller than Paul Bunion
Fuck my dashboard’s leather, you still with that cloth homie
I don’t like shallow women cause I like to fall
Plummet and dive, get lost in it
Leave her with a tall tummy
Uh, on gin and tonic, we chillin', we all blunted
Now hop off my dick, fuck off and go blog something
Man I’m spendin' it, spendin' it
Stocks, pensions, and benefits
Never go broke, no not even close
Swagger on infinity
If you feelin' it, get with it bitch
I do anything so diligent
I’ll go dumb on that pussy, make that clitoris go illiterate
How inconsiderate

[Hook]
Girl I need to tell ya something (I need to tell ya something)
Something I’d like to do (I’d like to do with ya)
I’m telling you that time is money (getting money)
You know I’d spend it all on you
On you, on you
All on you, spendin' it all on you
20’s, 50’s and 100’s, I’m spendin' it all on you
Aye, It’s all on you, spendin' it on you
On you, on you
If time is money, I’m spendin' it all on you
You know I’d spend it all on you

[Verse 2]
Bobby Ray, get more stoned than the cemetery
Middle finger to the haters and my adversaries
To these basic niggas I am not to be compared with
Committed to the game, money is the sex in this here marriage
But not necessarily, I spend it for therapy
You ain’t ballin', you just affordin', you doin' it barely
And I don’t need no change to help me see this clearly
But girl you got me caught up all in you apparently
Spendin' it, thumb through the check, I’m littering
They hate to see us when we ballin'
So when we stunt, we do it deliberately
Now I’m feeling it, feeling it, holding that fire like a statue of liberty
We left the spot with so many bags they had to restock the facility
Man, that’s ridiculous

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Girl you got me like
You got me like caught up in all kind of ways
Make a nigga wanna just like
Make a nigga do something foolish like
Just go to the mall and just
Just go to the mall and just leave with them all
Whoop oh, we don’t need shopping bags
We just go into the mall and we gon leave with the mall
Huh, ain’t that a fool?

[Hook]
Girl I need to tell ya something (I need to tell ya something)
Something I’d like to do (I’d like to do with ya)
I’m telling you that time is money (big money)
You know I’d spend it all on you
On you, on you
All on you, spendin' it all on you
20’s, 50’s and 100’s, I’m spendin' it all on you
Aye, It’s all on you, spendin' it all on you
If time is money, I’m spendin' it all on you
(You know I’d spend it all on you)

[Spoken: Kevin Hart]
Ayy man, this your boy Kev Hart man. Uh, real quick, you got a mixtape coming out called Fuck Em We Ball, I'm just curious to know why you ain't put my nigga Droppa on there? Like as if you don't know what he is and what he's about. Man, it took a lot for me to get him not to call you right now. You know, he called me to facilitate the situation so I'm tryin' to but this is tough man. I mean you do, you do a mixtape without the realest dude in the game. Kinda makes me think like, like are you afraid of Droppa's success? Dude, we gotta talk man, like this is crazy and I just hope it ain't that man' cause I would hate for Drop to have to get serious and come looking for you. As somebody who knows him and knows what he's capable of I suggest you take this as a warning dude. You either put Droppa on your side or you go down... just like the rest of 'em. I'm just tryna be your friend man. Bye

[Hook]
Tonight, I don’t wanna have to decide
We all gon have a hell of a night, a night, a night, a night
Hell of a night, it’s a hell of a night oh yeah
Cause I don’t wanna be impolite
And we could have a hell of a night, a night, a night, a night
Hell of a night yeah, hell of a night yeah
It’s a hell of a night, it’s a hell of a night yeah

[Verse 1]
First I step, I step, I step I-I-I-I
First I step in, then I collect
Yeah, I’m in the building, don’t break your neck
You know I got my team with me, hustle gang we on
Like a stack of cards we on deck
So who got the check?
When it come to kush I got the best
If money talk's shit then I've got Tourette’s
Be in this swag is what I possess
I roll up and pop a band with no sweat
I don’t rest all night cause I’m a big league vet
Down to earth but I’m fresh to death
So that mean that my outfit 6 feet less
Nigga I ain’t even got no worries
Nigga I ain’t even got no stress
And my nigga fresh off probation
Can’t talk, I gotta catch this jet
Bad bitch, get your hair weave wet
There’s a night that you can’t forget
I’m the type that they can’t hold back
I’m so faded I can’t focus
So tonight I wanna say one thing
One thing you could probably guess
If you left this bitch with me
It will be a night that you won’t regret

[Hook]
So tonight, I don’t wanna have to decide
We all gon have a hell of a night, a night, a night, a night
Hell of a night, it’s a hell of a night oh yeah
Cause I don’t wanna be impolite
And we could have a hell of a night, a night, a night, a night
Hell of a night yeah, hell of a night yeah
It’s a hell of a night, it’s a hell of a night yeah

[Verse 2]
I can’t decide, tell me why I must pick a side
You and your friend should hop in the Benz
Put one in the back, put one in the side
Roll up the stuff, don’t hold us up
Don’t stop the flow, no don’t stop the vibe
Foot on the gas, hand on the wheel
Head in my lap, oh what a night
That loud pack so loud
Sound like Zeus fell from the sky
I walk in – they go nuts like 2Pac has just arrived
That-that wood’s what I provide
I’m gonna meet you and I’m fine
My city on in a major way shouts out to the east side
With my niggas straight throwing up sets
Drink a bottle, I ain’t throwed up yet
In the private lounge with a pound
We just upgrade, you just get upset
So tonight I wanna know one thing
One thing you could probably guess
If you left this bitch with me
It will be a night that you won’t regret

[Hook]
So tonight, I don’t wanna have to decide
We all gon have a hell of a night, a night, a night, a night
Hell of a night, it’s a hell of a night oh yea
Cuz I don’t wanna be impolite
And we could have a hell of a night, a night, a night, a night
Hell of a night yea, hell of a night yea
It’s a hell of a night, it’s a hell of a night yea

[Hook]
One hand on the clutch, life in the fast lane
Money ain’t nothing if it can’t come the fast way
Chronic, chronic, chronic, roaches in my ashtray
It’s that presidential shit, welcome to my campaign
To my campaign, to my campaign
Same lifestyle, ain’t a damn thing's changed
To my campaign, welcome to my campaign
Same old lifestyle, ain’t a thing's changed

[B.o.B.]
I say my mixtape's better than your album
How come? Really, you were better off without one
Sideline haters, they can’t tolerate the outcome
You're the runner-up type, me they cannot outrun
Sit your whack-ass down, calm the fuck down some
Take a fucking Valium, now DJ crank the volume
Tell her like
"Keep your head steady I’m about done"
Passed out, please don’t wake me up until the ounce comes
I’m in the hood like an Obama sticker
I’m from the hood, you're a neighborhood watch nigga
I'll fall through with a "made you look", watch nigga
Pissing niggas off like swastikas

[Hook]

[Playboy Tre]
I'm campaigning with my Ace, he just beat a case
So we've got liquor by the crates, yelling "fuck the state"
I guess that you can say it’s fate
That we made it from the bottom of the bottom
Where somebody's always shooting, but don’t nobody know we shot ‘em
I just pray the angels got him, I hope the Lord embrace him
I swear to y'all, the streets are Hell
That’s why I call my pistol Satan
If we don’t make it then it’s back to doing Devilish things
Now tell that freak to drop it lower than her self esteem
Death to my opponents, this is my crowning moment
The life we livin' can't be rented boy, you gotta own it
I’m feelin lethal, sipping Brandy, that Moesha
You saw that buzz uppercut, that's how the flow will treat ya

[Hook]

[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
(You good to go?)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift &  Ed Sheeran]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran & Taylor Swift]
And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Outro: Taylor Swift]
All I know is we said, "Hello"
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Part I: Love Without Tragedy

[Refrain]
Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low
Dean on the low

[Verse]
I ask you, "What's the matter?"
You say "Oh, it's nothing at all."
Heart's racing outta control
And you knew that I couldn't let it go
You used to be this boy I loved
And I used to be this girl of your dreams
Who knew the course of this one drive injured us fatally?
You took the best years of my life
I took the best years of your life
Felt like love struck me in the night
I prayed that love don't strike twice

[Refrain]
Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low

[Chorus]
What's love without tragedy?
What's love without tragedy?
(Marilyn Monroe)
What's love without tragedy?
What's love without tragedy?

Part II: Mother Mary

[Verse 1]
Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change
Mister Jesus, I'd love to be a queen
But I'm from the left side of an island
Never thought this many people would even know my name
As time flies way above me
For you, I've cried, tears ceding
Oh glory, the prayers carry me
I'll be a star, you keep directing me
Let's make the best scene they've ever seen

[Verse 2]
Let's capture the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promise forever
Let's live in the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promise forever
Let's live by the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
To die in the moment

[Verse 1]
Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change
Mister Jesus, I'd love to be a queen
But I'm from the left side of an island
Never thought this many people would even know my name
As time flies way above me
For you, I've cried, tears ceding
Oh glory, the prayers carry me
I'll be a star, you keep directing me
Let's make the best scene they've ever seen

[Verse 2]
Let's capture the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promise forever
Let's live in the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promise forever
Let's live by the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
To die in the moment

[Outro]
Die the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promise forever
I'm prepared to die in the moment

[Chorus: Parker Ighile]
What we do when we go high?
We doing it all night
Ooh the girls, they wanna vibe with us tonight
I'm in the middle of the club with my niggas and we all fucked up
Screaming hell yeah, hell yeah
What we do when we go high?
We doing it all night
Ooh the girls, they wanna vibe with us tonight
I'm in the middle of the club with my niggas and we all fucked up
Screaming hell yeah, hell yeah

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yeah, yeah
I ain't see you on the Forbes yet
Swear to God, I ain't see you in the stores yet
Donatella on the corset
Pretty Gang, in the back of my Corvette
Copped my best friends Rangers and Benzes
Plus all my menses, Louie V lenses
This is how it feel, when you winnin'
Man, they been rocking with me since the beginning, inning
This is where the stress ends
Feel ill, when you never gotta stress ends
Always in the press when
Paparazzi in the bushes, with the stretch lens
Say cheese to that, pull up on the double R, pop clutch on them
No, them strippers ain't mad, when I touch on them
Russell Simmons shoe game, put a rush on them
Send a GT vodka, sitting on top of
Mafia money, eating seafood pasta
VMA's, I was good there, front row, yeah, always in a good chair
The bad gon' boo, but the good cheer, that's why my pockets on blimp, like the Good Year
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Parker Ighile]
What we do when we go high?
We doing it all night
Ooh the girls, they wanna vibe with us tonight

What we do when we go high?
We doing it all night
Ooh the girls, they wanna vibe with us tonight
I'm in the middle of the club with my niggas and we all fucked up
Screaming hell yeah, hell yeah

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
But, you're boring as fuck though, why these bitches in the game so cutthroat?
Why they can't just let Young Nicki live? Why they gotta feel the wrath, to know Nicki is -
Not playing? Boss for real, when they go against The Kid, it's gon' cost for-real (Pharrell)
Came straight from the hood, with the cross appeal
That's why these big names, wanna toss the deal
Okay, I'll take it, sign on the dotted line, but I'm quick to check a bitch if she outta line
Shout out Mike Darnell and Nigel, why these bums so mad that the queen on Idol, huh?
Say cheese to that, when they see me on the screen, check E! for that
Bitches lying on the kid, I won't leave for that, intimidated by my aura, where Rita at?
Send a GT vodka, in a helicopter, me and my Japanese bitches
In Osaka
BET, I was good there, front row, yeah, always in a good chair
Why the fuck would I leave, when I'm good here?
Let me send a Twitpic of my good hair, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Parker Ighile]
What we do when we go high?
We doing it all night
Ooh the girls, they wanna vibe with us tonight
I'm in the middle of the club with my niggas and we all fucked up
Screaming hell yeah, hell yeah
What we do when we go high?
We doing it all night
Ooh the girls, they wanna vibe with us tonight
I'm in the middle of the club with my niggas and we all fucked up
Screaming hell yeah, hell yeah

[Chorus: Rene Rowe & Amoy Levy]
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Anyway, lil' nigga don't test the kid
Even Maury Povich couldn't test the kid
Even R. Kelly couldn't touch the kid
And even with all your bars, you couldn't text the kid
I got a pool that I never even swam in
Airports that you bitches never land in
They be like, "What you doin', Nicki?" Brandin'
Suck a cockpit, prepare for landing
I'm brandin', I ain't talking about Priestley
I keep a sniper, I ain't talking about Wesley
Why these bitches so pressed, B?
Open my trunk, all I gotta do is press B
I'mma violate y'all asses like Chris Stokes
I'm in Saint-Tropez, on a big boat
Go my way to make a billi like a big goat
Pull my dick out case you bitches get a slick throat

[Chorus: Rene Rowe & Amoy Levy]
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Want another round? Well, then get the ref!
Got the clothing line popping, and the wigs is next
When I fly, you know G5 is the jet
I'm the motherfuckin' Queen, 'lizabeth
Meetings with the president of every network
That is what the fuck I call how to network
My net worth, that net works
Keep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the Nets work
Chillin' with executives
Check the charts, all my winnings are consecutive
Trillion dollar deficit
But y'all don't hear me though, all you bitches deaf as shit
Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow
I have both and an empire also
Sell out shows out in Norway, Oslo
This is The Re-Up, better cop it while the cost low
Flow's sick, I'll slap a patient
I'm checking these bitches like an application
'Cause these bitches trippin', no navigation
So it's off with your head, decapitation
S-s-send 'em up in flames like a fireman
I do the hiring and I do the firing
That boss shit that you talk, I live it
And I'm calling a travel if you don't stay on your pivot
Bitches

[Chorus: Rene Rowe & Amoy Levy]
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher

[Outro: Rene Rowe & Amoy Levy]
Going up in flames
Going up in flames

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
We the cause of all the commotion
Your mouth running, but where is you going?
What is you smoking, man? That ain't potent
What is you talking, man? That ain't important
Illuminati, High society
We in this party and nobody invited me
We going crazy and I always use my best sense
But it don't matter cause I stay on my fresh prince
Maxin', relaxin, shootin' some pool and
Playing some b-ball outside of the school and
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and
Whips with the drop off outside of the Louvre
You just look stupid to be ignoring
The Delorean parked in front of Armani emporium
And parties at Richie is getting risky
Victoria's Secret show, they miss me
Voices in my head, I need choices in my bed
AHHHHH, get out my fucking head
It's just me and my bad bitch
So you can say I'm on my Brad Pitt
Back to the la familia I'm aligned with
Before I betray them I slit my wrists
At the top is just us nigga
Cause I don't really trust niggas
And we made it through the hurricane
So celebrate and light the Mary Jane
We gon' make it, that's on everything
Truest girls get half naked, every spring
They saying, "Hey Kanye
We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday,"
Cause my verses got pain, Chocolate Rain
So many lines, you photograph and it make arms break
On the radio, man I miss myself
I need to just step back and kiss myself
Baby, just step up and kiss the belt
A little lower.. that's what's up
Somebody pour her another cup
Is it too much to ask you keep your diamonds up?
I swear until my time is up
My style is sex in the shower, fresh as fuck

[Hook: Rihanna]
So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

[Post-Hook: Rihanna]
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

[Pre-Hook: Rihanna]
I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh right away
At first sight I felt energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

[Hook: Rihanna]
So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

[Post-Hook: Rihanna]
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

[Outro: Rihanna]
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now
Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Baby, tonight I need you
And I feel it when I see you
Wherever you wanna go
Whenever, baby, I'm yours

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now

So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now
Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now

So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now
'Cause all we got is right now

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
So close, I can taste you
Ain't scared, I can take you
Can't fight the feeling
Got me fiendin'
You got me fiendin'
Something you wanted to do all your life
There's no more waiting, tonight is the night
And it can't be wrong, not if it feels this right
Turn it up
Scream it loud, yeah

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now
Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now
'Cause all we got is right now

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
He said he came from Jamaica, he owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & (Lil Wayne)]
They holler at me, but it's you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Put it wherever you want
Baby, it's yours
Anywhere, everywhere
Baby, it's your world, ain't it? (Alright)
Baby, it's your world, ain't it? (Uh)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
She got a nigga at home, and one on the side
Best friend is a dyke, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight
I tell her make me some money, she tell me, "Make me a wife"
I tell her, "Bitch, you crazy, fuck wrong with you?"
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'
And I say, "What about them niggas?" She say, "What about them niggas?"
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight, don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'ma need goggles
She tell me that's it's mine, I tell her stop lyin'
Mine and who else? She say worry 'bout yourself
Lil Tune

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
They holler at me, but it's you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Put it wherever you want
Baby, it's yours
Anywhere, everywhere
Baby, it's your world, ain't it?
Baby, it's your world, ain't it?

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
I know you want it, boy
I see you tryin'
Just keep on pushin'
I'ma let you slide in
Just close your eyes and
This horizon
It's ready, come get you some
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Above all, fuck the law, bitch, I'm on now
Ride around puffin' loud with the top down
Start a goddamn riot in the compound
Turn the whole room into a dog pound
I ain't no motherfuckin' industry rapper
Just a soul that the industry after
They said I wouldn't make a lot of money no more
Fuck with my money and I'm comin' for war, be sure (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Some niggas fuck with me 'cause respect
Some fuck with me for the check
Loyalty before royalty, my nigga till' the death
Came down wit' em' came up wit' em'
Fuck niggas don't fuck wit' em'
If you in or you out ain't no on and off this bus nigga
Perfect beats, Bugatti I just bought a ten million dollar house
Did it independent now my label wanna help me out
Cause I got it worldwide boy I made it out the south
Guys shy built 250 they ain't want to help me out
Bank account got local bitches they ain't help me out
Grindin' out dropped a mixtape at the tape
Me and southside goin' hard fuck what they say
Fuck this industry I bet these DJs they gon' play SQUAD

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Above all, fuck the law, bitch, I'm on now
Ride around puffin' loud with the top down
Start a goddamn riot in the compound
Turn the whole room into a dog pound
I ain't no motherfuckin' industry rapper
Just a soul that the industry after
They said I wouldn't make a lot of money no more
Fuck with my money and I'm comin' for war, be sure

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
My rappin' cadence is fascinatin'
This game that I'm calibratin'
Have buildings evacuatin' whenever my name is said
I hate the Federlines, spendin' time gettin' high
Watched over by heaven's eyes, protect me from this genocide
Kill the king, many tried, success is yet to come
When you come across a killer under stress, it's best to run
My mind dots with no limits, shit, a gun is just a gun
When I'm spittin', bone chillin', this ain't shit, I'm havin' fun, uh
You ain't gonna rap like me, put a city on the map like me (No sir)
Sell a beat, bring it back like me, kill tracks when you're half asleep (No)
You ain't gonna chase your dreams (No)
You never gon' live your life (No)
Fuck a movie, gonna make a scene (Let's go)
Sit back, let me hit the lights
Simple knowledge, but it's true
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with you
What you doin' runnin' 

[?] from a view of love and truth
This a business, no one gives a shit about you (No)
They gon' fuck you up, go and get this bread without you

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Above all, fuck the law, bitch, I'm on now
Ride around puffin' loud with the top down
Start a goddamn riot in the compound
Turn the whole room into a dog pound
I ain't no motherfuckin' industry rapper
Just a soul that the industry after
They said I wouldn't make a lot of money no more
Fuck with my money and I'm comin' for war, be sure

[Verse 1]
I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? Oh-oh-oh-oh
What now?

[Verse 2]
I found the one
He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love, but I'm numb again

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just sitting there laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? (Please tell me)
What now?

[Bridge]
There's no one to call, 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
But the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? (Somebody tell me)
What now?

[Outro]
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
So what now?

[Nicki Minaj]
I got a fetish for boys, that's pushing them nice toys
A fetish for dem boys, that's fresher than altoids, I got a -
Thing for a dude, in a fresh pair of Mauri's
If he rocking 'em right, then I might let him call me
He put the Prada bag, with the Prada heels wid it
The Louis dufflebag, had about a mil' in it
From here to Trinidad, man I should've been did it
Cause everything I had, I just doubled them digits
That's the kinda dude, that can roll with the President
Sit up in the Rolls maybe, roll to my residence
Stay around Fendi,, he love my spaghetti
He let me do my thing, he ain't never act petty
If he ringing, I'm dipping, put the ring in my lip and
I just give 'em wink, what the fuck did you think?
Now he spending and tricking, so the chickens is tripping
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, ha ha hahahaha HA!

[Hook]
That's what my girls say
Errday my birthday
Young Money sipping rozay when we thirstay
Okay, c'mon

[Lil Wayne]
Good Evening New York! (Water crashing against shore sound)
That mean I live by the beach
Sand on the welcome mat, flyer than a Falcon
Black tires, black rims, just to help em look good
In the summer, my car look better than your woman
My woman look better than your momma
And I don't wanna name, or number, just some brain from her, naw
I ain't came in a Hummer, that's a Bentley Marlow on her
I'm nasty on the beat like the runners, I'm a gunner
Like a hunter with a gun, with a deer right in front 'em
I'mma send him to who brung him, let Nina Ross Tongue him
Oh back to the subject, I'm balling without a budget
I'm a big spender, but I ain't done yet
Ima keep that shit running, like I’m Marshall Faulk’s son and
On a Sunday,I’m Devin Hester, you don’t want to punt it
You do it but I done it, I stun it, I spun it

[Hook]
That's what my girls say
Errday my birthday
Young Money sipping rosay when we thirstay

[Verse 1]
What am I supposed to do with this heart?
How do I take it off if I love at all?
It's like a work of art
In love, we all will fall, but
We fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?
It may be wrong, but it feels right
To be lost in paradise

[Chorus]
I'm so lost in paradise
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears, gone tonight
Let me stay
I'm lost in paradise
(Bass slap)

[Verse 2]
How was I to know that my love was delusional?
Somebody told me how to mend
A broken hearted soul
In love, we all will fall, but
We fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?
It may be wrong, but it feels right
To be lost in paradise

[Chorus]
I'm so lost in paradise (Lost in paradise)
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears, gone tonight
Let me stay
I'm lost in paradise
(Bass slap, bass slap)

[Bridge]
It may be wrong, but it feels right
All my fears are gone tonight
I'm lost in paradise

[Chorus]
I'm so lost in paradise (Lost in paradise)
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears, gone tonight
Let me stay
I'm lost in paradise
Lost in paradise
Yeah
Lost in paradise
Lost in paradise
(Bass slap)

[Verse 1]
You saw me on a television
Setting fire to all the buildings
Yeah, I guess you saw me stealing
But you've no idea what I've been needing
We talk about when we were children
Not the kind of kid you believe in
You saw me on a television
Saw me on a television

[Chorus]
But that's just the half of it
Yeah, you saw the half of it
This is the life I live
And that's just the half of it

[Verse 2]
You saw me on a television
Hanging out my dirty linen
You're entitled to your own opinion
Sit and shake your head at my decisions
I guess the kind of songs that I've been singing
Make it seem as if I'm always winning
But you saw me on a television
Yeah, you saw me on a television

[Chorus]
But that's just the half of it
You saw the half of it
This is the life I live
And that's just the half of it

[Bridge]
Oh, you know me
I'm the life of the party
Beautiful people surround me
Everybody fallin' in love
Oh, you know me
Everybody knows that I'm crazy
Sticks and stones, they never break me
And I'm the type that don't give a fuck

[Chorus]
And that's just the half of it
You saw the half of it
Yeah, this is the life I live
And that's just the half of it
Yeah, you saw the half of it
And this is the life I live
You saw the half of it
Only the... half of it
Yeah, whoa

[Outro]
Saw me on a television
Saw me on a television

[Verse 1]
Flying high in the friendly sky
Flying high without ever leaving the ground, no
Rest of the folks are tired and weary
Oh Lord, and have laid their bodies down
I go to the place where danger awaits me
And it's bound to forsake me
So stupid minded
I can't help it, so stupid minded
But I go crazy when I can't find it
In the morning, I'll be alright, my friend
But soon the night will bring the pains
The pain, awful pain

[Verse 2]
Flying high in the friendly sky
Without ever leaving the ground
And I ain't seen nothing but trouble baby
Nobody really understands, no, no
And I go to the place where the good feeling awaits me
Self destruction's in my hand
Oh Lord, so stupid minded
Oh and, I go crazy when I can't find it
Well I know I'm hooked my friends
To the boy who makes slaves out of men
And oh, believe me

[Outro]
Flying high in a friendly sky
Flying high in a friendly sky

[Verse 1]
Did I hear you say you love me?
Well baby, I've got to know
‘Cause if you really really love me
You've got to do things to show
Don't give me the wrong impression
By showing me warm expression
Put me in the right direction
With tender love and affection
I've been standing on the outside
Trying to get on the inside

[Verse 2]
Did I hear you say you need me?
Well baby, tell me the truth
‘Cause if you really really need me
My sweetness, here's what I'll do
Cut out all my crazy playing
‘Cause for your love I have been laying
Just tell me that is what you're saying
And I'll be yours without delaying
I've been standing on the outside
Trying to get on the inside

[Chorus]
Well, if you love me, honey, let me hear you say (I love you)
If you love me, honey, let me hear you say (I love you)
Sounds so good
Well, if you love me, honey, let me hear you say (I love you)

[Verse 3]
Did I hear you say you want me?
Now please don't give me no mess
‘Cause if you really really want me
You've got to give me your best
Put my love life right in the pocket
And dare someone to try to top it
And when you think I want to drop it
Just love me ‘til I beg, don't stop it
‘Cause I've been standing on the outside
Trying to get on the inside

[Chorus]
Well, if you love me, honey, let me hear you say (I love you)
If you love me, honey, let me hear you say (I love you)
Well, if you love me, honey, let me hear you say (I love you)
If you love me, let me hear you say (I love you)

[Outro]
If you love me, let me hear you say (I love you)
And if you need me, let me hear you say (I love you)
And if you want me, let me hear you say (I love you)
If you need me, let me hear you say (I love you)
If you want me, let me hear you say (I love you)
If you need me, let me hear you say (I love you)
If you want me, let me hear you say (I love you)
And if you need me, let me hear you say (I love you)

[Bridge]
Do Do Do, Do Do Do, Do Do Do, Do Do Do
Do Do Do, Do Do Do, Do Do Do

[Verse 1]
I longed for you since I was born
A woman sensitive and warm
And that you were
With pride and strength no one would test
But yet have feminine finesse
And so much more

[Chorus]
You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
Took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world

[Verse 2]
A female Shakespeare of your time
With looks to blow Picasso's mind
You were the best
Your body moved with grace and song
Like symphonies by Bach or Brahms
Nevertheless, oh oh

[Chorus]
You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
Took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world

[Bridge]
Do Do Do, Do Do Do, Do Do Do, Do Do Do
Do Do Do, Do Do Do, Do Do Do

[Verse 3]
The passion burning in your heart
Would make hell's fire seem like a spark
Where did it go
Just why that you would overnight
Turn love to stone as cold as ice
I'll never know

[Chorus]
But you took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
Baby, you took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world (Cold, too cold)

[Chorus]
You took me riding in a rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped my Black ass
Down to this cold, cold world
...me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down into this cold, cold world
(I would not do that to a dog, baby)

[Chorus]
You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world

(Rocket love)
Come on out, come on out
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?
I don't mean to play here

Figure out, figure out
What you know? What you know?
Figure out how to say it clear
'Cause you’re more likely to get cut with a dull tool
Than a sharp one

You, you stuck around
You stuck around
You stuck around
Until you got me
Then, then you dropped me

[Hook]
You don't kiss when you kiss
You don't fuck when you fuck
You don't say what you mean
You don't talk loud enough
No pulse in your impulse
Celebration's impossible
You forgot the difference between equanimity and passivity
You forgot you have to try, you have to try, you have to try
You forgot that glorious feeling that you get when you get the truth
So tell that girl you don't love her
And if you do, tell her two times
'Cause you're more likely to get cut with a dull tool
Than a sharp one

You don't kiss when you kiss
You don't fuck when you fuck
You don't say what you mean
You don't talk, not enough
No pulse in your impulse
Celebration's impossible when

You don’t kiss when you kiss
You don’t fuck when you fuck
You don’t say what you mean
You don't talk, not enough
No pulse in your impulse
Celebration's impossible

You don't kiss when you kiss
You don't fuck when you fuck
You don't say what you mean
You don't talk, not enough
No pulse in your impulse
Celebration's impossible when
You don’t kiss when you kiss
You don’t fuck when you fuck
You don’t say what you mean
You don't talk, not enough
No pulse in your impulse
Celebration's impossible

Celebration's impossible
Celebration's impossible
Celebration's impossible

[Verse 1]
Don't wanna believe what they're telling me
Somebody's been picking in my cherry tree
Don't wanna mistrust nobody by mistake
But I can tell someone's been digging round in my cake

[Hook]
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
I ain't gonna stand for it baby

[Verse 2]
Don't wanna believe what somebody said
But somebody said somebody's shoes was under my bed
Don't wanna cause nobody no bodily harm
But somebody's been rubbing on my good luck charm

[Hook]
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
I ain't gonna stand for it baby

[Bridge w/ Ad-libing]

[Hook]
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
I ain't gonna stand for it baby

[Verse 1]
Close your eyes ‘til the morning
Close your eyes ‘til the early dew
Get inside what you've been missing
Are the very first words that I heard coming from you

[Verse 2]
Take a chance on the secret
That you hide far beneath your dreams
Use your wildest imagination
You just tell me what it is and I will make it be

[Chorus]
As if you read my mind
As if you touched my soul
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go

[Harmonica solo]

[Verse 3]
Let's get high on the happy
With a toast to you and me
Love is here just for the giving
And between us we've got all the love we'll ever need

[Chorus]
As if you read my mind
As if you touched my soul
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go
As if you read my mind
As if you touched my soul
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go
As if you read my mind
As if you touched my soul
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go
As if you read my mind
As if you touched my soul
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go

[Verse 1]
Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

[Chorus]
Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
You would be jamming and jamming and jamming, jam on

[Verse 2]
They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
Because we've only just begun

[Chorus]
Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
You would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I know nobody told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the the break of dawn
We're jammin', jammin', jammin' jam on

[Verse 3]
You ask me am I happy
Well as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
Because we all just made a pact
We've agreed to get together
Joined as children in Jah
When you're moving in the positive
Your destination is the brightest star

[Chorus]
You didn't know that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Don't you stop the music, oh no
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Na, na na...
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Nobody told you Oh, Oh, Oh, you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet you if someone approached you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Yesterday to tell you that you would be jammin' you would not believe it because you never thought that you would be jammin'
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Jammin' 'til the break of dawn
Oh, Oh, Oh, You may as well believe what you are feeling
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Because you feel your body jammin'
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Oh, Oh, you would be jammin' until the break of dawn
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')

[Verse 1]
Since age one Keita knew he had the answer
And it was that someday he'd be a dancer
And with help from his sis
Surely that boy would not miss
From being the baddest dancer in the whole neighborhood
Late at night when he was supposed to be sleeping
You could hear the pitter patter of feet creeping
To where music would play
To his sister he would say
Before his father said, "Hey boy, get right back in that bed"

[Chorus]
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it, oh oh
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you, hey

[Verse 2]
Once at school they put on a talent contest
To find out who could really boogie the best
But his mama said, N"o
Keita's much too young to go"
But his sister said, "Please let him go so the world can see"
When they saw him they said, "He must be crazy
Look at him, he ain't nothing but a baby"
But soon as he began
You knew the contest he would win
Because everyone in the audience began to cheer

[Chorus]
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it, oh oh oh oh
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you, hey, oh

Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Please show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you, yeah

[Outro dialogue]
- Ooh, you done broke mama's lamp
- Unh-uh
- Yes, you did
- No, I didn't
Yes, you did

[Stevie Wonder]
You just could not know how long we tried
To see how this building looks inside
This must be a lucky day for me
Because the sign says there's a vacancy

[Apartment owner]
Look I know you came a long way
But you made it just too late
So we had to give it to somebody else

[Stevie]
Well I talked to you on the phone less than fifteen minutes ago
And you told me that it was cool
I graduated from Howard U
My job is paying good money too
And if you check on my resume
You'll find they all wanted me to stay

[Owner]
Well I can't take the time out
To check your credit card
‘Cause the computer just broke down today

[Stevie]
Well I'll stop by here tomorrow to complete our interview
But I know what you're gonna say
I know what your bottom line is

[Hook: Owner]
You might have the cash
But you can not cash in your face
We don't want you living in here
Say you might have the cash
But you can not cash in your face
We don't want your kind living in here
Too bad, too sad

[Stevie]
Our first child is due here any day
That's why we're desperate for a place to stay
The location is so perfect too
So please try to do what you can do

[Owner]
Well in this apartment complex no children are allowed
And if you told me that I could have saved you a lot of time

[Stevie]
Well I thought the bill was passed that said you could not discriminate
But I know some excuse you'll find
Because your bottom line is

[Hook: Owner]
You might have the cash
But you can not cash in your face
We don't want you living in here
Say you might have the cash
But you can not cash in your face
We don't want your kind living in here
Too bad, too sad

[Bridge: Owner]
Aye, you might be a great doctor
You might be a great lawyer
You might possess the key to the city
Or may be a politician

[Hook: Owner]
You might have the cash
But you can not cash in your face
We don't want you living in here
Say you might have the cash
But you can not cash in your face
We don't want your kind living in here
Too bad, too sad

[Chorus]
Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
I want to ride my
Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride my bike
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride it where I like

[Verse 1]
You say black, I say white
You say bark, I say bite
You say shark, I say, hey, man
Jaws was never my scene
And I don't like Star Wars
You say Rolls, I say Royce
You say God, Give me a choice!
You say Lord, I say, Christ!
I don't believe in Peter Pan
Frankenstein or Superman
All I wanna do is

[Chorus]
Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
I want to ride my
Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride my bike
I want to ride my bicycle

Bicycle races are coming your way
So forget all your duties, oh yeah
Fat bottomed girls
They'll be riding today
So look out for those beauties, oh yeah
On your marks! Get set! Go!
Bicycle race, bicycle race, bicycle race

[Chorus]
Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
I want to ride my
Bicycle, bicycle
Bicycle, bicycle
Bicycle, bicycle race
(I want a bicycle race)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Hey! You say coke, I say 'caine
You say John, I say Wayne
Hot dog, I say, Cool it man
I don't wanna be
The President of America
You say smile, I say cheese
Cartier, I say please
Income tax, I say Jesus
I don't wanna be a candidate
For Vietnam or Watergate
'Cause all I want to do is

[Chorus]
Bicycle, (Yeah) bicycle, (Hey) bicycle
I want to ride my
Bicycle, bicycle, (Come on!) bicycle
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride my bike
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride it where I like

[Verse 1: Lindsey Buckingham]
Loving you isn't the right thing to do
How can I ever change things that I feel?
If I could, maybe I'd give you my world
How can I when you won't take it from me?

[Chorus: Fleetwood Mac and Lindsey Buckingham]
You can go your own way, go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way, go your own way

[Verse 2: Lindsey Buckingham]
Tell me why everything turned around
Packing up, shacking up's all you wanna do
If I could, baby, I'd give you my world
Open up, everything's waiting for you

[Chorus: Fleetwood Mac]
You can go your own way, go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way, go your own way

[Solo 1]

[Chorus: Fleetwood Mac]
You can go your own way, go your own way
You can call it another lonely day, another lonely day
You can go your own way, go your own way
You can call it another lonely day

[Solo 2]

[Outro: Fleetwood Mac]
You can go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way

[Verse 1]
Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging
'Round my mind

Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask, "Will you be coming back soon?"
You don't know, never know

[Chorus]
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
‘Cause they always start to cry
‘Cause this time could mean goodbye

[Verse 2]
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason
With your heart
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts you're keeping
You just say nothing's changed

[Chorus]
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
‘Cause they always start to cry
‘Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye
Oh, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
‘Cause they always start to cry
‘Cause this time could mean goodbye

[Verse 1]
You know it doesn't make much sense
There ought to be a law against
Anyone who takes offense
At a day in your celebration
'Cause we all know in our minds
That there ought to be a time
That we can set aside
To show just how much we love you
And I'm sure you would agree
It couldn't fit more perfectly
Than to have a world party on the day you came to be

[Chorus]
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

[Verse 2]
I just never understood
How a man who died for good
Could not have a day that would
Be set aside for his recognition
Because it should never be
Just because some cannot see
The dream as clear as he
That they should make it become an illusion
And we all know everything
That he stood for time will bring
For in peace our hearts will sing
Thanks to Martin Luther King

[Chorus]
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

[Bridge]
Why has there never been a holiday
Where peace is celebrated
All throughout the world

[Verse 3]
The time is overdue
For people like me and you
Who know the way to truth
Is love and unity to all God's children
It should be a great event
And the whole day should be spent
In full remembrance
Of those who lived and died for the oneness of all people
So let us all begin
We know that love can win
Let it out, don't hold it in
Sing it loud as you can

[Chorus]
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

[Bridge 2]
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Ooh yeah
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday...

[Outro]
We know the key to unity of all people
Is in the dream that you had so long ago
That lives in all of the hearts of people
That believe in unity
We'll make the dream become a reality
I know we will
Because our hearts tell us so

Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday

[Vocals: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]

[Verse 1]
I know I stand in line until you think you have the time to spend an evening with me
And if we go some place to dance, I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me

[Chorus 1]
Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"
I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies you heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before

[Verse 2]
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late, and I'm alone with you

[Chorus 2]
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"

[Chorus 2]
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"

[Outro]
"I love you"
"I love you"
"I love you"
"I love you"
"I love you"

[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Verse 2]
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

[Pre-Chorus]
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Outro]
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me
It’s 6 pm on Friday, and I’m writing to a few thousand friends I have not met yet.

I am writing to ask them to change our plans and meet a little while later. Here’s the thing.

I have a dog Janet, and she’s been ill for almost two years now, as a tumor has been idling in her chest, growing ever so slowly. She’s almost 14 years old now. I got her when she was 4 months old. I was 21 then, an adult officially – and she was my child.

She is a pitbull, and was found in Echo Park, with a rope around her neck, and bites all over her ears and face. She was the one the dogfighters use to puff up the confidence of the contenders.

She’s almost 14 and I've never seen her start a fight, or bite, or even growl, so I can understand why they chose her for that awful role. She’s a pacifist.

Janet has been the most consistent relationship of my adult life, and that is just a fact. We’ve lived in numerous houses, and jumped a few make shift families, but it’s always really been the two of us.

She slept in bed with me, her head on the pillow, and she accepted my hysterical, tearful face into her chest, with her paws around me, every time I was heartbroken, or spirit-broken, or just lost, and as years went by, she let me take the role of her child, as I fell asleep, with her chin resting above my head.

She sat next to me when I wrote songs, and barked any time I tried to record something, and she was with me in the studio, all the time we recorded the last album.

The last time I came back from tour, she was spry as ever, and she’s used to me being gone for a few weeks every 6 or 7 years. She has Addison’s Disease, which makes it dangerous for her to go on the road with me, since she needs regular injections of Cortisol, because she reacts to stress and to excitement without the physiological tools which keep most of us from literally panicking to death.

Despite all of this, she’s effortlessly joyful and playful, and only stopped acting like a puppy about 3 years ago. She’s my best friend and my mother and my daughter, and my benefactor, and she’s the one who taught me what love is.

I can’t come to South America. Not now. When I got back from the last leg of the US tour, there was a big, big difference. She doesn't even want to go for walks anymore.
I know that she’s not sad about aging or dying. Animals may well have a survival instinct, but a sense of mortality and vanity, they do not. That’s why they are so much more present than most people. But I know that she is coming close to point where she will stop being a dog, and instead, be part of everything. She’ll be in the wind, and in the soil, and the snow, and in me, wherever I go. I can’t leave her now, please understand. If I go away again, I’m afraid she’ll die and I won’t have the honor of singing her to sleep, of escorting her out. Maybe she’ll fool me, and live for a couple more years–maybe I’ll lose my potential friends, in places I feel a longing to know.

Sometimes it takes me 20 minutes to pick which socks to wear to bed. But this decision is instant. These are the choices we make, which define us. I am not the woman who puts her career ahead of love and friendship. I’m the woman who stays home, and bakes Tilapia for my dearest, oldest friend. And helps her be comfortable, and comforted, and safe, and important. Many of us these days, we dread the ‘death’ of a loved one. It is the ugly truth of life, that leaves us feeling terrified and alone. I wish we could also appreciate the time that lies right beside the end of time. I know that I will feel the most overwhelming knowledge of her, and of her life, and of my love for her, in the last moments. I need to do my damnedest to be there for that. Because it will be the most beautiful, the most intense, the most enriching experience of life I've ever known. When she dies. So I am staying home, and I am listening to her snore and wheeze, and reveling in the swampiest, most awful breath that ever emanated from an angel. And I am asking for your blessing.

I’ll be seeing you.
Love, Fiona

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

[Bridge: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh-oh

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

[Outro: Taylor Swift & Colbie Caillat]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Mmm)
I'm sorry, (Yeah, yeah) I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry

[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes"

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go," and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes"

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

[Breakdown]
And I said, "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said

[Chorus]
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'"

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

[Verse 1]
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know, I haven't seen you around before"

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

[Verse 2]
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

[Bridge]
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen

[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la

[Outro]
Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

[Verse 1]
There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly making me want you

[Chorus]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Verse 3]
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this one horse town, I wanna stay right here
In this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Bridge]
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

[Verse 2]
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

[Bridge]
And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday, who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

[Outro]
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now, oh
It's too late to catch me now

[Verse 1]
And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

[Chorus]
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this

[Chorus]
'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
Tonight we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

[Chorus]
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Verse 1]
I used to know this dude, pretty lou' out in LA
Said when I’m in LA, to hit up his cell-ay
Cause he got something nice he wanna put in my belly
He wanna bump and grind sorta like R. Kelly
See money ain’t a thang, 'cause my doe is like woah
Pull out my bank roll on a nigga like "yo!"
Let’s make some videos, get the Benny Boom crew
I’m hoppin out the Rov in my Jimmy Choo shoe
I’m the boss bitch, you know I like to talk shit
I’m heavy in the streets, so you gon’ need a forklift
And, daddy, lemme cum in your mouth like the dentist

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, we ain’t gotta talk, we could bone
Soon as we all alone
Then, baby, I’ma get you in the zone
‘Cause you think we’re all the same
But you’re wrong
Just get me some patron
And, baby, I’ma get you in the zone

Get them strawberries, bring another whipped cream in

Soon as we all alone

‘Cause you think we’re all the same
But you’re wrong
Just get me some patron
And, baby, I’ma get you in the zone

[Chorus]

C'mon, yeah

[Verse 1]
Everybody's looking for love, oh (Woo, huh)
Ain't that the reason you're at this club? Oh (Huh)
You ain't gon' find it dancing with him, no (No)
I've got a better solution for you, girl, oh (Huh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Just leave with me now, say the word and we'll go (And we'll go)
I'll be your teacher, I'll show you the ropes (You the ropes)
You'll see the side of love you've never known
I can see it going down, going down

[Chorus]
In my head, I see you all over me
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy
In my head, you'll be screaming loud
In my head, it's going down
In my head, it's going down
In my head, yeah
In my head, oh, yeah, c'mon

[Verse 2]
Some dudes know all the right things to say, ayy (Ayy, uh)
When it comes down to it, it's all just game said
Instead of talking, let me demonstrate, yeah (Yeah)
Get down to business and skip foreplay (Foreplay, ayy, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Just leave with me now, say the word and we'll go (We can go)
I'll be your teacher, I'll show you the ropes (You the ropes)
You'll see the side of love you've never known (Never known)
I can see it going down, going down

[Chorus]
In my head, I see you all over me (Baby, all over me)
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy (Fulfill my fantasy)
In my head, you'll be screaming loud
In my head, it's going down
In my head, it's going down
In my head

[Bridge]
Break it down (Ayo, ayo), c'mon on, let's go (Ayo)
You're singing to me, baby, in my head right now

She'll be screaming out when it all goes down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just leave with me now, say the word and we'll go (And we'll go)
I'll be your teacher, I'll show you the ropes (You the ropes)
You'll see the side of love you've never known (Never known)

In my head, you'll be screaming loud (Oh, oh)
In my head, it's going down (In my head)
In my head, it's going down
It's going down in my head

[Verse 1]
It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling, "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

[Pre-Chorus]
But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

[Chorus]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh, man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man, wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

[Verse 2]
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

[Pre-Chorus]
But the film is a saddening bore
Because I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

[Chorus]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh, man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man, wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

[Chorus]
Let me take you to the land of wonder, we can wander
Undercover, secret lovers, ay heyyy ("And ohh you're gonna love me")
("You're gonna wanna hug me, and") squeeze, squeeze, squeeze me
Let me take you to the land of wonder, we can wander
Undercover, secret lovers, ay heyyy ("And ohh you're gonna love me")
("You're gonna wanna hug me, and") squeeze, squeeze, squeeze me

[Verse One] 

[Snoop Dogg]:
Hmm, and I ain't never felt like this
I ain't never met a girl with the right mix
Green eyes, light-skinned with some nice tits
It took a minute just to write this
I'm the Boss Dogg baby!
I'ma die rich
So let the money talk for me, fuck the nonsense
Hold me down, be my ride or die bitch
We fuck then we fight, we fight then we fuck
I'ma beat it up tonight like Kimbo Slice
Come live the proper life, no I ain't the shoppin' type
I might take you out to eat, we can grab a bite
Now let me grab my bike and roll yo' ass through Crescent Heights
Up in Hollywood, step into the limelight
And hit this bubble kush, let me get your mind right
This is "Wonderland," let your mind take flight
We gotta hurry up, I'm only here for one night

[Chorus]
Let me take you to the land of wonder, we can wander
Undercover, secret lovers, ay heyyy ("And ohh you're gonna love me")
("You're gonna wanna hug me, and") squeeze, squeeze, squeeze me
Let me take you to the land of wonder, we can wander
Undercover, secret lovers, ay heyyy ("And ohh you're gonna love me")
("You're gonna wanna hug me, and") squeeze, squeeze, squeeze me

[Verse Two] 

[Snoop Dogg]:
This next girl Bird, she from the suburbs
And live by herself, like cars and nice furs
And loves hip-hop, The Neptunes and Murs
But I'm her favorite rapper, my biggest fan is her
I like her skin tone, and how her figure curves
We smoke mad kush and drink until our vision blur
And then I pat her down, like she gettin' searched
I fuck her with my chain on, she pulls on my shirt
Like nigga don't stop, until the pussy squirt
I hit it twice and bone out, she went back to work
This happens all the time, I gotta go rehearse
For my next show, I tour on May 1st
Get yo' mind right, and this may work
You know love is pain, and havin' faith hurts
You rollin' with the best, so grab your heels and purse
And welcome to "Wonderland" the best place on Earth
Uhh, you gon' love me
("And ohh you're gonna love me")
("You're gonna wanna hug me, and") squeeze, squeeze, squeeze me

[Chorus]
Let me take you to the land of wonder, we can wander
Undercover, secret lovers, ay heyyy ("And ohh you're gonna love me")
("You're gonna wanna hug me, and") squeeze, squeeze, squeeze me
Let me take you to the land of wonder, we can wander
Undercover, secret lovers, ay heyyy ("And ohh you're gonna love me")
("You're gonna wanna hug me, and") squeeze, squeeze, squeeze me

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, It's 10 O'Clock on a Wednesday and I know your home (Know your home)
Driving up and down your street hoping you that come outside (Come outside)
Cause I just got paid and I'm winning bout to call you on it (Call you on it)
And I just need you to see me, oh, oh (Oh, oh)
Charlie says it seems that will make it all better (Better)
Selfish says it is, this just ain’t bout you, no (bout you, no)
Did me wrong every time we were together, gether
So that’s why, I’m gonna stunt on you

You let me go, little did you know

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yessir, Weezy F. Baby, ya

Baby, I'm tryin' to do numbers like a yellow page
When I was 14 I told my ma we will see better days
And sure enough I got Ms. Cita in a better place

On the eastside we all blood, we all family, never Di-vide
Keep my knees high in my levi, Now, don't fuck up my de-sign

Yeah, ya' understands me, Mack they gonna' respect me

[Hook](x2)

When the levees broke, when the planes hit
What's going on my nigga? You know the same shit
After Katrina, after the towers
We hold our heads high, after disaster
When the levees broke, when the planes hit
What's going on my nigga? The same shit
After Katrina, after the towers
We hold our heads high, after disaster

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne, Juelz Santana]
They couldn't kill me, holla if you feel me
Hurricane Katrina victim in the building
Okay, daytime soldier, nighttime rider (rider)
9/11 survivor, holla (Yeah, I feel you)
And who am I to try to keep hope alive
When I'm seeing dead babies floating by
Damn, burning buildings, flamed up (up)
They couldn't take the heat so they jumped (jumped)
Man, they want to want to transform the streets we grew up on
A deck of cards with no aces: luck gone
Uhh, tower 1 fell (fell), tower 2 fell (fell)
Now everybody screwed like loose nails
I'm like what are we to do with a house with no roof
Look up and pray to whose above You
God, now just look in your seat
Black people, white people, all covered in debris
Yeah

[Hook: Juelz Santana, Lil Wayne]

After Katrina, after the towers
We hold our heads high, after disaster

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana, Lil Wayne]
Yeah, we try to keep our head up, and not get fed up (nope)
But it seems like they won't let us, live
And I was told that life ain't shit and this world ain't neither
That's why I scream fuck the world not the people (nope)
Yes, but in the Belly of the Beast
People get swallowed like meat, eat
And your president was lying while my people was dying
In the helicopter flying, looking down reading signs
(Help!) SOS, somebody save us!
Ten dead inside, where our savior?
And, I've seen tragedy I've looked it in the eye
Hate being at my lowest so I choose to get high (high)
So high, that my name should be sky
It's a bird, it's a plane, no it's I
Yea, I holla 504 till they bury me man
I'm the father of New Orleans and I'm a family man
You heard me

[Hook: Juelz Santana, Lil Wayne]
When the levees broke, when the planes hit
What's going on my nigga? You know the same shit
After Katrina, after the towers

After Katrina, after the towers
We hold our heads high, after disaster

[Verse 3: Juelz Santana, Lil Wayne]
Now, if I should die before my time, Lord
Take care of Ju Ju and his mom (please)
Take care of little Jah (please), take care all the kids (please)
Cause through us they live
Yeah, Lord please keep Your eyes on me
And if I die, I pray my soul You keep
And I don't want this world to kill me, but I'm getting so weak
I can't take much more, I just want to be free (free)
They said they knew there was a problem with the levees, and they did nothing (nothing)
Clinton approved the money, Bush did nothing (nothing)
So, Katrina hit (hit), and three days later, Fema just coming
Ain't this something?
I'm feeling like what the hell is really going on
Planes into buildings, what's next, King Kong?
I wish we didn't even have a reason for this song (but we do)
Moment of silence for the people that's gone (Shhhhh)
To those resting in peace
Those dead and deceased, soon again we meet (soon)
Or 'til I'm high and drunk and my car swerves off road (Ha)
I'll meet you at the crossroads (yep)
Lord please keep Your eyes on me
And if I die, I pray my soul You keep
And I don't want this world to kill me, but I'm getting so weak
I can't take much more, I just want to be free

[Hook: Juelz Santana, Lil Wayne]

And my watch reminds me of '88
Because I got crack rocks in the watch face
Bitches stick to me like scotch tape
Plenty colors in da chain nigga fuck Bape
Yea, bitch I'm cold like up-state
So icy like a motherfuckin' cupcake
Ya, these hoes feel my feng shui
And wanna eat me alive I'm like an entrée

[Hook]
Everytime I do it, I do my thang
Do my thang, my motherfuckin' thang
And everytime I do it, I do my thing

And everytime I do it, I do my thing

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Santana bandana on tilt
Back seat with the heat, I'm warmer than a quilt
They lookin at me like they drink spoiled milk
Money tall: Jack and Jill
Like they sittin' on a hill
Ice on the neck of me, ice on the wrist of me
Ice in both hands bitch I'm lit like a Christmas tree
Different color stones you could call it a mystery
Big dookie rope, you would think they was lynchin' me
Chain on top of chain man I look like Mr. T
I pity the fool the day he try to get with me
Fresh Prince, got banks like Hilary
And I hit docks with the hickory dickory
I make the girls run fast like Benny Hill
Rims go round and round you can call them my Ferris wheels
Pockets full of bank rolls, money long as train smoke
And it come faster than a nigga fuckin' J-Lo
I don't play games I shoot it up like Halo
Got more paper than your job's got payroll
Still I'm ghetto like no frills
I clean the dirt out my nails 100 dollar bills

[Hook]
Everytime I do it, I do my thang
Do my thang, my motherfuckin' thang
And everytime I do it, I do my thing

And a bird can fly until u can't see his wings (haha)
Big car
Big rims

We gettin money over here you need to get some
Out comes the cold steel for my income

[Juelz Santana]
Out comes the cold steel for my victims
Born alone, die alone, but you could die with em
Cars white and sexy like Nicole Kidman
Bad chick by my side, video vixen
Might fly to L.A. just to shop at Kitson
Thousand dollar hoodies I'm pickin up about 15
That's about 15 thousand
I'm trickin zero on bitches
Zero
Zavosky crystals, great china wall
My money run longer than the great china wall
And my pockets is mediterranean sea deep
So keep plottin and prayin to get me
Come on

[Juelz Santana:]
I'm just a rocka dude
Lookin for my rocka girl
Baby I'll rock your boat
Rock your bed, and rock your world
But you gotta be as fly as me
You gotta know how to rock your stuff
VH1 Brett Michael, Be my rock of love
VS 1, big stones
Lemme rock ya
Maybe marriage, baby carriage
Lemme knock ya up
I could be your rocka daddy
You could be my rocka mommy
I could your chilly pepper
You could be my hot tamale
Have your ever made love to a rockstar?
In a hot car with the top off
In the middle of a parkin lot
You don't care who see, who look, or who watch ya
Pretty face
And the body soft as baby skin
She hopped on me and rode
I thought my name was Harley Davidson

[Girl:]
You got your tattoos
I got my tattoos too
We stay up all night and do what rockstars do
We got the music
Bumpin thru the system
The room is real smoky
Highlights in a mansion
We lovin all night
We sleepin all day
Wake up and hit the mall
Stay fresh and rock our way
They try to imitate us
They could never duplicate us
Pull up in the Ferrari
Saying hello to all my haters

[Hook: x2]
Have you ever made love
To a rockstar
In a hot car
With his guitar, playing on the side
Have. you. ever. made. love

[Girl:]
You drive a fast car
I drive a fast car too
Suicide doors with the topless roof
Now we're cruisin
Glasses on the face
Cus he ducking paparazzi, they high speed chasin
We got a maserati but we drivin in a range
Cus we don't give a damn
Switch rides by the day, day, day
Now this is what I call rockstar love
This was the question I was thinkin of

[Hook: x2]
Have you ever made love
To a rockstar
In a hot car
With his guitar, playing on the side
Have. you. ever. mad. love

[Lil Wayne:]

I met her in Victoria's
She was hotter than a crown victoria
On my block on a friday at 6:00 yep

I tried to tell her my name but laughed more so
Because she looked like tell me somethin I don't kno
So I told her my number and I got hers also
And of course she knew I had a girl, I wouldn't be in the store
So we hooked up that morning like around 4
And at that time I knew what she was down for
Yep
Soon as the door opened, war opened out
She was such a soldier, purple heart pokin out of her fatigues, and she's never fatigued
And with her, whatever I say she believes
And my girl know I got a magic show up my sleeve
But with her, I can disappear when I need
And she say...

[Hook]
She don't even care about my girlfriend
She said she just wanna do the thang with me
And who am I to tell that girl no when this world is so cold, why should I be

She said she just wanna do her thang with me
And she gonna do her thang with me, with me

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]

She got that coke bottle ill shape
Thicker than a McDonald's milkshake
We don't go on dates, we have field days
She let me play on her field like a bill's game
And she don't even like football, she just sits home
But she love it when I run it in her inzone
She love to role play and put them wigs on
Yeah, she be gettin her lil' kim on
With me, she can be as freaky as she is, but with him she gotta be as sneaky as she is
And with her, I can be as kinky as I'm gonna be
Upside down, handstand's how I wanna be
She said...

[Hook:]
She don't even care about her boyfriend
She said she just wanna do the thang with a g
And who is he to tell that girl no when this world is so cold, why should he be

She said she just wanna do her thang with a g
And she gonna do her thang with a g, with a g

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Shh...
D-Boy in the B-U-I-L-ding
He who buy and sell things
Feds hear my cell ring
Phone we say ice cream
Home we say white (Hello)
In jail they don't say too much the codes ain't safe enough
So i'll be on the street and on the road gettin' my paper up
Full but I ain't ate enough
I'm good but I ain't great enough (Uh Uh)
Aye tru turn the faders up
I'm waking up I'm taking up the industries space and I'm wastin' 'em (Yea)
They can't look me in my face and I'm grillin' 'em (Bling)
How my smile worth a million (Ha)
Because diamons are forever
Pluck a diamond from the bezel
Feel the clarity that twinkle on the little one

[Hook: Lil Wayne & Nikki Jean]
Aye
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' it

Aye what is this feeling?

And the dope boys (Yea)

It's more money involved
Yea
More money more problems
More problems to solve
Big Gleezy got 'em (Gleezy!)
Ask a nigga have I ever been in the back of a car
Lookin' for other niggas after dark (Lil' Tune)
They'll tell you whats up
I ain't bad as fuck but I'm tough enough
That's why...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
People try to tell me shit but I don't want to hear 'em
Cause if I tell 'em shit back

Truth be told I'm the hottest of my era
There will never be a soul that can compare to every level
Ever peddeled by the Devil
Me being the Devil
Yep
Hot Boy 'till the grizzle
Gone 'till they miss me
And thats untill the blunts burn out
And the liquor is empty
I ain't trippin' cause I did me
Wait I'm trippin' cause I'm still me
Still the little nigga goin' out to get me
If the public got something to say
Well tell them I got something to say
And that is...

[Tommy Mara]
You Know While Your Mother Is Cooking The Macaronni
Today I Figured Id Sit Down And Talk To You Since Your Old Enough
You Know Its Time That You Really Realize What This Family Is All About
Cause About This Time Is When Your Gonna Be Able To Join In
And Earn Some Real Money And Real Cash But Before You Do That
I Wanna Teach You A Little Bit About Loyalty
The Main Name Of This Game Is Respect And Loyalty
Family Is A Big Thing When We Do This Kind Of Business
Everything Is With Respect And When A Family Member Gets Outta
Line And Another Family Dont Like It One Thing Leads To Another
And The Next Thing You Know, Your Gone And Then Your Just A Memory Of Me
My Hearts Broke Then, But You Gotta Remember Theres Always Family And Loyalty
Loyalty Is The Main Thing. Obviously You Know I Dont Make My Money
I Dont Make All My Cash From Uh Construction Jobs We Do And
Uh Sanitation And Private Stuff Is All Earned Money Through The Family
And Since Your Of Age Now I Think Its Time I

Taught You What Coming Into The Family And Respect Is All About
So The First Thing You Gotta Learn Is The Name Respect
Tha Means You Dont Cross Nobody You Dont Go Over The Line
Once You Go Over That Line Theres No Coming Back Whether
Youre A Member Of The Family Or Not
Thats When People Get Whacked And We Dont Want Nobody Whacked In Our Family
So I Gotta Teach You The Proper Way Of Respect
When Youre Earning Money, Everybody Earns, Everybody Eats Bread
Its All About Cash Money Thats What Its All About Making The Money
So The First Thing Of Business Is This, You Remember Your Name
You Dont Forgets Your Roots
You Never Ever Disrespect Anyone Thats Above You Especially Your Capo
Especially The Big Time Guys, Those Are The Guys You Listen To
You Never Ever Disrespect Anyone Unless Your Told To Unless You Get The Okay
And If There Is No Sit Down Theres Nothing

And I can't believe he's always out every night and never checks in
Is he cheating? Man, I don't know
I'm looking 'round for something else to throw

[Chorus]
I'm breakin' dishes up in here, all night (Uh-huh)
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights (Uh-huh)
I'ma fight a man tonight, I'ma fight a man tonight
I'ma fight a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man, oh

[Bridge]
I don't know who you think I am (I am, I am, I am, I am)
(I don't know who you think I am)
But I really don't give a damn right now
If you don't come, I'ma huff and puff and blow this, blow this, oh
Blow this, blow this, I'ma blow this, blow this, oh
Blow this, blow this, I'ma blow this, blow this, oh
Blow this house, house down
Dishes, breakin' dishes, breakin' dishes

[Chorus]
I'm breakin' dishes up in here, all night (Uh-huh)
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights (Uh-huh)
I'ma fight a man tonight, I'ma fight a man tonight
I'ma fight a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man

[Outro]
Breakin', breakin', breakin', breakin' (Dishes, dishes, dishes)
Breakin', breakin', breakin', breakin' (Dishes, dishes, dishes)
Breakin', breakin', breakin', breakin' (Dishes, dishes, dishes)
Breakin', breakin', breakin', breakin' (Dishes, dishes, dishes)

They say "Nicki, you the best!", and I tell them "Uh, dur!" (Oh)
You tell me what I know, I guess I must concur (Okay)
I'm the reason why these bitches yelling, "Fuck her!" (Yes Sir!)
'Cause everybody hate when you're great and you're caking (Why is that?)
And when I say caking, I ain't talking 'bout baking (Oh, okay)
But they gon' get it all wrong (Oh)

‘Cause you ain't getting chips unless you count then Bon Tons (Hahahaha)

[Outro]
How the only chips you got is Bon Ton potato chips?
Like, that's what I don't understand, I try to tell these niggas, like, you can't be serious

[Verse 1]
All is fair in love
Love's a crazy game
Two people vow to stay
In love as one they say
But all is changed with time
The future none can see
The road you leave behind
Ahead lies mystery

[Chorus]
But all is fair in love
I had to go away
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair

[Verse 2]
All of fate's a chance
It's either good or bad
I tossed my coin to say
In love with me you'd stay
But all in war is so cold
You either win or lose
When all is put away
The losing side I'll play

[Chorus]
But all is fair in love
I should never have left your side
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair

[Outro]
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair

[Verse 1: T.I.]
My cup runneth over with pinot grigio, hol' up
You bogus in the Lambo if you ain't lifting the door up
You bogus poppin' pills if you ain't pickin the ho up
You bogus running out on your kids, my nigga, grow up
For God's sake, like a wedding, cutting large cake
For large stakes, let the hammer bang, broad day
Ayy, never mind what the blogs say
This what my mind and my heart say
My philosophy: profit off of my properties
Get it, flip it, we got to be rich, that broke shit is obsolete
Possibly off of my rocker, watch how you watching me
Sophisticated, psychotic, fly as a pilot
Officially solid, all you wish you could get—I got it
Unlimited titanium, nigga, what's in your wallet?
Out of gladiator college, I made it summa cum laude
Where you clowns couldn't have got a cap and gown if you bought it
I parlay with Saudis, buying crude oil and diamonds
Hustle January, July, fly to Dubai
A broke nigga telling me 'bout how I'm dividing the pies
Like a blind nigga telling me it's an eye for an eye
Bullheaded and stubborn, I'll be that way 'til I die
But find a nigga with more hustle than me—I dare you to try
And according to the hand on my Audemars (Audemars)
It's my time to shine, so fuck y'all (Fuck y'all)

[Chorus: Stacy Barthe]
What should I be sorry for?
Who should I be sorry to?
What should I be sorry for?
Who should I be sorry to?
The fact is you can't please everybody
You can't please everybody
What should I be sorry for?
Who should I be sorry to?

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I grew up in the gutter, life a motherfucker
I guess that's why I don't trust a motherfucker
Seen a nigga snitch on they mom, shoot at his brother
Go to prison, in love with a bitch, and a nigga fuck her
I seen real Gs destroyed by real suckers
Innocent ladies raped and defenseless babies abducted
Such a horrible truth, but you see it over and over
It's nothing; you numb to it, and your heart grow colder
Pacify your pain with a chain and a Rover
Fuck it; justify your action with stacking your dough up
He show up with a brick of cocaine and baking soda
Just enough for me to blow up; nigga, hold up
Switch the flow up, 'cause these niggas be snitching so much
I promise all they missing's a badge, coffee, and donut
Go to jail—so what? Never see my integrity perish
That ain't the Harris' way, study my pedigree
Promise I'm one of the only ones who keep it a hundred
Prol'ly why I think they all out to get me, you can't convince me
Large money and fame will plant seeds of envy
To make my partners resent me enough to come and get me
Catch me slipping and hit me just like they did 50
'Cause I'm in the position that he think he should be given
Listen, dawg, the fact of the matter is
I'm on a narrow path and we all can't travel

[Chorus: Stacy Barthe]
What should I be sorry for?
Who should I be sorry to?
What should I be sorry for?
Who should I be sorry to?
The fact is you can't please everybody
You can't please everybody
What should I be sorry for?
Who should I be sorry to?

[Verse 3: André 3000]
What it ain't? What it is?
Even if you gotta live
I learned that apartment's way more exciting
Than a big-ass house on a hill
I used to be a way better writer and a rapper
When I used to want a black Karmann Ghia (Woo!)
Now a nigga speeding in a Porsche (Ahh)
Feeling like I'm going off a course (Ahh)
Cut these fuck niggas off
Negative in my life, scream that 'til I'm hoarse (Woo)
Duck these, get the fuck off me, projectiles
Bitch, he ain't really got a choice (Mmm)
I'm living my life live yours (Ahh)
I don't even like rapping fast (Ahh)
But that's how the world come to me
Talk to me sideways, nigga, that's your ass
Slow it down
This that shit that'll make you call your mama
Say, "Hey, I'm sorry for begging
For all them clothes you couldn't afford"
And this the type of shit that'll make you call your rap partner
And say, "I'm sorry I'm awkward, my fault for fuckin' up the tours"
I hated all the attention so I ran from it (I ran from it)
Fuck it if we did
But I hope we ain't lose no fans from it (No fans from it)
I'm a grown-ass kid, you know
I ain't never cared about no damn money
Why do we try so hard to be stars just to dodge comments?
And this that shit that'll make you call your baby mama
When you gone on half a pill
Don't know why, but that's how it is
Then you take a flight back to the crib
Y'all make love like college kids
And you say all the shit you gon' do better
We can try this shit again
'Round the time the dope wear off
You feel stupid, she feel lost
That's that dopamine, I mean dope—
I mean, you think Cupid done worn off
Waiting in the hallway with her arms crossed
Baby boy face full of applesauce
Maybe should have stayed but it ain't yo fault
Too much pressure, I peel off, I'm sorry
Was young and had to choose between you
And what the rest of the world might offer me
Shit, what would you do? (I was 21)
Well, I'd prob'ly do it differently if second the chance
Only if some cool-ass older man
Would've let me know in advance
There's this quarry that is dug so deep in a father's chest
When he feel that he's broken up his nest
And he figures, shit—he was just doing the best that he could
Which end up being the worst that he could
And all some pussy nigga on the Internet can say
Is, "That verse ain't good"

[Break: André 3000]
It's boring? Boring?
Really? Hahahaha

[Bridge: André 3000]
When I'm disgusted with this world and
I can hardly breathe and
Told so many lies, I don't know what to believe
I discussed it with this girl and this is what she said
She said, "Lay down, baby, baby, rest your weary head," ugh
A lovely distraction, but my mind don't wanna rest
But my body disagree, so I laid up on her breast, yes
"Ooooh, you so fucking fine," I
Woke up the next morning with new purpose on my mind
"Ooooh, who pulls your ponytail?
Who knows your body well, huh?"

[Outro: Stacy Barthe]
What should I be sorry for?
Who should I be sorry to?

[Intro]
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love

[Verse 1]
From the very first time I blessed my eyes on you, girl
My heart says follow through
But I know, now, that I'm way down on your line
But the waitin' feel is fine
So don't treat me like a puppet on a string
Cause I know how to do my thing
Don't talk to me as if you think I'm dumb
I wanna know when you're gonna come, see

[Chorus]
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
Cause if summer is here
I'm still waiting there
Winter is here
And I'm still waiting there

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 2]
Like I said:
It's been three years since I'm knockin' on your door
And I still can knock some more
Cuckoo girl, cuckoo girl, is it feasible?
I wanna know now, for I to knock some more
Ya see, in life I know there's lots of grief
But your love is my relief
Tears in my eyes burn - tears in my eyes burn
While I'm waiting - while I'm waiting for my turn
See!

[Chorus]
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love, oh!

[Outro]
I don't wanna - I don't wanna - I don't wanna - I don't wanna -
I don't wanna wait in vain
I don't wanna - I don't wanna - I don't wanna - I don't wanna -
I don't wanna wait in vain
No, I don't wanna (I don't wanna - I don't wanna - I don't wanna -
I don't wanna - I don't wanna wait in vain) -
No I - no I (I don't wanna - I don't wanna - I don't wanna - I don't
Wanna - I don't wanna wait in vain) -
No, no-no, I, no, I (I don't wanna - I don't wanna - I don't wanna -
I don't wanna - I don't wanna wait in vain) -
It's your love that I'm waiting on (I don't wanna - I don't wanna -
I don't wanna - I don't wanna - I don't wanna wait in vain);
It's me love that you're running from
It's your love that I'm waiting on (I don't wanna - I don't wanna -
I don't wanna - I don't wanna - I don't wanna wait in vain);
It's me love that you're running from

You know I fuck with her
You know she fuck with me
You know she stuck with me
It's Gucci Mane she gotta be
A dime piece
Look at my time piece
A big bag of kush what she remind me
I'm on the slick-talking shit, like the Isleys
You got to spend 400,000 to ride behind me
You got to pay 15k just to sit beside me
I'm on the grind, I ain't even got to go outside before you see me shine
Real niggas want to get me fired
Cutie pie wanna come and say hi
Player haters want to see die but it can't stop me, nigga I'm alive
.45 shoot 13 times
AK's yetta don't take lies
And your main girl on my line
Nigga, I swear I ain't never seen a bitch so fine

[Hook]
She got her own cash, I fawk with that
I fawk with that, I fuck with that
She got a full swag, I fawk with that

Turnt up to the max, I fawk with that

She only fuck with street niggas, I fawk with that
I fawk with that, you know I fawk with that

[Verse 2]
The bitch I’m with she so fly she need a fucking flight attendant
If I said that shit, I meant that shit
Ten million dollars cash, I done spent that shit
If you love that chick, don’t send that bitch
Don’t lend that bitch, I hit that bitch
Break that bitch and bend that bitch
Don’t follow my rules I end this shit
Sipping on Bombay, what would your mom say?
Let’s not pretend ’cause I’m not your fiancé
Met on a Sunday, fuck on a Monday
Girl you ain’t heard I’m in love with that money
Keep it a hundred keeping you running
Turn your ass round and you lay on your stomach
Cuffin no woman, keep it from coming
Keep it I’m coming. I’m brutally honest
All in the AT, all in Atlant
Pulling her Tracs while she’s scratching my back
Leaning in forward, she pushing me back
Bad at commitment but great in the sack
Gave her a stack, baby relax
Way that she sucking, it's paying me back
Dick is a horse so I’m fucking with that
Roses are red, Ferraris are black

[Hook]

[Intro: James Fauntleroy]
What of the dollar you murdered for?
Is that the one fighting for your soul?
Or your brother's the one that you're running from?
But if you got money, fuck it, cause I want some

B-I-G
Who fucking with me?
Oh god!

[Hook: Big Sean]
Ain't nobody fucking with my
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my muthafucking
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad bitches, man, they want the...
They want the... they want the...

[Verse 1: T.I.]
It's H.U.S.T.L.E. gang
They try me, I bet we bang
Ride in the Chevy man, candy painted, day to day
Rain on these niggas, bring pain to these niggas
I'm in this bitch you know you shouldn't came pussy nigga
I'm a Pimp Squad OG
Quarter, half, whole thing
Score 24 keys, flip that, more cheese
Chya, hey, It's money that we talking about
How you want it? Cash, credit or the Swiss account?
I'm playing with a big amount
Make more than your bitches count
Say there's a hotter nigga, where?
Here? Now? Point him out
Tell when you see me now you now we run shit
We about that action training, go
Nobody do it like my muthauckin' clique

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I tell a bad bitch do whatever I say
My block behind me like I'm coming out the driveway
It's grind day, from Friday, to next Friday
I been up straight for nine days, I need a spa day
Yup, she trying get me that poo-tang
I might let my crew bang, my crew deeper than Wu Tang
I'm rolling with... fuck I'm saying? Girl, you know my crew name
You know 2 Chainz? Scrrr! I'm pulling up in that Bruce Wayne
But I'm the fucking villain, man, they kneeling when I'm walking in the building
Freaky women I be feeling from the bank accounts I'm filling
What a feeling, ah man, they gotta be
Young player from the D that's killing everything that he see for the dough

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Yeah, I'm talking Ye, yeah, I'm talking Rih
Yeah, I'm talking B, nigga, I'm talking me
Yeah, I'm talking bossy, I ain't talking Kelis
Your money too short, you can't be talking to me
Yeah, I'm talking LeBron, we ball in our family tree
G.O.O.D. Music drug-dealing cousin, ain't nothing fuckin' with we, me
Turn that 62 to 125, 125 to a 250
250 to a half a million, ain't nothin' nobody can do with me
Now who with me? ¡Vámonos! Call me Hov or Jefe
Translation: I'm the shit, least that what my neck say
Least that what my check say, lost my homie for a decade
Nigga down for like 12 years, ain't hug his son since the second grade
He never told. Who we gonna tell? We top of the totem pole
It's the Dream Team meets the Supreme Team
And all our eyes green it only means one thing
You ain't fucking with the clique

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Break records at Louis, ate breakfast at Gucci
My girl a superstar all from a home movie
Bow on our arrival - the un-American idols
What niggas did in Paris, got 'em hanging off the Eiffel
Yeah I'm talking business, we talking CIA
I'm talking George Tenet, I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach, think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented
You know white people get money, don't spend it
Or maybe they get money, buy a business
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go ign'ant
I know Spike Lee gone kill me but let me finish
Blame it on the pigment, we living no limits
Them gold Master P ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination, MTV cribs
Now I'm looking at a crib right next to where TC lives
That's Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse
He wasn't really drunk he just had a frew brews
Pass the refreshments, a cool, cool beverage
Everything I do need a news crew's presence
Speedboat swerve, homie watch out for the waves
I'm way too black to burn from sun rays
So I just meditate at the home in Pompeii
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Everytime I'm in Vegas they screaming like he's Elvis
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real, got me feeling Israelian
Like Bar Refaeli, Gisele, nah that's Brazilian
Went through, deep depression when my momma passed
Suicide, what kinda talk is that?
But I been talking to God for so long
And if you look at my life I guess he's talking back
Fucking with my clique

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Viceroy
Early in the morning
Just trying to let the sun in
And open up my eyes
Viceroy
As it's getting later
Heading for the corner
Already running dry

[Chorus]
And oh, don't let me see you crying
'Cause oh, honey, I'll smoke you 'til I'm dying

[Verse 2]
Viceroy
Don't take me for a fool now
I'm only trying to calm down
Just trying to keep it cool
Viceroy
As it's getting later
Heading for the corner
I'm leaving it to you

[Chorus]
And oh, don't let me see you crying
'Cause oh, honey, I'll smoke you 'til I'm dying

[Outro]
"There really is nothing quite like it."

[Verse 1]
Oh uh
I see fingers, hands, and shades of faces
Reaching up and not quite touching the promised land
I hear pleas, and prayers, and a desperate whisper saying:
"Oh Lord, please give us a helping hand"
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Way down in the background
I can see frustrated souls of cities burning
And all across the water vapor
I see weapons barking out the stamp of death
And up in the clouds I can imagine UFO's jumping themselves
Laughing they saying
Those people so uptight, they sure know how to make a mess

[Verse 3]
Back in the saloon my tears mix and mildew with my drink
I can't really tell my feet from the sawdust on the floor
But as far as I know
They may even try to wrap me up in cellophane and try and sell me
Brother sell me, and don't worry about looking at the storm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, what's up baby girl?
I'm just looking over this homework
I really need some help
You wanna study with me?
That'd be nice, yeah

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
I wanna go study, baby would you be my buddy?
And help me with my project, cause you are who I roll with
Honestly I know it, take me boo, you the one I wanna go with
5 days out the week, my stay's out the street
It pays to be discreet, your fragrance is sweet

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Honeydew, money do
But this ain't about no money, this about me and you making ooh
Take it from me, first day of school I'm looking cool, I got my clothes pressed
I'm a senior but I'm seeming like an old vet
Time will pass me by if I don't graduate this time so I expand my mind
Find ways, to elevate it, motivate it, calculate it, reinstate it
Look at you girl, you got me dedicated

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
I wanna go study, baby would you be my buddy?
And help me with my project, cause you are who I roll with
Honestly I know it, take me boo, you the one I wanna go with
5 days out the week, my stay's out the street
It pays to be discreet, your fragrance is sweet

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, put me on the game
Though I keep my head in these books, I'm not a lame
Usually kinda square, I'm trying new shit for a change
Telling bitches things, like if wanna get with me you gone need a lot of brains
And just cause I don't play, who say I can't ball?
My nigga Mac, dude me and him is in the same hall
So don't get mad if I relax and get my bake on
Just promise that you'll try to catch me if my grades fall

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
I wanna go study, baby would you be my buddy?
And help me with my project, cause you are who I roll with
Honestly I know it, take me boo, you the one I wanna go with
5 days out the week, my stay's out the street
It pays to be discreet, your fragrance is sweet

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Devin there you are, look at my repertoire
Spitting game, you know for reppin hard
Change that perspective, that's my objective
Cool and oh so collective, connected
Check this, I need you more that you could know
See you the seed in my weed, baby help me grow
Let it go, let me know where to meet at
Student of the week, baby I will be that, you know I need that

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
I wanna go study, baby would you be my buddy?
And help me with my project, cause you are who I roll with
Honestly I know it, take me boo, you the one I wanna go with
5 days out the week, my stay's out the street
It pays to be discreet, your fragrance is sweet

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Call you on your phone and never come see you, darling I will never do that
I'm roaming through the halls and asking people who be with you just to try to know where you at
Call you on your phone and never come see you, darling I will never do that
I'm roaming through the halls and asking people who be with you just to try to know where you at

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
I wanna go study, baby would you be my buddy?
And help me with my project, cause you are who I roll with
Honestly I know it, take me boo, you the one I wanna go with
5 days out the week, my stay's out the street
It pays to be discreet, your fragrance is sweet

[Chorus]
Come around the hood, see sittin' here lookin' good
Tell me what they mad for
You should be on the radio, soundin' like I made a million dollars
Tell me what they mad for
Tell me what they mad for
Girl tell me what they mad for
Tell me what they mad for

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
If you sellin' all the records and you fuckin' all the bitches
And you sit a top of the charts and you livin' out your wishes
With your chains all smothered and your watches all glittered
And your ghost and your phantoms all comin' home to visit
Or maybe cause your bitches was never really your bitches
With your baby mama fucking every rapper in the business
Niggas saying you was better when the drugs was in your system
Now your crack swag gone ever since you came from prison
Got you tweeting all stupid, is you skatin', is you dissin'
Found out your Ghost leased and your Phantom just rented
Won’t need it in your name like Pac when he went missing
Makaveli lives on so I’m riding on you bitches
Hail Mary be the witness, Lord Willin' I was dealing
Stupid motherfucking five star, tatted on his ceiling
Bullseye, be the motherfucking target for this killing
Ain't y'all the motherfuckers with the millions?

[Chorus]
Come around the hood, see sittin' here lookin' good
Tell me what they mad for
You should be on the radio, soundin' like I made a million dollars
Tell me what they mad for
Tell me what they mad for
Girl tell me what they mad for
Tell me what they mad for

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Is it cause I got houses on every coast
Or that I'm on that Forbes list making rich rappers look broke
While they blowing that smoke I'm blowing a couple millions
Making a killing stunting on imposters
Only rapper in the game with a grammy and a Oscar
Seven figure movie deals, eight figure bank runs
And I'm still feeding the same hood that I came from
Any car that you got I've already drove
Any chick that you hit, my nigga, I've already hoed
Say it with your chest, like these diamonds in my charm
Name on my headphones, label tatted on my arm
Air traffic control say Ludacris is insane
That nigga daugher's birthday is the tail number on his plane
Fuck with me, but nobody fucking with me
Taking a shot of my Cognac
More millions, real G's chugging with me
If I'm happy there's no reason you should be sad for
So if somebody, can somebody please

[Chorus]
Come around the hood, see sittin' here lookin' good
Tell me what they mad for
You should be on the radio, soundin' like I made a million dollars
Tell me what they mad for
Tell me what they mad for
Girl tell me what they mad for
Tell me what they mad for

He's everything that I need and
All that a man should be, and
Put me on a flight if I wanna
Buy out the mall if I wanna

And I know y'all heard before
These same old metaphors
But my love is so much more

Love that I've ever had
And I just gotta let you know this

Don't let 'em tell you nothing different (Oh no)

Don't wanna replace him with nobody else
I'ma keep holding on

My money long, my temper midget
King gold chains, I reinvented this gold shit
You a gold fish nigga
Try me 4 kings like freecell nigga
Sippin' out a cup like a toddler nigga nigga
Who the fuck want drama pain
Back at it like a chiropractor mane
That that nigga rock quarter mil in chains
Gat squirt at you like Stacy Lane
Nigga nigga sunroof your brain
Claim that you drink but you can't even hang
Only came cause a nigga got paid
Sleep with them hoes, they gon' fuck up your name
Pop the zanny I'm stressin', pop the molly I'm flexin'
Dre Beats my beats bang, biker jeans: Balmain
She suck me off till I'm all drained
Kick her out: Liu Kang
Wide body need two lanes, got a 504 bitch go to Tulane
Niggas think that I'm playing I ain't saying this shit to be slaying a nigga
Make your bed, lay in it, fucker
Born sinner, make a nigga die for his dinner
Eyes of a tiger stone killer cold blooded winner
Fucking beast, going HAM, gotta eat
Thanksgiving don't thank me
Cause that ain't beef
Yall' niggas sweet
Money leech, money laundering
Private jet, I don't fly economy

Lambo Aventador, spent half a million
Car Weezy, mixtape got no ceiling
Floss like a dentist, numb to a bitch, no feelin’
Lotta bad bitches and my niggas fully trippin’
OGs got old clips like Lord Willin’
Let the gat squeeze, like fresh lemons
Old money but I need more like Demi
Raw like Eddie, keep a sidekick Semmi
Shit bang, you going dumb
I’m going Timmy
I don’t drive no fucking Infinity
Pull up, niggas clear the vicinity
Killing your vanity
Hot like Alana be, shots, niggas scramblin’
All about my chips
Gamblin’ Mandalay Bay veteran
Bad bitch, let her in
Late night, Letterman
Allergic to broke niggas, Claritin
7-6 ball hard always stay travellin’
Referee shots got haters back peddlin’
Bald like I’m 70, stay with the weather ‘93
Gotta fly private cause my niggas got felonies
Used to do Beverly, now we shop overseas
Pop that dick, bitches fit it in their ovaries
Damn, I love it when a bitch got her ass tatted
Said she just got it done, don’t pat it
Both hands left cheeks now I’m left handed
Ass so big, can’t look at it
Can’t look at it, can’t look at it
Made me bust fast like I’m trigger happy
She like when I talk shit like Bill O’Reilly
And I give her hard wood, like a cabin
Cabin in the woods
All you niggas actin’ scary
Get my collab on, Dr. Romanelli
Shirt off, nigga feelin’ like Makaveli
Y’all my niggas goin’ HAM
We don’t need a deli
Ain’t shit you can tell me
Got ‘em pissed off, R. Kelly
Bitches tell me “sure” like Al B
All I do is win like Gwen don’t doubt me
Bitch took 22 years to get rich
Been in love twice, still screamin’
“Bitches ain’t shit”
Tryin’ ta keep my niggas out of jail
They always hittin’ licks
And I’m paid in full
Niggas call me Money Makin’ Mitch
T Real, that’s my nigga
Nitty Santana, he’ll groove a nigga
Eat quick cash like a fast food dinner
Niggas don’t remember shit
They gon’ remember me, nigga
‘Cause I’m the shit, bitch!

[Verse 1]
Looking back on when I was a little nappy-headed boy
Then my only worry was for Christmas, what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes would not get a thing
We were happy with the joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door with, "Boy, thought I told you not to go outside"
Tryin' your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whoopin' your behind

[Chorus]
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
'Cause I love them so

[Verse 2]
Brother said he's telling 'bout you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell and I'll give you anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (You nasty boy)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing ain't right
But while you were doing it, it sure felt outta sight

[Chorus]
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?

[Intro]
Come on
Me, I've been searching, for that right one
And hopefully I found her
I found her

[Verse 1]
My nigga tells me 'bout this girl that he knows, oh
Said she the type of girl that I'm looking for, oh
Shout me her number and said make sure I call, oh
Got straight to the point when she picked up the phone
When she picked up the phone she said hello and I said

[Hook]
A friend of mine said that you were the one for me
A friend of mine said that you was with everything
A friend of mine said that you are good company
A friend of mine said that you got good pussy baby
Got good pussy baby
Can I sample baby? Cause I'm curious, curious
I want it baby
Gotta have it baby
Said I need it baby cause I'm so curious, curious

[Verse 2]
Now girl I don't mean to come off so strong
But I heard that you got the love that I want
Can you promise me that it's true what they say?
Before you tell me your name? Is you with it?

[Hook]
A friend of mine said that you were the one for me
A friend of mine said that you was with everything
A friend of mine said that you are good company
A friend of mine said that you got good pussy baby
Got good pussy baby
Can I sample baby? Cause I'm curious, curious
I want it baby
Gotta have it baby
Said I need it baby cause I'm so curious, curious
{Bridge}
Tell me is you with it?
Is you with it? (4 times)
Tell me are you with it?
Are you with it? (4 more times)

[Verse 3]
Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
That coochie, that twat, that pussy stuff
Whatever you wanna call it, I can't get enough
I can be your lover, be your friend
Be your number one or your ten
Baby yell dress, and just like UPS or FedEx girl we can both send
Then pray in the morning, then after we pray more play in the morning
Have it your way like a shoe custom made whenever you need
Or maybe like a chain of Burger King's
I promise if we do it, I'll remain serene
I truly understand
Nobody gotta know like a group of yes men
So momma don't trip
And if it goes well we can make you a flip
So what it's gon' be miss lady my clock is tickin'
So please tell me you accept my proposition
Are you gonna tell me now?
Or you need more time if you do that's fine
As long as it goes down, girl make up your mind

[Intro]
Yup, yeah yeah
Oh, hahahaha
Yup yup yup yup yup yup yup yup yup
Yup yup yup yup yup yup yup yup yup
I got enough weed to last me for the rest of my motherfuckin' life
Ain't gon' ever run out

[Verse 1]
Uh, get the cork out the bottle
Get that money up and make your style a lil' harder to follow
I've been hustlin' all the time, that's the only thing I know
Now my watch is worth 30 thousand
Got Cuban links and Italian
Boy, I'm gettin' it
Ridin' in my ride, lookin' filthy rich
Killin' these niggas, I ain't innocent, my bad
Ain't paid the cost, see they just watch me, then copy my swag
Say I fell off, that's where you lost me
How's that when my name is in my upholstery?
I'm rollin' up and goin' places across seas
Hopin' the neighbor don't smell the shit I bake
And every day I'm on another plane
I hardly sleep but hey
I wouldn't have it any other way

[Hook]
Now here we are, now there we go
You holdin' on to it, we we smoke it all today
Now here we are, now there we go, now there we go
Now here we are
I wake up and I bake up, get my things and catch a plane
But I'll be back again (Now there we go), back again (Now there we go)
Now here we are
I wake up and I bake up, get my things and catch a plane
But I'll be back again (Now there we go), back again (Now there we go)

[Verse 2]
Uh, so much money that when I pull up
Hop out and walk in the bank, teller look at me funny
Know how much I get
Know I'm liable to walk up in this bitch
Like Tony with big blue bags of this shit
And tell 'em "Count it up"
Ridin' 'round in that Cali
Got OG Kush in my body
My nigga, I keep it G and that's Gucci or that Gianni
I'm gettin' dressed for the airport to pose for the paparazzi, huh?
Mo' money, mo' problems, not how I see, huh?
Mo' money, mo' Roberto Cavalli, bruh
Damn, ain't it funny how time pass
Only nigga in first class

[Hook]
Now here we are, now there we go
You rollin' on to where we smoke it all today
Now here we are, now there we go, now there we go
Now here we are
I wake up and I bake up, get my things and catch a plane

Now I done grew around some niggas that caused me some drama
Swear when you make it niggas say you owe them
Swear they think they your momma
Everybody with their hands out
They always ask me, they know that I got it
My biggest fear is going broke
Can't say no, that's my problem
I wanted that Rolls-Royce
Young boy looking to make a bad choice
Then it got fucked up when mom went to jail
I heard a little voice
Back of my head, Back of my mind
Dropped out of school but a nigga did fine
I ain't telling you to drop out, but if you do make use of your time

Taking these shots, abusing my liver
It's mine, I spend it

Doomsday, Doom's date
These niggas weak like it's a tuesday

OK I go to sleep in the mornin’, been countin’ money all night
I did it all on my own so these cars I’m gon’ buy
Them niggas hated on me, I was all the way in Dubai
Gettin’ lambo doors sky high, told that bitch, bitches know Ty

Red rum, murder gang, these niggas gay like Novacane
My niggas gutta like bowling lanes, like Pedro they go for me
Two Asian bitches, they siamese, so high a nigga look Chinese
She bite the head like Ozzy, Freddy Krueger money you only see in your dreams

H-Town, ball hard like my name Hakeem
Olajuwon, James Harden, y’all niggas new to the scene
And that’s my nigga, Super Club need a new liver
Pop-pop bottles on all these bitches, bitch ass niggas can’t even get in

Relentless, please believe me, that Justin Bieber, my nigga really
Ain’t gotta lie, these niggas feel me, my bars up, like poppin’ wheelies
They want beef cause my neck chilly, got a bad white bitch like Iggy
Iggy pop, rock star livin’, I’m a flyer nigga, shout out to Philly

I get crazy pussy, psychiatrist, all about my paper like journalist
Kill a flow, I earn this shit, we ball for real like tournaments
On the jet, no turbulence, straight flexin’, I’m so bent
No lie, no lie, said I ain’t never told no lie
Said fuck you if you hate me, my real fans gon’ ride
Got my own shoe, clothing line, own label, who tryna sign?
Niggas tryna turn up, but don’t overdose like Len Bias

Hypocrites are all biased, I’ll provide you a Jahova jireh
I could bless you, no church attire, pray to God, I’ll die tryin’

Talkin' big money, bitch, uh
That little shit you talkin' 'bout, that's lunch money
We don't even smoke that
(I got, I got, I got, I got so much)
And this shit gon' be like this for uh (I got so much)
Pretty much the rest of the time we here
(I got, I got, I got, I got so much)
My little niggas got more money than you fuck niggas man
I promise (I got so much)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Quarter million, little nigga, I was nineteen
Had my hustle down pat, I did the right thing
They don't move that fast, they act like they don't like cheese
Had a couple niggas mad like they don't like me
Is it cause I'm hella paid? I think it might be
Yeah my pockets hella straight
And I smoke so much dope I got OG in my IV
So many niggas jackin' that shit don't even surprise me
I don't even want it back, shit it's off to the good
Can't even say I didn't know you would
Make a little money, get it from the road
Bring that shit back to the hood
Anytime you see me, man I'm on the grind
Nigga wasn't workin' when you knew you should
Now you talk about me when I'm on the road
And when I ride by I'm in the newest one

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I got so much money I think I should pay for all this
They ain't down to spend how much they say cause they ain't ballin'
I got so much paper I just spend it like it's nothin'
Ain't no way they spend how much they say cause they just bluffin'
I got so much money I think I should pay for all this
They ain't down to spend how much they say cause they ain't ballin'
I got so much paper I just spend it like it's nothin'
Ain't no way they spend how much they say cause they just bluffin'
I got so much

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Big money, even larger crib
No I ain't just stuntin', that's how I'm supposed to live
I move fast paced, so I drive faster cars
Take a look outside, those are really ours
And we're really stars
We all travel safe and go really far
In that custom paint, in that suede floor
In that California, that's really hard
In that California, that's what we on
Smell that strong, you know I'm baked
Chances dog, that's what we take
How much you hate, that's what we make
Roll up one, that's what we face
Lot of y'all claim that you real, gon' show up fake
But that shit don't mean a thing
Cause I'll still be on my grind and stackin' all of this change

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I got so much money I think I should pay for all this
They ain't down to spend how much they say cause they ain't ballin'
I got so much paper I just spend it like it's nothin'
Ain't no way they spend how much they say cause they just bluffin'
I got so much money I think I should pay for all this
They ain't down to spend how much they say cause they ain't ballin'
I got so much paper I just spend it like it's nothin'
Ain't no way they spend how much they say cause they just bluffin'
I got so much

[Bridge: Berner & Wiz Khalifa]
Don't even gotta ask if I get enough cause (I got so much)
Gin in my cup, twenty-two cones I'mma stuff
Lightin' another one up (I got, I got, I got, I got so much)
Live it up, every dollar spend it up
Don't even gotta ask if I get enough cause (I got so much)
Gin in my cup, twenty two cones I'mma stuff
Lightin' another one up, cause

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I got so much money I think I should pay for all this
They ain't down to spend how much they say cause they ain't ballin'
I got so much paper I just spend it like it's nothin'
Ain't no way they spend how much they say cause they just bluffin'
I got so much money I think I should pay for all this
They ain't down to spend how much they say cause they ain't ballin'
I got so much paper I just spend it like it's nothin'
Ain't no way they spend how much they say cause they just bluffin'
I got so much

[Outro: "Magic" Bishop Don Juan]
Hey man, green is for the money, gold is for the honeys
Step up your game or step down
Whenever a problem troubles us all
If you trust in the Lord there will be a brighter tomorrow
For there's nothing too much for the great God to do
And all that he asks and expects of you
Is faith that's unshaken by tribulation and yield
Confidence and knowledge that God knows best
And trouble and sorrow, they are only a test
But without God testin' of our soul
It never could reach the ultimate goal
So keep on knowing and believing
All that God has promised you would be yours to receive
Preach, Church, tabernacle
Wiz! Wiz! That's the way
Wiz! Wiz! That's the way
Wiz! Wiz! That's the way

[Intro]
Fall asleep
Fall asleep

[Verse 1]
I got a crib so fat that
You'll get lost in that bitch
I got a car so fast that if I push one button, you won't see nothin'
I got a feelin' that if it wasn't for me it wouldn't be a lot of you niggas
Well copy this then
Spend a million, count another million before I

[Hook] x6
Fall asleep

[Verse 2]
I woke up in Hawaii today
For real, I hope don't
None, these little young niggas try me today
Uh, cause between all of these closets and all of these boxes I got
Ooo, I got so much swag
That the people at the airport don't even wanna touch my bag
Only nigga in first class

[Break]
Fall asleep
Fall asleep
Fall asleep
And I roll that weed and get baked off
Before the plane even take off, nigga I
Fall asleep
Catch me on the road gettin' money
I'm in a whole different country by the time I
Fall asleep
Fall asleep

[Verse 3]
I'm flyer than most of 'em
Some try and hate, but most love 'em
Them dollars, got most of 'em
Thanks to who supplyin' what I'm rollin' up
All this kush in my mind got me slowin' up
Don't gotta smoke, I get high enough for both of us
Get a O and blow and get another O and blow another O

[Hook] x10

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Let's play black car, Black Audemar
For the love of money, I'm a die hard
Fucking role model, tell these bitches, play your part
I blew up off one tape
I take a Dime, a movie star
Foreign cars, my language off
Old school, like Cooley High
Your bitch, she getting sodomized
My money blink like Lloyd's eyes
These niggas telling, like all lies
Said they want beef, but they french fries
I'm hot popping, nigga deep fried
These bitches sweating me, perspire
Tell Nicki, she want Chyna she'll turn you out
Had a white bitch like No Doubt
Busting nut's for four hours
I'm on the jet getting drugged out
Jordan face, her tongue out
I'm throwing money like paper routes
My flow hard like the world gout
She eat pussy, cat down
Can't see me, background
School niggas, cap gown
Click clack, smoke cloud
Lumberjack, tall niggas
Paul Bunyan, I wish you would
All my niggas like Trayvon
Ready to die for their hood
Ball hard, no fucking catch
My shit real, your figures wax
Your Rollie ain’t Rolex
Like Mankind, get socked next
We don’t fuck with P90X
Cause all my niggas they do is flex
My car made for races
Like to fuck with rednecks
I’m on some different shit
Hop out then I pull up
Motherfucking little Mikey icey like cooler
I don’t need no help
Never fucked with no tutors
Talking all that head
Throw me in your medulla
T-Raww I’m stepping out
Bail money I’m handing out
I ain’t scared of y’all niggas
Manny Pacquiao
Strip search, I pat her down
Wiz Khalifa, I’m smoking loud
Like A$AP I got a fucking problem
Fuckin’ problem, I’m a problem child
187

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, you would have thought that from seeing me going hard
That that'd motivate these motherfuckers to get on they job
But instead they hating on what I've been doing
Having conversations in my face about what I should do for 'em
What I'mma do keep rolling and dropping weed on 'em
Pack my bags look like I'm staying for weeks but be gone in the morning
If the flight is private, we probably should board it
You see it you like it, I can probably afford it
If niggas really felt some type of way about the shit I'm doing
You picked a crazy time to start letting me know
Cause jealousy and envy that's a trait for mostly bitches
Not a man so you ain't one if you letting it show
Now the money like the weed how we letting it grow
And I ain't holding on to shit I'm letting it go
Started small but now we all in them bigger game
All in a bigger plane, ballin' and getting paid

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
First the love was there
Then the paper came
Then the haters came
But we still rise above
First the love was there
Then the paper came
Then the haters came
But we still rise above

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
Yeah, my phone is dead, but I got a contact
My sharpie paint pen on my Timbo combats
You talk shit, I won't respond back
But they gon' get, and you don't want that
That nigga will forget the deal
Remember what? Get for real
My whip appeal, my crib is real
My wrist as well you know...the Richard Mille
Hip-hop grunge nigga, I make her come quicker
Then rock toe socks, yellow sponge nigga
I Tebow, for hoes that eat hoes
Emojis fo' me and my people
The hoes love me, I'm on they TiVo
I work they thighs, and they kegels
Skateboard, I love Chanel
Retweet me bitch, I'm @Pharrell

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
First the love was there
Then the paper came
Then the haters came
But we still rise above
First the love was there
Then the paper came
Then the haters came
But we still rise above

[Verse 3: Tuki Carter]
Yeah, I hustle no muscle, I'll never be muzzled
I'm a piece to a puzzle, I'm Robert Townsend
And my words gon' Hollywood Shuffle
My nigga I move moo, my motivation is moves foo'
I get up and does do, I evenly do ten things at once
Multitaskin' super fast and king of tattin' super pimpin'
House of rollin' run a business while I'm tourin' on you bitches
Doing features while watching a double feature nigga
I see you suffering from haterism, get that check
I take nothin' and make somethin'
There's no breaks when the hustle's runnin'
Ain't dealin' with fakes, ain't fuckin' with snakes
They all in my face now they got what it takes
My nigga I'm straight
So don't reach out cause I peaced out
When I reached out, there's no response
Like knockin' on an empty house
Yeah, so I keep on while you peep on
What I be on and you're behind - that's what karma's about

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
First the love was there
Then the paper came
Then the haters came
But we still rise above
First the love was there
Then the paper came
Then the haters came
But we still rise above

[Outro: Amber Rose]
Man what the fuck is wrong with these niggas
They rollin' up, let alone doin' a song with these niggas
Claimin' they ballin', to me they playin'
These niggas ain't really doin' what they sayin'
Man what the fuck is wrong with these niggas
They rollin' up, let alone doin' a song with these niggas
Claimin' they ballin', to me they playin'
These niggas ain't really doin' what they sayin'

[Hook]
Okay, I go to sleep in the morning
Been counting money all night
I did it all on my own, so
These cars I’m gon’ buy
Them niggas hated on me
I was all the way in Dubai
Gettin’ Lambo doors sky high
Told that bitch, bitches know Ty

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Redrum, murder game
These niggas gay like Novacane
My niggas gutta like bowling lanes
Like Pedro, they vote for me
Two Asian bitches, they Siamese
So high nigga look Chinese
She bite the head like Ozzy
Freddy Krueger money you only see in your dreams
H-Town, ball hard like my name Hakeem
Olajuwon, James Harden
Y’all niggas new to the scene
And that’s my nigga, supper club
Need a new liver
Pop, pop bottles on all these bitches
Bitch ass niggas can’t even get in
Ripley’s, please believe me
That Justin Bieber my neighbor really
Ain’t gotta lie, these niggas feel me
My bars up, like poppin’ wheelies
They want beef cause my neck’s chilly
Got a bad white bitch like Iggy
Iggy Pop, rockstar livin’
I’m a flyin’ nigga, shoutout to Philly
King shit, your bitch
She all up on my dick
I get crazy pussy, psychiatrist
All about my paper like journalists
Killer flow, I earned this shit
We ball for real like tournaments
On the jet no turbulence
Straight flexin,’ I’m so bent
No lie, no lie
Said I ain’t never told no lie
Say fuck you if you hate me
My real fans gon’ ride
Got my own shoe, clothing line
Own a label, who tryin' sign?
Niggas trying to turn up
But don’t overdose like Len Bias
Hypocrites and all bias
I’ll provide you like Jehova-Jireh
I can bless ya, no church attire
Pray to God I don’t die tryin’
What’s a stone to a big giant?
What’s fire if you can’t ignite it?
I’m fed up like FBI
Y’all niggas late, colored people time, nigga

[Part 1: Clique]

[Hook]
Ain’t nobody fuckin’ with my clique
Clique, clique, clique clique

Young money motherfucker we the shit

[Verse 1: Tyga]
I ball out like the San Diego Padres
TGIF, thank God it’s Friday
Smokey Friday, so high might fly away
Competition’s small so I live big like Tom Hanks
Big bang, 22, nigga don’t believe in caine
Tried everything from sellin’ weed to counterfeit
Counterclockwise, clockwise
Now we countin’ hits
Superfreak bitches made a milli off a porno flick
Good nigga, clean dick
Fuck her right she’ll call again
I ain’t got time for modelin’
Show up lookin’ how your pictures did
Bitch, no call to niggas, but we at the Ritz
Super duper fly nigga so they bug me for a flick
Get it? Flick, flick, choppers on the hip
Make a band, chop a drum clip, I’m T.I. with this
Too ill to reheal or fix son a nigga eclipse
Hotter than Middle East is, pledge allegiance
A star bitch you the realest, I’m a realist
Father, son, holy spirit
‘cause I brought the ghost with me
Let’s toast to the Rolls I driven
You could live in
She give me clit and my clique winnin’
Bank murder up in this

[Part 2: Fuckin' Problems]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
I got a fuckin’ problem
Baby on me like a toddler
Keep my phone on silent
Vibrate, make that ass shake like a violin
College girls on me while you pressed like dialing
I been everywhere you niggas ain’t
Can’t go where your bitch go, got her up late
Make my dick plank, she gon’ drink it straight
Rotate, let her friend taste
She from the DMV but I ain’t tryin’ to wait
DC, Maryland, them phones they be wirin’ them
Shout out my nigga Wale we be fly like a terrorist
Get money like inheritance
That pussy I’mma wear it out
Yeah we in the strip club
Blowin’ money, air it out
Talkin’ big shit
Let me show you what I’m talkin’ ‘bout
Stacks for the freak show
Told her bring the circus out
I ain’t gettin’ married ‘cause these hoes
They just go around
Ridin’ on the next clique soon as they up in town
Cause I’m the nigga, the nigga nigga
They hold me down if it’s drama
And if it’s drama, I got that loud
Told my girl, Jeffrey Dahmer, and eat her out
Then I follow, and then I follow, dick in her mouth
They say Tyga only got like one hit
Shit, at least a nigga got a hit
Banana make her pussy split
Pornstar, loose lips
Ain’t no room in my circle like a hula-hoop is
Bitch
Groupie ass nigga…

187
95 like that, like that
95 like that, like that
Ninety-five…

[Verse 1: Tyga]
95 stylin', straight shots, gold medallion
Put your number on this paper promise I’mma dial it
Cute college chick, daddy was a doctor
Word through the grape vine she datin’ a rapper
Entertainer, Athelete she never after
So I entertain her late night with laughter
High, ten after midnight, it’s bedtime
You could say I stole her heart
I just call it bedtime
No rush, just relax your mind
You are now listenin’ to sounds of a better rhyme
Benz and driver, mosh pit in the lobby
Girls so horny, that’s my type of party
No ties, mob shit, suits and ties
Crap table, Vegas, vampire nights
I’d marry you tonight just to say we did it right
Waking up with regrets, roll over, she be like:

[Hook]
“Why you never call me back?”
Sometimes it just be like that
Can’t promise the world
But I can promise you half of that
Sometimes it just be like that
All the rumors you heard
I ain’t got no time for that
Shit, I ain’t got no time for that
And you ain’t gotta cry, dry your eyes
We gon’ get through that
Trust, we gon’ get through that
95 like that

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Reservations, call, reserve a table
Alligator, snake skin, Purple Label
Polyester, black berretta, who do it better?
For my niggas caged up, writin’ them letters
Lower level, reportin’ live, Channel 11
No emergency, but I’m in a 9-11
Falsetto, girl scream, a rare fellow
Pull up to the scene bumpin’ only instrumentals
And you know it
Times flies when you fly in first class all the time
And you know it
No time for the games, dollar signs on my mind
And you know it
Eye for an eye and killa just tryin’ to stay alive
And you know it
Gotta learn to live or regret, I regret some times, she like:

[Hook]
“Why you never call me back?”
Sometimes it just be like that
Can’t promise the world
But I can promise you half of that
Sometimes it just be like that
All the rumors you heard
I ain’t got no time for that
Shit, I ain’t got no time for that
And you ain’t gotta cry, dry your eyes
We gon’ get through that
Trust, we gon’ get through that

95 like that
95 like that
95 like that
95 like that

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Litigations, black faces, lawyers, brief cases
Agents top notch, paid investigations
Fire Dorf Todd, block shots, Anthony Davis
Raww the greatest, acres, no neighbors
Die so many times, hope we do better next time
Think about it, dog, next time you drop a dime
Better ride, said she’d rather fly
Always asking me the same thing all the time

[Hook]
“Why you never call me back?”
Sometimes it just be like that
Can’t promise the world
But I can promise you half of that
Sometimes it just be like that
All the rumors you heard
I ain’t got no time for that
Shit, I ain’t got no time for that
And you ain’t gotta cry, dry your eyes
We gon’ get through that
Trust, we gon’ get through that
95 like that

[Verse]
You better fall back
Nigga gone with all that
I'm a big dog, got no time for small cats
And I been known most of you guys is all rap
Hiding behind rhymes, disguised in all black
I'm in the endzone moving the chains winning the game
9 of 10 clones saying my name to get in the game
Wait a minute homes, first of all let it be known
I'm bout that business homes
So all that flexing and the lyin' you can kill it homes
You just a cub I'm a lion don't forget it homes
Listen I'm out your division homes
My name's written in stone on the throne that I'm sitting on
Long term like in Great Britian homes
Spitting strong, in a zone
On the microphone I'm sickest known
Everybody's ego I be pissin' on
Getting blown riding through the city on
Big Chrome sitting under something that you thought I couldn't fit on anyway
Let's say we cut to the chase and get straight to the knitty gritty homes
The way you bitch and moan like a broad you need titties on
And I'm straight don't get me wrong
Shawty I ain't into dudes
Talk about your music not about me in your interviews
Seem like every time I'm rapping I'm offending dudes
And I ain't even thought about you let alone mention

[Outro]
MLK, DJ Drama I just want these motherfuckers to know I don't need no goddamn mix-tape homes
Nigga I got 150 songs nigga
I got 150 songs on deck my nigga
I mean like on some real shit I'll give this shit to you if you want it
If you really, all you gotta say is Tip we miss you dog
Tip we wanna hear you dog
Then I'll goddamn throw some shit out there homes
But don't goddamn come comparing me to no goddamn nigga
Who done dropped 3 mix-tapes when I done dropped 7 albums nigga
I don't wanna hear this shit nigga!
Fuck you saying! Nigga my son got better songs than you nigga!
Aye dig on some real shit next time I hear another motherfucker
Comparing my album to a motherfucking mix-tape
I'm a walk up to you my nigga
And I'm a slap you with a stack of 50s
Think its a motherfucking game!!
Fuck a Mix-tape nigga!!!

[Verse]
I'm in your room now your screaming for help
Anxiety attack so you piss on yourself
And you pray to god that one of your neighbors can help you
But that won't happen I'm helter skelter
In my lobby, they can't find me
I'm not a maniac, i'm a zombie
I'mma rap about some neo nazi
Bitch you better call on God or Gandhi
Better hope Jesus come baptize you
Because I'm about to come rape or sodomize you
Keep doing that until I realize you
Dead from the sound boom when I pound you
I'm a night stalker, catching bitches walking after dark in parks
Hit that corner, then they're gone
They can't call for help because I took their phone
Using up minutes, use them to call my homies just to tell them that I'm in it
Bitch I dare you to scream
Haven't you heard of Sarah? That's me
I made that bitch my milk tits
I was dressed up like Lisa Simpson
Put her to sleep, quick in my hilton
Now I'm bout to change your name to Ruth Wilson
Voices in my head like kill them
Amityville insanity pill
I can't swallow my cavities
They're strictly from these casualties, that's really good with ham and cheese
Load them up on Craigslist
My email address is:
How-you-doing-my-name-is-Tyler, and you're a dead bitch
(First)

[Hook]
(Aye, aye, aye, aye)
Run bitch, run!
(Howl)
(I'm a motherfuckin' wolf)

[Outro]
You better run, bitch
I see niggas rockin that gold
Check my old shit bitch
I had the gold engine
Niggas had to get the chrome

These niggas, they fuckin whack
These niggas, they fuckin whack
These niggas, they fuckin whack
Me, I spit that fuckin crack
Me, I spit that fuckin crack
T Raww, that fuckin crack
White whips, my rims black
My credit cards, all black

I’m looking over yo crib
Private jet I get
Black ghetto burr we swerve
Talking shit like an adlib
I'm Papa Bear, you bitch
Have yall trees, grab my porridge
Got accounts just for tourin'
I can move your fairly what I tour in, bitch
3000 like Andre
I spent that on my prom date
I’m getting tickets like sweepstakes
I treat beef like cheese steak
These niggas fake like old bait
Chicken niggas, that's shake n' bake
I fly out, that great escape
My pockets fat – that’s Ricky Lake
Cash spender, I throw it out
Can’t you see ? I’m totaled out
Diddy money, only bad boy around
Burger King, only time you get a crown
West side, tell them niggas bow down
Ice Cube, my niggas stay with a frown
Gold on, young Nino Brown
We ran your bitch Gangnam Style
Ah Asian nigga, kick game like Bruce Lee
T Raws in the stores, they selling out like floor seats
These bitches lost like Dorothy
Coward lions, no heartbeat
I just let my car speak, it’s gone with the wind like the hair piece
Abu Dhabi, I’m getting blowed
That shit illegal but so are hoes
I’m ouchea, like open toes
These niggas gay like rainbows
Old scores, no kango
Stack chips, that’s Pringle
I told my girl I’m single
I count numbers, that’s bingo

Hot nigga, I could start a forest fire
She get low like low tires
This killa music, that’s Michael Myers
I’m so great, like Tony Tiger
They steal my style, that’s Winona Ryder
BMX, my niggas riders
Just added a tiger to my show writer ah

These niggas, they fuckin whack
These niggas, they fuckin whack
These niggas, they fuckin whack
Me, I spit that fuckin crack
Me, I spit that fuckin crack
T hard, that fuckin crack
White whips, my rims black

[Intro]
Yeah
Who else you know smoke a half pound in seven days nigga
Drew on the boards
E on the beat
Uh, hahahahaha
I'm just doing what I usually do man
Sticking to the script no new lines

[Verse 1]
Uh, I spend a lot of nights thinking
How did I make it this far
I spend money every chance I get
Cause goddamn I work hard
Put here to take care of the family
But how was I supposed to know
If I don't take care of myself huhh
Then how am I supposed to grow
Still rollin' my 0's, and all of my fans, they all at my shows
They rollin' them pins and counting up all of them grams
We smoking 'til all of it's gone
Just bought a new crib and there's not enough space to fit all of my clothes

[Hook]
Im just riding out in my ride...
Smoking weed while I drive...
Flying like we were time...
Smoking weed while I drive...

[Verse 2]
I spend a lot of days thinking
I hope this never gets old
Then I realize I'm on vacation
Somewhere it never gets cold
Some criticize decisions that I made
But fuck was I supposed to do
Long as I'm on everything is straight
Plus all my niggas on too
So you can't tell us nothing
Not a thing no discussion
You can smell what I'm smoking
Know it's dank that I'm puffin
Kinda high when I made this
On the plane hella comfy
On my way to the money

[Hook]
I'm just riding out in my ride...
Smoking weed while I drive...
Flying like we were time...
Smoking weed while I drive...

[Outro]
Smoking weed while I drive, smoking weed while I drive
Smoking weed while I drive, smoking weed while I drive
Smoking weed while I drive, smoking weed while I drive
Smoking weed while I drive, smoking weed while I drive
Smoking weed while I drive, smoking weed while I drive
Smoking weed while I drive, smoking weed while I drive
Smoking weed while I drive, smoking weed while I drive
Smoking weed while I drive, smoking weed while I drive
Smoking weed while I drive, smoking weed while I drive
Smoking weed while I drive...

[Intro]
I'm pinned down by the dark

[Verse 1]
Been fighting with my sheets and nearly crying in my sleep
Yes, I'm battling that well-told gripe, the most frustrating type
You should have racing stripes the way you keep me in pursuit
Sharpen the heel of your boot and you press it in my chest
And you make me wheeze, then to my knees you do promote me

[Chorus]
I'm pinned down by the dark
A-N-I-M-A-L
Makes my head pirouette
More than I would be willing to confess
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S

[Verse 2]
The light it fidgets through, the thoughts'll soon revert to you
About as bashful as a tribal dance, the first and final chance
And course the audience of frighteners and fiends
Divided up into two teams
When the acrobat fell off the beam, she broke everyone's heart

[Chorus]
I'm pinned down by the dark
A-N-I-M-A-L
Makes my head pirouette
More than I would be willing to confess
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
The most unsuitable pet
It's been long enough now so let's
Make a mess, lioness

[Bridge]
I'm pinned down by the dark
I'm pinned down by the dark, oh-oh-oh

[Outro]

[Hook]
See we ain't got much in common, so we don't do that much talking
Sometimes it feels so awkward
She watch me take a shower, I asked her why she didn't join me
She said because you didn't ask me; I said, "Damn, I didn't think I had to"
Then she take off my towel, and I-I take off her blouse
I tell her that that pussy for me, just in case she thought it was ours
And she say cool

And if you like it I love it
If she like it I love it

[Verse 1]
See we ain't got much in common, so we don't do that much talking
Cause every time she try to tell me something, she open up her mouth, I stick my tongue in
She got a piercing in her vagina, a skirt with nothing under
And she say when she don't see me, she feels like Stevie Wonder

[Pre-Hook]
That's when I said, "Work, work, work
If you want that purse, skirt, shirt"
And she made me cum 100 times
She made me cum 100 times
Man, she got that work, work, work
I say you my bitch now, I'm calling you first
And then made her cum a 100 times
She kinda green but I'm color blind

[Hook]
See we ain't got much in common, so we don't do that much talking
Sometimes it feels so awkward
She watch me take a shower, I asked her why she didn't join me
She said because you didn't ask me; I said, "Damn, I didn't think I had to"
Then she take off my towel, and I-I take off her blouse
I tell her that that pussy for me, just in case she thought it was ours
And she say cool

[Bridge]
Uh, I like that shit
And she bite that lip when she like that dick
Ooh, I like that shit
And she bite that lip don't fight that dick girl, girl
Fucking with you, well, I'ma need another shower
I'ma need another shower
Can you help me take another shower?
Then we gonna make each other shout

[Verse 2]
There's steam in the air, fog everywhere
She can get her hair wet cause it's her real hair
I be like, "Hell Yeah"
And she be like, "Fucking right"
Now she got one leg in the air, I'm pulling on her hair
And she say I can pull it, cause it's her real hair
She be like, "Hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah" cause I fuck her right

[Pre-Hook]
That's when I said, "Work, work, work
If you want that purse, skirt, shirt"
And she made me cum 100 times
She made me cum 100 times
Man, she got that work, work, work
I say you my bitch now, I'm calling you first
And then made her cum a 100 times
She kinda green but I'm color blind

[Outro]
Then I said, "See we ain't got much in common
So we don't do that much talking
Sometimes it feels so awkward"

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Ok ok ok ok, now who's hot, who's not?
Shorty doo whoop, it's cool you bloodclot (cool)
You come to the spot, see if you don't get got
See if you don't get got, when the semi go cock
I'm like "Aye, what the fuck a bitch think?"
Nick, you know ain't nothing changed, but my wink
Pink on pink, everything in-sync
I write pretty lyrics, every pen pink ink
I'm representin' all my girls, niggas double up
I don't play around, I'm a have to shut her down
Run up into town, I'm a have to get the crown
I'm the Young Queens bitch, with the platinum sound
None of ya girls can steal my shine, Fendi -
Schooled me to the game, now I'm in my prime
Stay humble, stay low, stay on the grind
I don't need a light, but I stay in the lime

[Hook]
When I tell 'em that I'm cumin' I'm cumin'
Rap bitches in the game always huffin' and puffin'
Damn, Why these bitches always frontin' for nuthin'
Fuck around I'm a have these bitches runnin' from suttin'
When I tell 'em that I'm cumin' I'm cumin'
Rap bitches in the game always huffin' and puffin'
(Damn) Why these bitches always frontin' for nuthin'
Fuck around I'm a have these bitches runnin' from suttin'

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Guess what Nicki spit crack, like yayo
Yep, matter fact, when I rap, It's a K.O
Come through the hood, all the boys say "Ayo!"
Lettuce and tomato, don't forget the mayo
Words in the street, that Nicki don't play doe
Bitches pop shit, but they soft like play dough
Gotta lotta banks, so she wanna be me
I gotta full tank, little momma on E
I fly first class overseas, on this BB
Snapple in my hand and it's strawberry kiwi
I ain't even make it, and these girls wanna be me
You "Mrs. Me Too", like you always say me me
I'm who they believe in, mommy don't even
Soon as I put the keys in, I switch like seasons
Get a couple beats from my nigga Doe Beezy
Why would I go hard, when this shit is so easy

[Hook x2]

[Intro: Juicy J & Wiz Khalifa]
I'm gettin' high as fuck in this, trippy niggas
Must be some real shit though
Let's get it, hear we go
I looked in the mirror today
And seen the realest nigga I ever met in my life
Hahahahaha, uhh

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I done smoked weed where they said I can't
Got rich when they said I can't
Got high and got on the plane
And brought all my niggas when they said I can't
Went shopping places they said I can't
Bought some shit that they said I can't
Jumped on the road and did all them shows
Cause I was poppin' places they said I ain't
Went hard in places they said I can't
Promoters call and try and set up dates
Bought the car with that yellow paint
Go to parties now and they set up drinks
And it's first class, so I'm private plane
Nudie jeans with my get up mane
Rolling papers and Mary Jane
I made 11 mil' and I'm still the same

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Juicy J]
What's with all these niggas and their feelings, man?
All of this and I'm still the man
Thought of this when I was just a fan
But all this money wasn't in the plan
Now it's all about them Benjamins
Ballin' hard and you in the stands
All this money, I'm a business man
Out of all these niggas, I'm the realest man
What's with all these niggas and their feelings, mane?
All of this and I'm still the mane
Thought of this when I was just a fan
But all this money wasn't in the plan
Now it's all about them Benjamins
Ballin' hard and you in the stands
All this money, I'm a business mane
Out of all these niggas, I'm the realest mane

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Out of all these niggas, they callin' me the realest
Started underneath the floor, now my money through the ceiling
Always staying on my grind, turned nothing to a million
Used to just tryna live, now a nigga make a killin'
Gold Rollie on my arm, ten rings like a don
Cuban links in my chain, Zigzag on my charm
Champagne on ice, good weed in the jar
Everything Hermes, Chanel seats in the car
When you all know them fuck niggas start hatin'
Talkin' 'bout what they gon' do but I'm waitin'
When you getting rich, they doubt you, but shout-out my gang
And my brother Will cause I couldn't do this without you, fo' real

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Juicy J]
What's with all these niggas and their feelings, man?
All of this and I'm still the man
Thought of this when I was just a fan
But all this money wasn't in the plan
Now it's all about them Benjamins
Ballin' hard and you in the stands
All this money, I'm a business man
Out of all these niggas, I'm the realest man
What's with all these niggas and their feelings, mane?
All of this and I'm still the mane
Thought of this when I was just a fan
But all this money wasn't in the plan
Now it's all about them Benjamins
Ballin' hard and you in the stands
All this money, I'm a business mane
Out of all these niggas, I'm the realest mane

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
18 racks, I pay the dough, to send them goons straight to ya door
To show you niggas what's real, and let you meet that .44
Run your mouth, you in the trunk
Glock to your head, nowhere to run
Catch you niggas when you by yourself
We gon' hit you niggas with a hundred drums
Boat load, no babbage, good drank, I'm famished
Bank account outlandish, big real estate, sittin' on land, bitch
Niggas out there tryna test me, I put the AK where his chest be
Don't fight with hoes, don't fight with niggas
No security, bitch, so don't test me
Double cup full, I be sippin' up
Mob niggas, man, real criminals
If a nigga find you, they gon' hit ya up
With a Bin Laden chopper that'll split ya up
All these hoes be jockin' tryna get with us
They gon' swallow this nut, no spittin' up
Your niggas get murked, your niggas in jail
My team gettin' money stay filled with drugs

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Juicy J]
What's with all these niggas and their feelings, man?
All of this and I'm still the man
Thought of this when I was just a fan
But all this money wasn't in the plan
Now it's all about them Benjamins
Ballin' hard and you in the stands
All this money, I'm a business man
Out of all these niggas, I'm the realest man
What's with all these niggas and their feelings, mane?
All of this and I'm still the mane
Thought of this when I was just a fan
But all this money wasn't in the plan
Now it's all about them Benjamins
Ballin' hard and you in the stands
All this money, I'm a business mane
Out of all these niggas, I'm the realest mane

[Outro: Juicy J]
I'm the realest mane, I'm the realest mane
I'm the realest mane, I'm the realest mane
I'm the realest mane, I'm the realest mane
I'm the realest mane, I'm the realest mane
I'm the realest mane, I'm the realest mane
I'm the realest mane, I'm the realest mane
I'm the realest mane, I'm the realest mane
I'm the realest mane, I'm the realest mane

[Verse 1]
Pushing through the market square
So many mothers sighing (Sighing)
News had just come over
We had five years left to cry in (Cry in)
News guy wept and told us
Earth was really dying (Dying)
Cried so much his face was wet
Then I knew he was not lying (Lying)
I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and TVs
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat, skinny people
And all the tall, short people
And all the nobody people
And all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people

[Verse 2]
A girl my age went off her head
Hit some tiny children
If the Black hadn't have pulled her off
I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour
Drinking milkshakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Don't think you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained, so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race
The way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful
I want you to walk

[Outro]
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
Five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
Five years
Five years
Five years
Five years

Let it go, let it go homie
You know we can see through them blinds homie
And see through the truth and them lies homie
Just let it go, let it go, let it go
Oh, oh (Uh, all niggas know what the fuck it is man)
Oh, oh (Young Khalifa man, hahahahaha)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, I done stayed on top of my game, gained control of my lane
Paid so much for my frames, put these lil' niggas to shame
Ordered so many of them bottles
So many of them bottles, you'd think I'm insane
Already changed the game once
I done told you but now I'ma do it and now I'ma do it again
Tell the club owners we need more sections
I made these lil' niggas go cop they Rolexes
You get the venue, you gon' need more bouncers
And tell the weed man we gon' need more ounces
Hundred grand in a rubber band
Use to be the kid, now homie, I'm the man
Hundred grand in a rubber band
Used to be the kid, now homie, I'm the man

[Chorus: Akon]
Let it go, let it go homie
You know we can see through them blinds homie
And see through the truth and them lies homie

You know they can't see what we see homie
Difference from the real and make believe homie
So let it go, let it go, let it go

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Living my life about peace
Sharing this money and tryna get all my niggas
Up off of them streets
Used to look up to some niggas
But now it seem that it all come down to me
Make sure my family gon' eat
Grinding from up underneath
Now they just say I'm a, now they just say I'm a beast
And now all these haters looking at me pitifully
Cause I'm the shit, literally
And I be stuntin' when I ride past my old school
I say fuck the new car, I cop the old school

[Chorus: Akon]
Let it go, let it go homie
You know we can see through them blinds homie
And see through the truth and them lies homie

Let it go, let it go, let it go
So let them go, let them go, let them go
Let them know

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
This time I feel like it's now or never, ain't going nowhere
So no matter what they say, I'll be here forever
Even though some folks will make it so you can't win
Don't need to take it on the chin
Remember homie, you ain't even gotta hold it in

[Chorus: Akon]
Let it go, let it go homie
You know we can see through them blinds homie
And see through the truth and them lies homie
Just let it go, let it go, let it go

[Intro:] (x2)
I look at all the lonely people

[Hook: B.o.B.]
I look at all the lonely people
I see 'em, I see 'em, I see 'em, there they go
I look at all the lonely people
I see 'em, I see 'em, I can see 'em, there they go
I look at all the lonely people
I see 'em, I see 'em, I see 'em, there they go
I look at all the lonely people
I see 'em, I see 'em, I see 'em, there they go

[B.o.B.]
Cindy Lavinsky, went to a school
Where the kids that she did meet, did not treat her friendly
She in elementary, so when she went home
It was wrong evidently, so lonely and empty
Well, Lookin' for love in a club got her drunk
Met a thug named Bud, got her pregnant with a son
Here he come; in a sub-division there's a couple
Engaged in a fuss, one of them grabs a gun
But in the street, all alone, there's a kid
Tryin' to wipe away the tears after what his Momma did
And there it is
(All the lonely people - where do they all come from?)

[Hook: B.o.B.]

[B.o.B]
Benny Lavinsky, adopted at three
A foster home's where he's livin', his pockets are empty
So when he turns 16, he just ran away
And then he moved to the city and had a daughter named Lizzy
Well, In a mansion, in a room, on a bed
There's a girl so depressed, from the drugs and the stress
All the diamonds on her dress still can not relieve stress
That she faces from the world, why these niggas offer it
Evidence she's obsessed, but what she feels she can't express
All she want is happiness, but all she know is big success
Nothin' less
(All the lonely people - where do they all come from?)

[Hook: B.o.B.]

[Interlude: B.o.B] (x2)
I know that you've been havin' a lonely day
All you gotta do, is find a way
Maybe in your dreams you can fly away
Away, away, away

[Hook: B.o.B.]

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Baby I go, hard
So hard, sometimes it's hard to tell whether not I'm even on my job
Most of the time I'm running 'round, either that or I'm gone
Some of these people hating, but we don't see 'em at all
Cause we done made it, too far
Got something to say then fuck 'em
Ain't trying to lose out on all of this for nothing
I'm usually just balling and shit, whatever I want, I'mma get
No time to count the money that I got because all of it's getting spent
And all of my niggas grind so all of us getting rich
And most of these niggas fly but all of 'em ain't the shit
That's why you holding me down, been doing it ever since
Only one I wanna be 'round and counting up all these chips...wit'

[Chorus: Courtney Noelle]
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it
I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it
I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
And I, swear you deserve a wedding ring
Can't ever see you choosing nothing over instead of me
Won't ever leave you, you're the one I need so that's how I'm gonna treat you
Take you places where they using different language to greet you
Smile and shake when they meet you
Lot of cake but you got a lot of love from me and when I'm home, you can't get enough of me
Cause even when we both tired, you still put up with me
Ain't going nowhere for sure, feel like you stuck with me
Swear I feel lucky, I get anything I want
And if I need it then you got it, if I say it then you trust me
Don't see you much but when I do, I need your love and I'mma need it in a rush

[Chorus: Courtney Noelle]
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it
I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it
I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it

[Bridge: Courtney Noelle]
Baby I can't break your heart, make you wait no more
Anytime you need me, I'll be right there for sure
You don't even have to call me, just say my name
I'll be right there waiting for you

[Chorus: Courtney Noelle]
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it
I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it
I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it
I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it
I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it

[Verse 1]
Hold up, hold up, what you saying, babe?
I heard that your love's only a mile away
Moving slower, why am I wide awake?
All of this pain I'm tryna take away
Don't bother me, don't even bother calling
Drinking it tonight, I'm an alcoholic
Now I wanna try
Something new tonight

[Chorus]
Where the fuck is my lighter? (Oh)
I'm tired of all this shit, I want to light up (Oh)
Throw my drink in the fire (Oh)
Just let me pass out, I just wanna escape
Turn the lights off, I wanna blackout (Oh)
We are not one and the same
So where the fuck is my lighter?

[Verse 2]
I'ma take away the pain while I'm runnin' with the flame
In the night time, I'ma come alive
When I'm seein' a crazy face, but none of ‘em look the same
I'ma let go, just wanna let go
Can't hear what you're sayin', while the liquor playin'
Killin' my brain, it's suicide
My veins burnin' up, it feels like I'm gon' die
I'll take two shots, fuck it if you watchin'
Give me the bottle, I'ma down it
I'ma roll up with the Swisher

[Chorus]
Where the fuck is my lighter? (Yeah, yeah, oh)
I'm tired of all this shit, I want to light up (Yeah, oh)
Throw my drink in the fire (Oh)
Just let me pass out, I just wanna escape (Woo!)
Turn the lights off, I wanna blackout (Oh)
We are not one and the same
So where the fuck is my lighter?

[Intro]
Shouts out to all my hoods across the A gettin it in
My Eastside niggas, my Westside niggas
Big shouts to the Northside ("DJ Spinz, fuck nigga!")

[Chorus]
I could go on and on for days and days and song for song yeah
{"Let me tell you all about it"}
I could go on and on for days and days and song for song yeah
{"Let me tell you all about it"}
It's 'bout that Eastside tale, yeah I can tell you 'bout that Eastside tale
{"Let me tell you all about it"}
It's 'bout that Eastside tale, let me tell you 'bout another Eastside tale
{"Let me tell you all about it"}

[Interlude]
("M... L... K!!")
Let me say again! You'll never know that no matter what song
What the concept is or whatever, I'm tryin to keep it 100
So I may not be givin you the story but the story got the truth in it
You feel me? ("SCREAM!!")

[B.o.B]
Oh yeah, believe it, I can tell many secrets
But the mo' I talk about them that's just the mo' that you see 'em
Yup - I'm a believer, not sayin I'm religious
But I see somethin wrong with how we livin in my city
Why everybody from Decatur wanna be a sanger?
Or be an entertainer, or to be rich and famous?
You see us on TV, you sit for hours and you stare
Not sayin that we Gods, but that's what they try to make us

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
And like I said - even though I'm tryin to get to paid
I ain't fin' to do what they want me to do dawg
Realer than that I'm from Decatur
Decatur's a city that's gon' be on yo' mind soon as you think about it

[B.o.B]
Hell yeah I'm from the Eastside
Ain't sayin it just to get the streets behind me
Ain't like slum, but I know where I'm from
So I spit it for the slums and the street society
It's yo' block that I'm beatin' down
So that real shit's what I'm speakin 'bout
Now I can probably, tell you a lie
To tell the stories about people's problems
But everything that I got to say is
Contagious like toxic waste
Don't play ball but I'm Atlanta's Bravest
So if I'm fake then it's not today
Now I can sit up here and lie up in my rhyme
And tell you everything is fine but y'all ain't blind - nah~!

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Na na na na na na na
Ah aaah

[Verse 1]
I beat you to the punchline, girl I love you
Now what we what we gon' do?
I mean it really when I say I love you
Whatever he did, I will not do
Cause I hear your prayers late at night when no one's listening
Praying I stay the same

[Chorus]
I'm not your father
I won't desert you
I'm not your ex
Not trying to hurt you
I'm just a man
Tryna love you
I'm just a man
Trying to love you

[Verse 2]
Your walls are so impossible, I'm tired
As I'm climbing, they keep on multiplying
Everytime there's progress, we regress
And I'm stressed
All I wanna know, is why you can't let it go?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Cause everything you ever want
Is standing right in front of you
Everything you ever need
I make sure I put by for you
And I know you're scared
And I've had my days too
Let's just face this thing together, hey!

[Chorus]x2

[Outro]
Hey
Yeah
Give me that chance baby
I wanna love you
Said I wanna love you!
Let me love you baby
Let me love you baby
Ohh!

[Intro]
You be anything you want
Just keep going, going, gone, gone, gone
It don't stop here nigga

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Back when I was young I had dreams of getting richer
Then my homie Breeze set me down schooled me to the picture
I was with some wild niggas put me on the game
Told me if you tryin' to make your move you gotta know your lane homie
All you got your name and your word so never break it
For this life you pay a price you get a chance you gotta take it
Cause most niggas never make it they stranded where I'm from
Ain't no conversation all they understand is get a gun
I was riding in my Bonneville hoping I could make it
Out selling P’s and smoking weed avoiding police right up the street
Way back in the day before I had all of this paper
Before I had all of these diamonds, before I had all of these haters

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'
I remember when, I bought it I ain't need it or nothing
Always in a different state so now they label me a goner
I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner
Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name cause I been there
Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there
And I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it
Sayin' fuck the ones who hated, roll one up and celebrate

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Now let's get medicated
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
I'm hella faded

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Roll that weed up and smoke it
Take your bitch home and poke it
Juicy be gettin' so faded
Thank God I got a chauffeur
Only good Cali bud
Pulling hoes bad as fuck
Just like a youngin' my nigga
Juicy do all them drugs
Niggas smoking that babbage weed
I be on that light green
Pop molly in the after hours
A member of no sleep team
Get a whole pound smoke it by myself
Or maybe after Olympics with my homie Michael Phelps

[Verse 3: Chevy Woods]
You known I’m fresh up off that corner, twistin marijuana
They copy us, they clone us
Yeah we so fly we owners
Got acting like they been before
But they ain't never been at all
8 balls I was in the hall
Ain't have time to fuck with y'all
Champagne when we celebrate
Keen sense so I smell the hate
Middle finger we getting paid
It cost much but don't press that eight
That dotted line it ain't like that day
Comic book let me illustrate
Like power bang when they lift that cane
My cousin died wish I can get that day
Back like it's a vertebrae
Bring that nigga on front street
Talk about and never be about it
They don't wanna beef cause that's lunch meat
So anything you need you know that's on me
And that's OG, I swear homie

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Now let's get medicated
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
I'm hella faded

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Riding down the street the way I'm grinding is unique
My city holding on to me so niggas holding on their heat
Throwing up their side, rolling up that leaf
All we do is get high, all we want is peace
Always on the grind that's every day so police looking
I'm just rapping killing beats and tryin' to stay away from booking
Yeah my niggas dirty crooked I just had to make it known
And let me hit the studio to show they happy to be home

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'
I remember when, I bought it I ain't need it or nothing
Always in a different state so now they label me a goner
I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner
Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name cause I been there
Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there
And I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it
Sayin' fuck the ones who hated, roll one up and celebrate

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Now let's get medicated
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
I'm hella faded
Eminem:
... grab the mic and I am kickin 'em
While I'm getting wicked with the wicked shit
About to be kicking it with ridiculous skits
When I be flipping 'em
Taking mic's and ripping them
When I come equipped to grab
And I stab shit
I stab motherfuckers bad
They go back to the lab
It's like a crack to the crab
Or crack to the crack
It doesn't matter, cause I'm kicking mad data
It doesn't matter who's fatter
Cause if I had a gun, then I would add a whole to your bladder
Kicking the mad fuckin' shit and I ?
Motherfuckers are scared of
In all kind of ways when I rewind blind ...

[Verse 1]
Sitting here, all alone watching the snow fall
Looking back at the days when we threw them snow balls
I can't believe I'm putting the tree up by myself
I need you and nobody else

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm sorry if I pushed you away
'Cause I need you here and I want for you to know

[Chorus]
And I don't care, if I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas
I'm sorry if I hurt you but I know that
All I want is you this Christmas

[Verse 2]
And I never wanna do this alone
Baby, I just need you to be here
Here through the holidays, yeah (Yeah)
I just wanna know if you feel same way
Because I'm lonely, baby, want you to hold me, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm sorry if I pushed you away
I just want you to know I miss you and I want you to stay

[Chorus]
And I don't care, if I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas
I'm sorry if I hurt you but I know that
All I want is you this Christmas

[Bridge]
Wrapping gifts without you, babe's, like mid-December
And there's no cold, I can't do this on my own
I've changed my ways
Keep running back and forth again
I'm here to stay, yeah

[Chorus]
And I don't care, if I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas
I'm sorry if I hurt you but I know that
All I want is you this Christmas

[Outro]
All I want is you this Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas

Monroe, Taylor Gang's .44, four door (Door)
For dough, four more coupes then blow mo'

Your broke ass can't even use debit, whore
Versace decor from the bed to the floor
Have several seats or exit door
Pussy sweet, shoe mean
We ain't gettin' money, 'chu mean?
Whole time your pockets' tighter than a new weave
Fuck 'em, we gon' roll up like two sleeves
Taylor Gang, we down to bang
Y'all pussy weed blanks from failure range
They could never duplicate my Taylor frames
It's the Taylor ring, got a Taylor dame
For this cheese, oh snap

And I ain't never loafin', you won't catch me with bread knots
Eenie, meenie, minie fuckin' mo

[Intro]
Damn, we back in business

[Verse 1]
Uh, wakin' up the neighbors, you could hear the headboard shakin'
I leave all your body parts achin'
Speedin' up the pace while I look right into your face
You tell me that's that good shit you're tastin'
And I know you like it from the side
But tonight I'mma just unwind and let you ride and watch you take it
Cause I'm tryin' to get you so wet, I mean so wet
If there's a record for this shit then I'mma break it
It's goin' down no matter the place or time my car
I got enough space
Think anything you think you want, no prob I got enough cake
All up in it in the mornin', knowin' damn well that I had you up late
Ain't buyin' it you ain't spendin' it, you keep throwin' it back so I'm givin' it

[Hook]
You love when I get up in it
You love when I get, you love when I get
You love when I get up in it
You love when I get, you love when I get
You love when I get up in it
You love when I get, you love when I get
You love when I get up in it
You love when I get, you love when I get

[Verse 2]
Wake up when I bake up that's just somethin' that I do
Pick your favorite sex scene, that's what I'm gon' do to you
Up in my bed's where you probably belong
Givin' you all that I got 'til it's gone
Sexy as fuck you still got them heels on
Favorite position, we tryin' them all
Once I get in can't get out of my zone
Fuck you so good you won't pick up your phone
And when your girlfriends or whoever do call
You fuckin' with me so you tell 'em you gone
You don't smoke so I break it down, you roll it up
You poke it out, your face down so I hold it up
You don't give a shit that my money so big I can't fold it up
Plus I ain't tired 'til you finish, this ain't a race but I'm winnin'

[Hook]
You love when I get up in it
You love when I get, you love when I get
You love when I get up in it
You love when I get, you love when I get

[Break]
You don't even gotta name a place where we can go
Cause we already goin', goin', goin'
Don't nobody gotta ask or even got to know
Baby we already goin', goin', goin'

[Hook]
You love when I get up in it
You love when I get, you love when I get
You love when I get up in it
You love when I get, you love when I get

[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea
I'll sail the world to find you
If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see
I'll be the light to guide you

[Pre-Chorus]
We find out what we're made of
When we are called to help our friends in need

[Chorus]
You can count on me like 1, 2, 3
I'll be there
And I know when I need it
I can count on you like 4, 3, 2
And you'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are s'posed to do, oh yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
If you're tossin' and you're turnin' and you just can't fall asleep
I'll sing a song beside you
And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me
Every day, I will remind you, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
We find out what we're made of
When we are called to help our friends in need

[Chorus]
You can count on me like 1, 2, 3
I'll be there
And I know when I need it
I can count on you like 4, 3, 2
And you'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are s'posed to do, oh yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
You'll always have my shoulder when you cry
I'll never let go
Never say goodbye
You know

[Chorus]
You can count on me like 1, 2, 3
I'll be there
And I know when I need it
I can count on you like 4, 3, 2
And you'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are s'posed to do, oh yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh

[Outro]
You can count on me, 'cause I can count on you

[Hook]
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh (So is you 'bout it 'bout it?)
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh (So is you 'bout it 'bout it?)

[Verse 1]
Uh, then go crowd around it
And tell everyone that live in your whole town about it
Gon' and roll up that good weed, I put about a pound in
And get high as the mountains
I remember the days when niggas used to have some love for a g
But now they doubt it
Would've been down with me and my team, but now they outted
Put my all in my everything and what I got is
So much money I can't even motherfuckin' count it
Uh, and you can have all of this
After all the hard work you can have all of this
Money and the cars, clothes, you can have all of this
Roll up in the best clubs, you can have all the women
Homie when the checks come, you can have all of this
When you put your family on, you can have all of this
When you let the stress go, you can have all of this
You lookin' at the best, so that's why I got all of this

[Hook]
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh (So is you 'bout it 'bout it?)
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh (So is you 'bout it 'bout it?)

[Verse 2]
Uh, uh-huh, no pain
Oh, uh-huh, no gain
Who said we can't change the world?
Look how we changed the game
Uh, uh-huh, no pain
Oh, uh-huh, no gain
Who said we can't change the world?
Look how we changed the game
Look how far up we came, shit
Look how my chain done changed
Man look at they faces
Now when they look in our faces
Look when they look in our faces
They look at us and we're famous
And I don't know where my plane is
I haven't been home in ages
Got people blowin' my phone up
So many important waivers
My marijuana's the loudest
That mean my weed is the greatest
I give a fuck about a hater

[Hook]
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh (So is you 'bout it 'bout it?)
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh (So is you 'bout it 'bout it?)

[Verse 3]
Uh, how far you gotta go 'til you feel like you're already home?
And how much you gotta spend
Til you realize that you really never goin' broke
How many motherfuckers gotta tell you that you changed
Cause you got a little change
And how the fuck they gon' tell you you the best
When they told somebody else the same thing
(Come on) Cause you fly first class every day?
(Come on) Cause you roll up all that grass every day?
(Come on) Cause you spend up all that cash every day?
(Come on) Drivin' them foreign cars fast every day?
(Come on) And if you ain't, this the kind of shit you need to get on
I’m talking audemar piguet’s, leather seats to sit on
This ain't just how I feel today, this the shit I been on, I been on

[Hook 2]
People always talkin' about what they think they know
About what they think I'm doin', how I feel, and where I go
But no matter how much money I make, I'm gon' stay the same
Since I've been up at the top ain't too much changed
Cause we already on
We already on
We already on

[Verse 4]
And on and on, and on and on
Never smoked weed that was quite this strong
Never took a flight this long
Never drank champaign in Italy
Never spent a night in Rome
But it's funny cause those are the exact same things
That helped me write this song
Caught up livin' a life where tryin' to do all the right things feels wrong
So I keep rollin' and lightin' up and prayin' to God that we live long

[Break]
It's summertime, lights fade away
It's wintertime, let's make it summer
Don't look down, keep your head up
Don't look down, keep your head up
It's summertime, lights fade away
It's wintertime, let's make it summer
Don't look down, keep your head up
Don't look down, keep your head up

[Hook 2]
People always talkin' about what they think they know
About what they think I'm doin', how I feel, and where I go
But no matter how much money I make, I'm gon' stay the same
Since I've been up at the top ain't too much changed
Cause we already on
We already on
We already on

[Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant time comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

[Chorus 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And no one showed us to the land
And no one knows the wheres or whys
But something stirs and something tries
And starts to climb towards the light

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can?

[Chorus 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun

[4:56 - 19:11 - Instrumental]

[Verse 3: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Cloudless every day you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

[Chorus 3: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
You looking too good
What you standing over there by yourself for?
(Won't you come over here? Huh?)
I think it's time we take a trip, tell me where
Tell me where you wanna go (You wanna go)
I got an idea (What you think about this?)
(Just follow me baby, I'll take you where you need to be)

[Verse 1]
Girl, you know that you the shh, way you walking with them heels on
Talking to me dirty, your body I wanna feel on, feel on, feel on, feel on
Once I get to you I promise we gon' go re-real long, real long, real long, real long, real long
Girl, I do you right
Don't you know that you the shh, got me turnin' off my cell phone
Nothing's more important than getting our fairytale on, tale on
Your hair long, hair long, I just wanna pull it
Baby, wait a minute, don't be timid
Don't be shy, you so fly, I just wanna take you on a ride

[Chorus x2]
I think it's time we take a trip to the bed
Girl, your body's talking and I'm loving what she said
Don't you be afraid to let me elevate you
Welcome you to super, duper, jupiter love

[Verse 2]
Girl, you know that you the shh, ain't nobody gotta tell ya
Natural body fragrance is such a sweet aroma
Oh how I love being inside your love
You lookin' too good for me not jump all over you
So good, that's exactly what I wanna do
Let me hold your heart, show me where to start
It's amazing how you shine in the dark

[Chorus x2]
I think it's time we take a trip to the bed (Can we go there?)
Girl your body's talking and I'm loving what she said
Don't you be afraid to let me elevate you
Welcome you to super, duper, jupiter love

[Bridge]
Ooh, now that we are here, the stars are all aligned
It's unbelievable, so incredible
Give me your love
You love, welcome to super, duper, jupiter love

[Chorus x3]
I think it's time we take a trip to the bed
Girl your body's talking and I'm loving what she said
Don't you be afraid to let me elevate you
Welcome you to super, duper, jupiter love

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
Sometimes I don't get a chance to really tell you
But I promise you, my love will never fail you
Don't you get it? Right now, we're writing history
A thousand years from now, they'll talk about you and me
I know sometimes I go hard for no reason at all
Put your soul through the business and test the weight of your heart
'Cause when your back's on the wall and there's a shortage of friends
You know that I'm with you until the end

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
We got hood love, I be fussin', I be screamin' like it's over
Then I'm longin', then I'm fienin' just to hold ya
'Cause that's how we do
You know that hood love is a good love, that's me and you
How you feel, love? When I'm with you, never quit you
Now that's real love, when you ain't here, then I miss you
'Cause I still love the way that we do
You know that hood love is a good love, that's me and you

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Sometimes I think about leaving you
But when I think about what we've been through, yeah
I get a feeling like it could be the worst
'Cause I've given you my best and I don't mind it, that's fine
'Cause when you love somebody hard, then you'll love that way for life
You got all of my heart and I'll never leave your side
I gave my word to love you all the way 'til the end
So no matter what I'll be right here I'll be right here 'cause

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
We got hood love, I be fussin', I be screamin' like it's over
Then I'm longin', then I'm fienin' just to hold ya
'Cause that's how we do
You know that hood love is a good love, that's me and you
How you feel, love? When I'm with you, never quit you
Now that's real love, when you ain't here, then I miss you
'Cause I still love the way that we do
You know that hood love is a good love, that's me and you

[Verse 3: Trey Songz & Mary J Blige]
Now I play tough but not for too long
You are someone I depend on
No matter how I act at times, I could never walk away
I thought about it plenty times, but no one could take your place
Well, if there ain't no you, then there ain't no me
And if there ain't no us, then I'd rather be
By myself 'cause no one else
Can know just what I need and really understand me

[Hook: Mary J. Blige & Trey Songz]
We got hood love, I be fussin', I be screamin' like it's over
Then I'm longin', then I'm fienin' just to hold ya
'Cause that's how we do
You know that hood love is a good love, that's me and you
How you feel, love? When I'm with you, never quit you
Now that's real love, when you ain't here, then I miss you
'Cause I still love the way that we do
You know that hood love is a good love, that's me and you
Oh y'all niggas done fucked up now!
I ain't playin' wit' ya, patna
All bets is off, the truce is over, fuck the world!
I'm ready to die right here, nigga
(This shit fucked up, nigga)
This shit ain't even funny no more, patna!

[Verse 1: T.I.]
You can see me cautious 'fore you see this Carbon 15, watch it I'll squeeze, just throw it up and keep coughin'
I'mma bring it out I promise they don't see it often
100 round bullets you can take the beam off it
The powder give you power while you gettin' geeked off it
'Til you 6 feet deep dead sleepin' in a coffin
I ain't playin' with these niggas fuck 'em, let 'em keep talkin'
Bet they patnas need suits after they bodies need chalkin'
Now you the raw
Separate the realest from the soft and you the flawed
I probably wouldn't a believed it 'til I saw it
Them niggas think they flossin' tell 'em step into my office
I'm feelin' standoffish homes, you better back off it
Bust that boulder on your shoulder, I'mma blow the back off it
Drop you off the bridge in Florida feed you to the dolphins
Cop 100 bricks in Georgia drive 'em to the office
And if I bag 'em up in ounces better get a mil' off it
Trippin' off some bullshit you better chill off it
Tryin to beef and start some bullshit to get a deal off it
Niggas gon' be killed off and they mamas out here lost it
And now they mothafuckin' life it's gonna cost 'em, nigga

[Chorus]
You done done it now
Run up on him spray 100 rounds
Gun 'em down
Why these pussy niggas runnin' round?
Hunt 'em down
I want them niggas dead
I want they head I want it now
I'mma put you in the ground, nigga
You done done it now
Run up on him spray 100 rounds
Gun 'em down
Why these pussy niggas runnin' round?
Hunt 'em down
I want them niggas dead
I want they head I want it now
I'mma put you in the ground, nigga

[Verse 2: T.I.]
You bearin' witness to the latest and the greatest
You should listen to the latest 'cause them sucka niggas hatin'
Hands down best, shit, the realest ever made it
Land in a jet, Tre'mel, we done named it
Ride in Ferraris, drops, Bentleys and Mercedes
They envy the nigga's swagger
Would die for the nigga, playa
Yeah they gettin' mad but I don't wanna do favours
Nigga I'm too major
Talk to you later
Already hated you and gettin' more paper
Now how you think they take it he the best on paper
Gracin' the front pages?
Pay attention to the latest
You ain't heard the word? Better listen to the ladies
King of the whole thing, no ifs, no maybes
But the game so crazy
Niggas is so shady
Tryin' to play fair niggas think it's so crazy
That's when the arm raise and the guns gon' blazin'
Cajun, sizzlin' hot it gone crazy
Playin' hard ball you diggin' yo own grave and
If the police get you 'fore me it's O.K
We gon' have a nigga fuckin' you in the prison wit' AIDS

[Chorus]
You done done it now
Run up on him spray 100 rounds
Gun 'em down
Why these pussy niggas runnin' round?
Hunt 'em down
I want them niggas dead
I want they head I want it now
I'mma put you in the ground, nigga
You done done it now
Run up on him spray 100 rounds
Gun 'em down
Why these pussy niggas runnin' round?
Hunt 'em down
I want them niggas dead
I want they head I want it now
I'mma put you in the ground, nigga

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I'm a bullet past cuckoo
And I be wit' a bunch of dogs, no goof troop
And I'm the shit I stay away from the poop scoop
Fuck wit' me I turn you to angels like Snoop Snoop
You catch shots like the hoop do
The bullets spin you around and hula hoop you
And I don't give a damn who you
See all you hear is "Brrrap! Brrrap!" and "Su-whoop!"
Do you
Know what I do t'you
Or what I'd do to the child you grew
I'm wild, so zoo, like I'm Japanese
If niggas wanna jump they fuckin' with the trampoline
And when the block hot I come through like mezzanine
The fireman, hoe, I smell like gasoline
I got somethin' on the flo' that would blow you to smithereens
Head, arms, feet, brains, heart, liver, spleen
Bitch I'm clean
In the city where niggas be droppin' like Fonzie
Wake your ass up, bitch, nigga you not dreamin'
Pussy-ass boy die screamin'

[Chorus]
You done done it now
Run up on him spray 100 rounds
Gun 'em down
Why these pussy niggas runnin' round?
Hunt 'em down
I want them niggas dead
I want they head I want it now
I'mma put you in the ground, nigga
You done done it now
Run up on him spray 100 rounds
Gun 'em down
Why these pussy niggas runnin' round?
Hunt 'em down
I want them niggas dead
I want they head I want it now
I'mma put you in the ground, nigga
The best in men's clothing
Call Paul's Boutique, ask for Janice
The number is, ah, 718-498-1043
That's Paul's Boutique, and they're in Brooklyn
Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down
Put your head on the floor
Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down

I just met you, just the other day
Everythin’ started flowin’ my way, more an’ more
I just love you, really, I just love you for yourself
I don’t want no, no, no, no, no, no, nobody else

Hey, lay it down, let it go, fall in love
Put your head on the floor
Oh, lay it down, let it go, fall in love

One more thing, your love is a wonder to me
I just love you, really, I would really love you for free
All I want to do, all I don’t
I don’t want you to change your mind, baby
I’ll love you, baby, in your own time

Lay it down, let it go, fall in love
Lay your body
Lay it down, let it go, fall in love
Lay it down, let it go, fall in love
Lay it down, let it go, fall in love, oh yeah
I said I love, you see I love you for myself
Got everything I need, everything I need, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Baby, since I start holdin’ you hand
I never seen, I never seen such a smilin’ man, yeah

You made me happy, baby
And I almost, almost at the door
When I see you, I wanna love you more
And more and more and oh

Lay it down, let it go, fall in love
Lay it down, let it go, fall in love
Lay it down, let it go, fall in love
Lay it down, let it go, fall in love

Lay it down, let it go, fall in love
Lay it down, let it go, fall in love
Lay it down, let it go, fall in love
Lay it down, let it go, fall in love

[Verse]
I will lay me down
In a bunker underground
I won't let this happen to my children
Meet the real world coming out of your shell
With white elephants, sitting ducks
I will rise up

[Outro]
Little baby's eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little baby's eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little baby's eyes, eyes eyes

[Verse 1]
How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
I struggle to find any truth in your lies
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
My weakness I feel I must finally show

Lend me your hand and we'll conquer them all
But lend me your heart and I'll just let you fall
Lend me your eyes I can change what you see
But your soul you must keep, totally free

Har har, har har
Har har, har har

[Chorus]
Awake my soul
Awake my soul

[Verse 2]
How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
I struggle to find any truth in your lies
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
My weakness I feel I must finally show
Har har, har har
Har har, har har

[Bridge]
In these bodies we will live
In these bodies we will die
Where you invest your love
You invest your life

In these bodies we will live
In these bodies we will die
And where you invest your love
You invest your life

[Chorus]
Yeah
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
For you were made to meet your maker

Awake my soul
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
For you were made to meet your maker
You were made to meet your maker

[Verse 1]
Waves upon waves keep me down
And I can't get to the top
But when I get there I'll still be nowhere
Cause I ain't find the one I love
And if I make it out
Then we shouldn't talk about how you left me
Just how you left me

[Hook]
Drowning again, yeah
Drowning again, yeah
Drowning again, yeah
You should see how good it would be
To come drown with me

[Verse 2]
Days upon days I've been floating
And you don't care if I die or not
But when I'm deceased I hope you will be
Dying next to me in my watery grave
And before we go I just want my baby to know
How it feels to be

[Hook]

Drowning again in your love

[Skit: Father & Son]
Hey!
What?
Turn that off!
Dad, this is the best part!
Turn it off!
No!
It’s too late for this, turn it off!
Dad, this is the best part, come on!
No, turn it off now!
No, this is the, I want to listen to it, okay?
You’ve got things to do tomorrow
Yeah, right. Too late. Sure. Eat this

[Intro: Michael Jackson]
Aaow!
Aaow!

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
Hee!

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Ooh!

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell 'em I ain't second to none
And I told 'em about equality
And it's true, either you're wrong or you're right
Hoo!

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Hoo!
Gone withca girl!
Hee-hee!

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

[Rap: L.T.B.]
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson]
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
Hee-hee!

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

[Outro: Michael Jackson]
Alright, alright
Ah, dah, ah (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Dah, ah, dah, alright
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, now
Alright, alright (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Shamone, don't
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah now
Alright (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white, hoo! (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white, hoo! (Shamone, dah)

[Verse 1]
The fullest exTENT of my inTENT is to let you know what is imporTENT
My exisTENTS is miliTENT cause my conTENT bangs like it’s poTENT
DisTENT to the polluTENT, never hesiTENT, always consisTENT

Don’t try to copy this cause I paTENT
Runnin on the streets causing TENTsion
Like Running through the streets...
Runnin on the streets causing TENTsion, like "atTENTion!"

[Hook]
Hey, hey, hey, atTENTion!!!!
Hey, hey, hey, atTENTion!!!!

[Verse 2]
I got to see my life from a disTENTS
For insTENTS, my friends say I act TENTS
I’m a refugee from a yellow brick TENT
Past TENT present TENT and future TENT
Our borough is long like a senTENTS

We live with disTENT to presiTENT
Throw atTENTion about my TENT

[Hook]
Hey, hey, hey, atTENTion!!!!
Hey, hey, hey, atTENTion!!!!

[Verse 3]
Things fall on our heads like we’re NewTENT

[Hook]
Hey, hey, hey, atTENTion!!!!
Hey, hey, hey, atTENTion!!!!

[Verse 1]
You were my wife, my life, my hopes and dreams
For you to understand what this means, I shall explain
I stood all the jealousy, all the bitching too
Yes, I'd forget it all once in bed with you
Ooo darling how could we end up like this?
Oh baby let me reminisce

[Verse 2]
Oh and when we, woo, stopped the hands of time
You set my soul on fire, my one desire
Was to love you and think of you with pride
And keep you satisfied, oh baby oh baby
We could not bear the mental strain
Leave you, I never meant to
Now you see how much you hurt me
But if you ever need me, I'll be by your side
Though the many happy times we had
Can never really outweigh the bad
Oh I'll never love nobody like I loved you baby

[Verse 3]
It's time for us to say farewell, farewell my darling
Maybe we'll meet down the line
It's too late for you and me, it's too late for you and I
Much too late for you to cry
It's too late for you and me, much too late for you and I
It's too late for you and me, much too late for you to cry baby
Ah we tried, God knows we tried
Now it's too late to live and love and ah it's too late baby
It's too late for you and me, much too late for you to cry
Oh oh ohhh it's much too late
Well, all we can do is, we can both try to be happy

[Verse 1]
You showed me my tomorrow beside a box of matches
A welcome threatening stir
My hopes of being stolen might just ring true
Depends who you prefer
If it's true you're gonna run away
Tell me where, I'll meet you there

[Verse 2]
Am I snapping the excitement
If I pack away the laughter and tell you how it feels?
And does burden come to meet ya
If I've questions of the feature that rolls on your dream reel?
The day after you stole my heart
Everything I touched told me
It would be better shared with you, with you

[Bridge]
And now you're hiding in my soup
And this book reveals your face
And you're splashing in my eyelids
As the concentration continually breaks
I did request the mark you cast
Didn't heal as fast
I hear your voice in silences
Will the teasing of the fire be followed by the thud?

[Outro]
In the jostling crowd, you're not allowed to tell the truth
And the photo booth's a liar
And there's a sharpened explanation
But there's no screaming reason to inquire
I'd like to poke them in their prying eyes with things
They'd never see if it smacked them in their temples

[Intro: John Frusciante]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Waking up dead, inside of my head
Would never, never do, there is no med
No medicine to take
I've had a chance to be insane
Asylum from the falling rain
I've had a chance to break

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
It’s so bad, it’s got to be good
Mysterious girl misunderstood
Dressed like a wedding cake
Any other day and I might play
A funeral march for Bonnie Brae
Why try and run away?

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Slow cheetah, come before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah, come, it's so euphoric
No matter what they say

[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
I knew a girl, she worked in a store
She knew not what her life was for
She barely knew her name
They tried to tell her she would never be
As happy as a girl in a magazine
She bought it with her pay

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Slow cheetah, come before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah, come, it's so euphoric
No matter what they say

[Verse 4: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Everyone has so much to say
They talk, talk, talk their lives away
Don’t even hesitate
Walkin' on down to the burial ground
It’s a very old dance with a merry old sound
Looks like it's on today

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Slow cheetah, come before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah, come, it's so euphoric
No matter what they say
Slow cheetah, come before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah, come, it's so euphoric
No matter what they say

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
And I don't know where you went when you left me but
Says here in the water you must be gone by now
I can tell somehow
One hand on the trigger of a telephone
Wondering when the call comes
When you say it's alright
You got your heart right

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I'll sleep inside my coat and
Wait on your porch 'til you come back home
Oh, right
I can't find a flight
We share the sadness
Split screen sadness

[Chorus]
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight

[Verse 2]
All you need is love is a lie 'cause
We had love but we still said goodbye
Now we're tired, battered fighters
And it stings when it's nobody's fault
'Cause there's nothing to blame at the drop of your name
It's only the air you took and the breath you left

[Pre-Chorus]
So maybe I'll sleep inside my coat and
Wait on your porch 'til you come back home
Oh, right
I can't find a flight
So I check the weather wherever you are
'Cause I want to know if you can see the stars tonight
It might be my only right

[Chorus]
We share the sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
We share the sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)

[Bridge]
I called
Because
I just
Need to feel you on the line
Don't hang up this time
And I know it was me who called it over but
I still wish you'd fought me 'til your dying day
Don't let me get away

[Outro]
'Cause I can't wait to figure out what's wrong with me
So I can say this is the way that I used to be
There's no substitute for time
Or for the sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
We share the sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right, it's so right
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right, it's so right
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right, it's so right
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right, it's so right
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)

[Intro: Ab-Soul]

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Watch how I kill them with the funky rhythm
Embalming fluid fill 'em
Piranha's in 'em
Peep my persona as I
Get deep as Nostradamus
You stalling? Like the '89 I-I-Isiah Thomas
I'm ballin', cut up your pajamas if you sleepin' on me
I promise no peekin' homie you tryin' to confiscate the flow, I know
So, I switch it quicker than my bitches in mini skirts that want your attention
One thing for sure, they gon' get it
I'm cursed with the world's negatives
Probably thinkin' I'm hurt but that's the only way I can live
More money, cash, drugs, got me feeling like Ace walking inside the club
Paid in Full, MOB license plates
38's slug hugging my waist like it had arms
Then I bear it so I guess it really does
No paper work on this marriage, but I'm in love with life corruptions rather than life (woah)

[Hook]
Oh, you ain't know? I need that
More money, more drugs I need that
More murder, more guns I need that, wondering how I live with the world's negatives

This the last days my nigga
We livin' in the life where crime pays my nigga
So all I can say is get paid my nigga
Money ,murder, or dope which one you love most?

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Mamacita had a bangin' body
Drove a black beamer, present from her baby daddy probably
He knew the nigga from high school
10th grade? they was cool, fell out over a dice game
She knew that but still wanted him to penetrate through that
Shorty wait, me and your man go way back
She said so what? He don't need to know what go on between us besides, I just wanna fuck
She blew his mind
Know what? we can exchange digits
Lets hook up later pay one of them hotels a visit
She seemed more than interested, more like desperate to be intimate
Either she this polite or his lucky night
Got the champagne sittin' on ice
Room 112 fuckin' all night then interrupted by her baby daddy and some niggas that he fuck with
Got him for everything, pussy's a negative
Adam & Eve, he should've known
Oh you ain't know? you need that
More pussy, more hoes you need that
Even if it's dirty pussy you need that
Wondering how he lives with the world's negatives

This the last days my nigga
We livin' in the life where crime pays my nigga
So all I can say is get paid my nigga
Money ,murder, or dope which one you love most?
We livin' in hell waiting on heaven but you don't know so
Might as well try to accept it, go with the flow oh
This life will never change (rather than try to fix it)
So I'm gonna do my thing (Try to continue living)
Seem's like we never see home, you know?
So we screaming
This life will never change (rather than try to fix it)
So I'm gonna do my thing (Try to continue living)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Goes out to everybody that know about bad habits
And willing to accept them as a fatal attraction, what a reaction
Rolling with the punches that life gives us and end up like Ke$ha's
Liver cirrhosis, matches givin' us cancer
Bitches givin' us gono-rrhea
I promise to practice safe sex, momma, don't cry
They say the good die young but a crackhead live a long time
So I crack open a beer keg, take that bitch to the head
Sippin' it slow hopin' it prolongs my soul
And that's crazy yo
When heat is on, I put on a coat
Then take it off when it's about to get cold
I've adapted to my environment, murder environment
20 years worth of it so I gotta love it, you can't blame me
Negative energy, public pulled by evil string
As I open a bible I start to sing

[Ab-Soul]
Liquor's invaded my kidneys
Got me ready to lick off momma forgive me
I can't be held accountable that negative's be gettin me down
Got me rolling with guys, making g's
Got me tellin' lies that sound true come test me

This the last days my nigga
We livin' in the life where crime pays my nigga
So all I can say is get paid my nigga
Money ,murder, or dope which one you love most?
We livin' in hell waiting on heaven but you don't know so
Might as well try to accept it, go with the flow oh
This life will never change (rather than try to fix it)
So I'm gonna do my thing (Try to continue living)
Seem's like we never see home, you know?
So we screaming
This life will never change (rather than try to fix it)
So I'm gonna do my thing (Try to continue living)

You are my everything
You are my everything
You, my everything
Everything, everything, everything

[Verse 1]
It's all because of you, I'm never sad and blue
You've brightened up my days in your own special way
Whenever you're around, I'm never feeling down
You are my trusted friend, on you I can depend
You take me away from the pain and you bring me paradise
And when there were cloudy days you brought sunshine in my life
It never occurred to me the first time I saw your face
I would fall so deep in love that your love can't be replaced

[Chorus]
You are my everything
Love so good only you can bring
You are my everything
You are everything and everything is you

[Verse 2]
My darling only you can make my dreams come true
And every night I pray, you'll never go away
I promise I will try until the day I die
To treat you like a king cause you are my everything
You take me away from the pain and you bring me paradise
And when there were cloudy days you brought sunshine in my life
It never occurred
I would fall so deep in love that your love can't be replaced

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you

[Verse 3]
When you're lovin' me, put your lovin' arms around me
When you're lovin' me, said I feel so safe, I find security
When you're lovin' me, forever I want you to hold me
My everything, my every, every, every, everything

[Chorus] + 

[Bridge] + 

[Chorus]
You are my everything
Love so good only you can bring

And I thank you, thank you, thank you

[Intro]
I had to be the first
'Cause it was me, Rakim and Kane as a crew
Nobody knew I had styles
Know what I mean? (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
You know it's ill
It's the B-I-Z Markie
With my man Chad Muska
Guaranteed to rock, like-like this
Like-like, like like this
Rock like rock like rock rock like this, y'all

[Verse 2]
I'm the humdinger, the microphone singer
Super bell-ringer, here to bring ya
The rhyme technique-a, the ill funk freak-a
Coming right out of your speakers
Never reaching a peak-a
Perfection direction, in any section
My style is kickin' like Chinese Connection
Most Valuable Poet, thirteen years strong
The island of Long is where I belong
Superb like Goldberg, iller than Godzilla
I scared Michael Jackson into writin' a-Thriller
The ginger ale sipper, the freestyle flipper
Never see me in a pair of Grand Union brown clippers
Funk my juice capone, down when I was bony
One of the funkiest masters of ceremony
Jam, jam, jibbity jam
Let me, let me, let me tell you who I am

[Chorus]
New York, you don't stop
L.A., you can't stop
Midwest, you won't stop
(What) Hey, that bodyrock
New York, you don't stop
L.A., you can't stop
Midwest, you won't stop
(What) Hey, that bodyrock

[Verse 3]
Gotta come all night long, well like my rap
Wanna get down, I'll make your hands clap
Every time you see me I'll be doing my thing
I'm Hello Fried King with the disco flow
You know it's satisfaction guaranteed
If you're messing with me, you will bleed
Listen to me cause I'm the
Original B e-e-e-e-e I, Z, M-A-R-K
When it comes after fries, they're like this is what I'll say
I'm like super duper dopin' open
Rock the microphone, you be scopin'
Killing the most, coast-to-coast in ya
I wake up and eat cheese, eggs, and toast
Guaranteed to rock, I don't got no children
I just know that I got to go

[Chorus]
New York, you don't stop
L.A., you can't stop
Midwest, you won't stop
(What) Hey, that bodyrock
New York, you don't stop
L.A., you can't stop
Midwest, you won't stop
(What) Hey, that bodyrock

[Bridge]
I bought a lot of things
You might see me on a lot of things, because
You know a lot of people fell
You know they grab all this stuff and all that
And then gully gully
We had they chew, they chew
I mean, I had a pop hit, "Just A Friend"
But I still stay to the streets
Where a lot of people get, they try to make a
Uh, a bubblegum hit
I ain't make that be a bubblegum hit, you know what I mean?
It just happened to happen (Yeah yeah)
For the next year, you still gonna hear, gonna hear

[Outro]
New York, L.A
Midwest, what, that body rock!

[Intro: J. Cole]
Sometimes you rip straight through
(I told you how we was gon’ do it)
And sometimes you just love rappin’ this shit so much you just
(Drama I told you how we was gon’ do it)
You just like “fuck it” let me get that shit again
God, please forgive us

[Verse: J. Cole]
Yeah, blood on my sneakers, no remorse for the grievers
He played the corner like Revis, he should've had better defense
That's how I'm feelin', blood spillin' I love killin'
Niggas'll swear that they it, this is as rare as it gets
Rap game changed, this is embarrassing shit
Bunch of bitches posin' on some old Miss America shit
I was a wilder nigga, back on my therapist shit
Moving careless as shit
In a city where niggas really don't care who they hit
Who the fuck was I?
Just a young little nigga tryin' to see the other side
Of the railroad tracks, where the scarecrows at
No brains on them niggas but they'll air your back
Fuck the man, Uncle Sam, I won't sell your crack
I won't fight your wars, I won't wear your hat
I'mma pass your classes, I'mma learn your craft
I'mma fuck your daughters, I'mma burn your flag
Beware of the days when the first go last
And the last go first, damn the past sure hurt
That’s why I hit the Henny in this flask
With my foot pressed heavy on this gas
Life is like a Brillo pad
Sometimes I sit and wish I had the life that Willow had
Said I walk around mad ‘cause I never see my dad
And you wonder why my motherfuckin’ brother’s so bad
And I was in the third grade first time I skipped class
Whoa!
Switch topics, look, my bitch tropic
Stack so thick to fit need six pockets
Smash whole cliques, so sick I get nauseous
Quick as pickpockets, slick like Rick Fox’s hair
Diamond chain, yeah the Roc is here
You lean back like a rocking chair
You niggas not prepared, no preparation
This is dedication
Slit your fuckin’ throat and blame it on my medication
Illuminati meeting, showed up late and met a Mason
Who saw me and assured me that there was no better nation
For, crooks and thieves, looks deceive
They throw The Book at niggas with no books to read
See, there I go, every time I try to stunt
Can’t help but kick the real shit
Man, why I even front?
Maybe ‘cause that’s all you little niggas ever want
But I’mma change the game
See you in a couple months, boy

[Outro: DJ Drama]
Hopefully this here shows y’all somethin’
Dedication
What’s ours, and what’s yours
You see the playing field was never really that even
We just let you play the game but you dropped the ball
Cole World
Born sinner
All the way
Drama
You’re welcome
What the fuck was that?
What man? I don’t know what’s up
And what the fuck did you miss?
Get past me people, get pass me hit me
That was me that you missed
I’m the one you’ve been missing and wishing
For listen! (alright)
All commands will be coming from the goddamn top (Hit me!)
I’m the maestro (too bad)
I’m the nigga with the stick in this bitch (oh yeah)
Arranger, director, conductor
Any other fucking names you can think of (hit me)
I got drums and shit, tom-toms and shit
I got congos and bongos and guitars and keyboards and cymbals and horns all up in this bitch ..
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it
Wow, wow, kind of shit you ain't heard on the Box in a while!
Even the white people sitting up in this motherfucker can't do nothing but say wow!
Hear that Helen?
He’s tearing it up, that fella
I’d love to get my hands on those a capellas
That nigga sicker and slicker than oil on the pelican
We on the one
Me and the band jammin' like Abbott and Costello
We go together like stanky and smelly
Tummy and belly, peanut butter jelly (Hit it)
That’s some fool, there, your mommas say, "That’s my groove, there!"
Fuck the dumb shit, kill ‘em with the drum kick
Give it to the nigga with the drum stick
Hit it!
I’m flipping on the record like an acrobat
You can’t stop me cause it’s something that I’m natural at
Even in the wake of my aftermath, I catch you bitches
I’m losing my alphabet (what)
ABCD, see these bitches?
LMNO bitches
OSTR, hit it
(Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it)
You can tell I'm getting money by how they lining up
But when I’ll lead them, they’ll be whining like them Monicas
Whether they diamonds, Madonnas, designers, iguanas
Rihanna, vaginas, piranha, hit it!
I’m getting too old to be calling names
Saying bitches and hoes cause it’s all the same
On top of that the rappers always getting all the blame
But is it really cause the niggas are just off the chain (hit it)
Chicka bow chicka bow bow
Toot it up, I got something for that round brown
Black man, put your mother fucking crown on
Pull your fucking pants up, band, break it down now
Wow
Even the white people sit in this motherfucker be nothing but got doing nothing but say
Wow? Look there Judy, that goddamn band's pretty groovy
I bet you two bumps off my ass
If you play this for Mum, she'll shake her booty
Hit it
Get down the beat
Never ever ever been beat on the beat
Been more speedy than a cheetah with the rhythm I keep
Bass drum thumpin like elephant feet
Cappin on these rappers like Muhammad Ali
I’m the greatest, I’m pretty
I open line in the jungle
I send a brick to the goddamn hospital
Rumble, young man rumble!
This is totally ludicrous, it’s preposterous
You guys are fucking losers
You’re gonna piss me off
I’m gonna run through you fucking losers
They pissed me off, and we gonna knock you bums off
I'mma run through you
Prepare the beat! It's funky I'm bad (yeah) bad (yeah)
I'mma do my thing
Baby, baby, baby, baby hit me!
Say it proud! I’m black and I’m loud!
Say it proud! I’m black and I’m loud! (loud)
Say it proud! I’m black and I’m loud!
Say it proud! I’m black and I’m loud!
You gotta give homage
Soul brother number one, James Brown, ain’t nobody do it better
Hit it!
Bad man
Michael J
...
Hit it, hit it, hit it
(uh um) Mr. D Carter, from out the deep water, thank the lord for my voice, the beat and the re-carter, now pick an alphabet, and You're Z'en While im up trying to be the best MC'en. Now let me in.. I got my Key in.. And with them alphabets I never use p-e-n

You can't be sorry, you gotta be a savior, gotta be the bread winner so go rob the break maker. When they put you're homey to sleep, it gotta be a wake up, you move in the hood then you gotta meet the neighbors (thank you)

I holla bitch get off me, bitch get off me.. I'm the little ass nigga known as big homey, the killers is ballin, the niggas is targets, the snitches is talking, but this is New Orleans. I love what I got I'm just living the moment, I ain't dying just yet, I take a shit in the coffin. I Already know how to piss in the toilet, im trying to get the pot to piss in the morning. I never fall back I'd rather go forward, and when I come through you better duck like Howard. Because I got power, just like a forward, I come through the lane and straight dunk like stottle..myre.. M-I-re reminds me of I'uh, hes a Phoenix sun and I am fire, Disrespect me and I spit fire to neck and back like you are Kaya

[Hook]
"One, is the loneliest number that you'll ever do" 

[4x]

[B.o.B]
Tell me, who don't wanna be at the top of this?
The top of the game, that's obvious
I'm like Superman in Metropolis
But you can't see me through binoculars
As I fly high over the populace
Tryin to find where the hell my childhood is
I cain't even see it with my irises
The only thing that I see is the irony
Think about the past and the life I lived
All of the days and the nights I spent
In the bottomless pit called poverty
Locked in a room, don't bother me!
So if you plan on stoppin me
You need more than your vitamins
The rap game ain't a lottery
Go to school, get a scholarship
Cause you still gotta deal with the politics
How you gon' not deal with it?
That's like goin up inside of a brothel
And comin out remainin monogamous
It just don't make a lot of sense
So I just stay positive
And if you ain't where you tryin to get
Then it's a prison of the mind you in

[Hook]

[Big Kuntry]
You know who this is, mayyyyne
Big Kuntry Kainnng
Only one it's only me, who gives a fuck 'bout 2 and 3?
You suckers been played out, like them damn Ferrari jeeps
I see you niggas on the creep but y'all never next to me
Cain't see you rock climbers when I'm on my mountain peak
Why peep? Open yo' eyes - you see the cherry Mase' right?
You see the streets, rollin with me, cause my notary certified
You a hundred deep, but they be respectin me when it's only I
Green pie, back it up, tell Matty pass the mic
Know what I'm sayin I'm nasty right, my lyrics got me creamin dykes
I'm by myself when takin flight, and fuckin them girls that keep it tight
Redbox, is the movement, Tim, where's they (Home Improvement)?
While you rappers keep on tryin, I'm #1 already proven

[Hook]

[Mac Boney]
What is the numero uno?
I dip and I slide in my two-do'
Deez niggas be watchin while bitches be jockin
But Boney jack keep it so cool doe
I'm seein 'em checkin my moves out
Be careful while keepin my tool down
They know that I'm reppin that A-Town
So why do these fuck niggas play 'round?
I guess you can hate now - we straight
We got cake, we got bread, we got made clown
While you broke niggas stayed down
I stayed up on my game and my business I'm paid now
I'm never gon' lay down
We (Grand) and we (Royal) y'all niggas just stand down
For yo' homey be man down, we done ran down
Tyler bent on his ass now
I'm the head of my class now
So I'm never gon' bet for these boys that stick hands out
I prefer to keep hands down
So I know who you are when I'm throwin my fans out
Why swing on my Denzel?
I've been ridin and swervin these niggas since oh-fo'
But in one-oh, I drop one mo'
So these niggas'll know I'm the one ho!

[Hook]

[Chorus]
Southern man better keep your head
Don't forget what your good book said
Southern change gonna come at last
Now your crosses are burning fast
Southern man

[Verse 1]
I saw cotton and I saw black
Tall white mansions and little shacks
Southern man, when will you pay them back?
I heard screaming and bullwhips cracking
How long? How long? (Ah)

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Southern man better keep your head
Don't forget what your good book says
Southern change gonna come at last
Now your crosses are burning fast
Southern man

[Verse 2]
Lily Belle, your hair is golden brown
I've seen your black man coming 'round
Swear by God, I'm gonna cut him down!
I heard screaming and bullwhips cracking
How long? How long? (Ah)

[Verse 1]
Can you lie next to her
And give her your heart, your heart
As well as your body?

And can you lie next to her
And confess your love, your love
As well as your folly?

And can you kneel before the king
And say, "I'm clean, I'm clean"?

[Chorus]
But tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart?
Oh, tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart?

[Verse 2]
A white blank page and a swelling rage, rage
You did not think when you sent me to the brink, to the brink
You desired my attention
But denied my affections, my affections

[Chorus]
So tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart?
Oh, tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart?

[Outro]
Lead me to the truth and I
Will follow you with my whole life
Oh, lead me to the truth and I
Will follow you with my whole life

Har, har, har, har, har
Har, har, har...

[Hook]
On a bean, picked up my Bentley keys
Y'all stay lacking and I put her on a bean
Molly with that lean, rolling through the streets
Bitch I do my thing, bitch I do my thing
On a bean, picked up my Bentley keys
Y'all stay lacking and I put her on a bean
Molly with that lean, rolling through the streets
Molly with that lean, bitch I do my thing

[Verse 1]
Molly with that lean rolling through the streets
Man I do my thing, boy I stay clean
Boy you know I’m packing, y'all boys playing
Pull up in that Porsche, like what you really saying
Do this every day, day do this all the time, time
Man I’m on my hustle, Man I’m on my grind
In a big time, say I’m in a big league
Oh no, on the stage and you in the VIP
Oh man I’m in the streets, man I’m in your fucking girl
Take her to the crib, molly world, molly world
With that lean, with that lean, with that smoke, with the smoke
I’m on a yacht, I’m on a boat

[Hook]

[Bridge]
With that lean, lean
With that lean, molly with that lean
Molly with that lean, with that lean
With that lean, molly with that lean
Molly with that lean

[Verse 2]
On a bean, struggling out the club
Stumbling looking for my keys, keys
Hopped inside the Porsche swerving oh I'm on freeze
Rolex on my wrist, hold it up if you paid
It’s Rolex gang, gang
That's what I claim, I pull up 20 racks in my pocket
Water running with the lean like a faucet
I'm getting money and you niggas can’t stop it,can't stop it
You can’t stop it, can’t stop it
Say I’m a king, I’m a king
All the girls in the club say I’m clean, say I’m clean
I wake up in the morning do my thing,do my thing
And your girlfriend right here, she on a bean,she on a bean,she on a bean
Molly with the lean, with the lean
Molly with the lean, with the lean
Molly with the lean, molly with the lean
Molly with the lean, molly with the lean

[Verse 1]
Tuning in the latest star
From the dashboard of my car
Cruisin' at 7, push button heaven
Capturing memories from afar
In my car

[Chorus]
That's why god made the radio
So tune right in everywhere you go
He waved his hand, gave us rock'n'roll
The soundtrack of falling in love
(Fallin' in love, oh)
That's why god made the radio

[Verse 2]
Feel the music in the air
Find a song to take us there
It's paradise when I
Lift up my antenna
Receiving your signal like a prayer
Like a prayer

[Chorus]
That's why god made the radio
So tune right in everywhere you go
He waved his hand, gave us rock'n'roll
The soundtrack of falling in love
(Fallin' in love, oh)
That's why god made the radio

[Bridge]
Making this night a celebration
Spreading the love and sunshine
To a whole new generation
Whole new generation

[Chorus]
That's why god made the radio
That's why god made the radio
That's why god made the radio

[Intro]
Baby, you're looking so lovely
I'm thinking 'bout you loving me, kissing me, touching me
Looking so lovely
I'm thinking 'bout you loving me, kissing me

[Verse 1]
I promised you, I'd take you out
Enjoy your night out on the town
Light dinner and some champagne
You deserve the best of the finer thangs
Girl, tonight you couldn't look any better
Amazingly irresistable
I can see it in my mind, baby, you and I
Later on tonight, making love

[Chorus]
DJ's playing the last song
We've been dancing all night long
Wanna hold you in my arms
Girl it's time that we get gone
Can't control it any longer
'Cause the feeling's just too strong
Baby you know
It's such a beautiful thing
Way that we be doing our thang
When we be doing it
We should be making love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Most gorgeous lady in the room
I know you can feel all eyes are on you
I think they all are a little envious
Of this chemistry that we share between us
So, I don't wanna come off disrespectful
But I can't keep my hands off of you
Girl, I'm all over your love and if I can lay it down
Then right here on the ground, I'd start making love to you

[Chorus]
DJ's playing the last song
We've been dancing all night long
Wanna hold you in my arms
Girl it's time that we get gone
Can't control it any longer
'Cause the feeling's just too strong
Baby you know
It's such a beautiful thing
Way that we be doing our thang
When we be doing it
We should be making love

[Bridge]
Maybe in the car, babe
Or maybe we could stop some place
'Cause I don't wanna wait, hey
Until we get all the way home, no, no
You got me hard, gripping in the third lane
And girl it's only for the sake of your love, your love
And all I see is us
Making love 'til the sun comes up
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait
It's such a beautiful thang
Way we be doing our thang
When we be doing it
Doing it, doing it

[Chorus]
DJ's playing the last song
We've been dancing all night long
Wanna hold you in my arms
Girl it's time that we get gone
Trey can't control it any longer
'Cause the feeling's way too strong
Baby you know
It's such a beautiful thing
Way that we be doin' our thang
When we be doin it
We should be making love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I just wanna make love to you
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I just wanna make love
Oh baby, you're looking so beautiful
It's such a beautiful thang
Way we be doing our thang
When we be doing it, we should be making love
It's such a beautiful thang
Way we be doing our thang
When we be doing it
Beautiful thang in this world
It's such a beautiful thang
Way we be doing our thang
When we be doing it
Our love
It's such a beautiful thang
Way we be doing our thang
When we be doing it
We should be making love
It's such a beautiful thang
Way we be doing our thang
When we be doing it
It's such a beautiful thang

It's such a beautiful thang
Way we be doing our thang

Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah

[Verse 1]
Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

[Verse 2]
Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

[Bridge]
They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine

[Breakdown]
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you? (Ha-ha)

[Chorus]
I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

[Outro]
Myself
Can't help myself
I can't help myself

T.I
Here we go…

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green]
Just keep going, and don’t look back
And look forward from where you're at
There’s some jealousy in your rearview
Wave hello, hello, hello…
Push that pedal to the max
Count that money that’s in your lap
There’s some jealousy in your rearview
Hello, hello, hello…
Hello...
Hello...
Hello...
Wave hello, hello, hello...

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Mashing in the fast lane, envy in my rearview
Mils in my windshield, keep ‘em in a clear view
Cheers to my partners who got it, we finally did it
And here’s to the ones with potential to go and get it
We survived yesterday, foreign ride connoisseurs
Popping fly today, tomorrow ain’t promised to us
Grind hard for dirty money but our heart’s pure
Steady mobbing on these suckers, man they’re so funny to us
Broke niggas all smiles when they run into us
Get by theyself, they talking tough but don’t do nothing to us
Call themselves paper chasing, when wealth be running to us
You violate the Puppet Master, get your string pulled
Hustle Gang, King Team, label me the ring leader
Just showing haters the tail lights of my two-seaters
Two heaters with me in the ride but I don’t need ‘em though
Left evil behind me, that’s where I plan to keep it, go

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green]
Just keep going, and don’t look back
And look forward from where you're at
There’s some jealousy in your rearview
Wave hello, hello, hello...
Push that pedal to the max
Count that money that’s in your lap
There’s some jealousy in your rearview
Hello, hello, hello…
Hello...
Hello...
Hello...
Wave hello, hello, hello...

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I hustle hard, forever shine, pay haters no never mind
Won’t stop until we popping bottles at the finish line
Never been the quitting kind, spirit, ain’t no killing mine
I’m getting mine, you don’t like it, nigga, get in line
So many times I’ve shown dudes I won’t lose
Time’s precious but waste yours if you want to
Hey I made it and you didn’t, for that I ain’t to blame
Won’t change a thing, the circumstance’ll remain the same
Can’t complain, I’m highly favored, my flavor’s god given
So used to hate appreciation is a odd feeling
Still I stay focused on the millions, trying to dodge prison
Praying, asking for forgiveness, hoping God listen
As far as dissing me, pimping, go ahead and have a ball
Meanwhile I’m getting’ bread, determined to have it all
I’m talking money, sonny, if ain’t none of that involved
Why is we conversing? This vehicle ain’t reversing, go

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green]
Just keep going, and don’t look back
And look forward from where you're at
There’s some jealousy in your rearview
Wave hello, hello, hello…
Push that pedal to the max
Count that money that’s in your lap
There’s some jealousy in your rearview
Hello, hello, hello...
Hello...
Hello...
Hello...
Wave hello, hello, hello...

Hey, take a real good look at the boy
And tell me if you see just as much gangster as I feel, Y'know?
Cause that there is all I can be man
That there is just me man
W-E-E-Z-Y
WE! Hey!

[Verse 1]
Wayne deep in the grova, out comes the small soldier
Alcohol and douja, bother my composure
Oh lord, am I supposed to be this way?
Do I live no good? This may be wrong but it feel so good
Far from home, I still feel so hood
I got the set on my belly
That shit gon' be there till a nigga get buried
I ain't scary, bring it, I'm ready
I be on them Antera's to the cranberry
Handle the whip like Andretti
And I handle a bitch like my man Nelly
My nick(?) gotta go down down baby... till I uh oh, y'know!
I move a rainbow lambo on mo-mo's
As far as dough go, I'm up like no-do's
Bet I never sweats no ho
I don't get no type of threats from no foe's
I don't threat the po-po's cause I don't respect the po-po's
Many say that I possess a dope flow, and I accept
Cause when I'm being Weezy I'm at my best

[Chorus]
And even if I wanted to I can't change... I'm gangsta!
Just as sure as my name is D'wayne
I say I'm gangsta.. y'know
And even if I wanted to I can't change... I'm gangsta!
Just as sure as my name is D'wayne
I say I'm gangsta.. y'know

[Verse 2]
I ball hard like a small guard
The small boy sliding out a large toy
Me fall off? Naw boy, I'm a stand through it
The flow deserving ovation so clap your hands to it
The flow is real so A-man to it, jam to it
..been a minute since Block is Hot, this is man music
..had opinions for Block is Hot but this is grand music
..hand, blew it because the bands who damn igloo it
..and I ram the damn dick to your people's people/
Get mo' booty than Benzino's single, from bi-sexual to bi-lingual
After I sex you up it's "bye skeezer"
And I see you later baby, I'm a player
The chrome wide, fee on the five g/
I sit deep wit my heat 'case shit gets steep
Weezy a dirty south boy, I eat pig feet
I'm just me.. foreal, I'm just me

[Chorus]
And even if I wanted to I can't change... I'm gangsta!
Just as sure as my name is D'wayne
I say I'm gangsta.. y'know
And even if I wanted to I can't change... I'm gangsta!
Just as sure as my name is D'wayne
I say I'm gangsta.. y'know

[Verse 3]
And nah I'll pro'lly never kill nobody, but I've pointed my pistol
And those of you who I pointed it at, I'll still kill ya
I'm still familiar wit the hustle
I could go dope, weed or coke, bet I'll never see broke
And I know to never say never but whatever, I never felt better than now
I'm 19, I'm a veteran now
When I.. step out my house I need weaponry now
Fuck around and I bet it be bloaw, YEAH!
And they.. wondering how I get so rich as a child
Remember, I was before Romeo and Bow Wow/
Shit, I had O's way befo' Romeo or Bow Wow
But no disrespect my daughter crazy bout 'em
And.. notice how you notice nothing's fake about me
There's something great about me
And I'm still young so there's plenty more to break about me
And people brace yourselves, place yourselves in these 7 and a halves
You don't know the half, and tell me who can walk my path
Not a soul
Your boy live his life on the edge.. Geronimo
..the endge, Geronimo!/

[Chorus]
And even if I wanted to I can't change... I'm gangsta!
Just as sure as my name is D'wayne
I say I'm gangsta.. y'know
And even if I wanted to I can't change... I'm gangsta!
Just as sure as my name is D'wayne
I say I'm gangsta.. y'know
And even if I wanted to I can't change... I'm gangsta!
Just as sure as my name is D'wayne
I say I'm gangsta.. y'know

[Outro]
I can't change, I'm a gangsta!
This is me people, you can either, love me or hate me
But no matter what I'm a always be me man!
W-E-E-Z-Y, WE!
That be me
There's only one word for me
Gangsta!

[Verse 1]
You can watch TV and watch the media
President Bush doing takeover
Kate Moss in ads for mascara
All my youth the young offender
The bill payers, the drug dealers
Girls who are magazine covers
The part-time jobbers at the call center
No career plans cause you won't go far
Put away change for Ibiza and
Check your credit on your new Nokia

[Chorus]
You can be a follower but who's your leader?
Break the cycle or it will kill ya
You can be a follower but who's your leader?
Break the cycle or it will kill ya
You leader, you lead, uh, do what you do
What really good's gonna happen to you?
You leader, you lead, uh, do what you do
What really good's gonna happen to you?

[Verse 2]
Your prime minister to your employer
Ego lovers need more power
Trendsetters make things better
Don't sell out to be product pushers
The gyro casher and baby makers
Try something new cause it ain't over
All poor people from all over
Lottery's got a rollover

[Chorus]
You can be a follower but who's your leader?
Break the cycle or it will kill ya
You can be a follower but who's your leader?
Break the cycle or it will kill ya

[Verse 3]
Cherokee Indian, Iraqi and Indians
Girls and me girls when they come to the fellas and
Japanese, Moroccan, Caribbean, African
That's your life but who the fuck's your president?
You don't get my life cause I don't have a side and I
Spread dat boy 'im a mile wide and I
Got brown skin, I'm a west Londoner
Educated, but a refugee, still
You wanna war, you're old, you go
You wanna fight, you suck, you blow

[Interlude]
N-n-n-n-nah, n-n-nah, n-nah, n-nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, n-nah, n-nah
Ay! Ay!

[Verse 1]
I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart, oh

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Interlude]
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
But I know

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Interlude]
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
I'll fix these broken things, repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright (It's alright, it's alright)
My pressure on your hips, sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you 'cause I know that's what you want me to do

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before
This love has taken its toll on me (Oh, yeah, yeah)
She said goodbye too many times before (Yeah)
And her heart is breaking in front of me (Yeah)
I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me

[Verse 1]
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time

[Chorus]
And I never (Never)
Saw you coming
And I’ll never (Never)
Be the same

[Verse 2]
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don’t let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

[Chorus]
And I never (Never)
Saw you coming
And I’ll never (Never)
Be the same

[Bridge]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You’re my Achilles heel
This is the golden age
Of something good and right and real

[Chorus]
And I never (Never)
Saw you coming
And I’ll never
Be the same

[Chorus]
And I never (Never)
Saw you coming
And I’ll never (So you were never a saint)
(And I've loved in shades of wrong)
Be the same (We learn to live with the pain)
(Mosaic broken hearts)
(But this love is brave and wild)

[Outro]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
Kingston, hey, face drop, oh

Cause you always try to fill me with doubt
Sayin' that I look better if I was thinner
Don't you know you shoulda love me for my inner
When I left you, yo, I came out a winner oh oh oh oh

And I love it when I see your

Face drop, I told you not to leave me alone
And now that I got my own
I see your face drop
I told you not to count me out
Cause you always try to fill me with doubt
Sayin' that I look better if I was thinner
Don't you know you shoulda love me for my inner

And now I see your face drop

Cause you always try to fill me with doubt
Sayin' that I look better if I was thinner
(Thank you beautiful)
Don't you know you shoulda love me for my inner
When I left you, yo, I came out a winner

[Verse 1: John Martin]
There was a time I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home, I was a king, I had a golden throne
Those days are gone, now the memory's on the wall
I hear the songs from the places where I was born

[Pre-Chorus: John Martin]
Up on the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said

[Chorus: John Martin]
Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah

[Verse 2: John Martin]
There was a time, I met a girl of a different kind
We ruled the world, I thought I'll never lose her out of sight
We were so young, I think of her now and then
I still hear the songs reminding me of a friend

[Pre-Chorus: John Martin]
Up on the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said

[Chorus: John Martin]
Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah

[Hook]
I like your timbs, jewels and your gym shoes
Always with your crew, so the drama ensues
You win, you lose nothing to improve
You on the pedestal, coupe with no roof
I know that you want it, but you’re scurred

[Bridge: Mario (?)]
Said I really like it when you come around
Feelings I can’t show cause I gotta hold it down
I don’t mean to be blowing you off
I just gotta make sure when I step I ain’t wrong
You be fine as hell, and I don’t wanna play myself
So I act like I really don’t care
If you only knew what was really true
Is that I only wanna be with you

[Hook]
I like your timbs, jewels and your gym shoes

J. Cole

[Verse 1]
Got a young chick from the hood, south side
Pops never let her outside
Nigga knew the type of shit she was up against
Little did he know the shit was going to back fire
‘Cause she act quiet, got baptized, sang in the choir
But the thing she desired was a
Older nigga show her how to be a freak
The young girl is in heat, it’s deep
She sneaking out, off the leash
On the streets at night when the freaks is out
Butterfly tat on her back that she tried to hide
Until her father found her secret out
Now he flipping out, he kicked her out
She living on her own and it’s vicious out
Years go by now I got her in my room
And I’m thinking of the best way to kick her out

[Hook]
‘Cause all she ever talks about is Louie, Louie
All she ever talks about is Louis Vuitton
And nigga, I can’t fuck with her no more
I mean Louie, Louie, all she ever talk about is Louie, Louie
All she ever talk about is Louis Vuitton
And nigga, I can’t fuck with her no more

[Verse 2]
I told the bitch somebody stole my Rollie
She talking ‘bout “me too”

She talking ‘bout “me too”
LA on my next flight, you guess right, she said “me too”
Now everybody gonna Ms. Me Too
Goddamn, be you
And if that is you, you so shallow
You on a boat that won’t travel
Won’t float and won’t paddle
If I go broke it won’t matter
This stupid ass shit don’t make me
I been poor, won’t break me
You so caught up on material shit
We both know that you can’t even get

[Hook]
I mean my window down

[Verse 3]
Dude got a rich bitch, though
She off the chain, ready to go
Baddest thing, head to toe
Fine line between a rock star and just a ho
But she walked that
Goddamn, girl, she walked that
Big money talk real loud
I mean I can barely talk back
But I, but I got good game, good game
Nothing like them lames you used to
I know the rules gon’ use you
I just want the same shit that you do
Can you keep a secret?
Sometimes, man, your beeper leak it
Nigga told me she evil
I danced with the devil then, please believe it
Please believe it

[Hook]

Pour me out another phone (do-doo-ah)
I'll ring and see if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome
Can lend us a book, we can read up alone

[Pre-Chorus]
And try to get it on like once before,
When people stared in Jagger's eyes and scored
Like the video films we saw

[Chorus]
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday

[Verse 2]
Jung the foreman prayed at work (do-doo-ah)
That neither hands nor limbs would burst
It's hard enough to keep formation
Amid this fall out saturation (do-doo-ah)
Cursing at the Astronette (do-doo-ah)
Who stands in steel by his cabinet
He's crashing out with Sylvian
The bureau Supply for ageing men

[Pre-Chorus]
With snorting head he gazes to the shore
Where once had raged the sea that raged no more
Like the video films we saw

[Chorus]
His name was always Buddy (do-doo-ah)
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
And she'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid (do-doo-ah)
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him (do-doo-ah)
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers (do-doo-ah)
It's a drive-in Saturday, yeah

[Chorus]
His name was always Buddy (do-doo-ah)
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
And she'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid (do-doo-ah)
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him (do-doo-ah)
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers (do-doo-ah)
It's a drive in Saturday, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Drive-in Saturday
It's a drive-in Saturday
It's a drive-in Saturday (drive, drive-in Saturday)
It's a drive-in Saturday (it's a, it's a, it's a drive-in Saturday)
It's a drive-in Saturday (it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a)
(It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a)
It's a drive-in Saturday
It's a drive-in Saturday
It's a drive-in Saturday
It's a drive-in Saturday

We can get down like there's no one around

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
I said excuse me little mama if I may
Take this thought and send it your way
And if you don't like that then send it right back
But I just gotta say
I wanna be on you, on you
I wanna be on you, on you
And if you don't like that, then send it right back
But I just gotta say, I just gotta say

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Sh-sh-shawty with no limits, that's what I need all the time
I'm w-w-with it, she with it, she not sure she put it down
Come g-g-get it, the business, I h-h-hit it, whose is it?
The Benz with the windows tinted, go on, lock it, dirty south
Shown in like them grown men, Goose, Patron, gin
L-let me go on in, sexy moanin', c-catch me jonesin'
N-no not never ever witnessed little mama off schedule
Got me achy, call me papi, hot as saki, fly as feathers
B-but robbed that, sh-shawty house staked, g-got that prowl cat
I wanna pop it like ecstasy, pretty face and all that
But what I look for, this gal is hood core, b-baddest outdoors
Deserve a encore, the definition of a show

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
I said excuse me little mama if I may
Take this thought and send it your way
And if you don't like that then send it right back
But I just gotta say
I wanna be on you, on you
I wanna be on you, on you
And if you don't like that, then send it right back
But I just gotta say, I just gotta say

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Hey, I'm feeling you girl, wanna get close to you, no doubt
My s-s-swagger should tell it more than anything can vouch
Little mama you are what's happening, ghetto fine, I'll make you proud
So stunt-alicious, I love it, let's at least work something out
Miss Thang, million dollar game, Coke bottle frame
Make my wall of fame, let me know your name, I control the rain
I can make it better, matter of fact I'll make it wetter
Stormy weather with this cheddar all because you hot as ever
If you may lady, let me play baby, make my way baby
You won't like it, send it back, i-it's okay, baby
You's a keeper, such a diva, give me your fever
If I could freak ya, give me the word, I mean no harm

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
I said excuse me little mama if I may
Take this thought and send it your way
And if you don't like that then send it right back
But I just gotta say
I wanna be on you, on you
I wanna be on you, on you
And if you don't like that, then send it right back
But I just gotta say, I just gotta say

[Bridge: Ne-Yo]
Girl, let me touch you like nobody can
Girl, let me show you I'm a gentleman
I wanna be the one to hold your hand
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
Girl, let me touch you like nobody can
I wanna show you I'm a gentleman
Girl, let me be the one to hold your hand
I just wanna be, I just wanna be

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
I said excuse me little mama if I may
Take this thought and send it your way
And if you don't like that then send it right back
But I just gotta say
I wanna be on you, on you
I wanna be on you, on you
And if you don't like that, then send it right back
But I just gotta say, I just gotta say
I said excuse me little mama if I may
Take this thought and send it your way
And if you don't like that then send it right back
But I just gotta say
I wanna be on you, I wanna be on you
And if you don't like that then send it right back
But I just gotta say, I just gotta say
Be on you, y-y-you

[Hook: T.I.]
Smoking weed, riding chrome
Only thing I've ever known
Is walk on the wildside
Welcome to our lives
Slangin' keys, spraying K's
Every day we getting paid
To walk on the wildside
Welcome to our lives

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Come take a little walk with me through my neighborhood and come spend a day in my trap
Get your paper right and that yay some good but just keep a tool in your lap
My lil patna holding that work, nigga want weight then keep around back
Better not violate on my turf, nigga you's in danger to die like that
Ain't no investigation, no statements and no witnesses, we ain't seen shit
Pull up after dark with that jewelry on to come see a bitch, that way he get it
We on dark road with no street lights, that pistol play after fist fights
And them geek monsters walk all night with they crack pipes tryna get right
Midnight we shoot dice, the whole house smelling like cooked crack
You beat me, and you talk shit, you get shot bitch, and I took that
Hoodrats on deck, that loud is all I blow
This shit to you might sound wild, but this life is all I know

[Hook: T.I.]
Smoking weed, riding chrome
Only thing I've ever known
Is walk on the wildside
Welcome to our lives
Slangin' keys, spraying K's
Every day we getting paid
To walk on the wildside
Welcome to our lives

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Can you picture me back in '93 bumpin' Dr. Dre while I hit some weed?
Cut school, made ten G; thirteen, trying to get keys
At fifteen, I was full-grown, get wrong, get bust on
My uncle gave me a bunch of work and that shit was gone by the next morning
Young wild nigga runnin' with me, homicide wasn't nothing to us
Dead body wasn't nothin' to see, that pistol play was just fun to us
I was 19 with two felonies, one of my best friend had a life sentence
How my uncle Fred was just like me and had a bunch of partners no longer living
All about that cocaine dealing, no education, no pot to piss in
Old school, on chrome wheel, window tinted, pistol hidden
That's the shit that I come from; in my heart, fear ain't none
Stand tall, I can't run from that wildside, that I walk on

[Hook: T.I.]
Smoking weed, riding chrome
Only thing I've ever known
Is walk on the wildside
Welcome to our lives
Slangin' keys, spraying K's
Every day we getting paid
To walk on the wildside
Welcome to our lives

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, yeah
All I ever did was put on, all my old friends tryna get on
Shorty fell out, making diss songs, never talk down when I get home
Ain't the type of nigga you can shit on; hundred spokes, brick, chrome
God body, big bone, that's hard body, Jim Jones
Niggas know the sound of how we switch on him, finna wild out on a Tip song
Better make a toast, nigga, Tip home, first get the bread, then get going
From the land of the lead where they spit chrome where most kids never get to live long
Get their pistols, get pissed on, pistol-whipped and stripped, homie
Left for a minute and they switched on me, caught them talking down, tryna bitch on me
And they snitch on me, ain't got shit on me so my guess is death is what they wish on me
So I'm blowing on them candles, closed lids and dark eyes
Cause hate's never part time when you on that wildside

[Hook: T.I.]
Smoking weed, riding chrome
Only thing I've ever known
Is walk on the wildside
Welcome to our lives
Slangin' keys, spraying K's
Every day we getting paid
To walk on the wildside
Welcome to our lives

[Verse 1]
I thought I'd probably die in prison, expensive taste in women
Ain't had no pot to piss in, now my kitchen full of dishes
Nose bloody from that sniffin', your heroin addiction
Trigger finger itching, fuck parental supervision
This be that murder business, little Timmy got that semi
I ain't kidding, hide your kittens, hit your childrens with that Smith and
A bunch of ignant little niglets, hardheaded, never listen
Purp-purple sippin', finger twistin', teeth glisten like it's Memphis
A bunch of hypocritic Christians (Uh)
The land of no religion (Uh)
My Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas
Motherfuck a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition
For my Benjis and my Bentley
And them bitches now I gets-gets
On the road to riches, a diamond ring, designer jeans
Choking on that biscuit 'til I'm no longer existing
I wonder if they miss me, as long as I make history
Now my soul is feeling empty, tell the reaper come and get me

[Chorus]
Who said you can't live forever lied
Of course, I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live long
You can't ever deny my force
I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live

[Verse 2]
Riding through your city like that motherfucker mine
Or toting on that semi, rob a motherfucker blind
License plate says wipe me down, car from 1989
But a nigga sits so pretty call that motherfucker fine
Lost your motherfucking mind, what's on your mind?
Niggas talking down
Never talk to cops
Make him talk to God when I tote that 9, he ain't talking now
Tell 'em watch your spine, I mean watch your back
Better guide your track, better not look back
Now stay in line, don't step on cracks
So you break her back, I'm talking 'bout your mom (Uh)
Cause there's killers in my town (Uh)
Making hits, sniffing lines (Yeah)
Out committing crimes (Yeah)
Wait for shit to simmer down (Uh)
Corrupted little minds (Yeah)
8 and 9, finna shine (Yeah)
On the grind
Do you dirty with that shimmy shimmy ya (Uh)
Where they shoot without a purpose
Services 'n hearses
Kids who ain't deserve it
Can't survive a thing, you're worthless
Strangers make me nervous
Who's that peekin' in my window with a pistol to my curtains?

[Chorus]
Who said you can't live forever lied
Of course, I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live long
You can't ever deny my force
I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live

[Bridge]
Pretty nigga rich, Flacko be the shit
And that bitch know we poppin' so she poppin' on this dick
Nigga, RIP to Pimp, can't forget Little Flip
And I take it out to Memphis so shout out to Triple Six

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & KUČKA]
Who said you can't live forever lied
Of course, I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live long
You can't ever deny my force
I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live

[Verse 1]
Well, she got her daddy's car
And she cruised through the hamburger stand, now
Seems she forgot all about the library
Like she told her old man, now
And with the radio blasting
Goes cruising just as fast as she can now

[Chorus]
And she'll have fun, fun, fun till her daddy takes the T-bird away
(Fun, fun, fun, 'till her daddy takes the T-bird away)

[Verse 2]
Well, the girls can't stand her
'Cause she walks, looks and drives like an Ace, now
(You walk like an ace now, you walk like an ace)
She makes the Indy 500 look like a Roman chariot race, now
(You look like an ace now, you look like an ace)
A lot of guys try to catch her
But she leads them on a wild goose chase, now

[Chorus]
And she'll have fun, fun, fun till her daddy takes the T-bird away
(Fun, fun, fun, 'till her daddy takes the T-bird away)

[Verse 3]
Well, you knew all along
That your dad was getting wise to you, now
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)
And since he took your set of keys
You've been thinking that your fun is all through, now
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)
But you can come along with me
'Cause we've got a lot of things to do, now
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)

[Chorus]
And we'll have fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away
(Fun, fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away)
And we'll have fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away
(Fun, fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away)

[Outro]
Wooo-ooo-Aaaah!
(Fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away)
(Fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away)
Wooo-ooo-Aaaah!
(Fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away)
(Fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away)
Wooo-ooo-Aaaah!
(Fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away)
(Fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away)

[Verse 1]
Baby, I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time
And maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you pulled me out of time
You hung me on a line
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you

[Bridge]
Baby, I'm a man, maybe I'm a lonely man
Who's in the middle of something
That he doesn't really understand
Baby, I'm a man, and maybe you're the only woman
Who could ever help me
Baby, won't you help me to understand?
Ooh-ah

[Bridge]
Baby, I'm a man, and maybe I'm a lonely man
Who's in the middle of something
That he doesn't really understand
Baby, I'm a man, and maybe you're the only woman
Who could ever help me
Baby, won't you help me to understand?
Ooh-ah

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you're with me all the time
And maybe I'm afraid of the way I leave you
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you help me sing my song
You right me when I'm wrong
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Hey-ey-hey!
Oh, oh
Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh

[Intro]
I come apart baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checkin' trouble sugar, moving down the line
I come apart baby, but that's ok cuz
Trouble man, don't get in my way

[Verse 1]
I'm just a hood nigga I ain't never had shit
Just a bad attitude and a bad bitch
Duffle bag full of tools and a half brick
30, 40, 50 grand in the mattress
Living on the edge just a habit dawg
I'm fucked up in the head I don't have it all
Ball like a dog push it to the limit
'Bout my business tryna keep from letting pussy niggas in it
My priorities is follow, God first then the fam'
Then the hustle, then the money, failure ain't in the plan
Satan on my heel he don't want me to advance
I tell him go to hell sucka catch me if you can
Shit I am who I am, fresh up out of apologies
Sometimes I ain't get in trouble, trouble got in me
Guess it follows me but I stays on my hustle man
Still the motherfuckin' man you can call me (Trouble Man)

[Hook x2]
Trouble man, always in trouble man
Grand hustle man, I'm the motherfuckin' man
Trouble Man, stays in some trouble man
Bank rolls, rubber band, you can call me (Trouble Man)

[Verse 2]
Drugs and rock 'n' roll, ho you know how I roll
Just left the crossroads, my soul, unsold
Refrigerated console, the curtains on my car door
Raw ho, caviar, sushi and escargot
Everywhere I go fresh to death and clean as a bar of soap
Getting blowed like trumpets in the wind in Chicago
God knows I'm hot as El Diablo
Wrist rockier than Colorado walk road
Also my flows I'm taking back although
My art's so Leonardo Da Vinci, Picasso
The rain gone come down on your head like tarp holes
I guess these other rappers that's cool as far as soft goes
Sorry Charlie party's over shawty shop closed
King home, bank roll on King Kong
Got these suckas in my scope with the beam on
Prayin' for my downfall you can dream on
Make sure I'm back in the Maybach gettin my lean on
Trouble ain't changed me, role model ain't me
Don't be angry now if I'm on the same street
Make a u-turn haven't you learned I'm, Trouble Man

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Weight on my shoulders, chose to squat with it
Real niggas say I kick it the same way Pac did it
Tell all them sucka nigga what the bizz is
Upset cuz they can't do they thang like he did here
Shit, another year another bid done
No chump change big bank millions
Ya, my money old but I'm still young
Them nigga lookin' for some drama I'm a give 'em some
No more beef a pimp will say goodbye to red meat
But cross a nigga path and you're dead meat
Remain on my gang time, after time
'97 college basshead, 99 dime
'98 have provisions on 285 flyin
Skip where you meet KP and L.A Reid got signed
Cut to the present and the rap game mine
Some things never change it remains I'm (Trouble Man)

[Hook x2]

[Verse 1]
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it

[Verse 2]
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction

[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

[Bridge]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

[Chorus]
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I

[Bridge]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

[Outro]
This slope is treacherous
I-I-I like it

[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing ‘round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well

[Verse 4]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hey, have you ever loved somebody so much you can’t stand it but can’t do without 'em?
Do anything for 'em cause you truly do adore 'em
Like dedicate songs, write poems
But they be on that bullshit and you try to ignore 'em
But you feel like they feel like you ain’t right for 'em
Therefore your heart’s torn
Between bein' with 'em forever, leavin' 'em never
But it seem like you arguin', fightin' over whatever
Maybe we can leave, find someone better
Even though you know you’ve never known none better
My heart say "nah, she can’t leave, won't let her"
Been head over heels since the very day I met her
Fell so deep in love I ain’t been able to get up
Sometimes I want some peace of mind and she won’t shut up
Love her to death, don’t know whether to kiss her or kill her

[Chorus: P!nk]
Should’ve known it
From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
And we'd pray but
Even love couldn’t save us
We'd wake up
On a bed of guns and roses
And we don’t know which one to choose
When either way, we’re gonna lose
Still we'd pray but
Even love couldn’t save us
We'd wake up
On a bed of guns and roses

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I guess I’d rather suffer with her than be miserable without her
I buy a lot of Prada, Gucci and Balenciaga
To keep her content, and keep down the nonsense
But every corner we turn around's a conflict
Mostly dumb shit, like who she run with
Where the fuck you been? Your pants – they don’t fit
Really, honestly speaking, some things I don’t get
No matter how much she try she can’t make it make more sense
Therefore, here we go again
Screamin', yellin' at the top of our lungs, she goin' in
Saying the kind of shit I be like "if you was a man
I would go in your shit, for real, no shit"
But I love her so much that I can’t forget
That the feel of a kiss, it could heal when I’m sick
Still, I don’t like to feel like this
If I didn’t miss her, I would try to get her killed right quick

[Chorus: P!nk]
Should’ve known it
From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
And we'd pray but
Even love couldn’t save us
We'd wake up
On a bed of guns and roses
And we don’t know which one to choose
When either way, we’re gonna lose
Still we'd pray but
Even love couldn’t save us
We'd wake up
On a bed of guns and roses

[Bridge: P!nk]
Every time we say our goodbyes
A little piece of my heart breaks off inside
I don’t really ever know why
If I could live without you I’d try

[Chorus: P!nk]
Should’ve known it
From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
And we'd pray but
Even love couldn’t save us
We'd wake up
On a bed of guns and roses
And we don’t know which one to choose
When either way, we’re gonna lose
Still we'd pray but
Even love couldn’t save us
We'd wake up
On a bed of guns and roses

[Verse 1]
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, uh-uh, uh-uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
22, 22

[Verse 2]
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids, uh-uh, uh-uh
(Who's Taylor Swift, anyway? Ew)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh

[Chorus]
(Hey!)
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright (Ooh) if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if (Alright)
We just keep dancing like we're 22 (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
22 (I don't know about you)
22, 22

[Bridge]
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
Ooh, ooh, yeah

[Chorus]
(Hey!)
I don't know about you (I don't know about you), but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if (Ooh) you keep me next to you
You don't know about me (You don't know about me), but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
22 (Whoa, oh)
22 (Dancing like)
22 (Yeah, yeah), 22, (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

[Verse 1]
I bet this time of night, you’re still up
I bet you’re tired from a long hard week
I bet you’re sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city, and I bet
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me

[Chorus]
And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t, I almost do, I almost do

[Verse 2]
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
‘Cause each time you reach out, there’s no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can’t say hello to you and risk another goodbye

[Chorus]
And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t, I almost do, I almost do

[Bridge]
Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It’s probably better off this way
And I confess, babe
In my dreams, you’re touching my face
And asking me if I want to try again with you
And I almost do

[Chorus]
And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t, I almost do, I almost do

[Outro]
I bet this time of night, you’re still up
I bet you’re tired from a long hard week
I bet you’re sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city, and I hope
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me

[Verse 1]
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, "Okay, let's talk"
And I said

[Chorus]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

[Verse 2]
Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to

[Chorus]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

[Bridge]
You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you, all the time
All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you, for my whole life

[Breakdown]
Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!

[Chorus]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!

[Outro]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
(Ha-ha-ha, it's so fun)

[Verse 1: Gary]
Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

[Chorus: Both]
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye (Eye, eye)

[Verse 2: Taylor]
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
And right before your eyes
I'm aching, run fast
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me

[Chorus: Both]
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye (Eye, eye)

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Taylor, Gary & Both]
This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
This is the last time I say it's been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho

[Chorus: Both]
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

[Post-Chorus: Taylor & Gary]
This is the last time I'm asking you this (This is the last time I'm asking you this)
Put my name at the top of your list (Put my name at the top of your list)
This is the last time I'm asking you why (This is the last time I'm asking you why)
You break my heart in the blink of an eye (You break my heart)

[Outro: Both]
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this

[Verse]
You know they say Nicki spit crazy
Get it poppin' like M-80’s or twin tre-eighties
Young Money First Lady, ya know, baby girl of the group
I'm also known as baby girl in the coupe
Never get me confused with baby girl in the hoop
‘Cause Nicki stay fly like that Cash Money dude
I'm stuntin' on these hoes like Marilyn Monroe
I got a S-curl flow, I spit slick, ya know?
And I don't just spit raps, and chit-chat
Nicki could get it in, Nicki could spit gats
Ya girl got hustle, Nicki could pitch crack
But Nicki rather chill and stack a mil'
While these hoes stay in hoods like rats for real
My voice stay on tha track like a Mac for real
Riding the baseline like 'Quille O'Neal
Gassed ya baby father for the keys to the Escalade
Not a baby momma but I'm drama like Kay Slate
What can I say? That's how ya girl do
Ya girl stay fresh down to the cuticles
My people smoke dutches, we don't fluck with bamboo
I'm a winner mami, ya career's a gamble
Old ass broad, off track, like bad weaves
Nicki stay on her toes, on point, like ballerines
Lemme remind you, I'm gettin' a tan, too
Ya caramel dream, ya girl from Queens
They say I'm too pretty to be spittin' sixteens
I should be on the screen, posin' for Maybelline
Or be a Baby Phat girl, kitten on my jean
Hood star broad, Black Barbie Doll
Pardon me if the cockiness botherin' y'all
I'm just bein' Nicki Minaj, ya know?
Girl from around way, without the L Cool J
Ma' you spit Kool-Aid, I spit acid out
Doin' this since you was Reebok, Classic Doubt
Now this ho wanna get at Nic', why?
‘Cause I bagged her baby daddy, she ain't seen him since
Nic' so gutter, lil' white tee and some Air Max on
Some Dolce and Gabbana, pretty panties on
Like, wait 'til the summer, catch me up in the hummer
On my way to 555 front, run with the Rucker
And every baller wanna, never give out my number
Only the email, Cherry-thong.com, holla
Name a girl as real as her
Nope, not them! Who's your best MCs?
Nic, Fox, and Kim, can't forget Rem'
Nic' up in the Porsche Box or the Benz

[Verse 1]
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

[Chorus]
And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Verse 2]
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, "I need you"
And for the first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

[Chorus]
'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Bridge]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you

[Chorus]
It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Outro]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you

[Intro]
Yo, in case you ain't know
I go by the name of Akon, and I'm from (Africa, Africa)
Home of the Goree Island
I'm from Senegal, Westside (Africa, Africa)
So I'ma share with you and where I'm from
And how I was comin' up in (Africa, Africa)

[Verse 1]
So what you know about the struggles
That my people went through so you can live the way you live now?
Say what you know about
Seeing that brand new mother giving away her newborn child?
Say what you know about
Mr. Amadou Diallo, a Senegalese cops shot down?
Said what you know about how people love to perceive us
When we come into a brand new town?
Now what you know about Goree Island
Where all the slaves were shipped from?
What you know about
Being born in America to avoid immigration?

[Hook]
Still from the ghettos of Senegal (Africa, Africa)
Comin' from the ghettos of Senegal (Africa, Africa)
Comin' from the ghettos of Senegal (Africa, Africa)
Yes, I'm comin' from the ghettos of Senegal (Africa, Africa)

[Verse 2]
So what you know about
Thiéboudieune, yassa, thiéré and maafé, my favorite foods?
So what you know about niggas throwin' rocks
Bustin' shots at the military invadin' my hood?
So what you know about kids with automatic machines
Waiting for the war to get on that side?
So what you know about how God comes first in our lives?
Everything that we do is for Allah
So what you know about
That Holy place called Touba where Prophets were born?
So what you know about
Comin here, gettin money, investing it back home?

[Hook]
Right in the ghettos of Senegal (Africa, Africa)
Give it to the ghettos of Senegal (Africa, Africa!)
Take it to the ghettos of Senegal (Africa! Africa!)
Send it right to the ghettos of Senegal (Africa! Africa!)

[Outro]
Now see that's just a little piece of how it is (Africa, Africa)
See but we can come together
And make it 'lot better back home (Africa, Africa)
So don't complain about how they treating you here
Take your millions of dollars there, back to (Africa, Africa)
We own that land, we own those diamonds
**** our lives if we want to (Africa, Africa)
We kings man, we don't take orders, we give 'em
Think about it

[Verse 1]
Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

[Chorus]
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

[Verse 2]
In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons, and darling, they all look like me

[Chorus]
'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

[Bridge]
Distance, timing
Breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it
Could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up
And for the life of us we can't get back

[Breakdown]
A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic
Beautiful, tragic, beautiful

[Chorus]
What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

[Verse 1]
New to town with a made-up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

[Chorus 1]
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Now, it’s big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn’t even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you’re lucky, but you’re so confused
'Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you’ll make it out alive

[Chorus 1]
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now

[Pre-Chorus 3]
‘Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right

[Chorus 2]
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I said, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

[Verse 1]
I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up, late one night at the window
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

[Chorus]
And I said, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

[Verse 2]
He said, “Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way"
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

[Chorus]
Like, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh-ooh, dancing with me
Ooh-ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh, my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

[Breakdown]
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams

[Outro]
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?

[Verse 1]
If you ain't got two kids by 21
You're probably gonna die alone
At least that's what tradition told you
And it don't matter if you don't believe
Come Sunday morning you best be
There in the front row, like you're s'posed to

[Pre-Chorus]
Same hurt in every heart
Same trailer, different park

[Chorus]
Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down
Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round

[Verse 2]
We think the first time's good enough
So we hold on to high school love
Say we won't end up like our parents
Tiny little boxes in a row
Ain't what you want it's what you know
Just happy in the shoes you're wearin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Same checks we're always cashin'
To buy a little more distraction

[Chorus]
'Cause Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down
Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round

[Altered Chorus]
Mary Mary quite contrary
We're so bored until we're buried
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
Merry go 'round

[Outro]
Jack and Jill went up the hill
Jack burned out on booze and pills
And Mary had a little lamb
Mary just don't give a damn no more

[Intro: T.I.]
Nigga that's what I thought, I thought
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Yeah pussy nigga that's what I thought, I thought

[Hook: T.I.]

Nigga walk up to a bitch, nigga tell 'em you a bitch
Aye you flaw (you flaw) and you soft (you soft)

Aye, aye you flaw (you flaw) and you soft (you soft)
Yeah pussy nigga that's what I thought

[Verse 1 T.I.]
I'm from Bankhead, Ain't scared of na nigga
And nigga tried me, I will ride, respect, the highly cuz I ran wit a
Crew of loose screws, leaders of the new school
We can handle this however you choose, really
Gotta itchin, bust a move, nigga jump
Take us for a game, think I'm playing if you want, get stomped
And I ain't bullshittin' witchu, I don't play around
I tell 'em you a bitch nigga all the way around
Like it or not, Damn how you feel about it
I was often swangin' on the nigga talkin' the loudest
Smallest in the crowd, but I'm bout it, I bet
I stretch these cowards out tryin' my sect

[Hook]

[Verse 2 Killer Mike]
Killer Killer from the villa, Westside go-rilla
Go realer than these country-ass monkey-ass niggas
These funky-ass niggas, asswipe how I treat 'em
Fuck nigga how I greet 'em, first I beat 'em to they feeter
Might shoot 'em, might leak 'em, funerals I might preach 'em
Right befo' I six feet 'em - you already know the story bruh
Call the coroner, this sucker dead meat
I ain't never scared pussy nigga, I just dead beef
Eat it like Angus, 50 caliber, knock a plug out your anus
If I aim higher leave yo' monkey-ass brainless
Front page constitution, damn I make a fuck nigga famous
Fuck nigga famous!
Now the call the governor, the mayor and the chief of the police
Tell 'em homicide is high ridin, I'm back on they street
Then, call the traffic gangstas and the suckers talkin lip
Tell 'em bang bang bang if a nigga speak on TIP

[Hook]

[Verse 3 Mac Boney]
Yeah that's what I thought, and that's what I was thinkin
You know Boney be on point, especially when I'm drinkin
I play a nigga smooth to the left side, pimpin off of Westside
And I don't take light to all the square types, I'm 'bout mine
Stomp a nigga good like I'm tryna make some red wine
Be all on yo' ass like a canine, rewind
I start to bring the fists out, then I brought the pistols out
Runnin through the spot, you done brought the brown niggas out
The brains, I spill 'em out, leave a nigga wit his stomach out
I won't allow, a hater to get raw I will air him out
Think about, every single thing that you care about
Staring down the barrel of my bad news carrier
The more the merrier, a group of suckers watch me tear 'em up
The boss say hurry up, while I go crank the McClaren up
You haters scared of us, cause we known to make a cherry bust
You not prepared for us, we done came into yo' area

[Hook]

[Verse 4 T.I.]

Aye, I was the nigga with the tool out, right in front the schoolhouse
Then the bigger nigga fail assassin, what it do now?
Catch him let him have it, nigga best be glad I cooled down
A fool wit it, hit a nigga hood, make him move out
Yeah, nigga know it ain't no hoein' us
Try Thursday night and Friday shit just go to blowin up
Better catch a cut on that box Chevy go to showin up
Sho' 'nuff we at your do' and on ya ass soon as it open up
Nigga twice as old as us, knew we was 'bout that action too
Up and down the avenue, walkin wit a attitude
Try whoever ready for whatever, it don't matter dude
Best be on your P's and Q's cause never know what Cap'll do
He cap a nigga on the news, he a fool wit it
Nowadays it's different, I don't understand how dude kick it
Computer gooning, makin threats over the internet
Talkin 'bout what you gon' do and you ain't did it yet!

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Usher]
I was all alone
I was feeling rather low
I needed someone to lift my spirits up
So I dropped in on a dance
Just to take a glance
And there this lovely thing was
She was more than enough

I asked her for her hand
Said, "would you like to dance?"
So pleased that I had asked
She quickly took my hand
And we danced and fell in love
On a slow jam, oohh

[Chorus: Usher]
Play another slow jam
This time, make it sweet
On a slow jam
For my baby, for me
Play another slow jam
This time, make it sweet
On a slow jam
For my baby and for me

[Verse 2: Monica]
Seems what you say is true
I feel the same way, too
You see, I waited all night long
Just to dance with you
And when you touched my hand
I knew you were the man
To turn my world around
And make my dreams come true

The magic in your eyes
Made me realize
That everything I feel
Has got to be real
And we danced and fell in love
On a slow jam

[Chorus: Monica]
Play another slow jam
This time, make it sweet
On a slow jam
For me and for my baby
Play another slow jam
This time, make it sweet
On a slow jam
For my baby and for me

[Bridge: Usher, Monica & Both]
I'm trying to find someone who
I can give my good loving to
Never, ever did I dream I'd find someone, yeah
Now, I've been trying to find someone, too
I prayed to Heaven and then I found you
I swear, I fell in love the night you danced into my heart

[Chorus: Usher & Monica]
Play another slow jam (ah baby)
This time, make it sweet
On a slow jam
(Can I get a slow jam, do you want to slow jam?)
Play another slow jam
This time, make it sweet
(Can I get a slow jam, play another slow jam
Are you gonna slow jam?)

Play another slow jam
This time, make it sweet
On a slow jam
Play another slow jam
This time, make it sweet
On a slow jam....

[Hook]

In Magic City stacks of 20 big tall I throw
Keep it a 100 with the D cuz they all my folk

Got a matte black Rolls Royce, Bullet proof Denali

[Outro: T.I. Speaks and Skit]

[Verse 1]
I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn
I courted her proudly but now she is gone
Gone as the season she's taken

[Verse 2]
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us

[Verse 3]
Of the two sisters, I loved the young
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one
Their constant scrapegoat, she was easily undone
By the jealousy of others around her

[Verse 4]
For her parasite sister, I had no respect
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
As a crutch for her scenes and her society

[Verse 5]
Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused
The changes I was going through can't even be used
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime

[Verse 6]
With unseen consciousness, I possessed in my grip
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
To the sin of love's false security

[Verse 7]
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace
Answers of emptiness voice vacancies
'Til the tombstones of damage read no questions but please
What's wrong, what's exactly the matter?

[Verse 8]
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream
At the peak of the night, the king and the queen
Tumbled all down into pieces

[Verse 9]
"The tragic figure" her sister did shout
"Leave her alone, God damn you, get out"
And I in my armor, turning about
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness

[Verse 10]
Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground
And she in between, the victim of sound
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows

[Verse 11]
All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight
My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me

[Verse 12]
The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet
The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Will be fully aware of how precious she is

[Verse 13]
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me
"How good, how good does it feel to be free?"
And I answer them most mysteriously
"Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?"

[Hook]
Wish I could keep you much longer
I know you gotta go cause you got things to do
Wish I could keep you much longer
Now you too busy for me girl, like I was to you

[Post-Hook]
Wish I could stop by and maybe say "hi"
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side
Wish I could just stop by and maybe say "hi"
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side

[Verse 1]
The tables have turned
And I've finally learned
That this is making up for every day I was gone
And that's why I'm concerned
But now it's confirmed
That you spread your wings and learned to fly but all alone

[Pre-Hook]
Darkness in the night, I'll find that light for you
As long as I got eyes, I'll have a sight for you
Long as I'm alive baby, I'd die for you, wanna be with you

[Hook]
Wish I could keep you much longer
I know you gotta go 'cause you got things to do
Wish I could keep you much longer
Now you too busy for me girl, like I was to you

[Post-Hook]
Wish I could stop by and maybe say "Hi"
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side
Wish I could just stop by and maybe say "Hi"
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side

[Verse 2]
You're always on my mind, while I'm racin'
While I'm paper chasin'
You were there when I said one day I'd get up out that basement
Playin' as my agent
For you there's no replacement
You will always be my girl, you can hold me on that statement

[Pre-Hook]
Darkness in the night, I'll find that light for you
As long as I got eyes, I'll have a sight for you
Long as I'm alive, baby, I'd die for you, wanna be with you

[Hook]
Wish I could keep you much longer
I know you gotta go 'cause you got things to do
Wish I could keep you much longer
Now you too busy for me girl, like I was to you

[Post-Hook]
Wish I could stop by and maybe say "Hi"
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side
Wish I could just stop by and maybe say "Hi"
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side

[Bridge: Akon]
Baby, I know you and how we do
Doing exactly what I taught you
Gotta get that money first before you
Come spend that precious time with your boo
And know I gotta just take it
Even though it's drivin' me crazy
Always want to see my girl make it (ooh, yeah)

[Hook]
Wish I could keep you much longer
I know you gotta go 'cause you got things to do
Wish I could keep you much longer (I wish, I wish I could keep you so much longer)
Now you too busy for me girl, like I was to you

[Post-Hook]
Wish I could stop by and maybe say "Hi"
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side
Wish I could just stop by and maybe say "Hi"
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side

[Hook]
Wish I could keep you much longer (Wish I could keep you, baby)
I know you gotta go 'cause you got things to do
Wish I could keep you much longer (Wish I could keep you, baby)
Now you too busy for me girl, like I was to you

[Post-Hook]
Wish I could stop by and maybe say "Hi" (I just wanna keep you longer...)
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side
Wish I could just stop by and maybe say "Hi" (I just wanna keep you longer...)
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side

[Outro]
I just wanna keep you longer...
I just wanna keep you longer...

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
I got dosed by you and
Closer than most to you and
What am I supposed to do?

[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis]
Take it away, I never had it anyway
Take it away and everything will be okay

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
In you, a star is born and
You cut a perfect form and
Someone forever warm

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Way up on the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon, I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Show love with no remorse and
Climb on to your seahorse and
This ride is right on course

[Refrain 2: Anthony Kiedis]
This is the way I wanted it to be with you
This is the way I knew that it would be with you

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Way up on the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon, I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
I got dosed by you and
Closer than most to you and
What am I supposed to do?

[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Take it away I never had it anyway
Take it away and everything will be okay

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Way up on the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon, I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life

[Guitar Solo]
Lady with a Fan

Let my inspiration flow
In token rhyme suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake me
Till my tale is told and done

While the firelight's aglow
Strange shadows from the flames will grow
Till things we've never seen
Will seem familiar

Shadows of a sailor forming
Winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady
Many years ago

Here beside him stands a man
A soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights
But lost at love
While the storyteller speaks
A door within the fire creaks
Suddenly flies open
And a girl is standing there

Eyes alight with glowing hair
All that fancy paints as fair
She takes her fan and throws it
In the lion's den

"Which of you to gain me, tell
Will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you
If you will not take the chance"

The sailor gave at least a try
The soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength
And not disaster

The sailor coming out again
The lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today
You decide if he was wise

The storyteller makes no choice
Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light
And not to master
Since the end is never told
We pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will come back
But he cannot be bought or sold

Terrapin Station

Inspiration move me brightly
Light the song with sense and color
Hold away despair
More than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast
Statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb
To get to Terrapin

Counting stars by candlelight
All are dim but one is bright:
The spiral light of Venus
Rising first and shining best
(Oh)
From the northwest corner
Of a brand-new crescent moon
Crickets and cicadas sing
A rare and different tune
Terrapin Station
In the shadow of the moon
Terrapin Station
And I know we'll be there soon
Terrapin - I can't figure out
Terrapin - if it's the end or beginning
Terrapin - but the train's put its brakes on
And the whistle is screaming: Terrapin

At a Siding

While you were gone
These faces filled with darkness
The obvious was hidden
With nothing to believe in
The compass always points to Terrapin

Sullen wings of fortune beat like rain
You're back in Terrapin for good or ill again
For good or ill again

[Intro]
What, where am I?

[Verse 1]
What's life like on a train?
Nobody there knows your name
As your decision changed
Do you wish that I came?
I thought you'd pick me up from work
I waited for your truck for half hour
I know you said you were gonna
But I never thought you'd leave

[Chorus]
This one thing that was made for us
Chasing us, saving us
I take one thing over everything
I take that thing over anybody, oh

[Verse 2]
Square face and puppy eyes
Found out they never lied
Your old man lived in the sky
Left your house with a yard
But you went away a different try
Found a place that's your size
Too good to finish life here with me
I couldn't get you to say
Why you wouldn't let me come
What should be simple just ain't
And it shouldn't hurt like it does

[Chorus]
This one thing is made for us
Won't stay with us, it ain't saving us
But I'll take one thing over everything
I'll take that thing over anybody

[Bridge]
Baby, hold me, don't pick me up
I need a compliment
Just a touch from a friend
I need a gentle word
I need your company
I'll keep

[Chorus]
One thing that was made for us
Chasing us, saving us
I take one thing over anything
I take that thing over anybody
I take one thing over everything
I take that thing over anybody
Oh, oh, anything
Oh, oh, take one thing

[Verse 1]
And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

[Verse 2]
Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

[Verse 3]
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all, and I stood tall
And did it my way

[Verse 4]
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, oh, no, not me
I did it my way

[Verse 5]
For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

[Outro]
Yes, it was my way

[Verse 1]
Ain't it just like the night to play
Tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
We sit here stranded
Though we're all doing our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain, tempting you to defy it
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind

[Verse 2]
In the empty lot where the ladies play
Blindman's bluff with the key chain
And the all-night girls
They whisper of escapades out on the "D" train
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them that's insane
Louise, she's all right, she's just near
She's delicate and seems like the mirror
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place

[Verse 3]
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me
He's sure got a lotta gall
To be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall
Oh, how can I explain?
It's so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn

[Verse 4]
Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while"
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez, I can't find my knees"
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel

[Verse 5]
The peddler now speaks
To the countess who's pretending to care for him
Sayin', "Name me someone that's not a parasite
And I'll go out and say a prayer for him"
But like Louise always says
"You can't look at much, can you, man?"
As she, herself, prepares for him
And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road
He writes everything's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain

Fuck what they say 'bout my cases, fuck what they say 'bout my lady
Fuck what they say we were doing on the day of visitation
All I care 'bout is my out day and this next year of probation
How much dough I'm set to make, where I'm go'n go on vacation
Wait, damn. Okay that's way to far ahead of me
So I'm just tryna take it day to day if they would let a G, breath
Cop cars by the threes, Bitches call me Papa John cuz I keep that extra cheese
Overseas in the sun, livin' for the fun in Milan with some bad bitches
Probably one of yourn, when will it dawn on 'em I'm a Don
Ridin' foreign, curtains drawn, gettin' blown by a blonde, I'm the bomb
Terrorist, hella rich, wreckin' shit

Like a volcano head, lava runnin' out yo face
Hey, If yo ass out of place

What can I say? Another year, another case
Another sentence completed, I'm confident and conceited
I'm sucker free, sucker ducking, so tell them suckers to beat it
Don't fuck with me busta, trust me your future will be deleted
Such a G, ain't no touching me, luckely I defeated the odd
But out my to Allah and glory to God, and I ain't even Islamic
So sick, whenever I vomit just throw me a mill' or 2
And that ought to settle my stomach
'Bout some money he done it, call me Mr. He Run It
These niggas ain't really bout it, they just be speaking ebonics
I'm nothing short of iconic, promise you, you don't want it
Strong as gin and tonic, my left you won't see it coming
My right you'll be running from it, I catch you with it, you done

Word bond, real talk, do my dirt up by my only

You sucka niggas out of style G season

Jesus loves me
This I know
For the Bible tells me so

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Sometimes I wake up, feel like I’m in Forest City, Arkansas
Although I’m free, I’m still a prisoner of all I saw
Sometimes I leave this booth at 4 am, and ride down Simpson
Just prayin homie, and reminiscin
Sometimes my nightmare seems so real, feel like I’m still in prison
I reach out for Tameeka hand, I’m trippin 'cause she missin'
It’s pitch black dark, like I’m in solitary
So if my freedom was a dream, Lord, please prepare me
It seems like satan want my soul and he refuse to share me
My former friends talk about me like I'm dead and buried
Bastards want me in the casket for my head cold
Trouble in my soul, the devil got a hold
Did everything to me but kill me, like he did to Job
He took my diamonds, took my rhymes, took my fame and gold
He took my business interest, he took my wife and kids
But he can’t take nothing God can’t give me back again

[Chorus: Netta Brielle]
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I went to jail, stood tall, then I fell again
It seems like I'm Jonah and right back in that whale again
I felt the panic when they locked me in that cell again
I had to pray and meditate, control my breath again
Like Lazarus I’ve risen from a bed of death again
The Lord is with me, I could stand against a thousand men
I read the songs of David, prayed to be like Solomon
God’s wisdom walkin all amongst these hollow men
I’m a king, I dare to lead when they just follow men
I see a better way, I’m keeping my eyes on the sparrow
I’m exiting my Egypt, tell em wave goodbye to pharaoh
Mother told me before she left this earth that I was special
And because I’m special, they gon' make me suffer
Like they crucified Jesus right in front his mother
Suckas, but he arose on the third day
To save, you're here to give favor, let the church say

[Chorus: Netta Brielle]
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

[Outro: Netta Brielle]
Jesus loves me
This I know
For the Bible tells me so
Yes, He loves me
This I know
For the Bible tells me so

[Intro]
To the families of the December 14 tragedy

[Verse 1]
Today, We shed our tear for you
Tomorrow, we do it all again
They say, that time will make you better
I think, about what could’ve been

[Pre-Chorus]
Still, I believe that there is a whole lot of good people
I believe that there’s a lie
And I believe in more than things I can see my love
And I know this isn’t right

[Chorus]
But maybe this will make sense in heaven
And I’ll understand why you’re gone
Maybe this will make sense in heaven
Cause right now it don’t make sense at all

[Bridge]
Today—my prayers are in the sky
Tomorrow—they’ll still be there for you
They say-- that time will make you better
And I hope-- that what they is true

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I believe that there is a whole lot of good people
And I believe that there’s a lie
And I believe in more than things I can see my love
And I know this isn’t right

[Chorus]
Maybe this will make sense in heaven
And I’ll understand why you’re gone
Maybe this will make sense in heaven
Cause right now it don’t make sense at all
Yeah right now it don’t make sense at all

[Intro]
Ay
Ay Ay

[Hook]
Ayy everything ain't what it seem, ride dirty when I'm clean
Best check that disrespect unless you want it with the king
Put a address on that shit, who you talm 'bout? What you mean?
Wanna see me in the street, better bring some extra magazine
All that flexin and that poppin you be doin' for them hoes
I would run up with that choppa give it to you and them hoes
I for sure stunt, keep that dough coming
Man them suckas talkin' tough but trust me, they ain't on nothin'
Go!

[Verse 1]
Aye listen to me brah, don't bring that bullshit to me brah
Ain't no back and forth my nigga fuck with me, I'm torchin' niggas
Don't go to war unless your money right, room full of money
Hundreds not a 1 in sight, right
Aye look I can't afford a gun fight, haaa
But I can afford one life
All of that sucka shit, you broke and now you so upset
All that shit you kick around the city, get you no respect
I know a rap beef what you want, that shit I peeped then
You such a gangsta, get some money out the street then
Been in in the game 11 years, if I was such a ho
Nigga, I'd have been exposed 10 years ago
Never been robbed, never got my chain took
Never even been hit in my face, you don't believe? Look!
If people lookin' at me back when I was trigger happy
There wasn't no shoutin' matches I just got to gettin' at it

[Hook]
Ayy everything ain't what it seem, ride dirty when I'm clean
Best check that disrespect unless you want it with the king
Put a address on that shit, who you talm 'bout? What you mean?
Wanna see me in the street, better bring some extra magazine
All that flexin and that poppin you be doin' for them hoes
I would run up with that choppa give it to you and them hoes
I for sure stunt, keep that dough coming
Man them suckas talkin' tough but trust me, they ain't on nothin'
Go!

[Verse 2]
I swear to God, another day, another fuck nigga
That's why I just get that paper and be like, "Fuck niggas"
Sucka nigga, you were tough but now you done some
I'm done talkin', bust your gun if wanna run some
Hate to turn yo TV on every week and see my family hustle
And everbody in yo street just see your family struggle
What happened bruh? Guess your connect just be like, "Fuck 'em, dog"
No money when I see you I see none at all
That cheque I'm chasin' after never mind them hater rapper
Make they situation sticky like a Now-and-Later wrapper
Been fuckin' cities up, this shit ain't shit to us
Keep on, I show these folks on tape how you a sittin' duck

[Hook]
Ayy everything ain't what it seem, ride dirty when I'm clean
Best check that disrespect unless you want it with the king
Put a address on that shit, who you talm 'bout? What you mean?

[Intro]
Check, it's 6:26 in the morning
I just made this beat 'cause I realized that I enjoy playing the piano
Ah, you know, fuck you
No one is in the room with me right now so I'm gonna record myself
I'ma try and do this all in one take, so there's not a lot of editing
'Cause I'm too drunk to edit, and that's just the truth of the matter
Aight, let's go

[Verse]
Uh, I said raps is cold, about twenty below
I just realized I don't give a fuck any mo'
Used to look into the mirror askin', "Where will this go?"
Got big quick, kinda wish that I was takin' it slow
It takes balls to go and break from the mould, I guess I did that
I still got some dumbass fans who want K.I.D.S. back
And I forget that they twelve years old, I must accept that
Should probably stop thinkin' so much and just rap
I wish life was kinda easier to figure out
I wish it was like Ferris Bueller singin' "Twist and Shout"
I got a couple reasons that I'll stick around
But for the most part this shit is foul
I place my hand on a stovetop to see if I'm awake
I heard you takin' bath salts and eatin' people's face
Saw the people I know personally
I see they act a certain way because they workin' for me
And if you take that as a diss it means I'm talkin' to you
Know I never look down, I got knots in my shoe-strings
Made some money, went and bought me a few things
This ain't shit, I'm just doodling, haha
I'm sick of goin' to the movies and people lookin' at me
Inquire 'bout some shit that they know they shouldn't ask me
Hollywood got every girl around the world fasting
Like eatin' was a sin, when really beauty lie within
Guess I wouldn't fuck me a fat bitch
I just disagree wit'chu determining fat is
Wanna go to Israel and see if there's a God there
For now I'm 'bout to smoke some blunts and post in this lawn chair
Could've been the mayor 'cause I'm excellent with politicking
People never say what's on their minds because they on a mission
Who do you think you are?
And may God damn your soul if you forgot tradition
Locked inside a box, a prison, somewhere there I saw a vision
Met this girl with innocence and stole it while on top of linen
Rocket, word to Roger Clemens, that don't mean a thing
I'm in love with makin' melodies but scared to even sing
For you judgmental fuckheads, talkin' 'bout my life
You don't know me, and if you did, you'd say I'm nice
Everyone I see always has some cool advice
'Bout what they'd do if they were me and all the issues they would fight
You could never fathom what this shit is like
And I hope you turn your bitch to dyke
My kryptonite is me
Yeah

[Intro:]
Yo
Yeah, I'm on the way
Yeah, I had to pick up the new car
Aight
Aye, I'll be there in a minute
Aye, you dressed

[Hook: x2]
She had on purple panties, blue bikinis
And we were cruisin' in my Lamborghini
She had on purple panties, blue bikinis
And we were cruisin' in my Lamborghini

[Verse 1:]
I pull up shawty came out the house with it
Her bra and panties with her jacket, that's her outfit
Her heels fly, they real high
She used to it, she still fly
My ride new, her shoes on
She love to say she wanna take her top off
My car’s orange, her toes too
R. Kelly on, bumpin' that old school
She so so super bad, I move so super fast
Her feet up on the dash, I’m going super fast
She so relaxed, my windows black
Her legs wide open, can they see her while she's layin' in her

[Hook: x2]
She had on purple panties, blue bikinis
And we were cruisin' in my Lamborghini
She had on purple panties, blue bikinis
And we were cruisin' in my Lamborghini

[Verse 2:]
My tank full, the night young
Her eyes sayin' she want some
She on one, the stars out
Wonder if she thinkin' we can do it on the car now
I know she wanna play, it’s written all on her face
What’s in them purple bottoms
Girl, I sure want a taste
Pulled up and opened the door
Whole in that new aventador
We parked somewhere down she layin' up front and I’m kissin' on her

[Hook: x2]
She had on purple panties, blue bikinis
And we were cruisin' in my Lamborghini
She had on purple panties, blue bikinis
And we were cruisin' in my Lamborghini

[Bridge:]
Shawty look so good
She say she wanna do it in my ride
Look so good in my ride, she will do it in my ride
Shawty look so good
She say she wanna do it in my ride
Look so good in my ride, she will do it in my ride
So sexy, I just let her get it right on
Look so sexy in my ride, I just might buy her one
So sexy, I just let her get it right on
Look so sexy in my ride, I just might buy her one

[Hook: x2]
She had on purple panties, blue bikinis
And we were cruisin' in my Lamborghini
She had on purple panties, blue bikinis
And we were cruisin' in my Lamborghini

[Verse 1]
I never ever thought I'd live away
From everybody that I love and say goodbye
Now I'm the princess of a downtown train
Where everybody here, they know my game
But when I walk down the street I hear them say
"There she goes, that crazy girl...
She thinks she's something in this world."
So I'mma close my ears and dream 'cause life is never really what it seems
In every mystery, there's a truth
You know I'm telling, I'm telling you, uh-uh

[Chorus]
No matter lightning or thunder
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town
In a world unknown, you've got to hold your own
Yeah, you can't stop me
You're never, ever, ever gonna stop me now

[Verse 2]
On every street there is a memory
A time and place where we can never be again, uh-uh-uh-oh
Street lights glow red, green and yellow too
Do you let signs tell you what to do?
Yeah, when you say stop, be sure that I'll say "go"
To the stars and land
Fire can't burn these hands
But I just close my eyes and dream
You can't deny me, my strong mean
Hey
In every mystery, there's a truth
You know I'm telling, I'm telling you, uh-uh

[Chorus]
No matter lightning or thunder
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town
In a world unknown, you've got to hold your own
And you can't stop me
You're never, ever, ever gonna stop me now

[Bridge]
Go ahead and don't believe
Cause everyone needs a way to breathe, and love, and dream
And you can't stop me
You can't stop me

[Chorus]
No matter lightning or thunder
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town
In a world unknown, you've got to hold your own
And you can't stop me
You're never, ever, ever gonna stop me now

[Outro]
I never ever thought I'd live away from everybody that I love and say goodbye

[Verse 1]
I swear this famous shit just happened overnight
For sure these hoes was so uptight, but now they so polite
All I see is fake love, smiles, and overbites
But I'm pimping, nigga: Dolemite
I remember when, I was like ten, maybe nine
Ricky had a deuce-deuce, two shotty pumps with a baby nine
Busta had the rhymes, Puffy had the Shyne
Bone Thugs had Mo Thugs but that was the shit, that made me rhyme
What's up, what's on your mind? Hold up, I'm feeling fine
Locs got me blind, thugging like I'm Eazy-E up in his prime
Another young nigga with a attitude
I guess that's why the crackers kept me after school
Roaches on the wall, roaches on the dresser
Everybody had roaches but our roaches ain't respect us
On the park bench playing checkers, sipping nectar
Girbaud jeans with hologram straps and reflectors
We had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fistfights
And fish fries and shootouts like one Sig with two rounds
And one click left two down, that's four kids but one lived
Left three dead, but one split, that one miss, that one snitched
That's everyday shit, shit we used to that
Add it up, do the math with your stupid ass
Don't view me as no conscious cat, this ain't no conscious rap
Fuck the conscious crap, my mac'll push your conscience back
I do this for my culture, penny, nickels in the sofa
Mommy watching Oprah, Daddy in the kitchen whipping soda
Cook-connect named Sosa, Spanish chick Viola hit it in the chocha
With the Testarossa, hit Daytona, fuck the law, we soldiers
I'm 'bout it 'bout it, nigga ain't shit sweet about me
The baddest bitches on the block be even speaking 'bout me
I'm so thuggish ruggish bringing ruckus, knucking if you bucking
Young and thugging, bugging showing out in public, but you love it

[Bridge]
I only got one vision, that's for kids in every color, religion
That listen, we gotta beat the system, stay the fuck out the prisons
They try to blind our vision, but we all God children, we siblings
You my brother, you my kin, fuck the color of your skin

[Verse 2]
Back once again
Chilling in the back of the 'Lac with a pass or the gin
Finna ask can I pass to her friend
Then a nigga smash, I'll be damned if I ask her again
Gold slabs on the 'Lac when I spin
Then it's back to the back of the Benz
Lean back in the back with the Henn and a crap
When I tap that that, then attack, never tax, never that that
Max on the ends, spend ends, I remember way back when
A mothafucka used to have to borrow cash from my friends
Friends, just to put a snack up in the fridge
When I'm on, I swear to God to pay you back
Now the kids all look up to me
Them bitches wanna fuck with me
My idols say what's up to me
From ugly to comfortably, suddenly

[Outro]
It all changed man, it was just like yesterday
Times was so ugly and now I'm comfortable
I just only can thank God, suddenly
Everything changed before my eyes by my surprise
A$AP

[Verse 1]
We can jet, believe it, I know that you want
And yes, there's a feeling we both need to know

[Refrain]
Let us start now, it's that time
So let's travel and see the life

[Pre-Chorus]
(And I'm) Gonna take you out anywhere you wanna go now
(Tell me you'll ride) To the town where we both can party now (Now, now, n-n-now)

[Chorus]
Drink in London, dance in Paris
Let's chase our love, let's chase our love
Shout real loud now and let them hear us
Let's chase our love, let's chase our love
Tonight, night, night, night, night, night, night
Tonight, night, night, night
Let's chase our love, let's chase our love
Tonight, night, night
Tonight, night, night

[Verse 2]
If it's evening, we'll party 'til morning

[Refrain]
Let us start now, it's that time
So let's travel and see the life
(I'll watch it shine, shine, shine, shine, sh-sh-shine)

[Chorus]
Drink in London, dance in Paris
Let's chase our love, let's chase our love
Shout real loud now and let them hear us
Let's chase our love, let's chase our love
Tonight, night, night, night, night, night, night
Tonight, night, night, night
Let's chase our love, let's chase our love
Tonight, night, night
Tonight, night, night

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ayy, in my apartment a long time ago
I knew a bad bitch, but she was kinda slow
Still gave it up when it's a few of us
She let me finger-fuck her on the school bus
We used to cut school with her and run train
She wanted to hang with us, we wanted one thang
Just penetratin' that throat, dawg
She choked on it like smoke, dawg
But whenever I fucked up my re-up
In a dice game I go see her
She'll give me enough to buy a quarter ounce
And then blow a blunt of that reefer
She used to buy a nigga new sneakers
Pay the bill on my beeper
Just so she can page to put a "69"
And I know it time to go freak her
Then one day I just asked her
"Why you always give your ass up?
I mean, damn, these hoes get paid
All you do is get laid—this shit don't add up."
She said, "Tip, all I wanna do is feel love
Even if I know it ain't real love
Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it
And then never call back, I still fuck."
And that's fucked up, but she so trill
I need somethin', she go steal
When the trap hot and police ride
Nigga, guess where we go chill?
For 'bout four years she held dope
And my four pounds 'til it go down
I remember shawty, she stayed down
I won't say her name ‘cause she married now

[Chorus: Kris Stephens]
When the lights go out
And I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had
All of the things I did back then

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
She would always turn heads when she'd fall through
She would always make moves how a boss do
And she never gave any nigga time of day
But she the chick all the niggas tried to talk to
But when it came to me, she had a thing for me
When we kicked it she roll up the weed for me
And we'd both cut class post up in the cut steady
Watchin' just to see if the police comin'
We got close over time, her and I
Right around the time that I first got signed
Come to think about it I was 'bout 17
I ain't even have a license, couldn't even drive
I was goin' back and forth with each flight
Another show after show, each night
She became so suspicious of these other bitches
She'd go through my phone and we'd fight
Talk about torn between the two
Wasn't really much more that we could do
Wasn't really much space for us
But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do
But I guess one night I had a few
Huh, one night I had a few
Yeah, this little chick that caught my eye
I told her: "Hurry up, meet me at the room!"
And no, I didn't have a contraceptive
What my common sense neglected
And two months later, next thing I know
I got a text that said "I'm pregnant"
And you can almost bet she kept it
And that's the reason why you left me
On top of all that, it wasn't even mine
I went and got paternity tested—damn!

[Chorus: Kris Stephens]
When the lights go out
And I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had
All of the things I did back then

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Wait, hol' up, is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
Jay 305 had gave me high five
When I said I’m in hot pursuit
You said, "I won’t ride until Kendrick drive
A new Monte Carlo that cruise"
And that shot my pride, I tried to improv
But no freestyle I never do
You lookin' for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti
You overlookin' every nigga that ain’t quite ready
To make it rain on you like I'm about to break a levee
Hol' up, that pussy petty
Yeah, your nails did, your hair did
Your cell phone is selfish
It only got numbers that come with a Hummer
Her new prima donna I smelt it
Tried to make you mine, ho!
Tried to make some time, ho!
But I ain’t got the time or the patience
To stop and wait in line, ho!
Her dreams holds Versace
She fall for Armani
Only deal with rich niggas—fuck you and Mick Romney!
I’m grown now, I’m on my own now
I’m po-o-o-oppin'
Change my phone now when I get home now
I got o-o-o-options
Fast forward, wait, is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
And your three kids and three baby daddies
Same car note that’s overdue? I know

[Chorus: Kris Stephens]
When the lights go out
And I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had
All of the things I did back then

Steam rolling whatever I see, huh
Despicable me
I’m having a bad bad day
If you take it personal thats ok
Watch this is so fun to see, huh
Despicable me

[Verse 1: Fixedgear E]
Why cook Top Ramen, when u claim u top dog
Why try and hide behind all that fog
Why u keep playing, when I'm undefeated
And why these other fools always get beasted
Why I gotta come out dressed like grim reaper
Why I be so O.G. Like beepers?
Better not come see me, that wouldn't be smart
I'll paint the town red, and call it street art

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fixedgear E]
Why burn slow when there's napalm
Why drop knowledge when I can drop bombs
Why everything about me so mean
And why I gotta fux with all of this lean
Why u think u finna win when I'm Autobots
But the better question is why not
I got more gadgets than terminator
Future celebrity problems while I'm trying to be greater

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fixedgear E]
Better run home before it gets dark
Me and my boys mobbin' like sharks
I have too much swag for you lames
Better bring a pen n take notes of my game
If you touch my girl, ill break your arm
Chop u up like a cow at a farm
Y'all haters keep adding fuel to my fire
I'm future hall of fame when I retire

Block Beaters
Make my dream real
Bl-bl-bl-bl-block Beaters

Moving at the speed of sound
With my head up in the clouds
Moving at the speed of sound
With my head up in the clouds
Yeah yeah, my life's like

[Hook: Mike Posner]
Moving at the speed of sound
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
With my head up in the clouds
Yeah yeah, my life's like
Moving at the speed of sound
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
With my head up in the clouds

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
My ma keeps telling me
I better stay in school
But when that ends, Lord knows
I don't know what I'm going to do

[Hook: Mike Posner]
Cause everytime I blink now
Another day rolls by
It's getting harder not to think about
All the things on my mind
Like, I remember this time last year
I was all alone
I felt like I was two feet tall
Now there's a hundred million numbers
Inside of my phone
But I still got no one to call
My life's like

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
My friends keep telling me
How much they believe in me
I wish that I saw the things that they see in me

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
My life's like
My life's like
Ay, do it, ay, music, ay
High rise, elevator life
I'm gone in 60 seconds
On Talladega nights
I know I'm living wrong
I wish I could make it right
But baby, hold that thought...
Cause I gotta take this flight
Where'd I leave my passport
Overseas passports
Hotels with the glass floors
Everything I ask for
Fast cars, fast hoes
My whole life is fast foward
But if I stop, stop
I might hit that dashboard
And I be, I be
I be, I be always takin trips
In and out relations with
Girls who want relationships
And I can fake a smile
And a conversation when
We just can't see eye to eye
We might need that LASIK shit
Cause tomorrow I'll be (gone gone gone)
Dip into another time (zone zone zone)
Tryna make my hotel feel like (home home home)
Phone won't stop ringing but I still feel all alone
My life's like

[Hook]

(Move it up, bring it up, bring it up, up up

[Intro]
Hey, what's happenin'?
It's been a minute, huh? I'm just hollerin'
How you doin?

[Verse 1: T.I.]
It's been a minute since I seen ya, I fell off of the scene
Cause it seem like you wanted other things than the king
Why you fightin', fussin', cussin', and disagreein' with the king?
When you got cribs, cars, bling, and a king with the king?
Is the grass as green as it seemed in ya dreams
Are you gettin' all the things that you needed and I ain't bring
It satisfy your self-esteem bein' seen on the screen?
Is this new nigga the real thing or is just a little fling?
Did he buy a nice bracelet and get you a little ring
Or give you the attention and all of the little things?
He know what to do with the stuff that you stuff in them little jeans?
Do he stand up and lean in it 'til you start screamin'
Or smack your ass and kiss your g-string to start eatin?
You get how you need it, not only when it's convenient
I just pick up the phone and call you every week or two
To let you know I miss you and see how that nigga treatin' you

[Hook: Governor King]
I remember morning, noon, and night I used to hold you tight
I know we used to fuss and fight
But I'm just calling to say, "Hello, hello baby"
See time has its own funny way of keeping us close
Even though we never stayed, together
I just wanted to say, "Hello, hello baby"

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Hello? Ay, it's me
Hey, what's happenin'? How ya doin'? I know plenty of niggas pursuin'
Them panties, all for the screwin', fly you down to Miami
Let you walk the red carpet when I'm out at the Grammys
But I'm what he can never be, a boss, understand me?
You pose and take pictures of things he buy for ya
He got you roses, but that don't mean that he'll die for ya
Hey, maybe I got too much pride to cry for ya
But not too much to call you and tell you that I adore ya
And tell you how I'm missin you, lovin' you and kissin' you
I think about the good old days and wanna visit you
This song I'd like to listen to whenever reminisicin' you
You, stay on my mind, never mind how I picture you
Think about the past and all the time that I spent witchu
Rubbin' on that ass from behind as I dig in you
Never been a doubt in my mind that I was diggin' you
How I love you shorty, you'll never find another nigga to

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Governor King]
Every now and then I think of you
And I can't lie I be wantin' you
But I understand that I'm not your man
And I also know that the future's not in your hands
So every now and then I'll call you
To say, "How you doin'?" and, "Baby I miss you, girl"
This is just to say, "Hello, hello baby"

[Hook]

[T.I. talking]
Live and direct from the traps of the A-town, nigga
West side, Bankhead, nigga
Pimp Squad Clique, nigga
Grand Hustle, pimp
Say I'm mad, huh?
Your faggot ass gon' be mad in a minute (Sissy ass nigga)
(Hey, let's go, nigga) I'mma hit your faggot ass in the mouth when I see ya, nigga
Fuck what you heard, homie, leprechaun ass nigga

King of the place called home of the bass
He emerged at the trap, from the zone of the flake
Caught a case, and he still keep a chrome on his waist
For the haters in the face gettin' thrown in the way
Like a pussy nigga named Lil' Wesley, tryna test me
On your best behavior what your faggot ass best be
Choose words carefully when you address me
You ain't gotta like me, but you're gonna respect me
(Or else) or else you get wet like a jet ski
Take ten of these and live, that'll impress me
Say I wanna rap on your songs but you ain't let me
See you on the front of The Source, like that upset me
Fuck you in the ass, I ain't mad 'bout shit
Try Tip, shot quick, that's all your ass gon' get
And I ain't finna put a mask on, Flip
I'mma empty out the clip and your ass gon' flip
Bet your mom and your dad gon' trip
But them the consequences try to mash on Tip
Nigga, lyrically I'll murk you, physically I'll hurt you
You ain't never ran the streets, you had a curfew
Pussy nigga playing with me, you'll be in the dirt soon
Look you in the eye see you sweet like perfume (muah)
So go on, keep running you dick suckers
I'mma swing, show the world that you just a big sucker
Daddy shoulda got some head, bet he wish he woulda worn rubber
But he didn't, so now I guess the world gotta suffer
You the kind of wanksta, gangsta's done had enough of
So I'mma take pride when I ride through and bust you
Tip will be the reason for the saddest day your momma seen
When I let this K slay a nigga like the Drama King
Better find a nigga to try, nigga I ain't the one
I got 99 problems, Lil Flip ain't one (ha, hey, hey)
I got 99 problems, Lil Flip ain't one
This pussy nigga wanna beef well he find him some
I got 99 problems, Lil Flip ain't one (ha, hey, hey)

Fuck, boy you wanted beef, well you found you some

[Lil Flip]
Scarface the king of the South

[T.I.]
Pussy nigga, shut the fuck up
I'm cool with Face and even he know that you're a sucker
Paul Wall runnin' Texas along with Slim Thug
Mike Jones, ESG, and Z-Ro some real hustlers
Never been a Botany Boy, you just a buster
Never been seen outside on the Southside
Sucka nigga puttin' on like you run shit
After Third go to jail with this leprechaun shit
Half the time you don't like what I'm saying then buck
Nigga, swing when you see me, nigga, I don't give a fuck!
Cause I know you just a lame and your partners ain't tough
Know your aim ain't shit and know your fight game suck
So I couldn't image you what G's would wanna listen to
Just some kids, women, and a lot of homosexuals
I'm a stand up guy man I'm into principle
All you do is lie, and everything you say is fictional
I demand my respect, I'll die about that
But I'mma hit you with the tek, and let you lie about that
So keep me out your raps or this shit ain't done
I got 99 Problems, Lil Flip ain't one (come on)
I say, 99 problems, Lil Flip ain't one
Pussy nigga wanted beef well he found him some
I got 99 probelms, Lil Flip ain't one

[T.I. talking]

You wanna see me, nigga? Come see me, nigga

[Intro: R. Kelly]
Hey, I got a question for the ladies out there
Yeah, cause there's a few things that I would like to know
Before I fuck with you

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Oh, baby could you learn
Could you learn to love a trouble man?
Oh, baby could you learn
Could you learn to love a trouble man?

[Verse 1: T.I.]
You sure you wanna roll with me? I'm a complicated man
Live my life close to the edge, it ain't near safe to stand
I'm Trouble Man, always into something
Numb to the consequences, guess it's coming if it's coming
But so much shit they say that I can't do because I'm famous
Guess I should live in a bubble like these other entertainers
The danger's so enticing to me, I don't even notice it
Guess I get away or get arrested before it's over with
Prison sentenced every year, got everybody after me
Reaper on my heels, I'm just praying he don't catch a G
Imagine me and you, somewhere happy with a few hundred mills
Sill I could go to jail for some years
Cause I push it to the limit, the danger's so exciting
I'm loving every minute, girl this life ain't nothing like it
And you only live once so as long as I'm alive
I'll be living on the edge
Shawty, sure you wanna ride?

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Oh, baby could you learn
Could you learn to love a troubled man?
Oh, baby could you learn
Could you learn to love a troubled man?

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Yeah, hey, hey and they say if the drugs ain't the death of me
The lifestyle will be!
Law keep arresting me, sucker wanna kill me
Still we're in the fast lane, grind break, next speed
A million dollar sports car, smoking on the best weed
Fist fights in night clubs for rap beefs
Shootings, retaliations, yeah, it's that deed!
I guess they just got to catch me when they catch me
Cause I'm putting it in they life if they attempt to disrespect me
Especially since I know they say what go around come around
That's why when we go around I keep a gun around
The bullshit, there be none around here
But I got a secret though, I wanna change, I swear!
But suckers won't let me and feds still sweat me
So I'm looking for the worst to have you praying for the best
Think you can help me if they get me?
Could you handle shit for me?
Think about it!
Is your body shorty, answer this for me

[Hook: R.Kelly]
Oh, baby (exactly)
Could you learn?
(Think you could learn to love a nigga like me?)
Could you learn to love a troubled man
(I know what I need) yeah! (and it's worth it, you know)
Yeah, yeah, baby could you love?
(Just think about it for a second)
Could you learn to love a troubled man, yeah?
(I mean could you find me near?)
I deserve you!

Girl, would you give me a number?
If I had an OK car, not much money
9 to 5 with a future on me, oh
Tell me, would you ever fuck with a brother like me?
(If I did time in my life, time, time in my life
Time, time in my life)
Tell me, would you give your sex to me?
I really want to know
(If I was fighting in the club, fighting in the club
Fight, fighting in the club, fighting in the club)
Hey lady,could you learn
Learn to love a troubled man?

[Outro: T.I]
Hey, hey, hey baby
Could you learn (tell me could you learn?)
Could you learn to love a troubled man?
(I mean if you knew he was really
Really a good-hearted person, man
Do you think you could put up the bullshit to the outside, man?
I mean if you saw the good qualities within, man
Could you, could you ignore all the bullshit that they are saying?
I'm a product of my environment
I can only act as good as life allows me to act
You know what I'm saying so
What I need is a good influence like you
You know what I'm saying?
Think you can find me, Lord?

[Intro: Akon]
1, 2, 3 - ooh yea
Ooh oh-oh...
I hope you don’t mind, I hope you don’t mind
That I put down in words... how won-der-ful life is

[Verse 1]
Hey TIP, lemme holla at ya...
Making yo momma proud, looking in yo daughter’s eyes
Kickin' it with your sons, trippin', never realize
How good you got it, been so wrapped up in yo losses
You couldn’t see the profits, could still be in the projects
Instead releasing projects just poppin when niggas floppin
So you went back to prison, TIP? It could've been a coffin
Now since we talkin', you been trippin' ever since I died
Appreciate you missin' me but G, you still alive
I’m lookin' down at you, and sendin' smiles to you
I checked the wedding out, oh tell Tamika hi would you?
Told you she would get you, that’s good cuz shawty ride with you
Kids getting big, seen King riding a bicycle
See Niq Niq drive a car, see Bubba big as you
I see Domani rappin, and he’s spittin too
Little Deyjah beautiful, and Major supercool
My life is over with dawg, your life is good to you

[Hook: Akon]
And you can tell everybody, this is your song
And you can tell everybody, this is your song
I hope you don’t mind, I hope you don’t mind
That I put down in words... how won-der-ful life is

[Verse 2]
Sit down, son...
And listen to me son, and pay attention to me
Seems like I’m the only one that you would listen to
I never knew the time that I ain’t get to spend with you
Would ever result in you making yourself miserable
You gotta let it go, it’s painful, I already know
The past is the past, just learn from the grown
So you got crystal wit you? And your sister Precious too
I’m proud of you, did better than I expected you to
Although I knew you was special when you was smaller
That’s why I was so much harder on you, knew you were smarter
Not much convo to offer, I wasn’t much of a talker
Great to see you doin better than me, even as a father
Taking care of yo mama, overcoming the drama
Your life is wonderful son, don’t let em take it from you
Keep living it to the fullest, treasure it, it’s a blessing
Be thankful for all this beauty, when it’s over with forget it

[Hook: Akon]

[Verse 3]
Damn...
What up, Phil? So good to hear from you, we missing you (f'real)
Remembering all of our conversations, daily reminiscing you
The hood, today they lost, can tell they don't know who to listen to
Today I watch over Jeanette like she was my own and that could missing you
I swear it’s so unfair that I’m right here and you up there
I miss you so much now to the point I call your name but you not there
Now I can’t rest and I can’t do shit off my mind, I’m so upset
It wasn’t your time to beat me there, broke my heart to see you dead
Shot with bullets that were meant for me, familiy's never forgiving me
I know, but all I could do was follow your memory
But pops I thank you so much for leaving, I had to grow up
Slanging crack on the corner ain’t quite the future you wanted for me
Was it? And this pain I feel it never goes away
Does it? This load I carry get no lighter
I grew up all on my own with a broken heart and a broken home
Taught me everything I’ve known, owe you everything I own
I must admit you raised a warrior, my life could be a story book
Hope you proud of me, didn’t graduate from college but
Thanks for listening to me, so long, had this bottled up
Til we meet in person let’s keep speaking through my verses for life

[Hook: Akon]

[Outro: Akon]
This is your song...

[Produced by HitBoy]

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, feelin' like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers, get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetery with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinkin' 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out, huh
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar—
Dee, probably sellin' D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
We outlawed, then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, "Doo, doo," I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, "Mmm, mmm!"
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9s on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say R.I.P., I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must have froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed to
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed to, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Barely even conscious, talkin' to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately, I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail but when I preach I only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

[Verse 4: Yelawolf]
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park, dirt-ditch-diggin'
Burger-flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body-double or couple me to these others
'Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginnin' again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? Great! Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up—wait! No, I don't give a
Flying duck nothin' but a buckshot; ch-pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood-clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show—Yelawolf

[Verse 5: Danny Brown]
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy 'cause I'm high like Michael Jackson, penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch, when I say this, I mean this
Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, it's like from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw, shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich's posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka, prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic, 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?

[Verse 6: Action Bronson]
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker, so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should have stayed with me
Now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the mornin' on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinkin' Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin', I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scramblin', sellin' Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn, this shit tastes like fantastic, uh
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I've got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I'm a free man, try not to eat ham

[Verse 7: Big K.R.I.T.]
Big K.R.I.T., shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'lac with flats
After that, bottles I can't pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love and all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm, slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I've been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I'm taxin' if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin' grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my soul, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hopin' the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you'll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That wasn't no sample, nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, poppin' benji tags on your wifey's ass (on your wifey's ass)
That's out of line, but in livin' color?
I'm more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers: a true artist
Yea
I got that charisma girl bout me now baby (Yea)
Blink I love you for this one boy (Ha Ha)

[Hook:]
Yea, flashy, fly lil nigga

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
All I think about is life, nights, sipping on Sprite
Little codeine, nigga get throwed right
Two blonde dykes wanna kiss all night
I just pray to God that the shit go right
Little argument, and their fists don't fight
Fuck a dog ho and the bitch gon' bite
A$AP nigga, sip Cris all night
So them R. Kelly hoes getting pissed on twice
Damn, how a young nigga get so nice?
Young nigga cold like he sitting on ice
Fuck broke, tryna be rich all life
I coulda been a criminal and just rolled dice
My nuts hanging, my top back
Hoes screaming that Pac back
Throwing Westside, bandana tied
A$AP life, got a Pac tat
Harlem world my whole block strapped
Hoes all on my jock strap
My whip white but my top black
And my bitch white but my cock black
Purple drink? Got that
Tell these hoes all to twerk something
Bounce on me bitch, hurt something
Tell her pop that pussy like it's worth something
So shorty, she a stunner and daddy, he a runner
Be that pretty mothafucka, you could call me what you wanna
Cause I'm in love with that ass, she in love with the cash
So she shaking it fast and then making them stacks
And I'm taking it back and I'm taking her back
To the house just to bust in her mouth and I'm kicking her out

[Bridge]
How 'bout me and you and you and I
Take a ride to make this high
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on

[Chorus]
So I say pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed
That's all a nigga need

[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q]
It's A$AP Q, where the bread at?
Fuck around and bring the hush puppies back
She fuck me and the homies, she was cool with that
The block hot so I'm shaded in my bucket hat
Pause a little bit, I gotta little advice
If you fucked her once, then you could fuck her twice
And don't get head from hoes with overbites
Just giving out game, nigga show your right
Born stunna nigga, turn night to bright
High as a kite in my Nike Flights
Made 30 Racks it was just a flight
Flew a bitch out too, it was just a night
Shorty got the booty make a nigga say, "Whoa"
Can I suck your titties, tryna see how far I can go
Try again and then again and she ain't telling me no
Sweetie tell me how you feeling, can I feel on you more?
She said, "I ain't fucking for free," but ain't shit I can't afford
Shit, I'll pay you for it, now bounce that ass on my bungee cord
Yeah, whoopsie daisy, put a good kid in your Section.80
Turn a baby into a lady, now here go the keys to my new Mercedes
Cause shawty she a stripper, all you got to do is tip her
She like ballers with some money screaming fuck them other niggas
Now do A through Z for a G, panties go down to her feet
Pussy get wetter for me, smackin' that ass to the beat, give her that Diggity-D

[Bridge]
How 'bout me and you and you and I
Take a ride to make this high
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on

[Chorus]
So I say pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed
That's all a nigga need

Fuck I'm 'sposed to do with all this new ass?
Fuck I'm 'sposed to do with all this new cash?
Thousand dollar drawers just to hold my balls
All I ever do is let my jewels sag
Pac gone, but the "Juice" back
Get your popcorn, juice, snacks
It's a movie nigga, with a new cast
Get the news flash, that the truth back
This is boom bap, mixed with new raps

Even cracked the pavement that's for niggas hating
I been impatiently waiting to show you niggas Satan
All this talk of Illuminati ain't got a clue about me
Bitch, I'm Trillmaluminati and got my crew behind me
Shooters round me, keep them looters round me
Keep a tool around me, it'll keep you fools from round me
Couple of them dudes surround me
With a gat, with a strap in a backpack
When they cap cap, leave you flat, better back back
On a fast track, ratatat, nigga that's that
Nigga pass that, finna ash, where the hash at
Got a Kat Stacks with a ass, finna smash that
Make 'em catch that, A$AP, then I pass that
Off to my niggas then she ask, "Where the cash at?"
I see dead people, I need dead people
Lord Pretty Flacko, bitch, I behead people
Kneel and kiss the ring, all hail the King
Long Live A$AP put that on everything

[Outro: Haim]
Alright, mothafucka
Alright, A$AP
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love
It's bout time I reacted
Look at what y'all did to this rap shit
Knowin' niggas is wrong,come on with the cat shit
Wack shit,get niggas torn down,slapped quick
Blam,blam,blam...go down that quick
Actin' like the truth was gone
And I'm sayin' gotta deal with the ruthless one
It's 2 piece,leave your faggot ass toothless son
I go hard,dog don't do it!,too late,it's done
Hold up,I'ma show you why dog is the illest,kill this
You might not catch it,but you'll feel this
The realest nigga to ever do it,the realest nigga to ever go through it
And y'all gon' bring me back to it
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Middle name is grime,came from crime
Thought I'mma change by time,niggas don't know me
But you can't hold somethin'
You ain't got it,show me

[Intro: DMX]
Ugh, check it out, y'all
Haha! Check it out, y'all
On that motherfucking West Coast shit
'Cause I'm on the best coast, bitch
And niggas know how it's going dizzy
We on some East shit
That beast shit, yah'mean?

[Verse 1: DMX]
One in the back left ya faggot ass face down
Lucky that you breathing but you dead from the waist down
Fuck is on your mind? Talking that shit that you be talking
And I bet you wish you never got hit 'cause you'd be walking
But shit happens and fuck it, you done did your dirt
Niggas is wondering, how the fuck you hid your skirt?
Right under they eyes, imagine surprise to the guys
That one of they mans was a bitch in disguise
I'm fucking with cats that order more hits and slaughter more kids
Let me holla at you yo the Baltimore shit
Nah mean? I'm just robbin to eat
And there's at least a thousand of me like me mobbin' the street
When we starvin' we eat whatever's there
Come on, you know the code in the streets, whatever's fair
Bloodstains and chalk, means your man couldn't walk
After the talk, about him not bein' on 1130B to New York
And transforming ass niggas will get it quick
And yo, for real, that nigga 2Pac can suck my dick
And it's gonna take all them niggas in the West Coast
To barely move me, 'cause when I blow shit up
I have niggas fallin' like white bitches in a scary movie
Ahhh! You know I don't know how to act
I get too close to niggas, it's like:
"Protected by Viper, stand back"
What's this? I thought you niggas was killers, demented
Fuck y'all want me to do wit this coward? "Finish him!" It's ended

[Outro]
East heard the west is, craving for a nightmare
Aight!
Craving for a nightmare

[Verse 1]
Bloody ink on my pad spelled suicide
Michael Jackson even passed cause you scrutinized
Fuck Illuminati lies, say I'm lucified
Baptized in the gutter, motherfucker you decide
Cause the ride come with doors that be suicide
Or the thighs on my whores, they be super-sized
Good and bad having wars, nigga, choose a side
Now all hail to the Lord like you do to God
Who am I? Lord Flacko
Painting vivid pictures, call me Basquiat, Picasso
Capo Head Hancho, now my following's colossal
Ain't no boxer, Pacquiao, but got the chopper todo caso
It's like you heard God spoke, I seen the ghetto gospel
The choir like my reefer and the preacher got my eyes low
Sister Mary Jane to make me sleep from singing high notes
The bible or the rifle, goodnight folks

[Verse 2]
Bloody ink on my pen spelled suicide
Kurt Cobain even died cause you scrutinize
It's a fine line between truth and lies
Jesus Christ never lied, still was crucified
That's why I never judge another nigga
Life's a bitch, but that bitch in love with other niggas
3 to a bed, sheets, no covers nigga
Dirty kitchen, no supper in the cupboards nigga
Sucker niggas, wassup with niggas?
So my new attitude is like "Fuck them niggas!"
I grew up with niggas but don't fuck with niggas
I don't trust them niggas, ain't got no love for niggas
Had the gold grills shining like them southern niggas
Kept it trilla, now the whole world fuckin' with us
Meanwhile, you treated all of us like other niggas
Now your world is in my palm, take cover niggas

[Bridge]
If I shall ever fall, Lord pick me up
Ever since a baby, two deuce in sippy cups
Ever since them diapers and my zip-me-ups
Now I'm walking on my own, y'all, wish me luck

[Outro]
Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
It's all part of the plan
Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
It's all part of the plan

[Hook]
I see you driving around town
With the girl I love and I'm like: "fuck you!"
Ooh, ooh, oooh
I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough; I'm like: "fuck you!"
And fuck her too!
Said if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shit?
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a: fuck you!
Ooh, ooh, oooh

[Joell Ortiz]:
Word, damn Evette
You ridin' round town in that man's Corvette
We went half on my welfare check
I'm sick I ain't even get my health care yet
That's it
F you and your stank ass
Hope your weave fall out and the train crash
On the way to get your hair did
And your nails chip and your feet hurt cause your heel rip
And when you go home complainin' he beat yo' ass
Mess up your teeth so bad
That you can only eat your mash, potatoes
Anyway, your food so bad, the neighbors
Probably throw your steak out
Yeah, I was lyin' about never being hungry
I spent money on that take out
I find a better woman any day
Kiss my ass
Your breath smell like shit anyway

[Hook]
I see you driving around town
With the girl I love and I'm like: "fuck you!"
Ooh, ooh, oooh
I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough; I'm like: "fuck you!"
And fuck her too!
Said if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shit?
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a: fuck you!
Ooh, ooh, oooh

[Verse 2]
Now I know that I had to borrow
Beg and steal and lie and cheat
Trying to keep ya, trying to please ya
Cause being in love with your ass ain't cheap

[Bridge]
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(Oh shit, she's a gold digger)
Well.. (just thought you should know nigga)
I've got some news for you
("...ooh, I really hate yo ass right now.")

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now baby, baby, baby, why d'you wanna wanna hurt me so bad?
I tried to tell my momma but she told me
"This is one for your dad"
(Your dad, your dad, your dad)
Why? Uh! Why? Uh!
Why lady? Oh I love you
Oh, I still love you, ooh

[Hook]

Niggas got rips in they jeans, man, I started that

Niggas claim they the God of black
Well your name is purple, I'm the God of that
Gave you my back, nigga, pardon that
Fuck that shit, I brought mobbin' back
Brought robbin' back
Brought the Garden back
Motherfuck Black Land, I brought Harlem back
Rollin' in my Benzo
Hoes on the curb, a couple of friends
Rollin' down my windows
Yo, what's the word? Fuck it, get in
And ride 'round with these bimbos
She gave head to my kinfolk
Shout outs my connect though
Keep a watch out for them Winslows
'Cause the boys' gon' creep, D-boys gon' serve
Hoes gon' skeet and the V gone swerve
I'ma get by while the world gon' turn
I'ma get mine like you gon' get yours
Niggas do the least when the piece got nerve
Niggas in the streets when the heat got burned
I'll tell a nigga, "Be you"
Fuck tough, be cool
Couple young niggas down with my crew who be down to let it fly

[Pre-Chorus]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Rows and floes of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

[Verse 2]
But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

[Chorus]
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

[Verse 3]
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way that you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

[Verse 4]
But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

[Chorus]
I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

[Verse 5]
Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say "I love you" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

[Verse 6]
But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

[Chorus]
I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life
At all

[Chorus]
I've looked at life from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life
At all

[Verse 1]
Wake up feeling blessed up, pistol on that dresser
Ain't afraid to show it, I'll expose it if I dress up
Riding in that Testa...rossa, nigga catch up
Sipping on that syrup, till I'm messed up, like yes sir
So now I'm getting change, people looking at me strange
Like nigga switching lanes, never changed, still the same
We fuck bitches, get paper, you fuck niggas on papers
We walk around with lasers, you prolly own some tasers
Lame niggas disgrace us, they girlfriends want date us
Got different hoes, I'm pimpin' hoes, you could tell by my paystubs
My niggas gettin' right, smokin' weed with dirty Sprite
I'm going wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'

[Verse 2]
Finna wild out for the weekend, me, myself, and I – my three friends
Nigga feeling froggy, then leap in, A$AP niggas finna sneak in
Middle finger to the critics, me and my nigga Skrillex
You know we finna kill it, A$AP we the trillest
You don't really want that Glock boy
You don't really wanna feel them shots boy
You a b-boy, I'm a block boy, I'm a D boy, I'm a hot boy
Six shots got me feelin' like 'Pac, boy, party all night, shit don't stop, boy
Drunk as fuck, and I'm ready to fight
Wilding for the night, fuck being polite, boy

[Chorus]
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'

[Verse 3]
It's the weekend and I'm creeping with my niggas
Drunk and disrespectful, callin' women bitches
I don't mean no harm but won't you and your friends-es
Meet us in the cut and we can do the business
God my witness that I only wanna kick it
And your girl just said they with us
So we rolling in them Benzes
Won't you pour it up and stop the babysitting
She got drunk as fuck and swallowed all my kids-es

[Verse 4]
Back to the Mac, tats on her back
Ass so fat, hit that from the back
When it clap from the back, she clappin' it back
She flat on her back and it's back to the trap
Fuck your pack, A$AP where it's at
Fuck nigga act, get clap lay flat
Fuck your dreams, leave a punk nigga dreamin'
Then you sleep, and you won't come back from the nap

On my Ou-Outkast, daddy fat, bitches on my sack
And you know them smokin' bitches rolling reefer got me open
Wildin' to the morning with my homies, tell 'em where we goin'

[Chorus]
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'

[Intro: Imogen Heap & A$AP Rocky]
Do just what I tell you (Uh)
Don't come in any closer (Uh)
And no one will get hurt
‘Cause I don't know how long I can hold my heart in two (Uh)

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
A rebel I be one day
On that track with Gunplay
Out-outcast my whole life so I decide to spit like André (Uh)
Beef is on my entrée (Yeah)
Gin and juice, that's Bombay
Driving fast the wrong way, I swear life is like a one-way (Uh)
Pussy on a Sunday (Yeah)
Business on a Monday (Yeah)
My new crib came with feng shui and my closet is like a runway (Uh)
Come be my fiancée
She fuck me in a Hyundai
My rooftop got a lounge, just sit around and watch her sunbathe (Yeah)
Dinner date for one K (Bitch)
Shopping date for two K (Bitch)
Bougie-ass bitch made me wait to fuck for two days (Yeah)
Finally got it today (Uh)

Don't come in any closer

[Verse 2: Gunplay & A$AP Rocky]
Whip-whippin' Whitney, my mama as a witness
Bitches lickin' and lockin' up my Swishers
Once she blow my whistle, she know it's dismissal
Spread the news, I'm official, now hop out my foreign vessel (Uh)
Before I get aggressive forget it, war-ready
Already tested, tears and blood invested
'Til my cardiac's arrested and my 40 ounce is empty
Show me what you owe me and a porterhouse with that (Uh)
Black magic on the tires, only I
Roll-rollin' down a lonely mile, phony smile
Warrants, police on me now, still tourin'
And my chain, it may slow me down, cheer for it
Pain in its purest form
Don't complain, I came to reign from here forward
Still 'noid so crib got clear doors
Burnin' planes in my Air Force
And all I can see is Clearports (Uh)

[Chorus: Imogen Heap & A$AP Ferg]
Stop
Louder
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer (Uh)

[Verse 3: ASAP Ferg]
Since Rocky spit like André
I'm gon' kill 'em like Big Boi
These rappers is on my entrée
Eat 'em like cookies, Chips Ahoy
Mm, enjoy, when I get annoyed
Know a couple niggas that'll kill for joy
Either Gunplay, runway, trip avoid
Body get found by a little fishin' boy
Arnold Schwarzenegger, toss a nigga
Like codeine mixed with a 'roid
Slow punch make a nigga chin collide
Fuck talking, how fast you could grip a 9?
Damn, look at how the hollow tip hit his spine
Little motherfuckers that commit to crime
These niggas had the sidewalk sippin' wine
Guess that's why the ground sip the wine
Pouring liq' so I soak in lift and shine
Tip tipped and toe, I miss the sky
My soul gets cold when my niggas died
So and so, niggas live and die
Beneath shoe soles you will reside
Rappers get a mil' for these freakin' lies
Sign a couple deals for these freakin' lies
How many times in your eyes has a nigga died?
Never
Spittin' it like a Beretta, nobody do it better, nigga

[Intro: ASAP Rocky]
Uh, uh

[Verse 1: ASAP Rocky]
We use to wear rugged boots, now it's all tailored suits
Audemars Piguets for my criminal recruits
Champagne flutes, bumpin' rhythm and the blues
My partner made bad moves, he might end up in the news
Or end up in the tombs or living in the boondocks
Riding by the rules, I'll abide by it soon
See the situation we﻿ sophisticated goons
I know you live by the gun, then you die by it too
Niggas call me prophecy, swaggin' in philosophies
White on white wagon, call that motherfucker Socrates
Rat ass niggas, fighting for a block of cheese
Catch me out in China stunting, yeah, I'm about my guapanese
My shoe game serious, so serious, Wapanese
Niggas say I'm blessed, my bad I forgot to sneeze (Achoo)
There your reasons go, bitch
I got some tissues for your issues, tell 'em blow this
Bitch!

[Chorus: Santigold]
Make my money, walk straight ahead now
They countin' every day down, waitin' on me long
You know your way? Where you headin' now?
Me, I want everything (Bitch!) it won't take me long
Make my money, walk straight ahead now
They countin' every day down, waitin' on me long
You know your way? Where you headin' now?
Me, I want everything (Bitch!) it won't take me long

[Verse 2: ASAP Rocky]
Roger, Roger, tell 'em roger that (It will hit you on the head)
It’s the gold teeth, French braids, call me Project Pat (You don’t even gotta hate me now babe)
With the stocking cap, Jason mask on, probably strapped (Just as sheeps get led, ohh)
It’s the Rocky cat, turn my swag on, holla back (You could see where I'm going, ohh)
Throw a dollar at a bidd-itch, tell 'er suck my di-dick
Cause they hatin' on my clid-dick
Cause we made it when we did it, hate it cause they didn’t
My mama always told me keep your mind on your money
Boy you better pay attention
Ride with the pretty nigga, hoopty, no chauffeur
Paint lookin' like a drippin' smoothy, no coaster
The game's full of posers, big dog bulldozer
Pop up on 'em like toasters, wake 'em up like Folgers
Cuz Heaven need a villain like Hell need a newer idol
You could bet the crib and car, just renew the title
For now I’m po-pimpin' like them Do or Die dudes
Smoking killa but my doors still suicidal

[Chorus: Santigold]
Make my money, walk straight ahead now
They countin' every day down, waitin' on me long
You know your way? Where you headin' now?
Me, I want everything (Bitch!) it won't take me long
Make my money, walk straight ahead now
They countin' every day down, waitin' on me long
You know your way? Where you headin' now?
Me, I want everything (Bitch!) it won't take me long

[Bridge: Santigold]
It will hit you on the head
You don’t even gotta hate me now babe
Just as sheeps get led, ohh
You could see where I'm going, ohh
How you gonna feel now? You know what they say
Really you know that we don’t come how we get down
Everyone say "Rocky ahead"
They rollin', do what he said, no they can't get it wrong

[Chorus: Santigold]
Make my money, walk straight ahead now
They countin' every day down, waitin' on me long
You know your way? Where you headin' now?
Me, I want everything (Bitch!) it won't take me long
Make my money, walk straight ahead now
They countin' every day down, waitin' on me long
You know your way? Where you headin' now?
Me, I want everything (Bitch!) it won't take me long

[Verse 1]
Bitch motherfuckers trying to fake it trill
Sneak diss you just to make a bill
Now the world won't take you serious
When I met you, you was painting nails
Leave a motherfucker layin' still
B-bang him with the stainless steel
Cause I'm making the order
Laugh at the altar, pullin' a Lord up
Don't get someone sawed up
Your brain in a sawdust, niggas is washed up
I bang out in Florida
Shoot in Miami, goons out in Georgia
Been to New Orleans
But still a New Yorker, nigga the talk of
Town, nigga we bossed up
Bounce, but when you talk to the Lord
Of course, you're forced to
Bow down like a motherfuckin' peasant
Still that pretty motherfucker
And you know Harlem's what I'm reppin' nigga

[Chorus]
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my niggas
I’ll die for my niggas, man, fuck them other niggas!

[Interlude]
Lord, please talk to me Lord
I am here for you Lord

[Verse 2]
Gettin' faded, hair gettin' braided, Sophie sniffed a line of ye
Playin' spades, bumpin' Jimi Hendrix "Purple Haze"
A 40 to the face, call my homies from around the way
Give me that pussy, I'll be on my way
But grab the Jimmy so the bitch don't get no cash up out me
Pretty nigga, I'm a jiggy nigga, ask about me
Fuck niggas talkin' trash about me
But you know I toke a gauge, it can make any problem go away
Talkin' Jay, talkin' Ye, that mean you niggas talkin' cray
Razor blade across your face, I fix my face then walk away
I guess then there's nothin' more to say
Trill nigga to the death, whether Hell or the pearly gates
I think back to my early days
Whippin' and pinchin' that broad dough
It's a bit different now, switchin' and flippin' that raw flow
Substance get me higher, reefer and some fire
The devil is a liar, biased preachers shall retire
Jesus walked on water, I'm preachin' to the choir
Long live A$AP, now bow to your Messiah, bitch!

[Outro]
Let the Lords toast with the Lords
Toast to the Lords
When come gods, come Lords
Lords! Lords! Lords!
Oh, Lord! Toast to the Lords!
As we live this day, please pray for us
When comes the saints, comes the evils, brings the Lords

[Verse 1]
You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that "Baby, I'm right here" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy

[Verse 2]
Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

[Verse 3]
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
"He said he'd be here"

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing (Missing)
And that was the moment I knew

[Bridge]
What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

[Breakdown]
You should've been here
And I would've been so happy

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing
"Happy birthday to you"
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
You called me later
And said, "I'm sorry I didn't make it"
And I said, "I'm sorry, too"
And that was the moment I knew

[Verse 1]
You said it in a simple way
4 AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I told myself, don't get attached
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

[Chorus]
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

[Verse 2]
The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

[Chorus 2]
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

[Bridge]
This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York, be here
But you're in London, and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around

[Chorus]
This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

[Outro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I don't wanna miss you like this
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

[Intro]
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that

[Verse 1]
I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

[Pre-Chorus]
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception
This, I have previously learned

[Chorus]
So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

[Verse 2]
I just want to make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

[Pre-Chorus]
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it
If I hadn't once been just like her

[Chorus]
So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Call a cab, lose my number
You're about to lose your girl
Call a cab, lose my number
Let's consider this lesson learned

[Chorus]
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Want to see you pick up your phone
And tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

[Outro]
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
It would be a fine proposition
If I hadn't once been just like her

[Intro: Common]
Yo Troy I'mma come on the rhythm
With a little Commonism, yeah
Hah, so check it out, yeah

Word, from Com Sense
Untitled
Through the coolest nigga, what if's ballin' in my budget
Budgin' ain't in my ballin', nudgin' ain't in my nuggets, huh?
Too mean, too mean, no chicken in my luggage
But Michigan Ave jazz drum stick is in the bucket, huh?
Riveter
Proceed like abortion clinic picketer
Or don't heed a no seed deliverer
Or through the glass, face mask on the visitor
And to perform, get a little horn like a newborn unicorn
Listener
It's like miles on a horse
Five-thousand and two-hundred eighty styles for the source
Get compiled in reports then redacted into blackness
Then filed in the court for a trial for divorce, wow
We're like miles from the aisle they had walked
From the vows they had smiled now the child wanna forf
File is magnificent mile crowds watchin' the black male drummer pale
I was tellin' you before
Sail 'em to the shore just to sell 'em to be sure
Intelligent as hell when I tell it to the shore
Sell it to the shell you should come and buy a shirt
I be sellin' them on tour
Now there's somethin' to be said 'bout a trumpet to the head
A drummer for the hands, needs somethin' for the legs
Hmm, let's call it runaway slave ships
Fried chicken's tasteless and watermelon's racist nigga

[Intro]
Uh, pain
Uh, pain
Uh, pain
Uh

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
So big you are, shining like the star
With your head in the clouds 'til somebody shoot you down
Hands on the ground, back against the wall
Tell me who you call, when no one else around

[Chorus]
It was a lights, camera, act-, light, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action (You love, you love it)
Lights, camera, act-, light, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action (You love, you love it)
Lights, camera, act-, light, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action (You love, you love it)
Lights, camera, act-, light, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action (You love, you love it)

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
The future will be televised, haters getting genocide
23 and 43, I'm talking my Margiela size
My niggas is hella fly, you over accessorize
Dead alive, it’s in my repertoire, forever ever high
I never lie, never tell a lie, I would testify
Set aside dreams, I’m a king ask Coretta Scott
Cute faced, fat ass, and a nice set of thighs
Rihanna weave, I need a umbrella, ella, ella, ah

[Verse 2: Kent Jamz]
Everybody knows me, shit, still ain’t got no cash
Bitch, hit that flash quick, post my bad habits
Fuck you and your Instagram, match a gram, Mando
Royal blue Foams, getting head in the red Lambo
Media take me out, TMZ all in the V.I.P
Bitch I’m hard and my Loop Concrete
Too much Bossip if you ask me
Almost fucked fame, but she came with money
I got two bad bitches, haters wanna take 'em from me

[Chorus]
It was a lights, camera, act-, light, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action (you love, you love it)

[Verse 3: Tube]
Tryna get on in this industry, acting like you're (Ruthy)
Breaking down cocaine with the EBT (Oh yeah)
These male groupies doin' it however
Whatever they seein' on the box
Everybody spit, everybody hot
Everybody's an artist (Everybody not)
S-O L-O-S-T, niggas talking dollars, getting change
In a minute I'ma lose my cool, Sprewell one year before '98
Like fuck coach, I’m cutthroat, so what goes
Do you have for the year they say might be the end?
Better look within

[Verse 4: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, glitz and the glamors, we pose for the cameras
Ghetto niggas with me, they pose with the hammers
Ghetto girls with me, pink toes in the sandals
No dirty laundry, get your nose out my hamper
Clothes in my hamper, that Bathing Ape camouflage
Brands from Japan, you would think I was a samurai
Drop-crotch Jeremy Scott pants, bitch it’s Hammer time
Getting dirty money but I keep my hand sanitized
Li-life is what you need, won't you take a Z? Feel the breeze
Smoke the Sour Diese', hit that shit and please, act at ease
What you wanna be, like? The Black Eyed Peas, all these steezs
S-T-A-R-S, Hollywood, won’t you rest in peace?

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
So big you are, shining like the star
With your head in the clouds 'til somebody shoot you down
Hands on the ground, back against the wall
Tell me who you call, when no one else around

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yes, straight out the Ville and I'm blessed
Never met death, well, at least not yet
Off to the place where they rest under flowers
Niggas get wetter, like sex in the shower
Dear Lord, what am I here for?
Is it the hoes? Or the money? Or is there more?
I know the world is going to come to an ending
Before it does can finish up my sinning?
I see the devil grinning, as if he was winning
This is the bottom of the ninth inning
I'm coming back like light skinned
What a sad sight, looking at my gas light
Like "Damn man, I just threw 10 in"
Look five dollars won't get you what it use too
And look, love don't mean what it use too
And everybody and their mommas on youtube
Is it just me, or is this unusual?
Don't wanna loose ya', just wanna reach ya'll
So let me slow down, to the beat ya'll
Put the remote down, move your feet dawg
One time for the niggas holding heat ya'll
Keep that tucked, 'fore somebody get hurt
See me, I rather cut catch her body give birth
If you were the last nigga walking on earth
Turn yourself and clap your hands like this was church

[Hook: J. Cole]
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My nigga hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, homie do what you like
(Just, just) do what you like (Just, just) Hey!
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My baby hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, shawty do what you like

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I say money make the girls go down
They say money make the world go 'round
So my broke niggas, ain't it a shame
If Bill Gates made it rain
Then world goin' drown
Can I get a dollar?
Shawty got a low Impala
Made that ass drop, hydrola', holla!
Know she got a man, and I don't understand
Why he don't grab that bitch by the collar
Follow, look uh
I need my women a little hood
Living in a world where bad means good
That explains why the bad hoes attract 'em
That explains why the bad rappers go platinum
Or gold these days, go DJ
If the world stops spinning like a old DJ
Keep playing, I need a little more time
Pre paying, just a few more dimes
We slaying, keep praying, hoping
2012? You gotta be joking!
Ain't enough time and a nigga trynna' sign
But +The Whole World+ done lost they minds
Look, bombs over Baghdad, bullets in the Ville
This is not a test, this is not a drill
This is all real so before we all kill
Let me get one more feel. Baby!

[Hook]
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My nigga hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, homie do what you like
(Just, just) do what you like (Just, just) Hey!
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My baby hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, shawty do what you like

[Lil Cole]
Yeah, hey
Duck motherfuckers, run for your lives motherfucker
It's Lil Cole nigga. hahaha
The world is coming to an end nigga (It's coming to an end motherfucker, haha)
It's coming to an end trust me
I see it all revelation motherfuckers, all that shit
It's Lil Cole, you know I'm going in straight in to heaven nigga, holla at me

[Bridge x2]
Earthquakes and tsunamis and hurricanes
You meaner than Katrina baby I gotta know your name
Before this thing is over this might be the last song
For the man upstairs put the lights on and shut this party down

[Hook]
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My nigga hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, homie do what you like
(Just, just) do what you like (Just, just) Hey!
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My baby hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, shawty do what you like

[Verse 1]
Oh, I've never done this before
Never want to do this again
Wrong turn, on a dusty road
I did it to myself, I can't pretend
Well, I learned just a little too late
Good God, I must have been blind
'Cause she got me for everything
Everything, everything, alright
Like my daddy, I'm a gambling man
Never been afraid to roll the dice
But when I put my bet on her
Little Miss Snake Eyes ruined my life
She better sleep with one eye open
Better make sure to lock her doors
'Cause once I get my hands on her, I'ma ooh

[Chorus]
Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone
Well, I'm digging a ditch for this gold digging bitch
Watch out, she's quick
Look out for a pretty lil' thing named Natalie
If you see her, tell her I'm comin'
She better run

[Verse 2]
The good lord better bless your soul
'Cause I done already cursed your name
Don't matter which way you go
Payback's gonna come your way
You'll be begging me, "Please, please, please"
And I'ma look at you and laugh, laugh, laugh
While you sit there and cry for me, cry for me
Cry for me all night
I'll spend a life time in jail
(Yeah, that's what I'll do)
I'll be smiling in my cell
(Yeah, thinking 'bout you)
Can't nobody save you now
Sure, there ain't no use in trying
Once I get my hands on you, I'ma ooh

[Chorus]
Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling every one
Well, I'm digging a ditch for this gold digging bitch
Watch out, she's quick
Look out for a pretty lil' thing named Natalie
If you see her, tell her I'm comin'
She better run

[Bridge]
I should've known better
(I should've known better)
'Cause when we were together
('Cause when we were together)
She never said forever
(She never said forever)
I'm a fool that played in her game, hey!

[Chorus]
Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling every one
Well, I'm digging a ditch for this gold digging bitch
Watch out, she's quick
Look out for a pretty lil' thing named Natalie
If you see her, tell her I'm comin'
She better run
In lak'ech planetary kin
Red overtone dragon make your barathary spin
In the flesh with a band of merry men
Innocent civilians hari kari over yen
Is it the end or for pretend?
I can neither condemn, nor defend
Cats, that's more pussy than a sanitary napkin bin
Villain ran a scam on his imaginary rapping friend
Again, shame on us
We in the same game, put the blame on Gus
Study til your brain vomit
Just don't be out getting money when it rain comets
Armpits of funk, a bomb in the hunk a junk trunk
Metal palm on your ma's badunkadunk
In a park in a rave under three days of darkness
Tell a hater behave and spark this
With the fresh banana berry blend
Counting mad tens 'til when January begin
The other hand clutched to a pen, 24/7 much to his chagrin
Used to drink gin, now he only drink oxygen water
Mixed with shark fins that cleanse the toxins sorta
And if they ever come get me
We were sippin rum on a number one jitney
I can neither confirm nor deny
On account of the sherm all high
Villain make 'em squirm 'til her perm all dry
Sperm to her eye, to a worm to a fly
It's germs, and mad babies to kiss
Won't stop rockin except to maybe take a piss
Or soak his feet in a mineral oil vat
Holding a Rodin coil in his tin foil hat
Step aside, give him some room playa
Til the end of days he'll be the ill doomsayer (slayer)

[Intro]
Yeah, oh, mu

(J-J-J-J-J.R.)

[Verse 1]
Like a shock to my heart
When I saw you tonight
Like a dream come alive
For the very first time
When we touch in the dark
Baby, you're blowing my mind
Wish I could freeze you and me
In this moment in time (hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
You got it, what I want
Give it up, shorty
Step it up for me
And I'll give you everything
All my life, all my love
I'll give you my fortune and fame
I'd even give you my name

[Chorus]
Girl, you take me higher
Than I've ever been before, my feet don't touch the floor
We'll fly, the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
Girl, you take me up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up
Girl, you take me up
You take me higher, the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit

[Verse 2]
When we dance when we kiss
Doesn't get any better than this
How you shine, trapped in the spotlight
Finally mine, yeah
Baby, let's go (go), let's get out of here
Baby, let go (go), got nothing to fear
And now that we're here, let's disappear
Into the night (hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
You got it, what I want (what I want)
Give it up, shorty (shorty)
Step it up for me
And I'll give you everything
All my life, all my love
I'll give you my fortune and fame
I'd even give you my name

[Chorus]
Girl, you take me higher
Than I've ever been before, my feet don't touch the floor
We'll fly, the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
Girl, you take me up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up
Girl, you take me up
You take me higher, the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit

[Bridge]
My feet are on the ceiling, haha (the ceiling)
And they don't wanna touch the ground anymore
Oh, what I feel (what I feel), I can feel it (I can feel it)
Can you feel it? Feel It, feel it (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Girl, you take me higher (oh, yeah)
Than I've ever been before (before), my feet don't touch the floor
We'll fly, the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
Girl, you take me up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up (you take me up, baby)
Girl, you take me up (oh whoa, oh)
You take me higher, the sky is the limit (higher)
The sky is the limit, oh, whoa

[Intro]
What if?
What if I'm the one for you?
And you're the one for me?
What if

[Verse 1]
If you are the one
Then us meeting here is fate, uh
Future with a dog named Red
Buy a house with a fireplace
This is the first I've seen your face
But there's a chance we are soulmates
I know that this might sound crazy
'Cause you don't know my name

[Chorus]
But we can't, we can't tell the future, no
But that's just, the beauty of the world we know
So I'ma say doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo
Baby, what if
We all can say doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo
Baby, what if
What if (what if)
What if (what if)
What if (what if)
What if

[Verse 2]
Yeah, picture me on one knee
With the perfect diamond ring (perfect diamond ring)
We just met, but if you say, "Yes"
We'd have our wedding on the beach (oh)
It could happen, raise three kids
And we grow old, oh, so happily
I know this might sound crazy
'Cause I don't know your name

[Chorus]
But we can't (we can't), we can't tell the future, no
But that's just, the beauty of the world we know
So I'ma say doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo
Baby, what if
We all can say doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo
Baby, what if

[Bridge]
Don't know what tomorrow brings but I'm still hoping
That you are the one for me
Oh and what if I had you and what if you had me and
Baby, what's the reason we can't fall in love?
What if
What if
What if, oh, woah

[Chorus]
But we can't, we can't tell the future, no
But that's just, the beauty of the world we know
So I'ma say doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo
Baby, what if
We all can say doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo (yeah)
Baby, what if
But we can't (we can't), we can't (ooh) tell the future, no
But that's just, the beauty of the world we know
So I'ma say doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo (singing oh)
Baby, what if
We all can say doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo
Baby, what if

[Verse 1]
Uh, I met her at a bar (bar, bar, bar)
The look she gave me said I wouldn't get far (hey)
But that ain't never stop me (me, me, me)
See I like a challenge so I proceeded to speak (hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
One drink turned into two drinks (two drinks)
Three drinks turned into dancing (dancing)
And pretty soon her body was all up on me (on me)
When I woke up I saw her laying next to me

[Chorus]
It was just a fling
But I really don't regret a thing
'Cause it was crazy, babe
And by the looks of it, you feel the same
And all I remember is me saying (oh, oh)
Give it to me then you gave it (oh, oh)
Now I'm smiling and I'm barely sober (oh)
I'm caught in a love hangover (hey)
Love hangover (hey)
Love hangover

[Verse 2]
Don't you worry, it's fine (fine, fine, fine)
See this will be our little dirty secret for life (hey)
'Cause your man will lose his mind (mind, mind, mind)
If he ever found out last night, that

[Pre-Chorus]
One drink turned into two drinks (two drinks)
Three drinks turned into dancing (dancing)
And pretty soon her body was all up on me (on me)
When I woke up I saw her laying next to me

[Chorus]
It was just a fling
But I really don't regret a thing
'Cause it was crazy, babe
And by the looks of it, you feel the same (hey)
And all I remember is me saying (oh, oh)
Give it to me then you gave it (oh, oh)
Now I'm smiling and I'm barely sober (oh)
I'm caught in a love hangover

[Bridge]
Now I didn't know (I didn't know)
How far it'll go, oh
But I said I would have her (I said I would have her)
Now it's the morning after

[Chorus]
It was just a fling
But I really don't regret a thing
'Cause it was crazy, babe (crazy, babe)
And by the looks of it, you feel the same (you feel the same)
And all I remember is me saying (I remember, me saying)
Give it to me then you gave it (yeah, yeah)

Love hangover

[Intro]
I'm giving up, yeah
I'm giving up, yeah
I'm giving up searching, searching, searching to find
Finally found the one, it's you

[Chorus]
It turns me on when I wake up, you're wearing my shirt, no makeup
You're singing real loud when we make love, woo, ooh, ooh
The only one I tell all my problems, one smile, no words, you solve 'em
Oh, how your body sings, woo, ooh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter, what you say, you always sound sexy to me
That's when you know, oh, oh, you know, oh, oh

Oh, nothing (oh, nothing)
Nothing else matters to me
Oh, no one (oh, no one)
No one makes me feel this way

Yeah, I love it when you wanna put my chain on, playing in bed, throw the game on
Not watching for long, here's the same song, woo, ooh, ooh
Ooh, how you whisper, you got me, then you kiss every inch of my body
You're touching every tattoo, like woo, ooh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter, what you say, you always sound sexy to me
That's when you know, oh, oh, you know, oh, oh
When your skin touches mine, I just wanna love you, all night

Tell the world you're mine
Like, like, woo, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Oh, nothing (oh, nothing)
Nothing else matters to me

[Hook - Victoria Monet ]

I'm on the road the day I die
That unchangeable surprise
No waking up but don't you cry
Let your dreams live on tonight
Uuuuh Uuuuh
Uuuuh Uuuuh
Uuuuh Uuuuh
Live on tonight

[Bridge - T.I]

Yea
Yea
Hustle Gang nigga!
Aye
Leggo!

[Verse I - T.I ]
We do it big, going hard, get it in
I tell them make my hustle for fitting in
I'll catch a fed case, go to prison then
Turn around, do the same shit again
Down back, countin' rack
A hundred kilo champagne, hey I drown that
Loud pack, burnt up
Do the iMAX bid, shorty turnt up
The American dream, I'm livin' in it
To Trayvon get some Jesses, I kill a bitch every minute
Real talk, give a damn about the sentence
If you ain't down to die for something
Your life ain't worth living

[Hook ]

I'm on the road the day I die
That unchangeable surprise
No waking up but don't you cry
Let your dreams live on tonight
Uuuuh Uuuuh
Uuuuh Uuuuh
Uuuuh Uuuuh
Live on tonight

[Bridge]

Yea
That right
Family Hustle nigga

[Verse 2 - T.I ]
I'm livin' so my sons and daughters never see martyr
Get it, spend it today, save something tomorrow
A young king's Arthur, learned from my father
Tomorrow 50-50, today is our hour
Damn right, 24 hours, 365 day
Push it to the limit, switchin' lanes on the highway
Like fuck it, if I die today I die paid
I'm straight nigga, straight bullets in your driveway
Man the game, man the game, why should I play?
For my fam, my life, damn alley
Put it on the line, never mind the consequences
If you ain't down to die for something your life ain't worth living

[Hook:]
I'm on the road the day I die
That unchangeable surprise
No waking up but don't you cry
Let your dreams live on tonight

Uuuuh Uuuuh
Uuuuh Uuuuh
Uuuuh Uuuuh
Live on tonight

[Bridge]

Ahuh
I ain't finish, leggo

[Verse III - T.I ]

You know a trouble man ride with a hundred band
Bet it all, win or lose, it ain't nothing man
Modern day, near perfect, I'm the son of man
Every summer kill shit, call me Son of Sam
Big chain, big car
I could buy a big house on my black card
Them other suckers only wanna act hard
Hustle Gang, we jump off, flow stunt hard
So respected, I don't even need a bodyguard
But if it fully automatic then it probably hours
Real talk, give a fuck about the sentence
If you ain't down to die for something your life ain't worth living

[Hook:]
I'm on the road the day I die
That unchangeable surprise
No waking up but don't you cry
Let your dreams live on tonight

Uuuuh Uuuuh
Uuuuh Uuuuh
Uuuuh Uuuuh
Live on tonight

Cold heart, warm dick, momma, we be polar

And ate space cakes that was filled with bud
And now 2012, nigga, look at these Scuds
Green hair, money on my mind, hip-hop grunge
You wear a cross, I wear a Cartier nail
You niggas ain't fuckin' with Ph'rell
My wrist sizzle hot like it's stuck in the chair

Haha, my lil' drop top girl

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uh, sweet lil' somethin', turbo button
458, engine runnin'
LA so sunny, I'm so Young Money
And that base in the trunk got this bitch bumpin'
That's my shit, don't skip nothin'
Play it loud 'til the top of the world for me
I fear nothin', ride 'til the cops comin'
Colored coupe seats, honey
I went from rags to a wrist, glitter, it cost six
Rooms in the crib, okay, I did
Walk your ass right in, girl, leave in a minute
Ever had sex on the sand?
I guarantee this will be the ride of your life
'Round the world, do it all in one night
Most them girls, I play 'em and never wife
But it's somethin' about you that I like (That I like)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, Chris Brown & Tyga]
Girl, I really love the way you look at me
Ain't no other feeling that can drive me crazy

We can be in my drop top, girl, it's only me and you tonight
Take it off

We can be in my drop top, girl, it's only me and you tonight
Take it off
Through the coolest nigga
“What if’s”, ballin’ in my budget
Budgin’ ain’t in my ballin’
Nudgin’ ain’t in my nuggets (haaahhhh)
Too mean, too mean, no chicken in my luggage
But Michigan Ave. jazz drumstick is in the bucket (haaaahhhh, haahhh)
Riveter
Proceed like abortion clinic picketer
Or don’t heed a no-seed deliverer
Or through-the-glass face-mask on the visitor
And to perform get a lil’ horn like a newborn unicorn
Listener!
It’s like miles on a horse
5,280 styles for the source
Get compiled in reports
Then redacted into blackness
Then filed in the court for a trial for divorce!
Wow!
We’re like miles from the aisle they had walked
From the vows they had smiled now the child wanna fourth
Foul as magnificent black mall crowds
Watchin’ the black male drummer pail I was tellin’ you before
Sail ‘em to the shore just to sell ‘em to be sure
Intelligent as hell when I tell it to the sure
Sell it to the Shell you should come and buy a shirt
I be sellin’ them on tour (tour, tour, tour)
Now there’s something to be said about a trumpet to the head
A drummer for the hands needs somethin’ for the legs
Hmm… Let’s call it runaway slaveships
Fried chickens tasteless
And watermelons racist
Nigga!
Wiseman closes mouth
Madman closes fist
Young man shows his age
Judge man named it sin
Bad man don' exist no
No evil man exists
Good man don't exist no
No righteous man exists
Sad man cannot cry in place where man can see
Never witnessed father weep
This old man thought it weak
But strong man don't exist
No undying man exists
Weak man don't exist no
Just flesh and blood exists
But your mother would be proud of you
I bet your mother would be proud of you

The beast will crawl this earth
Then fall in the dirt to feed the crows
They'll rip apart his flesh
Til all that's left is glorious bone
So you'll bury your own
Too vain
You saw it unfold
What you know
And you claimed all you could hold
Until death did you part from the mess you made
I bet your mother would be proud of you
I bet your mother would be proud of you
Primate sharpens tool
To survive and thrive in the jungle
Maybe hearts were made to pump blood
Maybe lungs were made for flood
I won't blunt my blade for cut these chains
Rather let my limbs be drug through mud
You're my brother but your eyes are cold
You're my sister but your womb is bare

I bet our mother would be proud of you
I bet our mother would be proud of you

Bad man don't exist
No evil man exists
I know good man don't exist
No righteous man exists
Strong man don't exist
No undying man exists
Weak man don't exist
No just flesh and blood exists

[Intro]
Uh, Queens man
Here we are
2013 and beyond
Fuck all the talking

[Verse 1]
Yo, I rock the AIDS walk hat, Smoke a baseball bat
Get paid off rap, I copped an 8 all black
Hop out Laredo's, Equipped with the potato strap
Get turned to home fries, That's by any means to see the dough rise
Ill! This bitch's pussy smell like low tide
No pride, Fuck it I'll just hold my breath
Suplex a fiend at the Sizzler
Damn shorty got a shitter
Me and my father hit it back to back like Griffey
Big black girl bad fake missy
You could catch me in a line for my SS
I need some red sweats and a box of reds
I make the consommé from the lobster head
Now a days I'm getting lots of head
Uh, 635's drop with the aqua treads
10 stacks for a dap, 20 just to look me in the eye
Body'll shoot you in the thigh
Flip outta the whip, dip, I'm out
Change it up man

[Verse 2]
We outta here with this one
Uh, Aw man
This is that, that beautiful shit right here
I choose you, you fucking ho
Yo tilt the goblet, Staring in the middle of the cockpit
Spanish bitch displayed up in some ostrich
Quinceañera freak dancing
Grant Hill's laced up with the x Helly Hansen
Foggy night hustle til' the sun up
Stumbling anonymous
Fuck around find your leg by the Gowanus Bridge
Over do it send your penis to your mama' crib
That's what happens when you open your vagina lips
Only focus on the merges and acquisitions
Commas on accounts, robbin' 'em like Yount
Boy you don't want no probelums, I got the opera lungs
Andrea Bocelli, Hit the telly, Lift my belly
Called off the ?
Baby there's no mistakin' my life is etched in granite, Sophisticated palate
Sweet, sour, salty, spicy, and umami
I'm eating oysters off of diamonds in Hawaii with 3 dykes that play ball for the Liberty
Finished the sequel now I'm lighting up the trilogy
Like E-Honda when he's smashing up the Lexus
Luger arms, baby it's all about accoutrements
Queens shit, That's how we fucking do in London, Tim Westwood
Bam Bam Bronsolinio we out here!
Uh!
Wise man closed his mouth
Mad man closed his fist
Young man shows his age
Judged man named it sin
Bad man don't exist, no

[Intro: Curren$y]
Uh, jets, nigga, now where haven't we?
Taylor Gang, stay rollin' up them paper planes
Yeah, yeah, jets, nigga, now where haven't we?
And I'm tryin' to get Grease to smoke joints, man
Tryin' to convert him to EZ Widers or Zig-Zags
Before I get back to New Orleans
Uh, how fly, yeah (How fly), yeah

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Uh, same nigga that I always been
Mets hat with green under the brim
I shop in bulk, my closet a vault
Gettin' dressed, sippin' Rose' & OJ, light pulp
Lookin' like myself in my old Easter photos
Socks and my rugby is Polo
Stop, freeze, on three's my low low
Airplanes, dollar signs on tees, my logo
Kush smokin' circles in my dojo
Sneaker collector, I bring 'em out, kid
Kicks all over the crib, roundhouses
Uh, fuck you talkin' ‘bout, Willis?
Yo’ bitch fuckin' wit’ Spitta 'cause she like her stroke different
Celebrate the moments of your life
We party all night (Uh), smoke all day (Yeah)
Breakfast in the airport, get drunk the whole flight, yeah

[Chorus: Curren$y & Wiz Khalifa]
This is how we do (How we do)
Everyday chase money, make bitches chase you (Chase you)
Nigga, this is how we do (How we do)
Race to the club, hop out and valet the coupes (Valet the coupes)
Nigga, this is how we do (How we do)
Under the shade of the good trees, we stay cool (Stay cool)
Yeah, yeah, and if the bitch can't roll weed (Uh)
No need to bring her through (Uh)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I had a dream that I was smokin' California weed
And brother, I tell her give me what I need
Pull up in car service, flyin' private when I leave
I'm chillin', two pretty women who speakin' Japanese, nigga, please
I'm sellin' out concerts, some 501 pants that sag
Zig-Zags and my Converse
Spitta to my left, let him hit the bong first
Lame nigga asked if he get a hit
Little do he know that's a guaranteed way to get skipped
I find beautiful women and politic
Wakin' up, still drunk, feelin' sick
I'ma smoke one with you, roll another one for the whip
Listenin' to my brand new shit
My doors suicide, though my trees big chop provided
Fly society, and Taylor Gang or get hanged
Smokin' weed with your bitches when she told you she would never do it again

[Chorus: Curren$y & Wiz Khalifa]
This is how we do (How we do, haha, yeah)
Everyday chase money, make bitches chase you (Chase you)
Nigga, this is how we do (How we do)
Race to the club, hop out and valet the coupes (Valet the coupes)
Nigga, this is how we do (How we do)
Under the shade of the good trees, we stay cool (Stay cool)
Yeah, yeah, and if the bitch can't roll weed
No need to bring her through

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah
It's Young Khalifa man, Curren$y the Hot Spitta
Look in the mirror man, ask yourself one thing
How Fly, yeah

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Foot on the gas, I'm fast living, picture me
I ain't have no pot to piss in now I'm checking bags
Chief and hash with politicans, helicopter pads
Some hoes to get to know and hella Zags, no tags
I ain't one to brag, but if you ain't trying to hear
About the money drugs and women then I ain't one to ask
Smoke so much that I'm going brain dead
Hoes mad at me cause my phone's off until my plane land
I tell her whoa, slow down baby
And Spitta with me, it's enough to go round lady
You drive by, I give her wings Redbull and Jim buckets
A couple of paper planes
Broadcasting my name over Internet airwaves
Bitches hear me on Twitter put my music on there Myspace pages
If you smoke then roll up and play this
Me and Hot Spitta come where the planes is

[Chorus: Curren$y]
She said she wants to sip Clicquot on my living room floor
Smoke weed hang with other famous people I know
Gain access to exculsive places I go
Lavish and dangerous, this the life I chose
But I wouldn't change it for nothing
Sex, money and drugs, runways, sports cars, and luggage
Better to be somebody for one day
Then to be a nobody for your whole life so fuck it

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Yeah get the cork out the bottles
Put the purp in the easy wider
Spitta in the house, hide your lighters, I take 'em
A case of mistaken identity
My bad fool I could of swore I brought this one in with me
In the cinnamon interior
Not tinted early 80's box Chevy with a Crate engine
Hijacking your women, you left her unattended
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Fly when I'm on that liqour
The way of the samauri, I got my chi centered
Sharp as blades, these bars I lay
Forever the player and never played
I slay them bitches I never save
Bomb ass trees they get blazed
Palm trees we use them for the shade
What else can I say I got it made
Like I had it built, Taylor Gang or get killed, yeah

[Chorus: Redfoo]
We came here to party (Rock)
We didn't come here to fight
I say, we grab ourselves a bottle
And toast to the good life

[Verse 1: Sky Blu]
Just cause a guy got a suit and a tie don't mean he gonna tax ya
Just cause I walk with a limp like an old school pimp don't mean I'll slap ya
But if you wanna talk tough, and you wanna puff up, then I might just have to
But I ain't come here to clock your mouth, (no!) I came here to rock the house (ho!)
Yeah, I get crazy wild, anything for the fans to make them smile
Goose and girls, that's my style, if you think I'm a thug, then you in denile
But you know when push come to shove, we protect ourselves and the ones we love
Stay at home, sit and judge, or celebrate life and hit the club

[Pre-Chorus: GoonRock]
Everybody just wants to feel good
From up on Capitol Hill to the hood
Often times we get misunderstood
But tonight's our night

[Chorus: Redfoo]
We came here to party (Rock)
We didn't come here to fight
I say, we grab ourselves a bottle
And toast to the good life

[Verse 2: Redfoo]
They call you suit and tie, you's a politician
They call me super-fly, I'm always with two bitches
You go to church ties, I grew up with them scriptures
You on your P's and Q's, I'm sippin' Jeezy Juice
We both get a lot of attention in the press
You sellin' books and wanna be the President
We sellin' hooks, and the flow is heaven sent
We both hustlin', so why we tusslin'?

[Pre-Chorus: GoonRock]
Everybody just wants to feel good
From up on Capitol Hill to the hood
Often times we get misunderstood
But tonight's our night

[Chorus: Redfoo]
We came here to party (Rock)
We didn't come here to fight
I say, we grab ourselves a bottle
And toast to the good life
We came here to party (Rock)
We didn't come here to fight
I say, we grab ourselves a bottle
And toast to the good life

[Break]
I came here to rock the house
I came here to rock the house
I came here to rock the house
I came here to rock the house
I came here to rock the house
I came here to rock the house
I came here to rock the house
I came here to rock the house
Rock, r-rock, rock the house
Rock, r-rock, rock the house
Rock, r-rock, rock the house
G-g-get, get, get wild
Rock, r-rock, rock the house
Rock, r-rock, rock the house
Rock, r-rock, rock the house
Rock, r-rock, rock - get crazy
Get, g-get, get, g-get, get crazy
Get, g-get, get, g-get, get wild
Get, g-get, get, g-get, get crazy
Get, g-get, get, g-get, get wild

[Chorus: Redfoo]
We came here to party (Rock)
We didn't come here to fight
I say, we grab ourselves a bottle
And toast to the good life

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Heifer whines could be human cries
Closer comes the screaming knife
This beautiful creature must die
This beautiful creature must die
A death for no reason
And death for no reason is murder
And the flesh you so fancifully fry
Is not succulent, tasty or kind
It's death for no reason
And death for no reason is murder
And the calf that you carve with a smile
It is murder
And the turkey you festively slice
It is murder
Do you know how animals die?

[Verse 2]
Kitchen aromas aren't very homely
It's not comforting, cheery or kind
It's sizzling blood and the unholy stench of murder
It's not natural, normal or kind
The flesh you so fancifully fry
The meat in your mouth
As you savour the flavour of murder
No, no, no, it is murder
No, no, no, it is murder
Oh... and who hears when animals cry?

[Outro]

[Intro]
Hey, hey
And it feels so good...
Don't you feel so good?
Talk to me...

[Verse 1]
Hey, I never been this good, not ever, not ever
Never seen this part of me
I know nothing last forever, however

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not worried about tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow may not come
And where my heart takes me I follow, you gotta follow

[Chorus]
When they lay me down, put my soul to rest
When they ask me how I spent my life
At least I got to love ya
When it's all over, when it's all said and done
When it's all over, at least I got to love ya
At least I got to love ya

[Verse 2]
Hey, ask for I wanna leave
Life on legacy, me loving you, and you loving me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not worried about tomorrow, tomorrow
All I know, all the time we have is borrowed, I feel no sorrow

[Chorus]
When they lay me down, put my soul to rest
When they ask me how I spent my life
At least I got to love ya
When it's all over, when it's all said and done
When it's all over, at least I got to love ya
At least I got to love ya

[Bridge]
Everybody say... hey hey hey hey
I got nothing else
Oh, I do nothing else
At least I got to love ya
At least I got to love ya, tell 'em, baby
If I do nothing else, gotta do nothing else
At least I got to love you
At least I got to love you
Everybody say... hey hey hey hey
Everybody say... hey hey hey hey

[Outro]
Say mommy, say I love you
Papa, you ready?
Can you say a, how about a a
Ooh boy, what's your name, Showtime
But whats your name?... Egypt

[Verse 1]
He says, have no fear
Open up, let me in
He says, take a chance
Here's your song, time to dance

[Pre-Chorus]
What you gonna do, when it comes for you?

[Chorus]
Listen to your heart
You gotta listen, to your heart
Listen to your heart
Why don't you listen to your heart?

[Verse 2]
He says, here's your sky, don't look down
We can fly
You say, you little be scared
Just hold on, almost there

[Pre-Chorus]
What you gonna do, when it comes for you?

[Chorus]
Listen to your heart
You gotta listen, to your heart
Listen to your heart
Why don't you listen to your heart?

[Bridge]
You never know until you try
Why so scared, when hearts don't lie
Turn off the world, and close your eyes
Lose yourself, and...

[Chorus]
Listen to your heart
You gotta listen, to your heart
Listen to your heart
Why don't you listen to your heart?

[Post-Chorus]
You know what to do when it comes for you

[Outro]
You gotta listen, baby
Gotta listen baby, gotta listen, baby
Gotta listen to it
How can you hear it?
Gotta listen, baby
Mmm

[Verse 1]
You left me hanging from the thread
We once swung from together
I lick my wounds
But I can never see them getting better
Something's gotta change
Things cannot stay the same
Her hair was pressed against her face
Her eyes were red with anger
Enraged by things unsaid
And empty beds and bad behavior

[Pre-Chorus]
Something's gotta change
It must be rearranged
Oh

[Chorus]
I'm sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out alright, yeah
Whoa, whoa, oh

[Verse 2]
The room was silent as we all tried so hard to remember
The way it feels to be alive
The day that he first met her
Something’s gotta change
Things cannot stay the same
You make me think of someone wonderful
But I can't place her
I wake up every morning
Wishing one more time to face her

[Pre-Chorus]
Something's gotta change
It must be rearranged
Oh

[Chorus]
I'm sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out alright

[Bridge]
So much to love, so much to learn
But I won't be there to teach you, oh
I know I can't be close
But I'll try my best to reach you

[Chorus]
I'm so sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
Cannot carry the weight of the heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out alright, yeah
Whoa, whoa, oh, yeah

[Intro: Timbaland]
Uh, feel me
To all the women across the world, we can't diss y'all
We gotta love ya, that's real, uh

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
To all my ladies in lingerie
Never underage, who stay gettin paid
Who like to take trips where the sun is shade
To my women who love to ball out
And spend all that money 'til ya fall out
I feel like a pimp with a different pimp game
With a different pimp name, with a little pimp fame
I'm loaded with cash, loaded with class, loaded with a lot of things
Even got a gat loaded for that ass
I love my mind, love my soul, love my body
I don't drink or smoke that's why I love my body
You might catch me chillin with a little short hottie
With a little piercin on her body
Yes, I get it poppin, 'specially overseas
Japenese girls even love my beats
They say, "Timbaland we love you
We love the dope things that you do"
Even in London they say, "Tim, we love ya"
They even call me things like wicked, and the f'n gov'na
That's why I can't forget y'all
That's why I had to make this roll call, uh

[Hook - Tweet]
This here's for one and all
It's so good to feel all a y'all, oooh
Make that move and just ball out, oooh
Life's too short for some time out, oooh
This here's for one and all
It's so good to feel all a y'all, oooh
Make that move and just ball out, oooh
Life's too short for some time out, oooh

[Verse 2: Sebastian]
Back when shorty cherished the thing
Yo' time was frequently saved
For us stoppin and whiskey popping to the Marvin and Gaye
Sonny, don't plan tomorrow but live for today
Sonny, here's a quarter for that groovy arcade
From Cool J to Kane dawg, we changin the game
So graphic with things
Pac-Man ain't looking the same
Haters, get more familiar who you robbing for change
Sebast', a.k.a. Tyler Durden's the name

[Timbaland]
Guess what people
It's the first of the month
Guess what people, I can do what I want
I can take, all my peoples on first class flights
I can buy all my homegirls lightning new bikes
I'm a don when it comes to just servin girls
I'm a don so that's why nobody's in my world
Cause Timabaland's that cool cat
Aka Thomas Crown, don't forget that, uh

[Hook]

[Tweet]
I'm just tryna find what I need
But I'd rather be smokin weed

[Magoo]
Live life to the fullest, drive cars, eat hot food
Live in a mansion next to Hanson

[Tweet]

I'm just tryna' be who you would

[Magoo]
Cause I hate the game, I hate the glory
I could be with y'all
It would be another story

[Tweet]
You don't know all the things I seen
More than fame and his naked greed

[Magoo]
They took my cash, take my name
Put it up in bright lights
I ain't got a damn right

[Tweet]
Think I'm chilling and living large
Girl he's Mag not El DeBarge

All my P-Town folk getting paid, bottom line

Frustrated 'cause he wanna stay too long?
I'm missing you calling on the bat phone
Tryna see what tonight gon' hear for
When you with him do, sometimes kinda wish that it was us
Posted up in the kitchen, you teaching me how to cook
Then it pop off on the counter and we make a lot of fuss
Then I take over the teaching and you know what I'll do first

[Chorus]

Down to wet your set up
Pussies better vest up
Mustard colored stones, but my donk look like ketchup
Mustard colored stones, but my donk look like ketchup
Mustard colored stones, but my donk look like ketchup
Mustard colored stones, but my donk look like ketchup

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I take my hoes to islands, so they call me Gilligan
A gangster but a gentleman, seldom wearing Timberlands
Chameleon, Brazilian, Amphibian, Reptilians
Order fettuccine cuz I'm dining with Sicilians
Lobster tail, shrimp scampi, and calamari
Jumping out Ferraris with the ...(?)
I'm selling birds dirty, plus the mids sell good
$1500 so your girl can say I smell good
Scented candles, incense burning when I take a shower
I'd rather rot in prison before I go out like a coward
I top 3 G's, he make $10 an hour
I ain't hatin' shawty, but know you can do without him
Manicured nails, I keep pedicured feet
Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant couldn't swag like me
Bet you Tiger Woods can't pull the hoes that I've pulled
Give me two blue dolphins and a couple Red Bulls

[Verse 2: La Chat]
(?)

[Verse 1]
Ooh, I got a body full of liquor
With a cocaine kicker
And I'm feeling like I'm thirty feet tall
So lay it down, lay it down
You got your legs up in the sky
With the devil in your eyes
Let me hear you say you want it all
Say it now, say it now

[Pre-Chorus]
Look what you're doing, look what you've done
But in this jungle, you can't run
'Cause what I got for you, I promise it's a killa
You'll be banging on my chest, bang bang, gorilla

[Chorus]
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I got a fistful of your hair
But you don't look like you're scared
You just smiling, tell me "Daddy, it's yours"
'Cause you know how I like it, you's a dirty little lover
If the neighbors call the cops, call the sheriff, call the SWAT
We don't stop, we keep rocking while they knocking on our door
And you're screaming, "Give it to me baby
Give it to me, motherfucker!"

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, look what you're doing, look what you've done
But in this jungle you can't run
'Cause what I got for you, I promise it's a killa
You'll be banging on my chest, bang bang, gorilla

[Chorus]
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas

[Bridge]
I bet you never ever felt so good, so good
I got your body trembling like it should, it should
You'll never be the same, baby, once I'm done with
Yoo-oo-oo-oo-oou, yeah

[Breakdown]
You, you, you...

[Chorus]
Oh, you with me, baby, making love like gorillas
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Yeah, you and me, baby, we'll be fucking like gorillas
(Oh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby, baby, aw, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas

[Live Verse]
Girl, let me take my time, take my time, take my time, babe
I just want one smile, want one smile, want one smile, babe
Once I lay besides you, girl, I will make you scream, "yeah, yeah"
Girl, let me take my time, take my time, take my time, babe
I just want one smile, want one smile, want one smile, babe
Once I get inside you, girl, I will make you scream, "yeah, yeah, yeah"
Come on (etc.)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Intro]
"N...E...R...D...
This..is... *In...Search...Of...*"

[Pharrell Williams]
Hey
It's me, your subconscious speaking
Turn me up yo
Close your eyes
Now that I got you under my concentration
Let's pledge allegience
We are the rare
We are the strong
We are the meek
We're just not humble about it
We've been here since the beginning of time
And all products of the world in which we live in
Are products of our imagination
We are the dreamers
And as long as we dream, we will never die
You know why?
Cause no one ever really dies

[Outro]
Hey, baby
Me, Chad, and Shae
We want to squeeze you titties
Mmm

[Verse 1]
Lady, where has your love gone?
I was looking but can't find it anywhere
They always offer when there's loads of love around
But when you're short of some, it's nowhere to be found
Well, I know your game, you told him yesterday
"No chance, you'll get nothing from me"
But now she's there, you're there and everybody's there
He's in turmoil, as puzzled as can be, just like me

[Chorus]
Let's go down, down, low down
Where I know I should not go
Oh, and she, you think she's the one
But she's just one in twenty-four
And just 'cause everybody's doing it
Does that mean that I can too?

[Verse 2]
Lady, where has your love gone?
It was the antiseptic to the sore
To hold you by the hand
Must you first be in demand?
How he longs for you to long for him once more
Just once more

[Chorus]
Let's go down, down, low down
Where I know I should not go
Oh, and she, you think she's the one
But she's just one in twenty-four
And just 'cause everybody's doing it
Does that mean that I can too?

[Bridge]
Oh, her eyes went down and cut you up
And there's nothing like a dirty look from
The one you want or the one you've lost

[Verse 3]
An ache in your soul, it's everybody's goal
To get what they can't have
That's why you're after her and that's why she's after him
But saying it won't change a thing

[Outro]
And they'll realise that it won't change a thing
Realise that it won't change a thing

[Chorus]
Free like the river
Flowing freely through infinity
Free to be sure of
What I am and who I need not be
Free from all worries
Worries prey on oneself's troubled mind
Freer than the clock's hands
Tickin' way the times
Freer than the meaning of free that man defines
Life running through me
Till I feel my father God has called

[Verse]
Me having nothin'
But possessing riches more than all
And I'm free
To be nowhere
But in every place I need to be
Freer than a sunbeam
Shining through my soul
Free from feelin' heat or knowing bitter cold
Free from conceiving the beginning
For that's the infinite start
I'm gone - gone but still living
Life goes on without a beating heart
Free like a vision
That the mind of only you can see
Freer than a raindrop
Falling from the sky
Freer than a smile in a baby's sleepin' eyes

[Chorus]
I'm free like a river
Flowin' freely through infinity
I'm free to be sure of what
I am and who I need not to be
I'm much freer - like the meaning of the word free that crazy man defines
Free - free like the vision that
The mind of only you are ever gonna see
Free like the river my life
Goes on and on through infinity

[Verse 1]
My style so sofa cause yea I'm always laid back
Walkin' through the grove with some slippers and a wave cap
My kicks so sick nigga I don't need a Maybach
Summer came early you want your fuckin May back
Cause I bring the heat nigga this is fuckin payback
Now I'm in LA where I lay at
Talk about heat, nigga, this is where they made that
I know that you digs me but where the fuck is Taye at?
Wow, to think you ignored him
Now I'm in my prime like one of the Transformers
Don't get mad I'm just following orders
To cut down haters and charm all of their daughters

Uh huh, you want me to keep goin?
Alright

[Verse 2]
A style so recliner because I will recline her
In about a half an hour so nigga check your timer
She is sick boy where'd you find her
I love these models slash handbag designers
Calling her a baby like I fuck with big timers
Cause I'm a big timer, got green like Slimer
Yeah, I just might slime her
And I ain't talkin' about the Hi-C drink neither
I'm sick in the worst way
Boy you mess with me it's 'bout to be your birthday
Whoops I meant merc day
Everyday's a work day
I love makin' shit, I don't need a vay-cay
And If you don't see me try my iPhone
Girl you don't know me, best to call Tyrone
Yeah my shit's viral, meanin' that it's internet
All up in your YouTubes, meaning that I'm into that
This a marathon yeah I'm winnin' that
I don't need a break I hate Kit Kat
These boys talk shit like shit chat
And I am the shit, I'm so Ex-lax
I'm the man out in Cali (x6)

[Verse 1]
Well, Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
I'll show you the ropes kid, show you the ropes
I got a bus and a trailer at my house, my house
I'll show you the ropes kid, show you the ropes
I bought fifteen cases for my house, my house
All the furniture is in the garage
Well, Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
You got to set them up kid, set them up

[Chorus]
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah

[Verse 2]
Well, Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
I waited 7 years and 15 days
There's every kid for miles at my house, my house
And the neighbors can't call the police
There's a fist fight brewin' at my house, my house
Because the jocks can't get in the door
When Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
You got to set them up kid, set them up

[Chorus]
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up

[Cowbell Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well, everybody's lined up in my house, my house

Got everybody's PA in my house, my house
All the robots descend from the bus
There's a freak out brewing in my house, my house
In the basement
'Cause Daft Punk is playing in my house, my house
You got to set them up kid, set them up

[Chorus]
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up

[Outro]
And never, never let them go
No never, never, never let them go

Really? Fuckin' "Condom Style"? "Get your jig on"?

20 years on me, me and my army
Feelin' like none of y'all niggas can harm me
I came from the bottom where they never make it at
With all my jewels on they ain't never takin' that
Theres rules to the game I ain't never breakin' that
And once you give a statement, nigga, you can never take it back
You lame part of the game, nigga pardon the fame
I got 30 in my clip I can park in your frame
Plus this Rollie on my wrist cost some cars and change
We talking bike life, 'bout to put a park in my name
Just to ride on you niggas, or slide on you niggas
G550 when we glide on you niggas like
Clyde on you niggas, homicide on you nigga
I ain't never had no rap, had no ties to you niggas, so
Why you suckas hatin' and talkin' 'bout what I'm makin'?
When I be out in Jamaica and ballin' like I'm like a Laker
It's givers and it's takers, these niggas is gettin faker
And I'm just gettin' richer I wake up and get my cake up!
Black Maserati, chinchillas for Papi
Ten killers beside me, all lookin' like ahkis
I remember nights on corners with beef and broccoli
Rice and gravy, now it's crazy cause Phillipe's got me
All gold AP, same watch as Jay-Z
Ballin' like I'm KD, how can niggas play me?
If you ain't talkin' money nigga fuck you, pay me
Drophead with the top down and the A.C
On, drawn, fuck is y'all doin'
I'mma king you a pawn, lil nigga I'mma Don
The coke price high, it cost 40 for a jawn
And like 20 for a half lil nigga do the math
And you talkin' bout a battle rap, how you gon' handle that?
100 grand pussy nigga, you ain't got the tab for that
You ain't got the stacks for that, you the one we laughin' at
You ain't got half of that, they pump you up: Asthma attack
Bye clown, calm down 'fore you make me bomb now
Fucking all these superstars like "Who Meek Milly bomb now?"
Went from driving Bentleys to going half on pie pounds
You niggas need to die down, Philly nigga: my town
I heard your car got re-poed
But this is bike life boy you just got Deebo'd
Them Twitter niggas fucking with your ego
You in the field tryna turn to God like Tebow
Naw that won't work nigga, that'll get you murked nigga
All-black Ghost nigga, looking like a hearse nigga
Been a dead man, so I'mma dig you out the Earth nigga
Just to stuff your skeleton right back into the dirt nigga
What you made this year? What you worth nigga?
I dropped "Dreams & Nightmares," I made church nigga
I did "I'ma Boss," youngin' set the summer off
Man these old niggas mad at me cause they fallin' off!
Ha! Get your hate on Cass
And we ain't talking larceny cause they all trash
And your goons ain't riding witcha, they all mad
Cause you ain't never put no food up in AR abs
My dog killed a body for ya, damn he didn't eat from it
Now you mad at Swizz cause you can't get a beat from him
Once my niggas coming at you dog, we gon' keep comin'
Weirdo Forest Gump nigga, better keep runnin'
D.C. nigga, you P.C. nigga
While you was scared, I was eatin' chichi nigga
Talking to Tip about how we gon' beast these niggas
All I know is bang bang, like that Chief Keef nigga
Got a matte black Aston, gold rims on it
Bitch looking like it got a pair of Timbs on it
Cashmere sweater, bunch of Jims on it
All my guns come with extends on it
Duck ? and hit up, tuck nigga you lit up
Cause you looking like food my youngins ready to get up
Call you for a verse and tell you to write some shit up
Boom, high stick up, jumping all out the pick up, woah

[Outro]
You know you fucked up right?
The "hustla"
You know you fucked up right?
Man I ain't doing this shit no more with you nut ass niggas
I came in the game, I ain't even signed a year nigga
I got more money than all you hatin' ass old niggas put together
Y'all niggas ain't do shit!
Talkin' all this Philly shit
Y'all niggas ain't put no foreigns out here nigga
All my niggas drive foreigns!
My niggas don't even rap and drive better cars than you niggas
Coon copped that 'Rari , you don't feel sorry for these bitch ass rappers!
You can't come to Philly no more!
And not even because of this, you was never comin' to Philly
You ain't been here eight years you pussy ass nigga!

[Intro]
One shot kill, one shot kill hey
One shot kill, hey, one shot kill
One shot kill go!
(Pump up the volume)
(Pump up the volume)

[Verse 1]
I say, thinkin' of a master plan
Motherfucker, I'm a mastermind
I'm an 18-year-old dollar sign
I'm a one-man tragedy, I'm Columbine
I'm sharp as fuck but no porcupine
Penitentiary blade to cut yo' ass up
Good-lookin' hunk
Lookin' for anybody thats lookin' for me
Shotty look 'em right in the eye
What do I see?
A scared nigga waitin' to die
A scared nigga, I even got you a suit and tie
Something suitable
Sledge hammer break down your nail cuticles
Nigga, I do the unusual
Torture
Anything is necessary in the art of war
Slam his head inside the suicidal doors
Do him like li'l man off Players Club
Roll around till his knees rub
Shit
I'm a ground hog
No, I'm a young hog
Hoggin' up all the money from all a y'all
It's funny how all y'all wanna be my associates
Come around, smile, like that shit is appropriate
I'ma put it to your skullcap and open it
Leave it on the side with that ho you was rollin' with
I'm rollin' with the nine millimeter close to my nuts and dick
You know who you fuckin' with?
I'm done with regular bowel movements
I'm on some other shit
I'm a fuckin beast, you a fuckin' bitch
I'ma fuck your bitch
Then send her back to you
Let her suck some dick, then let her kiss on you
Now, ain't that a bitch?
That ain't right, but that’s my life
If you don’t like then we gon’ fight
Psyche—you gon’ be fightin' a bullet
(Pump up the volume)
(Pump up the volume)

[Verse 2]
Where the pump at?
Thinkin' of a master plan
Mothafucker, I'm a mastermind
I'm a 18-year-old dollar sign
I'm a one-man tragedy, I'm Columbine
Shit, you already know what I'm about
Keep the guns by the couch in the living room
Company act up, we give it to them
Send it to them like emails
Let them sell his soul
Put his body on retail
If we do dirt and you tell
We gon’ put you under dirt
He was a good person
He was down to earth but now he down to earth
Chillin' with the worms and the insects, his brother gon’ be next
His mother gon’ be after him, kill the family tree
If they fuckin' with him and that "him" is me
And that limb is lost on your body
Aiming at your feet, probably

[Outro]
Training day
Sniper music
Sniper music
One shot kill
I told you before
One shot kill
I told you before
One shot kill
I told you before
One shot kill
One shot kill
One shot kill

[Intro: AJ]
Yeah-eh-eh

[Verse 1: Brian & Nick]
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

[Chorus: Nick & All]
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

[Verse 2: AJ with Brian]
Am I your fire?
Your one desire
Yes, I know it's too late
But I want it that way

[Chorus: AJ, All & Brian]
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

[Bridge: Kevin with AJ]
Now I can see that we're falling apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance
I want you to know
That deep down inside of me

[Reprise: Howie & All]
You are my fire
The one desire
You are (You are, you are, you are)

[Interlude: Nick & All]
Don't wanna hear you say
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
(Don't wanna hear you say)
I never wanna hear you say (Oh, yeah)
I want it that way

[Chorus: Brian, All, (Nick) & AJ]
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say (Don't wanna hear you say)
I want it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say (Never wanna hear you say, yeah)
I want it that way

Type of shit that be goin' through my mind, like
When I'm seein' dollars signs, like
Gold bars are obstacles I climb
Illuminator, haters find light
And they shittin' on them niggas, too
That's why I wake up feelin' like the truth
And that nigga won't be stopped
Hard hustle, just to take the pot
Niggas scheme every day, just to make a plot
Read between the lines, and connect the dots
Yeah, we livin' in tomorrow
2012 Bentley, clip full of hollows
Them niggas gettin' it in on the battlefield
Ten chains, five rangs, Soulja Lagerfield
Who knows, man? Just might
Fifty stars, thirteen stripes
Makin' history on a daily basis
Some people love it, some people hate it
I see it in their faces, you got the right grind
I'm not tryin' to get left on the sideline
So every day, I wake up to thank God
Check the guidelines, on the damn grind
Opinions on my timeline, I'm puttin' out
Real music's from the very start
And I do it fuckin' big 'cause they say I couldn't
And I do it even bigger 'cause they say I wouldn't
Rollin' numbers wit' a pair of dice
SODMG, that's paradise
I'm goin' out, smokin' as I flow
Me and Lo got this rap shit in the yolk
Couple helicopters, cribs, and a boat
Who the fuck's stoppin' us?
And they pullin' in blocks for us
Standin' outside all night, did a lot for bucks
Can't take none away from me

Dun Deal on the Track

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
My main bitch, her anklet
‘Bout the same size of a ankle monitor
If the bitch violate one time I'ma put her ass on probation
I'ma give her two scratches
She's a fuckin' good woman, I'mma give her a life
I'ma walk by shinin' with a bitch
Aye, say I had enough in my life
I got eighty chains, I got a hundred rings
And a nigga can’t take my ice
Caught a murder charge, but I beat the shit
‘Cause a nigga tried to take my life
I’m a millionaire, but I’m a country boy
And my right hand man got a Tonka toy
I sell, charge, I’m servin’ boy
Major saver, I’m the golden boy
Intercept the pack like Lawyer Milloy
Poppin’ and poppin’ and poppin’ the shit
Talkin’ that shit, now you shot in the head
Brick Squad niggas don’t shoot in the leg
Shouts to our fallen, I ball till I fall, and
The neighbors don’t talk ‘cause the neighbors are scared
A white girl, a black girl, a hell of a mix
Rollin’ up kush while they suckin’ my dick
On my team, it’s a tag-team
All my niggas get money
If you get tired, then tag in, then me and your freak’ll start fuckin'
Got two choppers, it’s a tag team
Four bad bitches and it’s all to me
Had to break into like ten houses to ride on these 9x17s
Oops, my fault, that’s your team’s line
I ain’t have time, I was grindin’ real hard
People goin’ crazy, and my mama goin’ crazy but belive it or not, bitch, I gotta thank the Lord
Ballin’ so hard when I came out of jail
Now I'mma get a scene now when the doors up
Sippin’ on lean ‘til I throw up
What you want to be when you grow up?

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
GuWop GuWop GuWop, nigga

Young Scooter in my team
Flockaveli that’s my shooter
R.I.P to my nigga Dunk
Think about your ass every day
Momma called, said she need some money
Sent her ten bands and it made her smile
Child nude, no shoes
Got to get him those new Trews
Mail your head to your mama
Hide your body in a restaurant
Nigga wasn’t shit anyway
Playin’ around with my awards
Gucci Mane is a cool dude
But a nigga might turn into a werewolf
Got a stash box and it’s all hundreds
And your CEO ain’t worth nothin’
Made a half a mil’ in three weeks
Gucci Mane, I’m a blessed man
I’m a real man, you can’t feel me, man
These fuck niggas keep tryin' to hold me back
Matter of fact, nigga slow down
When you drivin’ in the ‘Lac, you gon’ spill my ‘Gnac
Like Pinky, nigga, I’m big and black
Rock so many chains it gon hurt my neck

Her pussy bomb as Saddam Hussein, pussy nigga
Gucci needed me for a verse
Call me up, nigga, tag me in
This verse here, a tragedy
Bad bitches they after me
Only buy molly from rich hoes
‘Cause these broke hoes be taxin’ me
Got a problem with it?

Bomb squad like “Hoorah!”
Real niggas call Gucci
But these hoes call him “GuWop”

[Verse 1]
Money
Some people so poor; all that they've got is money
Oh, and diamonds
Some people waste their life counting their thousands

[Chorus]
I don't care what they're offering
How much gold they bring
They can't afford what we've got
Not even the king
They can't afford what we've got
Not even the king

[Verse 2]
Oh, castles
Some people so lonely; what good is a castle?
Surrounded by people
But ain't got a friend that's not on the payroll

[Chorus]
Oh, and I don't care what they bring
They can have everything
They can't afford what we've got
Not even the king
They can't afford what we've got
Not even the king

[Verse 3]
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Came charging to get what we got
They offered the crown and the offered the throne
I already got all that I want
All the king's horses and all the king's men
They came marching through
They offered the world just to have what we got
But I found the world in you
I found the world in you

[Chorus 2]
So darling, listen:
Your arms around me worth more than a kingdom
Yeah, believe that
The trust that we feel the kings never felt that
Yeah, this is the song that we sing
We don't need anything
They can't afford this
This is priceless
Can't afford what we've got
Not even the king
Can't afford what we've got
Not even the king

[Verse 1]
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
I’ve stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I’ve walked and I’ve crawled on six crooked highways
I’ve stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I’ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I’ve been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard

[Chorus]
And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

[Verse 2]
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten-thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children

[Chorus]
And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

[Verse 3]
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing
I heard ten-thousand whispering and nobody listening
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley

[Chorus]
And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

[Verse 4]
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman, her body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded in hatred

[Chorus]
And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

[Verse 5]
And what will you do now, my blue-eyed son?
And what will you do now, my darling young one?
I’m a-going back out ’fore the rain starts a-falling
I’ll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
And the executioner’s face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I’ll tell it, and speak it, and think it, and breathe it
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then I’ll stand on the ocean until I start sinking
But I’ll know my song well before I start singing

[Chorus]
And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

[Chorus: Bob Marley]
Could you be loved and be love?
Could you be loved and be love?

[Verse 1]
Don't let them fool ya
Or even try to school ya! Oh, no!
We've got a mind of our own
So go to hell, if what you're thinking isn't right!
Love would never leave us alone
A-in the darkness, there must come out to light

[Chorus: Bob Marley]
Could you be loved and be love?
Could you be loved, wo yeah! - and be loved?
Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved, wo yeah! - and be loved?

[Bridge: I Threes]
The road of life is rocky and you may stumble too
So while you point your fingers someone else is judging you

[Refrain: Bob Marley and I Threes]
Love your brotherman!
Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?
Could you be, could you be loved?
Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?
Could you be, could you be loved?

[Verse 2: Bob Marley and (I Threes)]
Don't let them change ya, oh!
(Scat singing)
Or even rearrange ya!
(Scat singing)
Oh, no!
We've got a life to live
(Ooh, ooh, ooohh)
They say, Only... Only
Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive -
Stay alive! Ehh!

[Chorus: Bob Marley]
Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved, woah yeah! - and be loved?

[Bridge: I Threes]
Never miss your water until your well runs dry
No matter how you treat him, the man will never be satisfied

[Outro: Bob Marley and (I Threes)]
Say something! (Could you be - could you be - could you be loved?
Could you be - could you be loved?)
Say something! Say something!
(Could you be - could you be - could you be loved?)
Say something!
Say something! Say something! Say something!
Say something! Say something! (Could you be loved?)
Say something! Say something! Reggae, reggae!
Say something! Rockers, rockers!
Say something! Reggae, reggae!
Say something! Rockers, rockers!
Say something! (Could you be loved?)
Say something! Uh!
Say something! Come on!
Say something! (Could you be - could you be - could you be loved?)
Say something! (Could you be - could you be loved?)
Say something! (Could you be - could you be - could you be loved?)
Say something!
Say something

[Verse 1]
If you’re travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine

[Verse 2]
If you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see if she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling winds

[Verse 3]
Please see if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair's hangin' long
For that’s the way I remember her best

[Verse 4]
I’m a-wondering if she remembers me at all
Many times I’ve often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day

[Verse 5]
So if you’re travelin' the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine

[Intro]
Unlike most of the songs nowadays that have been written up in Tin Pan Alley, that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this, this is a song, this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States

[Verse 1]
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto
They are riding down the line
Fixing everybody’s troubles
Everybody’s except mine
Somebody must have told them
That I was doing fine

[Verse 2]
Oh you five and ten cent women
With nothing in your heads
I got a real gal I’m loving
And Lord I’ll love her till I’m dead
Go away from my door and my window too
Right now

[Verse 3]
Lord, I am not going down to no race track
See no sports car run
I don’t have no sports car
And I don’t even care to have one
I can walk anytime around the block

[Verse 4]
Well, the wind keeps a-blowing me
Up and down the street
With my hat in my hand
And my boots on my feet
Watch out so you don’t step on me

[Verse 5]
Well, look it here buddy
You want to be like me
Pull out your six-shooter
And rob every bank you can see
Tell the judge I said it was all right
Yes!

[Verse 1]
While riding on a train going west
I fell asleep for to take my rest
I dreamed a dream that made me sad
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had

[Verse 2]
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon
Where we together weathered many a storm
Laughin and singin till the early hours of the morn

[Verse 3]
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung
Our words was told, our songs was sung
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied
Jokin' and talkin' about the world outside

[Verse 4]
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold
We never much thought we could get very old
We thought we could sit forever in fun
And our chances really was a million to one

[Instrument Break]

[Verse 5]
As easy it was to tell black from white
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split

[Verse 6]
How many a year has passed and gone
Many a gamble has been lost and won
And many a road taken by many a first friend
And each one I’ve never seen again

[Instrument Break]

[Verse 7]
I wish, I wish, I wish in vain
That we could sit simply in that room again
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat
And I’d give it all gladly if our lives could be like that

[Verse 1]
Oxford Town, Oxford Town
Everybody’s got their heads bowed down
The sun don’t shine above the ground
I am a-going down to Oxford Town

[Verse 2]
He went down to Oxford Town
Guns and clubs followed him down
All because his face was brown
Better get away from Oxford Town

[Verse 3]
Oxford Town around the bend
Come in to the door, he couldn’t get in
All because of the color of his skin
What do you think about that, my friend?

[Verse 4]
Me, my girl, my girl’s son
We got met with a tear gas bomb
I don’t even know why we come
Going back where we come from

[Verse 5]
Oxford Town in the afternoon
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune
Two men died beneath the Mississippi moon
Somebody better investigate soon

[Verse 1]
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To get along with you
Honey, just allow me one more chance
I'll do anything for you
Well, I’m a-walking down the road
With my head in my hand
I’m looking for a woman
Needs a worried man
Just a-one kind favor I ask you
Allow me just a one more chance

[Verse 2]
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To ride your airplane
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To ride your passenger train
Well, I’ve been looking all over
For a girl like you
I can’t find no better
So you’ll have to do
There's just-a one kind favor I ask you
Allow me just-a one more chance

[Verse 3]
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To get along with you
Honey, just allow me one more chance
I'll do anything for you
Well, looking for a woman
That ain't got no man
Is just looking for a needle
That's lost in the sand
Just-a one kind favor I ask you
Allow me just-a one more chance

[Verse 1]
Seen the arrow on the doorpost
Saying, “This land is condemned
All the way from New Orleans
To Jerusalem”
I traveled through East Texas
Where many martyrs fell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

[Verse 2]
Well, I heard that hoot owl singing
As they were taking down the tents
The stars above the barren trees
Was his only audience
Them charcoal gypsy maidens
Can strut their feathers well
But nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

[Verse 3]
See them big plantations burning
Hear the cracking of the whips
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming
See the ghosts of slavery ships
I can hear them tribes moaning
Hear that undertaker’s bell
Nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

[Verse 4]
There’s a woman by the river
With some fine young handsome man
He’s dressed up like a squire
Bootlegged whiskey in his hand
There’s a chain gang on the highway
I can hear them rebels yell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

[Verse 5]
Well, God is in His heaven
And we all want what’s His
But power and greed and corruptible seed
Seem to be all that there is
I’m gazing out the window
Of the St. James Hotel
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

[Verse 1]
Well, I took me a woman late last night
I’s three-fourths drunk, she looked alright
'Til she started peeling off her onion gook
Took off her wig, said, “How do I look?"
I's high flying, bare-naked
Out the window

[Verse 2]
Well, sometimes I might get drunk
Walk like a duck and smell like a skunk
Don’t hurt me none, it don’t hurt my pride
Because I got my little lady right by my side
She's a-tryin' to hide, pretendin' she don't know me

[Verse 3]
I’s out there painting on the old woodshed
When a can of black paint, it fell on my head
I went down to scrub and rub
But I had to sit in back of the tub
Cost a quarter
Half price

[Verse 4]
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop
It’s President Kennedy calling me up
He said, “My friend, Bob
What do we need to make the country grow?”
I said, “My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot
Anita Ekberg
Sophia Loren”
Country'll grow

[Verse 5]
Well, I got a woman, five feet short
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head
Rolls me over and kicks me out of bed
She’s a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser

[Verse 6]
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time
I got a woman who works herself blind
Works up to her britches, up to her neck
Writes me letters and sends me checks
She’s a humdinger, folk singer

[Verse 7]
Late one day in the middle of the week
Eyes were closed, I was half asleep
I chased me a woman up the hill
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill
I jumped a fallout shelter
I jumped a string bean
I jumped a TV dinner
I jumped a shotgun

[Verse 8]
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote
He’s a-running for office on the ballot note
He’s out there preaching in front of the steeple
Telling me he loves all kinds of people
He’s eatin' bagels
He’s eatin' pizza
He’s eatin' chitlins

[Verse 9]
Oh, set me down on a television floor
I’ll flip the channel to number four
Out of the shower comes a football man
With a bottle of oil in his hand
Greasy kid stuff
What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is
What do you do about Willy Mays
Martin Luther King
Olatunji

[Verse 10]
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean
She takes about fifteen baths a day
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face
She’s insane

[Verse 11]
Well, they ask me why I’m drunk all the time
It levels my head and eases my mind
I just walk along and stroll and sing
I see better days and I do better things
I catch dinosaurs
Make love to Elizabeth Taylor
Catch hell from Richard Burton

[Verse 1]
Corrina, Corrina
Girl, where you been so long?
Corrina, Corrina
Girl, where you been so long?
I been worrying about you, baby
Baby, please come home

[Verse 2]
I got a bird that whistles
I got a bird that sings
I got a bird that whistles
I got a bird that sings
But I ain't got Corrina
Life don’t mean a thing

[Verse 3]
Corrina, Corrina
Girl, you’re on my mind
Corrina, Corrina
Girl, you’re on my mind
I’m a-sittin down thinkin of you
I just can’t keep from crying

[Verse 1]
Well, I’m walking down the highway
With my suitcase in my hand
Yes, I’m walking down the highway
With my suitcase in my hand
Lord, I really miss my baby
She’s in some foreign land

[Verse 2]
Well, your streets are getting empty
Lord, your highway’s getting filled
And your streets are getting empty
And your highway’s getting filled
Well, the way I love that woman
I swear it’s bound to get me killed

[Verse 3]
Well, I've been gambling so long
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose
Yes, I've been gambling so long
Lord, I ain't a-got much more to lose
Right now I’m having trouble
Please don’t take away my highway shoes

[Verse 4]
Well, I’m bound to get lucky, baby
Or I’m bound to die trying
Yes, I’m a-bound to get lucky, baby
Lord, Lord, I’m a-bound to die trying
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
And we’ll leave this old highway behind

[Verse 5]
Well, the ocean took my baby
My baby stole my heart from me
Yes, the ocean took my baby
My baby took my heart from me
She packed it all up in a suitcase
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy

[Verse 6]
So, I’m a-walking down your highway
Just as far as my poor eyes can see
Yes, I’m a-walking down your highway
Just as far as my eyes can see
From the Golden Gate Bridge
All the way to the Statue of Liberty
Uncle Albert

[Verse 1]
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
We're so sorry if we caused you any pain
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But there's no one left at home, and I believe I'm gonna rain

[Verse 2]
We're so sorry, but we haven't heard a thing all day
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But if anything should happen, we'll be sure to give a ring

[Verse 3]
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But we haven't done a bloody thing all day
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But the kettle's on the boil and we're so easily called away

[Instrumental]
Admiral Halsey

[Intro]

[Chorus]
Hands across the water (Water)
Heads across the sky
Hands across the water (Water)
Heads across the sky

[Verse 1]
Admiral Halsey notified me
He had to have a berth or he couldn't get to sea
I had another look, and I had a cup of tea and a butter pie (Butter pie?)
(The butter wouldn't melt so I put it in the pie, alright?)

[Chorus]
Hands across the water (Water)
Heads across the sky
Hands across the water (Water)
Heads across the sky

[Bridge]
Live a little, be a gypsy, get around (Get around)
Get your feet up off the ground
Live a little, get around
Live a little, be a gypsy, get around (Get around)
Get your feet up off the ground
Live a little, get around

[Chorus]
Hands across the water (Water)
Heads across the sky
Hands across the water (Water)
Heads across the sky

[Verse 1]
Every step of the way we walk the line
Your days are numbered, so are mine
Time is piling’ up, we struggle and we scrape
We’re all boxed in, nowhere to escape

[Verse 2]
City’s just a jungle; more games to play
Trapped in the heart of it, tryin' to get away
I was raised in the country, I been working’ in the town
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down

[Verse 3]
Got nothing' for you, I had nothin' before
Don’t even have anything for myself anymore
Sky full of fire, pain pourin’ down
Nothing you can sell me, I’ll see you around

[Verse 4]
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

[Verse 5]
Well, the devil’s in the alley, mule’s in the stall
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all
I was thinkin’ 'bout the things that Rosie said
I was dreaming I was sleepin' in Rosie’s bed

[Verse 6]
Walking through the leaves, falling from the trees
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees
So many things that we never will undo
I know you’re sorry; I’m sorry, too

[Verse 7]
Some people will offer you their hand and some won’t
Last night I knew you, tonight I don’t
I need something strong to distract my mind
I’m gonna look at you ’til my eyes go blind

[Verse 8]
Well I got here followin' the southern star
I crossed that river just to be where you are
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

[Verse 9]
Well my ship’s been split to splinters and it’s sinkin' fast
I’m drowning in the poison; got no future, got no past
But my heart is not weary, it’s light and it’s free
I’ve got nothing but affection for all those who’ve sailed with me

[Verse 10]
Everybody moving if they ain’t already there
Everybody got to move somewhere
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow
Things should start to get interestin' right about now

[Verse 11]
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in
I know that fortune is waitin’ to be kind
So give me your hand and say you’ll be mine

[Verse 12]
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay
You can always come back, but you can’t come back all the way
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

[Verse 1]
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks
Preoccupied with his vengeance
Cursing the dead that can’t answer him back
I’m sure that he has no intentions
Of looking your way, unless it’s to say
That he needs you to test his inventions

[Chorus]
Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won’t ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to

[Verse 2]
He looks so truthful, is this how he feels
Trying to peel the moon and expose it
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel
If he needs a third eye he just grows it
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk
Or pick it up after he throws it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Their religion of the little tin women
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised
Come on out the dark is beginning

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Trust yourself
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best
Trust yourself
Trust yourself to do what’s right and not be second-guessed
Don’t trust me to show you beauty
When beauty may only turn to rust
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself

[Verse 2]
Trust yourself
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end
Trust yourself
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when
Don’t trust me to show you the truth
When the truth may only be ashes and dust
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself

[Verse 3]
Well, you’re on your own, you always were
In a land of wolves and thieves
Don’t put your hope in ungodly man
Or be a slave to what somebody else believes

[Verse 4]
Trust yourself
And you won’t be disappointed when vain people let you down
Trust yourself
And look not for answers where no answers can be found
Don’t trust me to show you love
When my love may be only lust
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself

[Chorus]
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago

[Verse 1]
He saw an animal that liked to growl
Big furry paws and he liked to howl
Great big furry back and furry hair
“Ah, think I'll call it a bear”

[Chorus]
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago

[Verse 2]
He saw an animal up on a hill
Chewing up so much grass until he was filled
He saw milk coming out but he didn't know how
“Ah, think I'll call it a cow”

[Chorus]
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago

[Verse 3]
He saw an animal that liked to snort
Horns on his head and they weren't too short
It looked like there wasn’t nothing that he couldn't pull
“Ah, think I'll call it a bull”

[Chorus]
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago

[Verse 4]
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail
Real dirty face and a curly tail
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big
“Ah, think I'll call it a pig”

[Chorus]
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago

[Verse 5]
Next animal that he did meet
Had wool on his back and hooves on his feet
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep
“Ah, think I'll call it a sheep”

[Chorus]
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago

[Outro]
He saw an animal as smooth as glass
Slithering his way through the grass
Saw him disappear by a tree near a lake

[Verse 1]
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
About a man riding ’cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck

[Verse 2]
Well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
As the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath
“Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square
I want him to feel what it’s like to every moment face his death”

[Verse 3]
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
And you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain
You know I can’t believe we’ve lived so long and are still so far apart
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train

[Verse 4]
I can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet
Ah, but you were right. It was perfect as I got in behind the wheel

[Verse 5]
Well, we drove that car all night into San Anton’
And we slept near the Alamo, your skin was so tender and soft
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back
I would have gone on after you but I didn’t feel like letting my head get blown off

[Verse 6]
Well, we’re drivin’ this car and the sun is comin’ up over the Rockies
Now I know she ain’t you but she’s here and she’s got that dark rhythm in her soul
But I’m too over the edge and I ain’t in the mood anymore to remember the times
When I was your only man
And she don’t want to remind me
She knows this car would go out of control

[Chorus]
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world
Brownsville girl, you’re my honey love

[Verse 7]
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live. He owned a Wreckin’ lot outside of town about a mile
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back. She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust
She said, “Henry ain’t here but you can come on in, he’ll be back in a little while”

[Verse 8]
Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinking’ of
Bumming a ride back from where she started
But ya know, she changed the subject every time money came up
She said, “Welcome to the land of the living dead”
You could tell she was so broken hearted
She said, “Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt”

[Verse 9]
“How far are y’all going?” Ruby asked us with a sigh
“We’re going all the way ’til the wheels fall off and burn
’Til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies”
Ruby just smiled and said, “Ah, you know some babies never learn”

[Verse 10]
Something about that movie though, well I just can’t get it out of my head
But I can’t remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play
All I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved
And a lot of them seemed to be looking’ my way

[Chorus]
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world
Brownsville girl, you’re my honey love

[Verse 11]
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour
I was crossing’ the street when shots rang out
I didn’t know whether to duck or to run, so I ran
“We got him cornered in the churchyard,” I heard somebody shout

[Verse 12]
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune. Underneath it
It said, “A man with no alibi”
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you
Then when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears
It was the best acting I saw anybody do

[Verse 13]
Now I’ve always been the kind of person that doesn’t like to trespass
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line
Oh if there’s an original thought out there, I could use it right now
You know, I feel pretty good, but that is not sayin’ much
I could feel a whole lot better
If you were just here by my side to show me how

[Verse 14]
Well, I’m standing’ in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck
Yeah, but you know it’s not the one that I had in mind
He’s got a new one out now, I don’t even know what it’s about
But I’ll see him in anything so I’ll stand in line

[Chorus]
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world
Brownsville girl, you’re my honey love

[Verse 15]
You know, it’s funny how things never turn out the way you had ’em planned
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter is that his name wasn’t Henry Porter
And you know there was somethin’ about you baby that I liked that was always too good for this world
Just like you always said there was somethin’ about me you liked
That I left behind in the French Quarter

[Verse 16]
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who are most content
I don’t have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when I’m gone
You always said people don’t do what they believe in, they just do what’s most convenient, then they repent
And I always said, “Hang on to me, baby, and let’s hope that the roof stays on”

[Verse 17]
There was a movie I seen one time, I think I sat through it twice
I don’t remember who I was or where I was bound
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck, he wore a gun
And he was shot in the back
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down

[Chorus]
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world
Brownsville girl, you’re my honey love

[Verse 1]
You may be an ambassador to England or France
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls

[Chorus]
But you’re going to have to serve somebody, yes indeed
You’re going to have to serve somebody
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord
But you’re going to have to serve somebody

[Verse 2]
You might be a rock ’n’ roll addict prancing on the stage
You might have drugs at your command, women in a cage
You may be a business man or some high-degree thief
They may call you Doctor or they may call you Chief

[Chorus]
But you’re going to have to serve somebody, yes indeed
You’re going to have to serve somebody
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord
But you’re going to have to serve somebody

[Verse 3]
You may be a state trooper, you might be a young Turk
You may be the head of some big TV network
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame
You may be living in another country under another name

[Chorus]
But you’re going to have to serve somebody, yes indeed
You’re going to have to serve somebody
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord
But you’re going to have to serve somebody

[Verse 4]
You may be a construction worker working on a home
You may be living in a mansion or you might live in a dome
You might own guns and you might even own tanks
You might be somebody’s landlord, you might even own banks

[Chorus]
But you’re going to have to serve somebody, yes indeed
You’re going to have to serve somebody
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord
But you’re going to have to serve somebody

[Verse 5]
You may be a preacher with your spiritual pride
You may be a city councilman taking bribes on the side
You may be working in a barbershop
You may know how to cut hair
You may be somebody’s mistress, may be somebody’s heir

[Chorus]
But you’re going to have to serve somebody, yes indeed
You’re going to have to serve somebody
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord
But you’re going to have to serve somebody

[Verse 6]
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk
You might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread
You may be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-sized bed

[Chorus]
But you’re going to have to serve somebody, yes indeed
You’re going to have to serve somebody
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord
But you’re going to have to serve somebody

[Verse 7]
You may call me Terry, you may call me Timmy
You may call me Bobby, you may call me Zimmy
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray
You may call me anything but no matter what you say

[Chorus]
You're still gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed
You’re going to have to serve somebody
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord
But you’re going to have to serve somebody

[Verse 1]
Precious angel
Under the sun
How was I to know
You'd be the one
To show me I was blinded
To show me I was gone
How weak was the foundation
I was standing upon?

Now there's spiritual warfare
And flesh and blood breaking down
You either got faith or you got unbelief
And there is no neutral ground
The enemy is subtle
How be it we are so deceived
When the truth's in our hearts
And we still don't believe?

[Chorus]
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
You know I just couldn't make it by myself
I'm a little too blind to see

[Verse 2]
My so-called friends
Have fallen under a spell
They look me squarely in the eye
And they say, "All is well"
Can they imagine the darkness
That will fall from on high
When men will beg God to kill them
And they won't be able to die?

Sister, let me tell you
About a vision that I saw
You were drawing water for your husband
You were suffering under the law
You were telling him about Buddha
You were telling him about Mohammed, in one breath
You never mentioned one time
The Man who came and died a criminal's death

[Chorus]
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
You know I just couldn't make it by myself
I'm a little too blind to see

[Verse 3]
Precious angel
You believe me when I say
What God has given to us
No man can take away
We are covered in blood, girl
You know both our forefathers were slaves
Let us hope they've found mercy
In their bone-filled graves

You're the queen of my flesh, girl
You're my woman, you're my delight
You're the lamp of my soul, girl
And you torch up the night
But there's violence in the eyes, girl
So let us not be enticed
On the way out of Egypt
Through Ethiopia
To the judgment hall of Christ

[Chorus]
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
You know I just couldn't make it by myself
I'm a little too blind to see

[Outro]
(Shine your light, shine your light on me)
(Shine your light, shine your light on me)
(Shine your light, shine your light on me)
(Shine your light, shine your light on me)
(Shine your light, shine your light on me)
(Shine your light, shine your light on me)
(Shine your light, shine your light on me)
(Shine your light, shine your light on me)

[Verse 1]
They ask me how I feel
And if my love is real
And how I know I'll make it through
And they, they look at me and frown
They'd like to drive me from this town
They don't want me around
Because I believe in you

[Verse 2]
They, they show me to the door
They say, "Don't come back no more"
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
And I, I walk out on my own
A thousand miles from home
But I don't feel alone
Because I believe in you

[Chorus]
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter
L believe in you even though we be apart
I believe in you even on the morning after
Oh, when the dawn is nearing
Oh, when the night is disappearing
Oh, this feeling is still here in my heart

[Verse 3]
Don't let me drift too far
Keep me where you are
Where I will always be renewed
And that which you've given me today
Is worth more than I could pay
And no matter what they say
I believe in you

[Chorus]
L believe in you when winter turns to summer
I believe in you when white turn to black
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered
Oh, though the earth may shake me
Oh, though my friends forsake me
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back

[Verse 4]
Don't let me change my heart
Keep me set apart
From all the plans they do pursue
And I, I don't mind the pain
Don't mind the driving rain
I know I will sustain
Because I believe in you

[Verse 1]
Sometimes
I feel so low-down and disgusted
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions
Are they lost or are they found?
Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
All their earthly principles they're going to have to abandon?
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

[Verse 2]
I had a woman
Down in Alabama
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic
She said, "Boy, without a doubt
Have to quit your mess and straighten out
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic"
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

[Verse 3]
All that foreign oil
Controlling American soil
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed
Sheiks walking around like kings
Wearing fancy jewels and nose rings
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam and Paris
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

[Verse 4]
Man's ego is inflated
His laws are outdated,
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting
In the home of the brave
Jefferson turning over in his grave
Fools glorifying themselves, trying to manipulate Satan
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

[Verse 5]
Big-time negotiators
False healers and woman-haters
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition
But the enemy I see
Wears a cloak of decency
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

[Verse 6]
People starving and thirsting
Grain elevators are bursting
Oh, you know it costs more to store the food than it do to give it
They say, "Lose your inhibitions
Follow your own ambitions"
They talk about a life of brotherly love; show me someone who knows how to live it
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

[Verse 7]
Well, my baby went to Illinois
With some bad-talking boy she could destroy
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it
I don't care about economy
I don't care about astronomy
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

[Verse 1]
Change my way of thinking
Make myself a different set of rules
Gonna change my way of thinking
Make myself a different set of rules
Going to put my good foot forward
Stop being influenced by fools

[Verse 2]
So much oppression
Can't keep track of it no more
So much oppression
Can't keep track of it no more
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers
Old men turning young daughters into whores

[Verse 3]
Stripes on your shoulders
Stripes on your back and on your hands
Stripes on your shoulders
Stripes on your back and on your hands
Swords piercing your side
Blood and water flowing through the land

[Verse 4]
Well, I don't know which one is worse
Doing your own thing or just being cool
Don't know which one is worse
Doing your own thing or being cool
You remember only about the brass ring
You forget all about the golden rule

[Verse 5]
You can mislead a man
You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes
You can mislead a man
You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes
But there's only one authority
And that's the authority on high

[Verse 6]
I got a God-fearing woman
One I can easily afford
I got a God-fearing woman
One I can easily afford
She can do the Georgia Crawl
She can walk in the Spirit of the Lord

[Verse 7]
Jesus said, "Be ready
For you know not the hour in which I come"
Jesus said, "Be ready
For you know not the hour in which I come"
He said, "He who is not for Me is against Me"
Just so you know where He's coming from

[Verse 8]
There's a kingdom called Heaven
A place where there is no pain of birth
There's a place called Heaven
A place where there is no pain of birth
Well the Lord created it, mister
About the same time that He made the earth

[Verse 1]
Don't want to judge nobody, don't want to be judged
Don't want to touch nobody, don't want to be touched
Don't want to hurt nobody, don't want to be hurt
Don't want to treat nobody like they was dirt

[Chorus]
But if you do right to me, baby
I'll do right to you, too
You got to do unto others
Like you'd have them, like you'd have them do unto you

[Verse 2]
Don't want to shoot nobody, don't want to be shot
Don't want to buy nobody, don't want to be bought
Don't want to bury nobody, don't want to be buried
Don't want to marry nobody if they're already married

[Chorus]
But if you do right to me, baby
I'll do right to you, too
You got to do unto others
Like you'd have them, like you'd have them do unto you

[Verse 3]
Don't want to burn nobody, don't want to be burned
Don't want to learn from nobody what I got to unlearn
Don't want to cheat nobody, don't want to be cheated
Don't want to defeat nobody if they already been defeated

[Chorus]
But if you do right to me, baby
I'll do right to you, too
You got to do unto others
Like you'd have them, like you'd have them do unto you

[Verse 4]
Don't want to wink at nobody, I don't want to be winked at
Don't want to be used by nobody for a doormat
Don't want to confuse nobody, don't want to be confused
Don't want to amuse nobody, I don't want to be amused

[Chorus]
But if you do right to me, baby
I'll do right to you, too
You got to do unto others
Like you'd have them, like you'd have them do unto you

[Verse 5]
Don't want to betray nobody, don't want to be betrayed
Don't want to play with nobody, don't want to be waylaid
Don't want to miss nobody, don't want to be missed
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist

[Chorus]
But if you do right to me, baby
I'll do right to you, too
You got to do unto others
Like you'd have them, like you'd have them do unto you

[Verse 1]
Dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
I got my flower, I got my power
I got a woman who knows

[Chorus]
I said it's all right, you know it's all right
I guess it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?

[Verse 2]
Crazy ways are evident
By the way you wearing your clothes
Sipping booze is precedent
As the evening starts to glow

[Chorus]
You know it's all right, I said it's all right
You know it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?
Dig

[Verse 3]
You told your mama I'd get you home
But you didn't say that I got no car
I saw a lion, he was standing alone
With a tadpole in a jar

[Chorus]
You know it's all right
I said it's all right
I guess it's all in my heart, heart, heart
You'll be my only
My one and only
Is that the way it should start?

[Verse 1]
So dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
You are my flower, you are my power
You are my woman who knows

[Chorus]
I said it's all right
You know it's all right
You know it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, yes
My one and only, yes
Is that the way it should start?
I know it is, yeah!

[Verse 1]
God don’t make no promises that He don’t keep
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep

[Chorus]
When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

[Verse 2]
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts
Karl Marx has got ya by the throat and Henry Kissinger’s got you tied up in knots

[Chorus]
When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

[Verse 3]
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that’ll never cure your ills

[Chorus]
When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

[Verse 4]
You got men who can’t hold their peace and women who can’t control their tongues
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young

[Chorus]
When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

[Verse 5]
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules

[Chorus]
When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

[Verse 6]
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move
Instant inner peace and every step you take has got to be approved

[Chorus]
When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

[Verse 7]
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
You think He’s just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires

[Chorus]
When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

[Verse 8]
You can’t take it with you and you know that it’s too worthless to be sold
They tell you, “Time is money,” as if your life was worth its weight in gold

[Chorus]
When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

[Verse 9]
There’s a Man up on a cross and He’s been crucified for you
Beleive in  His power, it's all about you got to do

[Chorus]
When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

[Verse 1]
The iron hand, it ain't match for the iron rod
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty God
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears
It is only He who can reduce me to tears
Don’t you cry and don’t you die and don’t you burn
For like a thief in the night, He’ll replace wrong with right
When He returns

[Verse 2]
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Will I ever learn that there’ll be no peace, that the war won’t cease
Until He returns?

[Verse 3]
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take off your mask
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Of every earthly plan that be known to man, He is unconcerned
He’s got plans of His own to set up His throne
When He returns

[Verse 1]
Well, I ride on a mail train, baby
Can't buy a thrill
Well, I been up all night
Leanin' on the windowsill
Well, if I die
On top of the hill
And if I don’t make it
You know my baby will

[Verse 2]
Don't the moon look good, mama
Shining through the trees?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama
Flaggin' down the “Double E?”
Don't the sun look good
Goin' down over the sea?
But don’t my gal look fine
When she's comin' after me?

[Verse 3]
Now the wintertime is coming
The windows are filled with frost
I went to tell everybody
But I could not get across
Well, I want to be your lover, baby
I don’t want to be your boss
Don’t say I never warned you
When your train gets lost

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Got dogs on the chains don't let em get loose
Sippin rich man juice thats a fo and a deuce
All my cars ain't got no roof
And I plead not guilty they ain't got no proof
Look in my closet I ain't got no suits

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Gotta bitch so bad, look ya give her note pad

Sliding down South Beach with the Georgia tag

Red bottom heels and they match her bag
And she ridin' round the city just droppin' off swag
Real fat ass, do you got a man?

(Yeah I'm smokin' on that loud pack, and that's that)
(That's dro-oh-oh)

[Verse 1]
I got this graveyard woman, you know
She keeps my kids
But my soulful mama, you know
She keeps me hid
She’s a junkyard angel, and she
Always gives me bread

[Chorus]
Well, if I go down dyin', you know
She bound to put a blanket on my bed

[Verse 2]
Well, when the pipeline gets broken
And I'm lost on the river bridge
I’m all cracked up on the highway
And in the water’s edge
Here again she comes, down the thruway
Ready to sew me up with a thread

[Chorus]
Well, if I go down dyin', you know
She bound to put a blanket on my bed

[Verse 3]
Well, she don’t make me nervous
She don’t talk too much
She walks like Bo Diddley
And she don’t need no crutch
She keeps this .410
All loaded with lead

[Chorus]
Well, if I go down dyin', you know
She bound to put a blanket on my bed

[Bridge]
Come on!

[Verse 4]
Well, you know I
Need a steam shovel, mama, to
Keep away the dead
I need a dump truck, baby, to
Unload my head
She brings me everything and more
And just like I said

[Chorus]
Well, if I go down dyin', you know
She bound to put a blanket on my bed

[Verse 1]
Oh, God said to Abraham, “Kill me a son”
Abe said, “Man, you must be puttin' me on”
God say, “No.”
Abe say, “What?”
God say, “You can do what you want, Abe, but
The next time you see me comin' you better run”
Well, Abe said, “Where you want this killin' done?"
God said, “Out on Highway 61”

[Verse 2]
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose
Welfare Department, they wouldn’t give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
Howard said, "There’s only one place I know"
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man, I got to run"
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
And said, "That way, down Highway 61"

[Verse 3]
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
"I got forty red, white and blue shoestrings
And a thousand telephones that don’t ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
And Louie the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son"
And he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done!
Just take everything down to Highway 61"

[Verse 4]
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren’t right
"My complexion," she says "is much too white"
He said, "Come here and step into the light"
He says, "Hmm you’re right
Let me tell the second mother this has been done"
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61

[Verse 5]
Now, the rovin' gambler, he was very bored
Tryin' to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done
We’ll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And have it on Highway 61"

[Verse 1]
Well I told my baby
I said "Baby, I know
Where you been
Well, I know who you are
And what league you played in"
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn

[Verse 2]
Well, the night is so empty
So quiet and still
For only fifteen
Hundred dollars
You can have anybody killed
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn

[Verse 3]
Well, I told my baby
Further down the line
I said, "What happens tomorrow
Is on your head, not mine"
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn

[Verse 1]
He was a friend of mine
He was a friend of mine
Every time I think about him now
Lord I just can't keep from crying
'Cause he was a friend of mine

[Verse 2]
He died on the road
He died on the road
He never had enough money
To pay his room or board
And he was a friend of mine

[Verse 3]
I stole away and cried
I stole away and cried
'Cause I never had too much money
And I never been quite satisfied
And he was a friend of mine

[Verse 4]
He never done no wrong
He never done no wrong
A thousand miles from home
And he never harmed no one
And he was a friend of mine

[Verse 5]
He was a friend of mine
He was a friend of mine
Every time I hear his name
Lord I just can't keep from crying
'Cause he was a friend of mine

[Verse 1]
I can't understand, she let go of my hand
And left me here facing the wall
I’d sure like to know why she'd go
But I can't get close to her at all

Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime
She said she would never forget
But now morning’s clear, it’s like I ain't here
She acts like we never met

[Verse 2]
It’s all new to me, like some mystery
It could even be like a myth
But it’s hard to think on that she’s the same one
That last night I was with

From darkness, dreams are deserted
Am I still dreaming yet?
I wish she’d unlock her voice once and talk
'Stead of actin' like we never have met

[Verse 3]
If she ain't feelin' well, then why don’t she tell
'Stead of turnin' her back to my face?
Without any doubt, she seems too far out
For me to return to or chase

Well her skirt it swayed as the guitar played
Her mouth was watery and wet
But now something has changed, for she ain't the same
She just acts like we never have met

[Verse 4]
If I didn’t have to guess, I’d gladly confess
To anything I might’ve tried
If I was with her too long or have done something wrong
I'd wish she’d tell me what it is, I’ll run and hide

Though the night ran swirling and whirling
I remember her whispering yet
But evidently she don’t, evidently she won’t
She just acts like we never have met

[Verse 5]
I’m leavin' today, I’ll be on my way
Of this I can't say very much
But if you want me to, I can be just like you
And pretend that we never have touched
And if anybody asks me
“Is it easy to forget?”
I’ll say, “It’s easily done, you just pick anyone
And pretend that you never have met!”

[Verse 1]
Lenny Bruce is dead but his ghost lives on and on
Never did get any Golden Globe award, never made it to Synanon
He was an outlaw, that’s for sure
More of an outlaw than you ever were
Lenny Bruce is gone but his spirit’s livin’ on and on

[Verse 2]
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn’t work out
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talkin’ about
Never robbed any churches nor cut off any babies’ heads
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds
He’s on some other shore, he didn’t wanna live anymore

[Verse 3]
Lenny Bruce is dead but he didn’t commit any crime
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time
I rode with him in a taxi once
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months
Lenny Bruce moved on and like the ones that killed him, gone

[Verse 4]
They said that he was sick ’cause he didn’t play by the rules
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had

[Verse 1]
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
They’re throwing knives into the tree
Two big bags of dead man’s bones
Got their noses to the grindstones

[Verse 2]
Living in the Land of Nod
Trustin’ their fate to the Hands of God
They pass by so silently
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee

[Verse 3]
Well, they’re going to the country, they’re gonna retire
They’re taking a streetcar named Desire
Looking in the window at the pecan pie
Lot of things they’d like they would never buy

[Verse 4]
Neither one gonna turn and run
They’re making a voyage to the sun
“His Master’s voice is calling me”
Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee

[Verse 5]
Tweedle-dee Dee and Tweedle-dee Dum
All that and more and then some
They walk among the stately trees
They know the secrets of the breeze

[Verse 6]
Tweedle-dee Dum said to Tweedle-dee Dee
“Your presence is obnoxious to me”
They’re like babies sittin’ on a woman’s knee
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee

[Verse 7]
Well, the rain beating down on my window pane
I got love for you and it’s all in vain
Brains in the pot, they’re beginning to boil
They’re dripping with garlic and olive oil

[Verse 8]
Tweedle-dee Dee, he’s on his hands and his knees
Saying, “Throw me somethin’, Mister, please”
“What’s good for you is good for me”
Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee

[Verse 9]
Well, they’re living in a happy harmony
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
They’re one day older and a dollar short
They’ve got a parade permit and a police escort

[Verse 10]
They’re lying low and they’re makin’ hay
They seem determined to go all the way
They run a brick-and-tile company
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee

[Verse 11]
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
And a noble truth is a sacred dream
My pretty baby, she’s lookin’ around
She’s wearin’ a multi-thousand dollar gown

[Verse 12]
Tweedle-dee Dee is a lowdown, sorry old man
Tweedle-dee Dum, he’ll stab you where you stand
“I’ve had too much of your company,”
Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
They ain’t got nothing on you
I swear them hoes ain’t got nothing on you
That nigga broke, he ain’t got nothing for you
I swear these hoes ain’t got nothing on you
I fuck with you cause you’re very loyal
And you’re so fine, you make my blood boil
I have to go and get another lawyer
She took the charge, they ain’t got nothing on her
I swear to God they ain’t got nothing on her
Huh, we in the airport, she got something on her
We ball out in the mall in California
We might just pull up in twin Californias

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
They ain’t got nothing on you
They ain’t got nothing on you
They ain’t got nothing on you
Hoes ain’t got nothing on you

She think I’m with another woman
Another woman that gonn keep me comin'
Girl, these hoes, they ain’t got nothing on you

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
It’s nothing, claim they aren't, but they bluffin'
Come home and I hit it hard, and she gives me head that’s concussion
I’m stunting, OG Kush what I’m puffin'
In the club you know me, I spend it all
My homies gon' get to bustin
Got a quarter million to spend
Just came home from tour and I crushed it
Just bought my wife a pair of glass shoes
Cause her ass thick as a pumpkin
They ain’t got nothing on her
She don’t want no other nigga, she fuckin with a stoner
And if I’m up in this bitch, then I’m prolly with the owner
Hella bottles, hella marijuana, anything you want, my niggas got it
We got liquor, we got mollies, we got bitches tryna ride, taking pictures
We just standing on the couches, they could try but

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
They ain’t got nothing on her
They ain’t got nothing on you
They ain’t got nothing on you
Hoes ain’t got nothing on you
I think that shit just paranoia
She think I’m with another woman
Another woman that gonn keep me comin'
Girl, these hoes, they ain’t got nothing on you

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I fuck with shawty cause she very loyal
We can tie the knot like Memph and Toya
I won’t ignore you and I won’t divorce you
Let's have two girls and call them Rolls and Porsche
I respect that girl, I accept that girl
I’ll do anything I can to protect that girl
If I could do it all again, would have kept that girl
But I’m unhealthy for you baby I fuck up your world
You your Daddy's lil girl, but you’s a grown lady
And I don’t see you like he see you cause we not related
We got faded at my spot, I swear we're so wasted
After the third shot of patron, I swear can’t even taste it

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
They ain’t got nothing on you
They ain’t got nothing on you
They ain’t got nothing on you
Hoes ain’t got nothing on you
I think that shit just paranoia
She think I’m with another woman
Another woman that gonn keep me comin
Girl, these hoes, they ain’t got nothing on you

Well, early in the morning
'Til late at night

But I feel alright

I’m pledgin' my time to you
Hopin' you’ll come through, too

Hopin' you’ll come through, too

[Verse 5]
Well they sent for the ambulance

Hopin' you’ll come through, too

[Pre-Chorus: Future]
I'm on that good kush and alcohol (Mike WiLL Made-It)

And all she eat is dick
She's on a strict diet, that's my baby
With no makeup, she a ten
And she the best with that head
Even better than Karrine
She don't want money
She want the time that we could spend
She said, "'Cause I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody"
Girl, I fuck who I want, and fuck who I don't
Got that A1 credit, that's that filet mignon
She said, "I never want to make you mad
I just want to make you proud"
I said, "Baby, just make me cum
Then don't make a sound"
Slick Tunechi

Uh, real nigga, fuck these haters
These hoes got pussies like craters
Can't treat these hoes like ladies, man
Pussy, money, weed, codeine
She said my dick feel like morphine
I hope my name taste like sardines to these niggas
She wake up, eat this dick
Call that breakfast in bed, 69, 96
I feel her heartbeat, I chest-to-chest with this bitch
Now turn around, face down; I'm arrestin' this bitch
Yeah, all my bitches love me, and I love all my bitches
But it's like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses
And I would say these hoes' names
But then I would be snitchin'
And these haters try to knock me
But they can't knock me off the hinges
Lil Tunechi

Long as these bitches love me

[Verse 1]
I didn't mean to treat you so bad
You shouldn't take it so personal
I didn't mean to make you so sad
You just happened to be there, that's all
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile
I thought that it was well understood
That you'd be comin' back in a little while
I didn't know that you were sayin' goodbye for good

[Chorus]
But, sooner or later, one of us must know
That you just did what you're supposed to do
Sooner or later, one of us must know
That I really did try to get close to you

[Verse 2]
I couldn't see what you could show me
Your scarf had kept your mouth well hid
I couldn't see how you could know me
But you said you knew me and I believed you did
When you whispered in my ear
And asked me if I was leavin' with you or her
I didn't realize just what I did hear
I didn't realize how young you were

[Chorus]
But, sooner or later, one of us must know
That you just did what you're supposed to do
Sooner or later, one of us must know
That I really did try to get close to you

[Verse 3]
And I couldn't see when it started snowin'
Your voice was all that I heard
I couldn't see where we were goin'
But you said you knew and I took your word
And then you told me later, as I apologized
That you were just kiddin' me, you weren't really from the farm
And I told you, as you clawed out my eyes
That I never really meant to do you any harm

[Chorus]
But, sooner or later, one of us must know
That you just did what you're supposed to do
Sooner or later, one of us must know
That I really did try to get close to you

[Verse 1]
The guilty undertaker sighs
The lonesome organ grinder cries
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you
The cracked bells and washed-out horns
Blow into my face with scorn
But it’s not that way
I wasn’t born to lose you

[Chorus]
I want you, I want you
I want you, so bad
Honey, I want you

[Verse 2]
The drunken politician leaps
Upon the street where mothers weep
And the saviors who are fast asleep, they wait for you
And I wait for them to interrupt
Me drinking from my broken cup
And ask me to
Open up the gate for you

[Chorus]
I want you, I want you
Yes I want you, so bad
Honey, I want you

[Bridge]
How my fathers, they’ve gone down
True love they’ve been without it
But all their daughters put me down
'Cause I don’t think about it

[Verse 3]
Well, I'll return to the Queen of Spades
And talk with my chambermaid
She knows that I’m not afraid to look at her
She is good to me
And there’s nothing she doesn’t see
She knows where I’d like to be
But it doesn’t matter

[Chorus]
I want you, I want you
Yes I want you, so bad
Honey, I want you

[Verse 4]
Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit
He spoke to me, I took his flute
No, I wasn’t very cute to him, was I?
But I did it, because he lied
And because he took you for a ride
Uhm, because time was on his side
And because I

[Chorus]
Want you, I want you
Yes I want you, so bad
Honey, I want you

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Oh, the ragman draws circles
Up and down the block
I'd ask him what the matter was
But I know that he don't talk
And the ladies treat me kindly
And they furnish me with tape
But deep inside my heart
I know I can't escape

[Chorus]
Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

[Verse 2]
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley
With his pointed shoes and his bells
Speaking to some French girl
Who says she knows me well
And I would send a message
To find out if she's talked
But the post office has been stolen
And the mailbox is locked

[Chorus]
Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

[Verse 3]
Mona tried to tell me
To stay away from the train line
She said that all the railroad men
Just drink up your blood like wine
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that
But then again, there's only one I've met
And he just smoked my eyelids
And punched my cigarette"

[Chorus]
Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

[Verse 4]
Grandpa died last week
And now he's buried in the rocks
But everybody still talks about
How badly they were shocked
But me, I expected it to happen
I knew he'd lost control
When I sp— he'd built a fire on Main Street
And shot it full of holes

[Chorus]
Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

[Verse 5]
Now the senator came down here
Showing everyone his gun
Handing out free tickets
To the wedding of his son
And me, I nearly got busted
And wouldn't it be my luck
To get caught without a ticket
And be discovered beneath a truck

[Chorus]
Oh, Mama
Is this really the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

[Verse 6]
Now the tea preacher looked so baffled
When I asked him why he dressed
With twenty pounds of headlines
Stapled to his chest
But he cursed me when I proved to him
Then I whispered, said, "Not even you can hide
You see, you're just like me
I hope you're satisfied"

[Chorus]
Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

[Verse 7]
Now the rainman gave me two cures
Then he said, "Jump right in"
The one was Texas medicine
The other was just railroad gin
And like a fool I mixed them
And it strangled up my mind
And now people just get uglier
And I have no sense of time

[Chorus]
Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

[Verse 8]
Now when Ruthie says come see her
In her honky-tonk lagoon
Where I can watch her waltz for free
'Neath her Panamanian moon
And I say, "Aw, come on now
You know you know about my debutante"
And she says, "Your debutante just knows what you need
But I know what you want"

[Chorus]
Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

[Verse 9]
Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
Where the neon madmen climb
They all fall there so perfectly
It all seems so well timed
And here I sit so patiently
Waiting to find out what price
You have to pay to get out of
Going through all these things twice

[Chorus]
Oh, Mama
Is this really the end?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

[Verse]
Check, I spit the flows and I got a bunch of ho's

Brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat
Well, you must tell me, baby
How your head feels under something like that
Under your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat

[Verse 2]
Well, you look so pretty in it
Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Yes, I just wanna see
If it's really the expensive kind
You know it balances on your head
Just like a mattress balances
On a bottle of wine
Your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat

[Verse 3]
Well, if you want to see the sun rise
Honey, I know where
We'll go out and see it sometime
We'll both just sit there and stare
Me with my belt wrapped around my head
And you just sittin' there
In your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you
"It's bad for your health," he said
Yes, I disobeyed his orders
I came to see you, but I found him there instead
You know, I don't mind you cheatin' on me
But I sure wish he'd take that off his head
Your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat

[Verse 5]
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend
You know, I never seen him before
Well, I saw you makin' love with him
You forgot to close the garage door
You might think he loves you for your money
But I know what he really loves you for
It's your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat

[Verse 1]
Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls

[Chorus]
She takes just like a woman, yeah she does
She makes love just like a woman, yeah she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

[Verse 2]
Queen Mary, she's my friend
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
'Til she finally sees that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls

[Chorus]
She takes just like a woman, yes
She makes love just like a woman, yeah she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

[Bridge]
Yeah, it was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what's worse
Is this pain in here
I can't stay in here

[Verse 3]
Ain't it clear that I just can't fit
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
But when we meet again, introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world

[Chorus]
Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do
You make love just like a woman, yes, you do
Then you ache just like a woman
But ya' break just like a little girl

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
You say you love me
And you're thinkin' of me
But you know you could be wrong
You say you told me
That you wanna hold me
But you know you're not that strong
I just can't do what I done before
I just can't beg you anymore
I'm gonna let you pass
And I'll go last
Then time will tell just who has fell
And who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine

[Verse 2]
You say you disturb me
And you don't deserve me
But you know sometimes you lie
You say you're shakin'
And you're always achin'
But you know how hard you try
Sometimes it gets so hard to care
It can't be this way everywhere
And I'm gonna let you pass
Yes, and I'll go last
Then time will tell who has fell
And who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine

[Bridge]
Well the, the judge he holds a grudge
He's gonna call on you
But he's badly built
And he walks on stilts
Watch out he don't fall on you

[Verse 3]
You say you're sorry
For tellin' stories
That you know I believe are true
You say you got some
Other kinda lover
And yes, I believe you do
Say my kisses are not like his
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is
I'm just gonna let you pass
Yes, and I'll go last
Then time will tell who has fell
And who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine

[Verse 1]
Standing on your window, honey
Yes, I’ve been here before
Feeling so harmless
I’m looking at your second door
How come you don’t send me no regards?

[Refrain]
You know I want your lovin'
Honey, why are you so hard?

[Verse 2]
Kneeling ’neath your ceiling
Yes, I guess I’ll be here for a while
I’m trying to read your poetry, but
I’m helpless, like a rich man’s child
How come you send someone out to have me barred?

[Refrain]
You know I want your lovin’
Honey, why you so hard?

[Bridge]
Like a poor fool in his prime
Yes, I know you can hear me walk
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime?
Or is it just solid rock?

[Verse 3]
Well, I lean into your hallway
Lean against your velvet door
I watch upon your scorpion
Who crawls across your circus floor
Just what do you think you have to guard?

[Refrain]
You know I want your lovin’
Honey, but you’re so hard

[Verse 4]
Achilles is in your alleyway
He don’t want me here, he does brag
He’s pointing to the sky
And he’s hungry, like a man in drag
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?

[Refrain]
You know I want your lovin'
Honey, but you’re so hard

[Verse 1]
Well, your railroad gate
You know I just can't jump it
Sometimes it gets so hard, you see
I just sitting here, beating on my trumpet
With all these promises you left for me
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?

[Verse 2]
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Yeah, when you knew I had some other place to be
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?

[Bridge 1]
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously
But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately

[Verse 3]
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary
But to live outside the law, you must be honest
I know you always say that you agree
Alright, so where are you tonight, sweet Marie?

[Bridge 2]
Well, I don't know how it happened
But the riverboat captain, he knows my fate
But everybody else, even yourself
They're just gonna have to wait

[Verse 4]
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets
The Persian drunkard, he follows me
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?

[Verse 5]
Well, I been in jail when all the mail showed
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
And now I stand here lookin' at your yellow railroad
In the ruins of your balcony
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie

[Verse 1]
When she said
“Don’t waste your words, they’re just lies”
I cried she was deaf
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes
And said, “What else you got left?”
Yeah, it was then that I got up to leave
But she said, “Don’t forget
Everybody must give something back
For something they get”

[Verse 2]
I stood there and hummed
I tapped on her drum I asked her "How come?"
And she buttoned her boot
And straightened her suit
Then she said, “Don’t get cute”
So I forced my hands in my pockets
And felt with my thumbs
And gallantly handed her
My very last piece of gum

[Verse 3]
She threw me outside
I stood in the dirt where everyone walked
And after finding out I’d
Forgotten my shirt
I went back and knocked
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it
And I tried to make sense
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
That leaned up against

[Verse 4]
Her Jamaican rum
And when she did come, I asked her for some
She said, “No, dear”
I said, “Your words aren’t clear
You’d better spit out your gum”
She screamed 'til her face got so red
Then she fell on the floor
And I covered her up and then
Thought I’d go look through her drawer

[Verse 5]
And when I was through
I filled up my shoe
And brought it to you
And you, you took me in
You loved me then
You never wasted time
And I, I never took much
I never asked for your crutch
Now don’t ask for mine

[Chorus]
Early in the mornin'
Early in the mornin'
I'm callin' you to
I'm callin' you to
Please come home
Yes, I could make it without you
If I just didn't feel so all alone

[Verse 1]
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
I won't let you down
I won't let you down
No, I won't
You know I can and I know a honey
But, oh, honey, please don't

[Verse 2]
I got my black dog barkin'
Black dog barkin'
Yes, he is now
Yes, he is
Outside my yard
Yes, I could tell you what he means
If I just didn't have to try so hard

[Verse 3]
Your mama's workin'
Your mama's moanin'
She's cryin', ya know
She's tryin', ya know
Ya better go now
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I
But I just don't know how

[Verse 4]
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers
And five believers
Five believers
All dressed like men
Tell your mama not to worry because
Yes, they're just my friends

[Chorus]
Early in the mornin'
Early in the mornin'
I'm callin' you to
I'm callin' you to
Please come home
Yes, I could make it without you, honey
If I just did not feel so all alone

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Come on, come on

[Verse 1]
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
And your silver cross, and your voice like chimes
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
With your pockets well protected at last
And your streetcar visions which ya place on the grass
And your flesh like silk, and your face like glass
Who could they get to carry you?

[Chorus]
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I put them by your gate?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

[Verse 2]
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
And your basement clothes and your hollow face
Who among them can think he could outguess you?
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Into your eyes where the moonlight swims
And your matchbook songs and your gypsy hymns
Who among them would try to impress you?

[Chorus]
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I put them by your gate?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

[Verse 3]
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss
And ya wouldn't know it woulda happened like this
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs
Who among them do ya think could resist you?

[Chorus]
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I leave them by your gate?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

[Verse 4]
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
How could they ever mistake you?
They wished you’d accepted the blame for the farm
But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms
How could they ever have persuaded you?

[Chorus]
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I leave them by your gate?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

[Verse 5]
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
And your magazine-husband who one day just had to go
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show
Who among them do you think would employ you?
Now you stand with your thief, you're on his parole
With your holy medallion and your fingertips now that fold
And your saintlike face and your ghost-like soul
Who among them could ever think it could destroy you?

[Chorus]
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophet say that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I leave them by your gate?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

[Instrumental Outro]

[Chorus]
Are you ready, are you ready?
Are you ready, are you ready?

[Verse 1]
Are you ready to meet Jesus?
Are you where you ought to be?
Will He know you when He sees you
Or will He say, “Depart from Me”?

[Chorus]
Are you ready, hope you’re ready
Am I ready, am I ready?
Am I ready, am I ready?

[Verse 2]
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren
And to take up my cross?
Have I surrendered to the will of God
Or am I still acting like the boss?

[Chorus]
Am I ready, hope I’m ready

[Verse 3]
When destruction cometh swiftly
And there’s no time to say a fare-thee-well
Have you decided whether you want to be
In heaven or in hell?

[Chorus]
Are you ready, are you ready?

[Verse 4]
Have you got some unfinished business?
Is there something holding you back?
Are you thinking for yourself
Or are you following the pack?

[Chorus]
Are you ready, hope you’re ready
Are you ready?

Are you ready for the judgment?
Are you ready for that terrible swift sword?
Are you ready for Armageddon?
Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Are you ready, I hope you’re ready

[Verse 1]
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed
There’s a dyin’ voice within me reaching out somewhere
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair

[Verse 2]
Don’t have the inclination to look back on any mistake
Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break
In the fury of the moment I can see the Master’s hand
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand

[Verse 3]
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay

[Verse 4]
I gaze into the doorway of temptation’s angry flame
And every time I pass that way I always hear my name
Then onward in my journey I come to understand
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand

[Verse 5]
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
In the violence of a summer’s dream, in the chill of a wintry light
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face

[Verse 6]
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea
Sometimes I turn, there’s someone there, other times it’s only me
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand

[Harmonica solo]

[Chorus]
Ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

[Verse 1]
It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
I'm thinkin' of everything that we've become
And I hate it, I thought we could make it
But I'm ready to dead this, just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures and the letters she sent
You had me thinkin' you were out with your friends
I'm so foolish, play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breakin' down
And I just can't figure out why, but this is what you said, boy

[Chorus]
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
We used to say
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

[Verse 2]
Visions in my mind of the day that we met
You showed me things that I'll never forget
Took me swimmin' in the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating, yeah
You think I'm playin' when you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses (Kisses) and my lovin' (And my lovin')
But ain't nobody better than us, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breakin' down
And I just can't figure out why you said

[Chorus]
We ride (Mmm)
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
We used to say
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

[Bridge]
I guess it's over indefinitely
But you and I know it's not that easy to let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again, hey
Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
My sweet baby, this is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out

[Chorus]
We ride (Yeah)
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

[Verse 3]
Gonna make you say, boy
I wish that you could hold me when I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to, you would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(When we ride, we ride, it's 'til the day that we die)
Boy, you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
(When we ride, we ride, it's 'til the day that we die)

[Chorus]
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
We used to say
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

[Outro]
We ride
BLACK RAGE is founded on two-thirds a person
Rapings and beatings and suffering that worsens,
Black human packages tied up in strings.
BLACK RAGE can come from all these kinds of things
Black Rage is founded on blatant denial
Squeezing economics, subsistence survival,
Deafening silence and social control.
Black Rage is founded on wounds in the soul!

When the dogs bite
When the beatings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember all these kinds of things
and then I don't fear so bad!

Black rage is founded: who fed us self-hatred
Lies and abuse, while we waited and waited
Spiritual treason, This grid and its cages
Black rage was founded on these kinds of things

Black rage is founded on draining and draining
Threatening your freedom, To stop your complaining
Poisoning your water, While they say it's raining
Then call you mad for complaining, complaining
Old time bureaucracy drugging the youth
Black rage is founded on blocking the truth,
Murder and crime, Compromise and distortion
Sacrifice, sacrifice who makes this fortune?
Greed, falsely called progress
Such human contortion,
Black rage is founded on these kinds of things
So when the dog bites
And the beatings
When I’m feeling sad
I simply remember all these kinds of things and then I don’t fear so bad

Free enterprise, is it myth or illusion?
Forcing you back into purposed confusion
Black human trafficking or blood transfusion?
Black rage is founded on these kinds of things.
Victims of violence both psyche and body
Life out of context IS living unGodly
Politics, politics
Greed falsely called wealth
Black rage is founded on denial of self!
Black human packages tied and subsistence
Having to justify your very existence
Try if you must, but you can’t have my soul
Black rage is made by unGodly control

So when the dog bites
And when the beatings
And I’m feeling so sad
I simply remember all these kinds of things
And then I don’t fear so bad

[Verse 1]
Now I'm not afraid to do the Lord's work
You said vengeance is His, but I'ma do it first
I'm gon' handle my business in the name of the law (ohh)
Now if he made you cry, oh, I gotta know
If he's not ready to die, he best prepare for it
My judgement's divine, I'll tell you who you can call
You can call

[Chorus 1]
You better call the police, call the coroner
Call up your priest, have him warn ya
Won't be no peace when I find that fool
Who did that to you, yeah
Who did that to you, my baby
Who did that to you
Gotta find that fool who did that to you

[Verse 2]
Now I don't take pleasure in a man's pain
But my wrath will come down like the cold rain
And there won't be no shelter, no place you can go
It's time to put your hands up, time for surrender
I'm a vigilante, my love's defender
You're a wanted man, here everybody knows

[Chorus 1]
You better call the police, call the coroner
Call up your priest, have him warn ya
Won't be no peace when I find that fool
Who did that to you, yeah
Who did that to you, my baby
Who did that to you
Gotta find that fool who did that to you

[Bridge]
Now he'll keep on running, but I'm closing in
I hunt him down until the bitter end
If you see me coming man, who're you gonna call?

[Chorus 2]
You better call the police, call the coroner
Call up your priest, have him warn ya
Won't be no peace when I find that fool
You better call the doctor, call the lawyer
I chased him all away to California
Did my best trying to find that fool
Who did that to you

[Chorus]
(Gooooo low)
Baby, I just wanna go low

On your sweet sweet water (water)
It's crunch time 'bout to give you that 12 play
This is the 4th quarter

[Verse 1]
Some people sit right there, and can't say what's on they minds
Some people wanna FREAK, but some are just too damn shy
But with me that's not the deal, girl I say how I feel
When I see something I like, I'm gonna keep it real
For instance you look like food (mmm), I wanna put you on my plate

Up until you make it rain, grab my ears and pull my face (tonight)

This is the 4th quarter

[Verse 2]
Now some people take their time and some people procrastinate
Some people bump and grind 'cause their with that foreplay
But it's like that cream to me, lick it and roll it baby
Sex is like dope to me, so let's get it cracking baby
For instance you look like food (food, yummy), I wanna put you on my plate (uh)
Sop you up with some biscuits and go on and eat you babe ('til you)
Up until you make it rain (rain), grab my ears and pull my face (girl)
Tonight I'll be giving you brain

[Chorus]

Girl, I wanna be sipping (sipping)
On your sweet sweet water (water)
It's crunch time 'bout to give you that 12 play
This is the 4th quarter

[Bridge]
It's like you a coach baby, put me in I goes hard
Cross it over in between, run it like a point guard
Girl, my tongue got mad handles
Come on coach and call my name
I shoot that thang and win that game
(Gooooo, low) gooooo low

[Chorus]
(On you) baby, I just wanna go low, I just wanna

This is the 4th quarter

[Verse 1]
I was addicted to you, but I didn't know it
You were afflicted by booze
You didn't show it, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Life is a velvet crowbar
Hitting you over the head
You're bleeding but you want more
"This is so like you," I said
Put yourself on back to bed

[Chorus]
You're like crack to me, I don't want to leave
I'm watching you sleep, afraid you'll stop breathing
My baby's on his eighth life, darling
Staying with him till the morning

You're like crack to me, so fun I can't see
With your golden grill, your purple dream
My baby's on his eighth life, darling
Gonna watch him till the morning

[Verse 2]
I was addicted to you, didn't wanna blow it
You were a dick with your crew
Always on the road

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You wanna touch life so hard
Why can't you give it a rest?
You're not that bright for a star
Burned yourself out, nothing left
Burned yourself out, nothing left

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Styrofoam on the microphone
Can't give it up, can't go it alone
Flame-colored paradise for you, darling
But death doesn't come with a warning

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Life is a velvet crowbar
Hitting you over the head
You're bleeding syrup amour
Bleeding to death

[Chorus]

[Outro]
My baby's on his last life, darling
Gonna stay with him till morning
My baby's on his eighth life, darling
And death doesn't come with a warning

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Well she's walking, through the clouds
With a circus mind that's running round
Butterflies and zebras
And moonbeams
And-a, fairytales
That's all she ever thinks about
Riding with the wind

[Verse 2]
When I'm sad, she comes to me
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free
It's alright, she said, it's alright
Take anything you want from me
Anything, anything
Fly on, little wing

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, little wing

Everywhere we go dawg, they knowin who we at
They knowin who we are
Bottles in the car
All I am is super star, I'm smokin a cigar
Everywhere I go dawg, my lambo is swerving
Girls say I look good, I look better in person
Swervin out the lane, smokin up the lane
Standin on that couch, in the club makin it rain
Soulja Boy go hard, bitch I'll pull your card
Niggas dissin SOD, but really ain't got heart

[Hook]

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
I didn't mean to make you hate me, (rewinding)
I didn't mean to make you hate me, (scratching)
I didn't mean to make you hate me
But I'm usin' this rap shit to make me cake-y. (rewinding)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I didn't mean to make you hate me
But I'm usin' this rap shit to make me cake-y
A lot of bullshit rappin' lately
I ain't focused on that cause I'm stackin' daily (a-huh)
Keep a good sack, could mack your lady
19 years, not one cat that play me (no)
Heard otherwise, trust. You crazy
Swagger all on some old, fuck you, pay me (fuck you)
They say the flow cocky, maybe I should fall back
Hatin' cause you not me, I say to hell with all that (all that)
I'm in this game to get my ones up (yeah )
Beast on beats, trying to teach you dumb fucks (yeah)
Think shit sweet just cause he's a young buck
I spit heat, Wiz eat you chumps up
To them I'm great for how I make songs
To you I'm probably just another nigga to hate on (damn)
But it's the hustla, Young Khalifa
I (what?) smoke so much, I love my reefa'
Why niggas so into me, fam?
Tryin' to end up missin', like the Kennedy fam
Lotta cash flow, asshole
The team gettin' cake in my state
They get rid of weight like Ricki Lake
The mixtape made this shit look real fun
Dropped Show and Prove
Now you dudes lookin' real dumb
You better run nigga (run nigga)
Run, motherfucker, run (run)
When that young motherfucker come
Before you try and bring it to this kid
Pay attention to how I do this shit
Cause it ain't easy
Dimes wan' greet me
Haters wanna heat me
Pussy ass cops wanna jail and police me, bail and release me
I'm in the air, you a couple layers underneath me
There where the streets be
And some tried, all failed to defeat me
The best without a shadow of a doubt
Knaw'm talkin 'bout?
Put my shit in stores, the hood bought them out
Who got the 'Burgh rockin' something we gotta talk about?
I show and prove

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
The kid's bars harder than a mothafucka' I ain't talkin vegetables, young, I'm an onion cutta'
And it's the hustla baby you gotta deal with me
Mad cause their shorty like ice, and try to chill with me
You at a stand still runnin' them plates, my trap team boys runnin' your face(?)
Won't try to run to the jakes(?) Yeah I'm in the whore(?) like an upper body
With two bad bitches, Wiz in the upper lobby
And we runnin' the train, it is never a, "probably"
My grind like Slim Fast, I keep the plate off me
Home boy, I been doing this since way since, and trust my hand right, cause I don't need a weight, bitch
Don't get a facelift, I lift your face prick
You heard shit, Kev ain't the one to play with, cause youngin's down to shoot at you like, " Fuck what your goons is fool."
Sounds like a fuckin' drum roll when the Uzi shoot.(brrrrat)
Pardon me, man. It's (fucking Green Lantern making noises), now that's a foul line, get some freak shots (blam)
The situation is you so impatient and you can't get it man, times a wastin'
Plus, I gotta laugh cause this is what youll never be
You just a mutt and I'm a well known pedigree
Come with a settle fee, and maybe we can talk
I'd rather strip dude and make his dumb ass walk.(?)

[Verse 1: Yukimi Nagano]
Waiting by the mailbox, by the train
Passin' by the hills 'til I hear the name
I'm looking for a saw to cut the chains in half and all I want is
Someone to rely on as thunder comes a-rolling down
Someone to rely on as the lightning comes a-staring in again

[Verse 2: 2-D]
I'll wait to be forgiven, maybe I never will
My star has left me to take the bitter pill
That shattered feeling, well, the cause of it's a lesson learned
"Just don't know if I could roll into the sea again
Just don't know if I could do it all again," she said—it's true

[Verse 3: Yukimi Nagano]
Waiting in my room, and I lock the door
I watch the coloured animals across the floor
And I'm looking from a distance and I'm listening to the whispers
And oh, it ain't the same, when you're falling out of feeling
And you're falling in and caught again
Cau-au-au-aught again

[Verse 4: 2-D]
I'm caught again in the mystery
You're by my side, but are you still with me?
The answer's somewhere deep in it, I'm sorry but you're feeling it
But I just have to tell you that I love you so much these days
Have to tell you that I love you so much these days, it's true

[Outro: 2-D, (Yukimi Nagano) & Both]
My heart is in economy
Due to this autonomy
Rolling in and caught again
Cau-au-au-aught again
Cau-au-au-aught again
(Cau-au-au-aught again)
My heart is in economy
Due to this autonomy (Cau-au-au-aught again)
Rolling in and caught again
Cau-au-au-aught again

Yeah, my swag's up riding with Kenny in the Lexis

[Bridge: Kenny Hamilton]
Oh my God, it's Bieber fever, it's everywhere
It's taking over the water, it's taking over the air streams
You can not run from it, you can not hide from it
That's why we call it Bieber fever

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I went to sleep on top of bai (I went to sleep on top of bail)l
I woke up I was high as hell (woke up I was high as hell)
Can't leave my house with out my scale (can't leave the house without)
I love the 6's but hate the 12's

30 grand I profit, I bought my girl a new pocket book (Gucci)
Gucci Mane Im overboard, I;m cookin dope in overlook
All ... I don did, all I guess Im a over crook
A jet full of dope and it just landed
This softball Im pitching to ya underhanded
Buy drop tops in the winter time, cause I'm on Miami beach
Eating good like its dinner time, dime with two Miami freaks

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Future]
Jimmy Christian, Gucci, Louie, tell me which one I should do
Black Puerto Rican white tell me which one I should screw
Presidential roley bright, all em off what can ya do?
.. coming up my beak pieces man I'm super cool
The bets came in, the white came in, the pistol came in, the molly too
Astronaut they a rockstar, man Im so confused
I'm outta place, Im on the Earth
Drop a duece, whip it first
Break a fo', do it now
Remote controllin on my turf
5 star Macdonalds, man Im drinkin out the funnel
With Chanel or emilio which one Im give me baby mama
I just call me a negro, coming out of Follies
Michael ... Im hit em with that counterfeit
Or keep it a thousan eh...

[Hook]

[Intro: Timbaland]
1, 2, 1, 2

Everybody hands up in the air
1, 2, 1, 2
Let me see your drinks up in the air
1, 2, 1, 2

[First Verse: Timbaland]
It's that modern day Tony Stark, biggest dog in the game with the biggest bark
Money, money, money, money don't make the man
Man make the money with the biggest master plan

Raising bottles in the air, the money they throwing up
Peep my, peep my, peep my, peep my, peep my game boy
When it's all said and done I'm hall of fame boy

With my business partner, nah, not White Wed french folks

Be in the clubs and radio all on one command
Now show your hands

[Hook: T-Pain]
Okay (okay), let's get it jumping (let's get it jumping)

Put your hands in the air move'm up and down (down)
Hey (hey), give me a bottle and a fucking cup
Fuck that cup, I'm about to turn that bottle up
Cause I cam here to party, pass that cup around (round)
Put your hands in the air move'm up and down (down)
Oohwoah

[2nd Verse: Lil Wayne]
I heard somebody said he wasn't dead yet
They should've never said that
Young Tunechi got the game down Pat Sajak
Even though I'm paid in full, all I want is Payback
Man, fuck these niggas. Pause
I spray king kill the world and fuck them all in my cigars
I make them mother fuckers bow down, no applause
All of my goons wired up like broken jaws
I rep that mother fucking red flag put you in a dead bag
I get bread you get the crumbs at the bottom of the bread bag
And my letters is Y M, shout out Stunna and Slim
I'm fucking with Tim and my girl, I'm fucking her friend
Tunech!

[Hook]

[3rd Verse: Missy Elliott]
This country bitch from Virginia
See the way the crowd go wild when Misdemeanor 'bout to enter
Everybody better bow down when I step up to the mic; front and center
Say I'm too old to rap, I'll be rapping til I wear dentures
Yeah, hello haters
You mad? Pick your chin up
What did I say about running your mouth? You better respect your mentors
I'm so relentless flow colder than the winters
I'm pretty in the face and I should pose for a pin-up (I drink my gin up)
I'm on the mic, I'm back with Tim
We looking good like working out up in the gym
Anybody wanna see us? Competition? We don't see'm
Ain't nothing change, we ahead of the game above the rim
This how we do it

[Hook]

[Outro: Timbaland]

[Verse 1]
Tell me you won't ever give up
She owns my love
But I've got her now

[Hook]
She's alright
I'm alright
We're alright
We can't go back

[Verse 2]
Say that you'll always remind me
'Cause I can't decide
If you are my love
I know I can't always be home, but
I never left
Don't think like that

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Tell me you won't ever give up
She owns my love
But I've got her now

[Hook]
She's alright
I'm alright

'Cause I can't decide

I know I can't always be home, but
I never left
Don't think like that

[Hook]
She's alright
I'm alright
We're alright
We can't go back

[Verse 1]
She said, "I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad"
And she's making me feel like I've never been born

[Verse 2]
I said, "who put all those things in your head?
Things that make me feel that I'm mad
And you're making me feel like I've never been born"

[Bridge]
She said, "you don't understand what I've said"
I said, "no, no, no, you're wrong"
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

[Verse 3]
I said, "even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born"

[Bridge]
She said, "you don't understand what I said"
I said, "no, no, no, you're wrong"
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

[Verse 4]
I said, "even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born"

[Outro]
She said, "I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
I know what it's like to be dead"

[Verse 1]
I wanna make you want me
Won't you take it in
Don't try to look in my eyes
At the light
They weren't meant to hold you
The sheets are pushed
You gave me words to hold onto
So I'll just have to make this for me

[Hook]
I wanna make my life your life
I'll wake up with you and I'll give you rides
It don't matter if it's cold outside
Doesn't matter if it's day or night
Ooh

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
We were kids acting way too old
Hidden somewhere in the back room
Now we got it and it's just us
Now I, wanna, keep it, forever

[Instrumental break]

[Hook]
I wanna make my life your life
I'll wake up with you and I'll give you rides
It don't matter if it's cold outside
Doesn't matter if it's day or night

I wanna make my life your life
I'll wake up with you and I'll give you rides
It don't matter if it's cold outside
Doesn't matter if it's day or night

[Chorus]
How’s it wrong, when I want it, she’s someone I can't have?
I’m pleased to get you now, a moment felt too short
Even though I was the cause, even though I made you cry
Even though that time was lost, I know it can be made up

[Verse 1]
You doubted, you relied on a situation
Your voice coming through the line, you’re not exactly by my side
It’s all a blur, and I know it can sound made up
Tell me where we are, I don’t wanna beat myself up

[Refrain]
Month over, two over, don’t see my days tonight
Plus you didn’t even let me know
I’m not countin' but we got three shows
Month, two over, don’t see my days tonight
Pause it out, then let me know
I’m not counting, but we got two shows

[Chorus]
How’s it wrong, when I want it, she’s someone I can't have?
I’m pleased to get you now, a moment felt too short
Even though I was the cause, even though I made you cry
Even though that time was lost, I know it can be made up

[Refrain]
Month over, two over, don’t see my days tonight
Plus you didn’t even let me know
I’m not countin' but we got three shows
Month over, two over, don’t see my days tonight
Pause it out, then let me know
I’m not countin' but we got two shows

[Chorus]
How’s it wrong, when I want it, she’s someone I can't have?
I’m pleased to get you now, a moment felt too short
Even though I was the cause, even though I made you cry
Even though that time is lost, I know it can be made up
How’s it wrong, when I want it, she’s someone I can't have?
I’m pleased to get you now, a moment felt too short
Even though I was the cause, even though I made you cry
Even though that time is lost, I know it can be made up

[Verse 1]
I think I let my mind go wild
And I think I'm on the verge of crying
It's the fact I'm not closer
To letting anyone inside my life

At least I think I tell her
When trouble worries me
And the questions never matter
When it turns out just to be nothing

[Hook]
I don't know
Why I think
I gave myself away
I don't know
Why I think
I gave myself away
I don't know
Why I think
I gave myself away
I don't know
Why I think
I gave myself away

[Verse 2]
I may not have it down
The night is young enough
Pick a place you want to go
Doesn't matter if it's open or closed

Funny that you picked me out
Didn't think I was your type
I can't imagine wondering
What it's like, to have you out my life

[Hook]
I don't know
Why I think
I gave myself away
I don't know
Why I think
I gave myself away
I don't know
Why I think
I gave myself away
I don't know
Why I think
I gave myself away

[Hook]
She knows
I'mma be her boy forever
And she knows
I'm gonna have it all or better
I can't be going up to this girl, no
When I look at her she's all I wanted
She's got my back and I know it
She only does it 'cause she loves it

[Verse 1]
She knows
I work hard
Says she's gotta stress it too
I can't pick a fight with you
I recognize you're on my side
I'm out while she's stuck in class
Call me daily just to say you hate it
What's the point of calling
When all I get is nothing

[Verse 2]
She goes
Through it all
If she wasn't by herself
I'm the one that needs her help
Or we can go by in days
She's out while I'm busy playing
But they shouldn't really call it playing
So why do I still go
If it's not for long

[Hook]
She knows
I'mma be her boy forever
And she knows
I'm gonna have it all or better
I can't be going up to this girl, no
When I look at her she's all I wanted
She's got my back and I know it
She only does it 'cause she loves it

[Verse 3]
When you
Talk about
How your room shakes at night
I wonder if it's bad that I'm
Taking photos with a friend of mine
We don't gotta fake these smiles
I don't wanna waste your time
(I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna waste your time)

[Hook]
She knows
I'mma be her boy forever
And she knows
I'm gonna have it all or better
I can't be going up to this girl, no
When I look at her she's all I wanted
She's got my back and I know it
She only does it because she loves it
She knows
I'mma be her boy forever
And she knows
I'm gonna have it all or better
I can't be going up to this girl, no
When I look at her she's all I wanted
She's got my back and I know it
She only does it because she loves it

[Verse 1]
I'm alright
Out here with you
It doesn't bother me
I know you think it does
It's us making grown up calls
You got more than my love

[Verse 2]
You only talk
You won't bite
I can't kiss her
So I
I move over, but
It's not enough
It's what I want
To me it's fine
But I know
I keep it to myself
I don't want
To have it all
All on the floor
Like everything
You see me too
It's not my fault

[Hook]
It's not so common for it to
Turn out wrong
Ohh
It's not so common for it to
Turn out wrong
I'll always be by you
I don't want you thinking
I'll miss you

[Verse 3]
I know it's hard
To be alone
You gotta stay
While I'm gone
I'm in a different state
Another job
I didn't call
I'm so far

[Hook]
It's not so common for it to
Turn out wrong
Ohh
It's not so common for it to
Turn out wrong
I'll always be by you
I don't want you thinking
I'll miss you

[Verse 1]
You and me
Can be what we want to be
Don't you let
This come falling down on me

I can hold
It in my arms
And I don't expect
Anything in return

[Hook]
We'll be living high
Living
We'll be getting up when we're down
And the big one's coming
We'll be living high
Living
We'll be giving up when we're down
And the big one's coming

[Verse 2]
We'll be living high
We'll be living low
I can't give it either way
I don't think I know

I don't care at all
You can take me now
You can take me then
Doesn't matter if you fall

She'll be living high
She'll be living low
She can give it either way
I don't think she knows

She don't care at all
You can take her now
You can take her then
Doesn't matter if she falls

She'll be living low
We'll be living low

[Hook]
We'll be living high
Living
We'll be getting up when we're down
And the big one's coming
We'll be living high
Living
We'll be giving up when we're down
And the big one's coming

[Hook]
Ah, I am used
You really need me there
I can't be so naive about you
See, lied just to watch you fake
Could be the counterparts
Never liked to study much, but you
You have the will
Yes you, yes you do
Yes you, yeah you are
Yes you should because you are
Yes you, yes you do
Yes you, yeah you are
Yes you should because you are

[Verse]
Why is she still sleeping?
I wish she'd explain
The family's busy stressin'
About where you are
I guess it's just a habit
To have sense that things are fragile
It's the warmth inside your bag
If I hadn't spent the night with you
I don't think we'll ever make this through
Ah, I will...

[Hook]
Ah, I am used
You really need me there
I can't be so naive about you
See, lied just to watch you fake
Could be the counterparts
Never liked to study much, but you
You have the will
Yes you, yeah you do
Yes you, yeah you are
Yes you should because you are
Yes you, yeah you do
Yes you, yeah you are
Yes you should because you are

[Outro]
Hope you're not awake
Biting at your nails
Worried bout the class
That you think you failed

[Verse 1]
I wish I could be there
See you everyday
I don't have to call you

[Verse 2]
I don't have a lot
But you got to see my light
Let me show you where I go at night

[Verse 3]
Do you think we did it right?
You weren't lying when you said "Just wait
'Til you live with someone someday"

[Refrain]
Some days slip by me
And I think I know why
I'll make it through

[Bridge]
It's imperfect
It's not forever
That you're further
You're still patient

[Refrain]
Some days slip by me
And I think I know why
I'll make it through

[Produced by Toro y Moi]

Some had it too well
Some had it not enough
The room is empty
Fill it with stone
Some had it too well
Some had it not enough
The room is empty
Fill it with stone

Some had it too well
Some had it not enough
The room is empty
Fill it with stone

[Verse 1]
So tell again
Don't let it in
'Cause I feel weak, uh-huh
'Cause I feel weak, uh-huh

[Verse 2]
Your tender mind
It's just like mine
Because I feel weak, uh-huh
'Cause I feel weak, uh-huh

[Verse 3]
And if I fall
Into the sea
Don't let me go
'Cause I feel weak

And if I fall
Into the sea
Don't let me go
'Cause I feel weak
Uh-huh
Uh-huh

[Outro]
(I feel weak, uh-huh)

[Verse 1]
Don't let me hold you down
We could be there now
And I'd rather drive it through the night
It's only one more day
Til we leave this state
And I know she thinks I've changed my mind
Don't let me hold you down
We could be there now
And I'd rather drive it through the night
It's only one more day
Til we leave this state
And I know she thinks I've changed my mind
Don't let me hold you down
We could be there now
And I'd rather drive it through the night
It's only one more day
Til we leave this state
And I know she thinks I've changed my mind

[Verse 2]
Don't let me hold you down
We could be there by now
It's only one more day
Until we leave this state
And I know she thinks I've changed my mind
Don't let me hold you down
We could be there by now
It's only one more day
Til we leave this state
And I know she thinks I'll change my mind
Don't let me hold you down
We could be there by now

[Bridge]
Cause you know me
And I know you too
And that's not like me
Let me hold you tonight
Cause you know me
And I know you too
And that's not like me
Let me hold you tonight
Cause you know me
And I know you too
And that's not like me
Let me hold you tonight
Cause you know me
And I know you too
And that's not like me
Let me hold you tonight

[Refrain]
Let me hold you tonight
Let me hold you tonight

[Verse 1]
Ring, my friend I said you'd call
Doctor Robert
Day or night he'll be there any time at all
Doctor Robert

[Chorus 1]
Doctor Robert
You're a new and better man
He helps you to understand
He does everything he can
Doctor Robert

[Verse 2]
If you're down he'll pick you up
Doctor Robert
Take a drink from his special cup
Doctor Robert

[Chorus 2]
Doctor Robert
He's a man you must believe
Helping anyone in need
No one can succeed like
Doctor Robert

[Bridge]
Well, well, well, you're feeling fine
Well, well, well, he'll make you
Doctor Robert

[Verse 3]
My friend works for the National Health
Doctor Robert
You'll pay money just to see yourself
With Doctor Robert

[Chorus 1]
Doctor Robert
You're a new and better man
He helps you to understand
He does everything he can
Doctor Robert

[Bridge]
Well, well, well, you're feeling fine
Well, well, well, he'll make you
Doctor Robert

[Outro]
Ring, my friend I said you'd call
Doctor Robert
Ring, my friend I said you'd call
Doctor Robert
Doctor Robert

[Verse 1]
I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words, they seem to slip away

[Verse 2]
When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
It's all right
I'll make you maybe next time around

[Bridge 1]
But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusing things

[Verse 3]
I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time

[Bridge 2]
Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe you'd understand

[Verse 3]
I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time

[Outro]
I've got time
I've got time

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
With stars to fill my dreams
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
Sit with elders of the gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed

[Verse 2]
Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 3]
Ooh, baby, I been flying
No, yeah, mama, there ain't no denying
Oh, ooh, yeah I've been flying
Mama, mama, ain't no denying, no denying

[Verse 4]
Oh, all I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find, where I've been

[Verse 5]
Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Here is the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin' through Kashmir

[Verse 6]
Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
Ooooh

[Verse 7/Outro]
Oh, when I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah
When I see, when I see the way, you stay, yeah
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, but I'm down, so down
Ooh, my baby, ooh, my baby, let me take you there
Oh, come on, come on, oh, let me take you there, let me take you there
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, let me take you there, let me take you there

["Old Time's Sake" by Eminem plays in the background]

[Receptionist]
Mr. Berman?

[Steve Berman]
What?

[Receptionist]
We have Eminem here to see you

[Steve Berman & Eminem]
About fuckin' time! Send him in
Steve! Good to see ya, man. Um, hey, I just w–
Well, look who decided to show his face! I hope you've had fun in the last four years!
Look man, I apologize again for–
For shooting me?! Do you know I lost the use of my right arm?
Again, it was a mistake, a terrible mist–
Are you wearing a bulletproof vest?
And then you go and do what? Hide out? Stay in Detroit for almost five years while the music industry melts the fuck down?
Do you know how many people lost their jobs because of your fuckin' vacation?
Well, that's actually why I'm here: I was gonna put out some new music, and I wanted to play it for you and get your opinion
Do I really need to hear it? Let me guess, another album about: "Poor me! I'm so famous that it's ruined my rich little life and I'm such a tortured artist, let me make music about it and my tragic love life!" Am I on to something here?
Come on, man, it's not like that...
You know what? Just hand the fuckin' thing over! I'm done talkin to you! Think you can just come and go as you please, big selfish superstar?
Steve, I had a drug problem!
"Oh, poor me! I had a drug problem!" Who hasn't had a drug problem in this town? You know what? (*gun cocks*)
Hey! hey!
Just lay the shit down on my desk and get the fuck out!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Jesus Christ, man, alright, alright, here, fine...
What's this shit? Two CDs?
That's what I've been tryin' to tell you, man, there's two albums
Just get out!
Alright!
Get the fuck out!
Alright, man, see you later
(*bottle smashes*)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ugh, AK on my nightstand, right next to that Bible
But I swear, with these fifty shots, I'll shoot it out with Five-O
Pockets gettin' too fat, no Weight Watchers, no lipo
Money talks, bullshit walks on a motherfucking tightrope
And I make that pussy tap out, I knock that pussy out cold
Nigga, you get beat the crap out, but that's just how the dice roll
These hoes want that hose-pipe, so I give all these hoes pipe
She get on that dick and stay on, all night, like porch lights
Let's do it, fuck talking, we out here, we ballin'
And I'm spraying at these rusty niggas like WD-40
We fucked up, we Truk'd up; no if, ands, or butt-fucks
Bitch niggas go behind your back like nunchucks, and that's fucked up
But my hoes down, my cups up, my niggas down for whatever
These bitches think they're too fly, well, tell them hoes I pluck feathers
I'm Tunechi, Young Tunechi, I wear Trukfit, fuck Gucci
She blowing kisses at me with her pussy lips, smooches
And that's 2 Chainz

[Chorus: 2 Chainz, Lil Wayne & Both]
Look at you (Aw), now look at us
All my niggas look rich as fuck (Yeah)
All my niggas live rich as fuck (Yeah)
All—All my niggas look rich as fuck (Yeah)
Look at you (Look at you), now look at us (Now look at us)
All my niggas look rich as fuck (Bitch)
All my—All my niggas live rich as fuck (You hoe-ass bi—)
All my—All—All my ni—

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Ugh, never talk to the cops, I don't speak Pig Latin
I turned a penny to a motherfuckin Janet Jackson
Tell the bitches that be hatin' I ain't got no worries
I just want to hit and run like I ain't got insurance, ho
What's your name? What's your sign? Zodiac Killer
All rats gotta die, even Master Splinter
Yeah, murder, one-eighty-seven
I be killing them bitches, I hope all dogs go to heaven
And I got Xanax, Percocet, promethazine with codeine
Call me Mr. Sandman, I'm sellin' all these hoes dreams
Got a white girl with big titties, flat-ass, TV screen
I keep a bad bitch, call me "The B.B. King"
And you know I got that mouth out her
Then put that bitch out like a house fire
I'm killing these hoes like Michael Myers
I eat that cat just like a lion
And I can't trust none of these niggas
Can't trust none of these hoes
And I see your girl when I want
I got that ho TiVo'd, ugh
Got a red-ass bitch with a red-ass pussy
Nigga try me, that's a dead-ass pussy
Since y'all motherfuckers so blind to the fact
To tell you the truth, I don't care who's lookin'
All I know is I love my bitch
And pussy feel just like Heaven on Earth
Six feet deep, dick shovelin' the dirt
RIP: Rest In Pussy
Light that shit, then pass that shit, we gon' get so smoked out
And then I went, got locked up; every night, I dreamt I broke out
One time for them pussy niggas—that's that shit I don't like
We eatin' over here, nigga—fuck around and have a food fight
And that's 2 Chainz

[Chorus: 2 Chainz, Lil Wayne & Both]
Look at you (Uh), now look at us (Yeah)
All my niggas look rich as fuck (What?)
All my niggas live rich as fuck (What?)
All-all my niggas look rich as fuck (Yeah)
Look at you, now look at us (Get the fuck out y'all bitches, straight up)
All my niggas look rich as fuck (Any bitch who don't wanna give me no pussy)
All my-all my niggas live rich as fuck (Fuck you in your asshole, bitch)
All my-all-all my niggas look rich as fuck

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And your nigga a hoe

[Verse 1]
You tell me that you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me
You don't get me

[Verse 2]
You say you've seen seven wonders
And your bird is green
But you can't see me
You can't see me

[Bridge 1]
When your prized possessions
Start to weigh you down
Look in my direction
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round

[Instrumental]

[Bridge 2]
When your bird is broken
Will it bring you down?
You may be awoken
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round

[Verse 3]
You tell me that you've heard every sound there is
And your bird can swing
But you can't hear me
You can't hear me

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Each day just goes so fast
I turn around, it's past
You don't get time to hang a sign on me

[Refrain 1]
Love me while you can
Before I'm a dead old man

[Verse 2]
A lifetime is so short
A new one can't be bought
But what you've got means such a lot to me

[Refrain 2]
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

[Interlude]

[Refrain 2]
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

[Verse 3]
There's people standing round
Who'll screw you in the ground
They'll fill you in with all their sins you'll see

[Refrain 3]
I'll make love to you
If you want me to

[Verse 1]
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)

[Chorus 1]
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping

[Verse 2]
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (There's no need)

[Chorus 2]
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all, I'm only sleeping

[Break]

[Bridge]
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

[Verse 3]
Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling

[Backwards Guitar Solo: George Harrison]

[Chorus 2]
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all, I'm only sleeping

[Break: John Lennon, Paul McCartney]
Yawn, Paul!
*Yawns*

[Bridge]
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

[Verse 1]
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)

[Chorus 1]
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping

[Chorus]
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

[Verse 1]
I need to laugh, and when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about
I feel good, in a special way
I'm in love and it's a sunny day

[Chorus]
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

[Verse 2]
We take a walk, the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground

[Chorus]
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

[Verse 3]
Then we lie, beneath a shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good, she knows she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine

[Chorus]
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

[Intro]
To lead a better life I need my love to be here

[Verse 1]
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

[Verse 2]
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Bridge]
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

[Verse 3]
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

[Bridge]
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

[Verse 3]
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

[Outro]
I will be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere

[Verse 1: Ringo Starr]
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

[Verse 2: Ringo Starr]
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

[Chorus: Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

[Verse 3: Ringo Starr]
And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

[Chorus: Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Full steam ahead, Mister Boatswain, full steam ahead
Full steam ahead it is, Sergeant
Cut the cable! Drop the cable!
Aye-aye, sir, aye-aye
Captain! Captain!

[Verse 4: Ringo Starr & John Lennon]
As we live a life of ease
Every one of us (Every one of us) has all we need (Has all we need)
Sky of blue (Sky of blue) and sea of green (Sea of green)
In our yellow (In our yellow) submarine (Submarine, ha-ha!)

[Chorus: Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

[Verse 1]
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

[Verse 2]
You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again, for I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day

[Refrain]
Got to get you into my life

[Verse 3]
What can I do, what can I be?
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true, I'll never leave
And if I do, I know the way there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

[Refrain]
Got to get you into my life

[Break]

[Chorus]
I've got to get you into my life

[Outro]
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
And suddenly I see you
Did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

[Verse 1]
I was recently rid of a man again
So I caught me a cab to see Flanagan
I told the cabbie "the alley in back"
I told myself coming would keep me intact
Flanny shouts from the second floor
As I crossed the lot to the kitchen door
I see Guillermo and give him some lip
And I cross to the bar, Ellen pours me a nip
And I look to the stage it's the rock of rage as Jon is on
And how could I listen without wanting to be with them
And how could I have thought that I was ever alone?

[Chorus]
I feel like singing and drinking and stuff
And I don't wanna care if I stumble or cry
Handle me like family and that'll be enough
To keep me from dying when I want to die

[Post-Chorus]
When over the rainbow's too far
Go to Lar, go to Lar, go to Largo
When over the rainbow's too far
Go to Lar, go to Lar, go to Largo

[Verse 2]
I'm hopping scotches with Loretta and Bob
But barely containing my rapturous song
Jon's calling names here like Santa's reindeer
On Palmer on Leisz on Sarah on Sean
I love watching the Watkins when they're rocking with Garza
I want to be part of the band though
And when Mr. Tench is on the bench
I want to be the piano

[Chorus]
I feel like singing and drinking and stuff
And I don't wanna care if I stumble or cry
Handle me like family and that'll be enough
To keep me from dying when I want to die

[Post-Chorus]
When over the rainbow's too far
Go to Lar, go to Lar, go to Largo
When over the rainbow's too far
Go to Lar, go to Lar, go to Largo

[Chorus]
Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down

[Verse 1]
Oh, I'll never know
What makes this man, with all the love that his heart can stand
Dream of ways to throw it all away

[Chorus]
Woah, woah
Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down

[Verse 2]
Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees

[Guitar Solo]

[Repeat Verse 2]
Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees

[Chorus]
Woah, woah
Gravity, stay the hell away from me
Woah, woah
Gravity has taken better men than me
Now, how can that be?

[Outro]
Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where, now, keep me where the light is

[Verse 1: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher, leave them kids alone
Hey! Teacher! Leave them kids alone!

[Chorus: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
All in all, it's just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall

Wrong, do it again! (*Children playing*)
Wrong, do it again!
If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!

How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?

You! Yes! You behind the bike sheds! Stand still, laddie!

When you're fin'ly gettin' paid everything be feelin' great
Went from diggin' in the crates to chillin', gettin' faded (Faded)
Don't live a normal life, but I hope you can relate

Coolin' at the crib, can't believe it's where I live
Can't believe this what I'm doin', can't believe I got this big (Big)
Can't believe this what I'm drivin', can't believe this what I'm wearin'
Yeah, the Benz is pretty cool, but I need me a McLaren
When you see me out in public, dap me up, say, "What's good?" (What's good?)
Don't need to take a picture, it's better if you look (Look)
Going for your Queen, give a fuck about a rook
Papa was a player; took some pages from his book (All the time)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
To the seven telly and it's peanut butter jelly (Jelly)
Chillin' with the homies, smoking weed and watching Belly (Belly)
Headed to the deli, rollin' with some Pirelli's
Now I'm gettin' money like 2001 Nelly (Woo)
They wanna take my photo (Photo,) my finger in my nose though
Dutch's from the Cogos, playin' water polo
Above the ozone, young Han Solo
You start rapping and I'm like no no no no no, no
Do you get it? Tell me, can you feel it? (Feel it)
I'm only gonna get a bottle from you if you steal it (Steal it)

[Chorus: Alex Turner]
I don't ever want to hate you
So don't show me your bed
The only roads are cul-de-sacs
The first thing that she said

[Verse 1: Alex Turner]
Temptation greets you like your naughty mate
The one that used to get you in bother
But one you could never bring yourself to hate
And she said we've got that spark
But only lights a fuse, helps you see in the dark
But it's a sight you'll lose when
The temptation greets you like your naughty friend

[Chorus: Alex Turner]
I don't ever want to hate you
So don't show me your bed
The only roads are cul-de-sacs
The only ends are dead

[Verse 2: Alex Turner]
Temptation greets you like your naughty mate
The one that made you steal and set things on fire
The one you haven't seen of late
And I said that kind of talk
Only adds intrigue to the cauldron of thought
It's already exceeding
Temptation, the very thing that held her back

[Chorus: Alex Turner]
I don't ever want to hate you
So don't show me your bed
The only roads are cul-de-sacs
The only ends are dead
I don't ever want to hate you
It's not part of the plan
So keep your charm where I can't see it
And your hands where I can

[Verse 3: Dizzee Rascal]
Yo, it's Rasc' gettin' dirtee stankin', yeah
We used to be in tight, me and my naughty friends
Caused pure madness in the end, I mean day and night
We robbed, we stole, we loved to fight
Smoking, drinking, drag riding
Drugs, thugs, not law-abiding
Reckless youngsters, no direction, no sign of correction
But then I switched it off, changed my ways
Run the area like, "Oh, my days"
But a lot of my naughty friends, they're not phased
Can't believe that this music pays
See no reason why we can't do
All the things that we've always done
Still in my heart I know that's just one
But it's hard to fight the temptation, son

[Pre-Chorus: Alex Turner]
The panic will fall down around you
If you don't do what I say

[Chorus: Alex Turner]
I don't ever want to hate you
So don't show me your bed
The only roads are cul-de-sacs
The only ends are dead
I don't ever want to hate you
It's not part of the plan
So keep your charm where I can't see it
And your hands where I can

[Verse 1 : Action Bronson]
Marijuana Bronson
Yo, The land fertile I provide for the biz
Play possum with the pigs stuff a dime on the kid
Just scripted for the brothers holding knives on they bids
Gift basket full of figs, I'm sipping wine with the fizz
I got that pure smoke, gorgeous like a sushi plate
Five sticks of marijuana I hallucinate
The tan Timothy, jacket to my knee
Classic I'm a G, I'm the captain of the sea
See, It be those kids from queens in guess jeans
Pulling bread schemes smooth as jet streams that let the lead scream
We still rhyme fly words over percussion
Nine - five Style max out diamonds in Flushing
I'm still the man immoral Its hard to navigate through coral
Your bitch with the tits still give the slamming oral
Zero Fifty Six used to be the beeper code
You know the dope'll force a fiend into the sleeper hold
You mother fucker I got you

[Verse 2 : Action Bronson]
Ay yo, Mountains are capped with snow though it's the summer months
I'm working hard for that money laundered in other fronts
Forty blunts in the museum
Jerk chicken patties out the window cop the tyson out the coliseum
A Street Fighter with the Killer Instinct for Mortal Kombat
The title holder higher than a giant's shoulder
Lamb roasting over open fire
Full moon hallucinations giving in to all my souls desire
Lyrically, I'm Doctor Lector, You Doctor Seuss
I let him fall from off the roof and now I got the juice
I'm on that one way path headed for nowhere
Frozen nose hairs all I know, better be dro there
Pass the Thyme, chocking off the truest reefer
Lawrence Taylor in his prime with the smoother Caesar
Drinking ginger out the Yankee cup
The holy grail telling tale blowing cheeba eating tangy duck

[Verse 3 : Action Bronson]
Mother Fucker, Queens
These are the vividries of life that I'm expressing to you
Smoke salmon or coke famine your friend'll do you
Cause you make a little paper but you acting greedy
They'll cook ya momma in front of you just like hibachi Peaty
There's no Tahiti, forty five scrolls in graffiti
Beamers on BBs, the shit only seen on the TV
It really happened in the galaxy of Queens
Giving credit you indebted off the fallacies of fiends
I walk a road less traveled, push the foreign car
Often spark steel and known to play the gun guitar
The drugs sell by themselves you just a common factor
Real star is in the jar you the supporting actor
Blood thirsty so I'm howling at the moon
Puff a pound of boom, marijuana, she met a valid doom
We gotta get it cause we living for the minute
Keep the windows tinted, smoke in the whip, keepin it lemon scented

[Verse 1]
(Harlem)
Yeah, yo
Yo, yo, yo, uh uh
I'm a pretty motherfucker
Comin' from Harlem
New York City
Y'all know I got 'em
And I come through and I'm fuckin' all the females, in France
My shirt say Pigalle, I don't give a fuck about the fuckin' weed smell
But you know I get clothes off retail
Yeah we go and I'm sittin' on this sprewell
They don't really wanna with my fuckin' D-12 ass
And I got the style, got cash
You already know you in the present to the past
Goin' too fast, future I'll shoot ya
Hit 'em with a Ruger, uh
Now we in France, now we in Pari'
Tell that bitch trick or treat, better smell my feet
Give me something good to eat, see her in a weeks
Niggas know we get it and I'm chillin' in a suite
Uh, ow-ow-ow and shout out to my peeps
And I keep 'bout 10, 5 bad freaks
Yeah, my music leak
So loud that the shit get tweak
Loud pack, loud pack, tell me where you loud at?
And you know I got that motherfuckin' A$AP tat
On a fuckin' stomach, tell 'em quit the ruckus
I don't give a fuck, my niggas in public, thuggin'
Pants saggin', what's happenin'
Harlem world money making fucking Manhattan
You already know where I come from, nigga
You already know what the gun do, nigga
You don't really wanna with my whole crew, nigga
What you wanna do, what you wanna do, nigga?
Got a bad bitch, light skin, fair skin
You already know I had it since age 10
And I got a bad bitch from 15
And she gave me a kiss when she was 16, sweet 16
Spit sweet sixteens
And I come through something's missing
Five chains, gold chains, no diamond in it
And I got a big Rove no climbin' in it
Range Rover, chains low, then change lanes
And I got the same thing, we the chain gang
A-Gang, A$AP, what's happenin'
Dre, see ya later
Niggas know I get the paper
Never come through, you a hater
Motherfuckers wanna see me but I get darker than Vader
You outta style walkin' like Luke, I shoot
All about the Nuke
Give me the loot, give me the loot
Biggie Smalls down to my drawers
Tell 'em "Suck my balls"
Bitches just be hoarse
(Yeah) I don't even have a floor
And I made a couple mill, one tour
Niggas know me, I be comin' to your door with that shimmy shimmy ya
Put the pump to ya jaw, uh
Motherfucker give it to ya raw
Now put the kids all on the floor
Little bastards, send 'em in a casket
And I'm gon' blast it
Fucking ratchet, I'm a bastard
Hit 'em in a motherfuckin' cabbage
And I switch ya wig
I'm a disrespectful kid
Yeah, comin' from the H
Uh, say it to yo face, A$AP

[Verse 2]
Oh, so they say that I'm a a-hole
Ain't that about my peso?
Bad bitches on my payroll
Don't move 'less I say so
Hit you with that TEC-9, better step back
I'm a Harlem motherfucker and I'm drippin' purple swag
Sittin' here in France, yea we in 'Pari
Tell that bitch to kiss my feet she said 'Oh, you so sweet'
I said I never go to sleep, get money every week
Yesterday I bought a Range, and today I'mma get a Jeep
Okay I said my name is Rocky
I'm probably in Versace
Like whoa Kimosabe
And can't nobody stop me
Hey mami I'm your papi
My sneaks probably ?
And now I wear the Jordans
But now I'm in Givenchy
Okay Rocky what's your name, what's your name, what's your gang?
A$AP, A-S-A-P and that shit don't mean the same as
As Soon As Possible, tell me if you logical
Make 3 mill off one deal now, 10 mill's what I'm 'bout to do
Niggas know it's like Mountain Dew, sippin' on that Sizzurp
Purple drank I get it, I'm fuckin' with the Wizards
That's word to my grands, that's word to my mother
You know who I be, that pretty motherfucker

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm running down the road tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on my mind
Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me
One says she's a friend of mine

[Chorus 1]
Take It easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can
Don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand and take it easy

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm a standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona
And such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me

[Chorus 2]
Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
We may lose, and we may win
Though we will never be here again
So open up, I'm climbin' in
So take it easy

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well, I'm running down the road trying to loosen my load
Got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover
She's so hard to find

[Chorus 3]
Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy
Come on baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me

[Outro]
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Oh, we got it easy
We oughta take it easy

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange

[Chorus 1: Paul McCartney with John Lennon & George Harrison]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

[Piccolo trumpet solo]

[Chorus 2: Paul McCartney with John Lennon & George Harrison]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney]
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

[Verse 5: Paul McCartney]
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange

[Chorus 1: Paul McCartney with John Lennon & George Harrison]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

[Chorus 2: Paul McCartney with John Lennon & George Harrison]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane

[Verse 1]
One day, you'll look to see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun

[Verse 2]
Some day, you'll know I was the one
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun

[Bridge]
And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end, you will know
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3]
One day, you'll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun

[Solo]
Yeah, tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun

[Bridge]
And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end, you will know
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3]
One day, you'll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun

[Hook: Akon]
It’s a dirty job but somebody’s gotta do it
I see you working go and put your back into it
Baby I’mma watch… you, just keep it moving
You know exactly what you’re doing
So go and do your dirty work
Go and do your dirty work

[Verse 1: Akon]
Ass up
Face down
Perfect body and she lay it to the ground
Stacked up
Waist down
Wanted to throw it like a pitcher on a mound
I see them niggas reaching for their last dollar
Asking dumb questions like “baby, do you model?”
Promising everything, hopin’ that they follow
Praying for America, I hope they down with Harry Potter
Isn’t she the most beautiful thing that you ever saw?
Don’t she deserve the biggest diamond ring that you ever bought?

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Gettin’ down dirty, gettin’ down dirty, gettin’ down...
Go and do your dirty work
Gettin’ down dirty, gettin’ down dirty, gettin’ down...

[Verse 2: Akon]
Back up
Shake down
Just give it all to me and do it right now
Shack up
Take down
Just wanna love you without looking' like a clown
You’re the best that ever did it
You’re killing everybody, how're you supposed to make a living?
Yes I know you hear it all when they trickin'
I can hear them niggas saying you too pretty to be strippin'
Isn’t she the most beautiful thing that you ever saw?
Don’t she deserve the biggest diamond ring that you ever bought?

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
More money, more problems, less rest
If it’s about a dollar later, shorty, let’s invest
Drop the top, pull the whip out like a hamstring
You on your job but I’m a boss, I keep my hands clean
Keep grabbin' all up on my coat
I’m lettin' out all of this smoke
I’m thrown' money in the air
I’m buying' bottles for my folks
And then I’m coming back for more
‘Cause you know all my favorite features
I'mma roll some of this reefer
You can call me Young Khalifa

[Hook]

Weed loud, I can't hear you
Got a billion on my mirror, say could be closer than it appear to
Blowing big stacks, all we do is that
Valet my shit at 5th, fuck up a check at Saks

Broad looking for me broad day, whenever I'm seen

[Intro]
Yeah. How I sound out there Ali? Good? Then good

[Verse 1]
Can I pay my past a visit?
Centennial Compton School District
And video campus shut the fuck up your premises
King Drew and Westchester had the baddest bitches
And my nigga L Wood had a white Toyota, and we got pulled over
Had to hide the bottle because there was mix with Hennessy and soda
Every time we rode up we was unsober
And everybody had know that
My nigga Yan Yan had all the red P Hat
Which was really dumb because where we was at
Was the other side and more than likely
The other side really didn't like that
Didn't have no burner so if they shot us we could never really shoot back
Could of lost our life over hood rats
We was dumb as fuck but lucky for us we was lucky enough
That the black car didn't pull up and ask where yall niggas from
I know some, nigga less fortunate was fucking with the enemies' bitch
She had a fat ass and a brown Camaro but it wasn't that fast it was like a V6
But anyways she was one of those hoes in highschool with the cornrows
Size 5 Jordans, Rolex sporting, and wanna fight everybody she knows
Well she's important, well she wasn't, she was just so and so so and so cousin
He was a red, so anytime she got into it, that who she would get
Now let me get back to the plan
Homie had ask, " Do ya got a man?"
She said,"No", he said, "Oh yeah
Where do you stay?" She said, " Rosecrans"
Rosecrans and what? She said, "Don't matter just know I fuck
He said, "What? you're a, you're a little freaky bitch huh?"
She said, "Yeah daddy I can you get you sprung
I can work that pussy and the tongue
If you come over I can make you cum
If you come over make sure that you bring drink
Because I like to get to drunk."
And that he did, that Friday he was where she lived
Notice that he was out of bounds
But didn't give a fuck cause he wanted to fuck that bitch right now
Walked in the house, rubber on, panties down
Oldies playing in the background
Let's get it on Marvin Gaye had bumped to the morning
Time to go, picked his pants up off the floor
Kissed that bitch in the mouth then walked to the door
When he walked out he seen a four four Bluh!
Didn't know that was the pussy he was dealing with

[Hook]
And that's how you get your ass killed bitch!
That's how you get your ass killed bitch!
That's how you get your ass killed bitch!
Get your ass killed bitch! How?
Fucking with them hoes, them hoes, them hoes, them hoes
Them hoes hoes, them scandalous hoes
Them hoes hoes will have you uh dead dead dead

[Verse 2]
Look. I guess we all can learn from mistakes
But your first mistake, might be your death date
And death doesn't wait, on no one
A million ways to die, and you can make it a million and one
If you not aware of the rules or maybe tryna fill someone else shoes
Like a square trying to be a gangster kind of remind of this one dude
He wasn't thirteen he was twenty two
When he went to first get put on the hood
He wasn't born it, Boys in the Hood the movie made him think it was all good
But usually this type of person want to prove his s s s s self on purpose
Tell everybody quit working, but really he's worthless
His momma had money, his daddy had money, so he had money
The OG's that gave him a pistol, think that he was gonna be just another crash dummy
And the funny thing about it he thought he was bout it like P-Miller
But he wasn't no killa
Just a monkey hanging around a bunch of gorillas
Everybody wanna be tough guy so he did, approached this guy like, "Where are you from?" with his gun but didn't shoot it, rule number one
Never pull out if you don't use it
Even though the dude didn't banged the very next day he seen around the way blew his brains out while homeboy was cruising
Not knowing the scariest nigga will split your shit

[Hook]
And that's how he got his ass killed bitch!
That's how he got his ass killed bitch!
That's how he got his ass killed bitch!
Fuck around and get your ass killed bitch! How?
Not knowing the G codes, the codes the codes
The G codes, the codes the codes
The G codes, if you don't know then your already dead dead dead
Feel me?

[Verse 1]
Whiskey bottles and brand new cars
Oak tree you're in my way
There's too much coke and too much smoke
Look what's going on inside you

[Chorus]
Ooh, that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Angel of darkness is upon you
Stuck a needle in your arm (You fool, you)
So take another toke, have a blow for your nose
One more drink, fool, would drown you (Hell yeah)

[Chorus]
Ooh, that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

[Verse 3]
Now they call you Prince Charming
Can't speak a word when you're full of 'ludes
Say you'll be alright come tomorrow
But tomorrow might not be here for you (Yeah, you)

[Chorus]
Ooh, that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, you a fool, you
Go on, stick them needles in your arm
Ooh hoo hoo hoo
I know I been there before
(You fool)
(Fool)

[Verse 4]
One little problem that confronts you
Got a monkey on your back
Just one more fix, Lord, might do the trick
One hell of a price for you to get your kicks (Hell yeah)

[Chorus]
Ooh, that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you
Ooh, that smell (Whoa)
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, you a fool, you
Go on, stick those needles in your arm
You're just a fool, just a fool, just a fool
Gimme one more blow
One more blow for my nose, whoa, yeah

[Verse]
Pop champagne, roll some weed up
We in a slow game, I brung the speed up
High-octane, hella' inked up
Bird or plane, you prolly seen us
Made a little change, but it's all good
Never throw it in your face, I'm from a small hood
Best dressed like a star should
Beat on so I could hardly see y'all
We are, some Taylor Gang fucking bosses
And I live every day, not caring what the cost is
Pop more bands, cop more clothes
Drive fast cars, fuck bad hoes
I fly in circles, you non-workers in dirt last
Reading tweets and falling asleep in first class
Might have heard my song, but lot of y'all ain't know the kid
So I took over the net like Hova did
And set my goals where the solar is
Now my swag on Polar Bear
And you here, so pretend your man don't even exist
And get your lips wet like a lisp
I'm dressed like a pimp, some dislike from them
But I'm a big fish, you just tiger shrimp
Flirted with fame, but at night I dream of success
If you sleepin' on me, then you gettin' good rest
Yes, cause when niggas' ask; Who hot?
If it ain't Drizzy, then they talkin' 'bout me

[Verse 1]
Wake from your sleep
The drying of your tears
Today we escape, we escape

[Verse 2]
Pack and get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell breaks loose

[Verse 3]
Breathe, keep breathing
Don't lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I can't do this alone

[Verse 4]
Sing us a song
A song to keep us warm
There's such a chill
Such a chill

[Verse 5]
And you can laugh a spineless laugh
We hope your rules and wisdom choke you
Now we are one in everlasting peace
We hope that you choke, that you choke

[Outro]
We hope that you choke
That you choke
We hope that you choke
That you choke

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Baby, you don't have to treat me all anti
Why you wanna put me on standby?
I can't lie, girl you're hotter than a campfire
We can stay up all night like vampires
Complement each other like burgers and french fries
In the last minute I done thought about you ten times
Fine on the out but she pretty on the inside
And every since she left it's like my heart died

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Baby I think you can bring out Gucci's other side
She said, "How you don't you trust me, you did a homicide?"
Then said, "I got a boyfriend who I can't put aside
Even though the grass so much greener on the other side."
And every man like what he can't have
It's funny but I came back
Baby girl so bad, diss me but I ain't mad
Why you wanna tease me?
You should wanna squeeze me
Homie ain't the kid, baby he could never be me
How you wanna go and act anti-social
Bet your man don't know you like I know you, so true
Maybe one day babe you gon get your mind right
And if you looking for me you can find me in Atlanta

[HOOK]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
(Well damn!)
Once upon a time a long time ago
I had a bitch but she felt she had to let me go
Called me and then she came by and said, "Shit
Yeah you got talent but I'm a bad bitch."
But now when I see her shorty whole swag switched
I walk right by her like she don't exist
Her car broke down and it can't get fixed
Her swag broke down and her bag counterfeit
(Well damn!)
That's not Gucci, baby that's floochy
Remember 2000 you was acting all booshie
9 years later and you're best friend choosing
I scooped her in my phantom and I took her to the movies
Gucci don't gotta act anti
Told her she can have me when she want,that's when she fantasized
Told her I can't talk to her cause I got that man pride
Ever since I left baby girl told me her heart died (Gucci!)

[HOOK]

[Verse 3: Mylah]
Excuse me if I sound a little crazy
But just wanna be good to my baby
Cause he been holding me down
And putting it down
He give me everything I don't need no one around
But you're saying you can give it to me better
Get me hot like it's July and I'm rocking a sweater
Just for hitting the road
Would you women let go
Say you got 20/20
Her man's 2004
Maybe I'll give you a try
And keep it low
I could let you ride
Something like a test drive
See baby I ain't so anti

[HOOK]

They say the best things in life are free
That's why it cost for you to get murked
And my pants sagging like fuck it - I'm still on my business

She say she love me, that's the molly talking
She about to blow me, like a signing bonus
She got a nigga but he ain't me bitch
I'm the original gangster, he the remix
Girl, do you use that same mouth to kiss yo momma?
I say, only God can judge me, fuck your honor
And her birthday suit is her pajamas
She say, I didn't know your dick was a recliner
I'll punch your man in his eye, give him a shiner
I'll blind him, him and whoever cosign him
I get Adam like Yolonda
Young Money Cash Money, Obama
It's fuck the world, no condom
If he twisted, I'll unwind him
And this pistol came with a silence

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
But I swear to God he heard it, yeah
And I swear to God I ain't nervous, nah
I swear to God I ain't nervous, uh-uh
Bitch I'm the God, I should be rapping in a turban

I see you turning up but your turn up ain't working
Baby, I just want some mouth and lip service
She gone ride this dick like the Kentucky Derby

[Verse 3: Boo]
On that Pat-ron, I'm swerving, game tight like virgins

You see the niggas I'm with, that boy Boo the shit
As long as I got a face, yo bitch got a place to sit
Yea, I'm wilding off them shroomies
Ain't got no worries like Tunechi

Real niggas winning, fake niggas losing
Bitch I'll leave that pussy with bruises

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Girl, I swear to God I ain't nervous, uh-uh
I swear to God I ain't nervous
No, you know I swear to God I ain't nervous

Ain't got no problems in this bitch and that's for certain
You fuck with Tunechi, you'll end up a missing person
She got Lil Tunechi on her booty, in cursive
I'm getting head behind the Maybach curtains

[Verse 1]
No sun will shine in my day today
(No sun will shine)
The high yellow moon won't come out to play
(That high yellow moon won't come out to play)
I said darkness has covered my light (Darkness has covered my light)
And has changed my day into night, yeah (And has changed my day into night)
Where is the love to be found ?
Won't someone tell me ?
Cause life (Sweet life)
Must be somewhere to be found (Has got to be, out there somewhere for me)
Instead of concrete jungle (Jungle, jungle, jungle)
Where the living is hardest (Concrete jungle)
Concrete jungle (Concrete jungle, jungle, jungle)
Man, you've got to do your best (Concrete jungle)

[Verse 2]
No chains around my feet but I'm not free
I know I am bound here in captivity
Yeah, now (Never know what happiness is)
I've never known happiness
I've never known what sweet caress is (Never know what sweet caress is)
Still, I'll be always laughing like a clown
Won't someone help me ?
Cause I (Sweet life, has got to be)
I've got to pick myself from off the ground
(Out there somewhere for me)
In this here concrete jungle (Jungle, jungle, jungle)
I said, what do you got for me now (Concrete jungle)
Oh ! Concrete jungle (Concrete jungle, jungle, jungle)
Why won't you let me be, now ? (Concrete jungle)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I said that life (Sweet life)
It must be somewhere to be found (Has got to be out there somewhere for me)
Oh, instead of concrete jungle (Jungle, jungle, jungle)
Illusion (concrete, jungle !)
Confusion (Concrete, jungle !)

[Outro]
Eh ! Concrete jungle
You name it, you've got it in
Concrete jungle, now (Concrete jungle)
Eh ! Concrete jungle (Jungle, jungle, jungle)
What do you got for me, now ?

[Intro]
Somebody just look back over your life and
See where He brought you from
How many of you know?

Prayer changes (I heard that)
Prayer changes (I believe that)
Prayer changes (I know that)
Prayer changes things
Prayer changes (I heard that)
Prayer changes (I believe that)
Prayer changes (I know that)
Prayer changes things

[Verse 1]
Now I was in a real bad abusive relationship
Knowing that, that was no way for me to live
A young girl like me, raised up in a good family
Way too young to endure such misery
And every night I cry myself to sleep from all the pain
And the more I prayed for sunny days it seemed to rain
(He hit me) at any given time
(He hit me) no reason at all
(He hit me) so so hard
(He hit me) my God, sometimes I'd fall
Mama asked what happened to me
And I'd take up for him
She said that devil's a liar
And pray get rid of him
And now I'm going to school
Hitting those books
I'm doing fine
He's out my life
I'm not confused
Got peace of mind
Man I tell you

[Hook]
Prayer changes (it changes)
Prayer changes (oh it changes)
Prayer changes (I'm a witness that)
Prayer changes things (said I know)

[Verse 2]
I was a freshman in college and uh
I had just made it on the basketball team
I had all the skills it took to make it
But on my grades I would get nothing but all D's
And the coach came to me
And had a talk with me about my career
Said if you don't get your grades up
I'm gonna have to sit you down this year
Man as tough as I was I broke down and cried
'Cause everybody knows me
Knows that basketball is my life
(Algebra) I studied hard
(Chemistry) I gave my all
(Calculus) oh my God
(English) so many flaws
Playing ball didn't look to good for me
My future, could not see
I had lost all my beliefs
And gave up on all my dreams
Then I went to church on Sunday
And the pastor began to preach
It was like he was talking to me
When he said I can do all things
In Christ that strengthens me
And for me that was enough
Now that I went from a D
All the way to an A plus
I tell you prayer changes things

[Hook]...

[Verse 3]
Me and my wife had a few problems
We thought that nothing could solve them
Listening to family members and so called friends
Man I tell you that's just how the devil creeps in
We were separated at least for a month or two
She was wilding in the clubs
And I was out there doing wrong too
And we would walk around the house
Putting each other down
I mean right in front of the kids
We would curse each other out
Then I was in a bad accident
And almost lost my life
And guess who was there for me
My wife
Now ain't it funny how He makes a way
When we said there was no way
I'm out the hospital and back at home
Planning another wedding day, I tell you

Prayer changes (it changes)
Prayer changes (prayer changes)
Prayer changes (prayer changes)
Prayer changes things (things, I'm a witness that)
Prayer changes (change)
Prayer changes (prayer changes)
Prayer changes (prayer changes)
Prayer changes things

[Verse 4]
Now all of these things were happening in one family
But that's okay, cause there's nothing God can't achieve
I don't care what the problem in your life may be
Cause who the Son sets free, is free indeed
And if you didn't know, now you should know
All you have to do is take this family life for example
Now Mom and Dad are married again
Four kids now, cause they just had twins
Little sister all grown up now
She's a lawyer, married with one child now
Two years, big brother's out of college
And man he's got his hands full
Blessed with skills, blessed with knowledge
Now he's playing for the Chicago Bulls

[Outro]
Prayer changes (I'm a witness yeah)
Prayer changes (prayer changes)
Prayer changes (prayer changes)
Prayer changes things (woah when it looks like)
Prayer changes (you can't go on)
Prayer changes (I know that prayer)
Prayer changes (changes things)

Prayer changes (prayer will calm)
Prayer changes (cause it changes things)

Prayer changes (and all your strength is gone)
Prayer changes (hold on it won't be long)
Prayer changes things (I know prayer is gonna change)

[Intro]
Oh, listen to that now
Heh, heh, heh
Oh look out! It's-"

[Verse 1]
She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

[Chorus]
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

[Verse 2]
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob

[Chorus]
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

[Outro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Chorus]
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Verse 2]
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry

[Outro]
And I will sing a lullaby

[Verse 1]
Jesus, don't cry
You can rely on me honey
You can combine anything you want
I'll be around
You were right about the stars
Each one is a setting sun

[Chorus]
Tall buildings shake
Voices escape singing sad sad songs
Tuned to chords strung down your cheeks
Bitter melodies turning your orbit around

[Verse 2]
Don't cry
You can rely on me honey
You can come by any time you want
I'll be around
You were right about the stars
Each one is a setting sun

[Chorus]
Tall buildings shake
Voices escape singing sad sad songs
Tuned to chords strung down your cheeks
Bitter melodies turning your orbit around

[Bridge]
Voices whine
Skyscrapers are scraping together
Your voice is smoking
Last cigarettes are all you can get
Turning your orbit around

[Verse 3]
Our love
Our love
Our love is all we have
Our love
Our love is all of God's money
Everyone is a burning sun

[Chorus]
Tall buildings shake
Voices escape singing sad sad songs
Tuned to chords strung down your cheeks
Bitter melodies turning your orbit around

[Bridge]
Voices whine
Skyscrapers are scraping together
Your voice is smoking
Last cigarettes are all you can get
Turning your orbit around

[Outro]
Last cigarettes are all you can get
Turning your orbit around
Last cigarettes are all you can get
Turning your orbit around

[Intro: Queen]
I want it all (Hey, yeah), I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now

[Verse 1: Freddie Mercury]
Adventure seeker on an empty street
Just an alley creeper light on his feet
A young fighter screaming
With no time for doubt
With the pain and anger
Can't see a way out

[Pre-Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
"It ain't much I'm asking"
I heard him say
"Got to find me a future
Move out of my way"

[Chorus: Queen]
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now

[Verse 2: Freddie Mercury]
Listen, all you people, come gather 'round
I gotta get me a game plan
Gotta shake you to the ground
Just give me what I know is mine
People, do you hear me?
Just give me the sign

[Pre-Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
It ain't much I'm asking
If you want the truth
Here's to the future
For the dreams of youth

[Chorus: Queen]
I want it all, I want it all
(Give it all, I want it all)
I want it all, and I want it now (Hey)
I want it all, I want it all
(Yes, I want it all, hey)
I want it all, and I want it now

[Bridge: Brian May (and Freddie Mercury)]
I'm a man with a one-track mind
So much to do in one lifetime
(People, do you hear me?)
Not a man for compromise
And where's and why's and living lies
So I'm living it all (Yes, I'm living it all)
And I'm giving it all
(And I'm giving it all, ooh, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(I want it all)

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
It ain't much I'm asking
If you want the truth
Here's to the future
Hear the cry of youth
(Hear the cry, hear the cry of youth)

[Chorus: Queen]
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all
(Hey, yeah, yeah)
I want it all, and I want it now
(Ooh, ooh) I want it now

[Outro: Freddie Mercury]
I want it, I want it!
Oooh, huh!

[Verse 1]
I came upon a child of God
He was walking along the road
And I asked him, "Where are you going?"
And this he told me

I'm going on down to Yasgur's Farm
I'm gonna join in a rock and roll band
I'm gonna camp out on the land
I'm gonna try and get my soul free

[Chorus]
We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

[Verse 2]
Then can I walk beside you?
I have come here to lose the smog
And I feel to be a cog in something turning
Well maybe it is just the time of year
Or maybe it's the time of man
I don't know who I am
But you know life is for learning

[Chorus]
We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

[Bridge]
By the time we got to Woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere there was song and celebration

And I dreamed I saw the bombers
Riding shotgun in the sky
And they were turning into butterflies
Above our nation

[Chorus]
We are stardust
Billion year old carbon
We are golden
Caught in the devil's bargain
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden
(To some semblance of a garden.)

[Hook]
Baby, I know that you lying, probably gon' deny it
I know that you scheming when you say you going home
You think you can hide it, he calls you up on private
If you're not with him now then baby kiss me through the phone
Swear you're all alone
Than kiss me thru the phone
Or I'm gon leave you all alone

[Verse One]:

Babe, baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you

Leave you when the summer comes along

[Bridge 2]
Oh, I miss you, baby

You made me happy every single day
But now I've got to go away
Oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
Baby, baby, baby
That's when it's calling me
I said that's when it's calling me back home

[Chorus]
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

[Instrumental Break 0:23-0:44]

[Verse]
I never give you my pillow
I only send you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down

[Chorus]
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

[Transition]

[Verse 1]
You know you shook me
You shook me all night long

You shook me so hard
Baby, baby, baby, please come home

I have a bird that whistles
And I have birds that sing

Oh, oh, buy a diamond ring

[Instrumental break 2:03-4:54]

[Call-and-response between Plant and Page's guitar]
You shook me all night long

[Verse]
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she doesn't have a lot to say
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she changes from day to day
I want to tell her that I love her a lot
But I gotta get a bellyful of wine
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
Someday I'm going to make her mine, oh yeah
Someday I'm going to make her mine

[Instrumental intro 0:00-1:17]

[Verse 1]
Lying, cheating, hurting, that's all you seem to do
Messing around every guy in town
Putting me down for thinking of someone new
Always the same, playing your game
Drive me insane, trouble is gonna come to you
One of these days and it won't be long
You'll look for me but, baby, I'll be gone
This is all I gotta say to you, woman

[Chorus]
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come

[Verse 2]
Made up my mind, break you this time
Won't be so fine, it's my turn to cry
Do what you want, I won't take the brunt
It's fading away, can't feel you anymore
Don't care what you say 'cause I'm going away to stay
Going to make you pay for that great big hole in my heart
People talking all around
Watch out, woman, no longer
Is the joke gonna be on my heart
You been bad to me, woman
But it's coming back home to you

[Chorus]
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come (bye-bye, baby)
Your time is gonna come (bye-bye, bye-bye)
Your time is gonna come (

Your time is gonna come (oh, oh, oh-oh)
Your time is gonna come (

Your time is gonna come (

Your time is gonna come (

[Verse 1]
Oh, I can't quit you, babe
So I'm gonna put you down for awhile
I said I can't quit you, babe
I guess I got to put you down for awhile
Said you messed up my happy home
Made me mistreat my only child
Yes, you did, babe, oh

[Verse 2]
Said you know I love you, baby
My love for you I could never hide
Oh, you know I love you, babe
My love for you I could never hide
Oh, when I feel you near me, little girl
I know you are my one desire, yeah
Oh, ooohh, yeah

[Instrumental break 1:44- 3:41]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
When you hear me moaning and groaning, baby
You know it hurts me deep down inside
Oh, when you hear me moaning and groaning, babe
You know it hurts me deep down inside
Oh, when you hear me holler, baby
You know you're my one desire
Yes, you are, ohh

[Intro]
Aaahhhhh

[Verse 1]
How many more times treat me the way you wanna do?
How many more times treat me the way you wanna do?
When I give you all my love
Please, please be true

[Verse 2]
I'll give you all I've got to give, rings, pearls, and all
I'll give you all I've got to give, rings, pearls, and all
I've got to get you together, baby
I'm sure, sure you're gonna call
Oh, when's the last time I done asked you?

[Instrumental break]
2:11 - 4:08

[Interlude]
I was a young man, I couldn't resist
Started thinking it over, just what I had missed
Got me a girl, and I kissed her and then and then
Whoops, oh no, yeah, well, I did it again
Now I' got ten children of my own
I got another child on the way, that makes eleven
But I'm in constant heaven
I know it's all right in my mind
'Cause I got a little schoolgirl, and she's all mine
I can't get through to her 'cause it doesn't permit
But I'm gonna give her everything I've got to give

[Bridge]
Oh, Rosie, oh, girl
Oh, Rosie, oh, girl
Steal away now, steal away
Steal away, baby, steal away
Little Robert Anthony wants to come and play
Why don't you come to me, baby
Steal away, all right, all right

[Verse 3]
Well, they call me the hunter
That's my name
They call me the hunter
That's how I got my fame
Ain't no need to hide
Ain't no need to run
'Cause I've got you in the sights of my gun

[Verse 4]
How many more times, barrel house all night long, all right
How many more times, barrel house all night long?
Well, I've got to get to you, baby
So, please come home

[Outro]
Why don't you listen to me, baby?
Why don't you please come home?
Why don't you please come home?
Why don't you please come home?

[Verse 1]
I had a hard run
Running from your window
I was all night running, running, running
I wonder if you care?
I had a run-in
Run around and run down
Run around a corner
Run smack into a tree

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 2]
Dressed myself in green
I went down to the sea
Try to see what's going down
Try to read between the lines
Had a feeling I was falling, falling, falling
Turned around to see
Heard a voice a-calling, calling, calling
You was coming after me
Back to me

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 3]
Ran into a rainstorm
Ducked into a bar door
It was all night pouring, pouring rain
But not a drop on me
Test me, test me
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me in the jail house
Until the sun goes down
Till it go down

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse]
All I know is something like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a little while
And then flew on

Tell me all that you know
I'll show you
Snow and rain

If you hear that same sweet song again
Will you know why?
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet
Is passing by

Laugh in the sunshine
Sing
Cry in the dark
Fly
Through the night
Don't cry now
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Anymore
La-la-la-la
Sleep
In the stars
Don't you cry
Dry your eyes on the wind
La-la-la-la
La...

[Verse 1]
Wake up, blood-shot eye
Struggle to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
It feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that, after that
Try to get you back

[Pre-Chorus]
I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you

[Chorus]
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah, so this is goodbye

[Verse 2]
God damn my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I've left unsaid
I want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
I get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you

[Chorus 2]
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try, yeah
And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
Oh no, so this is goodbye

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I've been here before
One day I'll wake up and it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you say don't have a meaning

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you and I
And so this is goodbye

[Chorus 2]
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try, yeah
And you don't how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
Oh no, so this is goodbye

[Outro]
(Oh no) So this is goodbye
(Oh no) Yeah, so this is goodbye
(Oh no) Yeah, so this is goodbye

[Verse 1]
Oh yeah, alright
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

[Drum & Guitar Solos]

[Instrumental Break 0:20-1:32]
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love

[Verse 2]
And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make

[Instrumental Outro 1:49-2:22]

[Verse 1]
Joan was quizzical, studied pataphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube, oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
"Can I take you out to the pictures, Joa-oa-oa-oan?"
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

[Verse 2]
Back in school again, Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times "I must not be so, o, o, o"
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head (Do-do-do-do-do)
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead (Do-do-do-do-do)

[Verse 3]
P. C. 31 said, "We caught a dirty one"
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh
Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-o
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head (Do-do-do-do-do)
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead

[Outro]
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oa
(Do-do-do-do-do)
(Silver hammer man)

[Chorus]
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

[Verse 1]
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus's garden in the shade

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus's garden with me

[Chorus]
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

[Verse 2]
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hide-a-way beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus's garden near a cave

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found

[Chorus]
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves (Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh, what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe (Happy and they're safe)

[Pre-Chorus 3]
We would be so happy, you and me
No one there to tell us what to do

[Chorus]
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden with you

[Outro]
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you

[Intro]
Ahh

[Verse 1]
Because the world is round, it turns me on
Because the world is round
Ahh

[Verse 2]
Because the wind is high, it blows my mind
Because the wind is high
Ahh

[Bridge]
Love is old, love is new
Love is all, love is you

[Verse 3]
Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue

[Outro]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ahh-ah, ahh-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ahh

[Verse 1]
Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

[Verse 2]
His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

[Verse 1]
Well, you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking, but she looks like a man
Well, you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes, you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl that makes "The News of the World"
Yes, you could say she was attractively built
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Hey!) Great!

[Verse 1]
Had to get the train
From Potsdamer platz
You never knew that
That I could do that
Just walking the dead
Sitting in the Dschungel
On Nürnberger Strasse
A man lost in time near KaDeWe
Just walking the dead

[Chorus]
Where are we now?
Where are we now?
The moment you know
You know, you know

[Verse 2]
Twenty thousand people
Cross Bösebrücke
Fingers are crossed
Just in case
Walking the dead

[Chorus]
Where are we now?
Where are we now?
The moment you know
You know, you know

[Outro]
As long as there's sun
As long as there's sun
As long as there's rain
As long as there's rain
As long as there's fire
As long as there's fire
As long as there's me
As long as there's you

[Intro]
Wholy holy
Come together
Wholy holy
People, we all got to come together
Because we need the strength, power and all the feeling

[Verse 1]
Wholy holy
Oh Lord, get together, one another
Wholy holy
We should believe in one another
Jesus left a long time ago, said he would return
He left us a book to believe in, in it we've got a lot to learn
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Wholy
Oh Lord, we can conquer hate forever, we need him
Wholy
We can rock the world's foundation
Everybody together, together and holy
Will holler love, love, love across the nation

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Wholy holy
All together and holy
We proclaim love, our salvation
Oh, oh, ooo

[Verse 1]
And if I say to you tomorrow
Take my hand, child, come with me
It's to a castle I will take you
Where what's to be, they say will be

[Chorus]
Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky, ...

[?]
But the wind won't blow, you really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine, by taking our time
Oh..

[Verse 2]
And if you say to me tomorrow
Oh, what fun it all would be
Then what's to stop us, pretty baby
But what is and what should never be?

[Chorus]
Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky, ...

[?]
But the wind won't blow, you really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine, by taking our time

[Instrumental break 1:36-2:38]

[Verse 3]
So if you wake up with the sunrise
And all your dreams are still as new
And happiness is what you need so bad
Girl, the answer lies with you, yeah

[Chorus]
Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky, ...

[?]
But the wind won't blow, you really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine, by taking our time

[Outro]
Hey, ho, but the wind won't blow, and we really shouldn't go
And it only goes to show
Catch the wind, we're going to see it spin, we're going to...sail, leave today
Do do do, bop bop a do-oh. My my my my my my yeah
Everybody I know seems to know me well
But they're never going to know that I move like hell
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby. Oh lord
Baby baby babe. Huh? Oh, I love ya
Do no no no no no no. C'mon now
I want you now

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I should have quit you long time ago
Ohh, yeahhh, long time ago
I wouldn't be here, my children
Down on this killing floor

[Verse 2]
I should have listened, baby, to my second mind
Oh, I should have listened, baby, to my second mind
Every time I go away and leave you, darling
You send me the blues way down the line
Oh..

[Instrumental break 1:25-2:41]

[Guitar Solo Hook]

[Verse 3]
Babe, yeah
Give it to me, baby
Ooh, my, my, my, my, my
I'll take it down a little bit
People tell me, baby
Can't be satisfied
Tryin' to worry me, baby, but I'd never get you with myself
Keep on worrying, baby
Can't keep you satisfied
Huh, let me tell you, baby
You ain't nothing but a two-bit, no-good jive...

[Verse 4]
I went to sleep last night, I worked as hard as I can
I bring home my money
You take my money
Give it to another man
I should have quit you, baby
Oh, such a long time ago, oh
I wouldn't be here with all my troubles
Down on this killing floor

[Verse 5]
Squeeze me, baby, till the juice runs down my leg
Squeeze me, baby, till the juice runs down my leg
The way you squeeze my lemon, ah
I'm gonna fall right out of bed
Bed, bed, bed, yeah

[Bridge]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, oh

[Guitar Solo Hook]

[Outro]
I'm going to leave my children down on this killing floor

[Chorus]
If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me

[Bridge]
Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman, nothing more

[Verse 1]
Little drops of rain whisper of the pain
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by
My love is strong
With you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die, my, my, my
An inspiration is what you are to me
Inspiration - look, see

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
And so today, my world, it smiles
Your hand in mine, we walk the miles
And thanks to you it will be done
For you to me are the only one
All right, yeah
Happiness, no more be sad
Happiness - I'm glad

[Chorus]
If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me

[Verse 1]
Hey fellas, have you heard the news?
You know that Annie's back in town
It won't take long, just watch and see
How the fellas lay their money down

[Verse 2]
Her style is new, but the face the same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes, a different smile
Like that of one who knows

[Verse 3]
Well, it's been ten years or maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue

[Verse 4]
Some people cry, and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rolling along
With the grace of the Lord above

[Verse 5]
People talking all around
About the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say
I know where their jive is at

[Verse 6]
One thing I do have on my mind
If you can clarify, please do
It's the way you call me another guy's name
When I try to make love to you, yeah

I try to make love, but it ain't no use
Give it to me, give it

[Instrumental break 2:02-3:40]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 7]
Mm, work so hard I couldn't unwind
Get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand times
However hard I tried

[Outro]
Heartbreaker; your time has come
Can't take your evil way
Go away, heartbreaker
Heartbreaker!
Heartbreaker!
Heart!

[Verse 1]
With a purple umbrella and a fifty-cent hat
Living, loving, she's just a woman
Missus Cool rides out in her aged Cadillac
Living, loving, she's just a woman

[Chorus]
Come on, babe, on the roundabout
Ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is
So you better lay your money down

[Verse 2]
Alimony, alimony, paying your bills
Living, loving, she's just a woman
When your conscience hits, you knock it back with pills
Living, loving, she's just a woman

[Chorus]
Come on, babe, on the roundabout
Ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is
So you better lay your money down

[Verse 3]
Telling tall tales of how it used to be
Living, loving, she's just a woman
With the butler and the maid and the servants three
Living, loving, she's just a woman

Ah, get it now, get it

[Solo]
Ooo, you got it

[Verse 4]
Nobody hears a single word you say
Living, loving, she's just a woman
But you keep on talking till your dying day
Living, loving, she's just a woman

[Chorus]
Come on, babe, on the roundabout
Ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is
So you better lay your money down

[Outro]
Living, loving, she's just a woman
Living, living, loving, loving, she's just a woman
Li-li-li-li-live, lo-lo-lo-lo-love, she's just a woman

[Hook]
Oh, not even a year
Has gone by already
You've got him
I want to see
Where I am

[Verse 1]
When I live
In newer places
I'll make sure
I'm further from you
When problems come
Two by two
I know it's
Not the truth

[Bridge]
Is this how it ends?
With someone to be with
Obsessed with ideas
That leave no one impressed

[Verse 2]
Often nights end in
The morning for me
Out on the floor
Where I seem more welcome

[Bridge]
Is this how it ends?
With someone to be with
Obsessed with ideas
That leave no one impressed

[Hook]
Oh, not even a year
Has gone by already
You've got him
I want to see
Where I am

[Intro]
Come home in the summer
Live a life that you miss (that you miss)
It's alright
I'll fill you in (fill you in)
Don't you wait
For me to call your name again

[Hook]
I see the wind blow into my shins
Each grain cuts into my nerves
It's hard to let you come on in
And let you know that I was hurt

[Bridge]
Search for a life
Every second
Every day, every night
It's a blessing

[Verse]
I found a job
I do it fine
Do it fine
Not what I want
But still I try

[Hook]
I see the wind blow into my shins
Each grain cuts into my nerves
It's hard to let you come on in
And let you know that I was hurt

[Intrumental]

[Intro]
Yeah, it's real simple bitch
You understand me?
Bitch I'm a player now
Your main bitch works for me
Yeah. Yeah

[Verse]
I haven't worn a shirt since 1993
That's the year I moved my operation to the beach
Half a dozen cameras on me when I'm in the streets
Pop, pop!
Hit out on me
Building mansions on the sand
Your girl looks like Kelis
She must hate you so much right now
She must hate you so much right now
Run my fingers through her hair
My girl looks like Kelis
Man she must love me so...

[Skit: Paul Rosenberg]
Hey Em, it's Paul, uh, listen, I just got a call from the label
And you're probably not gonna be surprised but, um
Michael Jackson is extremely upset about the Just Lose It video
And, um, I mean he's pissed, so I-I don't know what he's gonna do
But we gotta talk about how we're gonna handle this
Um, oh yeah, anyway, somebody told me that, um
They heard a rumor that you got a new gun
Um, I know it's probably not true
But I just need to talk to you about that
So, um, gimme a call
*Crowd cheering*
*Eminem humming to himself*
*Checking mic*

We still on?
*Machinery starting*
Yo, is the mic on?
Check, check, check, aight, it's good, let's go, come on

*Machinery working*
*Cheering intensifies*
(Eminem, Eminem, Eminem!
Eminem, Eminem, Eminem!
Eminem, Eminem, Eminem!
Eminem, Eminem, Eminem!)

[Verse 1]
I’m out here a thousand miles from my home
Walking a road other men have gone down
I’m seeing your world of people and things
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
About a funny old world that’s a-coming along
Seems sick and it’s hungry, it’s tired and it’s torn
It looks like it’s a-dying and it’s hardly been born

[Verse 3]
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
All the things that I’m a-saying an a-many times more
I’m a-singing you the song, but I can’t sing enough
Because there’s not many men that done the things that you’ve done

[Verse 4]
Here’s to Cisco and Sonny and Leadbelly too
And to all the good people that traveled with you
Here’s to the hearts and the hands of the men
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind

[Verse 5]
I’m a-leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today
Somewhere down the road someday
The very last thing that I’d want to do
Is to say I’ve been hitting some hard traveling too

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson & Janet Jackson]
I'm tired of injustice, I'm tired of the schemes
Your lies are disgusting
So what does it mean, damn it
Kickin' me down, I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damn it
Peek in the shadow, come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong
Then you better prove you're right
You're selling out souls, but I, I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, & Both]
With such confusion
Don't it make you want to scream? (Make you want to scream)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Somebody please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it

[Chorus: Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, & Both]
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream (You just, you just)

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson & Janet Jackson]
I'm tired of you tellin' (Tellin')
The story your way (Story your way)
You're causin' confusion (Confusion)
You think it's okay, damn it
You keep changin' the rules
While I, I keep playing the game
I can't take it much longer
I think I might go insane
Ah, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, & Both]
With such confusion, don't it make you want to scream? (Make you want to scream)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You find your pleasure scandalizing every lie
Oh Father, please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Janet Jackson]
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop fuckin' with me, make me want to scream

[Bridge: Janet Jackson & Michael Jackson]
Oh my God, can't believe what I saw as I turned on the TV
This evening, I was disgusted by all the injustice
All the injustice (All the injustice)
Yeah, yeah
Baby (Whoa)

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, & Both]
With such collusions, don't it make you want to scream? (Make you want to scream)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme (Make you want to scream)
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Oh brother, please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Janet Jackson]
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream

[Intro]
This is for my soldiers
Not my soldiers that chose to be soldiers
But the soldiers that were forced to be soldiers

Now what’s the trouble, you scared of being a human?
If the truth is a tool I double dare you to use it
Hit the booth and I’m well aware of what I’m doin’
If I confuse you with the humor I’m preparing them for the movement
I’ve been alive before and every person’s got a purpose
Most don’t observe it or know what they’re striving towards
Only you can light the torch
Cause you won’t survive the war if you don’t know what the fuck it is you’re fighting for
Most of us won’t open up and trust the inner source
Combined with being tempted to just accept it
But don’t twist the message, if you must think of my support
Sometimes you gotta pull off the tees and get on some left right left shit
I worked with 80 soldiers hooded behind locked doors
Forced into a war, an entrance with no exit
Before they could grow up, just some crazy soldiers
Arming them with crack and guns, in essence, defenceless
Yup, my man rapping, charismatic and handsome
In his own words 21st century panther
Thirteen-years-old gets into a fight
Decided to steal the kid’s bike
Cops come and he ends up in hand cuffs
Two months in and now he’s caught in the trap
Got out, got caught with a gat and crack
Now what do these people think
Juvenile life like that he grew up in a room with a mac
And he’ll be policed until the day he can legally drink

[Hook]
Now tell me what’s the matter with this picture
I wish it was a dream but it seems too vivid
There’s blood on these streets I can’t see who’s is it
I should probably mind my business
I said tell me what’s the matter with this picture
I wish it was a dream but it seems to vivid
There’s blood on these streets I can see whose is it
America wants me to mind my business

Now if you contain anything in a cage
Its natural tendency is going to try to be escape right?
When these kids get out of the gates and face life
If you raised them as a criminal what do you estimate they’ll behave like?
The ratio is 80 something percent of kids who get locked up again or go straight to the pen
And that’s strange right
It’s a snowball effect, and they wanna see you again
So they can make sure that America remains white
Yup, going back on that race shit
Most of the neighborhoods are like cages they try and escape and
If the American dream is to make it
It’s obviously blatant that if you’re left with nothing, what do you do?
Take it
Attempted Murder was the case
My man got beat up, stomped in his face
Ask George Bush what you do when you’re attacked
His boy went and let it spray, hit one of them in the leg
Now George you can relate
Remember Iraq, or was it Afghanistan? Just ain't funny
Proving sometimes you gotta take something to make money
My man’s homie snitched and said that he planned to hit
And he’ll be out when he’s 46
Now ain’t the game something
The soldiers follow the same orders
The generals are Crips folk and south of the border
Nortenos and bloods
Now is it a kid with a gun or the system he lives in that has his disorder
If there’s a fiend on the block, somebody’s serving em
If there’s a teen with a Glock, there’s a cop looking to turn 'em in
If you have something I want, there’s somebody murdering
Since 1492, where the fuck do you think we learned it from

[Hook]

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
You niggas ain't nothin', nothin', nothin'
See me undercover, fist pumpin' with your cousin
Pull up to the club, let ya hear the speakers bump
Wit' a honey and a Hummer, got her cummin' on my thumb
I am second to none, drummer steady drummin'
And I don't need keys, I'm just thumpin' on the button
Shawty want my love and she not thinkin' nothin' of it
So I told her, "get in line," she can come and take a number
She lookin' at my pocket like she gettin' something from me
And if she think she is, then this bitch is really dumb and
I'm a boss, get lost, Maybach, Rick Ross
I'm lookin' for a chick wit' the ability to keep that booty jumpin'
Ya see what I got cookin'? Put my meat up in that oven
And when it's all over, you can get ready for supper
They say that I'm a pornstar, call me T-Pumper

[Chorus: Detail & T-Pain]
What ya say? What ya say?
Yeah, got her shakin' that thing like it's
(Huh) (Hell naw!) (Hell naw!)
Said her ass so fat, she ain't even tryna tuck it
Got her suckin' and fuckin' like it's nothin', nothin', nothin'

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Look at this motherfuckin' rug that I'm cuttin'
These bitches act sidity but these chickens steady cluckin'
Like it's nothin', nothin', nothin and they don't give a fuck if
I'm up in the Maserati or I'm duckin' in a bucket and I love it
Big chain, Teddy P, T-Pain, that's me
I do my thang, twenty-eights, turnin' lane
They see me wit' a couple bad bitches and they know I keep it truckin'
Bottle of that drink and I'm feelin' kinda lucky
And if they playin' games, it's the deuces that I'm chuckin'
Cause they know why they came, they ain't fuckin'? Nigga, fuck 'em
In the butt, what's up? Damn right, you gon' let a nigga cut
Fo sho', yee ain't know? Teddy Pain from the 8-5-0, pussy nigga ain't

[Chorus: Detail & (T-Pain)]
What ya say? What ya say?
Yeah, got her shakin' that thing like it's
(Huh) (Hell naw!) (Hell naw!)
Said her ass so fat, she ain't even tryna tuck it
Got her suckin' and fuckin'-

[Verse 3: E-40]
She might be 19, but she ain't green
Her coochie get sticky and goopy like Vaseline (Uh!)
But I'm much growner, so I sick my son, Droop-E, on her
He knocked it out the park, hit a homer all four quarters
Zip of broc' and a six-pack of Corona
Damn fool, he a boss like his pops, ganged-up, hella cool (Bitch!)
When I slide through the function, kisses and huggin'
Hella alcohol and I ain't talkin' 'bout rubbin'
Squares mean muggin', cause we forward and they backwards
They got a 'N' on they chest for "nothin'"
I got a 'S' on my chest for "somethin'" (Uh!)
So, what I told that square ass poodle? (What you tell that money?)
"I'll spaghetti yo' noodle!" (Yo' noodle)
She off Ciroc and that Henny and that Landy
Got on pink panties lookin' like Nuvo, bi-otch!

[Chorus: Detail & (T-Pain)]
What ya say? What ya say?
Yeah, got her shakin' that thing like it's
(Huh) (Hell naw!) (Hell naw!)
Said her ass so fat, she ain't even tryna tuck it
Got her suckin' and fuckin' like it's nothin', nothin', nothin'
What ya say? What ya say?
Yeah, got her shakin' that thing like it's
(Huh) (Hell naw!) (Hell naw!)
Said her ass so fat, she ain't even tryna tuck it
Got her suckin' and fuckin' like it's nothin', nothin', nothin'

[Verse]
I wish I was a chair
So I could feel the pressure of your pillow
And if you wonder why I stare
It’s ‘cause you’re sculpted to perfection
Caramel glow complexion
Just the way I like it
I like it
I love you
Talented hands of a masseuse
Ooh baby, put those to use
And when it’s not my day
You make everything okay

[Chorus]
You’re so fly, you’re so cool
You’re so fly, you’re so cool
Watchin' you, things you do
You like me, I like you
You’re so fly, fly, fly
Intro:
Oh yea
Cut the music up in the phones Ju
My hair is blockin it
My shit growing like my money

Let’s go!

Dip, Dip set
I get on extra grind
I get on extra grind
I get on extra grind
When its when its reppin time
When its reppin time
When its when its reppin time
When its reppin time
When its when its reppin time
I get on extra grind
I get on extra grind
I get on extra grind
When its when its reppin time
When its reppin time
When its when its reppin time
When its reppin time
When its when its reppin time
When its reppin time
When its when its reppin time
When its reppin time
When its when its reppin time
When its reppin time
When its when its reppin time
When its reppin time
When its when its reppin time

Verse 1:
I’m so Dipset dips out baby
If you don’t like it nigga fuck you with an AIDS dick
I hope you die thirty times
Nigga murder moms
No fast talk I’m on that syrup I’m on that turtle time
If Killa say the nigga dead then the nigga dead
If Stunna say the nigga dead then the nigga dead
VIP we be them niggas bangin’ in the red
Don’t drink Cristal no more just pour it on white bitches’ heads
This ain't no Tommy Hilfiger this that Polo ho
We are the biggest group alive that get that solo dough
And we gone get that dough until they say there’s no more dough
I smoke an ounce I got that bounce I got that pogo flow
Just shot a video with R Kelly but no homo though
Really didn’t want to do it but I fuck with TS and Fat Joe Joe though
I am a robot and this robot is on overload
And bitch I always will be hot like I’m in overcoats
Chorus

Verse 2:
Dollar after dollar
Holla at your guala
I’m Rolling like the Stones
I need a water bottle
And if you need a pill
T Streets and Carter got em
Supply the whole party
We got the party poppin'
We in New Orleans poppin
We way in harlem poppin
In California poppin
Them Ed Hardy rockin skinny ho’s with all them problems
Bitch you can eat these pills and chill and tell me all about them
Shittt
Hold up my heart is knocking
Don’t worry water stops it
Hold up your mouth is dry
Don’t worry water mops it
I got a great idea
We should have sex
Bitch I’m like Dante Hall
I just throw up the x
My dick be still hard
I be so up for next
That’s when you slip up and fuck around and fuck your ex
That be that bullshit
But it’s the fuckin best
I get her to pop a pill
And come and fuck the set
And I fuckin rep

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
I thought you said you’d never leave
I think back as I took a puff
Know what happens every time you leave
Always come back ‘cause you wanna fuck
Always come back ‘cause you wanna fuss
Holdin’ back, ain’t no turnin’ back when you fall in love
Know what happens every time you speed
Always fall flat ‘cause you wanna rush
So we could take it slow
Separate the highs from the lows
Separate the evens from the odds
I just hope you put me back together when I come apart

[Chorus: Florence Welch]
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can’t stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can’t last forever
Can’t last forever

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
I woke up today high
Felt a little less pressure from you
And I’m here to say I
Maybe even learned a lesson from you
If you find a way to fight the pain which we endure
If you fly away then rest assured

[Chorus: Florence Welch]
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can’t stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can’t last forever
Can’t last forever

[Bridge: Florence Welch]
You’re the eye, but I’m tearing all the time
Always there to catch me, but I’m never coming down
Reconstructing all the pieces I left in my way
I guess you know, in control
Chaos I create
I come apart

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
You made a bet with me, now you’re in debt with me
Made my bed, lied in it, then you slept with me
It’s ruthless, she the closest thing next to me
The truth is, that she blew it and you left with me
Especially hard to express to me
European attitude but born in West Philly
She just have a smokin’ ‘gina, where the Wet Willies?
I come apart, I’m in her heart on her left titty

[Chorus: Florence Welch]
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can’t stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can’t last forever
Can’t last forever
Taylor made money gang

And I ain't even pressed
Got you feelin under-dressed
Any time you find him in the building

Got some Gucci Chuck Tay's
You ain't seen yet
Yellow ice so I may seem fresh
But if you did what I'm doin
Nigga you'd be feeling spoiled rotten
In my city I've got pull
So don't tug
Or get drugged through the mud probably
Like my weed rolled
My steak done properly
I put my team on
Now we own property
And my swag so official
No magazine so my cash not an issue
Tell the ref to throw a flag
Blow the whistle
Cuz your styles out of date
That's a foul on the play
And your words don't hurt him
Because I'm flying out the way
What you make a month I probably spent today
Pyewm

[Verse 1]
Oh, morning come bursting the clouds, amen
Lift off this blindfold, let me see again
Bring back the water, let your ships roll in
In my heart, she left a hole
The tightrope that I’m walking just sways and ties
The Devil as he's talking with those angel's eyes
And I just want to be there when the lightning strikes
And the saints go marching in

[Chorus]
And sing
Slow it down
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world

[Verse 2]
Like a river to a raindrop, I lost a friend
My drunken hazard Daniel in a lion's den
And tonight, I know it all has to begin again
So whatever you do, don’t let go
And if we could float away
Fly up to the surface and just start again
Lift off before trouble just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us and see roses in the rain, saying

[Chorus]
Slow it down
Slow it down
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world

[Outro]
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world

[Verse 1]
Mommas oldest, dads brightest
But youngin still thugging
What was it that bad guidance
Love him he's God gift
Though they hate I love it
It make me drive faster
They won't catch the F50 Ferrari
I got on Ferrari glasses
Mashing through New Orleans like it's Cali
I'm just trying to keep up with the fashions
Got my music blasting
Televisions flashing
I'm watching The Passion
Me I get my hot box game up when I flame up
Shame lil niggas at the red light change up
See everyone was around when I was down
Now it's lonely at the top since I came up
Look up, they trying to look me up and hook up look
I ain't got a nose for your boogers I'm sugar
That mean I'm good, if you is I'm gooder
Should of would of could of but you didn't cocksucker
This is that old south I'm talking with that old slang
Pushing that new thing, shitting on my old hoes
Pissing off my old homies
The game is fair but it's cold get your winter garments
Still can't warm it
See I'm a break from the norm
My LA girls they say I’m so bomb, they eat tofu
The 40/40 on a special day
Them cheap niggas I'll still slide 500 to Desiree
I talk shit and I don't never hate
Cause I would forklift whoever face
See I ain't rich yet
Oh but I'm ballin now and that get your bitch wet
We just trying to see how many dicks she can bench press
See I'm a business
Dogs I’m a bitchness
I ain't a rest haven I let the rest save them
Mack Maine hit me with the trap game
Now I'm having second thoughts about the fucking rap game
Hold up

[Verse 2]
Tez
Please get on my schedule let them know that I'm open
Pick a day when I'm free and put “beef”
C'mon, let them know I'm hoping they tripping
We could get it in motion you get to know physics
Leaving them in the ocean with pistols dripping
With all these bannana clips and we ain't slipping
Foggy behind the tints, good grief
So you blow o's of the leaf I blow a wreathe
Sheesh, Great Scott, is he a theif?
It seems like he got a mouth full of gold teeth
Chyea, shout out to Cee Lo Green
Young money we know green
Spitta say you no crazy
We got shit that you don't need
That's my nigga he fly, so now he keep me fly
And all the talk in the streets bout us is we be fly
My bitch be asking why I don't go suit and tie
Because they put that on you when you die

[Verse 1]
(Let's dance) put on your red shoes and dance the blues
(Let's dance) to the song they're playing on the radio
(Let's sway) while colour lights up your face
(Let's sway) sway through the crowd to an empty space

[Chorus]
If you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms and tremble like a flower

[Refrain]
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)

[Verse 2]
(Let's dance) for fear your grace should fall
(Let's dance) for fear tonight is all

(Let's sway) under the moonlight, this serious moonlight

[Chorus]
And if you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms and tremble like a flower

[Intro]
Check it out
It feels kinda crazy

[Verse 1]
These covers, may keep me warm at night
But they can't take your place
'Cause they're never gonna hold me tight
And these pillows, may let me rest my head
But they can't say goodnight
And tuck me in before I go to bed

[Pre-Chorus]
Saying nah, baby girl, you're better off
That's what I'm telling myself (Over and over)
But, I'm lying to myself
'Cause I know I don't want nobody else

[Chorus]
These lips are missing you
'Cause these lips ain't kissing you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again, these tears always win
These arms are wanting you
'Cause these arms ain't holding you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again, these tears always win

[Verse 2]
These candles light up my room at night
But they can't light the room the way you did
When you walked inside, nah baby
If these walls could sing about everything they’ve witnessed
It'd be a sad, sad song
And it'd probably sound something like this

[Pre-Chorus]
Saying nah, baby girl, you're better off
That's what I'm telling myself (Over and over)
But, I'm lying to myself
'Cause I know I don't want nobody else

[Chorus]
These lips are missing you (Missing you)
'Cause these lips ain't kissing you (Kissing you)
These eyes put up a fight
But once again, these tears always win
These arms are wanting you (Wanting you)
'Cause these arms ain't holding you (Holding you)
These eyes put up a fight
But once again, these tears always win

[Bridge]
Tell me when the hell this loneliness is gonna be over
(Gonna be over)
When everything in this room reminds me of you
Every time I think I'm getting closer
These tears dry me out, and once again, I lose

[Chorus]
These lips are missing you (Missing you)
Cause these lips ain't kissing you (Kissing you)
I put up a fight
But once again, these tears always win
These arms are wanting you (Wanting you)
Cause these arms ain't holding you (Holding you)
These eyes put up a fight
But once again, these tears always win

[Outro]
These eyes put up a fight
But once again, these tears always win
These eyes put up a fight
But once again, these tears always win
These eyes put up a fight
But once again, these tears always win

[Intro: Big Boi & Frank Ocean]
Remix
And the peaches and the mangos that you could sell for me

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
What do you think my brain is made for?
Is it just a container for the mind?
This great grey matter
Sensei replied, "What is your woman?
Is she just a container for the child?"
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, ohh
Close my eyes and fall into you, you, you
My God, she’s giving me pleasure
Oh, nah, nah

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter?
Sensei went quiet, then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh, oh
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My God, giving me pleasure, pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure over matter

[Verse 3: Big Boi & Andre 3000]
(Hey, hey) Yeah
Doesn't matter if she wanna be with me, so it's cool
I make her call me B.B. King because I give her the blues
But not on purpose though, she was the perfect ho-stess
When I come over, we would do the grossest
Most beautiful-est things on a bed of roses
Would be the coldest when you hit the hardwood floor
We sippin' 'Gnac, not mimosas
She's in my naked lap, goin' HAM like she supposed to
And she could make it clap if I told her
Or make her ass spread like the back of a cobra
Standin' at attention like a soldier
A G.I. Joe, man, see, me, I go in (Ask a bitch, nigga)
Yeah, that nigga goes up in it
Like smoke through a chimney (Hey, hey)
Slow stroke, 'cause she feelin' me up in her, nigga
Killin' me softly, raw dog, she wants me
Strong and black like her coffee, get off me
Act a donkey, I pin her tail to the mattress
I've been a player, make her go from classy to nasty
Nasty, nasty, nasty, nasty (Ha, ha, ha)
To sloosh (Hey, hey)

[Verse 4: André 3000]
Since you been gone, I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all, had to tell myself, "Naw
She better with some fella with a regular job"
I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner, Mr. Benjamin was sitting in awe
Hops into my car, drove far
Far’s too close and I remember my memory's no sharp
Butterknife, what a life, anyway
I'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I, Hemingway?
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern, not me, cousin
If models are made for modelin', thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend? I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Grey matter
Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice
Blue matter

[Outro: André 3000]
You're good at being bad (Yep)
You're bad at being good (Oh)
For Heaven's sakes, go to Hell
Kno-, knock on wood, hey
You're good at being bad (You're bad at being good)
You're bad at being good
(For Heaven's sakes, go to Hell, knock on wood)
For Heaven's sakes, go to Hell
Knock, knock, knock, knock on wood
Well frankly when that ocean so muh'fuckin' good
Make her swab the muh'fuckin' wood
Make her walk the muh'fuckin' plank
Make her rob a muh'fuckin' bank
With no mask on and a rusty revolver

[Verse 1]
Lay where you're layin'
Don't make a sound
I know they're watchin'
They're watchin'
All the commotion
The kiddie like play
Have people talkin'
Talkin'

[Chorus]
You!
Your sex is on fire

[Verse 2]
The dark of the alley
The breakin' of day
Head while I'm drivin'
I'm drivin'
Soft lips are open
Them knuckles are pale
Feels like you're dyin'
You're dyin'

[Chorus]
You!
Your sex is on fire
Consumed!
With what's just transpired

[Verse 3]
Hot as a fever
Rattle of Bones
I could just taste it
Taste it
If it's not forever
If it's just tonight
Oh, we're still the greatest
The greatest, the greatest

[Chorus]
You!
Your sex is on fire
You!
Your sex is on fire, ahh
Consumed!
With what's to transpire
And you!
Your sex is on fire
Consumed!
With what's to transpire

[Intro: Warren G]
Good morning nifnods and stoners
I would like to welcome you to Nathaniel L. High School
The home of the scholars
The home of the impalas
And the home of the rottweilers
I'm your counselors, Warren G

[Chorus: Latoiya Williams, Snoop Dogg & Both]
I'm just; soaking up this breeze, smoking on some trees
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
I get lifted, I get lifted (Everyday)
I get lifted, I get lifted
I get lifted, I get lifted (Everyday)
I get lifted, I get lifted, hey

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Overzel me, propel me, propeller, cat pilla
Rap healer, dope dealer, grip it back
Lick it back now, reseller
Exhale, inhaler, feller, Juicys pored
Dueces for all you loud mouth bitches who adore
I can't play on your field anymore
Take it flight, now look at me soar
In and out of space with my foot to the floor
Higher and higher, I won't retire
Halfie don Kaya, Love smokin fire tata like satellite
All on the wire
Keep it up, speed it up, slow it up
Throw it up
Your bitch is looking at me cause she probably wanna go with us
It's cool with me, hop in, hop in, ain't no stopping
We keep knocking, rocking

[Chorus: Latoiya Williams & Snoop Dogg & Both]
I'm just; soaking up this breeze, smoking on some trees
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need

I get lifted, I get lifted
I get lifted, I get lifted (Everyday)
I get lifted, I get lifted, hey

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Dimes, dubs, quarter ounce oz, put it in a zag
Let it burn slowly everywhere I am
Nigga got blow tree rolling every gram
They be like holy smokes, that man no joke
Can tell if it's that "mehh" (crap) if you don't choke
Never gonna quit, every chance I'm a toke
Zips smelling like the whole plants in my coat
For autographs, coming at me with all the names
And what I gotta have
I got my own shit, and this ain't for the little kid
This grown shit, having a party at my crib
Bring your own bitch, I got 3, so matter of fact you can take one
And roll a joint baby girl let's bake one
And take this weed and I can show you how to make one, uh

[Chorus: Latoiya Williams & Snoop Dogg,  Latoiya Williams & Snoop Dogg, Wiz Khalifa]
I'm just; soaking up this breeze, smoking on some trees
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
(Yeah, niggas know I get lifted man it's high school man)
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
(I stay high, I mean I don't gotta get high I'm already there)
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
(Yeah, I was high when I said that)
I get lifted, I get lifted (Everyday)
(Haha, what up Snoop!)
I get lifted, I get lifted
I get lifted, I get lifted (Everyday)
I get lifted, I get lifted, hey

[Chorus: Latoiya Williams & Snoop Dogg,  Latoiya Williams & Snoop Dogg, Wiz Khalifa]
I'm just; soaking up this breeze, smoking on some trees
I blame it on you, you blame it on me, we blame it on trees
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
I blame it on you, you blame it on me, we blame it on trees
I get lifted, I get lifted (Everyday)

I get lifted, I get lifted, hey

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]

[Verse 1]
Salty leave, salty leave
Tell me the one about the friend you knew
And the last good night that we toasted too
Salty leave
Stay for me, stay for me
We drank wine in the matinee
And the spotlight showed what it chased away
Stay for me

[Chorus]
She saw my comb over, her hourglass body
She has problems with drinking milk
And being school tardy
She'll loan you her toothbrush
She'll bar tend your party

[Verse 2]
Kill me, kill me
I called and called, but I can't get through
Said he's on his own, but his own is you
Kill me

[Chorus] 

[x2]
Hello muthafucker hey hi what is
Its Trigga and you know I came to snatch a niggas bitch
How shall I begin this, hopping outta benz's
Jumping on this track like a muthafuckin gymnast
2X

Bad to the bone, bitch nigga go home
Her body called me cuz she lost her phone
R&B's IV, hip hop saying c'mon
Then I heard her moan, "Honey I'm home"
Rolex under a fuckin ice pack
Facebook gangsters, you ain't gotta like that
Keep a couple niggas that'll take a charge for em
Dig a hole in the yard, send a nigga to God for em
Appetite hype and niggas is minute rice
I love her for the night
But really its kinda silly how chickens is getting wifed
Cause niggas is trickin right
Really livin the life
Niggas think they can see me be really I'm outta sight
Forgive me I'm kinda nice
Like a Fab ad-lib with a fat ass bitch
Toilet bowl ass niggas wish you had this shit
(Uhh) Lemme grab my dick
(Wooo) Who the fuck is you though?
I'm sicker than the flu though
I put this on the Bible
I want the highest title
And thats numero uno
I'm not a Puerto Rican but I'm speakin so that you know
And you niggas is bruno
It's Kanye West straight outta Chi-Town
Super producer brought you joints like
H to the Izzo, Takeover and that new Scarface single
And I'm chillin with the leader of the new school
Absolute heavy hitters y'all

[Intro]
Yo...
I'm Kanye To The, first of all coming straight from the Chi
Uh, I don't lie
It's like the singer say
I've been known to do beats like that, know what I'm saying
Brought you hits such as
Uh, Uh
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Gimme some brain before I hop up on this plane
Gotta head right back to the Chi

[Verse 1]
Now even though I went to college and dropped outta school quick
I always had a Ph.D.: a Pretty Huge Dick
Ladies tired of getting ripped off by guys like this
And giving head is like a whale that's using a toothpick
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time only
Two way or phone me, if you tryna bone me
Yo man got money, you still feel lonely
Claim he love you, it's no doubt, it's Gwen Stef-phony
You a light skinneded Nia, dark skinneded Tamia
Black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto senorita
You remind me of my Jeep, but not no Kia
We can talk on my cell, but not Nokia
It be going in and out that's why I barely hear ya
It be going in and out like a robberia
I'm tryna take this money like Rob and G-Dep
And I'mma take you to my house like Trick and Trina
Chi-Town, Chi-Town, big city of dreams
And my dick so big it can't fit in my jeans
And a bitch so mad she can't get in my cream
And it gets so bad she wanna tear up my things
But still

[Hook]
K-A-N-Y-E, Chi-Town playa out in NYC
She said she wanna go on a shopping spree
Bought her some cheap J.Lo jeans cuz the ass is free

[Verse 2]
I love girls, girls, I got a fetish for em
But not no lettuce for em
Dick and bad credit for em
Bills, bills, I know she tryna get paid
She know I'm tryna get laid
She figure that's an even trade off
If she a stewardess I show her to my cockpit
If she a lawyer then I give her Johnnie Cochran
If she wanna see me again
She better get 2 friends then maybe then
We'll have group sex, toothex
And a young girl off that X
And she just turned eight-teen
Last week she was against the law
So for her birthday I put this dick against her jaw
And like a picture in a frame put it against the wall
Said she had never been with a man before
But she not a virgin, huh, she a lady lover
I didn't know y'all take each other out and date each other
But that's a lady lover
I ain't even know that was ya baby mother

[Hook]

[Outro]
Explain the outro man, don't nobody never get to the outro
I just take a whole record and just
I'm not gonna talk about the producer shit right now
I just want niggas to realize my shit, you know what I'm saying
2002, aight
I sounded real mad on the last mixtape
I'm not even gonna go there this time, ok

[Intro]
KRS-One representing Ma 6T va Crack-er
Cercle Rouge, KRS-One
Droppin on em like this
Pick it up, pick it up
You know what time it is when KRS-One comes through
Representing all true hip hop culture
You know how we do

[Verse 1]
How can they throw you in prison now for long years
If in reality the black man doesn't belong here
Have you forgotten how we got to this place
Why then are all the jails predominantly the black race
If you dont teach me my culture I dont know who I am
I dont know the difference between my enemy and my friend
So I'm robbin and killin I got nothing to live for
You turn my father into a boy my mother into a whore
Now I'm hardcore on the Ave
Watching while people that got me to walk fast
After beatin us, rapin us and robbin us
400 years of that's what's inside of us
Take a look at me now I'm really your creation
A technological anti-human mutation
A mutation of a better way of life
You first pulled the knife but to heal it will take my whole life
I fought no force on this level
I listen to bass and treble
Thinking that the white man is the devil
Cause who could be so cruel like this
So heartless, so senseless
But I'm taught by the devil
To grow up and be a Devil
To do the same devilish things on another level
However when I act out the mission
You turn around and throw me in prison
You a sucker

[Hook: KRS-One]
If you come from France
And you like the breakdance say OHOH (OHOH)
And If you come from New York
And you like the way I talk say Yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
You can kill a man by taking him out of his land
And putting him in a land he really doesnt understand
Then teach him to respect Greek mythology like
Pythagorus, Ptolomies, Socrates
These people are thieves
They stole us astronomy, mathematics, all tactics of biology
Even the concept of democracy stolen from the king Akhanoton
Put down the book, use your brain
If you dont know who you are you are clinically insane
The board of education can't see that
Well it deserves to get beaten and robbed by black
Give me my frame of mind back
Give me my culture
But you dont understand that cause you a sucker

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I see Beauval in the house, Collinet in the house
Sarcelles in the house, Cercle Rouge in the house
KRS-One rocks the mike without a doubt
Turning parties out
You know what I am about
Cause we will be here forever I told you
Soldier floods your mind like Noah
As you get older you've got to pay attention
At how you livin hardcore
You ain't a kid anymore grow up, to blow up the spot you're at
Learn the skill and go to the top of that
Cercle Rouge definitely rockin in rap
KRS-One I got your back

[Hook]

[Outro]
KRS-One with the freestyle rhyme
Representing Cercle Rouge in France
All the graffiti artists
We like to breakdance to the MC yes you know that's me
KRS-One down with the BDP
From way back you know we take it like that
Kenny P and Zizwe, Will-Dee, gods of rap
We do it like this, do it like that

[Verse 1]
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

[Verse 2]
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run

[Outro]
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here

[Chorus]
I'm on the rock and then I check a stock
I have to run like a fugitive to save the life I live
I'm going to be Iron like a Lion in Zion
I'm going to be Iron like a Lion in Zion
Iron Lion Zion

[Verse]
I'm on the run but I have got no gun
See they want to be the star
So they fighting tribal war
And they saying Iron like a Lion in Zion
Iron like a Lion in Zion
Iron Lion Zion

[Chorus]
I'm on the rock, running and you running
I take a stock, running like a fugitive
I had to run like a fugitive just to save the life I live
I am going to be Iron like a Lion in Zion
I am going to be Iron like a Lion in Zion

[Outro]
Iron Lion Zion, Iron Lion Zion, Iron Lion Zion
Iron like a Lion in Zion, Iron like a lion in Zion
Iron Like a Lion in Zion

[Mike Shinoda]
Yo, y’all better wake up; you think we don’t see y’all drifting?
Sleeping on the job and forgetting your position? (position)
Sit straight and listen; what you are missing
I cook up a batch, hot straight out the kitchen
No indecision, I spit right
Heavy as a fist fight
No gloves and no masks
No pain and no slack
No way to look back
Nobody to say I can’t make my own path
Cause the way that y’all act, I wanna break something
Comin’ at me like the pain I feel means nothing
Comin’ from a place where you can’t relate
Where every word from your face comes across as fake
And I can hardly take, the way that y’all treat us
Sending this out to anyone who won’t believe us
Spelling it out so y’all know the deal
And if you can’t feel it, maybe you can’t feel

[Hook: Motion Man]
I’m standing in the middle of it
Middle of it
Middle of it
Man, who are you?
I’m standing in the middle of it
Middle of it
Middle of it
What are you saying?
I’m standing in the middle of it
Middle of it
Middle of it
What are you writing?
I’m standing in the middle of it
Middle of it
Middle of it
Man, who are you?

[Motion Man]
(Tell ‘em, Motion)
Eat your words
Say what you used to say and act how you used to act
Every time you heard my occupation was a rap attack (rap attack)
My conversation’s stacked, I switch my defense on you
Every time you want to get deep you’ll see my knuckle package
Born to die, ferocious emcee make you go back and write your rhymes
My style chokes up like a little league baseball player
It moves, I’m strangling as I’m swinging as main mangler
I wanna dee-four, poach you as your seafood is C4
I’m gonna rap and you still knee-high
Y’all wanna train with me, guy?
Man, it’s destructive
Man, it’s like jabs from boxing champ Lennox
Perfect for your head, I’ll fit it like New Era hats
That top off suits, B-boy etiquette
Express myself with my hang-side
Then I extend one finger, the middle to fucking all crouds

[Hook]

[Mike Shinoda]
Yo, Motion (yeah?)
Sometimes I feel it’s like nothing that I do's ever good enough (for real)
Like I should stop and go back to L.A
Back away where I know I won’t be seen
And nobody’s gonna critique the music that I make
And mistake me for some fucking kid with a backpack
Rapping on a track just to make a buck
For a mix-tape that sucks
And DJ's that don’t get it
But I been down that road and I know
People don’t wanna go where I might go
Don’t wanna know what it’s like
To step outside your zone with a mic
Just controlling the hype
And if we need to take shots from them
And be stopped by them just to meet these ends
Then so be it, I will not hold my breath
I’m gonna spit ‘til I got none left
Motion, where you at?

[Hook]

[Chorus]
I've been kicking it with your girlfriend (oh)
What am I gonna do? (oh)
Cause God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you (ohh-ouu)
I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth
(Ohh-ouu) I fell in love with her the moment we were introduced
And I just feel that it's time for this little secret to end
Baby, I'm kicking it with your girlfriend

Ohh, ohh, ohh-ouu, ohh ohh ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh-ouu, ohh ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh-ouu, ohh ohh ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh-ouu, ohh ohh

[Verse 1]
Go on and slap me again, cause I can understand how you feel
When a man takes you for granted and he don't keep it real
I should've been more man and told you a long time ago
Instead of stunting I should have broke it down and let you know
Girl my fault for that, don't know what's on my mind
And I blame myself for wasting your time
Believe, I really tried to keep that girl away from me
But her body language kept on tempting and teasing me
And plus she knew what she was doing, did it anyway
I knew what she was doing too and that made it okay
Truth is, is that we don't even regret it
Up out the closet I will be the first to say it

[Chorus]
I've been kicking it with your girlfriend (oh)
What am I gonna do? (oh)
'Cause God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you (ohh-ouu)
I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth
(Ohh-ouu) I fell in love with her the moment we were introduced
And I just feel that it's time for this little secret to end
Baby, I'm kicking it with your girlfriend
Ohh, ohh, ohh-ouu, ohh ohh ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh-ouu

[Verse 2]
Now I apologize for me and her and everything that went down
These are the reasons why some girls don't bring they friends around
I just didn't know how to tell you that I was feeling her
And how we would get away sometimes and make love
I never wanted to mislead you (lead you)
At first I just wanted to please you (please you)
I know it's hard for you to be able to trust again
'Cause I came between you and your best friend
I did not ask for this
It just happened outta nowhere ever since the day we kissed
And the, truth is, is that we don't even regret it
Up out the closet I will be the first to say it

[Chorus]
I've been kicking it with your girlfriend (oh)
What am I gonna do? (oh)
'Cause God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you (ohh-ouu)
I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth
(Ohh-ouu) I fell in love with her the moment we were introduced
And I just feel that it's time for this little secret to end
Baby, I'm kicking it with your girlfriend (oh)

[Bridge]
(I'm sorry again) Never meant to hurt you
(I'm sorry again) But girl I love her
(I'm sorry again) I never meant to make you cry, no
Now right up out the closet

[Chorus]
I've been kicking it with your girlfriend (oh)
What am I gonna do? (oh)
'Cause God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you (ohh-ouu)
I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth
(Ohh-ouu) I fell in love with her the moment we were introduced
And I just feel that it's time for this little secret to end
Baby, I'm kicking it with your girlfriend (yeah, hey)

I've been kicking it with your girlfriend (oh)
What am I gonna do? (oh)
'Cause God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you (ohh-ouu)
I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth
(Ohh-ouu) I fell in love with her the moment we were introduced
And I just feel that it's time...

[Verse 1]
There's a fog upon L.A
And my friends have lost their way
"We'll be over soon," they said
Now, they've lost themselves instead

[Chorus]
Please, don't be long
Please, don't you be very long
Please, don't be long
For I may be asleep

[Verse 2]
Well, it only goes to show
And I told them where to go
Ask a policeman on the street
There's so many there to meet

[Chorus]
Please, don't be long (Don't be long)
Please, don't you be very long (Don't be long)
Please, don't be long
Or I may be asleep

[Verse 3]
Now, it's past my bed I know (Know)
And I'd really like to go (Go)
Soon will be the break of day (Day)
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way (Way)

[Chorus]
Please, don't be long
Please, don't you be very long
Please, don't be long
Or I may be asleep
Please, don't be long
Please, don't you be very long
Please, don't be long
Please, don't be long
Please, don't you be very long
Please, don't be long
Please, don't be long
Please, don't you be very long
Please, don't be long

Don't be long, don't be long
Don't be long, don't be long
Don't be long, don't be long
Don't be long, don't be long

I can't wait 'til I get you on the floor, good-lookin'
Going hot, so hot, just like an oven
And ow! Burned myself, but just had to touch it
And it's so fine, and it's all mine
Hey, baby, we don't mind all the watchin' (High)

They might learn somethin'
She ain't nothin' but a little doozy when she does it
She's so fire tonight

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines

And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things (Show you a few things)

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie

All black at the white shows
White shoes at the black shows
Green card for the Cuban links
Y'all sit back and enjoy the light show
Nothing exceeds like excess
Stoute got gout from having the best of the best
Is this what it's all about? I'm at the rest-
-aurant with my rant disturbing the guests
Years of distress, tears on the dress
Try to hide her face with some makeup sex
Uh!
This is truffle season
Tom Ford tuxedos for no reason
All Saints for my angel, Alexander Wang too
Ass-tight denim and some Dunks
I'll show you how to do this young, uh!
No papers, catch vapors
Get high, out Vegas
D'USSÉ's on doubles, ain't looking for trouble
You just got good genes so a nigga tryna cuff you
Tell your mother that I love her 'cause I love you
Tell your father we go farther as a couple
They ain't lose a daughter, got a son
I show you how to do this, huh! Uh

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things (Show you a few things)
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things (Show you a few things)
Let me show you a few things (A few things)
Show you a few things about love, love, love
Let me show you a few things (A few things)
Show you a few things about love, hey
Oh!

[Outro: Justin Timberlake]
I hope this gets to you the right way. It’s the only way I know to do it. Some people may criticize me for the last 3 days. But it was fun, right?? Right?!?! Besides, I’d rather speak directly to all of you. And, who can knock me for having a little bit of fun with it?



Well… No more teasing. Although, it was A LOT of fun. (Did I mention that I’m having fun with this?? Ha!)

*Makes a serious face*



So, here goes:



This year is an exciting one for me. As you probably have heard through the “grapevine,” I’m gearing up for a big 2013

Back in June of last year, I quietly started working on what is now, my next journey with that thing I love called MUSIC

The inspiration for this really came out of the blue and to be honest, I didn’t expect anything out of it. I just went into the studio and started playing around with some sounds and songs. It was probably the best time I’ve had in my career…


Just creating with no rules and/or end goal in mind and really enjoying the process



What I came up with is something I couldn’t be more excited about! It is full of inspiration that I grew up listening to and some newfound muses that I’ve discovered along the way



I’m calling it “The 20/20 Experience,” and it’s coming out this year



I hope you enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoyed making it



That’s all I’m giving you for now… I know, I know! Again, with the teasing!!!



Get ready. This is going to be fun (well, at least it is for me)

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
I be on my suit and tie shit, tie shit, tie
I be on my suit and tie shit, tie shit
Can I show you a few things?
A few things, a few things, little baby cause
I be on my suit and tie shit, tie shit
I be on my suit and tie shit, tie shit
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things

[Verse 1]

LES

[Timbaland] Wait a minute. You ready, JT?

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
I can't wait til I get you on the floor, good-looking
Going out so hot, just like an oven
And I'll burn myself, but just had to touch it
It's so fly and it's all mine
Hey baby, we don't mind all the watching
Cause if they study close, real close
They might learn something
She ain't nothing but a little doozy when she does it
She's so fly tonight

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'mma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines

All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
While we’re in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
Hey

[Verse 3: Justin Timberlake]
Stop, let me get a good look at it
So thick, now I know why they call it a fatty
Shit so sick got a hit and picked up a habit
That's alright, cause you're all mine
Go on and show 'em who you call daddy
I guess they're just mad cause girl, they wish they had it
My killer, my filler, yeah you're a classic
And you're all mine tonight

[Hook]

[Justin Timberlake] Hey, get out ya seat, Hov

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
All black at the white shows
White shoes at the black shows
Green card for the Cuban linx
Y'all sit back and enjoy the light show
Nothing exceeds like the sex
Style got gout from having the best of the best
Is this what it's all about?
I'm at the restaurant with my rent
Disturbing the guests
Years of distress, tears on the dress
Try to hide her face with some makeup sex
This is trouble season
Tom Ford tuxedos for no reason
All saints for my angel
Alexander Wang too
Ass-tight Denim and some Dunks
I'll show you how to do this young!
No papers, catch favors
Get high, out Vegas
? ain't looking for trouble
You just got good genes so a nigga tryna cuff you
Tell your mother that I love her cause I love you
Tell your father we go farther as a couple
They ain't lose a daughter, got a son
I show you how to do this, hun!

[Verse 1]
Hey lady, you got the love I need
Maybe more than enough
Oh darling, darling, darling; walk a while with me
Oh, you've got so much, so much, so much

[Verse 2]
Many have I loved, and many times been bitten
Many times I've gazed along the open road
Many times I've lied, and many times I've listened
Many times I've wondered how much there is to know
Many dreams come true, and some have silver linings
I live for my dream and a pocketful of gold

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Mellow is the man who knows what he's been missing
Many, many men can't see the open road
Many is a word that only leaves you guessing
Guessing 'bout a thing you really ought to know, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Really ought to know (oh, oh, oh)
I really ought to know
Oh, you know I should, you know I should
You know I should've known

[Verse 1]
If you get lost, boy, then I will find you
You'll be my rock boy and I will climb you
But you don't notice me, it's like I'm not even here

[Hook]
I see you in the A, I see you in the Bay,
I see you everyday, but I don't know what to say
So I'll be at the ball till 12 o'clock A
I'll be your Cinderella-ella (Aye)
Then maybe you and maybe me
Can maybe meet and m-m-make a baby
Then maybe you and me
Can meet and make a baby, let's make a baby
Let's make a bay, l-l-lets make a baby
Let's make a bay, l-l-lets make a baby
Let's make a bay, l-l-lets make a baby
Let's make a bay, l-l-lets make a baby

[Verse 2]
I'll be your sun, boy, and I will guide you
You'll be my wave and I'll always ride you
And I'll give anything to prove that I really care

[Hook]
I see you in the A, I see you in the Bay,
I see you everyday, but I don't know what to say
So I'll be at the ball till 12 o'clock A
I'll be your Cinderella-ella (Aye)
Then maybe you and maybe me
Can maybe meet and m-m-make a baby
Then maybe you and me
Can meet and make a baby, let's make a baby
Let's make a bay, l-l-lets make a baby
Let's make a bay, l-l-lets make a baby
Let's make a bay, l-l-lets make a baby
Let's make a bay, l-l-lets make a baby

[Verse 3]
When they seen the girl stuntin', they thought that I was frontin'
I'm not Kanye but you can't tell me nothin'
I've been around the world from London to Japan
I'm on the l-l-lear, l-l-looking for my man
Cause, ooh, he so gutter, he m-m-make me stutter
The French Vanilla truck's inside peanut butter
The girls wanna see him, the boys wanna be him
Get payed like per diem from the a.m. to the p.m
So where the fuck's the flashlight? Where are my binoculars?
Somebody go tell him I get wetter than tilapias
And I am bi-populars, oops, I mean bipolar
Search the whole solar, (ain't a bitch colder)

[Hook]
I see you in the A, I see you in the Bay,
I see you everyday, but I don't know what to say
So I'll be at the ball till 12 o'clock A
I'll be your Cinderella-ella (Aye)
Then maybe you and maybe me
Can maybe meet and m-m-make a baby
Then maybe you and me
Can meet and make a baby, let's make a baby
Let's make a bay, l-l-lets make a baby
Let's make a bay, l-l-lets make a baby
Let's make a bay, l-l-lets make a baby
Let's make a bay, l-l-lets make a baby

[Chorus]
Let me take you to the movie
Can I take you to the show?
Let me be yours ever truly
Can I make your garden grow?

[Verse 1]
From the houses of the holy
We can watch the white doves go
From the door comes Satan's daughter
And it only goes to show

[Hook]
You know

[Verse 2]
There's an angel on my shoulder
In my hand a sword of gold
Let me wander in your garden
And the seeds of love I'll sow

[Hook]
You know

[Verse 3]
So the world is spinning faster
Are you dizzy when you stall?
Let the music be your master
Will you heed the master's call?
Oh, Satan and man

[Verse 4]
Said there ain't no use in crying
Cause it will only, only drive you mad
Does it hurt to hear them lying?
Was this the only world you had? Oh, oh

[Chorus]
So let me take you, take you to the movie
Can I take you, baby, to the show?
Why don't you let me be yours ever truly
Can I make your garden grow?

[Hook]
You know, that's right

[Intro: Macklemore]
Ladies and gentlemans
This an ode to the B-boys, B-girls
The people out there who do it for the love
And believe me I'm not dissin' anybody out there who's trying to get paid
I'm trying to get paid too!
But I got one question

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Whatever happened to the heart?
That pumped the passion into the art?
The entity that gave you the energy to wanna start?
Breakdancing, I'm battling, doing it at the park
Where the mission was expression, not only to top charts
I don't know what happened, wanting to blow rap
You lose soul and passion for the flows and the tracks
Radio's lacking, controlled by fascists, assholes doing damage
But we're gonna take it back
Before beats to a hundred G's a pop
All you needed was a tabletop and a beatbox
Hip-hop without the B-boy is like shelltoes only having two stripes
Hip-hop, we're freedom-fighting, graffiti-writing, party types
That recite and organize and revitalize our rhyming
'Til the group of the moneymakers systems
Knows that the industry can eventually get served
Breakers of my verses spinning up a revolution throughout our words
If you really want it, come on get it, cause I've got it
I'm honestly paying homage to forgotten pioneers of this culture that are giving them props and learn
If you wanna earn your stripes
You gotta be able to rock this mic and set cyphers alike
The feeling to put in everything you got in the circle
Will never be documented in the Coke commercial

[Hook: Macklemore]
We be the baddest

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Now B-boys, B-girls
Bring it back to the block
Lemme see you get ill, for real, pop and lock!
If you record without thought then stop
Because I'll serve your whole album with the goddamn beatbox
Without thought it just happens
If you gotta think to feel, that's not rapping, that's acting
I'm from a land of backpacks and fat cats
MCs with sick raps who serve those that are wack
It's a way of life
I put all my energy into the melody
On the mp3s until the death of me
Record exceptionally, especially
Whenever I be monumentally, grammatically, killing the mic
I tell my DJs, cranking that music, keeping 'em moving when the beat plays
Staying into it, breaking and grooving, and MCs they
Thinking that you should always pursue in what their dreams make
Taking from lucid to really do it
All the people gotta make their money
And the way to make money is to get inside of the industry
Take it on the radio, flow
So you can go blow, we get a car
And a crib up on MTV
But in the end what's classic?
Radio bubblegum? Or a voice filled with passion?
To my real hip-hop heads, please stand up
Cause the only people that can preserve this art is us

[Verse 1]
Her face is cracked from smiling
All the fears that she's been hiding
And it seems that pretty soon everybody's gonna know
And her voice is sore from shouting
Cheering winners who are losing
And she worries if their days are few
And soon they'll have to go

[Chorus]
My, my, my, I'm so happy
I'm gonna join the band
We' gonna dance and sing in celebration
We're in the promised land

[Verse 2]
She hears them talk of new ways
To protect the home she lives in
Then she wonders what it's all about
When they break down the door
Her name is Brown or White or Black
You know her very well
You hear her cries of mercy
As the winners toll the bell

[Chorus]
My, my, my, I'm so happy
I'm gonna join the band, yeah
We' gonna sing and dance in celebration
We're in the promised land

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Oooh, there is a train that leaves the station
Heading for your destination
But the price you pay to nowhere
Has increased a dollar more. Yes, it has!
And if you walk, you're gonna get there
And though it takes a little longer
And when you see it in the distance
You will wring your hands and moan, oh, yeah, moan
Ooh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, moan moan

[Ad libs continue]

[Outro]
If you walk you're gonna get there
Though it takes a little longer
And when you see it in the distance
You will wring your hands and moan...

[Verse 1]
Bright light almost blinding
Black night still there shining
I can't stop, keep on climbing
Looking for what I knew
Had a friend, she once told me
“You got love, you ain't lonely”
Now she's gone and left me only
Looking for what I knew

[Chorus]
Mmm, I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy, just…

[Verse 2]
Met a man on the roadside crying
Without a friend, there's no denying
You're incomplete, they'll be no finding
Looking for what you knew
So anytime somebody needs you
Don't let them down, although it grieves you
Someday you'll need someone like they do
Looking for what you knew

[Chorus]
Mmm, I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy, just….oh, yeah…
I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy, It's very easy
It's very easy, It's easy, easy, yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh!
Been working from seven
To eleven every night
Really makes life a drag
I don't think that's right

[Verse 1]
I've really been the best, the best of fools
I did what I could, yeah
'Cause I love you, baby, how I love you, darling
How I love you, baby, my beloved little girl, little girl

[Chorus]
But, baby, since I've been loving you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Everybody trying to tell me
That you didn't mean me no good
I've been trying, Lord, let me tell you
Let me tell you, I really did the best I could

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been, I've been working from seven
To eleven every night
I said it kinda makes my life a drag, drag, drag, drag
Lord, yeah, that ain't right, now, now

[Chorus]
Since I've been loving you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind
Watch out

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
I said I've been crying, yeah
Oh, my tears, they fell like rain
Don't you hear them, don't you hear them falling?
Don't you hear them, don't you hear them falling?

[Verse 3]
Do you remember, mama, when I knocked upon your door?
I said you had the nerve to tell me
You didn't want me no more, yeah
I open my front door, I hear my back door slam
You know, I must have one of them newfangled
Newfangled back-door men
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been a-working from seven, seven, seven
To eleven every night
It kinda makes my life a drag, a drag, drag
Ah yeah! It makes it a drag

[Chorus]
Baby, since I've been loving you
I'm about to lose, I'm about to lose, lose my worried mind
Just one more, just one more, ooh, yeah
Since I've been loving you, I'm gonna lose my worried mind

[Verse 1]
As I walk down the highway
All I do is sing a song
And a train that's passin' my way
Helps the rhythm move along

There is no doubt about the words are clear
The voice is strong, it's oh so strong

I'm just a simple guy
I live from day to day
A ray of sunshine melts my frown
And blows my blues away

There's nothing more that I can say
But on a day like today I pass the time away
And walk a quiet mile with you

[Chorus]
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
Oooh yeah, oooh yeah
Oooh yeah, oooh yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm so glad I'm leaving
Gonna tell the world I am
I got me a fine woman
And she says that I'm her man

One thing that I know for sure
Gonna give her all the loving
Like nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody can

Standing in the noonday sun
Trying to flag a ride
People go, and people come
See my rider right by my side

It's a total disgrace, they set the pace
It must be a race, and the best thing I can do is run

[Chorus]
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
Oooh yeah, oooh yeah
Oooh yeah, oooh yeah

[Outro]
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah
Oh, da da da 70 more
All I do is say let's keep on
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Aah ah ah yeah yeah
Aaaahhh yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while
I think I see my friends coming, riding many a mile
Friends, you get some silver?
Did you get a little gold?
What did you bring me, my dear friends
To keep me from the gallows pole?
What did you bring me to keep me from the gallows pole?
I couldn't get no silver, I couldn't get no gold
You know that we're too damn poor to keep you from the gallows pole

[Verse 2]
Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while
I think I see my brother coming, riding many a mile
Brother, you get me some silver?
Did you get a little gold?
What did you bring me, my brother, to keep me from the gallows pole?
Brother, I brought you some silver, yeah
I brought a little gold, I brought a little of everything
To keep you from the gallows pole
Yes, I brought you to keep you from the gallows pole

[Verse 3]
Hangman, hangman, turn your head awhile
I think I see my sister coming, riding many a mile, mile, mile
Sister, I implore you, take him by the hand
Take him to some shady bower
Save me from the wrath of this man
Please take him, save me from the wrath of this mad man
Hangman, hangman, upon your face a smile
Tell me that I'm free to ride
Ride for many a mile, mile, mile

[Verse 4]
Oh yes, you got a fine sister
She warmed my blood from cold
She warmed my blood to boiling hot
To keep you from the gallows pole, pole, pole, pole, yeah, yeah
Your brother brought me silver, and your sister warmed my soul
But now I laugh and pull so hard, see you swinging on the gallows pole, yeah
But now I laugh and pull so hard, see you swinging on the gallows pole, pole, pole
Swingin' on the gallows pole!
Swingin' on the gallows pole!
Swingin' on the gallows pole!
Swingin' on the gallows pole
Pole, pole, pole, pole, pole, pole, yeah

[Outro]
Ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha
It was swingin', it was swingin', it was swingin'
Mamamamamamama, yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha, ah-ha
Swingin' on the gallows, yeah
Swingin' on the gallows pole!
Swingin' on the gallows pole!
Swingin' on the, ah
I gotta swing!
See-saw marjory daw
I gotta swing!
See-saw, knock at my door
I gotta sing
Keep on singing, yeah
Keep it cooling, yeah
Keep it-
Aw yeah!

[Verse 1]
Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end
And it's been waitin' for you to open up yours, too
Baby, come on now, I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me

[Chorus]
That's made you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you

[Post-Chorus]
You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you, it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with tryin' to play me, yeah?

[Verse 2]
Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough?
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm takin' these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest, you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hopin' one day I might hear you say

[Chorus]
I make you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you

[Post-Chorus]
You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you, it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with tryin' to play me, yeah?

[Bridge]
But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me, more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak of runnin' around
And I will do until I'm findin' myself with you

[Chorus]
And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me, the one for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Produced by Mark Ronson]

[Verse 1]
You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been, then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it 'round on me like it's my fault
See, I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time (each and every time)

[Chorus]
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her

[Verse 2]
These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it and you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too when

[Chorus]
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her

[Bridge]
Time and time again, I play the role of fool
(Just for you)
And even in the daylight when you think that
(I don't see you)
I try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Though I do know how you play

[Chorus]
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her

[Verse 1]
Found myself today singin' out loud your name
You said I'm crazy, if I am, I'm crazy for you
Sometimes sittin' in the dark, wishin' you were here
Turns me crazy, but it's you who makes me lose my head

[Pre-Chorus]
And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head and
Turn me into a crumblin' fool

[Chorus]
Tell me to run and I'll race
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you want me gone, I'll leave
Just hold me closer, baby
And make me crazy for you
Crazy for you

[Verse 2]
Lately with this state I'm in, I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over, send me spinning closer to you
My, oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare and gets me into my favourite mood

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away
But the more I do
The crazier I turn into

[Chorus]
Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me, boy
Because I'm too crazy for you
Crazy for you

[Verse 1]
So little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth, the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry

Forgive me, first love, but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why
Don't get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes
It's bribing me to doubt myself
Simply, it's tiring

[Verse 2]
This love has dried up, and stayed behind
And if I stay, I'll be a lie
Then choke on words I'd always hide
Excuse me, first love, but we're through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new
Forgive me, first love, but I'm too tired
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire

[Outro]
Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love
Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love, forgive me
Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love

[Verse 1]
Walking in the park just the other day, baby
What do you, what do you think I saw?
Crowds of people sitting on the grass with flowers in their hair said
"Hey, boy, do you wanna score?"
And you know how it is?
I really don't know what time it was
Woah, oh, oh
So I asked them if I could stay a while

[Verse 2]
I didn't notice, but it had got very dark, and I was really
Really out of my mind
Just then a policeman stepped up to me
Asked us said please, hey, would we care
To all get in line, get in line?
Well, you know, they asked us to stay for tea and have some fun
Oh, oh, oh
He said that his friends would all drop by, ooh

[Verse 3]
Why don't you take a good look at yourself
And describe what you see?
And baby, baby, baby, do you like it?
There you sit, sitting spare like a book on a shelf rusting
Ah! Not trying to fight it
You really don't care if they're coming?
Oh, oh, oh
I know that it's all a state of mind, ooh (No, no, no!)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
If you go down in the streets
Today, baby, you better
You better open your eyes, woah yeah
Folk down there really don't care
Really don't care, don't care, really don't
Which, which way the pressure lies
So I've decided what I'm going to do now
So I'm packing my bags for the Misty Mountains
Where the spirits go now
Over the hills where the spirits fly
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Outro]
I really don't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I really don't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I really don't know

[Intro]
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye

[Chorus]
You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving nothing way too much, in fact
I say we've only known each other a year
You say, "*Pfft*, I've known you longer, my dear"
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other, think we'll never match at all
But we do, but we do, do-do-do
But we do, but we do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do

[Verse]
I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more
I've never known this, never before
You're the first to make up whenever we argue
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative
You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining
You'd think we wouldn't, we do, but we do, do-do-do
But we do, but we do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do

[Bridge]
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Your, your-your, your
Your, your-your, your...
Favoritism ain't my thing but
In this situation, I'll be glad
Favoritism ain't my thing but
In this situation, I'll be glad to make an exception (Woah, oh)

[Chorus]
You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving nothing way too much, in fact
I say we've only known each other a year
You say, "*Pfft*, I've known you longer, my dear"
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other, think we'll never match at all
But we do

[Verse 1]
Who wants to be right as rain?
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes, and you're on your own
You can say, "I chose to be alone"
Who wants to be right as rain?
It's harder when you're on top

[Chorus]
'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

[Verse 2]
Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down?
You give up everything you are
And even then, you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things

[Chorus]
See, when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now, I've had enough of (love)

[Bridge]
Go ahead and steal my heart to make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt as much it did then
When we were both right, and no one had blame
But now, I give up on this endless game

[Verse 3]
'Cause who wants to be right as rain?
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes, and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain?
It's harder when you're on top

[Chorus]
'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now, I've had enough of—

[Outro]
No room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now, I've had enough of love

[Verse 1]
Hold my hand
While you cut me down
It'd only just begun
But now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments
With your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle
Watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes
You were smiling in the spotlight
Dancing with the night
The night fell off your mind

[Chorus]
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired

[Verse 2]
Where'd you go
When you stay behind
I looked up and inside down
And outside only to find
A double taking, punching hard
And laughing at my smile
I get closer
You obviously prefer her

[Chorus]
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Hey, I'm tired

[Bridge]
I should have known

[Verse 3]
Never mind
Said your open arms
I couldn't help believe
It tricked me back into them

[Chorus]
Even though I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired

[Intro]
Take 'em to church

[Verse 1]
Momma don't cry
I know papa gone away
Grandpa gone and grandma ain't coming home today
But
Don't worry cause your son’s still the one
Though I'm under the gun I'm aiming for the sun
Dwayne Micheal Jr, born that
But I changed my name to Wayne
And nigga I ain't goin back
I'm kinda little but I figured I’d be bigger if I sold crack
So I sold that
OG’s from the block told me "Youngin hold that"
So I held dat
Got on front street and then I fell back
Became well at cookin it til it smell flat
Vaseline it up and ship it out in gel packs
I failed at what the teacher used to yell about
Junior High was prison
High school was the bail out
But my momma knew her baby boy was fresher
Than a baby bottom in new Pampers on campus

[Chorus]
This that boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Fresh just hit me with that (He hit me in my face)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
But can you bless me with that (Bless me in my chest)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Aye, Fresh, just hit me with that
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
(Play me in my head, play me in my head)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Fresh just hit me with that (He hit me in my face)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
But can you bless me with that (Bless me in my chest)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
(Cause I'ma kill 'em with the flow, I'ma kill 'em with the flow)

[Verse 2]
My Mama Mia ain't raise no Fredo
And Rabbit showed me how to make more out of quelo
You gotta make that thing flow like a ?
And keep getting money like I'm on the payroll
And if anybody slowing the payroll
I gotta turn his fitted cap to a halo
So get adapt to the case loads of crack
The yayo, the smack
The face blows, the gats
Photogenic, we expose a rat
And turn that ho into tomatoes or plants
And yeah I smoke back to back to back
Like I’m on two tracks but you ain't feeling that
I'm ducking the county boys with they billy bats
I got my dogs with me lookin out for silly cats
Ball with me
Weezy where the city at
And If I fall stay up
Cuz I’ma get it back

[Chorus]
This that boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Fresh just hit me with that (He hit me in my face)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
But can you bless me with that (Bless me in my chest)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Aye, Fresh, just hit me with that
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
(Play me in my head, play me in my head)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Fresh just hit me with that (He hit me in my face)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
But can you bless me with that (Bless me in my chest)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
(Cause I'ma kill 'em with the flow, I'ma kill 'em with the flow)

[Verse 3]
People always tell me I'm heavy I say believe that
But I don't get all full off the feedback
I'm where the G's at
We like “where the G’s at?”
Kick door, hands high or get your knees blacked
If I don't take everything I'ma be back
And I'm stickin to my word like bees wax
He acts an asshole for these stacks
C Notes not B Flats, ya understand me
Few leaves left the sole tree standing
Just as quick as the wind blew they went too
I’m in too deep, my roots go deeper than the spot
Where their bodies shouldn’t sleep
I probably shouldn’t speak like that
But it be like that
Never let a nigga with a knife see my back
I’m outta here
Let me see my hat
And I rock it so low I can’t see where I’m at

[Chorus]
This that boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Fresh just hit me with that (He hit me in my face)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
But can you bless me with that (Bless me in my chest)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Aye, Fresh, just hit me with that
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
(Play me in my head, play me in my head)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Fresh just hit me with that (He hit me in my face)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
But can you bless me with that (Bless me in my chest)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
(Cause I'ma kill 'em with the flow, I'ma kill 'em with the flow)

[Intro]
Weed and syrup, yeah
Who we is? Young Mooolah, baby!
Got that right shorty
Bigg D on the track!

[Hook]
I'm just, staring at the world
From a Cadillac window, baby
Hoping this girl in my passenger don't act funny with me
Get her to my home, we get naked like some new born babies
I'm ready to perform and she's gon' be my audience
And she said "Bravo"
And I said "I know"
And she said "Encore"
Girl, I'm really big on you
So what you wanna do?
Too fly you need a parachute
But that just means you're falling in love

[Verse 1]
In love with a skater
Five six seven, man, I already ate her
She had a coffee mug and a pair of Uggs
Got some makeup on my shirt when she gave me a hug
Shorty got me open
Pussy so good wish I could smoke it
Where your mans at?
Remember me like this one time at band camp, yeah!
Like that man, she on my mind all day, check my CAT scan
Hey, where you going with all that?
I fuck her till she whine and then I drink a tall glass

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Girl you gon' make me take you
To your desired destination
Left leg, right leg, segregation
Cause I know you like that shit, cause I love that shit
Girl that's my hole, I dug that ditch
And when it gets cold, I'm there for her to hold
She climbs my pole, beat that pussy like she stole something
And she so fine
From the front from the side from behind
Pop that pussy like a cork and I'mma fuck you till you whine

[Hook]

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Young niggas gettin' money
And we don't owe you niggas shit
I'm from Philly nigga
We come from the bottom
Come from nothin'
And niggas got the nerve to ask me why I'm stuntin'?
Huh?

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I'da sip Ciroc with Diddy, drunk Spade with Hov
In the VIP of the 40, with some bad-ass hoes
Had my grip on my forty, still was at that stove
The same night work got cooked half that sold
A pyrex and a triple beam
Like Mr. King had a dream we ain't miss a fiend
Talking dirty to these niggas with my Listerine
If I was there you know we ball, Mr. Clean
I'm talking LIV Sunday blowing hella racks
Just getting right cause in my life I been from hell and back
I'm just that nice and I don't write so you can tell 'em that
I'm just making up for nights when I was selling crack
On the corner in the cold tryna sling them O's
And half my niggas in the city went against the code
Them niggas told, still partying them niggas bold
But I'm like fuck it I'm young and getting it them niggas old
Take a walk up to that mirror boy look at yourself
You see a getta or a nigga just lookin' for help
And every night I'm in the studio killing myself
A lot of niggas hate me now cause I'm feeling myself
Fuck em' though
They screaming be humble, boy be humble
But ain't nobody say that when my stomach used to rumble
Looked in a cell when I seen my dreams crumble
Now I'm out here buzzing you can here the bee's bumble

[Pre-Chorus: Guordan Banks]
Seen some things that can't be told
I was told these roads was pure as gold
I never told I never sold my soul
I just went at every thing I dove

[Chorus: Guordan Banks]
Nobody's going back to da bottom
Nobody's going to da bottom
I can't be every nigga role model
I can't go back to the bottom

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Niggas getting high, just to take the pain away
When I'm just getting by couple million for a rainy day
Off season but I practice like I got a game today
And everybody ain't gon' make it out it's a shame to say
Feeling like Mike before the fade away
I'm like should I take the shot? or let it fade away?
And all this love I'm getting ain't gon' take the hate away
But these haters motivate me in a crazy way
Ain't no I in team - from what I done seen
It's every man for himself well, until I intervene
I put my niggas on paper, we swarm paper like lions when they smell blood
When dream shatters they sell love like cocaine
Or heroin from heroin I'm Cobain
I'm blowing up I did my own thing
They want my soul and my body for a little change
I'm dancing with the Illuminati, call it Soul Train
Nigga

[Pre-Chorus:  Guordan Banks]
Seen some things that can't be told
I was told these roads was pure as gold
I never told I never sold my soul
I just went at everything I dove

[Chorus: Guordan Banks]
Nobody's going back to da bottom
Nobody's going to da bottom
I can't be every nigga role model
I can't go back to the bottom

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Last night I forgot to pray for shit that I got today
The devil 'round the corner and the reaper a block away
It's body after body very few of us find a way
You gotta watch for the hook like you sticking Dr. J
My defensive is like three fences and a brick wall
I get soft every time we go against ya'll
I'm on guard play the point like I'm Chris Paul
You get crossed like AI did Mike for this ball
For this rock, you get shot, picked off
Cause in this game we shooting metal like it's pin ball
I put this Mac to your face like lip gloss
And do you right and put you on ice like Lindros
Nigga

[Chorus: Guordan Banks]
Nobody's going back to da bottom
Nobody's going to da bottom
I can't be every nigga role model
I can't go back to the bottom

[Outro: Meek Mill]
I started with a dollar and a dream
And I'm willing to go and get it by any means
I can't be every nigga role model
Why nobody my role model
I got my own son to raise
And my life is very precious
And my son expect me to walk through that door every night
So any nigga try and stop my shine gotta get it
All my niggas out to get it
And we ain't never going back to the bottom
None of my niggas
I hear everybody talking
He spending too much money be humble
Man fuck all that
Who was talking when I was dead broke starving huh?
Ay Gutta, what these niggas talking huh?
It's D.C. double M, G
We been jumped out the barrel on your crab ass niggas
You heard me?
Meek Milly, real nigga for life!

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Finished with my woman
'Cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane
Because I am frowning all the time

[Verse 2]
All day long I think of things
But nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind
If I don't find something to pacify

[Bridge]
Can you help me
Occupy my brain?
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
I need someone to show me
The things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Make a joke and I will sigh
And you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness, I cannot feel
And love to me is so unreal

[Verse 5]
And so, as you hear these words
Telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life
I wish I could but it's too late

[Hook: T-Pain]
Come and get this money (this money)
These Benjamins (Benjamins)
But then again I wanna see what you can do
Let me see you work, work, work, work, work
(What you workin’ with?)
Work, work, work, work, work
(What you workin' with?)
Come and get this money (this money)
These Benjamins (Benjamins)
But then again I wanna see what you can do
Let me see you work, work, work, work, work
(What you workin' with?)
Ooh baby, don’t stop, drop that, don’t stop
What you workin' with?

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
And baby, I don’t wanna be that guy
That falls in love every time you work in here
‘Cause you’re the reason why
I come here in the first place, even after church
Hell yeah, you know you fine
And you deserve every penny that you get, get, get
Stop wasting time, ‘cause every night, you know where I sit

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
And I could sit up in this bitch all night
As long as I get to see you do those things you do
If I’m in the club, you’re all right
‘Cause you gon’ pay those bills on time
I feel on yours, you feel on mine
And you ain’t gotta work too many days a week
And you don’t know this, but that’s money that you’re savin’ me
You’re the one that I wanna be with
But until then, you know where I sit

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
Shorty be poppin’ that pussy and I go to tippin’ them bills
She fresh on that molly, that body Bugatti, she switchin’ them gears
Workin’ that body, I guess them pilates been workin’ for real
It’s early, I threw over 30, that pussy so pretty
Damn, her ass fat, and I’mma leave with that
I got a hundred stashed in that Louis bag
Up and down on that pole again
It’s about a hundred things that I’d do to that
I said handful of money, I’m sewing it up
Lusting for shorty, I’m fallin’ in love
Think I’m addicted, lil’ mama’s a drug
Twenty more thousand, I need it in ones

[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
Every time I step up in the building just to see you
Yeah, you know a nigga got it and you’d better come and get it
Come here, baby girl, and come and get all this money
Go ‘head, turn around so I can smack you on the ass with it
Look good, smell good, sweeter than a candy
I don’t make it rain, I make it Hurricane Sandy
So much money you could probably feed all of your family
When you’re finished maybe we could get a little nasty
If you think your shorty drop-dead gorgeous
Better know my shorty drop-bread gorgeous
Small waist, ass bigger than a walrus
Nails did, skin beautifully flawless
Sittin’ on a pile of money like a fortress
She get a lot of offers, ‘til that shit is funny
When they see a nigga they be really in a hurry
When I come around you can always...

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse]
When can we get together again?
Nevermind
I've lost you

How can I tell if I love you anymore?
Nevermind
I know I do

Call you closer to my arms
You'll feel better when you're warm

You're gonna like it when you leave your house
You're gonna like it when you're in a town
That you love
Like one I live in
Like one I live in
Like one I live in

[Hook]
It's my body's plan

[Bridge]
I feel another
Time out
Of my life
Slow down
I feel another
Time out
Of my life
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down

[Hook]
It's my body's plan

[Outro]
Make another telephone call
And think of you and me
Make another telephone call
Think of you and me
Make another telephone call
Think of you and me
Make another telephone call
Think of you and me
Make another telephone call
Think of you and me
Make another telephone call
Think of you and me
Make another telephone call
Think of you and me
Make another telephone call
Think of you and me

[Intro]
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
(What's wrong with me?)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
(Why do I feel like this?)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
(I'm goin' crazy now)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum

[Verse 1]
No more gas, in the red (Can't even get it started)
Nothin' heard, nothin' said (Can't even speak about it)
All my life on my head (Don't wanna think about it)
Feels like I'm goin' insane, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a thief in the night to come and grab you (Ah)
It can creep up inside you and consume you (Ah)
A disease of the mind, it can control you (Ah)
It's too close for comfort, ah

[Chorus]
Put on your brake lights
You're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter, be wise

[Post-Chorus]
Your mind's in disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia, am I scarin' you tonight?
Your mind's in disturbia, ain't used to what you like
Disturbia, disturbia

Faded pictures on the wall
It's like they talkin' to me
Disconnected, no one calls
The phone don't even ring
I gotta get out or figure this shit out
It's too close for comfort, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a thief in the night to come and grab you (Ooh)
It can creep up inside you and consume you (Ooh)
A disease of the mind, it can control you (Ooh)
I feel like a monster, oh

Put on your brake lights
You're in the city of wonder (City lights)

So if you must falter, be wise (Be wise)

[Intro]
Yeah! Oh, yeah! Now!

[Chorus 1]
Cold ground was my bed last night (bed last night)
And rock was my pillow, too (doo-oo-oo-oo-oo!)
Cold ground was my bed last night (bed last night)
And rock was my pillow, too, Yeah

[Chorus 2]
I'm saying, Talking blues (talking blues)
Talking blues (talking blues)
They say your feet is just too big for your shoes (shoe-oo-oo-oo-oo)
Talking blues (talking blues), talking blues (talking blues)
Your feet is just too big for your shoes (shoe-oo-oo-oo-oo)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I've been down on the rock for so long (so long)
I seem to wear a permanent screw (screw-oo-oo-oo-oo)
I've been down on the rock for so long (so long)
I seem to wear a permanent screw (screw-oo-oo-oo-oo)
But I, I'm going to stare in the sun
Let the rays shine in my eyes
I, I'm a going to take a just-a one step more
Because I feel like bombing a church
Now, now that you know that the preacher is lying
So who's going to stay at home
When, when the freedom fighters are fighting

[Chorus 2]
Talking blues (talking blues)
Talking blues (talking blues)
They say your feet is just too big for your shoes (shoe-oo-oo-oo-oo)
Talking blues (talking blues), keep on talking blues (talking blues)

They say, you hear what they say
Didn't you hear

[Chorus 1]
Cold ground was my bed last night (bed last night)
And rock stone rock stone was my pillow (doo-oo-oo-oo-oo!)
Cold ground was my bed last night (bed last night)
And rock was my pillow, too, Yeah

[Chorus 2]
I'm saying, Talking blues (talking blues)
Talking blues (talking blues)
I seem to wear a permanent screw
Talking blues (talking blues), talking blues (talking blues)
Your feet is just too big for your shoes (shoe-oo-oo-oo-oo)

[Intro]
(Ow, ow-ow-ow-ow!
Ow, ow-ow-ow-ow!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Verse 1]
How can you be sitting there
Telling me that you care
That you care
When every time I look around
The people suffer in the suffering
In every way, in everywhere

[Chorus]
Say, na-na-na-na-na (na-na, na-na!)
We're the survivors

Yes, the Black survivors

[Verse 2]
I tell you what, some people got everything
Some people got nothing
Some people got hopes and dreams
Some people got ways and means

[Chorus]

Like Daniel out of the lions' den
(Black survivors) Survivors, survivors

[Verse 3]
So I Idren, I sistren
Which way will we choose
We better hurry, oh, hurry, oh, hurry, whoa, now
Because we got no time to lose

[Verse 4]
Some people got facts and claims
Some people got pride and shame
Some people got the plots and schemes
Some people got no aim it seems

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Like Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
(Black survivors)
Thrown in the fire, but-a never get burn

So I Idren, I-sistren
The preaching and talking is done
We've gotta live up, wo now, wo now!
Because the Father's time has come
Some people put the best outside
Some people keep the best inside
Some people can't stand up strong
Some people won't wait for long

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
In this age of technological inhumanity (Black survival)
Scientific atrocity (survivors)
Atomic mis-philosophy (Black survival)
Nuclear mis-energy (survivors)
It's a world that forces lifelong insecurity (Black survival)
All together now

[Chorus]

[Outro]
A good man is never honoured (survivors)
In his own country (Black survival)
Nothing change, nothing strange (survivors)
Nothing change, nothing strange (Black survivors)
We got to survive, you all! (survivors)

[Intro]
One, two
One, two, three, four
One, two

[Verse 1]
Measuring a summer's day
I only find it slips away to grey
The hours, they bring me pain

[Chorus]
Tangerine, tangerine
Living reflection from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen
And now a thousand years in between

[Verse 2]
Thinking how it used to be
Does she still remember times like these?
To think of us again
And I do

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Tangerine, tangerine
Living reflection from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen
And now a thousand years in between

[Verse 1]
I don't know how I'm going to tell you
I can't play with you no more
I don't know how I'm gonna do what mama told me
My friend, the boy next door
I can't believe what people saying
You're gonna let your hair hang down
I'm satisfied to sit here working all day long
You're in the darker side of town

[Bridge]
And when I'm out I see you walking
Why don't your eyes see me?
Could it be you've found another game to play?
What did mama say to me?

[Chorus]
That's the way
Oh, that's the way it ought to be
Yeah, yeah, mama say
That's the way it ought to stay
Yeah, yeah, ooooo oooo

[Verse 2]
And yesterday I saw you standing by the river
And weren't those tears that filled your eyes?
And all the fish that lay in dirty water dying
Had they got you hypnotized?
And yesterday I saw you kissing tiny flowers
But all that lives is born to die
And so I say to you that nothing really matters
And all you do is stand and cry

[Bridge]
I don't know what to say about it
When all you ears have turned away
But now's the time to look and look again at what you see
Is that the way it ought to stay?

[Chorus]
That's the way
That's the way it ought-ta be
Oh, don't you know now, mama said, mama said
That's the way it's going to stay, yeah
Ahh, ahh, ahhhh

Ahhhhhh

[Verse 1]
Ah, caught you smiling at me
That's the way it should be
Like a leaf is to a tree, so fine
Ah, all the good times we had
I sang love songs so glad
Always smiling, never sad, so fine

[Chorus]
As we walk down the country lane
I'll be singing a song, hear me calling your name
Hear the wind within the trees
Telling Mother Nature 'bout you and me

[Verse 2]
Well, if the sun shines so bright
Or on our way it's darkest night
The road we choose is always right, so fine
Ah, can your love be so strong
When so many loves go wrong?
Will our love go on and on and on and on and on and on?

[Chorus]
As we walk down the country lanes
I'll be singing a song, hear me calling your name
Hear the wind within the trees
Telling Mother Nature 'bout you and me

[Bridge]
My, my
La la la
Come on now, it ain't too far
Tell your friends all around the world
Ain't no companion like a blue eyed Merle
Come on now, well, let me tell you
What you're missing, messin' 'round them brick walls

[Verse 3]
So of one thing I am sure
It's a friendship so pure
Angels singing all around my door, so fine
Yeah, ain't but one thing to do
Spend my natural life with you
You're the finest dog I knew, so fine

[Outro]
When you're old and your eyes are dim
There ain't no old Shep gonna happen again
We'll still go walking down country lane
I'll sing the same old song, hear me call your name

[Verse 1]
I'll play your fav'rite song, darlin'
We can rock it all night long, darlin'
Cause I've got love, darlin'
Love, sweet love, darlin'

[Verse 2]
Mellow mood has got me
So let the music rock me
Cause I've got love, darlin'
Love, sweet love, darlin'
Quiet as the night
Please turn off your light
I'll play your fav'rite song, darlin'
We can rock it all night long, darlin'

[Bridge]
Strike the hammer while iron is hot
Strike the hammer while iron is hot
Strike the hammer while iron is hot
Open up your heart
Open up your heart
Let love come running in, darlin'
Love, sweet love, darlin'
Love, sweet love, darlin'

[Verse 3]
I'll play your fav'rite song, darlin'
We can rock it all night long, darlin'
Cause I've got love, darlin'
Love, sweet love, darlin'

[Verse 4]
Mellow mood has got me, darlin'
Let the music rock me, darlin'
Cause I got your love, darlin'
Love, sweet love, darlin'

Love, sweet love, darlin'

[Hook]
Ooh, I've done been mistreated, babe, I believe I'll shake 'em on down

[Outro]
Gave my baby a twenty-dollar bill
If that don't get her, I'm sure my shot, shot, shot-gun will
Yeah, I gave my baby a twenty-dollar bill
Well, if that don't get that woman, I'm sure my shot-gun will
I'm gonna go shoot her now

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time since I rock and rolled
It's been a long time since I did the Stroll
Ooh, let me get it back, let me get it back
Let me get it back, baby, where I come from

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

Yes, it has

[Verse 2]
It's been a long time since The Book of Love
I can't count the tears of a life with no love
Carry me back, carry me back
Carry me back, baby, where I come from
Whoa, whoa, oh

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

[Instrumental Break]
Ahhh!  Ahhh!

[Verse 3]
Oh! Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight
Making vows that just can't work right
Oh yeah, open your arms, open your arms
Open your arms, baby, let my love come running in!
Yeah!

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

[Verse 1]
The Queen of Light took her bow
And then she turned to go
The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom
And walked the night alone
Oh, dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The dark Lord rides in force tonight
And time will tell us all
Oh, throw down your plow and hoe
Rest not to lock your homes
Side by side we wait the might of the darkest of them all
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
I hear the horses' thunder down in the valley below
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon
Waiting for the eastern glow

[Verse 2]
The apples of the valley hold the seeds of happiness
The ground is rich from tender care
Repay, do not forget, no, no
Dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The apples turn to brown and black
The tyrant's face is red
Oh, war is the common cry
Pick up your swords and fly
The sky is filled with good and bad
Mortals never know, oh

[Chorus]
Oh, well, the night is long, the beads of time pass slow
Tired eyes on the sunrise
Waiting for the eastern glow

[Verse 3]
The pain of war cannot exceed
The woe of aftermath
The drums will shake the castle wall
The ring wraiths ride in black, ride on
Sing as you raise your bow (Ride on)
Shoot straighter than before
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold
Oh, dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The magic runes are writ in gold
To bring the balance back
Bring it back

[Outro]
At last the sun is shining
The clouds of blue roll by
With flames from the dragon of darkness
The sunlight blinds his eyes!
Ahhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhh
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Oh now, oh now, oh now, oh
Oh now, oh now, oh now
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Ooh now, oh now, oh now, oh
Oh now, oh now, oh now
Bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it
Bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it
Bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it

[Verse 1]
Oh, baby, it's crying time
Oh, baby, I got to fly
Got to try to find a way
Got to try to get away
'Cause you know I gotta get away from you, babe

[Verse 2]
Oh, baby, the river's red
Ah, baby, in my head
There's a funny feeling going on
I don't think I can hold out long

[Chorus]
And when the owls cry in the night
Oh, baby, baby, when the pines begin to cry
Baby, baby, baby, how do you feel?
If the rivers run dry, baby, how would you feel?

[Verse 3]
Craze, baby, the rainbow's end
Mm, baby, it's just a den for those who hide
Who hide their love to depths of life
And ruin dreams that we all knew so, babe

[Chorus]
And when the owls cry in the night
And, baby, when the pines begin to cry
Oh, baby, baby, how do you feel?
If the rivers run dry, baby, how do you feel?
Ah, ah...
Baby, how do you feel?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Ooh yeah, brave I endure
Ooh yeah, strong shields and lore
They can't hold the wrath of those who walk
And the boots of those who march
Baby, through the roads of time so long ago

[Outro]
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh yeah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, hoo
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ah

[Verse 1]
Spent my days with a woman unkind
Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going to California with an aching in my heart
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair

[Verse 2]
Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let 'em tell you that they're all the same
Oh, the sea was red, and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
The children of the sun began to awake (watch out)

[Verse 3]
Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose, and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line, if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path runs straight and high

[Verse 4]
To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings... La la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems, mm...

[Outro]
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I had a dream, oh yeah
Crazy dream, oh ho
Anything I wanted to know
Any place I needed to go
Hear my song, yeah
People, don't you listen now?
Sing along, oh
You don't know what you're missing now
Any little song that you know
Everything that's small has to grow
And it's gonna grow now, push, push, yeah

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Verse 2]
Na-na-na-na-na
California sunlight
Sweet Calcutta rain
Honolulu starbright
The song remains the same, ooo, ooo, ooh
(Get it on)

[Guitar Solo 2]
Oh
Keep on

[Outro]
All you gotta do, all you gotta do
All you gotta do now, all you gotta do now
Ooh, sing out Hare Hare
Ooh, dance the Hoochie Koo
City lights are oh-so bright
As we go sliding, sliding
Sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding....

[Verse 1]
It is the springtime of my loving
The second season I am to know
You are the sunlight in my growing
So little warmth I've felt before
It isn't hard to feel me glowing
I watched the fire that grew so low, oooh, oh

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
It is the summer of my smiles
Flee from me, keepers of the gloom
Speak to me only with your eyes
It is to you I give this tune
Ain't so hard to recognize, oh
These things are clear to all from time to time, ooh
Oh, oh

[Verse 3]
Ah, talk, talk, talk, talk
Hey!
I've felt the coldness of my winter
I never thought it would ever go
I cursed the gloom that set upon us, upon us, upon us
But I know that I love you so, ohhhh, oh
But I know that I love you so
These are the seasons of emotion
And like the winds they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion
I see the torch we all must hold
This is the mystery of the quotient, quotient
Ah, upon us all, upon us all a little rain must fall
Just a little rain, oh yeah
Uhh, ooooh, yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you about my good thing
I ain't disclosing no names, but
He sure is a good friend, and
I ain't gonna tell you where he comes from, boy
If I tell you, you won't come again, hey
I ain't gonna tell you nothing, but I do will, but I know, yeah!
Now let me tell you about my girl
I open up a newspaper, and what do I see?

[Chorus]
Ah, ah
See my girl, ah, looking at me

[Verse 2]
Ooh, and when she walks, she walks
Let me tell you, when she talks, she talks
And when she looks me in my eye
She's my baby, Lord, I wanna make her mine
Ooh, tell me, baby, what you want me to do
And you want me to love you, love some other men?
Ooh, ain't gonna call me Mr. Pitiful, no!
Ah, I don't need no respect from nobody, no, no

[Chorus]
Ah yeah, no, no
Ah

[Verse 3]
I ain't gonna tell you nothing, I ain't gonna tell you no more, no!
She's my baby, let me tell you that I love her so and, and!
She is the woman I really wanna love, and let me tell you more
Ooh! She's my baby, let me tell you, she lives next door
She's the one a woman the one a woman that I know
I ain't going, I ain't going, I ain't going to tell
I ain't going to tell you one thing
That you really ought to know, boy!
She's my lover, baby, and I love her so, and
She's the one that really makes me whirl and twirl, and!
She's the kind of lover that makes me feel the whole world, and
She's the one who really makes me jump and shout, oh!
She's the kind of girl, I know what it's all about!
Take it on
Take it, take it, take it

[Bridge]
Ah, excuse me
Oh, will you excuse me?
I'm just trying to find the bridge!
Has anybody seen the bridge?
Please!
(Have you seen the bridge?)
I ain't seen the bridge!
(Where's that confounded bridge?)

[Verse 1]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You don't have to go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You don't have to go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You don't have to go
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
All those tears I cry, ay, ay, ay, ay
All those tears I cry, oh, oh, oh, ay
Baby, please don't go

[Chorus]
When I read the letter you wrote me, it made me mad, mad, mad
When I read the words that it told me, it made me sad, sad, sad
But I still love you so, I can't let you go
I love you, ooh, baby, I love you

[Verse 2]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Every breath I take oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, every move I make
Oh, baby, please don't go, oh
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
You hurt me to my soul, oh, oh, oh, oh
You hurt me to my soul, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Darling, please don't go

[Chorus]
When I read the letter you sent me, it made me mad, mad, mad
When I read the news that it broke, it made me sad, sad, sad
But I still love you so, and I can't let you go

Oh baby, baby

[Verse 1]
Close the door, put out the light
You know they won't be home tonight, oh oh
The snow falls hard, and don't you know?
The winds of Thor are blowing cold
They're wearing steel that's bright and true
They carry news that must get through

[Chorus]
They choose the path where no-one goes
They hold no quarter
They hold no quarter
Aaaah!

[Instrumental]

[Guitar and piano solo]

[Verse 2]
Walking side by side with death
The devil mocks their every step, ooh
The snow drives back the foot that's slow
The dogs of doom are howling more, oh
They carry news that must get through
To build a dream for me and you, oh

[Chorus]
They choose the path where no-one goes
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
Oh!
The pain, the pain without quarter, oh yeah!
They ask no quarter (without quarter, quarter, quarter)
They give no quarter (giving me, giving me no...)
Oh (I hear the dogs of doom are howling more!)

[Intro: John Bonham]
"We've done four already but now we're steady
And then they went: One, two, three, four"

[Verse 1]
Singing in the sunshine, laughing in the rain
Hitting on the moonshine, rocking in the grain
Got no time to pack my bags, my foots outside the door
I got a date, I can't be late, for the high hopes hailla ball
Oh ho
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar (ooh)
Play for free, play for me and play a whole lot more, more! (ooh)
Singing about good things and the sun that lights the day (ooh)

Sitting round singing songs until the night turns into day (ooh)
Used to sing on the mountains, but the mountains washed away
(Ooh)
Now I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart
She is only three years old and it's a real fine way to start

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
It sure is fine
I blow my mind
When the tears are going down
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Oh, so good!

[Verse 1]
Ooh

Shake it, shake it

When you cut it, mama, mama, please save me a slice

I chew on a piece of your custard pie

[Verse 1]
In my time of dying
I want nobody to mourn
All I want for you to do
Is take my body home

[Chorus]
Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Jesus got to make up
You know
Jesus going to make up
Jesus going to make up my dying bed

[Verse 2]
Meet me, Jesus, meet me
Ooh, meet me in the middle of the air
If my wings should fail me, Lord
Oh, please meet me with another pair

[Chorus]
Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Oh, oh
Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Jesus going to make up
Somebody, somebody
Oh, oh
Jesus going to make up
Jesus going to make up my dying bed

[Verse 3]
Oh, Saint Peter
At the gates of heaven
Won't you let me in?
I never did no harm
I never did no wrong
Ah, oh, Gabriel, let me blow your horn
Let me blow your horn
Oh, I never did no harm
Did no harm
I've only been this young once
I never thought I'd do anybody no wrong
No, not once, oh no

[Bridge]
Oh yeah!

[Verse 4]
Oh, I did somebody some good
Somebody some good, yes, oh
Oh, did somebody some good, yeah
I must have did somebody some good, yeah
Oh, I believe I did
I see the smiling faces
I know I must have left some traces, oh

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 5]
And I see them in the streets
And I see them in the field
And I hear them shouting under my feet
And I know it's got to be real
Oh Lord, deliver me
All the wrong I've done
Oh, you can deliver me, Lord
I only wanted to have some fun
Oh, hear the angels marching, hear them marching
Hear them marching, hear them marching, the marching

[Verse 6]
Oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus
Oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus
My Jesus, oh my Jesus
Oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus, ah, oh
Now my Jesus, hey, yeah, it's got to be my Jesus, oh-whoa
It's got to be, it's got to be my Jesus, it's got to be, oh
It's got to be my Jesus, oh, take me home
Come on, come on, I can hear the angels singing
Oh, here they come, here they come, here they come
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye
Oh, it feels pretty good up here, pretty good up here
Oh Georgina, oh Georgina, oh Georgina, oh Georgina, oh Georgina
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Ooh, I'll see you again, come on
Take it, take it, take it, take, it, yeah, yeah, hey, hey, ooh yes
Oh, don't you make it my dying, dying, dying...

[Outro]
(Coughing)
Cough
That's going to be the one isn't it?
Come have a listen then
Oh yes, thank you

[Verse 1]
I've been to London, seen seven wonders
I know to trip is just to fall
I used to rock it, sometimes I'd roll it
I always knew what it was for

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There can be no denying
That the wind'll shake 'em down
And the flat world's flying
There's a new plague on the land

[Chorus]
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands

[Verse 2]
Traversed the planet, when heaven sent me
I saw the kings who rule them all
Still by the firelight and purple moonlight
I hear the rested rivers call

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And the wind is crying
From a love that won't grow cold
My lover, she is lying
On the dark side of the globe

[Chorus]
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
You got me rocking when I ought to be a-rolling
Darling, tell me, darling, which way to go
You keep me rocking, baby, then you keep me stalling
Won't you tell me, darling, which way to go, that's right

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Oh how I wonder, oh how I worry
And I would dearly like to know
Of all this wonder, of earthly plunder
Will it leave us anything to show?

[Pre-Chorus 3]
And our time is flying
See the candle burning low
Is the new world rising
From the shambles of the old?

[Chorus]
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just, if we could just, if we could just
If we could just, if we could just join hands
That's all it takes, that's all it takes
That's all it takes, that's all it takes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh yeah
Ah, ah, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
And if you feel that you can't go on
And your will's sinking low
Just believe, and you can't go wrong
In the light, you will find the road
You will find the road

[Verse 2]
Hey, ooh, did you ever believe that I could leave you
Standing out in the cold?
Yeah, baby, I know how it feels 'cause I have slipped through
To the very depths of my soul, yeah
Oh-ho, baby, I just want to show you what a clear view
It is from every bend in the road
Now listen to me
Oh, whoa-whoa, as I was
And really would be for you, too, honey
As you would for me, oh, I would share your load
Let me share your load
Ooh, let me share, share your load

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
And if you feel that you can't go on
In the light, you will find the road
Hey, oh ho, the the winds of change may blow around you
But that will always be so
Whoa whoa, when love is pain it can devour you, but you are never alone
I will share your load, I will share your load
Baby, let me, oh, let me

[Bridge]
In the light
Everybody needs the light
Ooh, yeah yeah
Ooh, baby
In the light, in the light, in the light

[Outro]
Light, light, light, in the light
Light, light, light, in the light, ooh, yeah
Light, light, light, in the light
Light, light, light, in the light
Light, light, light, in the light, ooh yeah yeah
Light, light, light, in the light, everybody, come on now

[Verse 1]
Down by the seaside
See the boats go sailing
Can the people hear
Oh, what the little fish are saying?

[Refrain]
Oh oooh
The people turned away, oh
The people turned away

[Verse 2]
Down in the city streets
See all the folk go racing, racing
No time left, oh no
To pass the time of day

[Refrain]
Hey, hey, yeah
The people turned away
The people turned away
So far away, so far away

[Bridge]
See how they run, see how they run
See how they run, see how they run...
Do you still do the twist?
Do you find you remember things that well?
I wanna tell you
Some go twisting every day
Though sometimes it's awful hard to tell
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, ohh

[Verse 3]
Out in the country
Hear the people singing
Singing about their growin'
Knowing where they're goin'
Yeah, yeah

[Refrain]
Oh, oh, the people turned away, yeah
Oh, the people turned away

[Verse 4]
Sing loud for the sunshine
Pray hard for the rain
And show your love for Lady Nature
And she will come back again
Yeah, yes, she will

[Refrain]
Oh, the people turned away
The people turned away

[Chorus]
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, overload

[Verse 1]
Steak knife, card shark
Con job, boot cut
Skin that flick, she's such a little DJ
Get there quick by street but not the freeway
Turn that trick to make a little leeway
Beat that nic, but not the way that we play
Dogtown, blood bath
Rib cage, soft tail

[Chorus]
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

[Verse 2]
Black jack, dope dick
Pawn shop, quick pick
Kiss that dyke, I know you want to hold one
Not on strike but I'm about to bowl one
Bite that mic, I know you never stole one
Girls that like a story, so I told one
Song bird, main line
Cash back, hard top

[Chorus]
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, oversold
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

[Bridge]
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah

[Chorus]
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, oversold
By the way, I tried to say
I know you from before

[Outro]
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

[Verse 1]
Can I get your hand to write on?
Just a piece of leg to bite on
What a night to fly my kite on
Do you want to flash a light on?

[Refrain]
Take a look it's on display for you
Comin' down, no, not today

[Verse 2]
Did you meet your fortune teller?
Get it off with no propeller
Do it up, it's on with Stella
What a way to finally smell her

[Refrain]
Pickin' up, but not too strong for you
Take a piece and pass it on

[Chorus]
Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together

[Post-Chorus]
Fly on my wind

[Verse 3]
Rebel and a liberator
Find a way to be a skater
Rev it up to levitate her
Super friendly aviator

[Refrain]
Take a look it's on display, for you
Comin' down, no not today

[Chorus]
Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together

[Post-Chorus]
In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my Zephyr
We'll find a place together

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-woah, do you
Yea-yea-yea-yea-yea-yeah
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-woah, want to
Yea-yea-yea-yea-yea-yeah

[Chorus]
Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together

[Post-Chorus]
In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my Zephyr
We're gonna live forever

[Outro]
Forever

[Intro]
Yeah, ahh
They say money can't buy you love
They say money can't buy you love
They never seem to listen
I'm all ears

[Verse 1]
Just copped your girl a brand new Rolex
But you can never find the time to spend at home
Thinking that's gon' keep her happy
When time is all she wanted all along

[Chorus]
It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talking, but don't hear what she said
Why do you make something so easy so complicated?
Searching for what's right in front of your face
But you can't see it

[Verse 2]
So you think that you know what's important
Steady chasing your fame and your fortune
But you don't know you're chasing a dime, losing a treasure
Those dollars don't make sense to me at all
Ooh, it goes (Duh da, duh da)
You give her spending money (Duh da, duh da)
But all she wanna spend is time alone (Tonight)
Keep giving her (The finer things, but)
But she don't really need that (If you don't stop, you're)
You're gonna end up alone (Alone)
In a world without love (Duh duh da, duh da)
Why would you do it?

[Chorus]
It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talking, but don't hear what she said
Why do you make something so easy so complicated?
Searching for what's right in front of your face
But you can't see it

It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talking, but don't hear what she said
Why do you make something so easy so complicated?
Searching for what's right in front of your face
But you can't see it

[Bridge]
Listen, stop trying to buy her love
'Cause you won't ever have enough
There's always someone with more than you
You need to pay her attention
Give her what she needs
Do the simple things
Before you lose your girl to me

[Break]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeeah
Yeeeah, yeah
Play on, playa
Yeah, your girl coming with me shorty, haha
I'm telling you, man
Cause you know...

[Chorus]
It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talking, but don't hear what she said
Why do you make something so easy so complicated?
Searching for what's right in front of your face
But you can't see it

[Verse 3]
You better look out
I hear you talking, I hear you talking, hah
But what are you saying?
Oh hoo oh hooo
Don't be a fool, you got a good thing
Man, are you blind, stupid or crazy?
You got a good thing, uh
You got a good thing
If that's your lady, you better hold on
And give her what she want before she move on
Man, I tell you, cars, clothes, and fancy things don't mean a damn thing
If you ain't kicking it, baby

[Chorus]
It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talking, but don't hear what she said
Why do you make something so easy so complicated?
Searching for what's right in front of your face
But you can't see it

[Outro]
Don't let this be the thing you'll always regret, no
It's right there, it's right there...

[Verse 1]
I met you when you knew who I was
My speech was different
And I came across just fine
I met you when you knew who I was
My speech was different
But I came across just fine
Am I turning out to be the one who doesn't want to speak?

[Verse 2]
It's 'cause I've been alone
My days in life aren't real
It's 'cause I've been alone
This is how I feel
This is how I feel
This is how I feel

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda with Chester Bennington]
(Ohh...)
Riding with the head full of buckets of red
And what I said still stuck in my head
But misled thinking the things that you would make you never wanna come back
But an on front attack
So you could never run from that
Being trapped in this with you
Something that I never wanted to do
But through it all, you got to see
That where I want to be is over the pen again
Letting it out of me
In the center of the day, in a dream
Seeing all my thoughts
Getting lost in between
Realizing one not the way that it seems
And the killing of the killer with a head full of screams

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I live for them
(Start seeing it's not meant to be for me)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
We're gonna be crushed when it all falls apart
Knowing no matter how low
Hoping that you won't know the strain it puts to me
Seeing what you've done inconsequently
I've run away, just hidden again
Within the boundaries of an anguish
Don't want me to say this
But you're dragging me down
Lost in the chaos, being tossed around
Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic
Hope that someday you'll regret this
Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time
Adding to the panic in my confine
Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic
Hope that someday you'll regret this
Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time
Adding to the panic of my confine

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I live for them
(Start seeing it's not meant to be for me)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away

You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I live for them
(Start seeing it's not meant to be for me)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Interlude: Chester Bennington]
Take
A
Way

[Outro: Mike Shinoda with Chester Bennington]
Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic
Hope that someday you'll regret this
Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time
Adding to the panic in my confine
(Ahhh!)
Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic
Hope that someday you'll regret this
Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time
Adding to the panic in my confine
(Ahhh!)

[Verse 1]
He got flat, baby
Kick in the back, baby
A heart attack, baby
I need your body

A hot kiss, honey
He's just a bitch, baby
You make me sick, baby
So unrelyin'

You just a rival

Always so please, daddy
Right up and leave, daddy
You're throwin' shame, daddy
So undesirable

[Chorus]
Trust in me
Just in me
Put all your trust in me
You're doin' morphine
Go ‘on, babe

[Bridge]
Relax
This won't hurt you
Before I put it in
Close your eyes and count to ten
Don't cry
I won't convert you
There's no need to dismay
Close your eyes and drift away
Demerol
Demerol
Oh God, he's taking Demerol
Demerol
Demerol
Oh God, he's taking Demerol
He's tried
Hard to convince her
To be over what he had
Today he wants it twice as bad
Don't cry
I won't resent you
Yesterday you had his trust
Today he's taking twice as much
Demerol
Demerol
Oh God, he's taking Demerol
Hee-hee

Oh my, he's got his Demerol
Hee-hee
Ooh

Your dog's a bitch, baby
You make me sick, baby
You are a liar

Is truth a game, daddy
To win the fame, baby
It's all the same, baby
You're so reliable

[Chorus]
Trust in me
Just in me
Put all your trust in me
You're doin' morphine
Hoo!

[Verse 4]
You just sit around just talkin' nothin'
You're takin' morphine
Hoo!
Go ‘on, baby
You just sit around just talkin' about it
You're takin' morphine
Hoo-hoo!
Just sit around just talkin' nothin' about it
You're takin' morphine
You know what I mean?
You just sit around just talkin' about it
You're takin' morphine
Hoo-hoo!
You just sit around just talkin' nothing
And takin' morphine
Hoo-hoo-hoo!
I'm goin' down, baby Hoo!
You're talkin' morphine

[Outro]
Go ‘on, baby!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Morphine!
Do it!
Hoo!
He's takin' morphine
Morphine!
Morphine!

[Intro: Paul Wall]
What it do, baby?
It's Paul Wall, come on

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Purple pint, that's Gucci rap
Driving slow, black on black
Backwood lit, windows cracked
Dime in my lap with her hair pulled back
And a hand full of diamonds all on my wrist
Mouth full of ice, pardon my lisp
World full of hate is fear a few rips
So I open my mind and stack up my chips
Lollipop grind, whole lotta licks
From paper planes to a house made of bricks
Big ol' cold cup with codeine mix
So I'm so throwed and I'm still gettin' lit
And everything is purple, baby

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
I said, everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)
I said, everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Trill OG and I rep the South
Nigga, I rep the streets and I rep the hood
And I'm grippin' grain, grippin' stains
And I'm flippin' mane so it's pretty good
I'm holdin' wood with diamonds on it
Hittin' the block and I'm grindin' on it
With a big ol' chain and a big ol' piece
‘Cause when I'm in these streets I be shinin', homie
Haters better get they ass behind me, homie
‘Cause I'm in the front and I'm takin' charge
And when I'm done, I'mma have a homie run
And they be hard to find like they's El Debarge
And my swag is large, extra large
I can barely fit it up in this room
But don't sweat the size and don't be surprised
When your bitch reminds that I'm the shit to swoon
I lick the blunt and I pass the 'dro
Spit my game and I smash your ho
But no, I ain't trick, it's no passin' dough
Then I hop up in this slab and I mash it, bro
I got a passion for this Southern flow
This that purple life and we thuggin', bro
These haters might not really understand it
But that's all good ‘cause we love it though
This PAT, that's where I'm from
That's what I rep and that's how it go
I roll with rocks so get up off the jock
From New York to PA, this that purple flow
It's that swag

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
I said, everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)
I said, everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Purple swag, purple swag, I'm in the zone, I'm getting throwed
That purple swag, purple swag, that purple smoke up in my clothes
That big booty, juicy fruity, yellow bone, I wanna bone
I'm getting dome, I took her out, dick in her mouth, she getting on
I'm flexing steel, I'm flexing still, I'm sitting high, I'm tipping slow
I'm Texas trill, Texas trill, but in NY we spit it slow
I got these boppas going crazy, they see me comin'
Robitussin, quit discussin', A$AP, tell these niggas somethin'

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
I said, everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)
I said, everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)

[Interlude: Killa Kyleon]
Ha-ha-yeah
Check, one, two, what it do?

[Verse 4: Killa Kyleon]
Fo's spinnin' like the shit under my wave cap
Just rock it like a nigga named "A$AP"
Fast money man, I get mine ASAP
Always stacking and I'm paid, that's ASAP
Wood grippin', candy drippin'
Four in my 20, I'm candy sippin'
Fill my prescription, I'm leanin', ho
Nightmare cup, I'm dreamin', ho
Trill nigga like Chad and Bun B
Crocodile seats insides, I'm Dundee
Slow that down, Screw, Watts or Ron C
I'm getting rap money but I used to run D
MC, rep, run it
Frank Castle shit, any beat get punished
Y'all got problems, I get money
So my neck, fist, wrist always look sunny
I stay fresh, y'all niggas look bummy
Cold with the flow, so I ball like Tommy
Martin, I keep a yellow bone like Gina
Thick like Serena, my pockets on Venus, nigga!

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
(Swag) Everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)

Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)

[Hook]
It hurts so good inside

[Refrain]
I don't want to know more about him and how he was in your shadow
Don't tell me anymore about what you have
I know you're different now from what I had

[Hook]
It hurts so good inside

[Bridge]
I'm sorry I couldn't name the color of your eyes
I'm sorry I couldn't name the color of your eyes
I'm sorry I couldn't name the color of your eyes

[Refrain]
I don't want to know more about him and how he was in your shadow
Don't tell me anymore about what you have
I know you're different now from what I had

[Verse]
Turn those fans away from me
They only dry my eyes out
Ever since I was born I couldn't see
Ever since I could see I couldn't find
Why you close your lips so tight
When I try to kiss you off goodbye
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
I never wanted to be never understanding
Blurry comprehension
Leaving everyone
Wondering where he went

Doesn't matter does it?
Doesn't matter does it?
Doesn't matter does it?
Doesn't matter does it?
Doesn't matter does it?
Doesn't matter does it?
Doesn't matter does it?
Doesn't matter does it?
Doesn't matter does it?
Doesn't matter does it?
Doesn't matter does it?

Ah, ahh, oohh...

Went gold in a month so it ain't no budget
New chains, rolex links
New chick just to drag my mink

Hating on hood niggas dying 'round here
Bath Salt Boss, got insurance on the beard
Cars rockstars, dope boys at odds

Hands clap like a nigga in the stadium
Million dollar chain but I'm rocking 8 of 'em
I see you slipping boy don't make me pick your label up
Scottie Pippen on the dribble I just laid 'em up

[Verse 1: Usher]
I can't win, I can't reign
I will never win this game
Without you, without you
I am lost, I am vain
I will never be the same
Without you, without you

[Pre-Chorus 1: Usher]
I won't run, I won't fly
I will never make it by
Without you, without you
I can't rest, I can't fight
All I need is you and I
Without you, without you

[Chorus: Usher]
Oh-oh-oh
You, you, you
Without...
You, you, you
Without... you

[Verse 2: Usher]
Can't erase, so I'll take blame
But I can't accept that we're estranged
Without you, without you
I can't quit now, this can't be right
I can't take one more sleepless night
Without you, without you

[Pre-Chorus 2: Usher]
I won't soar, I won't climb
If you're not here, I'm paralyzed
Without you, without you
I can't look, I'm so blind
I lost my heart, I lost my mind
Without you, without you

[Chorus: Usher]
Oh-oh-oh
You, you, you
Without...
You, you, you
Without... you

[Outro: Usher]
I am lost, I am vain
I will never be the same
Without you, without you
Without you

[Verse 1]
I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
You'll only see my reflection
It's always best with the covers up
I am the pick in the ice
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
You know we're friends 'til we die

[Chorus]
And either way you turn
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls

[Verse 2]
It's always best when the light is off
It's always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
Fifteen blows to your mind
So lock the kids up safe tonight
Shut the eyes in the cupboard
I've got the smell of a local man
Who's got the loneliest feeling

[Chorus]
That either way he turns
I will be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
*scream*

[Verse 1: John Martin]
Into the streets
We're coming down
We never sleep
Never get tired
Through urban fields
And suburban lights

[Pre-Chorus: John Martin]
Turn the crowd up now
We'll never back down
Shoot down the skyline
Watch it on primetime
Turn up the love now
Listen up now, turn up the love

[Chorus: John Martin]
Who's gonna save the world tonight?
Who's gonna bring it back to life?
We're gonna make it, you and I
We're gonna save the world tonight

[Verse 2: John Martin]
We're far from home
It's for the better
What we dream, it's all that matters
We're on our way, united

[Pre-Chorus: John Martin]
Turn the crowd up now
We'll never back down
Shoot down the skyline
Watch it on primetime
Turn up the love now
Listen up now, turn up the love

[Chorus: John Martin]
Who's gonna save the world tonight?
Who's gonna bring it back to life?
We're gonna make it, you and I
We're gonna save the world tonight

[Outro: John Martin]
Who's gonna save...?
Who's gonna bring...?
We're gonna make it, you and I
Who's gonna save...?
Who's gonna bring...?
We're gonna save the world tonight

When It's Her That I'd Rather Be Doing

(Hook 1-Lil Wayne)

(Hook 3-Lil Wayne)
I say I’m Coming Back
And When I Get Back
I Told Her I'mma Eat It Like I’m Eating This Track
And She Came Down To The Studio When She Heard That
She Walked In To The Vocal Booth And Laid On Her Back
I Ain’t Even Start The Song
I Put My Face Where It Belong
And Then I Let Her Sing On My Private Microphone
It Went Down In The Studio Making This Track
Now Every Time She Hears It
It Make Her Think Back
Think Back To The Day
To The Day She Came To The Studio And Now
All She Ever Wanna Know Is If I’m Down In The Studio

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Reminiscing, I remember me and you we used to play with the dogs
While you were sleep I'd stare, stare while you lay in my arms
And now I'm stuck on stupid, rain forest couldn't get wetter than you get
I used to beat it up, you gave me your love, I abused it, now I'm facing the music

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, how I yearn for your touch
I'm so lonely now that you left me
If I could run away, you know I would
And I'm hurting 'cause girl, I never loved you like I should

[Chorus]
When your love is lost
Your whole worlds thrown off
When the one you need don't need you
What do you do, when love is lost?

[Verse 2]
I was tripping, wouldn't listenm now I'm sitting, sipping shots at the bar
Now I'm riding to the 90's hits, listening to Aerosmith
"I don't wanna close my eyes, don't wanna fall asleep "
Tell me how I can I be fly without the wind beneath my wings? Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, how I yearn for your touch
I'm so lonely now that you left me
If I could run away, you know I would
And I'm hurting 'cause girl, I never loved you like I should

[Chorus]
When your love is lost
Your whole worlds thrown off
When the one you need don't need you
What do you do, when love is lost?

[Bridge]
And now I see the man you need
When I look into the mirror I see change
And I close my eyes and wish you could see the same
But it's too late

[Chorus]
When your love is lost
Your whole worlds thrown off
When the one you need don't need you
What do you do
When your love is lost
Your whole worlds thrown off
When the one you need don't need you
What do you do, when love is lost?

[Outro]
Gone out the window
When your love is lost
Can't see your love no more
When the one you need don't need you
What do you do, when love is lost?

[Intro]
Ayy, Em
Yeah!

[Chorus]
So, Slim Shady, to the stage, please
Oh, won't you please make the place go crazy?
You know what you doin' when you do it for the ladies
So, ladies, this ain't the place to be in if you're lazy (Get up!)
I said, "Shady, to the stage please"
Oh, won't you please make the place go crazy?
You know what you doin' when you do it for the ladies
So won't you please step up to the mic, baby?

[Verse 1]
It's been a little boring lately
I've been playing in poison ivy and pee
I've been itching to get in some S-H-I-T
You heard what I S-A-I-D
This club? I guess they I.D.​
But they just let me in without it, so I guess they like me
I put on my best dang white tee for this evening's festivities
And I even got it pressed and dry-cleaned
It's me and the rest of my heathens, we in the building
'Til it closes, we're partying 'til then nobody knows that I'm drinking
Keep my Bacardi concealed inside of my jacket
When no one's looking, I tap the bottle, crack it, then swig it then put the frigging top back on it and cap it
Yeah, that same bullshit, man, I just got back on it, god dammit
Boy, you don't want it, doggone it, that gin and tonic, I slam it
An alcoholic, I am what I am, that's all that I am
And upon my further inspection, Monica's bra I examine
And if you're wondering why I'm looking in awe as I am
It's 'cause I'm just so overjoyed to see people brawl to my
