 the season, must be the season (Witch) (You've got to pick up every stitch)
Said it must be the season, must be the season, must be the season (Witch) (You've got to pick up every stitch)
Said it must be the season, must be the season, must be the season (Witch)
(Must be the season of the witch)
Witch (Must be the season of the witch)

[Outro]
Witch, witch
Witch, witch
Witch, witch
Witch, witch

[Intro: Brian]
Baby, oh-oh

[Verse 1: Brian]
Even  in my heart, I see
You're  not being true to me
Deep within my soul, I feel
Nothing's like it used to be

[Pre-Chorus: Brian]
Sometimes  I wish I could turn back time
Impossible  as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

[Chorus: Brian & All]
Quit  playing games with my heart
Quit playing games with my heart (my heart)
Before you tear us apart (my heart)
Quit playing games with my heart
I  should've known from the start
You know you've got to stop (from my heart)
You're tearing us apart (my heart)
Quit playing games with my heart

[Verse 2: Brian]
I live my life the way
To keep you coming back to me
Everything I do is for you
So what is it that you can't see

[Pre-Chorus: Brian]
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby
You better

[Chorus: Brian & All]
Quit playing games with my heart
Quit playing games with my heart (my heart)
Before you tear us apart (my heart)
Quit playing games with my heart
I should've known from the start
You know you've got to stop (from my heart)
You're tearing us apart (my heart)
Quit playing games

[Bridge: AJ with Kevin]
Baby, baby!
The love that we had was so strong
Don't leave me hanging here forever
Oh baby, baby, this is not right
Let's stop this tonight

[Interlude: Brian & All]
Baby, oh-oh
Quit playing games
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, baby
Na na na na na na

[Pre-Chorus: Brian]
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

[Chorus: Brian & All]
Quit playing games with my heart
Quit playing games with my heart (my heart)
Before you tear us apart (my heart)
Quit playing games with my heart
I should've known from the start
You know you've got to stop (from my heart)
You're tearing us apart (my heart)
Quit playing games with my heart

[Outro: Brian & All]
Quit playing games with my heart
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na, baby
Na na na na na na na
Quit playing games with my heart
Na na na na na na na
From my heart
Na na na na na, baby
With my heart, my heart

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time since I rock and rolled
It's been a long time since I did the Stroll
Ooh, let me get it back, let me get it back
Let me get it back, baby, where I come from

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Yes, it has

[Verse 2]
It's been a long time since The Book of Love
I can't count the tears of a life with no love
Carry me back, carry me back
Carry me back, baby, where I come from

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

[Verse 3]
Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight
Making vows that just can't work right
Open your arms, opens your arms
Open your arms, baby, let my love come running in

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

[Verse 1]
Bright light almost blinding
Black  night still there shining
I  can't stop, keep on climbing
Looking for what I knew
Had a friend, she once told me
You  got love, you ain't lonely
Now  she's gone and left me only
Looking for what I knew

[Chorus]
Mmm,  I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy just

[Verse 2]
Met  a man on the roadside crying
Without a friend, there's no denying
You're incomplete, they'll be no finding
Looking for what you knew
So anytime somebody needs you
Don't let them down, although it grieves you
Some day you'll need someone like they do
Looking for what you knew

[Chorus]
Mmm, I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy just
I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy, It's very easy
It's very easy, It's easy, easy, yeah

[Chorus]
Let me take you to the movie
Can I take you to the show?
Let me be yours ever truly
Can I make your garden grow?

[Verse 1]
From the houses of the holy
We can watch the white doves go
From the door comes Satan's daughter
And it only goes to show

[Hook]
You know

[Verse 2]
There's an angel on my shoulder
In my hand a sword of gold
Let me wander in your garden
And the seeds of love I'll sow

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So the world is spinning faster
Are you dizzy when you're stoned?
Let the music be your master
Will you heed the master's call?
Oh, Satan

[Verse 4]
Said there ain't no use in crying
Cause it will only, only drive you mad
Does it hurt to hear them lying?
Was this the only world you had? Oh, oh

[Chorus]
So let me take you, take you to the movie
Can I take you, baby, to the show?
Why don't you let me be yours ever truly
Can I make your garden grow?

[Hook]
And you know, that’s right

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Know you got your own shit, and all of it together
And  you know you got your own space right here forever, baby
You  know you got your own, know you got your own
Know you got your own, know you, know you got your own
Know you got your own shit, and all of it together (My own session)
And  you know you got your own space right here forever, baby (And my own blessing)
Know  you got your own, know you got your own
Know you got your own, know you, know you got your own

And you know you got your own space right here forever, babe (And my own blessing)
Know you got your own, know you got your own
I know you got your own, I know you got your own

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Ayy,  stay sound when you not around
Mood is always better whenever you not around
Fuckin' up the weather and you fuckin' up my town
Fuckin' up a sweater and I'm fuckin' up a gown
Look at how I'm shinin' though
Look at how I'm smilin' though
Look at how I'm smilin'
Look at how I'm wildin', and I'm still broke, uh
You still think I'm a joke, uh, I still think I'm a joke, uh
I still think it ain't gon' work out
Nigga that shit is broke, broke, broke, broke

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Tell me, goddamn, what God made me for?
I don't even love no more
I don't even trust no more
I don't need to clutch no more
Some things outside of my control
I need some space, I need to grow
So I go, plague my soul
Say I won't
I never tried to let you go so deep, deep, deep, deep

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Know you got your own shit, and all of it together (My own session)
And you know you got your own space right here forever, baby (And my own blessing)
Know you got your own, know you got your own
Know you got your own, know you, know you got your own
Know you got your own shit, and all of it together (My own session)
And you know you got your own space right here forever, baby (And my own blessing)
You know you got your own, know you got your own
I know you got your own know you got your own

[Verse 3: bearface]
But I couldn't lie, you swear and you cry
Your teeth rotting while they fall onto mine
Pouring bleach on the white, won't bring them to life
Pliers twist to the right, pull out your mind
But I couldn't lie, you swear and you cry
Your teeth rotting while they fall onto mine
Pouring bleach on the white, won't bring them to life
Pliers twist to the right, pull out your mind

[Interlude: Dom McLennon & bearface]
I don't wanna take this ride
I don't wanna take this ride
Pouring bleach on the white, pouring bleach on the white, white, white
I don't wanna take this ride
Pouring bleach on the white, pouring bleach on the white, white, white
I don't wanna take this ride
Pouring bleach on the white, pouring bleach on the white, white, white
Pull out your mind

Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
She  chase a high that she'll never reach
Waste  her time with that ketamine
In her mind, it'll set her free
Why won't they let her breathe?
That  numbness‚ there ain't nothin' like that numbness
That  feelin' she in love with‚ let it go and say‚ "Fuck it" (Fuck it)
Yeah, fightin' with her mom, hard to get along
Everything  that you ever do is wrong
Things got complicated‚ she want to walk away (Walk away)
Help's on the way, turn the funeral to a holiday (To a holiday)
All the pain, the tear drops fall on her face
Like  waterfalls (Like waterfalls)
Just like waterfalls (Just like waterfalls)
She wants to be forgotten (Be forgotten)‚ lonely way too often
She can't stop it all (Stop it all)
As her conscious fade away (Fade away)
Colors fade to grey (Fade to grey)
She hate the day, can't sleep at night
In her dreams, she might just be alright
If she drops it all (Drops it all)
If she drops it all (She drops it all)

[Chorus]
Run, run
Chase them waterfalls (Chase them waterfalls), them waterfalls (Them waterfalls)
Run, run
This seems impossible (Impossible), impossible (Impossible)
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
She can't remember the last time that she smiled
No company around, she need somebody now
Mom was never proud, dad was never that interested
He was always outta town, scared she gonna drown
In them waterfalls (Waterfalls), in them waterfalls (Waterfalls)
She better off alone (Better off alone)
Nobody ever notice that she don't talk at all (Talk at all)
Yeah, it ain't nothin' like the old days
That pain resemblin' cold rain
She locked away in her own space
Got introduced to that cocaine and forgot it at all (Forgot it all)
Shouldn't have got involved (Got involved)

[Chorus]
Run, run
Chase them waterfalls (Chase them waterfalls), them waterfalls (Them waterfalls)
Run, run
This seems impossible (Impossible), impossible (Impossible)

Young NOLA‚ PlayStation controlla (Ayy, ayy)
Send 'em just to get 'em, I hit 'em when it is over (Ayy)
Roll over‚ yo soldier, no coaster

Send it back if them boys wanna feel the clover
No closure, never reply to faux orders

Police pull up on me, boy, I kept that cold shoulder (Ayy, ayy)
Cup runneth over for a hunnid orders (Ayy, ayy)
All I got is pennies, still want me to fuckin' flow, bruh (Ayy)

[Chorus]
There is no love in the ghetto
Money got it where I just can't let go
There is no love in the ghetto
Money got it where I just can't let go
Ooh-oh-ooh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
How you do that right there, boo, I'm bamboozled, yeah
Legs go up behind the head like leopard ambushin', huh
Give her space, big ol' drop, call it Grand Canyon, huh
She bust back, blow a fuse out the damn cannon
Circus, olé, okay (Yeah), roly (Woah)
Poly, slide that (Uh), pole, yeah, (Hm) low blow (Ooh)
Not seen like a dodo (No), I skip fall, stay snow globe (Ayy)
Stuck inside the corridor (Ayy), make me go so loco (Ayy)
Major League, I'm Sheen (Uh), call me Wild Thing (Uh)
She got strings all up the neck just like a violin (Ah)
I crave that chada-ching, when that venom sting (Hey)
Eyes turn redder than a motherfuckin' cherry stem

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Run up a check, ayy, uh (Run up a check)
Hit 'til I miss, ayy, uh (Hit 'til I miss)
And then keep on hittin'
My niggas ain't quittin', they way too legit, ayy, uh (They way too legit)
Don't get on my list, ayy, uh (Don't get on my list)
I'm from the abyss, ayy, uh (I'm from the abyss)
You sayin' you real
But I watch how you act and I can't be convinced, uh
Smokin' 'em out like a habit
You know we could make it tragic (Ayy)
Money had never made a nigga (Ayy)
We holdin' all our money in the mattress (Ayy)
Fire rapid like a savage (Ayy)
Taste is way above your palate (Ayy)
No, I ain't for burying the hatchet (Ayy)
Take a break to pick apart the balance of this madness

[Verse 4: bearface]
Uh
You got big boy money like you ready for war
You be talkin' like you really gon' run that though
You be runnin' like the snot drainin' in from your nose
That's that ice cream, sugar, that cocaine throat
And this shit gon' bounce like my shin off your dome
And you know these boys deep, we ain't fittin' in the door
And my dogs, they bark, Michael Vick on fours
Boy, this shit long gone, why you hit my phone? (Whoa!)

[Bridge]
See how full it is, homie
See how real it is
Hell no

[Outro: Merlyn Wood]
Murder man, murder man
Someone better hold me before this shit gets ugly
Murder man, murder man
Someone better–
Murder man, murder man
Someone better–
Murder man, man
Someone hold me b–, b–, shit gets ug–
Murder man, murder man
Someone better hold me before this shit gets ugly

[Verse 1]
I swear I'm losing patience
For all of these fucking situations
And I swear I never say shit
But this time I'm gonna say it

[Pre-Chorus]
When the record's on the final song
And the parties will be long, long gone
All the pretenders and the hangers on
Can go find themselves another one

[Chorus]
But it ain't a thing, yeah
But it ain't a thing
But it, but it ain't a thing, yeah
But it, but it ain't a thing
It ain't a thing, baby

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, it ain't a thing, baby

[Verse 2]
I swear I'm losing patience (For all of these, for all of these)
All of these fucking altercations
Yeah, and I swear I never say shit (Said, never said shit, did I?)
But this time I really mean it

[Pre-Chorus]
When the record's on the final song
And the parties will be long, long gone
All the pretenders and the hangers on
Can go find themselves another one

[Chorus]
But it ain't a thing, yeah
But it ain't a thing
But it, but it ain't a thing, yeah
But it, but it ain't a thing
It ain't a thing, baby

[Post-Chorus]
It ain't a thing, baby

It ain't a thing, baby

[Post-Chorus]
It ain't a thing, baby
But it ain't a thing, ain't a thing
It ain't a thing, baby

[Verse 1]
Alone, I'm searching for devotion
In  a faded melody
My  soul is trying to cross an ocean
Down on bended knee
Lock up my cadence and rhyme
Don't  know what I'm trying to say
My  heart, all the time was stolen by bad poetry

[Chorus]
Some nights I talk to myself
I  say the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I say the words I never said when you were with me
Some nights I talk to myself
I  say the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I say the words I never said when you were with me

[Verse 2]
I'm gone, the nightmares cut me open
Love's insanity
So long, words are left unspoken
I couldn't set them free
Watch all the language run dry, thoughts go on holiday
My heart, I'm left with a broken vocabulary

[Bridge]
Some nights I talk to myself
I say the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I say the words I never said when you were with me

[Chorus]
Some nights I talk to myself
I say the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I say the words I never said when you were with me
Some nights I talk to myself
I say the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I say the words I never said when you were with me

[Chorus]
It gets better, baby (Better baby)
I want you, baby (I want you baby), yeah
It gets better, baby (Better baby), woo
Let me love you
It gets better, baby (Better baby)
I want you, baby (I want you baby), yeah
It gets better, baby (Better baby), woo
Let me love you

[Break]
Let me love you

[Chorus]
It gets better, baby (Better baby)
I want you baby (I want you baby), yeah
It gets better, baby (Better baby), woo
Let me love you

[Break]
It gets better, baby
It gets better, it gets better, baby
It gets better, it gets better, baby
It gets better, it gets better, baby
It gets better, it gets better, baby

[Outro]
Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, mama, said the way you move
Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove
Ah, ah, child, way you shake that thing
Gonna make you burn, gonna make you sting
Hey, hey, baby, when you walk that way
Watch y' honey drip, can't keep away

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I gotta roll, can't stand still
Got a flaming heart, can't get my fill
Eyes that shine, burning red
Dreams of you all through my head

[Break]
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ahh

[Bridge]
Hey baby, oh baby, pretty baby
Tell me would you do me now
Hey baby, oh baby, pretty baby
Move me while you groove me now

[Verse 3]
Take too long 'fore I found out
What people mean by down and out
Spent my money, took my car
Started tellin' her friend she' gon' be a star
I don't know, but I've been told
A big-legged woman ain't got no soul

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 4]
All I ask for, all I pray
Steady rollin' woman gonna come my way
Need a woman gonna hold my hand
Won't tell me no lies, make me a happy man

[Break]
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ahh

[Outro]
Oooh ahhh!...
Tell me would you do me now
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Tell me would you do me now
Babe, babe, ooh, keep doin' now
Push me, babe, push me, babe, push me, babe, push me, babe, push me, babe, push me, babe, push me, babe
Ooooo, feels good
Ooooo, feels good now

[Verse 1]
Took a trip to San Francisco
All  our friends said we would jive
Didn't  work, so I left for Fresno
It was quite a scenic drive
Pulled over to watch the children in the park
We  used to only worry for them after dark

[Chorus]
I’m  still looking for my own version of America
One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly
No  bombs in the sky, only fireworks when you and I collide
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind
It’s just a dream I had in mind

[Verse 2]
I  flew back to New York City
Missed that Hudson River line
Took a train up to Lake Placid
That's another place and time, where
I used to go to drive-ins and listen to the blues
So many things that I think twice about before I do now

[Chorus]
I'm still looking for my own version of America
One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly
No bombs in the sky, only fireworks when you and I collide
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind

[Verse 1: Eminem]

Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off, beat him over the fucking head with a peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with a 40 mixed up with alka seltzer and formula 4D
Fuck a acid tab, I strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait till it absorbed in then I fell to the floor dead
No more saying, case closed end of discussion
I'm blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
Leavin' you in the aftermath of Holocaust and traumas
Across the the bombers, we blowin' up your house
Killing your parents, and coming back to get for mamas
And I'm as good as keeping a promise as Nostradamus
I ain't making no more threats. I'm doing drive by's in tinted corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head. Maybe more
Cause' I smoked cracked today, yesterday, and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a Labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore. Verbal cow manure
Comin' together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure!
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless. Patrolling Corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth for a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe
Beating James 

[?] Senior, smacking his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in a wild hood, was a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I use as an excuse
And ain't shit change, I kept the same mind state since the 3rd time I failed 9th grade
You prolly think that I'm a negative person. Don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death, cause' I fall down a cement flight of steps and land inside a bed of spider webs
Throw cautions in the wind, you and a friend can jump off a bridge and if you live do it again
Shit why not! Blow your brain out. I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, You only live once, you might as well die now!

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]

I squat like a blunts tips, something cavi
Making green like Mitch. Gift rap vocals dispatch
With every attempt I had this game shook up
When Dre cook up. Every thug look up
Chronic got me on chill. Eyes bloodshot heavy built
Lay a nigga out like quil. Clear the guilt!
I rock Corollas from low riders to henny toasters
Cut off dead weight to keep my formulas Kosher
Accept no invitations. Dre losing his stack
Slimmest chances, of Michael Jackson getting his black fans back. My reputation is like a tech nine, and I got the best in the circle
Three minutes wreck

[?] time. See the hand faster than the eye can chase it
Dre, b-real, soul assassins got potential buttons activated
No illusion I have you caught up in a rapture
Executive decisions, from the mother fucking puppet master

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I  couldn't be there even when I tried
You  don't believe it, we do this every time

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Verse 2]
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Bridge]
Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Verse 1]
Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
My song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Verse 2]
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made (oh)
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Bridge]
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

[Outro]
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

[Intro: T-Pain]
Get this paper (Woo), get this paper, come get this paper (Yeah)
Yeah,  get this paper, get this paper, come get this paper

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Me and my girl need a girlfriend, and it might be you

Me  and my girl need a girlfriend, shit, and right now you'll do (Yeah, you'll do)

I'm throwin' 50 bands tonight, a few tuitions like

Fit three in a two-seater, swerve in each lane (Vroom)
Found out she was a squirter, now my sheets stained (Wow)

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Me and my girl need a girlfriend, and it might be you
(And it might be you)
Me and my girl need a girlfriend, shit, and right now you'll do (Yeah, you'll do)
I tell her sign this application
Get this paper, come get this paper
I tell her sign this application
Get this paper, come get this paper
Me and my girl need a...

[Verse 1]
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
To the Houses of the Holy, smokin' on them cigarettes
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was cool as heck
He was cool as heck

[Pre-Chorus]
And we were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
That we gave all we had ’til the time we got to bed
'Cause we knew we could
We were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
'Cause we were just that good
It was just that good

[Chorus]
Whatever’s on tonight‚ I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight‚ I'm taking off my bathing suit
You make me feel like
There's something that I never knew I wanted

[Verse 2]
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was '70s in spirit‚ '90s in his frame of mind
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
We lost track of space
We lost track of time

[Pre-Chorus]
And we were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
That we gave all we had 'til the time we got to bed
'Cause we knew we could
We were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
’Cause we were just that good
It was just that good

[Chorus]
Whatever’s on tonight, I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight, I’m taking off my bathing suit
You make me feel like
There's something that I never knew I wanted
We play the Eagles down in Malibu and I want it

[Bridge]
It's you‚ all the roads lead to you
Everything I want and do, all the things that I say
It's true, all the roads lead to you
Like the 405 I drive through
Every night and every day
I see you for who you really are
Why the thousands of girls love
The way Bill plays guitar

[Chorus]
Whatever’s on tonight‚ I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight, I'm taking off my bathing suit
You make me feel like
There's something that I never knew I wanted
We play the Eagles down in Malibu and I want it
There's something that I never knew I wanted

[Verse 1]
Never met a good girl with her ass to the ceiling (To the ceiling)

[Chorus]

If you leave me, nights will never be lonely, bae
Lot of lonely girls and they want me, bae
With they ass to the ceiling like

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Hallelujah, holy lion‚ word to Judas
How I'm supposed to‚ (Hey) trust what you say is the truest? (Right)
Haile Selassie‚ (Uh) insha'Allah if I gotta (Woo)
Spin my words around as if you wanted a mandala for Nirvana
Singin' a sonata towards our karma
Did a rain dance, bringin' commas from Tacoma to Oaxaca
I got spirits in my heart that make my mind move like it's water
Flow into the moment and avoid the melodrama
Gotta breathe for a second
Can't believe anybody still testin'
My whole team is a force to be reckoned with
Operatin' like specialists
One to the two to the who are you?
Sendin' out projections with prejudice
My attention to detail is in scale with classic impressionists
So the lesson is that prerequisites are irrelevant to my standards (Right)
It's a deficit in your settlement, you better learn to mind all your manners (Right)
My whole troop been goin' bananas
Try and step inside of our jungle (Right)
You can try to take all your chances
We won't help your ass if you stumble‚ nigga (Right)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Hidin' at my partner house
Couple bands'll send 'em out
'Stead of feelin' trippy, dawg
You need to help your city out
Hidin' at my partner house
Couple bands'll send 'em out
'Stead of feelin' trippy, dawg
You need to help your city out

[Post-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Couple...
Couple...
Couple...
Couple bands'll‚ couple bands'll—

Couple bands'll, couple bands'll—

[Verse 2: Matt Champion and Merlyn Wood]
Watch your back, (Ayy) don't leave your door cracked (Yeah, yeah)
Slither through your space and watch it all collapse (Yeah)
Watch your back, (What?) don't leave your door cracked (Woohoo)
Slither through your space and watch it all collapse (If you, if you, if you, if you, hey)

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
If you want a feature, we can figure it out
Want a color for your album? We can figure it out
How you not invite the boys who colored your rollout
Then you copy-paste hard work from the BH house?
I always got somethin' to say when you take food from my mouth
I begged my mommy for money until the day it ran out
They say, "We helped you when and when, now you should figure it out"
Figure it out

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Hidin' at my partner house
Couple bands'll send 'em out
'Stead of feelin' trippy, dawg
You need to help your city out
Hidin' at my partner house
Couple bands'll send 'em out

[Verse 4: Joba]
Waste your breath, watch the tone though
Take you to the dojo
Roll up my doja, sticky fingers
At the door, bruh, Jehovah, you ho bitch
Witness sadistic shit, will come again
Next time I take my belt off, spank you
Bad kid, bad seed, not me, got beef
I leave body, blackout from rage
Childproof my pockets, don't need the options
Romanticizing what I do if I ain't stop me
Can be off me, tread lightly

[Bridge]
Break the law, break the law
Break the law, break the law
Break the law, break the law
Break the law

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
I'm tired of making a fool out of me and you
Is there anything that I can do that'll save us, baby?
Is there anybody lovin' lies and robbin' shotties
45's and still alive, and no drunk drivin'
That's how they killed my brother
(Walking with Jesus)
You know, you know better, better, better, better, better
Better, better, better, better, better, better, better, bet on it
Better bet on it, better bet on it, hey
(Walking with Jesus)
You know, you know better
Better, better, better, bet, bet on it
Bet on it, ayy, ayy, yeah
Ayy, yeah
I wanna sing, I wanna
I wanna sing, ooh
(Just tell 'em, tell 'em that)
Ah, cool
(Walking with Jesus Christ)
(Walking with the Lord)
Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
One, two, three, and, and

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I don't care if you there when I leave
When I'm gone, tag along, we both weak
I don't care, don't take my money
Take my money, the hood still love me
I don't care if you there (I don't care if you there) when I leave
When I'm gone, tag along (When I'm gone, tag along), we both weak
I don't care (I don't care if you–), don't take my money (I don't care)
Take my money (I don't care if you–), the hood still love me (I don't care)
(I don't care if you there)

[Lisa Simpson]:
I used to think that I was stupid
Worthless weak and wrong
A mockingbird without a song
I was small inside
Left and ride
On a one-way train to be Milhouse's bride

[Milhouse Van Houten]:
End this song, end it right here!

I love NPR and jazz guitars
And may design a solar car
That's right
I'm Lisa Simpson superstar

[Lady Gaga]:
You've got a great big heart
That's at the top of the chart

[Both]:
Lisa Simpson
Lisa Simpson
Lisa Simpson superstar
Lisa Simpson
Lisa Simpson
Lisa Simpson superstar

[Lady Gaga]:
You're a superstar
Listen
I've got the sickest ambition
Deep in the mirror I am scared
Don't know who the hell is there
Yeah, I'm losing my reflection

Obsession
It's the thing, it's our new religion
Each model and celebrity
Changes how I look at me
Oh, don't tell me, don't tell me
I'll never be

A superstar 'cause I know I could
Look like a girl in Hollywood
Hollywood, Hollywood
In Hollywood, In Hollywood

Women
Let's talk about our condition
Now beauty's a commodity
Nip and tuck your fantasy
But your better live with your revisions
I have a vision
It's a world without these decisions
Sure Hollywood's commercially
Glamorous but naturally's the way to be
And you can't tell me I'm not sexy

I'm a superstar, And I know I could
Look like a girl in Hollywood, Hollywood
Hollywood
Hollywood, Hollywood

You know I could
Hollywood, Hollywood

Oh within a year I know I could
Oh look like a girl in Hollywood
Oh a superstar, yeah I know I could
Look like a girl in Hollywood

I could
Hollywood

Hollywood, Hollywood
Hollywood, Hollywood yeah
Hollywood, Hollywood
Within the year I know I could
Look like a girl in Hollywood
Like superstars, yeah I know I could
Look like a girl in Hollywood
In Hollywood, Hollywood

[Verse 1]
I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I’d be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like?

[Chorus]
I’m so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

[Verse 2]
They'd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn’t shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves

[Pre-Chorus]
And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play
I’d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I’d get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I’d be the man
I'd be the man

[Bridge]
What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So, it's okay that I'm mad

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man)
Then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Oh)
I'd be the man (Yeah)
I'd be the man (I'd be the man)

[Outro]
If I was a man, then I'd be the man

[Verse 1]
Will I stop crying for once?
It's hurtin' my eyes
There's a difference between lonely and lonesome
But I'm both all the time
Yeah, I'm both all the time

[Verse 2]
I don't let myself out
But I like it like that
I don't get the point of leaving my house
'Cause I always come back
Yeah‚ always come back

[Verse 3]
And I'm too scared to look
I never know what happens
So I keep rereading the same book
'Cause I know how it ends
Yeah‚ I know how it ends

[Verse 4]
And I'm loneliest at night
After my shower beer
And I'll go to sleep without turning out the lights
Pretend like somebody's here
Pretend like somebody's here

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you...

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn't real
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
And I say to you...

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

[Bridge: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]
And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to?
What am I supposed to do
If there's no you?

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
This won't go back to normal, if it ever was
It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because
'Cause I have to

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]
Ooh-ah
You'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

[Verse 1]
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

[Verse 2]
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

[Bridge]
And I can still see it all (In my mind)
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
I once believed love would be (Black and white)
But it's golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
I once believed love would be (Burning red)
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
(And I can still see it all)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(I once believed love would be burning red)

[Outro]
Like daylight
It's golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go

[Spoken Outro]
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
I, I just think that
You are what you love

[Verse 1]
We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

[Chorus]
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Verse 2]
Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

[Pre-Chorus]
But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I

[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Bridge]
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen

[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Post-Chorus]
I don't wanna lose you (Hope it never ends)
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I don't wanna lose you (Yeah)

[Outro]
"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car

[Verse 1]
You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

[Verse 2]
My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

[Bridge]
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), just thought you should know
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win)

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
Oh, I just thought you should know (You should know)
It's you and me, there's nothing like this (Like this)
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue (Paint it blue)
Voted most likely to run away with you

[Post-Chorus]
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win), just thought you should know

[Outro]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
"She's a bad, bad girl"

[Verse 1]
I think he knows
His footprints on the sidewalk
Lead to where I can't stop
Go there every night
I think he knows
His hands around a cold glass
Make me wanna know that
Body like it's mine

[Pre-Chorus]
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
It's like I'm 17, nobody understands
No one understands

[Chorus]
He got my heartbeat
Skipping down 16th Avenue
Got that, ah, I mean
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

[Verse 2]
I think he knows
When we get all alone
I'll make myself at home
And he'll want me to stay
I think he knows
He'd better lock it down
Or I won't stick around
'Cause good ones never wait (Ha)

[Pre-Chorus]
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
He's so obsessed with me and, boy, I understand
Boy, I understand

[Chorus]
He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue
Got that, ah, I mean (I mean)
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

[Post-Chorus]
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my soul

[Bridge]
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We could follow the sparks, I'll drive
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We could follow the sparks, I'll drive
"So where we gonna go?"
I whisper in the dark
"Where we gonna go?"
I think he knows

[Chorus]
He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue (Baby)
Got that, ah, I mean (I mean)
Wanna see what's under that attitude like (Yeah)
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

[Post-Chorus]
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my (Oh, baby)
I want you, bless my soul (He got my heartbeat)
I want you, bless my (Skipping down 16th Avenue, baby)

[Intro]
Oh my God

[Verse 1]
Oh, something’s wrong with me
Homesick for LA
In the summer of my life
That’s when we first met
Through a friend
Something about you makes me feel like a kid
Was it a dream or is it all in the past?
I just thought I ask

[Chorus]
So I turn back the time
I’m at the chateau and I feel alright
I turn back the time
I’m at the chateau and I feel alright

[Verse 2]
The roof in the rain
It's true
I could feel the pain
Of my head, seeing stars
You said “Come to ours”
So I did
It's a decision that I'm glad that I made
I'm still uncertain that it happened at all
I just can't recall

[Chorus]
So I turn back the time
I’m at the chateau and I feel alright
I turn back the time
I’m at the chateau and I feel alright
I turn back the time
I’m at the chateau and I feel alright
I turn back the time
I’m at the chateau and I feel alright
So I turn back the time
I’m at the chateau and I feel alright
So I turn back the time
I’m at the chateau and I feel—

[Verse 1]
I needed someone to depend upon
I was alone, I was emotional
Searching for the right emoticon
To expand my mental lexicon

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Then Gemma told me that she met someone
It was the person I'd been counting on
It felt good, it felt transitional
A feeling I'd been waiting on

[Chorus]
You were floating like a lilo
With your eyes closed, going where the tide goes
Caught in flux, you drifted 'til you hit the sides
Hold my breath another minute
I can keep my head, there's nothing in it
I'm a patient wave
And it's an easy ride

[Verse 2]
I saw myself an intellectual
I thought that I was capable
Every move was just habitual
And life was just a ritual

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Then Gemma told me that she met somebody
Nobody else could take me from myself
I wasn't searching for it anymore
The feeling I'd been waiting for

[Chorus]
You were floating like a lilo
With your eyes closed, going where the tide goes
Caught in flux, you drifted 'til you hit the sides
Hold my breath another minute
I can keep my head, there's nothing in it
I'm a patient wave
And it's an easy ride

You were floating like a lilo
With your eyes closed, going where the tide goes
Caught in flux, you drifted 'til you hit the sides
Hold my breath another minute
I can keep my head, there's nothing in it
I'm a patient wave
And it's an easy ride

[Verse 1]
Did something change? I don’t really care anyway
You  can go write something about it, and I’m
Sure  I’ll like it, I like what you write about me

I’m insane, you said I don’t feel the same when you’re gone
Oh, try being here when your head's so numb
I  have nothing to say about anyone

[Pre-Chorus]
My  mistake, I made this about me
And I wrapped you around me like a blanket
I  hate it, I hate myself

[Chorus]
Yes I was wrong, I was mean
I created such a scene
And my demons within
But  I’m changing

[Verse 2]
Did something change? I don’t really care anyway
You can go write something about it, and I’m
Sure I’ll like it, I like what you write about me
Either way, I’m just another stone in the ground
I’m not someone that you'd come looking for
I’m just somebody you found

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I think I need my family ‘round
I’m standing on my head and the world is upside down
I guess it’s still turning

[Chorus]
Yes I was wrong, I was mean
I created such a scene
And my demons within
But I’m changing

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I start believing in things that aren't real
And my friend likes to deceive me in the way that I feel but

[Pre Chorus]
All these things don’t happen to anybody like you
These things don’t matter to anybody but

[Chorus]
Oh, you seemed so happy to everybody you knew
These things don’t happen to anybody like you

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I start concealing
The way that I work in my head
Can't take it anymore
I won't stop feeling the weight of my world and

[Pre Chorus]
All these things don’t matter to anybody like you
These things don’t matter to anybody but

[Chorus]
Oh, you seemed so happy to everybody you knew
These things don’t happen to anybody like-
Oh, you seemed so happy to everybody you knew
These things don’t happen to anybody like you

[Bridge]
All these things don’t matter
All these things don’t matter
To anybody like

[Chorus]
Oh, you seemed so happy to everybody you knew
These things don’t happen to anybody like-
Oh, you seemed so happy to everybody you knew
These things don’t happen to anybody like you

[Verse 1]
Up in my head
I'm the only one around

[Chorus]
'Cause somehow
Everybody hates me now

[Verse 2]
The sky seems clear
But I can only see the clouds

[Chorus]
'Cause somehow
Everybody hates me now

[Verse 3]
I've over-extended
Replaced all of my friends with
A linen sheet, a takeaway box
And an incomplete crossword block
With nothing left to show for it
She's sleeping on the sofa
It’s like she doesn't know that I exist

[Chorus]
Everybody hates me now
Everybody hates me now
Everybody hates me now

[Intro]
Lord knows, it just ain't fair
Give me some volume, give me some volume
You know, when hear the word queen
You automatically think of a woman getting everything she wants
But it's not like that at all (At all)
See, being a ruler means sacrifice (Sacrifice)
Most of the time, you get less than what you give (What you give)
So every woman and mother in the world is a queen
Because she sacrificed so much (So much)

[Verse 1]
Get so lonely sometimes
Some times I gotta clear my mind
Can't stop walking on water
Feels like I'm dealing at the altar
Gets so heavy sometimes
Carrying this weight of mine
Looks like the seas are partin'
So I might as well start walkin'

[Chorus]
Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord
They just don't know, know, know
How hard I had to go, go, go
To get through, to get through
They just don't know, know, know, know
Know, know, know
How many times I lost (How many times I lost)
Just so I could win (Ooh, yeah)
They just don't know, know, know, know
Oh, no, no
How many times I've died (How many times I've died)
Just to live again, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
When life was coming at me quick, I had to tuck in my emotions (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I know He watchin', God, I made it look good, I was chosen
Gone through hell to get to heaven, build a bridge and get over
My snap-back's real, still thick in these jeans, I ain't missing no meals

[Chorus]
Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord
They just don't know, know, know
How hard I had to go, go, go
To get through, to get through
They just don't know, know, know, know (Know, know, know)
Know, know, know
How many times I've lost (How many times I've lost)
Just so I could win (Ooh, yeah)
They just don't know, know, know, know
Oh, no, no
How many times I've died (No, they just don't know)
Just to live again (No, they just don't know)

[Outro]
They just don't know, know, know, know (Know, know, know)
Know, know, know
How many times I've lost (How many times I've lost)
Just so I could win (Woo, yeah)
They just don't know, know, know, know
Oh, no, no
How many times I've died (No, they just don't know)
Just to live again (No, they just don't know), yeah

[Verse 1]
Hey, everyday of the week, I'm in a different city
If I stay too long, the people try to pull me down, you know what I mean
They talk about me like a dog, talk about the clothes I wear
But they don't realize they're the ones who's square baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, and that's why you can't hold me down
I don't want to be tied down
I got to move on
Hey!

[Chorus]
Stone free, hey to do what I please baby
Stone free, I said to ride the breeze
Stone free, yeah I can't stay
Got to, got to get away
Hey!
Turn me loose baby

[Verse 2]
Listen to this
Women here, women there, try to keep me in a plastic cage
But they don't realize that it's so easy to break baby
Yeah but sometimes
Sometimes I can feel my heart kind of getting hot
That's when I got to move, before I get caught

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't you understand that's why
Hey you can't hold me down
I don't want to be tied down
I got to move on
Hey!

[Chorus]
Stone free, hey to do what I please baby
Stone free, whoa to ride the breeze, ride the breeze
Stone free, I can't stay
Got to, got to get away
Woo
So relax your grip

[Guitar solo]
Got to be free, got to be free
Got to be free, and ride the breeze
Got to be free, got to be free
Do what I please, do what I please

[Chorus]
Stone free, yeah to ride the breeze baby
Stone free, to do what I please
Stone free, yeah I can't stay
Stone free, 

[?] got to get away

[Outro]
Stone free, hey I'm gone baby right now
Stone free, don't turn on me back
Hey
Stone free, I'm moving on down the highway baby
Stone free

[Verse 1]
It's spinning me around again
Like a little girl in a pink dress, oh
Darkness was my only friend
Up until the moment we met, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And I held you so close
And you said

[Chorus]
Where do you go when you go?
What do you take of your weary soul?
Oh, where do you go when you go?
Oh, I just wanna know

[Verse 2]
It’s spinning me around again
Like a young girl in a prom dress, oh
With all this worry in my head
I'll stay up as late as I can, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Til you come home, come home
And tell me

[Chorus]
Where do you go when you go?
What do you take of your weary soul?
Oh, where do you go when you go?
I just wanna know, yeah

[Bridge]
It’s spinning me around again
In and out of touch with the second hand
Oh, time stops, and I'll go

[Pre-Chorus]
But tell me

[Chorus]
Where do I go when I go?
What do I take of your weary soul?
Oh, where do I go when I go?
I just wanna know
Ooh, I just wanna know
I just want to, I just want to
I just wanna know, oh
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna

[Outro]
The fire is burnin'
Much brighter than before
For you

[Verse 1]
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Bridge]
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Verse 1: Bowie & Marianne]
They say we're young and we don't know
We won't find out until we grow
Well I don't know if all that's true
Cause you got me, and baby I got you

[Chorus: Bowie & Marianne]
Babe
I got you babe, I got you babe

[Verse 2: Bowie & Marianne]
They say our love won't pay the rent
Before it's earned, our money's all been spent
I guess that's so, we don't have a pot
But at least I'm sure of all the things we got

[Chorus: Both]
Babe
I got you babe, I got you babe

[Verse 3: Bowie & Marianne]
I got flowers in the spring, I got you to wear my ring
And when I'm sad, you're a clown
And if I get scared, you're always around
So let them say your hair's too long
Cause I don't care, with you I can't go wrong
Then put your little hand in mine
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb

[Chorus: Both]
Babe
I got you babe, I got you babe

[Bridge: Bowie & Marianne]
I got you to hold my hand
I got you to understand
I got you to walk with me
I got you to talk with me
I got you to kiss goodnight
I got you to hold me tight
I got you, I won't let go
I got you to love me so

[Chorus: Both]
I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe

[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Automatic, make cash, get wasted
Automatic, make cash, get wasted
Make mama panic, boys talk to me colored
I'm a kid, damn it, I’m not a-
This is my bar and you know it
You never came in here before I showed it to you
And now I see you walking through that door
With a dress that I've been waiting for
And I know what you're trying to do
And I know what you want me to say
Funny, I was thinking about you yesterday

Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care
Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care

I used to worship the ground you walked on
And you walked all over me
And you looked me in the eye and said goodbye
And you did it so casually
And I know what you're trying to do
'Cause I see who you're talking to
And you send your pretty little eyes my way

But oh, I just remembered that I didn't care
Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care
You can try, you can try
But I’m way to high to fight it anyway
Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care, I didn't care
And I don't want someone, who don't want someone
Who wants someone all the way
And I don't want someone, who don't want someone
Who don't want someone to ever get away

Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care
Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care
You can try, you can try
But I’m way to high to fight it anyway
Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care, I didn't care

Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care
Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care

But if you ain't hip to the rare house quake:

Maybe you're just like my mother (maybe you're just like my mother)
She's never satisfied (never, never satisfied)

This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

I’d  like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade

In his octopus’s garden in the shade
I’d ask my friends to come and see
An octopus’s garden with me

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road, yes he does
Saving up to buy some clothes, yes he is
He keeps a ten-bob note up his nose, yes he does
He's such a mean old man, yes he is
He's such a mean old man, yes he is

His sister Shelly works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
She's slaving up to look at the queen, god save the queen
Only place that he's ever been, god save the queen
Always shouts out something obscene
He's such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

[John Lennon]
His sister Bernice works in a furnace
Well, you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking but she looks like a man
Well‚ you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes‚ you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah‚ yeah, yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl that makes the "News of the World"
Yes, you could say she was attractively built
Yeah‚ yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
You've got my head spinnin', no kiddin'
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause all, all, all...
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

[Verse 2]
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around
Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's under water, but I'm breathin' fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

'Cause I give you all

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
Oh yeah

You Never Give Me Your Money

[Verse 1]
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

[Verse 2]
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

[Verse 3]
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any job, I got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go

[Verse 4]
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today
Yes, it did

Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she doesn't have a lot to say

Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home

Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry

Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

Carry that weight a long time

Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
...Uh-uh, uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh
Blowin' up, blowin' up, blowin' up
I love freak bitches, blowin' up, blowin' up, blowin' up
Bad little white house blowin' up, blowin' up, blowin' up
Whole gang gettin' bitches, blowin' up, blowin' up, blowin' up
Blowin' up

[Verse 2: Lancey Foux]
I walk in spectacular, Spyder, tarantula
Creep on the opps, I pull up and done 'em
I just picked out a diamond, it land like a carat
It ain't drip, this is dressin', my pockets are salad
I just picked up the cabbage, got more in the calendar
It goes on for days and weeks and years
I keep hearin' money, I keep doin' claims
She was just in my mind, now she ruinin' my head
She fell in love, fell in love, fell in love
Ruinin' my mind, she fell in love, fell in love, fell in love
With the bag, she fell in love, fell in love, fell in love
Ruinin' my mind, she fell in love, fell in love, fell in love...

[Intro]
She...!

[John]  It's the case of one awful one after another!
What's  it the case of, Mr. Martin?

[George Martin] Take four was very good up to the breakdown...

[John] Which was take four?

[George  Martin] ...and it was very good until the end bit there when Paul did his bit that wasn't quite right

[John]  My boys are ready to go!

[Glyn Johns] John?

[John]  Yes? What?

[Glyn Johns] It is possible without affecting yourselves too much to turn down a little? Apparently there's been a complaint

[John] From who?

[Glyn Johns] From somebody outside the building

[John]  What are they doing here at this time of night?

[Ringo] It's that guy

[John] What guy?

[Ringo] The last time, he complained...

[Paul] It's his own fault for getting a house in such a lousy district!

[John] Well, we'll try it once more very loud
And if we don't get it, we'll try it quiet like you might do it the other way
Okay, the loud one, last go
Last chance to be loud!

[George Harrison] Who says?

[John] Can't quite see through these now
I just can't see them, they keep merging

One-two-three, one-two-three

[Verse]
I want you
I want you so bad, baby
I want you
I want you so bad, it's driving me mad
It's driving me mad
I want you
I want you so bad
I want you
I want you so bad, it's driving me mad
It's driving me...
I want you
I want you so bad
I want you
I want you so bad, it's driving me mad
It's driving me mad
I want you
You know I want you so bad
I want you
I want you so bad, it's driving me mad
It's driving me mad
Yeah!

[Chorus]
She's so...

[Instrumental Outro]

[Engineer] Something, this is take 1

[George] Are you going? Oh

[Verse 1]
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

[Pre-Bridge]
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

[Pre-Bridge]
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Bridge]
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know

You know I love that woman of mine
And I need her all of the time
Now I'm telling you
That woman, that woman don't make me blue

[Verse 3]
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

[Pre-Bridge]
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

You know I believe and how

[John] Mal?

[Mal Evans] Hello

[John] Un string avec caput, Mal!
We gotta get faster, Ringo!

[Paul] Okay, George!

[John] Okay?

[Verse 1]
Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said, "You've got to go back"
You know they didn't even give us a chance

[Chorus]
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Verse 2]
Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say
"You can make it O.K
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain"

[Chorus]
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Verse 3]
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The news people said, "Say what you doing in bed?"
I said, "We're only trying to get us some peace"

[Chorus]
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Bridge]
Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said
"Poor boy, when you're dead
You don't take nothing with you
But your soul - think!"

[Verse 4]
Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
The newspaper said, "She's gone to his head
They look just like two gurus in drag"

[Chorus]
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Verse 5]
Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press said, "We wish you success
It's good to have the both of you back"

[Chorus]
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me!
Da da da
Da da da

[John] Yeah, we'll have him, we'll have him!

[Short drum solo]

[George] One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
I want a love that's right
But right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl
Who sometimes wears it twice as long

[Chorus 1]
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now, I'm telling you

[Verse 2]
You know you pick me up
From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile
Replacing every thoughtless frown

[Chorus 2]
Got me escaping from this zoo
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you

[Bridge]
If I grow up I'll be a singer
Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say
I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather
If you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

[Verse 3]
I want that love of yours
To miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late

[Chorus 3]
For your sweet top lip I'm in the queue
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you

[Outro]
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you

[George] Okay
Uh, oh, what's this?

[Paul] Two, three

[Verse 1]
Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm

[Verse 2]
Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Don't ever leave me alone

[Chorus]
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me that you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and died

[Verse 3]
Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me, darling

[Chorus]
When you told me (woo!) you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and died

[Verse 4]
Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never let you down
(Oh! Believe me, darling)
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm

[Paul] Okay, alright, you win
I'm  in love with you
Okay,  you win
I'm in love with you
Well alright, okay
Okay

Walnetto sandwich

Okay, come on lads, here it is, boys, here it is, come on, boys
Leslie off, please

It's exactly half-past-2, and it's 36
And  here we go!

[Steve Vaughan] 36

[Verse 1]
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

[Verse 2]
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

Out of college, money spent

Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go

Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today

Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here

[Verse 2]
Little darling, the smile's returning to their faces
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Verse 3]
Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun, doo-dun doo-doo
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Outro]
Here comes the sun, doo-dun doo-doo
Here comes the sun, I say
It's all right
Paul: Tell you what
Do, do more sort of a (scatters a drum solo) you know
*Ringo mimics Paul*
Paul: Yes, just something a bit more because it sounds a bit dead when you hear it, just as an intro
*Paul continues to scatter*
Paul: Yeah. Uh, do that one (Scatters and plays the piano to bass chords)
*George attempts to mimic Paul*

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Joan was quizzical, studied pataphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
"Can I take you out to the pictures
Joa, oa, oa, oan?"

But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head, do do do do do
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

[Verse 2]
Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant
Sce, e, e, ene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times "I must not be
So, o, o, o"

But as she turns her back on the boy
He rose up from behind

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

[singing]

[Verse 3]
*gibberish*
Painting testimonial pictures
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Valerie
Gallery
Free
Agree and he tells him
So, o, o, o

But as his words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from the back

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead

[singing]

[Outro]

Paul: One more
It was good, you know, it had nice bits in it
It would be nice to have the nice bits and the other bits
George: And the bad bits
Paul: And the bad bits, yeah (Laughs)
Ringo: George Harrison is resting his arm
Paul: Let it be known unto the people 

[laughing]
George: Kick out the jams, take 8
Ringo: Brothers and sisters!

[Intro banter]
Ha ha. Stop!
Five
He shut his eyes and came out on "wear no shootballs"
(Don't worry if you don't get the vocal, just keep going)
Okay, sorry. Yes. I get very involved, ya know?
One, two, a-one, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Here come old flat-top, he come groovin' up slowly
He got ju-ju eyeballs, he's one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
He's got to be a joker, he just do what he please

[Interlude]
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Look out!

[Verse 2]
He wear no shoeshine, he got toe-jam football
He got monkey finger, he shoot Coca-Cola
He say, "I know you, you know me"
One thing I can tell you, you got to be free

[Chorus]
Come together, right now
Over me

[Interlude]
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Hey!

[Verse 3]
He bag production, he got walrus gumboot
He got Ono sideburns, he one spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knees
He hold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease

[Chorus]
Come together, right now
Over me
Yeah

[Guitar Solo + Verse 1]
Hey! He comes--he come groovin' up slowly
He got ju-ju eyeballs, he's one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
He's got to be a joker, he just do what he please
Look out!
Hit me

[Outro banter]
He roller-coaster, he got early warnin'
He's got darus dookers
Yes
A man like him would have it
He's got teenage lyrics
He's got hot-rod baldie
I'm losing my cool

[Verse 1]
I want a love that's right
But right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl
Who sometimes wears it twice as long

[Chorus 1]
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now, I'm telling you

[Verse 2]
You know you pick me up
From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile
Replacing every thoughtless frown

[Chorus 2]
Got me escaping from this zoo
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you

[Bridge]
If I grow up I'll be a singer
Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say
I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather
If you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

[Verse 3]
I want that love of yours
To miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late

[Chorus 3]
For your sweet top lip I'm in the queue
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you

[Outro]
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you

[Spoken Word: Jerrod Carmichael]
Exactly what you run from, you end up chasing. Like, you can't avoid, but just chasing it and just like trying. Giving it everything that you can. There's always an obstacle-

[Verse 1]
I hate when it rains, all I really do is sit on my ass
Thinking of the next scheme just to double my cash
If I ain't thinking about cash, nigga I'm thinking bout' life
Making a change, no winners do the same shit twice
Rainy days are a pain, felt the rush through my veins
Can't go to sleep, somebody's looking through my window pane
Mane, I swear I'm gon' catch em'
But maybe I'm trippin' like Scarface
My mind's playing tricks on me homie
When it rains, shit, I just wanna know where Do' is
Is he safe, warm and out the elements?
Mommy let him come home
I think a nigga done doing wrong
I get scared of the day when his soul will be gone
It's spoken words to thoughts. never been spittin' in vain
It seems the only way to sunshine is through the hard rain
I need to find a path leading to change, ask God if he feels my pain
That please won't you stop the rain

[Hook]
Please stop the rain
Ask God if he feels my pain
Please stop the rain
Please stop the rain
Ask God if he feels my pain
Please stop the rain

[Verse 2]
Grey clouds started forming
Gathered around my father's homecoming
When his soul on this earth was summoned
I remember a white church
And my lips had a salty taste
From the tears runnin' down my face
Can't erase the hurt
Watchin' my father's body lowered in dirt
My uncle and cousin passed too
What's life worth?
If it rained sometimes I would just sit there and cry
At recess, didn't wanna play
I just wished I would die
Things rushed through my head back when I was eleven
Praying and hoping that my dad had made it to heaven
It was hard being the youngest
And no one helped me
Everybody seemed happy
And no one felt me
But regardless of the fact
I did the best that I can
Making the transition from boy straight to a grown man
But understand, I felt the shame
And I feel the same, that God just needs
To stop the rain

[Hook:]
Please stop the rain
Ask God if he feels my pain
Please stop the rain
Please stop the rain
Ask God if he feels my pain
Please stop the rain

[Verse 3]
Back then I was young
Now I'm grown here to fend on my own
I'm speaking and bringing the truth through this lyrical poem
And it's hard cause these niggas can't see
Open up your eyes you can recognize me
I felt the rain like every other nigga did
Nigga always slip and stand up so I slid
It's part of the life while every thing seems trife
And everything wrong very well may be right
It's just confusing and some people can't handle
Their mind breaks down, and their hearts start to dismantle
But I'm that boy to use the hand of evil dreams
God realize that this life is way more then it seems
It's just something you learn on the daily as your mind matures
Can't ruin the life with a heart so pure
And since I realize that things won't change
God you can keep with the same
Cause Im'a just deal with the rain

[Hook:]
Im'a deal with the rain
Tell God just to leave it the same
Im'a deal with the rain (x4)

{Outro}
Rainy days
Okay, why's that?
Yeah in Cleveland, it rains
Not all the time but
To a kid who wants to go out and play
It seems like it rains every day
Kids expect it to rain sometimes but
For one kid it rained too much

[Verse 1]
Without his body
Naked and bare
Quiet and obviously not there
I am that naked thing swimming in air
Why does that mean anything?
Why do you stare?

[Chorus 1]
Lean on your table
Ask what you want of me
I am unable
Cry with me, cry with me

[Verse 2]
Within this body
Confuse
Confuse my home for a refuge
I don't want to be scared of (I don't want to be scared of)
Anybody coming in (Anybody coming in)
I don't want to lock my door anymore

[Chorus 2]
Hand me that cable
Plug into anything
I am unstable
Rock and sing‚ rock and sing

[Verse 1]
What a fool, familiar dream
I wake up laughing and running
From the boy crying and calling
'Cause the toy in my hand is real

[Verse 2]
What a tomb we're building here
In the sphere, that's where we all die
In the eye, that's where I'm living
The toy in my hand is real

[Verse 3]
In the room, her warm hands play
On my breast, what is she singing?
The form ringing and ringing
'Cause the toy in my hand is real
The toy in my hand is real

[Verse 4]
Charcoal womb, the jet planes purr
And the croon, distant as paper
Children burn, faceless vapor
'Cause the toy in my hand is real
Yes, the toy in my hand is real

[Verse 1]
You somehow let me down
Both hands and a gentleman
You could not take me through
New plans or tell me who
New friends, I can make some too
I know
You somehow took me in
Both arms, my marked up skin
Two hands, places you had been
I needed

[Chorus]
And the more that we try
To figure through the answers
To repeat ourselves
To deny, deny

[Verse 2]
Now you call my bluff
All clear and it gets so rough
Stone-faced in the light
The air and the jagged bite
Cold air, the wisdom of the night
Between us

[Chorus]
And the more that we try
To figure through the answers
To repeat ourselves
To deny, deny
To deny, deny, deny

[Verse 3]
Somehow we exist
In the folds, and now we'll kiss
Both hands, the mystery before us
She's reaching
But I could not take you through
New plans, or tell you who
New friends, you can make some too
I know

[Verse 1]
Dropped call, mid fall
Only you can know for now
Island, demons
Only you can hold them down

[Chorus]
Those girls might hear me crying
The one, the only jealousy I have is dying
With all along, your arms around me
Try

[Verse 2]
Island, demons
Zoë, you come over now
'Cause those girls keep telling me things
And only you can hold them down

[Chorus]
Those girls might hear me crying
The one, the only jealousy I have is dying
With all along, your arms around me
Try

[Chorus]
Those girls might hear me cry
The one, the only jealousy I have is dying
With all along, your arms around me
Try
Hello to the morning moon
Woke up as you left the room
Pillow still warm
Scent like meadow grass

Has the feeling come to pass?
Has the feeling come to stay?
What can we say?
Wishing you would hang around

Living on the waterfront
Witnessing the gameless hunt
Mermaids don't kill
That's the way they sing so fine

Now your lips are on the line
Now there is a broken tongue
Met you so young
Felt so frozen

How you seem to follow through
On everything you yearn for
Steps so fair
So much certainty
Now as far as we can see
The water's getting deeper
My safekeeper
The wolf is howling for me

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

When she holds me in her jaw
All my blood dripping
Will I be free
To cease gripping?

Finally laying on the ground
Open hands empty
I'll return back again
If she'll let me

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Move along through Santa Fe
And  make a new beginning
What's  that you were starting to say?
Or have you forgotten?

[Chorus]
'Cause, 'cause the unlit moon would rather hide
Be  replaced by the mystery of the stars
Because  in your room, we gather
To be replaced by the mystery of the heart

[Verse 2]
Pull  on your new wool coat
Try to remember the words you once wrote
The canyons that catch in your throat
The fault lines that carry and cradle the river

[Chorus]
'Cause,  'cause the unlit moon would rather hide
And be replaced by the mystery of the stars
Because in your room, we gather
To be replaced by the mystery of the heart (Go on, now)

[Chorus]
Because, because the unlit moon would rather hide
Be replaced by the mystery of the stars
Because in your room, we gather
To be replaced by the mystery of the heart
To be replaced by the mystery
Please cut my hair
Take  me to the kitchen
What  are the chances you have a scissor?
Maybe a pair?
It's longer than I can even bear

You  wanna be alone
Use  your ammunition to empty your arm
You ask me to leave you, I won't
Not  while the knife is at your throat

Annie reminds me
The diamond mines are burning
I push her around
But  she keeps returning

Teeth drool and bared
Make a clean incision, hold me for ransom
Tell me I'm pretty, tell me I'm rare
Talk to the boy in me, he's there
We do-si-do
Swaying in the kitchen, rocking slowly
Tell him to sound the alarm
Is he gonna keep me safe from harm?

Annie reminds me
The diamond mines are burning
I push her around
But she keeps returning

[Verse 1]
Hey brother
There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey sister
Know the lie is sweet but blood is thicker 

[?]

Oh, when the lie is heart on my sleeve, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

What if I'm far from home?
Oh, brother, I will hear you call
What if I lose all?
Oh, brother, I will help you out
When the lie is hard on my sleeve for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

Hey brother
There's an endless road to re-discover
Hey sister
Know the lie is sweet but blood is thicker

Oh, when the lie is heart on my sleeve for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Trey Songz: Verse 1]
All I got is 5, 10 20's in my pocket
I'm giving 5, 10, 20 when she drop it
Yo nigga crazy when she tell me how she want it
And she says uh huh uh huh and I'm on it
Baby made it clap like a crowd right after my show
Then she spread it open and showed me some more
Then she made it drop till her booty hit the floor
Baby grab your coat, let's go, let's go (come on)
Aye oh, (all my niggas say), aye oh, (uh huh, now all my thugs say) aye oh

Uh huh (make it bounce)
Uh huh (drop it low)
Uh huh (stick it out)
Uh huh (bring it back)
Uh huh (style its fat)
You can get it if your with it let me hear you say uh huh

[Bridge]
All the shorty's in the club
If you got a fat back
Want you to drop it, want you to shake it
Want you to hurt somebody but don't break it

[Trey Songz: Verse 2]
She be getting down down dirty in the club boy
She shake that ass that's her way of showin love boy
She done with you she'll be leaving with a thug boy  (that's the truth)
She the truth, an addiction like a drug boy
Baby made it clap like a crowd right after my show
Then she spread it open and showed me some more
Then she made it drop till her booty hit the floor
You can get it if your with it let me hear you say

[Chorus]
Uh huh (shake yo ass)
Uh huh (make it bounce)
Uh huh (drop it low)
Uh huh (stick it out)
Uh huh (bring it back)

Uh huh (make it bounce)
Uh huh (drop it low)
Uh huh (stick it out)
Uh huh (bring it back)
Uh huh (d its fat)
You can get it if your with it let me hear you say
Aye oh, aye oh, aye oh, aye oh

[T.I: Verse 1]
I came in the club chain hanging to my waist line
Lookin for the dames who lookin to have a great time
Young pimpin play no games and I don't waste time
Say super clean 2 steppin to the base line
I'm in the v.i.p. with 50 freaks Holla A-town
All fat from the waist down with their face down
Pass around shots of patron they feelin great now
They loose off a bottle of goose all I can say now
Is love to see you do your thang bend it over drop it low
Your bottoms got your booty bust it  open like a (?)
Forget me boo for askin this but answer cuz I gotta know
Whatcha doin after this the phantom right outside the door
The mansion is emmaculate its worth a couple mill or more
The scenery is fabulous can't tell me if you don't wanna go
Ask around shawty, every broad in the city know
Its real, TIP live like a TIP drill video

[Chorus]
Let me her ya say
Uh huh (shake yo ass)
Uh huh (make it bounce)
Uh huh (drop it low)

Uh huh (bring it back)

Uh huh (bring it back)
Uh huh (d its fat)
You can get it if your with it let me hear you say

[Intro]
Well, you're caught, motherfucker
Went to the studio, they said you weren't there all day
Still continue to lie
I don't know why I'm fuckin' worried about it, you know what I'm saying?
But I fucked up
Don't fucking come looking for me and shit
If you're just gonna fuckin' lie to me
I don't understand what's going through your head
You wanna be with other bitches, go be with other bitches
You don't need to be with me, the fuck?
Leave me the fuck alone

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Seems like wintertime in June
After all we've been through
Seems dark, it's only noon
All of our ups and down, we've changed
Girl, I love you, ooh, forever
I can't stand you, stand you never

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg & Nate Dogg]
Girl, I just wanna lay and chill wit'chu
You're more than a summer fling and I was wondering
Can we go back to makin' love
The way we did when I was fresh out?

[Pre-Chorus: Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
Ooh, baby
Now you got a nigga stressed out
I just wanted to be cool

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Girl, you say I just wanna hang out with my crew
But, girl, you know I'm hustlin' to bring you everything
But you act like it ain't enough
I gave a fuck but now I'm fresh out

[Pre-Chorus: Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
Ooh, baby
Now you got a nigga stressed out
I just wanted to be cool

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Seems like wintertime in June (Seems like)
After all we've been through
Seems dark, it's only noon
All of our ups and down, we've changed
Girl, I love you, ooh, forever
I can't stand you, stand you never

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg & Nate Dogg]
Wintertime with my baby
It's cold, bring that thang close to me like we're supposed to be
Can we go back to makin' love?
But ain't no condom left, I'm fresh out (Ooh, baby)
We can have a baby and figure the rest out
I just need you to be cool

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Seems like wintertime in June (Wintertime)
After all we've been through
Seems dark, it's only noon (Dark before it's noon)
All of our ups and down, we've changed
Girl, I love you, ooh, forever
I can't stand you, stand you never

[Outro: Snoop Dogg & Nate Dogg]
Wintertime (It will change)
With my baby (Feelings change)
Wintertime in June

[Intro]
I hate when a motherfucker come talkin' to me about some shit that I ain't tryna hear. Tellin' me how to do my shit.
"You need do this, you need to do that"
What the fuck is you talkin' about?
I been doin' this shit my way since I started this shit.
The way I did this shit got my bank account to where it is.
The way I did this shit got me to where the fuck I'm at.
So I ain't tryna hear none of that shit you talkin' about.
Don't tell me shit.

[Chorus]
Nigga, what you talkin' 'bout?
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you somethin'
It's everybody's favorite crip cousin, Snoop Dogg
Inductin' these woop hoes as loopholes
Death rowin' them blue drawers, bitch niggas
Good on both sides like switch hitters
Snitches get stitches, send cliques to get niggas
For you to smoke with me cuz, you need 6 figures
Ask your bitch 'bout the dick, yeah, my shit glitter

[Chorus]
Nigga, what you talkin' 'bout? (Huh?)
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?

[Verse 2]
'Cause I done changed so many lives with my vibe
Made sure my crips and my wroos all survive
Long Beach throwin' up C's in my stores
Hollywood store, Twin Towers with the boys, nigga
Switchin' bitches like I switch cars
Lil' homies on go, and keep the licks for us
Walkin' in the church, smellin' like a lit forrest
We still good 'cause a real one kept the shit goin'

[Chorus]
Nigga, what you talkin' 'bout? (What?)
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?

[Interlude]
It don't stop, it don't stop
(Makin' this shit)
We gon let this shit breathe right here, hold up

[Verse 3]
I done made so much money, everybody gotta love me
But that comes with the game, my nigga, hate it or love it
So what we really talkin' 'bout, if we ain't talkin' 'bout
What I'm talkin' 'bout
'Cause what I'm talkin' 'bout got niggas hella bags
Sophisticated crippin' with the ghetto swag
Three-piece suit with a black and a yellow rag, tied in a knot
Rollin' down the Laundro got my eyes on the opps
Got my eyes on the cops, got my eyes on the block
Fresh off stage, rich or broke loco, shit don't change
Where I'm from (Long Beach)

[Chorus]
Nigga, what you talkin' 'bout? (What?)
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?

[Outro]
Fuck outta my face with that shit, man

[Intro]
I would like to say to this gentleman and all other people who are not blessed with melanin at this point in time to understand that what has happened in our history is that you have been misinformed as much as we have been misinformed.
Much of the information that is brought forth, not only from Doctor Mohammed, but other areas, other scholars, are not available to you as a sister said in your curriculum that you've had for 400 years when you did not allow us to read and write, it was being hidden.
Whether you, sir, personally did that or not, it was a legacy that was passed onto you.
And I end by saying the Holocaust is simply the greatest atrocity on film.
Ours was not filmed.

[Chorus: Slick Rick]
(Get up, stand up) No apology, equality
(Stand up for your rights) Youth is future, let's move forward
(Get up, stand up) Healthy mentality helps sanity
(Stand up for your rights) Melting Pot, help us up, vote or not
(Get up, stand up) Facts half backwards and inaccurate
(Stand up for your rights) Tell folks no backin' up, track it up
(Get up, stand up) Good over evil, deceitful
(Don't give up the fight) Morals, principles, it's simple, son

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg & Slick Rick]
What will it take for my peoples to connect together?
You know it's black excellence if we compete together
Picture a photograph of black folks lit together
In high definition, in high, I would never
Turn my back on the block, I got the block on my back
Like James Brown, boy, I'm proud to be black
To all my sisters, Mother Earth has birthed us
Lurchers, it hurts us first, less heard this
To all my sisters, ain't no knockin' you back
Politicans politickin' with a gown and a cap
The house got flavor and I like it like that
Black girl power, yeah, I'm rockin' with that
Doors is gettin' kicked down, statues is gettin' ripped down
Presidents meetin' overseas just to have a sitdown

[Pre-Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
They tryna keep us from runnin' up
I never tell you to get down, it's all about comin' up

[Chorus: Slick Rick]
(Get up, stand up) No apology, equality
(Stand up for your rights) Youth is future, lets move forward
(Get up, stand up) Healthy mentality helps sanity
(Stand up for your rights) Melting Pot, help us up, vote or not
(Get up, stand up) Facts half backwards and inaccurate
(Stand up for your rights) Tell folks no backin' up, track it up
(Get up, stand up) Good over evil, deceitful
(Don't give up the fight) Morals, principles, it's simple, son (Son)
So what are you saying?

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
The foundation was laid, y'all nation was made
Off our ancestors' back, back, back in the day
Four hundred years ago, y'all made us slaves
And you can hear it in the spirit comin' deep from the graves
Life is a maze
Smoke so much dope you in a daze
But you ain't trippin', you gettin' paid
Who do you praise? But anyways
I read a history book, but I ain't learned nothin', dawg
So I read the Bible, then the holy Quran
Went to Jamaica to acquire my knowledge
Sat with some Rastas 'til my game got polished
The gangbang extreme with malice
Trees and degrees like I'm trained for college

[Pre-Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
They tryna keep us from runnin' up
I never tell you to get down, it's all about comin' up

[Chorus: Slick Rick]
(Get up, stand up) No apology, equality
(Stand up for your rights) Youth is future, lets move forward
(Get up, stand up) Healthy mentality helps sanity

[Intro]
Top of the morning, there's just something I wanted to address real quick. You know, there's a lot of people that didn't, like, really appreciate the Unity Walk yesterday. Don't like peace and all that, and I understand. When I was out there, I didn't understand it either. They couldn't talk peace with me. They tried, and I was like, "Nigga, that's schoolyard." You can't find a home in my generation that put in more work than me. You may find one or two that put in as much as me, but you ain't gon' find none that put in more than me. And I'm here to tell you that shit was worthless, bro. When they try to peace, I don't wanna peace. Look where I'm at. This shit ain't cool, bro. Crazy part of this, you go this way to me, two steps that way, you got 60s. You go two steps this way, you got Bloods. We wait for each when we walk to trial, bro. We united in here. Nigga might not hang with a nigga every day, but we know we got each other's backs. And I don't knock y'all out there that ain't with the peace, but don't get on people that are. Some people's just tired of this shit, bro.

[Chorus]
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one

[Verse 1]
For God so loved the world he gave us a good Crip
The late, great Neighborhood Nip
Dippin' in this L.A. bullshit
'Bout as solid of youngsta as a nigga could get (Yup)
Wasn't nothin' like these thug phonies
Was always showin' love and big respect for all the Blood homies (What up)
You understood the values in the youth
Man, I swear to God, nephew, you was the truth
Damn, how could this nigga do this?
It's 'cause every neighborhood Jesus got a neighborhood Judas
Who hate to see your team ridin' rich
You see that envy and that pride, that's that green-eyed bitch
Worse than a woman scorned (Damn)
It had been better for that man if he had never been born
But Mary, don't you mourn, Martha, don't you weep
You see, your son still affected us deep
Give us the faith to take that leap

[Chorus]
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one

[Verse 2]
All it take is one, one, one brave Blood and one brave Crip
Standing up together like we did back on them slave ships
Out on high sea waves, fighting other whips
Steady hearing "Jesus saves" out of devils lips
Shackled at the hips for the color of our skin
Hundreds of us, yeah, we knew we was brothers then
But here we go again, underneath the gun
They got us thinkin' we all different when we (One)
So I'm givin' thanks to the gangstas, givin' praise to the neighbors
Damus and Pirus, y'all got the whole world amazed
Special shout out to the Hoovers for showin us how it's done
Ain't nothin' greater than when we unite as (One)
Ain't got no ulterior motives and no other agendas
Fakin' like you with us just like some puppet pretenders
We ready to end this
For every eye that still cries
It's time to realize God will rise when we tie us

[Chorus]
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one

[Outro]
One Blood, one cuz, yeah
One Blood, one cuz
Now put them all together, you have one, one, one
One Blood, one cuz
Motherhood, brotherhood, ain't no other hood
Just imagine if we all was one hood
Now put them all together, you got one

[Chorus]
The alphabet boys wanna prosecute him
The homies in the hood say they wanna shoot him
He came in hard, but a little fruity
Walked off soft, you's a new booty
Walked off soft, he's a new booty
When you hit the yard, you's a new booty
You better have some guards, you a new booty
Pull your pants up, young loc, 'cause you some new booty

[Verse 1]
I done seen niggas hit the yard, gangbang rookie
When he came home, he was soft as a cookie
It's rules to this shit, it's in the gangbang booklet
From Long Beach to Brooklyn, you better have a look in
Nigga, be careful of what you do and what you say
And make sure your niggas is A-OK
A1 from day one, I don't have to wonder
You see, I came up in the hood so the hood'll never take me under

[Chorus]

You see, I don't have to wonder
You see, I came up in the hood so the hood'll never take me under

The alphabet boys wanna prosecute him
The homies in the hood say they wanna shoot him

Barbecue picnic, chicken, nigga, you the cookout
But me, I don't have to wonder
You see, I came up in the hood so the hood'll never take me under

[Chorus]
The alphabet boys wanna prosecute him
The homies in the hood say they wanna shoot him

Okay
This KK got me feelin' cray-cray
I just got a pound and I smoked it all the same day
This cookie got me feelin' like a rookie
I just took three puffs, got super high, that's how it should be
This purple got me in a circle
Better slow it down before you hit it, it'll hurt you
This lemon got me feelin' finished
I won't ever stop, been blowin' smoke since the beginnin'
Ya' feel me?

[Chorus: Russ & Wiz Khalifa]
I said this kush is gonna take me away (Yup), 'way (Let's go), away (Let's go)

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
From the LBC shore, wheels up on the G4
Louis bag with the Gucci loafs, silk shirt with a mink coat
Flying in, selling game to all you hoes and you're buying in
Legend in your presence, hiding
Got a room full of bitches and they lying there
High in there, ain't no fire, but a lot of wine in there
They get it, ain't no WiFi
On the low, close the door, bitch, I Spy
See when I pull up, jump in, we slip out
Roll up, roll out, get mines, dip out
She had to come and give a real Crip a taste
Out of pocket, never that stayin' in stripper's place
Big brown ass with some fat titties
And baby make magic when I'm in the city

[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri]
Every time I come to town (Uh)

Belaire champagne, we don't drink out the glasses (No)
Time is money baby, so I quibble over semantics (Word)
Ace card good, but my license invalid (Word)
She gon' throw it back, but it ain't for the challenge (Throw it back)
I just seen Snoop park the Wraith at the valley (Wraith)
And we with crazy girls, so the girls gotta be 'bout it (Let's go)
From the zip to the LBC, we make the girls get W-E-T
I see you, I know you see me
Can I get sloppy in the foreign two seater? (Skrt)
Yeah, mami, call me, "Big papi" (Big Papi)
Chop a nigga, don't speak 'cause I'm rich and groovy
Got hits like Rudy, make a bitch whistle me
Tequila got me loopy, Russ pack, fruity (Nigga)

[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri]
Every time I come to town (Uh)

Big dog, you could never short me (What?)

Since a lil' nigga, Dogg got it crackin'
On  deck all times, no lacking
Head on swivel 'cause anything can happen
I was banging before I was rapping (Rapping)
I was slanging before it was trapping (Trapping)
Always on go, it's automatic
Gold medal caught my eye, I gotta have it
We lost Nip too soon, that's tragic
But he gave LA more wins than Magic
More wins than Kobe and Shaq did
Champions never die, they everlasting

A lot of niggas not caught from this cloth
You are witnessing a gangster evolve
After all the run-ins with the law (What?)
After life threw me all them curveballs (Curveballs)
You'da thought I gave up, but nah (Nah)
Grow man, thug it out, stand tall
Who sold millions of records and balled?
Never slowed up, no no, not at all
From the streets of Long Beach, it's the Dogg
I hustled every day, how you think I got it all?
Did it my way, I done broke a lot of laws
Always came in first place, I ain't never tied with y'all
Everything real, I ain't never lied to y'all
First place (First place)

[Chorus: Tdot illdude]
Convertibles and Cuban links just like a prize
I gotta win, the golden medal caught my eye (First place)

Focus on me
Baby, can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?
Focus on me

[Verse 1]
So much smoke in the air, you can't see shit
Servin' Crip dick 'til the bitch sea sick
Bought everything, I don't lease shit, G shit
Workin' out so the fleece fit, cool
I'm on that who-you-wanna-be shit
West to East shit for all my dawgs and my Heathcliffs
Streets on tax so the heat's on my lap
When it's war, fuck the law, fuck it, bury me strapped
Money long as 21 Cadillacs
Matter fact, get it scratched like BattleCat
Hood politics, every real nigga battles that
Still standin' 'cause the way a nigga handled that
10 toes down, never actin' like a mark
Only nigga with a star that got put on at the Park, nigga
That's on the set, that's on my mama
I could still pull up at the Park, nigga

[Chorus]
Focus on me
On God, I did that, I did that
Focus on me
10 toes, I did that, I did that
Focus on me
Every word I rapped, nigga, I lived that
Focus on me
Give it up, I did that, I did that

[Verse 2]
Gangbangers rejoice when they hear my voice
Pullin' up in Rolls Royce, the hood in full-force still
Realizing I'm the source still
The wrong move could get my boys killed
So I focus on me
Makin' sure this whole shit stay rollin'
And my baby boo neck stay frozen
Rich rollin', on the clock, non-stop
And my bank account sure shows it
Big mouth Crip and the bitch niggas can't close it
I was chosen
So don't worry 'bout mine, nigga, we good
And fuck what y'all think, "Free Suge"
Diamond in the back with the leather with the wood in it
Banged around the world, made sure I kept the hood in it
Yeah, one time for the king
And I still smoke a nigga like a big bag of weed
On moms

[Chorus]
Focus on me
On God, I did that, I did that
Focus on me
10 toes, I did that, I did that
Focus on me
Every word I rapped, nigga, I lived that
Focus on me
Give it up, I did that, I did that

Oh yeah, it's 6 AM where I'm at

In it to win it, get it crackin', now how ya doin'?
Maneuverin' while we movin'
Smoky in this motherfucker while we crusin'
We off the coast of France with a host of friends
Coastal winds get close again, you the most advanced

Do what I say and walk it out and pay attention
Don't you give it away
And once we make that clear
I'ma tell you what you wanna hear, yeah

Got in that mad shit 'cause I'm rich and handsome
Diamonds on me dancin', yeah (Oh yeah)
Smokin' on exotics, say she from the Tropics
It look like she brought it, don't care though
Fuckin' fix the stitches in her hair though
Fuck yo last nigga, I know you used to the middle

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
Baby, don't deny what you here for
Wetter than the dimes on my earlobes
Lookin' in my eyes like it's tenfold (Tenfold)
Wanna knock boots like Timbo's
All up in your water, I'm so nautical with it (Ayy)
I see what I want and I gotta go get it (Ayy)
Once we get goin', I won't stop 'til you finish
But the main i-, but the main idea

Hello?

[Chorus: Rick Rock]
On  my main phone, textin' with this other phone
Tryna  keep these lights on, sleepin' with my Nikes on
Doin' hella shit, bustin' patterns in a random

Tryna  keep these lights on, sleepin' with my Nikes on
Doin' hella shit, bustin' patterns in a random

[Verse 1]
I'm on a road to the riches, checkin' paper, mane (Paper, mane)
I wanna play in gold like a Laker, mane (Laker, mane)
My bitch too negative, gotta shake her, mane (Shake her, mane)
She  gotta catch me in the wind like a paper plane
I came up in the '80s when the women were defensive
So I came up with a counter called passive-aggressive pimpin'
When you make 'em feel lucky for fuckin' me in the loft
Help 'em bust nuts and they helpin' me buy trucks
Not outright, but a nice down in the first month
I mean, I'm not really pimpin', my nigga, fuck you on?
Beats slappin', 9 milli' packin'-ass nigga
Oh, soon Slew City Slew mackin'-ass nigga
I am spit-taking llama
'Bout my decimals, digits, commas
Rubles, shillings, pesos, watch out
Because punk shit lead to trauma
That's why I'm on my

Main phone, textin' with this other phone
Tryna keep these lights on, sleepin' with my Nikes on

Tryna keep these lights on, sleepin' with my Nikes on
Doin' hella shit, bustin' patterns in a random
Watch my paper get longer (Rock it)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Nike Cortez on my feet in a deep sleep with a freak
From the meet and greet, now it's left to me
Rick bounced the beat, gave a ounce to P
Had to cut the bitch off for popping off to me
I'm back to business relentlessly, I ain't done 'til I'm finished
Variety in your society and bitch, I'm the menace
You wish I would call back, you wish I would fall back
See, I'm a dope boy, so I'm a need my football back
In and out these routes like I was Julian Edelman
I needs all mine from the shit I been peddling
I'm settling for nothing less than the top notch
Jumping over all you hoes like hopscotch
Bitch, back up off me and leave me alone
I'm walking my dog a half a mile from my home
On my phone, tryna get rich, talking shit to a bitch
Coming up with some shit like this

[Chorus: Rick Rock]
On my main phone, textin' with this other phone
Tryna keep these lights on, sleepin' with my Nikes on
Doin' hella shit, bustin' patterns in a random
Watch my paper get longer

Tryna keep these lights on, sleepin' with my Nikes on
Doin' hella shit, bustin' patterns in a random
Watch my paper get longer (Rock it)

[Interlude: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, holla at me
No, I'ma text you from my other number
Yeah, it's the 818
Oh, you want me to hit you from the 213?
We find our hero, Blaps Bastardly, roaming the land
With nothing but his MPC and his moral compass in hand
Avoiding all punk shit, not needing two dollars in his hand
Weaving through the malevolent man and malevolent plan
You got to catch him

[Chorus: Rick Rock]
On my main phone, textin' with this other phone
Tryna keep these lights on, sleepin' with my Nikes on
Doin' hella shit, bustin' patterns in a random
Watch my paper get longer

You've been looking for me
I've been laying low in the shade
The sun is just what I need

[Post-Chorus: Eric Jaye & Snoop Dogg]
Everybody loves the sunshine

Summertime, pockets bulging
Something's happening and I'm indulging
Electrifying, death-defying, yeah, that's the science
Defined with no compliance but my alliance
I'm cold with it, roll with it, so go get it
Take some, bass drum, so vivid
Picture that, sunset, flowers, and trees
Hydraulics and Parliament, Impala with parlor seats
Follow the policy, this a little DP-ology
Dress code, cut-off khakis with Wallabees
Yes sir, we does the most
So I'd like to give a toast to the coast, black excellence

[Chorus: Eric Jaye & Snoop Dogg]
I've been looking for you (Let's get it)
You've been looking for me (I gotta get it)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
The feeling is fine once you fill in the line
Ain't no blank spots, just all go tank tops
I'm realer than real and my word is my bond
Pop a bottle of Don and blow a blunt with LeBron
I'm on my way to the tip, ain't no cookies and milk
Just satin and silk, I look for my quill
We writing the script, flipping the shit like a flapjack
Boss lady, that's my queen, blackjack
21, get it done, we having fun
Make dough, legs show, let's make a run
Real talk, boss dog, you are the one
The star, the light, and the sun

[Bridge: Eric Jaye]
Just bees and things and flowers

Ayy,  it's too many to choose from, I can't pick (Ayy)
I  grab two, we dip out and take pics (Yeah)
New car and I lose calm, my favorite (Ayy)
Poolside, I skinny dip with gay chicks
Nah,  I don't usually be the one that amaze, man

Part of my ventilation (Ooh, ah)
Part  of my ventilation (Ooh, ah)
It's part of my ventilation

Groupies hit my phone, they just tryna lick the lollipop
I'm  too cold, but I'm the type to make your body hot
Feel like Keith Sweat, feel like Jodeci
I need the winner's club, hope my ex don't notice me
Can't save hoes, I just move to the next one
Nonchalant ass, I could tell I just upset some
Sick cup, big yup, treat 'em like my stepson
Colora-rado make me have to come and flex some
I be moving militant, yo' bitch be moving sideways
I be getting paid shows, vacay on the holidays
You be with them lame niggas, I be on the finer things
Two step my way to a bag, get up out my way

[Chorus: RJMrLA]
Ayy, it's too many to choose from, I can't pick (Ayy)

Take a deep breath, now what you tryna do?
Doggy Dogg with the shit, but I'm not a fool
When I step up in the party, hoes know the rule
And if the bitch can't swim, sit by the pool
Light up a Backwood, I'm back, hood
What's cracking? I keep a bad bitch with me, that's how I do it
Caked up like it's my birthday, nigga, feeling good
Then blow out the candles and wish a nigga would
Fuck around with the reason your ho stuck around
Niggas wanna act funny, I got a bunch of clowns
I make money to play with, to stay rich
Hoes wanna label the nigga, but say, hey bitch

[Chorus: RJMrLA]
Ayy, it's too many to choose from, I can't pick (Ayy)
I grab two, we dip out and take pics (Yeah)
New car and I lose calm, my favorite (Ayy)
Poolside, I skinny dip with gay chicks
Nah, I don't usually be the one that amaze, man
I do this all the time, it's part of my ventilation (Ooh, ah)
Part of my ventilation (Ooh, ah)
Part of my ventilation (Ooh, ah)
It's part of my ventilation
I do this all the time, it's part of my ventilation

[Verse 3: $tupid Young]
$tupid Young, uh
Hold up, nigga, let me ventilate
Nigga say he run the building, well, it's time to renovate
Forever paid, nigga, I can never hate
Never catch me lacking even when I'm in a Escalade
Pull up with them extra clips like a movie
Lil baby bad, tell her bust it like a Uzi
Fucking with the gang, but I'm knowing she a groupie
Tell her no pics and videos, she fuck around and sue me
Young Asian hood nigga from the ES
Ray Charles, man, I think they can't see us
Ah shit, and these diamonds on me VS
Niggas hating on the gang 'cause they can't be us

[Chorus: RJMrLA]
Ayy, it's too many to choose from, I can't pick (Ayy)
I grab two, we dip out and take pics (Yeah)
New car and I lose calm, my favorite (Ayy)
Poolside, I skinny dip with gay chicks
Nah, I don't usually be the one that amaze, man
I do this all the time, it's part of my ventilation (Ooh, ah)
Part of my ventilation (Ooh, ah)
Part of my ventilation (Ooh, ah)
It's part of my ventilation
I do this all the time, it's part of my ventilation

And I can smell bullshit about a mile away
Old bullshit-ass nigga, let it go
Or a bunch of bullshit is what you headed fo'

[Stanza 1]
Perfect petals punctuate the fabrics yellow blue
silver platters with strawberries strewn across the room

[Stanza 2]
In Zimmerman with sandals on one summer dress to choose

[Stanza 3]
Three girls
eyes rolled
loud laughter
dust specs lit by afternoon

[Stanza 4]
My life is sweet like lemonade now there's no bitter fruit
eternal sunshine of the spotless mind
no thought of you

[Stanza 5]
My thoughts have changed
my voice is higher
now I'm over you

[Stanza 6]
No flickering in my head movies
projected in Bellevue

[Stanza 7]
Because I captured the mood of my wish fulfilled
and sailed to Xanadu

[Stanza 8]
The grief that came in waves that rolled I navigated through

[Stanza 9]
The fire from my wish as wind to future trip to Malibu

[Stanza 10]
now everything I have is perfect
nothing much to do

[Stanza 11]
just perfect florals
green embroidered chairs
one dress to choose

[Intro: Shake]
Yeah (Woo!)
Shake
070
Yeah

[Chorus: Shake]
Don't get satisfied
Livin' the same old life
Don't let a movement die
We just want it all
In a new day
With a new thing
With a mean words
With a new lang
I don't want everything new
In the street new new new new (Yeah)
In my town new new new new
What about you?

[Verse 1: Shake]
I'm always in town with my homie loitering
Until I figured out I had no more tolerance
For the life, at the world, got a bottle
Mama's havin' lot of trouble paying for the rent
So I told her this
In the new day, no more strugglin'
In the new days, I'll accomplish shit
I messed around before but now I'm serious
That's it
I'm in the game, never gonna quit
That's it
If you want a lot of things, get rich
That's it

[Chorus: Shake]
New day
With a new thing
With a mean words
With a new lang
I don't want everything new new new new
In the street new new new new (Yeah)
In my town new new new new
What about you?
Yeah
Don't get satisfied
Livin' the same old life

[Vado]
Yo
'Bout time I set the bar high
Gold watch
Gold

Cooked rocks
Pot's my only hard times
Cold flow
Sniffing these hard lines
Smoke weed by the

Over the casket where your mom cries
Fresh dressed the model
The Ski E A 

[?] gortex and goggles
After that, I ate
Next step's 

[?]
Who's in the A?
I'm probably the boy who busts checks with Pablo
I'm done speaking
War, I'm gun reaching
Wipe his blood off the floor then come bleach it
When I stood aside the store, I slung pieces
Dumb sneakers, 2Chainz a hoe, Jesus
Some hate it, but some think it
Drug king could just hit me with some recent
Say "Dude nice" I'm like "Your son decent"
Got a few bars, to me that's some precent
Why talk?
Yes I walk
They made for the street, one deep, my slime fought

[?]
Your chick told me you cheap, that's my fault
Shit, what I sport? 8 series, I sport
If you go get it, the rest just roll with it
Used to sit in front of the building like old tenants
Never made a sale in person, that's so different
This chicken, put you in the box with no biscuit

[Outro: Shake]
Don't get satisfied
Livin' the same old life
Don't let a movement die
We just want it all
In a new day
With a new thing
With a mean words
With a new lang
I don't want everything new
In the street new new new new (Yeah)
In my town new new new new
What about you?

[Hook]
This for them real go-getters, real mic spitters
Real head spinners, you know what this is
This for the people now to get up, the mainstream’s a setup
I know that you fed up, you know what this is

[Verse]
Parked by the seashore, I’ma see more
Believe now, when we tour, I’ma be raw
This another project, I’ma drop three more
Got the crowd going up and down like a seesaw
Entrepreneur, I can never be poor
When you enter the cypher, dude, you better be sure
Or take a detour, I’m down by the law
Consistently working like one, two, three, four
So give me some room, I’m above your average
When I see you and your man, I’m thinking same sex marriage
You talk coke, but KRS is dope
You’re like a bitch and a biter so I call you Ms. Quote
You’re about to get smoked, you’re fake and you’re broke
Your mixtape’s a joke
You wanna hang? Here’s the rope
I spit the lethal, that’s the issue
‘cause I will split you where I broke the piece, our love’s gonna get you
People still asking, “Is KRS still dope?”
If your body’s full of holes, don’t the frame still float?
Watch how I eat you, you ain’t a legend
You’re just ordinary people
I’m the original story, you’re the sequel
I’m the dirty version, you clean, man, they bleep you
I stay the classic section, nobody needs you
I write the books of knowledge, nobody reads you
You got it twisted, homie, we not equal
I’m the whole motion picture, you’re the preview
I’m that boom bap, you’re the dee-do dee-do dee-do
Soft as Saran Wrap, man, I see through
I’m only trying to free you, but you’re too busy tryna be illegal
You don’t even know what real Gs do
Why don’t you just be you and build that?
With no drugs or money in your rap, now where your skills at?
North, south, east and west of it, I’m the best of it
You wanna know my name? KRS is it, One is the rest of it
You can see with emceeing I’m blessed with it

[Hook]
This for them real go-getters, real mic spitters
Real head spinners, you know what this is
This for the people now to get up, the mainstream’s a setup
I know that you fed up, you know what this is

This for them real go-getters, real mic spitters
Real head spinners, you know what this is
This for the people now to get up, the mainstream’s a setup
I know that you fed up, you know what this is

[Verse 1]
Let me introduce myself properly
I am the original, I’m read‚ it’s not a lot of me
Knowledge reigns supreme‚ that’s the vibration I’m coming with
People ask me‚ “What you think about rap?” Well it’s some other shit, but
This style’s exposing the corruption of the government
This ain’t every rapper’s style, KRS some other shit
For years we teach the people ‘bout knowledge from the pavement
Street knowledge‚ a complete college, we called it edutainment
Education through entertainment, that’s what we named it
But corporations of all sorts wanted mass enslavement
Program directors got the music but didn’t play it
They knew about the movement but they still chose to betray it
So ask yourself‚ why the radio just play the same shit?
They part of the conspiracy, we gon’ have to face it
All types of emcees spitting out the illest rhymes
And we only get to hear five rappers a millions times?

[Chorus]
You’s a millionaire, yeah, off of black despair, yeah
You’s a millionaire, yeah, off of lust and fear, yeah
You’s a millionaire, yeah, off the poor right there, yeah
You’s a millionaire, yeah, you’s a millionaire, yeah

[Verse 2]
You’s a millionaire with a million there and a million here
You got a million shares
Shoes, you got a million pair
You do what you do, you don’t even care
Let ‘em peep and stare
They not even there
You in your easy chair, the millionaire
Your fragrance fills the air
Which costs more than they’ll make in a year
But you don’t even care
Hit the brakes, red lights in the rear
The pastor anoints them
While poor people appoint them
Driven by envy, they don’t see how the rich people exploit them

[Chorus]
You’s a millionaire, yeah, off of black despair, yeah
You’s a millionaire, yeah, off of lust and fear, yeah
You’s a millionaire, yeah, off the poor right there, yeah
You’s a millionaire, yeah, you’s a millionaire, yeah

[Verse 3]
I can be a millionaire
A millionaire for sure
If I hoard my money and ignore the cries of the poor
If I opened up a company and asked for hood loyalty
Then when the money came in, I would not pay out the royalties
I would be a millionaire
Maybe I would love it
But what they do with a thousand dollars, I can do with a hundred
I don’t cost that much to live
So I got a lot to give
Keep a surplus, positive

[Chorus]
You’s a millionaire, yeah, off of black despair, yeah
You’s a millionaire, yeah, off of lust and fear, yeah
You’s a millionaire, yeah, off the poor right there, yeah
You’s a millionaire, yeah, you’s a millionaire, yeah

(fresh)
The real hip-hop is (fresh) x8

[Verse 1]
Bass, treble, c’mon, look around, man
The thump, the level, all that’s the sound man
When the boom bap dumps hard on the ground, man
It’s a good sound, man, that’s never caught pounding
Fingers on levels, eyes on the session
Pump the bass bottom, give me more of that compression
Sound engineer it, you’ve got to have the ear and
You’ve got to know what you hear, never overbearing
You bring the sound blaring hot like you ain’t caring
The level’s in the red, but no, you ain’t staring
You pushing more bottom, you make the sound crack
Like the snare going “blap” on a boom boom bap
Sound man, I hear you, better yet, I see you
Yeah man, you free to adjust the EQ
Pump up the reverb, mess with the delay
Gimme more 

[?] and turn up the DJ

[Refrain]
The real hip-hop is
The real hip-hop is (fresh) x3

[Verse 2]
From the time I come out, I do a line check
I spit a freestyle to get you in the right mind set
It ain’t time yet to spit a rhyme yet
My right frequency the sound man he didn’t find yet
So while he searching for it, I’ll keep on working on it
We want that big sound before they close the curtain on it
So let’s turn it up, so let’s turn it up
Don’t be afraid, turn it up, word is up
We wanna thank the sound people that’s with me
When the music is low, they turn it up quickly
When the sounds are low, they brighten and lift me
When the feedback comes, they killin’ it swiftly
The sound can be tricky when you see me play
No computers, just a mixer and some 

[?] DJs
Never no frontin’, we showin’ all y’all something
Sound man, just keep the music bumpin’
It ain’t nothing

[Refrain]
The real hip-hop is
The real hip-hop is (fresh) x3
(fresh)

[Verse 3]
I’ma keep rapping while tours they keep happening
Got a 

[?] of rhymes for people to keep 

[?]
Boom bap beats with rhymes to keep attractin’ ‘em
That’s why the sound man gots to have rap in ‘em
Cordless, hardwire, fifty-eight mics
Wring ‘em out ‘cause all rappers don’t sound alike
I found a light, it’s at the end of the rear
It’s the sound engineer that really cares about what he hears
It’s the bass and snares, he understands the music
He’s a fan of the music, he makes plans for the music
He sets the EQ, how his hands gonna choose it
It’s not a band, but he still plans for the acoustics
This is the sound man that I be looking for
These are the dudes that I request when I’m booking tours
So if you like the sound of this brown man
Give it up for the sound man
Overstand

[Refrain]
The real hip-hop is
The real hip-hop is (fresh) x7

Give it up for the sound man
Give it up for the sound man

[Intro: Idris Elba & James Corden]
We can go driving in, on my scooter
Uh, you know, just 'round London
Oh, I'd...

[Verse 1]
I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But something happened, I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that's not where mine lives

[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
And now I love high tea, stories from Uni, and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God, I love the English

[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy, I enjoy nights in Brixton
Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you

[Bridge]
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Wanna be with you)
Wanna be with you (Oh)

[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy, I enjoy walking Soho
Drinking in the afternoon (Yeah)
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you (You)
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true (Yeah)
You know I love a London boy (Oh)
Boy (Oh), I fancy you (I fancy you, ooh)

[Outro]
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
I, I, I fancy you
Oh whoa, oh, I
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Ooh)
Wanna be with you
I fancy you (Yeah), I fancy you
Oh whoa, ah

[Verse 1]
How many days did I spend thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
Lived in the shade you were throwing
'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
And I couldn't get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
Free rent, living in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
But then something happened one magical night

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

[Verse 2]
Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
Would've been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show

[Pre-Chorus]
But you showed who you are, then one magical night

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

[Bridge]
Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
It's all just a blur

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
I did, I did, I did
It isn't hate, it's just indifference
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
So, yeah

[Verse 1]
The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayy)
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

[Verse 2]
In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayy)
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause you waited your whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)
Ah

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

[Bridge]
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
Uh huh

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Ah-ah, that's right, you're the one I want
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Ah-ah, darling, you're the one I want
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
You're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

[Outro]
You're the one I want, one I want
You're the one I want, one I want

[Intro]
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my

[Chorus]
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
’Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 1]
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, "I don't know"
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages?

[Chorus]
’Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can’t pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 2]
My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

[Chorus]
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)

[Post-Chorus]
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no

[Outro]
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, "I don't know"

[Verse 1]
We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I’d fly to you?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We’d still worship this love
We’d still worship this love

[Verse 2]
I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we’re begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you’re led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, ah

[Outro]
Still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Even if it's a false god
Still worship this love

[Verse 1]
I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
Put you in jail for something you didn’t do
I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
Thought I had reason to attack, but no

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there’s no us
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say

[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don’t wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don’t wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it’s all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

[Verse 2]
It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I lived like an island, punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It’s on your face, don't walk away, I need to say

[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
I'm sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

[Bridge]
Tell me that you're still mine
Tell me that we'll be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that it's not my fault
Tell me that I'm all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say

[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

[Intro]
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 1]
School bell rings, walk me home
Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
Lost my gloves, you give me one
"Wanna hang out?" Yeah, sounds like fun
Video games, you pass me a note
Sleeping in tents

[Chorus]
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
Light pink sky, up on the roof
Sun sinks down, no curfew
20 questions, we tell the truth
You've been stressed out lately, yeah, me too
Something gave you the nerve
To touch my hand

[Chorus]
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)

[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 3]
Church bells ring, carry me home
Rice on the ground looks like snow
Call my bluff, call you "Babe"
Have my back, yeah, every day
Feels like home, stay in bed
The whole weekend

[Chorus]
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
(Ooh)

[Chorus: IRO]
Got me straight up drinkin' from the barrel
I've been losin' hours
Singin' sad songs underneath the gallows
Runnin' from my shadow
Runnin' from my shadow

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I need relief, I need some peace
But the voices, they keep talking to me
And I keep going to meetings, I pray every evening
But I can't escape my disease
Lookin' at me, stare in the mirror
Look at the man starin' back at you
You are your failures, you are your triumphs
You are a prophet, you are an asshole
You are a devil and you are a god
You buy a shovel and bury it all
Think you can purchase your way right out of the void and not end up payin' the cost?
Lie to yourself, lie to them, hell
Whatever helps, forgotten what's real
You think the secrets you keep stay between you and me
But the shadow's attached to your heels, like

[Chorus: IRO]
Got me straight up drinkin' from the barrel
I've been losin' hours
Singin' sad songs underneath the gallows
Runnin' from my shadow
Runnin' from my shadow

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I let it rain through the sunroof
I've been parked out by the waterfront
Been going to war with myself
Reading Sun Tzu, bumpin' Tha Carter I
I'm back on day two, forgot how hard it was
Starin' at me for so long, I forgot who the target was
I thought I was over this, this isn't what sober is
What kind of dad would hold their kids
Then go back out and ignore the risk?
The shadow wants me to forget the pain
Wants me to live in the guilt and the shame
So much that I have no choice but to die from the drugs or blow out my fucking brain
The shadow, it wants me too busy
It wants me keep driftin'
It wants me to give in to fame
It wants me forgettin' that I got an illness that lives in my spirit in different ways
Shadow, the light
They can both blind, got different names
If it's too dark, if it's too bright
It can still burn you with different flames
And I don't owe them an iota
Tell my mama I'ma die sober
Yeah, I might be bipolar
I should write an album out in Wyoming
Low bottom, I'm a high roller
Go full throttle, got no chauffeur
Got two voices on both shoulders
But I keep swinging 'til the fight's over

[Chorus: IRO]
Got me straight up drinkin' from the barrel
I've been losin' hours
Singin' sad songs underneath the gallows
Runnin' from my shadow
(Runnin' from my shadow)

[Bridge: IRO]
Runnin', I'm runnin', I can't get away, away, away
Chasin' me down every night and all day, all day, all day
Runnin', I'm runnin', I can't get away, away, away
Chasin' me down every night and all day, all day
Runnin', I'm runnin', I can't get away, away, away
Chasin' me down every night and all day, all day, all day
I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I can't get away
Chasin' me down every night and all day
My mama told me I gotta be brave, be brave, be brave

[Outro: IRO]
Keep runnin' from my shadow

Swim through the living room, straight to the bedroom, lookin' for bricked dope
My papa looked at my mama, lookin' at that closet like
"There that shit go"
Two keys and a thumper, 10K with the mustard
A whole family and no buster, this don't add up
My padre facin' them three strikes
And my mama just smacked the pipe
Crack smoke got crash tight, this shit still bad, 'cause
The boys peeped a Brillo pad and some glass tucked
And it's lookin' like my parents was up in here runnin' all through that stash dumb
But the fact, crack different than coke
Plus the smoke wasn't close enough to choke me
Lowered scrutiny so mom could kick big facts for bruh
The truth is we held the bag for this kid we took in
Tryna part with his old ways, maybe we all mistook him
'Cause I knew something was fucked up when he said
"Don't open or look in this here satchel that I'll be back for in just a couple of minutes"
Then hella hours later, like do I cook dinner now or later?
Worried about cold food for a cold fool
Motherfucker put my family in danger
I blame myself, pardon my anger
I never looked inside his stuff so he never really needed to hide his stuff
When you showed me what was really inside this stuff
I never had a clue
Now I know as police, you gotta do what you gotta do
But this my family, all I got is us, my nigga
My own mother just shot at us, my nigga
This is why we here
And I don't fuck with niggas I don't know
But I had a heart to help this kid in danger, tears in anger
Gemini gettin' violently
Police silence don't help anxiety
My daddy's priors tame all of his wildin'
All of these pilots, not one of them flyin'
Y'all planning on trying?
This flight is diving, nose tucked
Po-po stuck, play your part
All this commotion and neighbors listenin' like, "Oh fuck"
Shit finna spark
All this emotion, need a decision made with some heart
'Cause ours is broken, they tryna lock the third notch on my pop's choker
This shit ain't kosher
Moms is oh for if CPS get sent them pages
I ain't gon' see my parents for ages
All this erosion, no more protection
Shit don't feel safe
What graduation? What degrees?
What dissertation? What imagination?
Imagine my whole world taken away from me
All over some bass and misconstrued melodies
My heart racin', clutchin' my red Ranger, pacin'
I can barely breathe
And mister policeman, told policeman, we got what we need
Just let 'em be

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Thank God for my bitches still sticking with me
Thank God, when I talk, I know you listen to me
Thank God that I'm built for the distance
Thank God for me, thank God for me
Thank God for my bitches still sticking with me
Thank God, when I talk, I know you listen to me
Thank God that I'm built for the distance
Thank God for me, thank God for me

[Bridge: bearface]
And if you're hurting, love yourself with my heart
And if you're hurting, love yourself with my heart

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Thank God for my bitches still sticking with me
Thank God, when I talk, I know you listen to me
Thank God that I'm built for the distance
Thank God for me, thank God for me
Thank God for my bitches still sticking with me
Thank God, when I talk, I know you listen to me
Thank God that I'm built for the distance
Thank God for me, thank God for me

[Outro: Ryan Beatty]
Thank God for me, thank God for me
Thank God for me
Thank God for me, thank God for me
Thank God for me
Oh, oh
(Nobody)

[Intro]
Immersed myself in discontent
Hopin' you can only repent these things
It smells like ginger

[Verse]
What you mean, I ain't green like Timothy?
Dead leaves in the breeze‚ sweep your chimneys
See the boy try me‚ now the boy deceased
They put the blame on me‚ but hey, it wasn't me (Boom, boom‚ boom)
Like God can't judge me, but only God can see
I ain't bein' judged, no one judgin' me
I walk on water‚ pain and torture what I bring to these
And there's a war in my head, just like the Middle East
And I'm the flurry, vision blurry, see soliloquies
I didn't get the memo, didn't CC me
Only CC me when I'm doin' burglaries
And if it weren't on TV you wouldn't have ever seen

[Chorus]
Fuck God, I'm a dog backwards
Backwards, I don't smoke Backwoods
What you sayin'? Why you prayin' for forgiveness?
When you wanna get money, get them riches
Like what you sayin'? Why you prayin' for forgiveness?
Whole lot of shit and some bitches, like
(Mmm, mmm, ha, yeah, fuck it, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Break the law, break the law
Break the law, break the law
Break the law, break the law
Break the law, break the law

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I still remember writin' words down
Tryna get them all out of my mouth
Big boy, you a big boy now
Big boy, you a big boy now
Don't pout 'round me
Don't cry around me
Don't laugh 'round me
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like my cousin
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like my cousin

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
If I had another
I'm a bad motherfucker
Got love for my mother
The city that protect me
I don't fuck with y'all like I used to though
But you could come around for the Houston baby, oh

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I still remember writin' words down
Tryna get them all out of my mouth
Big boy, you a big boy now
Big boy, you a big boy now
Don't pout 'round me
Don't cry around me
Don't laugh 'round me
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like my cousin
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like my cousin

[Verse 2: Joba]
Who the Hell am I?
Who the Hell are you?
Don't waste my time, I got shit to do
Been in love with you, don't know what to do
Still searchin' for the truth, every which way
Mental foreplay, bound by cuffs to you
Do it my way, like everything I do
Take my breath away
Don't let me fade away
May die before I wake
Not the type to play
I take, and take, and take
Never want a change
Always wanna change
Used to count my change
Everybody changed
Memories of the days
I was young at heart
Matters of the heart
Rearrange, reactions in my brain
Redefine my pain
Been wishin' I could change
Hard to change my ways
Trained a certain way
Afraid of my own fate
Just another phase

[Bridge: Joba]
Lost cause and a lost child
Lost my way tryna change for the wrong crowd
I'm weak and I'll say it proud
Built me up, pull me down, let's air it out
Patch me up, and stitch it
Make me better
Just patch me up, and stitch it
Make me better (Make me better)

[Verse 3: bearface]
What a day, what a day
I just had a dream that you took it all away (Ayy)
Blow smoke in the face
I just hope your lil' bro grow to be great (Ayy)
What a day, what a day
I just had a dream where you took it all away (Ayy)
Blow smoke in the face
One in the clip, and one in the chamber (Yeah)
We was riding in the dark, you were putting your legs up (Legs up)
Girl, I don't know, maybe I should just stay shut (Stay shut)
Did I ruin your life baby, even from day one? (Uh-uh)
If it was another life, maybe you could still save us (Ooh-ooh)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I still remember writin' words down
Tryna get them all out of my mouth
Big boy, you a big boy now
Big boy, you a big boy now
Don't pout 'round me
Don't cry around me
Don't laugh 'round me
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like my cousin
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like my cousin

[Intro]
Could you be
The most beautiful girl in the world?
(So beautiful, beautiful)
It's plain to see
You're the reason that God made a girl
(Oh, oh, oh)
Could you be?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & (Chester Bennington)]
(When this began) I had nothing to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused) And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me) But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(Nothing to lose) Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own‚ and the fault is my own

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & (Mike Shinoda)]
I wanna heal‚ I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal‚ I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & (Chester Bennington)]
And I've got nothing to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(I was confused) Looking everywhere, only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I?) What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me
(Nothing to lose) Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own‚ and the fault is my own

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & (Mike Shinoda)]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else‚ until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything 'til I break away from me
I will break away, I'll find myself today

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & (Mike Shinoda)]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I wanna heal
I wanna feel like I'm somewhere I belong
I wanna heal
I wanna feel like I'm somewhere I belong
Somewhere I belong

[Intro: Prince]
Baby, could you be the most beautiful girl in the world?

[Instrumental]

[Spoken: Mayte]
Oh God, what am I gonna do?
He finally called
What do I wear, what do I wear?
Maybe black, hmm...
Mmm, too sexy, too mysterious
Ooh, maybe the red dress
I don't know, it's too firey
He won't be able to sit still
He won't be able to eat
Mmm, what do I do, what do I do?
Maybe white, ooh, the white dress
Too pure, too virgin-like
Damn, maybe he's just gonna have to see me the way I am
Maybe I'll just wear the jeans with my holes
Hopefully he'll like me
I don't know
I hope he can accept me the way I am 'cause I'm crazy about him...

[Outro: Prince]
The most beautiful girl in the world

[Verse 2: Prince]
How can I get through days when I can't get through hours?
I can try but when I do I see you and I'm devoured, oh yes I am
Who'd allow, who'd allow a face to be soft as a flower?
I could bow and feel proud in the light of this power, oh you got it

[Pre-Chorus: Prince]
Ooh baby baby
Ooh baby

[Chorus: Prince and Mayte]

[Bridge: Prince]
And when the stars ever fell one by one from the sky
I know Mars could not be too far behind
'Cause baby, this kind of beauty has got no reason to ever be shy
'Cause honey, this kind of beauty is the kind that comes from inside

[Pre-Chorus: Prince]
Ooh baby baby
Ooh baby

[Chorus: Prince]
Could you be

It's plain to see
(Like he said you're a sexy mutha--)
You're the reason that God made a girl, oh yes you are
(Like he said you're a sexy mutha--)

[Outro: Prince and Mayte]
And if the stars
(Like he said you're a sexy mutha--)
Ever fell one by one from the sky
(Like he said you're a sexy mutha--)
Oh yes,I know Mars
(Like he said you're a sexy mutha--)
Could not be too far behind
(Like he said you're a sexy mutha--)
Could you be
(Like he said you're a sexy mutha--)
The most beautiful girl in the world?
(Like he said you're a sexy mutha--)
So beautiful, beautiful
(Like he said you're a sexy mutha--)
Could you be

Oooooh, oooh, ooooh

[Intro]
Could you be the most beautiful girl in the world?
Could you be?
It's plain to see
It's plain to see
You're the reason that God made a girl
Oh, yes you are

[Verse 1]
When the day turns into the last day of all time (All time)
I can say I hope that you are in these arms of mine (These arms of mine)
And when the night falls before that day I will cry (Cry, cry)
Tears of joy 'cause after you all one can do is die (Die)
All I wanna do is die

[Chorus]
Could you be the most beautiful girl in the world?
Could you be?
It's plain to see
It's plain to see
You're the reason that God made a girl
Oh, yes you are (Oh, yes you are)

[Verse 2]
How can I get through days when I can't get through hours?
I can try but when I do I see you and I'm devoured
Who'd allow a face to be soft as a flower? (Oh so soft)
Oh, I could bow (bow down) and feel proud in the light of this power, power, power, power
(Baby you got the power)
Could you be, b-b-b-baby?

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And if the stars ever fell one by one from the sky
Baby, all I know about is you you and I
All wrapped up in each other's thighs
Baby baby, let me feel the beauty inside

[Chorus]
Could you be the most beautiful girl in the world?
(Beautiful, beautiful)
It's plain to see
It's plain to see
You're the reason that God made a girl
Could you be the most beautiful girl in the world?
(Baby, could you be the most beautiful girl in the world?)

[Outro]
If the stars fell one by one from the sky
I know Mars could not be, uh, too far behind

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Memories consume, like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I know it's not alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than anytime before
I had no options left again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I'll paint it on the walls 'cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again and this is how it ends

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
I’m breaking the habit tonight

¡You say!

I'm breaking the habit
Breaking the habit
Tonight

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I pray I find you at the bottom of the hill
I  pray I make it outta Texas
I  pray my A/C come back on
My mom was stuck outside her job
My sister just asked for a Lexus
Can  Jesus send me a message?
What's  the point of havin' a best friend if you end up losin' him?
World don't view my text messages
World  don't view my text messages
Don't view my bad side
Only get on the 'Gram to show you motherfuckers the best side
Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?
Why  I hide? Huh
Fourth grade, Mary J. Blige all I like
I made a mill' off a lie and a lie so I write another lie
RCA‚ that note wasn't 'bout y'all
No lies‚ it was about how me and my brothers been traumatized
And I must keep creatin' truths and hooks to get up outta this hell for myself
Seashells

[Chorus: Joba]
Dearly departed
Look what you've started
I've been so heartless
I try‚ I try, I try
Why?
Why?
Why?
Try

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Big dog, I feel like I don't got anybody on my side no more
Highs to lows‚ truth be told
It's hard to ignore, hard to endure
Where's my stamina in this life?
Make sure my family tight
More rubies on my neck and they catch me at night
Lookin' immaculate, no one in sight
Standards are high‚ expectations are low
Wake up sweatin' at night, mind in a flight
I don't get scared no more when I'm standin' on the mountaintop
I'm afraid of people dyin'
Rest in peace Wako, Ray, Rita
Wish you could've took me to Japan
Back ten years, holdin' my hand, felt like a hundred grand
Wish them letters didn't fade, love will never do the same
Out the window screamin' your name, bless it
Mama on track, my dad got my back
My sister graduated, now she racin'
Love her through the days and whiskey in my hand
Bloody colored trinkets wrapped around my wrist
Lookin' magnificent, man
No stoppin' me, no boggin' me down
I know myself, me and the obstacles now
I done shit on myself too much to not know how to move properly now
On the property now, money gets foul
Keep your wits about you
They stretch the truth longer than the Nile
Eyes full of evil, mouth full of vile
They tracin' your smile
Stay alert, big dog
Only one life is offered to you
(Only one life is offered to you)

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
How many sides to a story can there be when you saw it with your own eyes?
I got all my thoughts out on records y'all won't ever hear
Tried to give it time
Find that truth trickles down, hits the fan
Freezes over like a dagger to the spine
When somebody that you know throws you in the fire
How do you survive?
I kicked down the door inside a home I didn't own just to save a friend's life
Little did I know, the one who pulled the strings was once on my side
I had just moved to Texas, tried to make it right
I do not feel obliged to dismiss the truth because of how I feel about our time
If I knew what you would do to someone you owe money to, you wouldn't get a dime
Watch for where you land, sorry 'bout your plans
That was all a scam, you won't understand
Pass the weight off to your friends and never face the truth
Because you never learned how to be a man
And it's not my fault, and it's not my problem anymore
That's just where you stand
That's just who you are
That's your cross to bear
You could talk to God
I don't wanna hear, motherfucker

[Verse 1]
I know that you been cheated
Your  heart's taken a beating
You  won't take this anymore
Secrets that you been keeping
Your ex can't stop creeping
I  think you should let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
Why  are you always falling for the ones who hurt ya?
Who hurt ya
I'll  keep on breaking down the walls till I deserve ya
Deserve ya

[Chorus]
I know that I can be be-better for ya, better for ya
All that you want, yeah, I get, get it for ya, get it for ya
No  rush, no pressure, pressure
No risk, no treasure, treasure
I know that I can be be-better for ya, better for ya

[Post-Chorus]
Better for ya
Better for ya

[Verse 2]
Hold up, what you gon' do now?
I know what you been through now
It's cool, you can trust in me
Know that there'll be no faking
My heart is up for the taking
I got your back so follow me

[Pre-Chorus]
Why are you always falling for the ones who hurt ya?
Who hurt ya
I'll keep on breaking down the walls till I deserve ya
Deserve ya

[Chorus]
I know that I can be be-better for ya, better for ya
All that you want, yeah, I get, get it for ya, get it for ya
No rush, no pressure pressure
No risk, no treasure treasure
I know that I can be be-better for ya, better for ya

[Post-Chorus]
Better for ya
Better for ya
Better for ya
Better for ya

[Bridge]
I know that I can be be-better for ya, better for ya
All that you want, yeah, I get, get it for ya

[Chorus]
I know that I can be be-better for ya, better for ya
All that you want, yeah, I get get it for ya, get it for ya
No rush, no pressure, pressure
No risk, no treasure, treasure
I know that I can be be-better for ya, better for ya

[Outro]
Woah woah woah
Better for ya, better for ya
Woah woah woah
Better for ya, better for ya

[Intro]
Yeah, mmm

[Verse 1]
I'm done hatin' myself for feelin'
I'm done cryin' myself awake
I gotta leave and start the healin'
But when you move like that, I just wanna stay

[Pre-Chorus]
What have I become now?
Lookin' through your phone now
Oh now, love to you is just a game
Look what I have done now
Dialling up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break

[Chorus]
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me, how do you lie?
Lie, lie
Love will keep you up tonight

[Verse 2]
Oh, no, how did I manage to lose me?
I am not this desperate, not this crazy
There's no way I'm stickin' 'round to find out
I won't lose like that, I won't lose myself

[Pre-Chorus]
Look what I have done now
Diallin' up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break

[Chorus]
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me, how do you lie?
Lie, lie
Love will keep you up tonight
Tell me, how do you lie?
Lie, lie
Love will keep you up tonight

[Outro]
Tell me, how do you lie?
Tell me, how do you lie?
Tell me, how do you lie?
Tell me, how do you lie?

[Intro: Young Thug]
(BL$$D)
I just let lil' mama suck me up, girl
Is you tryna cry in a Rolls Royce or the bus‚ girl?
I jumped off the porch and went straight up‚ girl (Straight up‚ girl)
You can leave your town and head to another world

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
What the move?
I'm tired of eyein' you
I'm tired of spyin' on you
'Til the pain mines too
I made it rain on you
When it was hard to maintain too
I was playin' games with you
Like you could never play games too, woah (Yeah)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
You just gotta tell me what you want (Tell me what you want)
Louis Vuitton, diamonds‚ keep calm (Okay)
All you do is point at what you want (Point it out)
Crystal cut pointers in the charm, c'mon (Oh yeah)
Thirty-five dollars for a duff' (For a duff')
Nigga tryna buy the cash cost (Woo)
Percy Miller, brazy with the woes
Thirty-five dollars for a duff' (For a duff')
You make it twerk for me
You get a purse from me
Eighty thousand dollars for her Birkin
You get a verse for free
I make her worship me
Copy it in bursts for me
Turn to a P-I-M-P‚ I make her work for me
You don't want the bag, oh no, no, no
I make her drop it and pop it and work it on my nose
I make her shut up then suck it, she fuckin' at my shows, mmh
I make her shut up, she fuckin', she suckin' at my shows, ayy

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Drip, drip, no shoestring my sneaker, won't trip
My jeans is so tight they don't fit
Still walk around with a stick on my hip
VVS diamonds right behind my lip
Don't walk with less than fifty on my wrist
Diamonds so cold on my neck, it got me sick
Raf Simons, mix it up with the Rick
Flexin' on these haters who sent me 'my bad'
Made it from the soil, made it from the Rex
Richer than your first, richer than your last
LUV, know I got swag
Pop a rubber band, pop another Xan'
I groove around, party pack my hand
I'm seeing double lookin' through my lens
Tell me what you want, I just want your friend

You know where the bag at, tell me where it is
I came from rags to riches, I'm the shit
I can no longer disguise it, bitch, 'cause I'm rich
I got cars galore, lil' bitch, 'cause I'm rich
I escaped every one of the licks 'cause I was supposed to be rich
I don't care nothin' 'bout no cop, I'm tellin' you just how it is

Put it in a Uber, send it to a shooter
Ask me how they do it, kickin' shit, Ryu, Ken
Put it in a cab, send it to a Arab

No fly zone, caught you like you're Moss in this bitch
Growin' tycoon and I took some losses, you bitch
I'm a boss, but I don't like to take a loss in this bitch (Wheezy outta here)
Such a player but I cake and cuddle all of my bitches

Fuck around and air the pussy nigga out like linen
Last nigga tried me almost got popped in Lenox
Ask the cops, ask the detectives, they know all the business
Ask the cops and the detectives, all the jurisdictions
Ask the kids at school who ambition all the missions
Gave the lawyer close to two mil', he handle all the killings
I don't know and I don't wanna know who 'flaged Bentleys
I don't know what's goin' with bro, I think they all spillin'
We don't speak 'bout shit on wax, it's all mob business
We known to kill the biggest cats of all kitties

Half a million, I just did a warm up for half a million, uh, uh, mmm

Kicked out the hotel, we smoking gas, who else, nigga?
Flooded belt buckle like a wrestler, yes, nigga
Better not try to tell me what you seen a nigga doin'
She not fuckin' with me, then her life is probably ruined
We can leave America and we can make a movie
Every single diamond on me dancing like a movie
Make lil' mama nut inside her pants just like a movie
Abracadabra, tight pussy, need a toothpick
Throw away the fives and some of the dimes, and then I got twenties and up
I come with the vibes and some of the guys and I got a flooded Patek
I peep how you slide, I peep how you ride, and now they goin' off with your head
They know the reward's a hundred racks so they gon' do all that they can
Don't tell me you ridin' if you not gon' ride, we don't got no time for that playin'
We don't come disguised, we gangsters for life, my nigga, we showin' our hands
I had turned the vibe my lil' wife, she'll never be single again
They hate and throw rice, we richer for life, I used to serve ice, yikes (Hey)

Big tipper, Big, Big Dipper
King spiller, bitch, king dripper

Jump in the back, this is a bulletproof 'Lac
500 racks, baby said, "Don't get fat"

She got Eliantte on her neck
Light blue, all the hunduns, let it spread
I told her it's nap time, with the red
Rolls Royce, Forgiato, what I said
Sippin' lean, but got no sinus
I could turn to a mad scientist
Board a jet in like any climate
Bitches tryna come over and dine in
Throw 11 like Matt Ryan
Most my bitches and me are tight and
Hurt her heart with no Neosporin, then
I'ma watch it like WiFi

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Clear water on her neck, nigga, don't see the shark (Ice, splash)
Back to back, double R trucks, no key to park it (Double R)
Name the location, we mark it (Hey)
We gotta move the smartest (Move)
I got a K in my office (Brra)
You ever seen a carcass? (Body)
Growed up to be an arsoner (Fire)
Breathin' out fire, like oxygen
McLaren, it came equipped (Skrrt)
Pressin' the gas, and exhaust the whip
We get the strain and dip (Strain)
Can't pull up on me, come get your chips (Cash)
Heard car got flipped (Flipped)
They might pull up on you with sticks in the Lyft

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Hey, I'm countin' these racks up in the bed
I still took the pill, didn't know what it said
They catering Activis at the weddin'
I travel with the Draco or the 'chete
You think that she straight
I'm turnin' her gay, got her kissin' a lady
She quiet as kept, I slap on her face and bite on her lips
My closet silk, the Maybach outside, and the floor is equipped
I don't recept', no receptionists, I don't accept
Tall, red shit, yeah, she inspire me
Woo, flavor, no freak, make a bitch shine my teeth
Teeth, we don't want peace, yeah, we're clearly young beasts
Oh, oh, oh, I gotta speed, baby, this a Lamborghini (Woah)
Woah, I don't need a seat, I'd rather run through the streets
Woo, hunnid K a week, livin' at the Grand Marquis
Woo, how much I can eat? I gotta see
Whoo, I gotta see, I was at the Grand Marquis

[Chorus: Quavo]
Divide the shooters (Divide)
Then split up the house

Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot

[Chorus: Gunna]
Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot
I created history and made me a lot
He tried to diss me and ended on Fox
We call them chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop
Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Cartier eye
I'm the bossman in a suit but no tie
I can't be sober, I gotta stay high
Pour me some syrup in a Canada Dry
Ridin' in the spaceship like Bonnie and Clyde
Don't worry, baby, I keep me some fire
Shenenehs and Birkins, she cannot decide
The latest Mercedes her go-to surprise
Don't sleep on miss lady, her pussy a prize
Dick in her back while I'm grippin' her sides
Bigger Maybach, this ain't regular size
We really fly, we like pelican glide
Bitch, you ain't slick, I can tell the disguise
Upgraded my wrist, put baguettes in that Sky
She sing, I might sign her and change her whole life
I told her to gargle and work on her highs

[Chorus: Gunna]
Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot
I created history and made me a lot
He tried to diss me and ended on Fox
We call them chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop
Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock

[Interlude: Young Thug]
Cash, money, checks, cash
Addy, Birkin, brand new extendos
I just wanna fuck the bitch by myself
I just passed her to the dawg like my Sprite

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I took the Bentley coupe back, then I hopped in a Cayenne (Skrrt)
I put the bitch in the front of the Bentley, in front of the driver (Skrrt)
Ayy, man, this synthetic weed, you can't smoke in the Rolls Royce, woah, woah (Yeah, yeah)
I'm still double cupped up, I'm drinkin', I shoot off your tires, huh (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
I'm in the coupe by myself
I had to kick a door when I was 5
Keep the awards on the shelf
Whole sixteen round in the fire
I'm sick and tired of these young niggas act like they firin', they tellin' these lies
Actin' like they the ones created this and they get all the drip from my guys
Yeah, Cartier eyes
Cartier coat, Cartiers the watch
Cartier love, Cartier the thot
Cartier specs, buffalo on the side
Princess cut diamonds, they Cartier, yeah
Cartier bag for the Cartier thot
Sky Wrangler coupe with two hundred the dash
Cartier jeans, ain't no way I can sag
Ain't no way I'ma ever gon' go out bad
I can't go out, no way I'ma go out
I just grip on her ass and I show out
I sit like a champ and I wait on a hold-out
I just whip up a new Chanel Patek
I whip with the wrist and I don't break the door out
Turn the whole top floor to a whorehouse
Hundred racks in ones, dude brought the flood out

[Verse]
Once upon a time, it was paradise
Once upon a time, I was paralyzed
Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights
But it's time to let it go
Once upon a time, it was made for us
Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
I want my house in the hills
Don't want the whiskey and pills
I don't give up easily
But I don't think I'm down

[Chorus]
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away

[Verse Reprise]
Once upon a time, it was paradise
Once upon a time, I was paralyzed
Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights
But it's time to let it go
Once upon a time, it was made for us (For us)
Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
Move on, we're not seventeen
I'm not who I used to be
You say that everything changed
You're right, we're grown now

[Chorus]
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away

Move on, we're not seventeen

Bones sinking like stones
All that we've fought for
Homes, places we’ve grown
All of us are done for

We live in a beautiful world
Yeah we do
Yeah we do
We live in a beautiful world

Bones sinking like stones
All that we've fought for
Homes, places we've grown
All of us are done for

We live in a beautiful world

We live in a beautiful world
Yeah we do
Yeah we do
We live in a beautiful world
Oh all that I know
There’s nothing here to run from
'Cause here
Everybody here's got somebody to lean on
I awake to find no peace of mind
I said, "How do you live as a fugitive
Down here where I cannot see so clear?"
I said, "What do I know
Show me the right way to go"

And the spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
That the spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them no
'Cause they're all spies
They're all spies

I awake to see that no one is free
We're all fugitives
Look at the way we live
Down here I cannot sleep from fear no
I said, "Which way do I turn?"
Oh I forget everything I learn

And the spies came out of the water
And you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
That the spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them no
'Cause they're all spies
They're all spies
So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention do you
I know you don't listen to me
'Cause you say you see straight through me, don't you?

But on and on, from the moment I wake
'Til the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side
Just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line
Just to see if you care

Oh, did you want me to change?
Well I changed for good
And I want you to know
That you'll always get your way
I wanted to say

Don't you shiver
Shiver
Sing it loud and clear
I'll always be waiting for you
So you know how much I need you
But you never even see me do you?
And is this my final chance of getting you?
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah they were all yellow

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called yellow

So then I took my turn
Oh what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
You know you know I love you so
You know I love you so

I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
And you know
For you I'd bleed myself dry
For you I'd bleed myself dry

It's true
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do

Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairy tale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you

[Verse 1]
This feeling, it's something when you call me
I'm dealing in death and being lonely
Try it, don't like it
And leaving you here is the thing that I fear, so I fight it

[Chorus]
Do you wanna leave at the same time?
Do you wanna leave at the same time?
Do you wanna leave at the same time?
Do you wanna leave at the same time?

[Verse 2]
I'm reeling, I know that I'm appalling
But this feeling, it could be our calling
Not dying, no, just lying
Seeing you here is the moment it's clear 'cause I'm crying

[Chorus]
Do you wanna leave at the same time?
Do you wanna leave at the same time?
Do you wanna leave at the same time?
Do you wanna leave at the same time?

[Verse 1]
They're calling out your name
Must have been something you were saying
They're calling out your name
What should I say?
(Tell 'em the things that you told me)
They're calling out your name
Must have been something you changed
They're calling out your name
What should I say? What should I say?

[Chorus]
(Tell 'em the things that you told me)
What should I say?
(Tell 'em the things that you told me)

[Bridge]
What did you say?
Tell 'em that all the people made me

What should I say? What should I say?

[Chorus]
(Tell 'em the things that you told me)
What should I say?

[Verse 2]
They're calling out your name (Out your name)
Must have been something you were saying
(Must have been something you were saying)
They're calling out your name (Out your name)
What should I say? (What should I say?)
(Tell 'em the things that you told me)
Disorder, hate, and fame (And fame)
Making sure that people won't change
Disorder, hate, and fame
What should I say? What should I say?

[Outro]

[Intro]
I tell you I can visualise it all
Too real it all seems
But once again, runnin' away with me
Once again‚ runnin' away with me
This couldn't be a dream
Runnin' away with me
Runnin' away with me

[Verse 1]
And I stop myself for a minute
See if my heart's still in it
Say a few things just to win it
Funny how it works out‚ innit?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I told her‚ "Some things have their time
How can I be yours if you're not mine?"
She said, "They should take this pain
And give it a name"

[Chorus]
Tonight, I wish I was your boy
(Run away from me‚ run away from me)
I (Run away from me, run away from me)
Tonight, I think I fucked it royally
(Run away from me‚ run away from me)
(Run away from me, run away from me)

[Verse 2]
Give yourself a new name
Change your voice on the train
Have her complain about your fame
Tell me that it's all a rigged game

[Pre-Chorus]
She told me, "Some things just take time
How can you be sure if you won't try?"
She said, "I guess I'll take this pain
Instead of your name"

[Chorus]
Tonight, I wish I was your boy
(Run away from me, run away from me)
I (Run away from me, run away from me)
Tonight, I think I fucked it royally
(Run away from me, run away from me)
(Run away from me, run away from me)

[Bridge]
And it's been replaying on my mind
Unfortunately, I've been to this place in my life
Far too many times
Sunday's nearly over, so I'll just lie awake
Tonight, I wish I was your boy, I
Tonight, I think I fucked it royally

[Chorus]
And tonight, I wish I was your boy
(Run away from me, run away from me)
I (Run away from me, run away from me, runnin' away with me)
Tonight, I think I fucked it royally
(Run away from me, run away from me)
(Run away from me, run away from me, runnin' away with me)

[Outro]
Runnin' away with me
Runnin' away with me

[Verse 1]
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Chorus]
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

[Verse 2]
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Chorus]
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

[Refrain]
I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'Cause you're the one that I want
I can't believe, I can't believe
I'm not afraid anymore
Goddamn, you got me in love again

[Bridge]
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
Oh, goddamn, you got me in love again
(We're in love, we're in love)
(We're in love, we're in love, oh, oh)

[Refrain]
I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'Cause you're the one that I want
I can't believe there's something left inside my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Chorus]
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again (Again and again)
Again (And again and again and again)

[Verse 1]
They say I’m wasting time, they say that I’m no good
Summer of my life, not doing what I should
Call me poison ivy ‘cause I’m far from good
I’m pretty from afar like a dark star

[Verse 2]
They say I’m dangerous, they think I’m really bad
I’m just making up for what I never had
Go out every night whenever I feel sad
Oh, this drive-by love got me crazy like a drug

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I wear my red lipstick, got my makeup on
Stumble into trouble, siren with a sad song
They all got girlfriends but I’m the one that they want
Miss America with the blue mascara on

[Chorus]
I spend my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding 'round town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we be and where we go
Now we know, baby, now we know
Spend my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock 'n' roll, dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we be and where we go
Now we know, baby, now we know

[Verse 3]
In Mommy’s Mercedes or Billy’s pickup truck
Come out late at night and baby picks me up
Tell him just drive on and d-don’t ever stop
Don’t take me home again, take me to a new land

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wear my red lipstick, grab my coat and gun
Wonder if this is it, it’s darkest before dawn
Sometimes I want to give in, but I just have to go on
Miss America, now I’m gone, baby, gone

[Chorus]
I spend my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding 'round town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we be and where we go
Now we know, baby, now we know
Spend my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock 'n' roll, dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we be and where we go
Now we know, baby, now we know

[Bridge]
I was born to live fast, die young
Leave a beautiful corpse, live my life on the run
Got my cash and my Louis Vuitton, diamonds and guns
Girls just wanna, just wanna have fun

[Breakdown]
I spend my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding 'round town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we be and where we go

[Chorus]
I spend my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding 'round town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we be and where we go
Now we know, baby, now we know
Spend my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock 'n' roll, dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we be and where we go
Now we know, baby, now we know

Bae I love your accent, and what's your practice? (What's your practice?)
Baby I love your practice, like I love my practice
Talkin' 'bout stripper practice, and white wall practice

Bad lil' ten, she nasty
Diamonds on fleek, they dancin'

[Verse 1: Chris Brown, Sevyn Streeter & Both]
If you would just end it, girl, I'd just walk away
I wouldn't give a damn, I would just give up on us
But I need you (Oh)
What you doing? You doing the same shit
You're just taking the heart that I gave you
And you breaking the home that I made for you
And you say that I'm paranoid
Trippin', I'm on your phone tryna find them other boys
Trippin', 'cause I

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Fallen, I'm headed fast
About to crash for your love
But there's no love with no trust

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
Got me thinking my mind is playing tricks on me
Trying not to believe what I see
But these thoughts in my head
It's telling me that you been cheating
Late at night, creeping on the low
I know sometimes I trip but this time, I ain't crazy
Ain't findin' the knowledge to settle in
On somewhere else, way back
'Cause I caught you red handed, red handed

[Verse 2: Chris Brown, Sevyn Streeter & Both]
I said, "Girl, who's on the phone?"
She said, "Nothing, I'll tell you later"
I said, "No, girl, tell me now"
She said, "Why you acting crazy?"
Why I'm acting crazy?
'Cause I wanna know who it is on the phone with my baby (Yeah)
She said, "Baby, stop tripping
I was talking to my girls"
"Then why them numbers show up blocked, babe?
Guess she must have changed it
Girl, I don't know what kind of game you playing (Yeah)
And I don't wanna say shit 'cause I'm

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
Falling, I'm headed fast
About to crash for your love
But there's no love with no trust

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter, Chris Brown & Both]
Got me thinking my mind is playing tricks on me
Trying not to believe what I see
(Start to believe)
But these thoughts in my head
It's telling me that you been cheating
Late at night, creeping on the low (Whoa)
I know sometimes I trip but this time, I ain't crazy (Yeah<)
Ain't findin' the knowledge to settle in (Oh-whoa)
On somewhere else, way back
'Cause I caught you red handed (Ayy), red handed (Yeah)

[Bridge: Sevyn Streeter]
You're not the criminal
Feel like you wanna lose
Running with my heart
But I'm not catching you
In the back of my head, always knew the truth
But it hurts, it still hurts
I gave you everything, look what I get back
All the shit I bought for you, wish I could take it back
But I can't
Call it my intuition, I saw all this coming, oh

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
Got me thinking my mind is playing tricks on me
Trying not to believe what I see
But these thoughts in my head
It's telling me that you been cheating
Late at night, creeping on the low
I know sometimes I trip but this time, I ain't crazy
Ain't findin' the knowledge to settle in
On somewhere else, way back
'Cause I caught you red handed, red handed

[Verse 1]
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beatin' heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost

[Verse 2]
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost

When I come through on the dance floor, checking out that catalogue
Can't believe my eyes
So many women without a flaw
And I ain't gonna give it up
Steady, tryna pick it up, like a call
I'mma hit it, I'mma beat it and latch onto it until tomorrow, yeah
Shorty, I can see that you got so much energy
The way you twirling up them hips 'round and 'round
And there is no reason at all why you can't leave here with me
In the meantime, stay and let me watch you break it down

And dance
Gonna be okay (Oh-oh)

The Fame

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
I can't help myself
I'm addicted to a life of material
It's some kind of joke
I'm obsessively opposed to the typical
All we care about is runway models, Cadillacs and liquor bottles
Give me something, I wanna be retro glamour
Hollywood, yes, we live for the...

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Fame (Fame)
Doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame (Fame)
Doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we got a taste for champagne and endless fortune

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Fame, fame, baby
The fame, fame
We live for the fame, fame, baby
The fame, fame
Isn't it a shame, shame, baby?
A shame, shame
In it for the fame, fame, baby
The fame, fame

Nowhere
Yeah, we’re goin' nowhere fast
Maybe this time

C-c-c-crazy (crazy)
Get your ass in my bed
Baby, you’ll be just my summer boyfriend
(Summerboy...)

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Let’s get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice, we can be alone
Bikini top’s comin' o-o-off
Don’t be sad when the sun goes down
You’ll wake up, and I’m not around
I’ve got to go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We’ll still have the summer after all

LoveGame

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
I wanna kiss you
But if I do, then I might miss you, babe
It's complicated and stupid
Got my ass squeezed by sexy Cupid
Guess he wants to play, wants to play a lovegame, a lovegame

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit it
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame
Do you want love, or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans, the lovegame
Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame
Do you want love, or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans, the lovegame

[Intro]
Oh, no
Oh, no, no
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I been focused way too much
Need to get out, need to do something
Feels like I'm going distant
Music made the pain too numb
Money bringing out the demons
Life-changing, never seen it (For real)
My life changed in an instant
Never been the same since then
That's why I do what I do
Not for the Bentley coupe, nah (Nah, nah)
Not for the Louis V shoes
This for my mom and the crew, yeah
Used to be tight like glue
But I done went and switched up on you (Sorry)
But not because I wanted to
But not because I wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I'm all up in mine (All up in mine)
I tell myself lies constantly, I been fighting
All of these demons that are dancing inside (Dancin' inside)
Bawling my eyes, RIP to my slime, rest up in paradise

[Chorus]
Now I'm too caught in my feelings (Caught in my feelings)
Feeling a way, yeah
Now I'm too caught up on winning (Caught up on winning)
Winning the race, yeah
But now I'm too caught in my feelings (Caught in my feelings)
Feeling a way, yeah
Now I'm too caught up on winning (Caught up on winning)
Now I'm too caught up on winning (Caught up on winning)

[Post-Chorus]
And now I'm too caught in my feelings
Feeling a way, yeah
Now I'm too caught up on winning
Now I'm too caught up on winning
And now I'm too caught in my feelings
Feeling a way, yeah (Yeah)
Now I'm too caught up on winning
Now I'm too caught up on winning

[Verse 2]
I might have lost everyone else, but I haven't lost myself
I still kept my worth, but I'm not talking wealth
And they still chuck their dirt, but I still got my stealth
And as long as I got myself, I don't need no one else
I pour my pain on these pages
And I been doing it for ages
Deaf ears to what they're saying
Never given to me, had to take it
We used to be stuck like glue
But I done went and switched up on you
But not because I wanted to
But not because I wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I'm all up in mine (All up in mine)
I tell myself lies constantly, I been fighting
All of these demons that are dancing inside (Dancin' inside)
Bawling my eyes, RIP to my slime, rest up in paradise

Now I'm too caught in my feelings (Caught in my feelings)
Feeling a way, yeah
Now I'm too caught up on winning (Caught up on winning)
Winning the race, yeah

[Verse 1]
From In Living Color to movie scripts
To On the 6 to J. Lo to this
Headline clips
I stay grounded as the amounts roll in
I'm real I thought I told ya (I'm real)
I'm really been on Oprah (I'm real)
That's just me
Nothing phony, don't hate on me
What you get is what you see, oh (Southside Bronx)

[Chorus]
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from (From the Bronx)
Dont be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from (Southside Bronx, from the Bronx)

[Verse 2]
I'm down to earth like this
Rocking this business
I've grown up so much
I'm in control and loving it
Rumors got me laughing kid
I love my life and my public
Put God first and can't forget to stay real (Real)
To me it's like breathing, yeah (Southside Bronx)

[Chorus]
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from (From the Bronx)
Dont be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

[Verse 1]
Despite me or not I'm still willing
My heart is flat like a valentine
We're on a linear trajectory, more of the same please
I don't know suffering, I just move forward

[Chorus]
Meet me on flat earth
On flat earth, you can be certain while you sleep
Just like a piece of paper or a friendly neighbor
So shallow that its deep

[Verse 2]
Lie to me or not I'm still willing
Although the deed will be returned
What are you saying to me over too many blue drinks?
You find simple seductive, I think we're just bored

[Chorus]
Meet me on flat earth
On flat earth, you can be certain while you sleep
Just like a piece of paper or a friendly neighbor
So shallow that its deep

[Refrain]
Meet me on flat earth
Meet me on flat earth
Our chrysins are concrete
Meet me on flat earth
Meet me on flat earth
Stand up on two feet

[Verse 1]
Taking her back again, what can I do?
Taking her back again, what can I do?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
If I'd done things your way, I'd be set back thousands of years
I think in disbelief while you sip your beer

[Verse 2]
Taking her back again, what can I do?
Taking her back again, what can I do?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Listen to you, who's had your number
For the hot one, taken so smooth
I think in disbelief, is this digital you

[Outro]
Look over my shoulder

[Verse 1]
You said "I have a nude for you"
You were getting dressed for work and listening to the news
Send it over, to say the catch was caught
And that the fight was fought
Well that's accurate

[Chorus]
Connected, lounging in the future
Speaking in the present tense
Speaking in the present tense
Connected, lounging in the future
Speaking in the present tense
And building suspense

[Bridge]
Guess who's on my mind right now?
Think of a clever thing to say
Guess who can't talk right now?
I'll compliment you another day

[Verse 2]
You said bring me back
Savon Olay
Late night messages as we drive through the day
Send it over, to say the sight was sought
And that the night was nought
Well that's inaccurate

[Chorus]
Connected, lounging in the future
Speaking in the present tense
Speaking in the present tense
Connected, lounging in the future
Speaking in the present tense
And building suspense

[Bridge]
Guess who's on my mind right now?
Think of a clever thing to say
Guess who can't talk right now?
I'll compliment you another day
Ready in an instant anyhow
The present is so far away
Sell me blunt force, a method that still works
To stay on course, infamy does have its perks

Sell me blunt force, a method that still works
To stay on course, keep it in-house and then outsource

Sell me blunt force, a method that still works
To stay on course, and infamy does have its perks

Sell me blunt force, the only thing that really works
To stay on course, how else could it?

[Verse 1]
Try do your work in the morning
Although I don't want to leave you there
It's quite disconcerting
I'm aware we're due to pay our share

[Chorus]
At happy hours we talk and talk
Are you nervous for your career?
Are you insincere?

[Bridge]
Striving for self-worth
Every morning

[Verse 2]
Give your report in the mirror
Although I wish could be there
Don't let me interfere while you work
I can't help but stare

[Chorus]
At happy hours we talk and talk
Are you nervous for your career?
Are you insincere?

[Bridge]
Striving for self-worth
Every morning

[Chorus]
At happy hours we talk, and talk
Are you nervous for your, career?
Are you insincere?

[Outro]
Sincerely yours, Sincerely yours
Sincerely yours, Sincerely yours

[Verse]
After hours, history lesson
And a smile that keeps you guessin'
And for the small-town feature
They set ablaze, their teacher

[Pre-Chorus]
And all the beautiful, professional
Now making her dinner plans

[Chorus]
Above all
Where's the courtesy call?

[Refrain]
We have this funny routine
The others will be right with you
Certainty, remain unseen
Don't worry, we've got you

[Intermission]
Too much surprise, you've seen
Compromise, I'm further with you
Sanitize, dose me and
Realize, you're sick too
So what's slated?

[Pre-Chorus]
Where was she supposed to be?
Oh, found the keys to her SUV

[Chorus]
Above all
Where's the courtesy call?
Above all
Where's the courtesy call?

[Refrain]
We have this funny routine
The others will be right with you
Certainty, remain unseen
Don't worry, we've got you

[Outro]
We have this funny routine
What's slated, what's slated for me?

[Verse 1]
When nothing's missing, it can be frightening
Raising the drawbridge sure seems inviting

[Pre-Chorus]
Out of reach, you and your moat felt a sense of power
A suiter drowns just too doked every half hour

[Chorus]
Do you throw the rope?
Provide a little hope
You're so forgiving
When you can't afford to be

[Verse 2]
You don't look like a decade, you're a century
Details and contradictions to analyze carefully

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been sick since I met you, what won't you devour?
Is love such a foul to do at the hour?

[Chorus]
Do you throw the rope?
Provide a little hope
You're so forgiving
When you can't afford to be

[Verse 1]
Teach me to drive your car
Old  models are so cool

[Chorus]
Underage 
What a rage
Are we all on the same page?

I  only kiss the guardrail
It's  a steady pursuit
Your friend William says
I  remind him so much of you

[Chorus]
Underage
What a rage
Are we all on the same page?

[Post-Chorus]
If  we could ever get that smoke scent off your jacket
If we could ever interrupt that foreign accent

[Verse 2]
I cannot have it that way in my house
If you continue, you'll never get denounced
I cannot have it that way in my house
If you continue

[Chorus]
Underage
What a rage
Are we all on the same page?

[Post-Chorus]
If we could ever get that smoke scent off your jacket
If we could ever interrupt that foreign accent

[Verse 3]
Is there no way to get around you except through?
Is there no way to get around you except through?

[Verse 1]
Continue to abort me, but you'd like more photos to see
Are you dreaming of the stranger that turns you on?
Tell me bangs or no bangs, buttoned or unbuttoned, show the fangs
Direct message and obsessive come light me up

[Bridge]
'Cause all I need to bore you

[Chorus]
If you don't like what you see, the presentation of me
The pretty face on the screen, oh
Scroll on by and don't be lingering out of sight in an intimate light
You must have the skeleton key, an opening

[Verse 2]
Someone from another county, well how the hell have you found me?
Are you dreaming of the stranger that turns you on?
Tell me bangs or no bangs, buttoned or unbuttoned, show the fangs
Direct message and aggressive come light me up

[Bridge]
'Cause all I need

[Refrain]
A pretty casual decision
Unremittent and omission
I've given you the skeleton key
A pretty casual decision
Unremittent and omission
I've given you the skeleton key
A pretty casual decision
Unremittent and omission
I've given you the skeleton key
A pretty casual decision
Unremittent and omission
I've given you the skeleton key
I feel I might be insatiable
There are too many variables
I treat my hair, it's a welcome distraction
And when you come home, it's a new attraction

I'm an imposter
I blend like wallpaper
Imposter
I blend like wallpaper

I ordered Lemon Drop, I ordered Chartreuse
Is this appropriate? A subliminal abuse

Meet us in the bedroom
Is the honestest way
You seem like a genuine person yourself
If I hear what you say

I feel I might be miserable
There are too many variables
You like your things where they belong
Yeah, hard to resist
I master these details to help me exist
I'm an impostor
I blend like wallpaper
Impostor
I blend like wallpaper

Meet us in the bedroom
It's so gentle this way
You seem like a genuine person yourself
If I hear what you say

Buy me out
They're gonna bum me out

[?]
Find me out
You've got somewhere to be but
You've invited me
Rip the perforated edge walk off the

With your confidence well
Where do I fit in?
Is your silence concentration
Should I take the hint?

Rip the perforated edge walk off the ledge
Have you ever been ahead?
We're busy, oh so dizzy

Am I just for fun
Or crossing boundaries
Telling your colleagues how you found me
Ill be quiet
You don't have to ask
You don't have to wear your sleep mask
Time is money i happen to have neither
No ones is attractive when they're too eager
I'll be quiet you don't have to ask
You don't have to wear your sleep mask
Am I fire
What do we break up to
Rip the perforated edge walk off the ledge
Have you ever been ahead
We're dizzy, oh so busy

You've got something
With your confidence
Should I take a hint?
Should I take a hint?

[Verse 1]
You gave me something, I understand
You gave me loving in the palm of my hand

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't tell you how I feel
My heart is like a wheel

[Chorus]
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you

[Verse 2]
I want to tell you, and now's the time
I want to tell you that you're going to be mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't tell you how I feel
My heart is like a wheel

[Chorus]
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't tell you how I feel
My heart is like a wheel

[Chorus]
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you

[Verse 1]
You gave me something, I understand
You gave me loving in the palm of my hand

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't tell you how I feel
My heart is like a wheel

[Chorus]
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you

[Verse 1]
Running through the nighttime
And looking like a wreck
Got too many highlights and a love bite on her neck
Looking for some pay daddies who'll maybe come around
Everybody's wondering
What's that sound

[Chorus]
Highway
(Do ya, do ya, do ya)
Always
(Do ya, do ya, do ya)

[Verse 2]
Standing in the doorway of a little black shop
Lifting up a pin light and ringing up a cop
Running down the street
Everybody sees
What she's got is what she needs
And what she loves is me

[Chorus] 

[x4]

[Verse 3]
Oh looking in the flowers
Hang on me every hour
Take me high and let me think
Move me baby, move me away
Everybody wondering why you're looking such a wreck
Yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Everybody wondering why she didn't love me more
They damn know what it self
Somebody can move me
Oh I'm feeling naked
Words are getting higher
Everybody fire
Lord the sun is rising again
Words are getting higher
Everybody fire
Lord the sun is rising again

[Outro]
Words are getting higher
Everybody fire
Lord the sun is rising again
Words are getting higher
Everybody fire
Lord the sun is rising again
Words are getting higher
Everybody fire
Lord the sun is rising again

[Verse 1]
The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear

I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door

[Verse 2]
The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears

Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know
The many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back
To the long and winding road
You left me standing here

A long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to you door

[Verse 3]
But still they lead me back
To the long and winding road
You left me standing here

A long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here (Don't keep me waiting)
Lead me to your door

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?"

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

[Verse 2]
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night

[Pre-Chorus]
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down

[Bridge]
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down

[Chorus]
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from (From the Bronx)

[Intro]
Yeah, woo, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You're looking just a little too hard at me
Standing just a little too close to me
You're saying not quite enough to me
You're sipping just a little too slow for me
No doubt you play it real cool, homie
Got me thinking what is it you do for me?
Tripping (Tripping) a little more than I should be
So let yourself go and get right with me

[Chorus]
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, we can get right
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, tonight
(We can get right)

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, huh
Yeah, huh
Yeah, huh
Yeah, huh

[Verse 2]
Your lips talking 'bout I, "Play too much"
Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants?
My hips moving, oh, so slow (So slow)
Bar tab looking like a car note (Car note)
All I need is you here right by my side (Woo)
Take whatever you want, baby, let's ride (Oh)
And whatever you won't do, let me decide
Just put your name on the dotted line

[Chorus]
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, we can get right (Yeah)

I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, tonight

So much we've got to say, but so little time
And if tonight ain't long enough, don't leave love behind
(Don't leave this love behind)
Baby, take my hand, I'll show you why

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, we can get right

[Verse 1]
There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain and the ones that observe
Well, baby, I'm a put-on-a-show kind of girl
Don't like the backseat, got to be first, oh-oh
I'm like the ringleader, I call the shots (I call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot when I put on a show

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me, and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

[Chorus]
All the eyes on me
In the center of the ring, just like a circus
When I crack that whip
Everybody gonna trip, just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go
We can make a dance floor, just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go
We can make a dance floor, just like a circus

[Verse 2]
There's only two types of guys out there
Ones that can hang with me and ones that are scared
So, baby, I hope that you came prepared
I run a tight ship, so beware
I'm like a ringleader, I call the shots (I call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot when I put on a show

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me, and I'm ready to break

Let's go
Let me see what you can do

I'm running this (Like a circus)

Yeah, like a what? (Like a circus)

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me, and I'm ready to break

[Verse 1]
You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinkin' of me
Somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
Things we said today

[Verse 2]
You say you'll be mine, girl
Till the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

[Verse 3]
Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And, though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough

So l hope you don't mind the things I say
On the way

Well, we've been traveling for a long time
And we finally finished here
Though I said some things to hurt you
Well, it was only out of fear

[Chorus]
Wouldn't want to see you crying
So l hope you don't mind the things I say
On the way

[Verse 3]
Well, you know I'll always love you
Everything will be alright
If I know you don't mind the things I say
On the way
I know you don't mind the things I say
On the way
Well, you know I'll always love you
Everything will be okay
If I know you don't mind the things I say
On the way

The other day I met someone I had known in another lifetime
Old puzzle pieces lost without a trace fell into place in my mind
But we both knew what we were getting into

And we didn't wanna stop
No we wouldn't wanna miss it
Cause it seems like old times
So like long ago that I hardly even know
Who's who anymore
What's new anymore
So like long ago that it seems like old times

Familiar music man singing me a song from another lifetime
When urgent letters waiting for the post were uppermost in my mind
But he got through
Then before we knew it

Well we didn't want to stop
Now we didn't wanna do it
Didn't want to stop
Cause we wouldn't wanna miss it
Well it seems like old times
So like long ago that I hardly even know
Who's who anymore
What's true anymore
It's so like long ago that it seems like old times
When you reappeared and the moment I had always feared
Was upon me I felt slightly weird that's for sure
Now life is good to me though I don't see who I used to see
No it's not quite what it used to be anymore that's for sure

So the other day I met someone I had known in another lifetime
Old puzzle pieces lost without a trace fell into place in my mind
But we both knew what we were getting into

And we didn't wanna stop
No we wouldn't wanna miss it
Didn't wanna stop
No I wouldn't wanna miss it
Because it feels, yes cause it seems like old times
So like long ago that I hardly even know
Who's who anymore
What's new anymore
So like long ago that it seems like old times

Seems like old times

[Verse 1]
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

[Verse 2]
Black bird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

[Chorus]
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

[Verse 3]
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
And if I said I really knew you well
What would your answer be
If you were here today?
Ooh ooh ooh, here today

Well, knowing you
You'd probably laugh and say that we were worlds apart
If you were here today
Ooh, ooh, ooh, here today

But as for me, I still remember how it was before
And I am holding back the tears no more
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I love you
Ooh, ooh

What about the time we met? (What about the time?)
Well, I suppose that you could say that we were playing hard to get
Didn't understand a thing, but we could always sing
What about the night we cried? (What about the night?)
Because there wasn't any reason left to keep it all inside
Never understood a word, but you were always there with a smile
And if I say I really loved you and was glad you came along
When you were here today
Ooh, ooh, ooh, for you were in my song
Ooh ooh ooh, here today

[Verse 1]
It was written that I would love you
From the moment I opened my eyes
And the morning when I first saw you
Gave me life under calico skies

[Chorus]
I will hold you for as long as you'd like
I'll hold you for the rest of my life

[Verse 2]
Always looking for ways to love you
Never failing to fight at your side
While the angels of love protect us
From the inner most secrets we hide

[Chorus]
I'll hold you for as long as you'd like
I'll hold you for the rest of my life

[Verse 3]
Long live all of us crazy soldiers
Who were born under calico skies
May we never be called to handle
All the weapons of war we despise

[Chorus]
I'll hold you for as long as you'd like
I'll hold you for the rest of my life
I'll hold you for as long as you'd like
I'll love you for the rest of my
For the rest of my life

[Refrain]
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!

[Verse 1]
Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

[Chorus]
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

[Verse 2]
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

[Chorus]
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

[Refrain]
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!

[Verse 3]
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

[Chorus]
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all belong?

[Chorus 1]
Like the sun playing in the morning
Feel the quiet, feel the thunder
Every ladder leads to heaven
Sing the changes, draw the picture

[Chorus 2]
Sing the changes, as you're sleeping
Feel the quiet, feel the thunder
Sing the changes calling over
Feel the quiet, feel the thunder

[Chorus 1]
Like the sun playing in the morning
Feel the quiet, feel the thunder
Every ladder leads to heaven
Colored pencils, draw the picture

[Chorus 3]
Sing your praises as you're sleeping
Feel a sense of childlike wonder

[Chorus 4]
Sing your praises in the city
New York City, here we go now
Feel the thunder, feel the thunder
Hear the people singing over

[Chorus 5]
Feel the sense of childlike wonder
As you're sleeping, feel the thunder
Sing the changes, everybody
Feel the sense of childlike wonder, yeah

[Outro]
Yeah, thank you

[Verse 1]
Stuck inside these four walls
Sent inside forever
Never seeing no one nice again
Like you
Mama, you
Mama, you

[Segue]

[Verse 2]
If I ever get out of here
Thought of giving it all away to a registered charity
All I need is a pint a day if I ever get out of here
If we ever get out of here

[Segue]

[Verse 3]
Well, the rain exploded with a mighty crash
As we fell into the sun
And the first one said to the second one there
"I hope you're having fun"

[Chorus]
Band on the run
Band on the run
And the jailer man and Sailor Sam
Were searching everyone
For the band on the run
Band on the run
For the band on the run
Band on the run

[Verse 4]
Well, the undertaker drew a heavy sigh
Seeing no one else had come
And a bell was ringing in the Village Square
For the rabbits on the run

[Chorus]
Band on the run
Band on the run
And the jailer man and Sailor Sam
Were searching everyone
For the band on the run
Band on the run

Yeah, the band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run

[Verse 5]
Well, the night was falling as the desert world
Began to settle down
In the town they're searching for us everywhere
But we never will be found

[Chorus]
Band on the run
Band on the run
And the County Judge, who held a grudge
Will search forevermore
For the band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run

[Verse 1]
Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

[Verse 1]
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

Wonders how you manage to feed the rest

And you know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another (Ooh)
When I saw her standing there?

Well, she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long
I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (Woo)
When I saw her standing there

[Bridge]
Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another (Woo)
When I saw her standing there

When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Now I'll never dance with another (Woo)
Since I saw her standing there

Yeah, well, since I saw her standing there

Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

[Chorus]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Verse 3]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say

Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

Do you, don't you want me to love you?

I'm throwin' parties all week like Coachella, bitch (Ah)
Rollin' loud on the balcony, watch the set (Uh)
That Rihanna kush (Uh), keep her pussy wet (Wet)
Uh, I'm talkin' to my life like, "You're the best"
Niggas wanna strike, young boy, you don't pose a thread (Nope)
Stones in the safe, all I'm sayin' my paper legit
Niggas wanna say you ain't shit when they know you the shit
If hell froze over, I'm just tryna get the ice Patek
Wealth for my lil' man, royalties on his desk
Runnin' through the hallways, up from the South of France
I'ma count this million, pull up on me 'round ten

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Tyga]
Ayy
Tell your friend she invited (Invited)
And I know she gon' like it (Like it)
Pull up to the gate, it's private (Private)

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Ride with me, baby (Come on)
To the 305, slip and slide with me, baby (Yeah)
Show you when I get inside, all this time we done wasted (Time)
We got Cookies by the flavors and got bottles by the cases
Just like a rookie got a agent, I got bitches by the braces (Yeah)
Takin' jets to different places (Whew), pick up backends on occasions (Cash)
The bigger the mansion, bigger the gate is
The bigger the bad, the bigger the plate is (Big)
I'd rather be rich than famous
The bigger you get, the bigger the hate is
Tell your friends they all invited (Invited)
I'm bringin' my dogs, they bitin' (Hurr)
The room, it sound like a storm
A little bit of thunder, strike out the lightnin' (Boom)
Spicy, know she spicy (Spicy)
Wet-wet like a Pisces (Wet-wet)
Drip, Lil Boosie, bite me (Drip, drip, splash)

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Tyga]

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Slide like we in four

Kush in the jar, lil' baby, we can roll some
Back seat, I'ma beat it up like it stole somethin'
Get it wet, I'ma slide in
All my diamonds dancin', they vibin'
Girl, don't tell nobody, don't be triflin' (Ooh yeah)
Goin' face first, I'ma dive in

Poe Boy
Mail on Sunday the album comin' soon
It's the movement, shorty I see you
I'm a give you this cake...
E'rr day

Hey... My team on the scene full of green full of bling
Got cream in they jeans, tippin' on g-strings
Freaks with tongue rings used to be prom queen with a strut that's me
Shorty you want it you gotta come place your order
And I might invest in two daughters like two quarters
Invest in vitamin water if I adore ya
Drop it on my lap
You can make it clap
Money in the trap of the body tap all like a scout
Run a lap around a pole I'm makin' a stove bank rolls
And the paint glossin'-a but I ain't 'Zo
Lemme know when you ready to get low
Flo Rida spendin' cheddar whatever to get dough dollars holler
Rubberband might pop Franklin's collar
Give it up like I'm bein' jacked by robbers
Ready you ready go 'head undress
All I wanna see is flesh
You the bunny I'm Hef
Playboy with money feed you like a chef
Got beads for your honey, Poe boy I rep
Triple C's Johnny boy let's take it to the Lex
Cocos, diamonds where the charms get wet
Take one bout it might get some neck
20, 000 we breakin' bread

Flo Rida's hotter then technology dirty your knees
Getcha some cheese, girl I'm a G
Help you Succeed, suck seed, babies indeed
Unforgettable special to me
I wanna give it to shorty that tease
Yea, study little mama physique
Yea, my present is -vedababree-

[Chorus:]
Baby this a new age, you like my new craze
Let's get together maybe we can start a new phase
The smokes got the club all hazy, spotlights don't do you justice baby
Why don't you come over here, you got me saying

Ayo, I'm tired of using technology, why don't you sit down on top of me
Ayo, I'm tired of using technology, I need you right in front of me
Ooh, she wants it, uh uh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it, uh uh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it, uh uh (soo), I got to give it to her 

[X2]

Your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you 

[X4]

Shes already fallin in love with my timbs
The best of both worlds
Timberland right I got -Timbalick leff-
Knockin' yo boots gotta step it up girl
I seduce you with loot that I throw in the air
The e-pit the apple my money was there
I love the big apple cause they love a playa
I'm tryin' a put strippers in Madison Square Garden
Like Adam would not litter garden
Tippin' I'm ready to bargain
Break bread witcha get some head witcha
Go to bed witcha get fed witcha get it wet witcha
Come over here girl I'm ready to hug
I ain't gotta cut no more records for what
Now'days how they rappin' always double up
Yet they tryin' sell platinum like diamond too much

Dammit I'm on, I wanna see you in a thong
Henne Petrone, that get the woman in the zone
Shorty your groan then we can get get gone

Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton, Christina Aguilera might swallow my children

Girl go'n back it up -bring shrunk- in that buildin'
Stuntin' when I wanna shorty hot like the summer
Make it drop never wonder where the gwap come fromma
Maybe out the sky if you show me a thigh
Get that -M. O. Witty Y- to afford you a Hummer
I wanna good time, just peek in my mind
That bump and that grind, your rump'd do fine
Can't front you's a dime
Okay, I'm lyin'
Like crooks doin time, my zipper is blind

[Intro]
Use me for your service (For your service)
Here am I, Lord

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Niggas was in that back room
See, I ain't sitting with that
Niggas was hitting that glass tube
Yeah, I ain't fuckin' with that
Auntie was smoking that crack too
My mama was dealin' with that
Big skies out in Corpus
Them lights was so gorgeous
In the garage, I made a fortune
I'm still tryna fuck every Mormon
It's amazing how I'm still searching, y'all
Still reaching, man, fuck the law
Above the law, she above the law
Close the blinds, let the lights go off
Duck low in case they raid us all
And take it all with speed and ease
He like me on my knees
Generational trauma things
I wonder how far I could bring
This shit to my existence, my nigga
Can I get a witness? I lived it
Turn into a vicious, I spit it
Looked at me and rip it, just get it

[Bridge]
You ain't the only one that's searching for that 1-9
You gotta go ahead and let that sun shine

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Everything gon' be okay
I'm 'bout to steal a whip and drive that bitch to Montana
My feelings roll, that's when I throw tantrum
LA, LA, LA road
Everything gon' be okay
I'm 'bout to steal a whip and drive that bitch to Montana
My feelings roll, that's when I throw tantrum
LA, LA, LA road

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I left some ghosts in my mama house
Standing alone with the shell of my past
I probably still should be underground
I know that nobody thought this would last
It's been bigger than the music
When it hits you feel it you don't have to try
Why would I care for your validation
When you couldn't look me in the eyes?
Clutching your purse in elevators
But I wrote your income off on my taxes
They don't want a social commentator
They just wanna hear a nigga rapping
You start to feel a bit of freedom
Then they wanna stop and frisk you in the boardroom
Everybody wanna tell you what you're worth
Until you know your worth and then they can't ignore you
Wait a minute for what you pray for
Halle Salassie, Halleluja
Word to Buddha, Insha'Alla
I've been falling back into the void
Somewhere in-between overjoyed and annoyed
And I can't feel a fuckin' thing
Take a moment just to blink
Take a breath, let it think
Wash my hands, let 'em sink

[Intro]
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1]
I been locked up, hanging out with the wrong crowd
In the streets, only thing that I know how
Don't really know why you put up with me
All these years, I've been chasing this dream
Out of work, hard times, stress on my mind
Not to mention, all the times that I made you cry
You always said I would make it one day
And now I'm so glad I get the chance to say

[Pre-Chorus]
You believed in me baby, you deserve that Mercedes
It don't matter what the cost, you get anything you want
Don't you worry 'bout nothing, nothing
Cause you give me all the love that I need

[Chorus]
You been here from the start
And I appreciate the woman that you are
The only girl with keys to my heart
I wouldn't be the man that I am without ya
(So this is something that I gotta say)
Thanks for holding me down, down, down (Down)
Down, down, down
Thanks for holding me down, down, down (Down)
Down, down, down
Thanks for holding me down

[Verse 2]
I been locked up, shipped out, kicked when I'm down
Laughed at, played out, like I'm some clown
Time goes past, more than a little bit
Didn't phase you, not even a little bit (I know, I know)
The things I put you through (I know, I know)
The things that you would do, for me
You're my guarantee

[Pre-Chorus]
You believed in me baby, you deserve that Mercedes
It don't matter what the cost, you get anything you want
Don't you worry 'bout nothing, nothing
Cause you give me all the love that I need

[Chorus]
You been here from the start
And I appreciate the woman that you are
The only girl with keys to my heart
I wouldn't be the man that I am without ya
(So this is something that I gotta say)
Thanks for holding me down, down, down (Down)
Down, down, down
Thanks for holding me down, down, down (Down)
Down, down, down
Thanks for holding me down

[Verse 3]
What you see in me nobody else could see
Even when I had no faith in where we'd be
Stayed down, like old flat tires
Definition of a rider
Would do it again if you had to
And that's why I love ya

[Chorus x2]
You been here from the start
And I appreciate the woman that you are
The only girl with keys to my heart
I wouldn't be the man that I am without ya
(So this is something that I gotta say)
Thanks for holding me down, down, down (Down)
Down, down, down
Thanks for holding me down, down, down (Down)
Down, down, down
Thanks for holding me down

When I found old diaries from my childhood and my teens, they were covered in dust. I'm not just saying that for poetic effect, they were truly dusty with pictures drawn of first day of school outfits and inspirational quotes I used to retrace over and over to get me through doubtful moments. I'd practice my autograph and tape my guitar picks to the pages. In the entries, I daydreamed on paper and mused about who might ask who to the dance or how nervous I was saying the national anthem at the local baseball game. I frequently and drastically changed my opinions on love, friends, confidence and trust. I vented, described memories in detail, jotted down new song ideas and questioned why I would ever try to shoot for a career I had such a small chance of ever attaining.

But what shocked me the most was how often I wrote down the things I loved. Writing a new song, riding in the car with my mom, the purple-pink skies of the soccer field  on the walk home, the one night in middle school when none of my friends were fighting, the dazzle of opal necklaces I couldn’t afford gleaming from a department store jewelry case. I wrote about tiny details in my life in these diaries from a bygone age with such... wonderment. Intrigue. Romance. I noticed things and decided they were romantic, and so they were.

In life, we grow up and we encounter the nuanced complexities of trying to figure out who to be, how to act, or how to be happy. Like invisible smoke in the room, we wonder what kind of anxiety pushes you forward and what kind ruins your ability to find joy in your life. We constantly question our choices, our surroundings, and we beat ourselves up for our mistakes. All the while, we crave romance. We long for those rare, enchanting moments when things just fall into place. Above all else, we really, really want our lives to be filled with love.

I've decided that in this life, I want to be defined by the things I love- not the things I hate, the things I'm afraid of, or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night. Those things may be struggles, but they're not my identity. I wish the same for you. May your struggles become inaudible background noise behind the loud, clear voices of those who love and appreciate you. Turn those voices up in the mix in your head. May you take notice of the things in your life that are nice and make you feel safe and maybe even find wonderment in them. May you write down your feelings and reflect on them years later, only to learn all the trials and the tribulations you thought might kill you... didn't. I hope that someday you forget the pain ever existed. I hope that if there is a lover in your life, it's someone who deserves you. If that's the case, I hope you treat them with care.

This album is a love letter to love itself- all the captivating, spellbinding, maddening devastating red, blue, gray, golden aspects of it (that's why there are so many songs).
In honor of fever dreams, bad boys, confessions of love on a drunken night out, Christmas lights still hanging in January, guitar string scars on my hands, false gods and blind faith, memories of jumping into an icy outdoor pool, creaks in floorboards and ultraviolet morning light, finally finding a friend, and opening the curtains to see the clearest, brightest daylight after the darkest night.

We are what we love.
This is Lover.

[SNIPPET]

[Intro]
{growling}
It's the real shit right here baby
Ya'meen? Ya'meen?
It ain't like I don't do this, ya'meen?
It ain't like I don't always spit the truth every motherfucking way baby!

[Verse 1]
Have you ever got up smiling, laid down crying
First you love life then wish you were dying
Been so fed up you gave up trying
Kept it straight up but niggas kept lying
Ever seen something that you wanted so bad
And got it then wished it was something you never had
You ever been so lost than you thought you won't make it
If you ever been forced to do something you couldn't take it
You ever felt so strong for so long
But when it came down to it, turned out to be so wrong
Wake yourself up like, where did I go wrong!?
Just get back up, pray on it and go on

[Chorus]
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it

[Verse 2]
Have you ever wanted to go right, but then chose left
Deep down with a lift to way shows death
Burn in the night but everyday shows stress
Regardless of what you think I'm going in that
Have you ever wished upon a star that really wasn't there
Gaze so in your heart, but really didn't care
Found out at the wrong time that life wasn't fair
And all you can do is take it, like ye
Have you ever found out that the shit you was in was really
Deeper, cause to me is tryin' to creep ya
Back your Glock off put your ass in a sleeper
Used to be my dog, now he's the Grim Reaper

[Chorus]
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it

[Bridge]
Ever seen something that you didn't want to see
Had to be something that you didn't want to be
Had to kill a nigga that looked just like me
Wanted to believe to have a trust like me

[Chorus]
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it

[Spoken Intro]
So the clip that you're about to hear is my preparation for a writing session. I was writing with two writers I hadn't ever worked with before, so I wanted to come in with an idea that was pretty much all there, melody and lyrics. And so I had this idea called "I Forgot That You Existed", and I wanted it to be really simple. I thought it might be a really fun way to open the album, like, basically kind of shrugging off a lot of things that you've been through that have been causing a lot of struggle and pain and just, one day, you wake up and you realize you're indifferent to whatever caused you that pain. And so this is a clip of me just trying to tinkering around on the piano, trying to figure out what I wanted to do with it, and you can hear the end result on the album, but this is where it started

[Sung]
I forgot that you existed
Thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice

(Humming)
I forgot that you existed
I forgot that you existed
Thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice

I forgot that you existed
How I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and

How many nights I, how you did me
How many days did I wait thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
(Humming)
I forgot that you existed
I thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed

[Spoken]
Writing the song "Lover" was one of those magical experiences that you sometimes get to have as a songwriter. Um, I wrote it really quick in the middle of the night. As soon as I wrote it, I knew I wanted it to be the album title. And I knew that writing it kinda would depict the tone of the entire record
So it was a real catalyst for what this album turned into
And I wrote it alone, so I wanted to go in and play it for Jack Antonoff who I knew who would be the perfect person to produce it. And so I walked into the studio and I sat in the piano
And this is what happened

So it is, it's basically, I don't see it as a piano. I think it's that like, kinda of, dreamy, guitary, throwback, but not like camp throwback, so

[Sung: Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

[Sung: Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Spoken]
Yeah, I love the walk down
I love the walk down
I was trying to figure out "what the hell is gonna happen there"
So the, so

[Sung]
My, my, my, my lover

[Sung: Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash on the couches
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[Sung: Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Spoken]
Okay and then I have this bridge thing that's um, essentially
Well, no I was
I did, I did it in this key
But it could be like a thing where's like a key change
So it plays off of the walk down-ish
But it's, this is the melody of it, it goes, it's like

[Sung: Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hands
I take this magnetic force-
Oh, fuck
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

[Spoken]
Wait so goes like

[Sung: Bridge]
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat

[Spoken]
So goes, and you, it goes

[Sung: Bridge]
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
My heart's been borrowed your heart's been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat

[Spoken]
You like? Yeah! I've never, I never do these cords, but, I was really at the piano, like, hashing it out yesterday
Yeah, it's a New York thing, aight?
Swizz, what up? Bus, what up?
Double R, what up? Bloodline, what up?
D-Block, what up?
Yeah! It's nothing! Nothing!
Aight? That's how we do
Awww!

[Verse]
Between me and you, I'd be in the dark for too long
Bark is too strong, hot light is on
Whatever it's gon' be, that's what it is
I didn't stutter, motherfucka, put that on your kids
Built for war, built for raw
Built for more, built from it all for the dog to the floor
I've been getting down before I knew what getting down was
Shit, I just do what a real nigga does
Get anything straight up
If shit starts falling apart, wait up, let's get this joint paid up
So it's square one, and a nigga can't get a fair one at
Any time of the day, but a nigga can run
Keep shit moving, doing what the fuck we be doin'
They're coming to 'em, but I'm running through 'em
I don't need the headache of a bitch talking me to death
But I'll fuck me to death; what the fuck we got left?
I don't want nothing, but some fucking pussy
I ain't trying to be all cuddled up, when all talking getting mushy
Been there, done that, with that one back there
From when there was none of that to when there was some of that
Niggas still come back, hood for life
Shit, quiet as a cat nigga, hood's my wife

[?] for the night, that's what it be
Or if its good for tomorrow cause tomorrow we'll see
Take it one day at a time, my end's in the street

[Intro]
(Jesus loves me, yes I know)
Our Father, who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy Name, thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
(For the Bible tells me so)
On earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses
(Jesus loves me, Yes I know)
As we forgive those who trespass against us
(Jesus loves me)
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil
(Jesus loves me)
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory
For ever and ever. Amen

[Verse 1]
Jesus loves me, he told me so. That's why when it gets ugly
He hugs me, 'cause he knows me, yo
Ya gotta let go and let God, sometimes from the get go ya go hard
It's like, the darker it gets, the brighter my light will shine
So regardless I'm lovin' this life of mine
And with the Lord by my side, it don't matter what the call of life
Cause let me in, 'cause I was going for the ride
Ain't blind, ain't gotta see to believe it
I just know you gave me the word and that I really need it
So I pray for my enemies, I pray for family, my friends, my loved ones and those who pretend to be
Sacrifice your son just to give me a chance
So I thank you for the plan, I thank you for your hand
Shepherd, watching over your flock of sheep
But I'm good, cause you watchin' the dark when I'm sleep

[Hook]
Jesus loves me, yes I know
For the Bible tells me so (and I believe it in my soul)
Jesus loves me, yes I know (Oh yeah)
For the Bible tells me so (and I believe it in my soul)

[Verse 2]
Speaking of the word, it's sad that not all get it
But by the grace of God, I was born with it, come on get it
Jesus loved me from the beginning, that's why sometimes
Even though it looks like I'm losing, I'm still winning
But I ain't never been blind, never gonna sign
Never been one to let the Devil know what's on my mind
'Cause he wants to destroy ya, but the Lord will resurrect ya
If ya hug the little boy, then the man will protect ya
From the dark to the light, right to the wrong
I'm gonna stay up in this fight, from the night till the morn
Well as I'm in the grace of God, my heart will stay true
And I'm gonna do whatever the heart will say do with it
When things go wrong, Jesus loves me
I'm singing this song because Jesus loves me
I'm gonna be strong cause Jesus loves me
Jesus loves me, yes, Jesus loves me

[Hook]
Jesus loves me, yes I know
For the Bible tells me so (and I believe it in my soul)
Jesus loves me, yes I know (Oh yeah)
For the Bible tells me so (and I believe it in my soul)

[Outro]
Now clap your hands with me (uh huh, uh huh)
And stomp your feet with me (come on, come on)
And bob your head with me (uh huh, uh huh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Not because my daddy told me (NO)
Not because my preacher showed me (NO)
Gotta feel it in my soul!

Not because my teacher taught me (NO)

Gotta feel it in my soul! (I feel it in my soul!)

You know I need my medicine
I'm sick when you ain't around, you keep me alive

[Bridge 1]
My heart's racing 'til I hear from you
And I don't know what to do
I'm almost home halfway 'cross town
But I'll turn back around
If you need me to, I'll come get you
If you don't wanna drive
And that I'll leave the door open
Just come inside

[Chorus]
All night long

Take our time, we gon' be all night

Take our time, we can go all night

Waited all night long to hear you moan
Baby bring it on
Waited all night long
Waited all night long for your love

[Verse 2]
I'm so glad you're here and taking off your clothes
Take it off slow
Lay your precious body down right here beside me, girl
I wanna play

[Bridge 2]
I'm all wrapped up in pleasing you
There's nothing I won't do
If it keeps you satisfied, I'll try
At least a time or two
You're the only one that keeps me coming
Coming back for more
There's just something about your loving
I love to explore

[Chorus]
All night long
(It's just me and you, girl)
Take our time, we gon' be all night
(All night, all night)
We go, all night long

[Chorus]
All night long
(It's just me and you, girl)
Take our time, we gon' be all night
We go, all night long

Take our time, we can go all night

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
They tell you while you're young
"Girls, go out and have your fun"
Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it
Criticize the way you fly
When you're soaring through the sky
Shoot you down and then they sigh
And say, "She looks like she's been through it"
Lord, what will become of me
Once I've lost my novelty?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I've had too much to drink tonight
And I know it's sad but this is what I think about
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me when I'm nothing new?

[Verse 2: Phoebe Bridgers & Taylor Swift]
How long will it be cute, all this crying in my room?
When you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention
And someone else lights up the room? (Ahh)
People love an ingénue (Ahh)

[Chorus: Phoebe Bridgers & Taylor Swift]
I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
How did I go from growing up to breaking down?
And I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me when I'm nothing new?

[Bridge: Taylor Swift &  Phoebe Bridgers]
I know someday I'm gonna meet her
It's a fever dream
The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen
She'll know the way and then she'll say she got the map from me
I'll say I'm happy for her then I'll cry myself to sleep
Oh woah ohh, oh woah ohh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Phoebe Bridgers]
I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
But I wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out
I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night
And I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me, will you still want me
Will you still want me when I'm nothing new?

Didn’t take my diamonds off, jumped in the moshpit
I’m with lil set in the hood, I feel safer
I used to fuck dirty bitches out the Mayfair
Ten chocolate hoes and ten vanilla wafers
Ten unannounced the mixed sprees, scorin’ tho
Put em’ on Molly, got these bitches hoein’
Put em’ on Molly, got these bitches goin’
Put em’ on Molly, get that hoe away she blowin’ up my phone, asking’ where I’m goin’
Ask her where the drugs, she say “Coke?”
Nah this shit snorin’, scorin’ like I’m Jordan
They say “where you been?” Nah, where I’m goin’?
Been in that cut like a bum, but I’m still here
I watched the game but my vision is still clear
Look in the mirror, my neck, chandelier
Oh, I got a slut, she don’t want to leave
Take care of her fees and she gon’ go HAM
Make sure she ain’t hot like NBA JAM
She can’t be on fire, I read about it in the Esquire
That’s how you bring down the umpire
Make sure she clean before she get hired
Fuck her from the back and then she get fired
Fuck that, I’m back in this bitch and I’m here to stay
They didn’t give me credit for my shit
So I get my credit another way
I’m writing this shit for your favorite rapper
Gettin shit gone like a street trapper
They found out it’s me, that’s a knee slapper
Stop doubting me, all your shit done
Stop doubting me, I’m the jump starter
Raise up the guap like a Kickstarter
I want to touch on the Stalion
I just need a second, I’ll hit from the back, boy I know it’s a blessing
I just made a confession, I didn’t mean to do it
But I get into it, I’m really intuitive
All of the moves that I make they be lucrative
I will not liquidate
I’m with this black bitch, thick like a milkshake
Clap like an earthquake
Stop with the rapping, just do it for (?) sake
I’m in my bag like a (?) plate
Stick to the money that shit be my soulmate
Posted with the gang on the block at the home base
I’m gettin head, that shit straight like a front lace
Eat up the (?), babygirl tell them how that taste

[Outro:]
Yea

[Verse 1]
Step out into the dawn
You pray 'til, you pray 'til the lights come on
And then you feel like you've just been born
Yeah, you come to raise me up
When I'm beaten and broken up
And now I'm back in the arms I love

[Pre-Chorus]
And I think I just died
I think I just died
Yeah, I think I just died

[Chorus]
And went to Heaven
And went to Heaven

I think I just died and went to Heaven

And now you've c-come to raise me up

Yeah, I think I just died

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
It's no slip of the tongue
So let it all out, let it all out
Don't you act like you're stunned
It didn't all come from me
Did it all come from me?
I'm red, I'm raring, I'm out of breath
Your burning stare holding down my chest, chest

[Chorus]
So if this is love, love, love
Then why do you
You even bother?

[Verse 2]
Piercing words script the night
Then you force me to the floor
You pull me to the floor
But you won't see inside
This beating head, this wailing head

[Chorus]
So if this is love, love, love
Then why do you
You even bother?

[Verse 1]
Fear fun, fear love
Fresh out of fs, forever
Tryin' to be stronger for you
Ice cream, ice queen
I dream in jeans and leather
Life's dream, I'm sweet for you

[Chorus]
Oh God, miss you on my lips
It's me, your little Venice chick
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss

[Post-Chorus]
You're in the yard, I light the fire
And as the summer fades away
Nothing gold can stay
You write, I tour, we make it work
You're beautiful and I'm insane
We're American-made

[Verse 2]
Give me Hallmark
One dream, one life, one lover
Paint me happy in blue
Norman Rockwell
No hype under our covers
It's just me and you

[Chorus]
Oh God, miss you on my lips
It's me, your little Venice chick
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss

[Post-Chorus]
You're in the yard, I light the fire
And as the summer fades away
Nothing gold can stay
You write, I tour, we make it work
You're beautiful and I'm insane
We're American-made

[Outro]
Signin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss
Signin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss

[Intro]
All the ladies to the dance, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Left the roof off, I'm a winner
Now my neck froze, I'm a winner
We could go up with the lights down low
Girl, it's too hot to keep on these clothes
Pum pum shorts with the Louis
Whine up your waist and we Gucci
Only came out to run into you
First thing I noticed

[Pre-Chorus]
Is that you came to the club in the taxi
But I'm sure you preferred a Rolls
So we can get changed in the backseat
'Cause it's summertime and you know

[Chorus]
It's too hot for clothes
Too hot for clothes
Too hot for clothes
Na na na, too hot, too hot
Baby, it's too hot for clothes
Too hot for clothes
Too hot for clothes
Na na na, too hot, too hot

[Verse 2]
Been around the world and I-ay-ay
Ain't never seen a pengting, ting so fly
I bet you dance in the mirror like boop-ba-ba-doop
All alone with you, tempted to touch
Red and vodka that new, new, new, new
That's all I drink, I'm gon' chase it wit' you
Clothes are scattered around on the floor
But all I remember is

[Pre-Chorus]
Is that you came to the club in the taxi
But I'm sure you preferred a Rolls (Oh yeah)
So we can get changed in the backseat
'Cause it's summertime and you know

[Chorus]
It's too hot for clothes
Too hot for clothes (I said it's too)
Too hot for clothes (Too)
Na na na, too hot, too hot
Baby, it's too hot for clothes (Take it off girl)
Too hot for clothes ('Cause it's)

[Gang of Youths]
Older brother, restless soul, lie down
Lie for a while with your ear against the earth
And you’ll hear your sister sleep talking
Say, “Your hair is long but not long enough to reach
Home to me
But your beard
Someday might be”

And she woke up in a cold sweat on the floor
Next to a family portrait drawn when you were four
And beside a jar of two-cent coins that are no good no more
She’ll lay it aside

{Mumford & Sons]
Older father, weary soul, you’ll drive
Out to the home you made on the mountainside
With that ugly, terrible thing
Those papers for divorce
And a lonely ring
A lonely ring
Sit on your porch
And pluck your strings
And you’ll find somebody you can blame
And you’ll follow the creek that runs out into the sea
And you’ll find the peace of the Lord

[Gang of Youths]
Grandfather, weary soul, you’ll fly
Over your life once more before you die
Since our grandma passed away
You’ve waited for forever and a day
Just to die
And someday soon
You will die

[Gang of Youths - Mumford & Sons]
Oh the only woman you ever loved
She got burnt by the sun too often when she was young
And the cancer spread and ran into her body and her blood
And there’s nothing that you can do about it now
How many roads must a man walk down
Before they call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
How many times must those cannonballs be fired
Before they're forever banned?

Let me tell you that the answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

How many years can the mountain exist
Before it's washed to the sea?
How many years can a man, can a man exist
Before he's allowed to be free?
How many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?

The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

The answer is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Sing it louder
Sing it louder
The answer is blowin'
The answer is in the wind
The answer is blowin'
It's blowin'
It's blowin'
It's blowin'
The answer is blowin'
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'm not the one you need
You say you're looking for someone
Who is never weak, but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door
But it ain't me, babe
No no no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're looking for, babe

Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'll only let you down
You say you're looking for someone
Who will promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone to die for you and more
But it ain't me, babe
No no no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're looking for, babe
You say you're looking for someone
To pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call
A lover for your life and nothing more
But it ain't me, babe
No no no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're looking for, babe

[Hook]
Shame on me for loving you

You lie so sweet but you love to tease
You're putting out fire with your gasoline
Uh-dut-dut-dut, dut-up

[Verse 1]
Let's get out of this town, baby, we're on fire
Everyone around here seems to be going down, down, down
If you stick with me, I can take you higher and higher
It feels like all of our friends are lost
Nobody's found, found, found
I got so scared, I thought no one could save me
You came along, scooped me up like a baby

[Chorus]
Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?
Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face, and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time

[Verse 2]
Boy, get into my car, got a bad desire
You know that we'll never leave if we don't get out now, now, now
You're a careless con and you're a crazy liar, but baby
Nobody can compare to the way you get down, down, down
I tried so hard to act nice like a lady
You taught me that it was good to be crazy

[Chorus]
Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?
Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face, and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time

[Bridge]
Feels like, feels like, you know it feels like
Falling in love for the first time
Feels like, you know it feels like
Falling in love

[Chorus]
Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?
Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face, and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time
Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be, yeah, you and me are the lucky ones this time?

[Chorus]
Oh baby

Who's that walkin' around?
Go sit, sounds like baby patter to me

[?]

[Verse 1]
Say, up in Harlem at a table for two
There were four of us: me, your big feet, and you
From your ankle up, I'll say you sure are sweet
From there down there's just too much feet

Yes, your feet's too big
Don't want you 'cause you feet's too big
Can't use you 'cause you feet's too big
I really hate you 'cause your feet's too big

She said likes your face, she likes your array
Man, oh man, them things are too big

Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
Gotta hear it again today

[Verse 2: George Harrison]
You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart's beating rhythm
And my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues (Woo)
I think I caught the arthritis
Sitting down by the rhythm revue
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two

[Verse 4: George Harrison]
Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just a trifle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two (Woo)

[Verse 5: George Harrison]
Well early in the morning
I'm a-giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle

Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see 'em reel and rock
Long as she got a dime
The music will never stop

Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Dig to these rhythm and blues

I found it out, what love is all about
And every day, it sure lets out

'Cause nothin's shakin' but the leaves on the tree
My papi told me there'd be times like these
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees

[Verse 2: George Harrison]
We meet the gang and go to rockin' Joe's
The cats are something on the heels and toes
I grab my baby, tried to give her a squeeze
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
Well why must she be such a dog-gone tease?
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees

[Pre-Chorus: George Harrison]
She's got a way that makes me act like a fool
Spent my money, then she plays me cool
I'm beggin' for her kisses on a bended knee
Oh, won't you give me some-a lovin', baby
Please, please, please

[Chorus: George Harrison]
Though I keep trying hard to make her mine
One day the wind will blow, the sun will shine
Till that time, she puts my heart at ease
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart and threw away the keys
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees, yeah

Good evening, sir, how are you?

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
I got lumps in my throat
When I saw her comin' down the aisle
I got the wiggles in my knees
When she looked at me and sweetly smiled
There she is again
Standing over by the record machine
Yeah, she's lookin' like a model on the cover of a magazine
She's too cute to be a minute over seventeen

[Pre-Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Meanwhile, I was thinking
She's in the mood, no need to break it
I got the chance, I oughta take it
If she'll dance, then we can make it
Come on, Queenie, let's shake it

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Go, go, go, little Queenie
Go, go, go, little Queenie
I said, Go, go, go, little Queenie
Ahh, go, go, go, go!

Well, there she is a-dancin'
Over by the record machine
Lookin' like a model on the cover of a magazine
Yeah, she's too cute to be a minute over seventeen

[Pre-Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Meanwhile, well, she's thinkin'
If it's a slow song, we'll omit it
If it's a rocker, I'm gonna get it
And if it's good, she'll admit it
Said, c'mon queenie, Ahh

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Queenie, Go! Go, go, queenie
Go, go, go, little queenie
Go, go, go, little queenie
Ahh!

She's in the mood, no need to break it
I got the chance, I oughta take it
If she'll dance, then we can make it

Now you're mine, my happiness still makes me cry
And in time, you'll understand the reason why
If I cry it's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had

I can't conceive of any more—misery

[Verse 2]
When I call her on the telephone
She says, "Baby, I'm all alone"
Before the time I count from one to four
She'll be knocking on my door

Every evening when the sun goes down
And there ain't nobody else around
She kisses me and then she holds me tight
"Hey baby, everything's alright"
That's why I know, yes I know

Hallelujah, I love her so
Hallelujah, I just love that chick so

I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
One, two, three, four

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you're the best

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the mornin' sky
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone, I'm gonna drive, drive, drive

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Intro]
Aw baby, how you doin'?
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase, huh?
Some women were made...
But me, myself?
I like to think that I was created
For a special purpose
And, uh
What's more special than you?
You feel me?

[Verse 1]
It's on, baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why?
Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

[Chorus]
It's too big (Big)
It's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong)
It won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much)
It's too tough (Tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego
It's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up

[Verse 2]
Usually I'm humble
Right now, I don't choose
You can leave with me
Or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant
I call it confident
You decide when you find out what I'm working with
Damn, I know
I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs
Matter of fact it's my smile, or maybe my eyes?
Boy, you a sight to see
Kinda something like me

[Chorus]
It's too big (Big)
It's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong)
It won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much)
It's too tough (Tough)
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I got a big ego
Such a huge ego
But, he loves my big ego
It's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up

[Hook]
I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I, I can back it up
I can back it up
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up

[Chorus]
It's too big (Big)
It's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong)
It won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much)
It's too tough (Tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego
Such a huge ego (Such a huge ego)
But, I love his big ego
It's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up

[Bridge]
Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, you ain't know?
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano...
Whoa...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-woah-woah
Woah-woah-woah
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woo...

[Outro]
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh

[Intro: Big Sean & DJ Khaled]
Woah, oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah (This is)
Doing what I gotta do, aaaa
What up though?
We the best music
Oh, I guess I'm on my Don shit
What that mean?
I'ma go, aaaa
DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Straight up, late nights mixed with early days
It'll probably be that way until the pearly gates (straight up)
Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break
These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man (sheesh)
'Least if you real then I have to respect it
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested (yep)
So understand we positive as could be
The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats
Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach (beach)
Khaled on the jet skis, preaching what you believe in (brr)
Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating
If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan
Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers
You know it's true, bitch I need respect due
Now or later, either way I'ma take it
Just like it's fuckin' taxes
You made it up while we made it happen
I kill shit to just kill time, no chill time
In the field on time every time like it's drill time
I took a break from my girl so she still fine
Took a break from the game, but it's still mine
Got my big break, now we tryna break the records
These niggas couldn't take the pressure that I ate for breakfast
Pretty girls showin' love like I'm David Beckham
The takeover will only take a second, straight up

[Chorus: Betty Wright & DJ Khaled]
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust (uh huh)
Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (come on)
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said "Fuck Mother Earth," that's PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubik's cube
So what you look up to?
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches
Sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Two new Royce's with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason
You won't die in peace
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me
Tape recording my voices and tweak it
Let's play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast
I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD
Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need
Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration
But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix

[Chorus: Betty Wright & DJ Khaled]
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key

[Outro: Betty Wright]
Holy, holy key, holy

One night, one night I was layin' down, oh Lord
Could hear my mama an' papa talkin' an' all
I hear them say, you gotta let that boy boogie woogie
'Cause it's in him, it's got to come out
It felt so good
I think I've been boogin' just the same, yes, I have, whoa yeah

Well, mama's been talkin', papa did too
Way that you move, 't's too good for you
Gotta boogie mama, whoa-ooh-oh-ooh
A-boogie, mama
Boogie all night long
I told my baby late last night
The way that you move, can't sing it right, oh
Hey, oh
They were boogin' all night long

Ooh, yeah
Ah ah, yeah
Oh
I believe my mind's gone
Believe I'm fixin' to die
I've been in my mind, y'all
Believe I'm fixin' to die

Said I don't mind, darlin'
But I came to see my children cry
Said my baby, oh, let me outta there
Oh, take me, baby baby baby
All right, baby, little girl
If you can roll it, keep on goin' till I'm deal
Ooh, yeah

That's all right, mama
That's all right for you
That's all right, mama
Any way will set for you
Well, that's all right
Well, that's all right
Well, that's all right
Mama mama, any way you do
I took that ...
That meant twenty-one
C'mon baby
We're gonna have some fun
But, that's all right
But, that's all right
But, that's all right
Ma ma ma, any way you do, ah babe

I'm teasin', teasin', teasin'
Teasin', teasin', teasin'
Teasin', teasin', teasin'
Well, he's a-wrong
Well, he's a-wrong
Well, that's all wrong, ma ma ma ma
Any way you do
Yes, that's all right, ma ma
Any way you do

I just got your letter baby
Too bad you can't come home
I swear I'm goin' crazy
Sittin' here all alone
Since you're gone
I got a mess of blues

I ain't slept a week since Sunday
I can't eat a thing all day
A-every day is just blue Monday
Since you've been away
Since you're gone, ah gone
I got a mess of blues

Whoops, there goes a teardrop
Rollin' down my face
If you cry when you're in love
Baby, it ain't no disgrace
I gotta get myself together
Before I lose my mind
I'm gonna catch the next train goin'
And leave my blues behind
Since you're gone, gone, gone
I got a mess of blues, yeah
Since you're gone
I got a mess of blues
Oh baby, since you're gone-one
I got a mess of blues

Said I hear what I'm saying
Way down inside, you really need
Oh

Shake for me girl
I wanna be your back door man
My baby
Oh yeah

Keep a-coolin, baby
Keep a-coolin, baby
Keep a-coolin, baby
Keep a-coolin, baby

Ah ah
Ah ah

[Verse 1]
I like to see everything in neon
Drink lime green, stay up 'til dawn
Maybe the way that I'm living is killing me
I like to light up the stage with a song
Do shit to keep me turned on
But one day I woke up like
"Maybe I'll do it differently"

[Pre-Chorus]
So I moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
It turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that's not a lie
Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
It's killing me slowly

[Chorus]
Dream a little dream of me
Make me into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
I love you
I love you
I love you
I really do

[Verse 2]
I used to shoot up my veins in neon
And shit's even brighter; you're gone
So many things I would say to you
I want you

[Pre-Chorus]
You moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
And you know everyone adores you
You can't feel it and you're tired
Baby, wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
But it's killing me slowly

[Chorus]
Dream a little dream of me
Turn this into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
I love you
I love you
I love you
I really do

[Bridge]
It turns out California's more than just a state of mind
I met you on the boulevard, wind through my hair, you blew my mind
And if I wasn't so fucked up, I think I'd fuck you all the time
(I really do)
It's killing me slowly

[Chorus]
I love you (I moved to California, but it's just a state of mind)
I love you (It turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that's not a lie)
I love you (Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine)
I really do (It's killing me slowly)

[Outro]
(I love you)
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(I love you)
Chances in my veins, running out of time
(I love you)
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(I really do)
Chances in my veins, running out of time
(I love you)
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(I love you)
Chances in my veins, running out of time
(I love you)
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(I really do)
Chances in my veins, running out of time
"There must be some way out of here"
Said the joker to the thief
"There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth"

"No reason to get excited"
The thief, he kindly spoke
"There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late"

All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside, in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl

[Verse 1]
Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon
There is no sense in trying

[Verse 2]
Pointed threats they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fools gold mouthpiece the hollow horn
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
That he not busy being born
Is busy dying

[Verse 3]
Temptation's page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan, but unlike before
You discover that you'd just be one more
Person crying

[Chorus]
So don't fear, if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing

[Verse 4]
As some warn victory, some downfall
Private reasons, great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don't hate nothing at all
Except hatred

[Verse 5]
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Make everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It's easy to see without lookin' too far
That not much is really sacred

[Verse 6]
Preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the President of the United States
Sometimes must have to stand naked

[Chorus]
Though the rules of the road have been lodged
It's people's games that you've got to dodge
And it's alright, Ma, I can make it

[Verse 7]
Advertising signs that con
You into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
Meantime, life outside goes on
All around you

[Verse 8]
You lose yourself and then you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand, with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
Somebody thinks they really have found you

[Verse 9]
A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not forget
That it is not he, or she, or them, or it
That you belong to

[Chorus]
Though the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to

[Verse 10]
Old lady judges watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn't talk, it swears
Obscenity, who really cares
Propaganda, all is phony

[Verse 11]
While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon 'em naturally
Life sometimes must get lonely

[Verse 12]
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
At pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Tell, alright, I've had enough
What else can you show me?

[Chorus]
And if my thought-dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only

[Roger McGuinn: Verse]
Crimson flames tied through my ears
Rolling high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
“We’ll meet on edges, soon,” said I
Proud 'neath heated brow

[Refrain]
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

[Tom Petty: Verse]
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
“Rip down all hate,” I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow

[Refrain]
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

[Neil Young: Verse]
Girls’ faces formed the forward path
From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists
Un-thought of, though, somehow

[Refrain]
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

[Eric Clapton: Guitar Solo]

[Eric Clapton: Verse]
A self-ordained professor’s tongue
Too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school
“Equality,” I spoke the word
As if a wedding vow

[Refrain]
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

[Bob Dylan: Verse]
In a soldier’s stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I’d become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
My existence led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow

[Refrain]
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

[George Harrison: Verse]
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow

[Refrain]
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

[Neil Young: Guitar Solo]

[Refrain]
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now
Any time that you want, I know
How it feels when outside I go
I sleep
With tears all around

Anyway, you're the one I see
What d'you feel you've done to me?
I feel blue sway
Blue sway
All day, blue sway, now

Blue sway
Blue sway
All day, blue sway, now

Any time that you want, I know
How it feels when outside I go
Blue sway
With tears all around

Anyway, you're the one I see
What d'you feel you've done to me?
I feel blue sway
Blue sway
All day, blue sway, now
Blue sway
Blue sway
All day, blue sway, now
Mama take this badge off of me
I can't use it anymore
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door

Mama wipe the blood from my hands
I can't see through it anymore
Long black train is heading on down
I feel like I'm knockin' on heavne's door

Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door

[Verse 1]
I resign myself to a strange sensation
Of wanting somebody that I can't have
I wish I could believe you relieve my tension
By telling me something I want to hear
But you won't
Will you?

[Chorus]
So I might be a little melancholy
So I might be a little melancholy

[Verse 2]
I resign myself to a day of frustration
I can't help the feelings that I found
Your sentimental touch fills my hear with elation
Are we gonna kick this off the ground?

[Chorus]
So I might be a little melancholy
So I might be a little melancholy

[Reprise]
I resign myself to a day of frustration
I can't hide the feelings that I found
And you aren't gonna help me, are you?

[Chorus]
So I might be a little melancholy
So I might be a little melancholy
So I might be a little melancholy
So I might be a little melancholy
So I might be a little melancholy

[Verse 1]
What is your angle
Well I hear your 

[view?]
I know that you whisper with
The minds that think like you
A mystery lived and breathed
From the day that I could see
Even I've no concept
Of the rage inside of me

[Bridge]
Sweet as the comfort of my
Everlasting peace
Know about religion
Just me and my beliefs
I was my 

[light?]
And now I am my 

[word/world?]

[Chorus]
And I've no desire to share my life
With little tin buddhas

[Verse 2]
Ask me your questions
Take me as you will
No thought can be sacred now
So sacrifice your kill
I see more fear in you
Than I breed within myself
Do you possess existence
And call it something else?

[Bridge]
Sweet as the comfort of my
Realizing 

[well?]
A misguided trust
Of those who are not
Of this world
I was my 

[light?]
And now I am my 

[world?]

[Chorus]
And I've no desire to share my life
With little tin buddhas
And I've no desire to share my life
With little tin buddhas

[Verse 1]
So I'm a sinner
Isn't everyone?
Everybody wants to be the god they love
I've seen sweet heaven turn into something else
But I've seen sweet heaven

If it gets you by it's precious
But one thing's playing on my mind

[Chorus]
All this madness
That's out of nowhere
Your confessions are best untold
I can't leave you now or ever
My resolution has been sold

[Verse 2]
Heroes and heroines embrace in the sun
Blind lead the blind as the sighted run
They've seen sweet heaven turn into something else
But they've seen sweet heaven
She could be my drink or poison
But here's what's playing on my mind

[Chorus]
All this madness out of nowhere
Your confessions are best untold
I can't leave you now or ever
My resolution has been sold

[Chorus]
All this madness out of nowhere
Your confessions are best untold
I can't leave you now or ever
My resolution has been sold

[Verse 1]
So I'm a sinner
Isn't everyone?
Everybody wants to be the god they love
I've seen sweet heaven turn into something else
But I've seen sweet heaven

If it gets you by it's precious
But one thing's playing on my mind

[Chorus]
All this madness
That's out of nowhere
Your confessions are best untold
I can't leave you now or ever
My resolution has been sold

[Verse 2]
Heroes and heroines embrace in the sun
Blind lead the blind as the sighted run
They've seen sweet heaven turn into something else, oh
But they've seen sweet heaven
She could be my drink or poison
But here's what's playing on my mind

[Chorus]
All this madness out of nowhere
Your confessions are best untold
I can't leave you now or ever
My resolution has been sold

[Chorus]
All this madness out of nowhere
Your confessions are best untold
I can't leave you now or ever
My resolution has been sold

[Verse 1]
I resign myself to a strange sensation
Of wanting somebody that I can't have
I wish I could believe you relieve my tension
By telling me something I want to hear

Are we gonna kick this off the ground?

And you aren't gonna help me, are you?

[Chorus]
So I might be a little melancholy
So I might be a little melancholy
So I might be a little melancholy
So I might be a little melancholy
So I might be a little melancholy

[Verse 1]
You take me over hither

[?] to meet your ex-lover
You let me out of your box every other day
Once upon a month
I used to be a lover in love with you
Now I'm in chains

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, I'm just here
And I'm happier than you could ever imagine
Now, I'm here
And I'm happy for being a dreamer

Hey
Nobody told me it would be like this
Hey
Something's gotta be like this

[Chorus]
Nothing getting better and nothing ever changes
Had a bad day all week, but I guess you knew about it
Nothing's getting better and nothing ever changes
Had a bad day all week
Had a bad day all week
Ah-ah-ah-oh

[Verse 2]
You don't deserve to be writ

[?] about, you're so being
I can't bring myself to say your name
I stopped calling you long ago
And I'm so happy now you'd never know

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, I'm just here
And I'm happier than you could ever imagine
Now, I'm here
And I happy for being a dreamer

Hey
Some things will never be the same
Hey
I'm sick and tired of your singing, singing

[Chorus]
Nothing's getting better and nothing ever changes
Had a bad day all week, but I guess you knew about it
Nothing's getting better and nothing ever changes
Had a bad day all week
Had a bad day all week
Ah-ah-ah-oh

Nothing's getting better and nothing ever changes
Had a bad day all week, but I guess you knew about it
Nothing's getting better and nothing ever changes
Had a bad day all week
Had a bad day all week

Ah-ah-ah-oh

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
It's such a shame, but I'm leaving (Uh)
Can't take the way you mistreated me (Uh)
And it's crazy, but oh, baby (Come on, yo, uh, uh, uh)
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me
I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby, let's talk about this, man

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
Well, I'm bouncing and I'm out, son (What you want, baby?)
I gotta leave you alone (Come on now)
'Cause I'm good, holding down my spot
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block (Don't go, baby)
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right? (Come on, baby)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
The nights I waited up for you (Oh, boy)
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you (Uh, uh, uh)
It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settling down
Especially me, I was creepin' all over town (Creepin')
I thought my tender touch could lock you down (Yeah)
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds
That's the way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you angry, come here, I'll prove it now (Come here)
Stop playing (Haha, aw), you gaming
I gotta leave you alone (What you want now?)

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
'Cause I'm good holding my spot
Stop acting like that
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block
Now you know you need to stop
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right?
Here we go

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

[Verse 3: LL Cool J & Jennifer Lopez]
People make mistakes to make up, to break up, to wake up
Cold and lonely, chill, baby, you know me, you love me (Oh)
I'm like your homie, instead of beefin', come hold me
I promise I'm not a phony, don't bounce, baby, console me (Come here)
Ain't nothing you can say to me that
Can change my mind, I got to let you go now (Chill, baby)
And nothing will ever be the same, so just (Yeah)
Be on your way, go ahead and do your thing now (Baby, don't go)
And there's no more to explain to me, you know (Come on, now)
I know your game and I'm not feeling what you do (Come on, now)
So I'm bouncing and I'm out, son (Don't bounce)
I gotta leave you alone, yeah, yeah (Don't bounce, don't bounce, baby)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
All my pride is all I have (Don't bounce, baby)
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad (Don't bounce, baby)
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad (Uh)
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh
All my pride is all I have (Don't bounce, baby)
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have (Baby, don't go)
You'll be needing me, but too bad (You're everything to me)
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad (You mean everything to me, baby)
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own (We all make mistakes, you know what I'm sayin'?)
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah (I still love you, baby)
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh (I'll always love you, baby)

[Outro: LL Cool J]
I promise you
You know what I'm sayin'?
I promise you
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 1]
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know ﻿I was lost

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
I wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

[Outro]
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know, I didn't know, I didn't know

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
We are one, one for sure
All united
You'll want some more
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) You make me
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) You make me
We are one, one for sure
All united
And need some more
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) You make me

I've been waiting for someone like you, yeah
All my life, I've been

I've been waiting for someone like you
Like you, like you, like you, like you, yeah

[Verse 1]
Hey, brother
There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey, sister
If you ever think my blood is thicker

[Refrain]
Oh, wear the liar's heart on my sleeve
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Chorus]
Oh, what if I'm far from home
Oh brother, I will hear you call
What if I lose all?
Oh brother, I will help you out
Wear the liar's heart on my sleeve
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Verse 3]
Hey, brother
There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey, sister
If you ever think my blood is thicker

[Refrain]
Oh, wear the liar's heart on my sleeve
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Verse 1]
Follow you to dust
Leaving footprints on the clouds as we're walking home
Iron hearts all turn to rust
By tears and the daze on a diamond street
Kiss this apocalypse
Chasing shadows with ideas that don't exist, anymore
We need to find a way

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, we are, who we are, when we're all goin' under
We're the past, we're the last, and will last until we're under
Well, we are, who we are, when we're all goin' under
We're the past, we're the last, and will last until we're under

[Verse 1]
I believe, things get tough
Sometimes my knees can barely hold me up, yeah
I'm no fool, but it’s said
You gotta walk a mile to get outta my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Come within, taste it up
Take a little bit and baby don't you give up
Get your life! Give a damn!
You gotta make a move to show 'em where we can stand, yeah

[Chorus]
Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I’m the one, tell me I'm the one that you need (Come on)
Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need (Come on)

[Verse 2]
We all weep, bleed the same
If you get the picture, leave it out of the frame, yeah
In the now, take a chance
Make a mess, and don't forget that life is a dance

[Pre-Chorus]
Come within, taste it up
Take a little bit and baby don't you give up
Get your life! Give a damn!
You gotta make a move to show 'em where we can stand

[Chorus]
Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I’m the one that you need (Come on)
Lay me down in darkness (Yes)
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I’m the one, tell me I'm the one that you need, need

[Verse 1]
Hope there's someone who'll take care of me
When I die, will I go?
And hope there's someone who'll set my heart free
Rest alone when I'm tired

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a ghost on the horizon
When I go to bed
How will I fall asleep tonight?
How will I rest my head?

[Chorus]
And godsend I don't want to go
To the seal's watershed
And there's a ghost on the horizon
When I go to bed

[Verse 1]
Oh I’m scared of that middle place
Between light and nowhere
I don’t want to be the one
Left in there, left in there

[Pre-Chorus]
Then there’s a man on the horizon
Wish that I’d go to bed
And if I fall to his feet tonight
Will allow rest my head

[Chorus]
And godsend I don't want to go
To the seal's watershed
And there's a ghost on the horizon
When I go to bed

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
God is King, we the soldiers
Ultrabeam out the solar
When I get to Heaven's gates
I ain’t gotta peek over
Keepin' perfect composure
When I scream at the chauffeur
I ain't mean, I’m just focused
I ain't mean, I'm just focused
Pour the lean out slower
Got us clean out of soda
Before the flood, people judge
They did the same thing to Noah
Everybody wanted Yandhi
Then Jesus Christ did the laundry
They say the week start on Monday
But the strong start on Sunday
Won't be in bondage to any man
John 8:33
We the descendants of Abraham
Ye should be made free
John 8:36
To whom the son set free is free indeed
He saved a wretch like me

[Chorus: Sunday Service Choir]
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, He is wonderful

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
If you woke, then wake up
With Judas, kiss and make up
Even with the bitter cup
Forgave my brothers and drank up
Did everything but gave up
Stab my back, I can't front
Still we win, we prayed up
Even when we die, we raise up (Hallelujah)
Ain't no wantin', no, we need it
The powers that be done been greedy
We need ours by this evening
No white flag or no treaty
We got the product, we got the tools
We got the minds, we got the youth
We goin' wild, we on the loose
People is lying, we are the truth
Everything old shall now become new
The leaves’ll be green, bearing the fruit
Love God and our neighbor, as written in Luke
The army of God and we are the truth

[Outro: Kanye West]
Wah, woo, wah, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Wah, woo, wah, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Wah, woo, wah, woo, woo, woo, woo

[Intro]
God is
My light in darkness, oh
God, God is
He, He is my all and all (And I'll never turn back)
God is

[Verse]
Everything that hath breath praise the Lord
Worship Christ with the best of your portions
I know I won't forget all He's done
He's the strength in this race that I run
Every time I look up, I see God's faithfulness
And it shows just how much He is miraculous
I can't keep it to myself, I can't sit here and be still
Everybody, I will tell 'til the whole world is healed
King of Kings, Lord of Lords, all the things He has in store
From the rich to the poor, all are welcome through the door
You won't ever be the same when you call on Jesus' name
Listen to the words I'm sayin', Jesus saved me, now I'm sane
And I know, I know God is the force that picked me up
I know Christ is the fountain that filled my cup
I know God is alive, yeah
He has opened up my vision
Giving me a revelation
This ain't 'bout a dead religion
Jesus brought a revolution
All the captives are forgiven
Time to break down all the prisons
Every man, every woman
There is freedom from addiction
Jesus, You have my soul
Sunday Service on a roll
All my idols, let 'em go
All the demons, let 'em know
This a mission, not a show
This is my eternal soul
This my kids, this the crib
This my wife, this my life
This my God-given right
Thank You, Jesus, won the fight

[Outro]
That's what God is
That's what God is
That's what God is

[Verse: Kanye West]
Every knee shall bow
Every tongue confess
Jesus is Lord
Jesus is Lord
Every knee shall bow
Every tongue confess
Jesus is Lord
Jesus is Lord

[Refrain: Fred Hammond]
Hand 'em
Hands up high, hands on, hands on
Hands on, hands up
In your face, the reason
Hands on, yeah, hands on

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Cut out all the lights, He the light
Got pulled over, see the brights
What you doin' on the street at night?
Wonder if they're gonna read your rights
Thirteenth Amendment, three strikes
Made a left when I should've made a right
Told God last time on life
Told the devil that I'm going on a strike
Told the devil when I see him, on sight
I've been working for you my whole life
Told the devil that I'm going on a strike
I've been working for you my whole life
Nothing worse than a hypocrite
Change, he ain't really different
He ain't even try to get permission
Ask for advice and they dissed him
Said I'm finna do a gospel album
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it feel like nobody love me
They'll be the first one to judge me
Feelin' like nobody love me
Told people God was my mission
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it feel like nobody love me
Make you feel alone in the dark and you'll never see the light
Man, you're never seein' home and you never see the domes
I can feel it when I write, point of livin' in the right
If they only see the wrongs, never listen to the songs
Just to listen is a fight, but you booked me for the fight
It's so hard to get along if they only see the slight
From the love of religion
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it seem like nobody love me
I'm not tryna lead you to Visas
But if I try to lead you to Jesus
We get called halfway believers
Only halfway read Ephesians
Only if they knew what I knew, uh
I was never new 'til I knew of
True and living God, Yeshua
The true and living God
(Somebody pray for me)

[Refrain: Fred Hammond]
Hand 'em
Hands up high, hands on, hands on
Hands on, hands up
In your face, the reason
Hands on, yeah, hands on

[Verse 2: Fred Hammond & Kanye West]
I deserve all the criticism you got
If that's all the love you have, that's all you got
To sing of change, you think I'm joking
To praise His name, you ask what I'm smoking
Yes, I understand your reluctancy, yeah
But I have a request, you see
Don't throw me up, lay your hands on me
Please, pray for me
Hold myself on death
Hold it down, all fallen down
Somebody pray for me

[Refrain: Fred Hammond]
Hand 'em
Hands up high, hands on, hands on
Hands on, hands up
In your face, the reason
Hands on, yeah, hands on

[Verse 1]
Final, time's off
Time's up, time off
Had it been, final
Turnin' up, tie in all
Heaven all wrecked, ooh
Done had it with this reign, mhm
It was written, so I read
Three stacks on the bed
I think they woke the dead

[Chorus]
Think they woke the dead, mhm
They can't keep me on the meds, doctor won't
But they, won't slow down my breath, uh
It's so many less, I think they woke the dead

[Segue]
I think they woke the dead

[Chorus]
Think they woke the dead, doctor won't
They can't keep me on the meds, doctor won't
But they, won't slow down my breath, uh
It's so many less, I think they woke the dead

[Verse 2]
Just like David said
Grindin' for the bread
Designin' for the blessed, uh
There's so many less, I think they woke the dead
Doctor won't, ah, ooh-yeah, doctor won't (Ooh-yeah)
Doctor won't, three stacks on the bed, doctor won't
I think they woke the dead

[Chorus]
Think they woke the dead, mhm
They can't keep me on the meds, doctor won't
But they, won't slow down my breath, uh
It's so many less, I think they woke the dead

[Outro]
Final, time's off
Time's up, time off
Had it been, final
There's so many less, I think they woke the dead
Time stopped, my loss
All they wish, my loss
Every stop, that's your loss
It's so many less, I think they woke the dead
Final, time's off
Time's up, time off
Had it been, final
It's so many less, I think they woke the dead

[Verse 1: MoMo Boyd]
I was on top of the mountain
I was on top of the world
I thought I'd never come down
I thought I'd always be up in the clouds
With the wind in my hair
And no worries or cares
But the higher you are
Then the harder you fall
And I fell to the ground
And I reached out for help
And nobody's around
And I'm

[Chorus: MoMo Boyd]
Falling
Falling, I'm
Falling
Falling, I'm
Falling
Falling, I'm

[Verse 2: MoMo Boyd]
I found myself in a valley
Beggin' for someone to save me
Cryin' for help every night
Hoping that someone would come to my rescue
And see that I'm hurting
But here in the valley
You're all on your own
And you've got to confess
To face with your soul
Or your personal demons
That'll eat you whole
So I look to the sky
When I thought I was dyin'
And it must have been God's
Grace on my side
Cause I saw through the shadows
The glory, his light
And I knew that if I could
Just get through the night
I'd be

[Chorus: MoMo Boyd]
Flyin'
Flyin', I'm
Flyin'
Flyin', I'm
Flyin'
Flyin', I'm

[Verse 3: MoMo Boyd]
But I found my strength in the valley
Yeah, I found my grace in the valley
Yeah, I found my faith in the valley
So thank God for the valley
Cause I found my grace in the valley
Yeah, I found my strength in the valley, in the valley
Yeah, I found my grace in the valley

[Chorus]
Closed on Sunday, you're my Chick-fil-A
Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A
Hold the selfies, put the 'Gram away
Get your family, y'all hold hands and pray
When you got daughters, always keep 'em safe
Watch out for vipers, don't let them indoctrinate
Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A
You're my number one, with the lemonade
Raise our sons, train them in the faith
Through temptations, make sure they're wide awake
Follow Jesus, listen and obey
No more livin' for the culture, we nobody's slave

[Verse]
Stand up for my home
Even if I take this walk alone
I bow down to the King upon the throne
My life is His, I'm no longer my own
I pray to God that He'll strengthen my hand
They will think twice steppin' onto my land
I draw the line, it's written in the sand
Try me and you will see that I ain't playin'
Now, back up off my family, move your hands
I got my weapons in the spirit's land
I, Jezebel don't even stand a chance
Jezebel don't even stand a chance

[Outro: A$AP Bari]
Chick-fil-A
Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: Cosmopolitan Church of Prayer Choir]
Music in my ear (In my ear)
And in the midnight hours, yes, yes
It's Sweet Jesus (It's Sweet Jesus) telling me (Telling me)
He'll keep by my side
In the midnight hours, yes, yes

[Verse 1]
Well, I'll be doggone if I wouldn't work all day (Baby)
And I'll be doggone if I wouldn't bring you my pay (Baby)
But if I ever caught you running around
Blowing my money all over this town

[Chorus]
Then I wouldn't be doggone
(Wouldn't be, wouldn't be doggone)
I'd be long gone
(I'd be long gone)
Oh baby, I wouldn't be doggone
(Wouldn't be, wouldn't be doggone)
I'd be long gone
(I'd be long gone)

[Verse 2]
Well, yeah, yeah
I'll be doggone if you ain't a pretty thing (Baby)
And I'll be doggone if you ain't warm as a breath of spring (Baby)
Oh, if we live to be a hundred years old
If you ever let that spring turn cold

[Chorus]
Then I wouldn't be doggone
(Wouldn't be, wouldn't be doggone)
I'd be long gone, oh baby
(I'd be long gone)
Well, I wouldn't be doggone
(Wouldn't be, wouldn't be doggone)
I'd be long gone
(I'd be long gone)
Yes I would, baby, hey hey

[Bridge]
What'd I say, baby?
Ah yeah, woo, look
Every woman should try to be
Whatever has man wants her to be
And I don't want much
All I want from you is for you to be true to me
Every woman should try to be
Whatever has man wants her to be
Lord, I don't want much
All I want from you is for you to be true to me

[Verse 3]
I'll be doggone if love ain't a man's best friend (Baby)
And I'll be doggone if you ain't the loving end, ah (Baby)
Oh, if I live to be a hundred years old
If you ever let that spring turn cold

[Chorus]
I wouldn't be doggone
(Wouldn't be, wouldn't be doggone)
I'd be long gone, somewhere down the road
(I'd be long gone)
I wouldn't be doggone, baby
(Wouldn't be, wouldn't be doggone)
I'd be long gone, like my daddy, baby
(I'd be long gone)
Oh, I'd be long gone
(Wouldn't be, wouldn't be doggone)
I'd be leaving, baby
(I'd be long gone)
Oh, oh
(Wouldn't be, wouldn't be doggone)
Oh, ooh, Lordy, baby
(I'd be long gone)
I'd be doggone
(Wouldn't be, wouldn't be doggone)
I'd be long gone
(I'd be long gone)
I wouldn't be doggone, baby
(Wouldn't be, wouldn't be doggone)
I'd be long gone, OW
(I'd be long gone)

[Verse 1]
Here you come again
Just when I'd begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger

[Verse 2]
Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes
And lie those pretty lies
And pretty soon I'm wondering' how I came to doubt you

[Chorus]
All you got to do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messing' up my mind and filling' up my senses

[Verse 3]
Here you come again
Looking' better than a body has a right to
And shaking' me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again
And here I go

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
All you got to do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messing' up my mind and filling' up my senses

[Verse 4]
Here you come again
Looking' better than a body has a right to
And shaking' me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again
And here I go
Here I go
And here I go
And here I go
Here you come again
And here I go
Here I go
And here I go
Here I go

[Verse 1]
Tell me, was I in your dreams?
I reached out as I was falling asleep
Thought that you were next to me
And opened up my eyes

[Verse 2]
Baby, you gotta let me know
What's the rhyme and reason for this most recent blow
I can’t take much more of this
My heart will flutter back into its cage

[Chorus]
You left me on the line
Last night
Happens all the time
To me
Thinking that I might
Pack it up and throw it all away
You left me on the line
Last night
Happens all the time
To me
Thinking that I might
Pack it up and throw it all away

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
There child, you gotta take it slow
If you move with haste you'll make a waste of it, so
(Grab yourself) Grab yourself another drink
And try to see the bottom of your cup

[Chorus]
You left me on the line
Last night
Happens all the time
To me
Thinking that I might
Pack it up and throw it all away (Throw it all away)
You left me on the line
Last night
Happens all the time
To me
I'm thinking that I might
Pack it up and throw it all away

[Outro]
I’ve seen reflections of my mortal self projected on the wall

[Verse 1]
I'm such a bore, I'm such a bummer
There must be more behind the summer
I want someone to make some trouble
Been way too safe inside my bubble, oh
Take me out and keep me up all night
Let me live on the wilder side of the light

[Chorus]
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away

[Verse 2]
You carnivore, you loose cannon
Can I have some more? I can't understand it
You fast car, you foolish spender
You know you are, and I surrender
So come on over and wake me up
Put some of your tequila in my coffee cup
You know I need you, and that's for sure
You're just the kinda crazy I've been lookin' for

[Chorus]
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
(Where the sun hits my face all different)
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away

[Intro: Drake]
D. Hill (D. Hill)
Ayy

[Chorus: Drake]
I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires

[Verse 1: Future]
You got that fire and I'm not a liar
You had me down on my knees every day, had to talk with Messiah
I'm in that 8 and that 1 and that 2, this a different Ferrari, yeah
I tried to pay all your loans off and cop you a driver, yeah
I had you stayin' too close to the city, you actin' too vulnerable livin' this life
I should've moved you away from Houston before I copped you all this ice
You wanna be my number one, you're not actin' like the main thing
I let you play my number two, you barely made the second string

[Chorus: Drake]
I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you (Ayy)
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires

[Verse 2: Drake]
Ayy
Self-control has never been your thing
Don't think it'll help if there's a ring with a rock in it
Where I'm from, they serve the soda clean (Clean, clean)
You come from a city where there's lean with the rocks in it
How the fuck you keep so many secrets?
How you goin' vegan, but still beefin' with me again?
How the fuck you've seen so many beaches?
Tickets to them places don't come cheap, and
I see you back in Turks
Remember who took you there first and don't you forget it
Got you a whip, but then you got back on your shit
I had to tell Eric go get it
I'm always movin' too fast, the feeling don't last
I feel like you take me for granted
Probably my fault for the way that I handle it

[Chorus: Drake]
I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you (Ayy)
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires

[Verse 3: Drake]
Ooh, shawty, you tried it
Voice gettin' filled with entitlement
Why would you tell me those lies? And
Why would you make it so bold to my face?
Why are your stories all over the place?
Whole lotta secrets friends don't keep safe
Where did your friends all go? (Woo)
I can't solve your problems
You say your problems never needed solvin'
I was too good to you, should've stayed solid
Nice guys always finish off where they started
Déjà vu, you wanted things and you got 'em
Déjà vu, I wanted smoke and I got it
Déjà vu, déjà
Déjà

[Outro: Mark Robinson & Drake]
Alright, so unfortunately, I'm still here (Hahaha)
But, you know, if you're here, it's still up
In the building
And you just wanna hear some chune, some music
I think, you know, you found the right spot
I'm outside in an AMG
Right outside, TT
You know, shout out my brother Drake, for you know (Too turnt, baby girl, you know me)
Popping this off real quick

[Verse 1]
I'm going to sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
I'm going to write words oh so sweet
They're going to knock me off my feet
A lotta kisses on the bottom
I'll be glad I got them

[Chorus]
I'm going to smile and say
I hope you're feeling better
I'll close with love the way you do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you

[Chorus]
I'm going to smile and say
I hope you're feeling better
And close with love the way you do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe Oh I'm gonna make believe
I'm going to make believe it came from you

[Hook]
What if it rained?
We didn't care
She said that someday soon
The sun was gonna shine
And she was right
This love of mine
My Valentine

As days and nights
Would pass me by
I tell myself that I was waiting for a sign
Then she appeared
A love so fine
My Valentine

And I will love her for life
And I will never let a day go by
Without remembering the reasons why
She makes me certain
That I can fly
And so I do
Without a care
I know that someday soon the sun is gonna shine
And she'll be there
This love of mine
My Valentine

[Hook]
What if it rained?
We didn't care
She said that someday soon
The sun was gonna shine
And she was right
This love of mine
My Valentine

[Verse]
Everything went wrong
And the whole day long
I'd feel so blue
For the longest while
I forget to smile
Then I met you
Now that my blue days have passed
Now that I’ve found you at last
I'll be loving you, always
With a love that's true, always
When the things you’ve planned
Need a helping hand
I will understand
Always, always

[Chorus]
Days may not be fair, always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
Not for just a year
But always
Days may not be fair, always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
Not for just a year
But always

[Verse 1]
I was reading Slim Aarons and I got to thinking that I thought
Maybe I'd get less stressed if I was tested less like
All of these debutantes
Smiling for miles in pink dresses and high heels on white yachts
But I'm not, baby, I'm not
No, I'm not, that, I'm not

[Chorus]
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on my walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad
Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not
But at best, I can say I'm not sad
'Cause hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have

[Verse 2]
I had 15-year dances
Church basement romances, yeah, I've cried
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums
Is the only love I've ever known
Except for the stage, which I also call home, when I'm not
Servin' up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
Hello, it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad
Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, "Hi, Dad"

[Chorus]
I've been tearing up town in my fucking white gown
Like a goddamn near sociopath
Shaking my ass is the only thing that's
Got this black narcissist off my back
She couldn't care less, and I never cared more
So there's no more to say about that
Except hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past

[Bridge]
There's a new revolution, a loud evolution that I saw
Born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly I've known
A modern day woman with a weak constitution, 'cause I've got
Monsters still under my bed that I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off

[Chorus]
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on your walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad
They write that I'm happy, they know that I'm not
But at best, you can see I'm not sad
But hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have

[Outro]
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
But I have it
Yeah, I have it
Yeah, I have it
I have

[Spoken: Jack Antonoff]
'Cause I had you in- in my head. Are you real? Are you real? Yeah? Is there any chance that I'm just gonna wake up on the floor and this song won't exist? I'll be very sad. If I wake up and you don't exist and this song doesn't exist... Yeah, I hope you're real

[Verse]
Blackbird, Blackbird, singing blues all day
Right outside my door
Blackbird, Blackbird, I gotta be on my way
To where the sun shines once more
I pack up all my cares and woes
Here I go, singing low
Bye, bye, blackbird
Where somebody waits for me
Sugar is sweet, and so is she
Bye, bye, blackbird
No one here can love and understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light
I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, bye, bye

[Outro]
No one here can love and understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
So, make my bed and light the light
I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird
Oh Blackbird
Blackbird, bye, bye
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms
You should not treat me like a stranger
Our Father would not like the way that you act
And you must realize the danger

Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you
And one deserving of affection?
And is our purpose not the same on this earth
To love and follow His direction?

We grew up together
From the cradle to the grave
We died and were reborn
And then mysteriously saved

Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door
Don’t turn away, you’ll create sorrow
Time is an ocean but it ends at the shore
You may not see me tomorrow

[Verse 1]
Once again, it's the sinister cynical minister Shady
Kryptonite to Superman, he's a dentist to Amy
Administerer of the pain, he just finished huffin' the paint
And muffler fumes like it was nothin', because it ain't
Anything in his way, his enemies he just slays
His venom he sprays, reaches like beams of energy rays
Menacing stares, he glares, making the hairs
All on the back of ya neck stand like Dracula, yep
Spectacular rep, he's a tarantula, gargantuan
Yeah, Angela, so I command ya to start dancin'
Part Manson, part Hannibal, part mechanical shark
Throwing animal parts at Scarlett Johansson
Enter my gas chamber, you gangsta? My ass
He's got his fangs to your neck, he's set to strangle ya ass, hater
You're facin' a task greater, he's chasin' your ass
He's got his face in a mask, your blood stains on his glass table
I am checking the exposure of photos of me exposing
Myself locked inside of a cozy hotel posing
With or without clothing, next to the decomposing
Bodies eroding while I'm dozing off, overdosing
Windows opening, shutting; doors opening, closing
I think there's a ghost, too much hydrocodone and codeine
I was only 'sposed to swallow a half, I took the whole thing
I'm not joking, I think I just snorted my nose ring
I need a drink, I'm standing over the sink hosing
Myself, self-loathing, cause I'm on a brink, mostly
I don't wanna think; this will make everything rosy
Beverly sings, scream while I'm severing three toesies
Totally frozen while I close in
I'm yodelling "Ro-o-w-sie, won't you come out to pla-?"
And no sense wasting time, cutting and pasting headlines
In the papers, making shrines of my crimes and capers
My words are whirlwinds, I murder my girlfriends
Go to Europe and put Nurofens in my syrup and stirred 'em
You never heard 'em like this, so don't encourage him
The neurosurgeon, coke mirrors, and lyrics worse than
The kinda person to get Katie Couric to cursin'
Eighty spirits of ladies cause Shady murdered the virgins
Crazy turn of events that he emerged
Took over the world and reeled in all the children
Lured 'em into the building and killed 'em
Buried 'em in the mulch and mildew and he will do what he feels
And still can spin, straw to gold like Rumplestilskin
Cotton to silk, Motrin to Tylenol 3 pills
The Real Slim Shady's entered the buildin'
There's nothing but crumbled leaves and tumbleweeds up in 'is husk
Mildred, he's ill with it, he still shouldn't be healed
There's no one as sick as he, MC's will get fricassed on the grill, then..
(Alchemist: Outro)
Mic-Mic-Mic-Microphone...

[Chorus]
Are you a bad girl?
Do you look super cute?
Do you ride around your city with your whole crew?
Do you like fast cars?
Do you race Subarus?
Are you a bad girl
Just like Lucy Liu?

[Post-Chorus]
Just like Lucy Liu, just like Lucy Liu
Are you a bad girl
Just like Lucy Liu?
Just like Lucy Liu, just like Lucy Liu
Are you a bad girl
Just like Lucy Liu?

[Verse]
Do you taste Tutti-Frutti?
Is your lipgloss poppin'?
When you walk into the club, is everybody watchin’?
You make your own money
Are you independent?
Do you call up all your friends when you wanna spend it?
Do you like dance-offs?
Do you like sipping bubbles?
Do you like staying out 'til 5, getting into trouble?
What’s your Instagram?
'Bout to follow you
What you doin' after this, can I come too?

[Chorus]
Are you a bad girl?
Do you look super cute?
Do you ride around your city with your whole crew?
Do you like fast cars?
Do you race Subarus?
Are you a bad girl
Just like Lucy Liu?

[Post-Chorus]
Just like Lucy Liu, just like Lucy Liu
Are you a bad girl
Just like Lucy Liu?
Just like Lucy Liu, just like Lucy Liu
Are you a bad girl
Just like Lucy Liu?

[Verse 1]
I used to go out to parties
And stand around, ooh baby
I was too nervous, baby
To really get down
But my body yearned to be free
I got up on the floor, boy
So somebody could choose me
No more standin' there beside the walls
I done got myself together, baby
And now I'm havin' a ball, woo
As long as you're groovin' there's always a chance
Somebody watchin' might wanna make romance

[Bridge]
Move it up, ooh, turn it 'round
Ooh ooh, shake it down, ooh baby
OW, ooh, ooh
Just let me in

Baby, just party all night long
Let me step into your erotic zone, woo
Ooh, baby, move it up, turn it 'round, ooh
Ooh ooh, shake it down, baby, ah baby
OW, you can bump it where you want to, baby
This is such a groovy party, baby, when you're face to face
And everybody's screamin' "This is such a groovy place"
Ooh, all the young ladies are so fine
Movin' your body leaves me with no doubt
I know what you thinkin', baby
You wanna turn me out
I'll let you do it, baby
Keep on dancin', ah baby, got to give it up
Keep on dancin', ooh baby, got to give it up
Keep on dancin', baby, ooh, oh, got to give it up
Keep on dancin', yeah, I got to give it up
Going for your own, baby? Keep on dancing, got to give it up
Keep on dancin', woo, baby, got to give it up
In the morning, baby, I, oh Lord, got to give it up

You were looking on the Soul Train
So good, I came back next week

And the way she moves, I wish she was mine"
She was moving so sexy
Deep in my heart, I knew the little girl needed me

Thank you, Mister James

[Spoken Intro]
We'd like to continue
Hope you're enjoying yourselves during the break
We thought not too long ago that we'd do something in retrospect
We had such a glorious time singing duets in our lifetime
We've had the pleasure of singing with a lot of lovely ladies
Kim Weston, Mary Wells, Miss Diana Ross
It's been a lot of fun, thank you
But, um, there's someone I love very deeply
And, um, we thought we'd get together and do a medley in her honor
We call this medley the Tammi Terrell Medley, ladies and gentlemen, because
Thank you, because these were some of her favorites

Ah, oh (Baby, yeah)

If This World Was Mine

[Verse]
If this world were mine, I'd place at your feet
All that I own; you've been so good to me
If this world were mine
I'd give you the flowers, the birds and the bees
Ooh, with your love beside me, that would be all I need
If this world were mine
I'd give you anything

[Outro]
Ooh-hoo-woo, oh
Yes I would, oh yeah
Give you flowers, baby
Give you anything, work for you, darlin'
Oh, all my money, all the lovin', baby
Sugar, yes I would
Oh, 'cause I love you
Oh, ooh-hoo

Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing

[Chorus]
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing, no no no
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

[Verse]
I've got your picture hangin' on the wall
It can't see or come to me when I call your name
I realize it's just a picture in a frame
I read your letters but you're not near
Oh, they don't move me
They don't groove me like when I hear
Honey, your sweet voice whispering in my ear

[Chorus]
Ah baby, ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Oh, nothing like the real thing, baby
There's nothing like the real, oh, real thing, real thing, baby

[Outro]
Woo, yeah
We wasn't always down, you know
Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson wrote some very very up songs
Been recorded a lot, too, I'm sure you might recognize it
You wanna sing along, help yourself

Ain't No Mountain High Enough

[Chorus]
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you
Oh, ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you

[Verse]
Remember the day I set you free
I told you you could always count on me, darling
From that day on, I made a vow
I'll be there when you want me
Some way, some how
Oh, baby there

[Chorus]
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, baby
To keep me from getting to you, baby
Oh, to keep me from getting to you
From getting to you, ooh

[Spoken Intro]
Thank you
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen

Well, it really don't matter...OW!

[Chorus]
How sweet it is to be loved by you, hey hey, woo
How sweet it is to be loved by you, yes it is, baby

[Verse 1]
I needed the shelter of someone's arms
And there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs
And there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to stop (Stop) and thank you baby
I just want to stop (Stop) and thank you baby

[Chorus]
How sweet it is to be loved by you, yes it is, baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you, hey, ow

[Verse 2]
I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore
All the things I did it seems I'd done it before
But you brightened up all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop (Stop) and thank you baby
I want to stop (Stop) and thank you baby, hoo

[Chorus]
How sweet it is to be loved by you, hey, hey hey, ow

[Chorus]
How sweet it is to be loved by you, oh, right now, right now, baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you, oh, hey, woo

Thank you, thank so much, ladies and gentlemen

[Spoken Intro]
Thank you
Thank you so much, ladies and gentlemen
Thank you so much, that's so nice

Woo, we're gonna go back for the sake of going old too
Wanting a few oldies but goodies, I hope they're goodies
(Ain't that peculiar, ain't that peculiar)

[Verse 1]
Honey, you do me wrong but still i'm crazy about you
Hey, stay away too long and I can't do without you
Woo, every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
Ah ah, each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers grow through rain
But how can love grow from pain?
(Pain, pain, pain, pain)

[Chorus]
Ain't that peculiar (Ain't that peculiar)
A peculiar-ality (Ain't that peculiar)
Ain't that peculiar, baby (Ain't that peculiar)
Peculiar as can be (Ain't that peculiar)
Oh

[Verse 2]
You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
But I'm so much in love with you, baby, I don't want to see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you
Makes all your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger?
(Stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)

[Chorus]
Ain't that peculiar (Ain't that peculiar)
A peculiar-ality (Ain't that peculiar)
Ain't that peculiar, baby (Ain't that peculiar)
Peculiar as can be (Ain't that peculiar)
Oh

[Bridge]
Hey baby, I feel alright
Ain't it peculiar, baby
Peculiar day and night
Oh, hey baby, hey now, ain't it peculiar
Come on, sugar, ah ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, I'm ready, hey...

Ooh, I bet you're wonderin' how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I love you more

[Pre-Chorus]
It took me by surprise I must say
When I found out yesterday

[Chorus]
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine, baby, ooh

[Verse 2]
Now, I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life, you see
'Cause you mean that much to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, you could have told me yourself
That you loved someone else

[Chorus]
Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine, baby
Now I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine, baby, ooh
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine, baby
Oh, Lord have mercy
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine, baby, yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Bridge]
When I heard the news
I didn't know what to do, baby
Ah, it started to tear me up, broken up in my heart, baby
I didn't know how to handle the feeling, baby
I don't wanna believe it, baby, no I don't
Broke down and began to go on, baby
I broke down on being alone
Why, baby? Oh baby, oh why
Don't you love me no more, baby?
Don't you love me, baby?
Oh baby, ah baby
Ooh, I can't stand it
I, now listen here

[Verse 3]
Now, I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life, you see
'Cause you mean that much to me, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Should have told me yourself
That you loved someone else, baby

[Chorus]
But instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
I heard it through the grapevine, baby
Girl, I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine, baby, ooh
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine, baby, yes I did
I heard it through the grapevine, hey

[Outro]
Heard it through the grapevine, y'all

[Intro]
I'm ready to make it
Don't care what the weather
Don't care 'bout no trouble
Got myself together
I feel the kind of protection
That's all around me

Woo, woo, feel alright, baby
Do it one more time

[Verse 1]
Ooh, I come up hard, baby
But now I'm cool
I didn't make it, baby
Playin' by the rules
I come up hard
But now I'm fine
I'm checkin' trouble, baby
Movin' down the line

[Verse 2]
I come up hard, baby
Oh, I'm in for real with the trouble minds
Keep movin' on the town
Come up hard, I'm gettin' down
There's only three things that's for sho', ow
Taxes, death and trouble
This I know, hey hey
And that's for sho'
(This I know, this I know)
Ain't gonna let it sweat me, baby
Not the trouble man
Hey, ow, trouble man, woo

[Bridge]

Play it again, the introduction

Oh, when you lose the one you love
It's a cold hard feeling, baby
Lord have mercy
Well, I said a man ain't supposed to cry
But I lost my baby
And the tears start streaming from my eyes
Used to come home from work, go to my lonely room and say
"Baby, why did you leave me?"
Then sometimes I get overcome with emotion
And fall in pieces, "Why?" OW

[Verse 1]
Distant lover, lover (Lover, lover, lover)
Oh baby, so many miles away
Woo, Heaven knows that,that I long for you, baby
Every night (Every night)
Oh, sometimes I yearn through the day
Distant lover, woo (Lover, lover, lover)
You should think about me, Lord have mercy
Somebody say a prayer for me
Please, ah please, think about me sometimes, oh
Think about me here, here in misery, misery
Save me, baby

[Bridge]
As I reminisce, baby
Through our joyful summer together
All the promises we made
All the daily letters
Then all of a sudden
Everything seemed to explode
Now, I gaze out my window
Darling, down a lonely road, ooh

[Verse 2]
Distant lover (Lover, lover, lover)
How can you treat my heart so mean and cruel all the time?
Every single moment, Lord have mercy, that I spent with you
I treasure it like it was a precious jewel
Save me, baby, Lord, help me, Lord

[Outro]
Oh, how could you leave me? Please don't go, oh
I said, ah baby, please come back, baby

Somethin' I wanna say
When you left you took all of me with you
Now I pray, Father
Does she wanna hear me plead, and scream, and get on my knees?
I don't know, please, oh please, come back
Oh, oh, oh baby, please, oh, ooh, come back home
Oh, yeah
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Rockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have-nots
Money, we make it
'Fore we see it, you take it

[Chorus]
Oh, makes me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Oh, makes me wanna holler
The way they do my life
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'

Oh, makes me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands
Makes me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands, oh

[Bridge]
Sing about the inner city blues, yes, baby
Ah baby, singing about the inner city blues
I'm singing about the babies that ain't got no mama
Down in the ghetto, all over the world
Singing about the children, the hungry people
The old people, baby, all over the world
Inner city blues, yes it is, baby
Yes it is, baby
Ah, got no job, baby
Singing about the inner city blues
I'm singing about the lies in my head, baby
I think it's gonna be a little worse, what it is today
I'm singing about the blues, inner city blues, baby
One more thing, one more thing
What you say? Listen
Radiation, ah baby, is 'bout to fall
And your life in the hands of madness, yes it is
Woo, don't be misled by all the lies they tell
Those in control, you know, they lie to you, baby
Please, I got the blues the most, more than anybody
I got the blues, I got the blues the most
Turn off the nuclear issues, turn off the nuclear issues, baby
Turn it off
Coast to coast, all over the world, country
Started, it's already started, baby, yeah baby

Lord have mercy, I got the blues
Help me, baby, ow

[Instrumental break]

Inner city blues
Ah baby, inner city blues

[Intro]
Here we have something for you folks, we hope
You enjoy it as we enter our social section
Thank you

[Verse]
Whoa, ah, mercy mercy me
Ah, things ain't what they used to be, no no
Where did all the blue skies go?
Poison is the wind that blows from the north and south and east
Whoa, mercy, mercy me, hey
Ah, things ain't what they used to be
Oil wasted on the ocean and upon our seas, fish full of mercury
Ah Jesus, yeah, mercy, mercy me
Ah, ah, things ain't what they used to be, oh
Radiation underground and in the sky
Animals and birds who live nearby are dying
Hey, mercy, mercy me, oh
Hey, things ain't what they used to be
What about this overcrowded land?
How much more abuse from man can she stand?
Oh, na na na, oh oh oh oh oh, hey, ooh, woo

[Intro]
What's happenin', brother? What's going on, man?
This is our very first number one record ever in the world, baby
We were so proud
Thanks to you, you made it so
Hope you still enjoy it

[Verse 1]
Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
(Got to find, got to find a way)
To bring some lovin' here today, oh

Father, father
We don't need to escalate
War is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
(Got to find, got to find a way)
Bring some understandin' here today, oh baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Picket lines (Sister), picket signs (Sister)
Don't punish me (Sister) with brutality (Sister, sister, sister)
Talk to me (Sister), so you can see (Sister)

[Chorus]
What's going on (What's going on)
What's going on (What's going on)
What's going on (What's going on)
What's going on (What's going on)
Ooh, ah baby, woo

[Verse 2]
Mother, mother
Everybody thinks we're wrong, hey hey
Who are they to judge us
Simply because our hair is long
Oh, you know we've got to find a way
(Got to find, got to find a way)
Bring some understanding here today

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, picket lines (Brother), picket signs (Brother)
Don't punish me (Brother) with brutality (Brother, brother, brother)
Talk to me (Brother)
So you can see (Brother)

[Chorus]
What's going on (What's going on)
What's going on (What's going on)
What's going on (What's going on)
What's going on (What's going on)
Woo, hoo hoo hoo

[Bridge]
Baby, what's going on
Baby baby, what's going on, hoo
What's going on, baby?
I want to know now now now now, right now, baby
Tell me what's going on, hoo, ah baby
Oh baby

[Outro]
Ladies and gentlemen, can we give our orchestra a fine round of applause?
They're marvelous
Thank you ladies, gentlemen
I've often asked myself, what's really going on, baby?
This was my revelation
I asked so many
What's going on for me is my purpose, ladies and gentlemen
Little thing called purpose
Purpose of livin' - you say "Why? What's it for?"
Ha, yeah, me too
I know my purpose, my purpose is to become a better artist
A better writer, whatever you want to call it
To serve, to feed you from heart and soul
Being true to myself, the energies that I feel and sense inside
That's my purpose
Hear about my purpose - then I wanted to know - that ain't enough
What's everybody's real purpose? What's going on?
What's going on with life?
And after reading all the books, talking to wise men
Talking with my father, everybody, I felt what's wise and good
Came down to the same word
Said everybody's purpose is to glorify God's creation
Who is God? What is God? Is He a He, She, a It, what? I don't know
All I know is, what I dream, what I see, the mountains
Who made all those sands, the beach? Makes the winds to blow?
A beautiful little baby, the magic of creation, your power
He said we're made in his image
We, we, our purpose, glorify His creation, baby
Why should we do that?
To join the, join the spirit, to become one with that, which is
This is our learning ground
It makes us worthy - how else are we worthy?
Except we prove that we're worthy
And then one day we know we're a spirit anyway, we become a spirit
When we're worthy, we can rejoin the flame
The flame is pure, it's all - we must get rid of the evil
And then we can rejoice - that's what's going on, baby, I guess, as I see it
Well, we must say, ladies and gentlemen, it's been fun
Singing for you this evening
We sincerely hope that you've gotten some good energy from us
We do love you, we really do love you
We love our work
'Til we meet again, be good to each other
Goodbye, God bless you all, I love you
Thank you!

Right on baby
Right on baby

[Intro]
Ah, that's the groove right there, baby
That's the groove, yeah
We gon' get it on, baby, yeah
Ah baby, you know I love you
And I missed you, baby, when you left
Oh yeah, baby
And I yearned all week, baby, for you to come home, yes I did
And now when I saw you walking down the sidewalk, baby (Come get to this)
I said, "Baby, come get to this" (Come get to this)
Come get it, baby (Come get to this)
Come and get all the touch, come hug me, baby (Come get to this)
Come and kiss me, baby, give me some love (Come get to this)
Oh, darlin', come and get to this (Come get to this)

[Outro]
Oh, baby, come here, let me caress you
Oh, honey, your letters told me what you missed
Come here, baby, get to this (Baby)
Ah baby, I want you here
I want to do something freaky to you
I want to feel all the love I felt when you left me, darling
Oh, come here, baby, get to this (Baby)
(Background sounds of people partying throughout)

I used to go out to parties and stand around
'Cause I was too nervous to really get down
But my body yearned to be free
I got out on the floor and thought somebody could choose me

No more standing there beside the walls
Now I got myself together, baby, and I'm having a ball
As long as you're grooving, there's always a chance
Somebody watching might wanna make romance

Move your body
Oooh, baby, you dance all night
To the groove and feel alright
Everybody's grooving on like a fool
Oooh!  Oooh!

[Announcer]
It's showtime, ladies and gentlemen
Ladies and gentlemen, London Palladium proudly presents
The star of the show, let's get it on for soul
Mister Marvin Gaye

[Intro]
Woo, ooh-wee, ooh, ooh
Alright, ooh, oh

[Verse 1]
If you wanna do it, let's it get it on
But how you gonna act this time around
Before I take it off down to the skin
Let's get an understanding
Girl, you didn't understand my philosophy
You did not understand
You just ran away from me
Oh, I missed you, baby
Ooh, I missed you, I miss you
You're the best I ever had

[Verse 2]
Ah, you're so bad, baby
But I must like you like that
Although you won't let me control this or that
I still find you're where it's at
But now I see you're coming straight to the point
You said the more you get, baby
Ah, the more you want
Yeah, darling, darling, you're not wasting my time
What I see, baby, is so hard to find

[Verse 3]
Although you've been all, all over town, baby
Having your affairs, I still got to accept you back
Angel, although you're promiscuious
I don't mind a bit 'cause you're still the greatest lay
Even when you're miles away, woo

[Bridge]
Ah, grl, if you run away again
Surely my heart would never mend
Don't tell me the love we made
Was just for old times sake
Staying up waiting for you to come home at night
Was just so hard to take
She said that pain might never mend
So let's be sometime lovers
And, oh baby, that's when my poor heart broke up

[Outro]
Well, if you got a girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life
Ooh, if you got a baby girl and you want her for your wife
You better love her good and love her all her life
If you got a little girl you want her for your wife
Love her good and love her all your life, woo
If you got a girl and you want her for your wife
You better love her good and love her all her life, baby
Do it one more time
If you got a girl and you want her for your wife
Love her good, love her all her life
Be good to her, love her good, woo
Thank you
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen
Thank you so much

[Intro]
Thank you
Ah yeah, wonderful

Hello
Nice to see you, good evening
We're going to try and make you happy this evening
We're gonna do our very best, our very best, baby
We're gonna sing some of the old things, the new ones
Try to answer all the requests
I like that groove
Yeah, here's one from my very latest

[Verse 1]
This is the story of two lovers who shouldn't have been
They did their thing and went their separate ways again
Then by chance, they happen to meet at the neighborhood dance
Got that old feeling all over again
He said, "How much I've missed me since I had you?"
How much, ooh baby, how much?
Oh, I really wondered, ah baby
Wondered if you remember, baby
How good you made it to me, darling
Such a thrill
But it's been so hard since I had you, baby
Ah baby, come on, give me a break
'Cause it's been so hard since I had you, baby

[Verse 2]
My, oh, my eyes must look serious
'Cause when I look at you I get delirious, baby
Your voice sounds so serious
But since we're still friends
Let me make love to you again, baby

[Chorus]
Don't make me wait
So hard since I had your sugar
Oh baby, don't make me wait
'Cause it's been so hard since I had you, baby

[Bridge]
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, oh, oh baby
Whoa, baby, still you look good
Sugar, you look so fine
Still I love you, baby

You know, I gotta tell you right now
I must've been a fool to have ever let you go
And I've been thinking about you hard, hard, hard ever since you've been gone
So glad to see you, baby
Let me take you home
Let me tell you how I feel about you, really, baby, oh

[Outro]
Since I had you, girl, I haven't wanted no other lover, ooh ooh
Since I had you, honey, there hasn't been no other lover, baby
No other lover, ooh, hoo
Since I dig your lovin', darling, I haven't wanted no other love
Since you socked it to me, baby, I ain't been no good for no other woman
Oh, since you came in
Since I had, since, baby, since I had your love

[Verse 1]
I've been really tryin', baby
Tryin' to hold back this feeling for so long
And if you feel, like I feel, baby
Then come on, oh, come on, woo

[Chorus]
Let's get it on (Let's get it on), oh baby (Let's get it on)
Lets get it on (Let's get it on), let's love, baby (Let's get it on)
Let's get it on (Let's get it on), sugar (Let's get it on)
Let's get it on (Let's get it on), woo-hoo (Baby)

[Verse 2]
We're all sensitive people (Don't you understand?)
With so much to give, understand me, sugar (Don't you understand?)
Since we got to be here (Don't you understand?)
Let's live, I love you (Don't you understand?)
There's nothin' wrong with me lovin' you
Baby, no, no, no
And givin' yourself to me can never be wrong
If the love is true, oh baby, ooh-hoo

[Bridge]
I know you know what I been dreamin' of, don't you, baby?
My whole body wants that feeling of love, I'm happy, woo
Ain't gonna worry, I ain't gonna push
I won't push you, baby, ooh
Come on, come on, come on, come on, darling
Stop beatin' 'round the bush

Oh, gonna get it on (Let's get it on), threatin' you, baby (Let's get it on)
I wanna get it on (Let's get it on)
You don't have to worry that it's wrong (Let's get it on)
If the spirit moves you, let me groove you good (Let's get it on)
Let your love come out (Let's get it on)
Oh, get it on (Let's get it on), come on baby
Do you know the meaning of being sanctified? Ow
You give me good feeling
So good, somethin' like sanctified
Do right, baby
Nothing wrong with love
If you want to love me, let yourself go
Oh baby, let's get it on
Please, let's get it on, right now, baby, ow, woo, woo

Oh, ow, haha, come on, little baby, let me turn the music way down

Turn the music down, baby, this is a good station too, baby
Oh, Lord have mercy, oh God
Come here little baby, let me get — let me grab it, baby
Baby, let me turn the lights down low, baby
Come on, baby, let me turn the lights way down low, baby

Very happy, huh?
Thank you, folks, hahaha, ah, you're a great audience
We're having a nice time
Everybody having a pretty nice time? Okay
We had your written in requests for some songs
And some of the songs are back, we'll get to all of those
And some of the songs that we did back in the '60s
And we'd like to try and sing for you now a medley of songs
To answer your requests, and we sincerely hope you — hahaha
Ladies and gentlemen, I don't do this so good, so, you know
I might just stop and go right into the song, you know, I'm really nuts
Hahaha, in fact, I think I will

[Intro]
A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four
Woo, these are songs we recorded back in 1960-something-or-other
I think it didn't go much further back

Ain't That Peculiar

[Verse]
Honey, you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you — thank you
Stay away too long and i can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers grow from rain
But how can love go from pain?

[Chorus]
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar ality
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be
You're A Wonderful One

[Intro]
Oh, baby, oh
Oh baby, ah baby
And you're a wonderful one
You're wonderful, baby

[Verse]
In you there is a rare quality
Your love, baby, it means the world to me
For me you're always concerned
And you ask nothin', baby, in return
You're really more than I deserve
From my heart I mean these words
You're a wonderful one, oh baby

[Outro]
You're so wonderful
You're so divine
You're my wonderful one, ah baby

Stubborn Kind Of Fellow

Got my mind made up to love you

Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, ah baby

And if it means giving up my life

There's always one who loves more than the other

Have your love at any sacrifice

[Chorus]
Darlin', I love you
Little darlin', I need you
Little darlin', I want you
Little darlin', got to have you, oh
Oh

I Heard It Through The Grapevine

[Verse]
I bet you're wonderin' how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I loved you more
It took me by surprise I must say
When I found out yesterday

[Chorus]
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, I'm just about to lose my mind

[Outro]
Honey, honey, ow
Yeah, baby, that's what I heard
Oh sugar, woo, woo
Wait a minute, I need a ride

Hitch Hike

[Verse 1]
I'm going to Chicago; that's the last place my baby strayed
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike, baby (Hitch hike)
I'm packin' up my bags, gonna leave this old town right away
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike, baby (Hitch hike)
I've got to find that girl if I have to hitch hike all around the world
(Hitch hike)

[Verse 2]
Chicago City Limits, that's what the sign on the highway read
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike, baby, woo (Hitch hike)
I'm gonna keep movin till I get to that street corner 6th and 3rd
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike (Hitch hike)
Gonna find that girl if I have to hitch hike all around the world
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike, baby

[Outro]
Hitch hike (Hitch hike), ah, hitch a ride (Hitch hike)
(Hitch hike, hitch hike) Hitch hike, baby, wow

You

[Verse 1]
Oh, you, you I see in my mirror in the mornin'
Instead of seein' me
I see you, I see your face
And inside me is a growing need for your embrace
In the light of day, though our faces meet
Someone there might see, so we never speak
'Til the dark of night, while the moon is new
When we whisper words of love in our secret rendezvous
Somethin's wrong I know, girl, I love you so
I love you, need you, baby, wow

Save The Children

[Intro]
I just want to ask a question
Who really cares?

[Verse]
There'll come a time, when the world won't be singin'
Flowers won't grow, oh no, baby, bells won't be ringin'
Who really cares?
Who is willing to try, yes darling
To save a world that's destined to die?
When I look at the world, oh, it fills me with sorrow
Children today, are they gonna suffer, suffer tomorrow?
Oh, what a shame, such a bad way to live
Ah, who is to blame when we can't stop livin'?

[Outro]
Oh, live for life, live for life
But let live everybody
Live life for the children
For the children
Oh baby, please, everybody save the babies
Oh please, save the babies
If you want love, you've got to love
Save the children, oh, oh
Save all the beautiful babies
Save the babies
Oh, save the children
Oh, oh, love the children

Thank you
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen

[Intro: Marvin Gaye]
You know, ladies and gentlemen
Very few performers have the privilege of singing with four marvelous ladies during the course of a career, or any other time for that matter
I consider myself very lucky privileged to perform with Mary Wells, Miss Mary Wells, Kim Weston, Miss Diana Ross, and Miss Tammi Terrell
Oh, she'd like that, she would, she'd like that, thank you
For her, I thank you too
So in order to perform these songs for you, a charming lady dancer is about to come to the stage to assist us
So won't you get together out there and welcome to the stage Miss Florence Lyles, ladies and gentlemen
Come on, Flo, baby
Thanks, baby
Yes, baby

You're All I Need To Get By

Honey, honey, honey, yeah
You're all I need to get by
Ah, little baby, woo-hoo, let me talk to you, baby
And then some say, yes baby

[Verse: Marvin & Florence]
Like the sweet morning dew, I took one look at you
And it was plain to see, you were my destiny
My arms open wide, I threw away my pride
I'll sacrifice for you, dedicate my life to you

[Pre-Chorus: Marvin & with Florence]
Oh, I will go where you lead
Always there in time of need
And when I lose my will
You'll be there to push me up the hill
There's no, no looking back for us
We got love sure 'nough, that's enough
You're all, you're all I need to get by

[Chorus: Marvin & Florence]
You're all I need to get by
Ah baby, all I need, baby, woo

Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing

[Chorus: Marvin & Florence]
Ooh, ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing, no
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

[Verse: Marvin & Florence]
Ooh
I've got your picture hangin' on the wall
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name
I realize it's just a picture in a frame
Ooh, I read your letters you're not here
But they don't move me
And they don't groove me like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear
Don't you know

[Chorus: Marvin & Florence]
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing, no no
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

[Outro: Marvin & Florence]
Ooh

Nothing in this world, baby

No one like my pretty pretty baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Oh, nothing in the world
Ain't nothing, nothing like the real thing
Your Precious Love

[Verse 1: Marvin]
Let me say this to you, baby, I haven't really expressed this
Ooh, every day there's something new
Honey, to keep me lovin' you
And with every passin' minute
Ah sugar, so much joy wrapped up in it

[Chorus: Marvin & Florence]
Oh, Heaven must have sent you from above
Whoa, Heaven must have sent your precious love

[Verse 2: Florence & Marvin]
And now (Talk to me), I've got a song to sing (Talk to me)
Tellin' the world (Oh) about the joy you bring
And you gave me, you gave me a reason for livin'
And ooh, you taught me, you taught me the reason of givin'

[Chorus: Marvin & Florence]
Oh, Heaven must have sent you from above
Whoa, Heaven must have sent your precious love, woo

It Takes Two

[Verse 1: Marvin & Florence]
One can have a dream, baby
Two can make that dream so real
One can talk about bein' in love
Two can say how it really feels
One can wish upon a star
Two can make that wish come true, yeah
One can stand alone in the dark
Two can make the light shine through

[Chorus: Marvin & Florence]
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Me and you
Just takes two
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
To make a dream come true, hey baby
Just takes two, ooh

[Intro: Marvin]
Wait a minute now
I know there's, yeah

[Verse 1: Marvin & Florence]
Listen, baby

You don't have to worry
'Cause baby there

[Chorus: Marvin & Florence]
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, babe

[Verse 2: Marvin]
Remember the day I set you free
I told you you could always count on me
From that day on, I made a vow
I'll be there when you want me
Some way, some how
'Cause baby there

[Chorus: Marvin & Florence]
Ain't no mountain high enough

To keep me from getting to you, babe...

Ain't no mountain high enough

[Bridge: Marvin & Florence]
No baby

To keep me from getting to you

And ain't no mountain high
And wanna love in the valley
No valley low
Ooh
Keep me from all your love, baby

[Chorus: Marvin & Florence]
You know there ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, babe

And this fine, fine orchestra, ladies and gentlemen
Please, take a bow, take a bow
Thank you
It's not everyone who's privileged enough to have a nice lady vibraphonist

Thank you so much, ladies and gentlemen

[Intro]
Well, it appears — yes, go ahead, Leslie, it's alright, I'm sure it is
To sing for you now a little bit of "Distant Lover"
I'm gonna sing a little bit of "Distant Lover" for you tonight
Baby, oh baby baby
Lord, when you lose the one you love, it's a cold, cold hard feeling
Whenever it come over a man
You see, a man ain't supposed to cry
When I lost my baby, hey, and I tried to be strong
Come home from work, baby, I had to face a lonely room
And the four walls began to close on me, all around me
And I began to think my baby, said, "Baby, why'd you leave me, baby?"
Well, and then, I didn't wanna cry, baby
I broke down on my knees and screamed "Oh baby, ahh"

[Verse 1]
Distant lover, lover (Lover, lover, lover)
Ooh, so many miles away
Please, Heaven knows that I long for you
Every night, every night, every night
And sometimes I yearn through the day
Distant lover, ooh, lover (Lover, lover, lover)
You should think about me
Say a prayer for me
Please, please, ah please
Think about me sometimes
Think about me here
Here in misery
Save me, baby, save me

[Bridge]
As I reminisce through our joyful summer together
The promises we made, all the daily letters
Then, all of a sudden, everything seemed to explode
Now, I gaze out my window down a lonesome road, ooh

[Verse 2]
Distant lover, oh baby (Lover, lover, lover)
Oh, oh, how can you treat my heart so mean and cruel?
Didn't you know every moment that I spent with you
I treasure it like it was a precious jewel
Ooh, save me, baby, Lord have mercy

[Outro]
You see, you know, I said
Oh, I beg you, baby, baby, baby, please, don't leave me, don't go
I said, baby, come back, baby
Somethin' I wanna say
When you left you took all of me with you
Now baby, I wonder
Would it help if I pleaded and screamed, plead?
Well, please, oh please, come back home, girl
Ah baby, oh, oh baby, please, darlin', oh girl, woo
Come back home, home, home
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm like a white Michael Vick, psycho enough to stick
Michael J. Fox in a microwave with a Rott (Ell-ell-elle)
I might make a little Alizé with a side of NyQuil
And ride a motorcycle right through the side of my high school
Satan's disciple with a sniper rifle
And a knife and a white diaper
Liable to shit on you while I snipe you
So dope he gets off opiates
What an appropriate way to start off his day
He may just smart off to Dre
He may be hard to contain
‘Cause his rage is so hard to gauge
See, Hannibal ate his face, and met Jason, gnawed off his leg
Amazin' hard-on for razors and blades
And anything sharp, even poisonous darts
It all plays a major part of his game
Holy water won't ward him off, crucifixes won't do the trick
He's so sick, it's ridiculous
Sawed the crazy part off his brain, he's still insane
Why's there bloodstains on his carpet, mane?
There's some crazy shit goin' on in Shady's apartment again (woosh)

[Verse 2]
Newsflash, I'm still trash
Them pills shoulda killed my ass
But they didn't; they just made me stronger
It's like they rebuilt my ass
Like the Six Million Dollar Man after the crash
It's Aftermath, bitch! And my milk glass is still half-empty
Yeah, tempt me, Hell isn't enough
They need to invent somewhere new to send me
As sick as I'm getting
They'll stick me in a conventional oven
With a rotisserie setting and won't even notice me sweating
Shit, I done made a verse, said some foul shit
Tryna go back fix it, fucked around, and just made it worse
Yeah, I'm back, looking no worse for wear
Got these haters mad enough to rip off their hair
And start punchin' the air
Fall the fuck out, spill your lunch in the chair (eww)

[Verse 3]
(Chicka) I'll do a hundred-yard dash just to slash Kim Kardash'
In the ass with a shard of glass from Nick Hogan's car crash
You may look like the passenger for that, don't be a smartass
Yeah, laugh while you sit there
Thinkin' that the hard part passed
You ain't seen pain 'til Leatherface flips mane
I'll cut your fuckin' balls off, homie, my saw's off the chain
I chopped the bitch in half with it, sawed off her legs
And the top half of the torso fuckin' crawled off insane
I ain't seen shit like that since I went to Mike Jack's
Took the Elephant Man's skull, fucked it, and put it right back
Handed my dick to Bubbles
While he sucked it and licked my nut sack
Gave him a reach-around
While I fucked him right in his butt crack
Nah, I ain't takin' it back fo.., fuck that!
I give a fuck about nothin', so here's where you fucked up at
Don't go touchin' that can
Man, you don't wanna open up that

[Outro]
Wait a min-ahh, shit… Alchemist, cut that..
(Laughter, Record Scratching)

My people say I'm trippin' 'cause I'm fallin' for you (aye)

Leave me lonely, leave me lonely
Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me

Believe in what I say

Woke up wasted on your love

Saucin' on your love

Rollin' on your love

[Chorus]
Woke up wasted on your love
Woke up wasted on your love
(Wasted)
Woke up wasted on your love
I ain't tryna sober up (wasted)
I'm hungover you because
Too much is never enough
Wasted love (Yeah yeah)
Too much is never enough
Wasted love
So wasted
Too much is never enough
Wasted...

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
You at the W, with me, that's a W
Baby, watch me change your life (Yeah)
I see you fuck me up, I just wanna utilize your body on top of mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I gotta hold your room with a minibar
I'm about to max you out like a credit card
You'll probably tape me going at it, so make that 911 call

[Chorus]
'Cause the heroes do the walls
Bodies crashing, hear them crashing, banging on the walls
Fire burning down the curtains 

[?]
We can shake the room until the ceilings fall

[?] until they hear you through the walls
Hear it through them wall

[Verse 2]
I've gotten into you like I'm your swimming pool
I've been in that pussy all day
We gettin' physical, body gotta know
But I got a feeling that body know

[Pre-Chorus]
I gotta hold your room with a minibar
I'm about to max you out like a credit card
You'll probably tape me going at it, so make that 911 call

[Chorus]
'Cause the heroes do the walls
Bodies crashing, hear them crashing, banging on the walls
Fire burning down the curtains 

[?]
We can shake the room until the ceilings fall

[?] until they hear you through the walls
Hear it through the walls

[Bridge]
Ammo ammo, baby, you can have my ammo

[?] like a rental

[?], I'mma grab my camera

[?] bringing down your walls

[Chorus]
Bodies crashing, hear them crashing, banging on the walls
Fire burning down the curtains 

[?]
We can shake the room until the ceilings fall

[?] until they hear you through the walls (Through the walls, baby)
Hear it through them walls (Walls, walls, walls)

[Verse 1]
I'm so afraid of my world
Thinkin' 'bout walking away
With or without you
Can't blame you if you wanna stay

[Chorus]
We are young
Don't wanna change things up
We are dumb
You just laugh and point your finger
We are young
Leave me the fuck alone
I can leave without ya
We are young
We are young
We are dumb
We are young
I can leave without ya
I can leave without ya
I can leave without ya

[Verse 2]
A shot from .9-millimetre
Guess my heart got in the way
I did it all to myself
Yeah, that's what you want me to think

[Chorus]
We are young
Don't wanna change things up
We are dumb
You just laugh and point your finger
We are young
Leave me the fuck alone
I can leave without ya
We are young
We are young
We are dumb
We are young
I can leave without ya
I can leave without ya
I can leave without ya

[Hook]
What if it rained?
We didn't care
She said that someday soon
The sun was gonna shine
And she was right
This love of mine
My Valentine

As days and nights
Would pass me by
I tell myself that I was waiting for a sign
Then she appeared
A love so fine
My Valentine

And I will love her for life
And I will never let a day go by
Without remembering the reasons why
She makes me certain
That I can fly
And so I do
Without a care
I know that someday soon the sun is gonna shine
And she'll be there
This love of mine
My Valentine

[Hook]
What if it rained?
We didn't care
She said that someday soon
The sun was gonna shine
And she was right
This love of mine
My Valentine

[Verse 1]
My very good friend, the milkman says
That I've been losing too much sleep
He doesn't like the hours I keep
And he suggests that you should marry me
My very good friend, the mailman says
That it would make his burden less
We both had the same address
And he suggests that you should marry me

[Chorus]
Then there's a very friendly fellow who prints
All the latest real estate news
And every day he sends me blueprints
Of cottages with country views

[Verse 2]
All my very good friends, the neighbors say
That they've been watching little things I do
And they perceive that I love you
So I suggest that you should marry me

[Chorus]
Then there's a very friendly fellow who prints
All the latest real estate news
And every day he sends me blueprints
Of cottages with country views

[Outro]
And my very good friends, the neighbors say
They've been watching little things I do
They perceive that I love you
So I suggest that you should marry me

[Intro]
Evening marks the close of day
Skies of blue begin to grey
Crimson hues are fading in the west
Evening ever brings to me
Dreams of days that used to be
Memories of those I love the best

[Chorus 1]
When shadows fall and trees whisper, day is ending
My thoughts are ever wending home
When crickets call, my heart is forever yearning
Once more to be returning home

[Chorus 2]
When the hills conceal the setting sun
Stars begin a-peeping, one by one
Night covers all, and though fortune may forsake me
Sweet dreams will ever take me home
Take me home

[Chorus 2]
When the hills conceal the setting sun
Stars begin a-peeping, one by one
Night covers all, and though fortune may forsake me
Sweet dreams will ever take me home

[Verse 1]
Say, its only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

[Verse 2]
Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

[Chorus]
Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

[Verse 3]
It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

[Chorus]
Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

[Verse 3]
Yeah, It's a Barnum and Bailey world
About a phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

[Outro]
If you believed in me
If you believed in me

[Verse 1]
Velvet, I can wish you for the collar of your coat
And fortune smiling all along your way
But more I cannot wish you than to wish you find your love
Your own true love this day

[Verse 2]
Mansions, I can wish you, seven footmen all in red
And calling cards upon a silver tray
But more I cannot wish you than to wish you find your love
Your own true love this day

[Chorus]
Standing there gazing at you
Full of the bloom of youth
Standing there gazing at you
With the sheepish eye and the look of the truth

[Verse 2]
Music, I can wish you, merry music while you're young
And wisdom, when your hair has turned to gray
But more I cannot wish you than to wish you find your love
Your own true love this day

[Outro]
With the sheepish eye and the look of the truth
And the strong arms to carry you away

[Verse 1]
You've got to give a little, take a little
And let your poor heart break a little
That's the story of, that's the glory of love
No, laugh a little, cry a little
Until the clouds roll by a little
That's the story of, that's the glory of love

[Chorus 1]
As long as there's the two of us
We've got the world and all it's charms
And when the world is through with us
We've got each other's arms
You've got to win a little, lose a little
Yes, and always have the blues a little
That's the story of, that's the glory of love

[Chorus 2]
As long as there's the two of us
We've got the world and all it's charms
But when the world is through with us
We've got each other's arms
You've got to win a little, lose a little
Yes, and always have the blues a little
That's the story of, that's the glory of love

[Outro]
That's the story of, and that's the glory of love

[Verse 1]
We three, we're all alone, living in a memory
My echo, my shadow and me
We three we're not a crowd, we're not even company
My echo, my shadow and me

[Chorus]
What good is the moonlight, the silvery moonlight
That shines above
I walk with my shadow
I talk with my echo but where is the one I love

[Verse 2]
We three, we'll wait for you
Even till eternity
My echo, my shadow and me
We three, we're all alone, living in a memory
My echo, my shadow and me

[Chorus]
What good is the moonlight, the silvery moonlight
That shines above
I walk with my shadow
I talk with my echo but where is the one I love

[Outro]
We three, we'll wait for you
Even till eternity
My echo, my shadow and me
We'll be here waiting
My echo, my shadow and me

[Verse 1]
You got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with mister inbetween
You got to spread joy up to the maximum
Bring gloom down to the minimum
And have faith, or pandemonium
Liable to walk upon the scene

[Chorus]
To illustrate my last remark
Jonah in the whale, Noah in the ark
What did they do, just when everything looked so dark?
Man, they said, we better

[Verse 2]
Ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with mister inbetween

[Chorus]
To illustrate my last remark
Jonah in the whale, Noah in the ark
What did they do, just when everything looked so dark?
Man, they said, we better

[Outro]
Ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with mister inbetween

[Verse 1]
At last I've wake up to see what you've done
So what can I do but pack up and run
I know the rules, go get yourself another fool
You said that you loved me, I'm yours to command
But your kind of loving, my heart couldn't stand
You used me for a tool, go get yourself another fool

[Chorus]
And now, now that we're through
You say, you meant to be true
Oh, but deep in your heart
You know that our love could never grow

[Verse 2]
I tried to believe you that we'd never part
But your kind of loving just broke my poor heart
Now I know the rules, go get yourself another fool

[Chorus]
And now, now that we're through
You say, you meant to be true
Oh, but deep in your heart
You know that our love could never grow

[Outro]
Well I tried to believe you that we'd never part
But your kind of loving just broke my poor heart
Well I know the rules, go get yourself another fool
Yeah you better get yourself, get yourself
Another fool

[Verse 1]
The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring
And you appear in all your splendor
My one and only love
The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms
I feel your lips, so warm and tender
My one and only love

[Chorus]
The touch of your hand is like heaven
A heaven that I've never known
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own

[Verse 2]
You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender
My one and only love

[Chorus]
The touch of your hand is like heaven
A heaven that I've never known
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own

[Outro]
You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender
My one and only love

[Verse 1]
I spent the whole day in my head
Do a little spring cleanin'
I'm always too busy dreamin'
Well, maybe I should wake up instead
A lot of things I regret, but I just say I forget
Why can't it just be easy?
Why does everybody need me to stay?
Oh, I hate the feelin'
When you're high, but you're underneath the ceilin'
Got the cards in my hand, I hate dealin', yeah
Get everything I need, then I'm gone, but it ain't stealin'
Can I get a break?
I wish that I could just get out my goddamn way
What is there to say?
There ain't a better time than today
Well, maybe I'll lay down for a little, yeah
Instead of always tryin' to figure everything out
And all I do is say sorry
Half the time I don't even know what I'm sayin' it about

[Chorus]
Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flyin', oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?

[Verse 2]
When it ain't that bad
It could always be worse
I'm runnin' out of gas, hardly anything left
Hope I make it home from work
Well, so tired of bein' so tired
Why I gotta build somethin' beautiful just to go set it on fire?
I'm no liar, but
Sometimes the truth don't sound like the truth
Maybe 'cause it ain't
I just love the way it sound when I say it, yeah
It's what I do
If you know me, it ain't anything new
Wake up to the moon, haven't seen the sun in a while
But I heard that the sky's still blue, yeah
I heard they don't talk about me too much no more
And that's the problem with a closed door

[Chorus]
Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flyin', oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?

[Verse 3]
There's a whole lot more for me waitin' on the other side
I'm always wonderin' if it feel like summer
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
I'll finally discover
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
Then I'll finally discover
That it ain't that bad, ain't so bad
Well, it ain't that bad, mm
At least it don't gotta be no more

[Outro]
No more, no more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hey, hey
Mm, hey, mm, mm, mm

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I’m not sleepy and there is no place I’m going to
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you

Though I know that evenin’s empire has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me, I’m branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty street’s too dead for dreaming

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I’m not sleepy and there is no place I’m going to
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you

Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin’ ship
My senses have been stripped, my hands can’t feel to grip
My toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin’
I’m ready to go anywhere, I’m ready for to fade
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way
I promise to go under it
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I’m not sleepy and there is no place I’m going to
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you

Though you might hear laughin’, spinnin’, swingin’ madly across the sun
It’s not aimed at anyone, it’s just escapin’ on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facin’
And if you hear vague traces of skippin’ reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it’s just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn’t pay it any mind
It’s just a shadow you’re seein’ that he’s chasing

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I’m not sleepy and there is no place I’m going to
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you

Then take me disappearin’ through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I’m not sleepy and there is no place I’m going to
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you
’Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”

And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured
I’ll always do my best for her, on that I give my word
In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”

Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place where it’s always safe and warm
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”

I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes an’ blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”

Suddenly I turned around and she was standin’ there
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”
Now there’s a wall between us, somethin’ there’s been lost
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”

Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much, it’s doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”

I’ve heard newborn babies wailin’ like a mournin’ dove
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”

In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation an’ they gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”

Well, I’m livin’ in a foreign country but I’m bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor’s edge, someday I’ll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”
My love she speaks like silence
Without ideals or violence
She doesn’t have to say she’s faithful
Yet she’s true, like ice, like fire
People carry roses
Make promises by the hours
My love she laughs like the flowers
Valentines can’t buy her

In the dime stores and bus stations
People talk of situations
Read books, repeat quotations
Draw conclusions on the wall
Some speak of the future
My love she speaks softly
She knows there’s no success like failure
And that failure’s no success at all

The cloak and dagger dangles
Madams light the candles
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Even the pawn must hold a grudge
Statues made of matchsticks
Crumble into one another
My love winks, she does not bother
She knows too much to argue or to judge
The bridge at midnight trembles
The country doctor rambles
Bankers’ nieces seek perfection
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring
The wind howls like a hammer
The night blows cold and rainy
My love she’s like some raven
At my window with a broken wing
You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
And you say, “Who is that man?”
You try so hard
But you don’t understand
Just what you’ll say
When you get home

Because something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You raise up your head
And you ask, “Is this where it is?”
And somebody points to you and says
“It’s his”
And you say, “What’s mine?”
And somebody else says, “Where what is?”
And you say, “Oh my God
Am I here all alone?”
Because something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You hand in your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
And says, “How does it feel
To be such a freak?”
And you say, “Impossible”
As he hands you a bone

Because something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
To get you facts
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
Anyway they already expect you
To just give a check
To tax-deductible charity organizations
You’ve been with the professors
And they’ve all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
You’ve been through all of
F. Scott Fitzgerald’s books
You’re very well read
It’s well known

Because something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says, “Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan”

Because something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
Now you see this one-eyed midget
Shouting the word “NOW”
And you say, “For what reason?”
And he says, “How?”
And you say, “What does this mean?”
And he screams back, “You’re a cow
Give me some milk
Or else go home”

Because something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Well, you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There ought to be a law
Against you comin’ around
You should be made
To wear earphones

Because something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
It ain’t no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don’t matter, anyhow
An’ it ain’t no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don’t know by now
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I’ll be gone
You’re the reason I’m trav’lin’ on
Don’t think twice, it’s all right

It ain’t no use in turnin’ on your light, babe
That light I never knowed
An’ it ain’t no use in turnin’ on your light, babe
I’m on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was somethin’ you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talkin’ anyway
So don’t think twice, it’s all right

It ain’t no use in callin’ out my name, gal
Like you never did before
It ain’t no use in callin’ out my name, gal
I can’t hear you anymore
I’m a-thinkin’ and a-wond’rin’ all the way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I’m told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don’t think twice, it’s all right
I’m walkin’ down that long, lonesome road, babe
Where I’m bound, I can’t tell
But goodbye’s too good a word, gal
So I’ll just say fare thee well
I ain’t sayin’ you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don’t mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don’t think twice, it’s all right
I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
No, I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
Well, I wake in the morning
Fold my hands and pray for rain
I got a head full of ideas
That are drivin’ me insane
It’s a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor
I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more

I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more
No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more
Well, he hands you a nickel
He hands you a dime
He asks you with a grin
If you’re havin’ a good time
Then he fines you every time you slam the door
I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more

I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more
No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more
Well, he puts his cigar
Out in your face just for kicks
His bedroom window
It is made out of bricks
The National Guard stands around his door
Ah, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more
I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more
No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more
Well, she talks to all the servants
About man and God and law
Everybody says
She’s the brains behind pa
She’s sixty-eight, but she says she’s twenty-four
I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more

I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
No, I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
Well, I try my best
To be just like I am
But everybody wants you
To be just like them
They sing while you slave and I just get bored
I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
Your breath is sweet
Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth
On the pillow where you lie
But I don’t sense affection
No gratitude or love
Your loyalty is not to me
But to the stars above

One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee ’fore I go
To the valley below

Your daddy he’s an outlaw
And a wanderer by trade
He’ll teach you how to pick and choose
And how to throw the blade
He oversees his kingdom
So no stranger does intrude
His voice it trembles as he calls out
For another plate of food
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee ’fore I go
To the valley below

Your sister sees the future
Like your mama and yourself
You’ve never learned to read or write
There’s no books upon your shelf
And your pleasure knows no limits
Your voice is like a meadowlark
But your heart is like an ocean
Mysterious and dark

One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee ’fore I go
To the valley below
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn’t you?
People’d call, say, “Beware doll, you’re bound to fall”
You thought they were all kiddin’ you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin’ out
Now you don’t talk so loud
Now you don’t seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

You’ve gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
And now you find out you’re gonna have to get used to it
You said you’d never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He’s not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And ask him do you want to make a deal?
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
When they all come down and did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain’t no good
You shouldn’t let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain’t it hard when you discover that
He really wasn’t where it’s at
After he took from you everything he could steal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They’re drinkin’, thinkin’ that they got it made
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things
But you’d better lift your diamond ring, you’d better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can’t refuse
When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You’re invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
They say ev'rything can be replaced
Yet ev’ry distance is not near
So I remember ev'ry face
Of ev'ry man who put me here
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

They say ev’ry man needs protection
They say ev'ry man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Standing next to me in this lonely crowd
Is a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him shout so loud
Crying out that he was framed
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
Do you love me, or are you just extending goodwill?
Do you need me half as bad as you say, or are you just feeling guilt?
I’ve been burned before and I know the score
So you won’t hear me complain
Will I be able to count on you
Or is your love in vain?

Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind
Or must I explain?
Will you let me be myself
Or is your love in vain?

Well I’ve been to the mountain and I’ve been in the wind
I’ve been in and out of happiness
I have dined with kings, I’ve been offered wings
And I’ve never been too impressed

All right, I’ll take a chance, I will fall in love with you
If I’m a fool you can have the night, you can have the morning too
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow
Do you understand my pain?
Are you willing to risk it all
Or is your love in vain?

[Verse 1]
Well I just reached a place
Where I can’t stay awake
I got to leave you baby
Before my heart will break
I’m going
I’m going
I’m gone

[Verse 2]
Come over here baby
‘Cause I’m telling you this
You got to believe it
Just give me one more kiss
I’m going
I’m going
I’m gone

[Verse 3]
Fix me one more drink baby
And hold me one more time
But don’t get to close
To make me change my mind
I’m going
I’m going
I’m gone

[Bridge]
Now my Mama always said “someday true you gotta follow your heart
You’ll be fine at the end of the line
All that’s gold wasn’t meant to shine
Just don’t put your horse in front of your cart.”
Oh

[Verse 4]
Now from Boston to Birmingham
Is a two day ride
But I got to be going now
‘Cause I’m so dissatisfied
I’m going
I’m going
I’m gone

[Outro]
Going, going
Going, going, gone
Going, going
Going, going, gone
Going, going
Going, going, gone
Going, going
Going, going, gone
How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
Yes, ’n’ how many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, ’n’ how many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they’re forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowin’ in the wind
The answer is blowin’ in the wind

How many years can a mountain exist
Before it’s washed to the sea?
Yes, ’n’ how many years can some people exist
Before they’re allowed to be free?
Yes, ’n’ how many times can a man turn his head
Pretending he just doesn’t see?
The answer, my friend, is blowin’ in the wind
The answer is blowin’ in the wind

How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, ’n’ how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, ’n’ how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin’ in the wind
The answer is blowin’ in the wind
Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Ev’rybody knows
That Baby’s got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

Queen Mary, she’s my friend
Yes, I believe I’ll go see her again
Nobody has to guess
That Baby can’t be blessed
Till she sees finally that she’s like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl
It was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what’s worse
Is this pain in here
I can’t stay in here
Ain’t it clear that—

I just can’t fit
Yes, I believe it’s time for us to quit
When we meet again
Introduced as friends
Please don’t let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world
Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do
You make love just like a woman, yes, you do
Then you ache just like a woman
But you break just like a little girl
They sat together in the park
As the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones
’Twas then he felt alone and wished that he’d gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate

They walked along by the old canal
A little confused, I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin’ bright
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate

A saxophone someplace far off played
As she was walkin’ by the arcade
As the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin’ up
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate

He woke up, the room was bare
He didn’t see her anywhere
He told himself he didn’t care, pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate
He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in
Maybe she’ll pick him out again, how long must he wait
Once more for a simple twist of fate

People tell me it’s a sin
To know and feel too much within
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring
She was born in spring, but I was born too late
Blame it on a simple twist of fate
“There must be some way out of here,” said the joker to the thief
“There’s too much confusion, I can’t get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth”

“No reason to get excited,” the thief, he kindly spoke
“There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we’ve been through that, and this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late”

All along the watchtower, princes kept the view
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too

Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl
The guilty undertaker sighs
The lonesome organ grinder cries
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you
The cracked bells and washed-out horns
Blow into my face with scorn
But it’s not that way
I wasn’t born to lose you

I want you, I want you
I want you so bad
Honey, I want you

The drunken politician leaps
Upon the street where mothers weep
And the saviors who are fast asleep, they wait for you
And I wait for them to interrupt
Me drinkin’ from my broken cup
And ask me to
Open up the gate for you

I want you, I want you
I want you so bad
Honey, I want you
How all my fathers, they’ve gone down
True love they’ve been without it
But all their daughters put me down
’Cause I don’t think about it

Well, I return to the Queen of Spades
And talk with my chambermaid
She knows that I’m not afraid to look at her
She is good to me
And there’s nothing she doesn’t see
She knows where I’d like to be
But it doesn’t matter

I want you, I want you
I want you so bad
Honey, I want you

Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit
He spoke to me, I took his flute
No, I wasn’t very cute to him, was I?
But I did it, though, because he lied
Because he took you for a ride
And because time was on his side
And because I . . 

I want you, I want you
I want you so bad
Honey, I want you
I ain’t lookin’ to compete with you
Beat or cheat or mistreat you
Simplify you, classify you
Deny, defy or crucify you
All I really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you

No, and I ain’t lookin’ to fight with you
Frighten you or tighten you
Drag you down or drain you down
Chain you down or bring you down
All I really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you

I ain’t lookin’ to block you up
Shock or knock or lock you up
Analyze you, categorize you
Finalize you or advertise you
All I really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you
I don’t want to straight-face you
Race or chase you, track or trace you
Or disgrace you or displace you
Or define you or confine you
All I really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you

I don’t want to meet your kin
Make you spin or do you in
Or select you or dissect you
Or inspect you or reject you
All I really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you

I don’t want to fake you out
Take or shake or forsake you out
I ain’t lookin’ for you to feel like me
See like me or be like me
All I really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you
Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade, the child’s balloon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon
There is no sense in trying

Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fool’s gold mouthpiece the hollow horn
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
That he not busy being born is busy dying

Temptation’s page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan but unlike before
You discover that you’d just be one more
Person crying

So don’t fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
It’s alright, Ma, I’m only sighing
As some warn victory, some downfall
Private reasons great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don’t hate nothing at all
Except hatred

Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Make everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It’s easy to see without looking too far
That not much is really sacred

While preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the president of the United States
Sometimes must have to stand naked

An’ though the rules of the road have been lodged
It’s only people’s games that you got to dodge
And it’s alright, Ma, I can make it

Advertising signs they con
You into thinking you’re the one
That can do what’s never been done
That can win what’s never been won
Meantime life outside goes on
All around you
You lose yourself, you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks they really found you

A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit
To satisfy, insure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not forget
That it is not he or she or them or it
That you belong to

Although the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to

For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs, their destinies
Speak jealously of them that are free
Cultivate their flowers to be
Nothing more than something they invest in

While some on principles baptized
To strict party platform ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize
And then say God bless him
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society’s pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole
That he’s in

But I mean no harm nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it’s alright, Ma, if I can’t please him

Old lady judges watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn’t talk, it swears
Obscenity, who really cares
Propaganda, all is phony

While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer’s pride, security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death’s honesty
Won’t fall upon them naturally
Life sometimes must get lonely

My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Graveyards, false gods, I scuff
At pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Say okay, I have had enough, what else can you show me?

And if my thought-dreams could be seen
They’d probably put my head in a guillotine
But it’s alright, Ma, it’s life, and life only
May God bless and keep you always
May your wishes all come true
May you always do for others
And let others do for you
May you build a ladder to the stars
And climb on every rung
May you stay forever young
Forever young, forever young
May you stay forever young

May you grow up to be righteous
May you grow up to be true
May you always know the truth
And see the lights surrounding you
May you always be courageous
Stand upright and be strong
May you stay forever young
Forever young, forever young
May you stay forever young

May your hands always be busy
May your feet always be swift
May you have a strong foundation
When the winds of changes shift
May your heart always be joyful
May your song always be sung
May you stay forever young
Forever young, forever young
May you stay forever young
Come gather ’round people
Wherever you roam
And admit that the waters
Around you have grown
And accept it that soon
You’ll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth savin’
Then you better start swimmin’ or you’ll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin’

Come writers and critics
Who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance won’t come again
And don’t speak too soon
For the wheel’s still in spin
And there’s no tellin’ who that it’s namin’
For the loser now will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin’

Come senators, congressmen
Please heed the call
Don’t stand in the doorway
Don’t block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
There’s a battle outside and it is ragin’
It’ll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin’
Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And don’t criticize
What you can’t understand
Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly agin’
Please get out of the new one if you can’t lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin’

The line it is drawn
The curse it is cast
The slow one now
Will later be fast
As the present now
Will later be past
The order is rapidly fadin’
And the first one now will later be last
For the times they are a-changin’
Oh God said to Abraham, “Kill me a son”
Abe says, “Man, you must be puttin’ me on”
God say, “No.” Abe say, “What?”
God say, “You can do what you want Abe, but
The next time you see me comin’ you better run”
Well Abe says, “Where do you want this killin’ done?”
God says, “Out on Highway 61”

Well Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose
Welfare Department they wouldn’t give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard where can I go
Howard said there’s only one place I know
Sam said tell me quick man I got to run
Ol’ Howard just pointed with his gun
And said that way down on Highway 61

Well Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
I got forty red, white and blue shoestrings
And a thousand telephones that don’t ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things
And Louie the King said let me think for a minute son
And he said yes I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61
Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren’t right
My complexion she said is much too white
He said come here and step into the light, he says hmm you’re right
Let me tell the second mother this has been done
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61

Now the rovin’ gambler he was very bored
He was tryin’ to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said I never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yes I think it can be very easily done
We’ll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And have it on Highway 61
I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
No, I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
Well, I wake in the morning
Fold my hands and pray for rain
I got a head full of ideas
That are drivin’ me insane
It’s a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor
I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more

I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more
No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more
Well, he hands you a nickel
He hands you a dime
He asks you with a grin
If you’re havin’ a good time
Then he fines you every time you slam the door
I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more

I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more
No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more
Well, he puts his cigar
Out in your face just for kicks
His bedroom window
It is made out of bricks
The National Guard stands around his door
Ah, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more
I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more
No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more
Well, she talks to all the servants
About man and God and law
Everybody says
She’s the brains behind pa
She’s sixty-eight, but she says she’s twenty-four
I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more

I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
No, I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
Well, I try my best
To be just like I am
But everybody wants you
To be just like them
They sing while you slave and I just get bored
I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams
In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams

I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

Think I’ll go out and go for a walk
Not much happenin’ here, nothin’ ever does
Besides, if she wakes up now, she’ll just want me to talk
I got nothin’ to say, ’specially about whatever was

I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

Took an untrodden path once, where the swift don’t win the race
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth
Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice’s beautiful face
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

Outside of two men on a train platform there’s nobody in sight
They’re waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track
The world could come to an end tonight, but that’s all right
She should still be there sleepin’ when I get back

I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

Noontime, and I’m still pushin’ myself along the road, the darkest part
Into the narrow lanes, I can’t stumble or stay put
Someone else is speakin’ with my mouth, but I’m listening only to my heart
I’ve made shoes for everyone, even you, while I still go barefoot

I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives
Man thinks ’cause he rules the earth he can do with it as he please
And if things don’t change soon, he will
Oh, man has invented his doom
First step was touching the moon

Now, there’s a woman on my block
She just sit there as the night grows still
She say who gonna take away his license to kill?

Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
And they set him on a path where he’s bound to get ill
Then they bury him with stars
Sell his body like they do used cars

Now, there’s a woman on my block
She just sit there facin’ the hill
She say who gonna take away his license to kill?

Now, he’s hell-bent for destruction, he’s afraid and confused
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill
All he believes are his eyes
And his eyes, they just tell him lies
But there’s a woman on my block
Sitting there in a cold chill
She say who gonna take away his license to kill?

Ya may be a noisemaker, spirit maker
Heartbreaker, backbreaker
Leave no stone unturned
May be an actor in a plot
That might be all that you got
’Til your error you clearly learn

Now he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And when he sees his reflection, he’s fulfilled
Oh, man is opposed to fair play
He wants it all and he wants it his way

Now, there’s a woman on my block
She just sit there as the night grows still
She say who gonna take away his license to kill?
Go ’way from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I’m not the one you want, babe
I’m not the one you need
You say you’re lookin’ for someone
Never weak but always strong
To protect you an’ defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door
But it ain’t me, babe
No, no, no, it ain’t me, babe
It ain’t me you’re lookin’ for, babe

Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I’m not the one you want, babe
I will only let you down
You say you’re lookin’ for someone
Who will promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone who will die for you an’ more
But it ain’t me, babe
No, no, no, it ain’t me, babe
It ain’t me you’re lookin’ for, babe
Go melt back into the night, babe
Everything inside is made of stone
There’s nothing in here moving
An’ anyway I’m not alone
You say you’re lookin' for someone
Who’ll pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
An’ to come each time you call
A lover for your life an’ nothing more
But it ain’t me, babe
No, no, no, it ain’t me, babe
It ain’t me you’re lookin’ for, babe

[Intro]
Remember when you told me to kiss you
Kiss you, kiss you, kiss you, kiss you, kiss you 'til you get wet
Remember when you told me to kiss you
Kiss you, kiss you, kiss you, kiss you, kiss you ’til you get wet

[Verse 1: Ray Lavender]
2020 and I'm still blind
I just can't see how good you are
Right in front of me babe
My guard’s down when it comes time
To fight for our loving babe
When you're so worth it

[Pre-Chorus: Ray Lavender]

[Verse 2: Akon]
Got two legs but I’m not runnin' after you right now
Watch you beg while I'm drillin' you and puttin’ it down

Give your the best you ever had, oh oh

[Pre-Chorus: Ray Lavender]

Kiss you, kiss you, kiss you, kiss you, kiss you 'til you get wet
That's all I wanna do babe, yeah
All over you babe

[Chorus: Ray Lavender & Akon]
Yeah
Yeah
(Smack it, move it, rub it
Smack it, move it, rub it
Smack it, move it, rub it
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap)
Remember when you told me to kiss you
Kiss you, kiss you, kiss you, kiss you, kiss you 'til you get wet
Come you masters of war
You that build all the guns
You that build the death planes
You that build the big bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks

You that never done nothin’
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it’s your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly

Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain
You fasten the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
As young people’s blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud

You’ve thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain’t worth the blood
That runs in your veins

How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I’m young
You might say I’m unlearned
But there’s one thing I know
Though I’m younger than you
Even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do
Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul

And I hope that you die
And your death’ll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I’ll watch while you’re lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I’ll stand o’er your grave
’Til I’m sure that you’re dead
You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
And you say, “Who is that man?”
You try so hard
But you don’t understand
Just what you’ll say
When you get home

Because something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You raise up your head
And you ask, “Is this where it is?”
And somebody points to you and says
“It’s his”
And you say, “What’s mine?”
And somebody else says, “Where what is?”
And you say, “Oh my God
Am I here all alone?”
Because something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You hand in your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
And says, “How does it feel
To be such a freak?”
And you say, “Impossible”
As he hands you a bone

Because something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
To get you facts
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
Anyway they already expect you
To just give a check
To tax-deductible charity organizations
You’ve been with the professors
And they’ve all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
You’ve been through all of
F. Scott Fitzgerald’s books
You’re very well read
It’s well known

Because something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says, “Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan”

Because something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
Now you see this one-eyed midget
Shouting the word “NOW”
And you say, “For what reason?”
And he says, “How?”
And you say, “What does this mean?”
And he screams back, “You’re a cow
Give me some milk
Or else go home”

Because something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Well, you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There ought to be a law
Against you comin’ around
You should be made
To wear earphones

Because something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
Well, if you’re travelin’ in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see if she’s wearing a coat so warm
To keep her from the howlin’ winds

Please see for me if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair hangs long
That’s the way I remember her best

I’m a-wonderin’ if she remembers me at all
Many times I’ve often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day

So if you’re travelin’ in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

[Verse 1]
Well, the sweet pretty things are in bed now, of course
The city fathers they’re trying to endorse
The reincarnation of Paul Revere’s horse
But the town has no need to be nervous

[Verse 2]
That Belle Starr she hands down her wits
To Jezebel the nun she violently knits
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits
At the head of the chamber of commerce

[Chorus]
Mama’s in the fact’ry, she ain’t got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley, he’s lookin’ for the fuse
I’m in the kitchen with the tombstone blues

[Verse 3]
We're standing in the penny arcade
Screaming she moans, “I’ve just been made”
Send for the doctor who pull down the shade
Saying, “Don't let the boys in”

[Verse 4]
Well, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
Walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
“Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
You won't die, it’s not poison”

[Chorus]
Mama’s in the fact’ry, she ain’t got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley, lookin’ hard for the fuse
I’m in the kitchen with the tombstone blues

[Verse 5]
John the Baptist after torturing a thief
Looks up at his hero the Commander-in-Chief
“Tell me great hero, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?”

[Verse 6]
Well, he Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly, “Death to all those who would whimper and cry”
And dropping a barbell he points to the sky
“The sun’s not yellow it’s chicken”

[Chorus]
Well, Mama’s in the fact’ry, she ain’t got no shoes
Daddy’s in the hallway, he’s lookin’ hard for the fuse
I’m in the kitchen with the tombstone blues, well

[Verse 7]
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks home and the college

[Verse 8]
Well, I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you dear lady from goin' insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge

[Chorus]
Mama’s in the fact’ry, she ain’t got no shoes
Daddy’s in the hallway, lookin’ hard for the fuse
I’m in the kitchen with the tombstone blues, ah yeah

[Verse]
They saw the lies I've told, make things right before I'm old
Nothing left for us to say, broken down on the freeway
Roadside I see things clearer
Outside my rearview mirror
Slave to the road, stuck by your side
I'm nothing but a passenger along for the ride
I'm nothing but a passenger along for the ride

[Chorus]
When I peer through my rearview mirror
Getting smaller as I disappear
Suddenly everything is so much clearer
And all I'm left with is my good friend fear
And promises of tears, and promises of tears

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse]
They saw the lies I've told, make things right before I'm old
Nothing left for us to say, broken down on the freeway
Roadside I see things clearer
Outside my rearview mirror
Slave to the road, stuck by your side
I'm nothing but a passenger along for the ride
I'm nothing but a passenger along for the ride

[Chorus]
When I peer through my rearview mirror
Getting smaller as I disappear
Suddenly everything is so much clearer
And all I'm left with is my good friend fear
And promises of tears, and promises of tears

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse]
I think ways have hurt you
You came to my rescue
This will be a fine morning
The mighty old high I’m calling
Then I came to see
You bring out the best in me
Talk about a fine morning
The mighty old high I’m calling

[Pre Chorus]
A gift on a rainy day
Is something to believe in
That's the beauty of it all
And all because of you

[Chorus]
Hey!, I will prowl
Oh, I will prowl
Baby I'll learn to swim in my crocodile tears
I'm gonna feel it
And I got a feeling
Change gon' come to wipe my crocodile tears a-way

[Post-Chorus]
You wipe my crocodile tears a-way
You wipe my crocodile tears a-way

[Verse]
I think ways have hurt you
You came to my rescue
This will be a fine morning
The mighty old high I’m calling
Then I came to see
You bring out the best in me
Talk about a fine morning
The mighty old high I’m calling

[Pre Chorus]
A gift on a rainy day
Is something to believe in
That's the beauty of it all
And all because of you

[Chorus]
Hey!, I will prowl
Oh, I will prowl
Baby I'll learn to swim in my crocodile tears
I'm gonna feel it
And I got a feeling
Change gon' come to wipe my crocodile tears a-way

[Post-Chorus]
You wipe my crocodile tears a-way
You wipe my crocodile tears a-way

[Verse]
I'm tired of being down on my knees
With the weight of the world coming down on me
She says there's always someone better waiting for her
That I was so lucky to get her

[Pre Chorus]
Even though I, I wanna cry
I wonder why all of my tears are dry
I just don't dare to show I care
I got nothing left to spare

[Chorus]
I wonder why I try
I wonder why
When nothing pleases a woman
There's just no pleasing a woman

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse]
I'm tired of being down on my knees
With the weight of the world coming down on me
She says there's always someone better waiting for her
That I was so lucky to get her

[Pre Chorus]
Even though I, I wanna cry
I wonder why all of my tears are dry
I just don't dare to show I care
I got nothing left to spare

[Chorus]
I wonder why I try
I wonder why
When nothing pleases a woman
There's just no pleasing a woman

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse]
Some say that love is a motherfucker
But you'll know better than any other ooohhh
Give Up The Ghost
Ain't gonna cry for the photograph
Lost something that I never had ooohhh
Give Up The Ghost


Feel the lungs when you fight me when you want it
Feel the sting and you know that I lost you on my due
Give Up The Ghost

[Chorus]
Walk the days trying to shame this misery
But tonight is not a moment to set you free
Give Up The Ghost
Give Up The Ghost

Face Down in the pool of a misery
Now I know you are bad what you've done to me ooohhh
Give Up The Ghost
Now you're bad feeling the ash like a cigarette
Shot them down but now I'm back from the dead ooohhh
Give Up The Ghost
Give Up The Ghost
Gotta Give Up The Ghost

[Outro]
Walk The Days trying to shame this misery
Tonight is not a moment to set you free
Gotta Give Up The Ghost

[Verse 1]
So you're leaving in the morning on the early train
I could say everything's alright
And I could pretend and say goodbye
Got your ticket
Got your suitcase
Got your leaving smile
I could say that's the way it goes
And I could pretend and you won't know
That I was lying

[Chorus]
Cause I can't stop loving you
No I can't stop loving you
No I won't stop loving you
Why should I?

[Verse 2]
We took a taxi to the station, not a word was said
And I saw you walk across the road
For maybe the last time I don't know
Feeling humble
I heard a rumble
On the railway track
And when I hear that whistle blow
I'll walk away and you won't know
That I'll be crying

[Chorus]
Cause I can't stop loving you
No I can't stop loving you
No I won't stop loving you
Why should I?

[Bridge]
(Even try) I'll always be here by your side
(Why, why, why) I never wanted to say goodbye
(Why even try) I'm always here if you change, change your mind

[Verse 3]
So you're leaving in the morning on the early train
I could say everything's alright
And I could pretend and say goodbye
But that would be lying

[Chorus]
Cause I can't stop loving you
No I can't stop loving you
No I won't stop loving you
Why should I?

[Verse 1]
Less talkin', more in the bank
Bomb weed rolled now I'm pourin' the drink
I'on got to go to the store cause I'm laced
It ain't even come out but you already late
Bad bitch, nice body, cute face
Win the race, I doubt if you niggas place
I ain't get this far by mistake
What you dream of, I done already made
Need a hit, who you call for the case?
Young OG, gotta ball with the greats
'Nother tour mean larger estates
Always on go, never tried using brakes
I'm advanced, no time for the basics
Gotta take a flight on a regular basis
Bank account full of all blue faces
Nigga, just face it

[Chorus]
I'll be good
That's right, we just throw the gang up
Y'all know we don't fuck with strangers
'Cause my niggas got drink
And my bitches keep something rolled up so
I'll be good
That's right, we just throw the gang up
Y'all know we don't fuck with strangers
'Cause my niggas got drink
And my bitches keep something rolled up so
I'll be-

[Verse 2]
Good at six joints in the morning
Shawty give me head while a nigga still yawning
200K for performing
Do this all the time and it still ain't get boring
Hear the crowd cheer when I'm scorin'
Smokin' wit' Wiz, she ain't thinkin' bout her boyfriend
Sent a text, she ignorin' it
They be knockin' on the door, got her knees where the floor is
Whip foreign, quit stalling
Don't be lookin' at your friend, bitch, join in
I'ma star so we ain't recording
They up in it, get a bit distorted
Got drink, got jars we could blow
Baby, I'ma boss or don, I suppose
We go shopping in the store when it's closed
Girl, you already know that

[Chorus]
I'll be good
That's right, we just throw the gang up
Y'all know we don't fuck with strangers
'Cause my niggas got drink
And my bitches keep something rolled up so
I'll be good
That's right, we just throw the gang up
Y'all know we don't fuck with strangers
'Cause my niggas got drink
And my bitches keep something rolled up so
I'll be-

[Interlude]
Hahaha, ah-ha-ha, you fucking punks
You thought you had it didn't you?
You thought you fucking had it
Not this time, hahahaha, ahhh

[Outro]
I'll be good
I'll be good
I'll be good
I'll be good
Aretha and to all of the musicians in this great choir
That took me all the way back to the living room at home
When she was about 6 and 7 years of age
I saw you cry
And I saw you respond
But I was just about to bust wide open
You talk about being moved

Not only because Aretha, my daughter, Aretha is just a strong singer
Reverend James Cleveland knows about those things
When James came to prepare Aqua for a gospel broadcast
Which is still in existence
And he and Aretha used to go in the living room
And spend hours in there
Singing different songs
She's influenced greatly by James
If you wanna know the truth
She ain't never left the church
Left me like a fish on land
Left me like a fish on land
Left me like a fish on land
Left me like a fish on land
Were just waiting on a friend
You were just waiting on a friend

Maybe we should stop now
What we gonna do this for
Maybe we should stop now
What we gonna do this for
Maybe we should stop now
What we gonna do this for
Maybe we should stop now
You don't love me anymore

You left me like a fish on land
You left me like a fish on land
Shaking to shake your hand

Maybe we should stop now
What we gonna do this for
Maybe we should stop now
What we gonna do this for
Maybe we should stop now
What we gonna do this for
Maybe we should stop now
I don't love you anymore
You left me like a fish on land
You left me like a fish on

Sometimes I get stuck in another moment
It isn't mine, babe, I know I don't own it
But can a young one fantasize on it
Wonder where the truth lies, bet it lies on me
And I bet I got it on me
Metaphorical gun when I'm speaking in tongues
And you know who I am, I ain't the only one shaking
Fish on land
It feels like I just don't belong
But still going 20 years strong
And what the hell been going on
Fish on land

You left me like a fish on land
You left me like a fish on land
You left me like a fish on land
You left me like a fish on land

[Verse 1]
How they got inside, oh, really, I don't know
Can't keep lettin' randoms up inside your home
You drink too much to know, you drink too much to know
Spirits in your blood, it's seeping through your soul
Garden needs some water, garden needs some water
Look up to the sky and I feel closer to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Get on, get even
Get on with your killer two-piece
Look up for me
Not far, baby, even when you leave

[Chorus]
Hmm-mmh
What happen under the moon
It stays under the moon (Moon)
It stays under the moon (Moon)

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna get high, high
I wanna get high
I wanna get high, high
I wanna get high

[Verse 2]
Me, I'm gonna have less than a little bit
Or I might just take the rest and a little bit
We all know how it ends when you're giving in
Fuck it, for the night, we can live in it
Under the same sky when you're missin' it
Look at what you did again
Inside 'til the morning, 'til I feel like
'Til the moon's out, 'til the lights out, nah, nah

[Pre-Chorus]
Get on, get even
Get on with your killer two (Two-piece)
Get on the street (Yeah)
Not far even when you leave
When you leave

[Chorus]
What happen under the moon
It stays under the moon
It stays under the moon

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna get high, high
I wanna get high
I wanna get high, high
I wanna get high
I wanna get high, high
I wanna get high

[Outro]
I wanna get high, high
I wanna get high
I wanna get high, high
I wanna get high

Fans at my show
Throwin', Tom Brady all the loads
I think she pregnant
Cause I can't pull off her

I've been living life like a young boy
Stuffing money in my jeans like a young boy
Tell her that we live like a young boy
The backyard at the mansion got a

She said my dick
I have a friend who sits at the corner lots
Selling pills to the girls
When they cross the block
I told him he should quit that
Sketchy scene
He said nothing compares
To the fever dream
It's what I do
I wait for you

I know a girl who stays still on Sunday night
Because her boy hits hard in the morning light
He told her everything ends
When you reach that thrill
He told her nothing exists
Past the window sill
It's nothing new
I wait for you
I wait for you

I wanna tell my baby to pretend
That every word I say is what I really meant
And when I get my head back on all right
Then we can be together for another night
And we can have those dreams like no one else
It's just one more reason to control myself
Its just one more reason to control yourself
It's just one more reason to control myself
It's what I do
I wait for you
I wait for you
I wait for you
I wait for you
I wait for you
Part. 1 (Big Boi ft. Sleepy Brown - The Way You Move)

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxing, OutKast is everlasting
Not clashing, not at all
But see my nigga went to do a little acting
Now that's for anyone asking, give me one pass 'em
Drip drip drop, there goes an eargasm
Now you cumming out the side of your face
We tapping right into your memory banks - thanks!
So click it or ticket, let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattling, like two midgets in the backseat rassling
Speakerboxxx vibrate the tag
Make it sound like aluminum cans in a bag
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
I like the way you move
I like the way you move wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way you move wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
The whole room fell silent, the girls all paused with glee
Turning left, turning right, are they looking at me?
Well I was looking at them, there there on the dancefloor
Now they got me in the middle, feeling like a man-whore
Especially the big girl
Big girls need love too, no discrimination here squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
Let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them, give them
Something to remember, yell out
Timber when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath and exhale
Your ex-male friend boyfriend's boring as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail
On the low, ho

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
I like the way you move
I like the way you move wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way you move wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

[Verse 3: Sleepy Brown]
Hey baby, girl don't you stop it
Come on lady, dance all around me
You look so fine (look so fine) look so fine
You driving me out my mind (out of my mind)
Out my mind, ooooh baby
If I could I would just be with you baby
Oooh cause you light me, and excite me
And you know, you got me baby, whoo!

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
I like the way you move
I like the way you move wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way you move wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

[Verse 1: André 3000]
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so, and this I know for sure (Uh)

You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it
But “got it” just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved
If what they say is “Nothing is forever”
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't want to hear me, you just want to dance

Now don't have me break this thing down for nothing
Now I want to see y'all on your baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor
Ah, here we go!

[Refrain: André 3000]
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it, sh-shake it, Shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it like a Polaroid picture, hey ya!
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, shake it (okay), shake it, sugar
Shake it like a Polaroid picture

[Bridge 2: André 3000]
Now all the Beyoncés and Lucy Lius
And baby dolls, get on the floor
You know what to do, oh, you know what to do
You know what to do

[Verse 2: André 3000]
You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it
But “got it” just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved

Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes

Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Okay now, ladies (Yeah?)
Now, we gon' break this thing down in just a few seconds
Now don't have me break this thing down for nothing
Now I want to see y'all on your baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor
Ah, here we go!

[Refrain: André 3000]
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it, sh-shake it, Shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it like a Polaroid picture, hey ya!
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, shake it (okay), shake it, sugar
Shake it like a Polaroid picture

[Bridge 2: André 3000]
Now all the Beyoncés and Lucy Lius
And baby dolls, get on the floor
You know what to do, oh, you know what to do
You know what to do

[Chorus: André 3000]
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh, hey ya!)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Oh, oh, uh-oh)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)

[Intro]
Mm
Yeah
Let me get it from right here
La Musica De Harry Fraud

[Verse 1]
She'll never be the same, once she give me the box
Look at my chain and the ice on my watch
Copy on the Gram all things that I rock
Baby, I'm the man and your nigga a flop
"Damn, Khalifa man, where you been at?"
Probably with your bitch, fucking where you pay rent at
If it's a race then I'm finna lap you
I'm in the gym everyday but I'm not finna scrap you
I'm too high to get violent
I'd rather smoke, find a bitch that I can ride with
Fake niggas, I don't vibe with
I'm getting paid, so the bank is where you find me
And a Playa, that's what I be
Makin' moves, stick and move like Ali
Real nigga, don't try me
I wear my own and a nigga ain't gotta sign me
Gang

[Interlude 1]
Tss, I was kicking it with this one bitch, man
I was over at her house and shit
She was, on my motherfucking nerves
And I'm like "Man, what the fuck is you even talking about?"
And I'm runnin' out of weed and shit too
That's the wrong time to fuck with a nigga like that, man
Hold on, baby, let me get my phone

[Verse 2]
Hold up, I gotta call a new bitch
'Cause I'm a gangsta and you be on some bullshit
She like "Naw, you leave me, imma lose it"
I'm like "Bitch, you just love me 'cause my music"
She like "Naw, I fuck witchu since way back
I can't even believe you would say that"
I'm like "Girl, you know what it is, you know the biz"
She like "Naw, they don't come as real as this"
She rolled the weed up, cook and cleaned the crib
Soon as we leave the club, I be in her ribs
She's like "Think you ever meet a better bitch?"
I fucked her one more time and got in a win

[Interlude 2]
I can't even lie, that shit was great
Shit, and if I ever need it again
Imma call you

[Outro]
Roll some, smoke some
Rolling Papers II
Roll some, smoke some
Rolling Papers II
Roll some, smoke some
Rolling Papers...II
I first heard this from Ric von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge
Ric is a blues guitar player. I met him one day on
The green pastures of the Harvard University. -

Baby let me follow you down, baby let me follow you down
Well I'll do anything in this godalmighty world
If you just let me follow you down

Can I come home with you, baby can I come home with you ?
Yes I'll do anything in this godalmighty world
If you just let me come home with you

Baby let me follow you down, baby let me follow you down
Well I'll do anything in this godalmighty world
If you just let me follow you down

Yes I'll do anything in this godalmighty world
If you just let me follow you down
She’s got everything she needs
She’s an artist, she don’t look back
She’s got everything she needs
She’s an artist, she don’t look back
She can take the dark out of the nighttime
And paint the daytime black

You will start out standing
Proud to steal her anything she sees
You will start out standing
Proud to steal her anything she sees
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole
Down upon your knees

She never stumbles
She’s got no place to fall
She never stumbles
She’s got no place to fall
She’s nobody’s child
The Law can’t touch her at all
She wears an Egyptian ring
That sparkles before she speaks
She wears an Egyptian ring
That sparkles before she speaks
She’s a hypnotist collector
You are a walking antique

Bow down to her on Sunday
Salute her when her birthday comes
Bow down to her on Sunday
Salute her when her birthday comes
For Halloween give her a trumpet
And for Christmas, buy her a drum
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun
Look out the saints are comin’ through
And it’s all over now, Baby Blue

The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
This sky, too, is folding under you
And it’s all over now, Baby Blue

All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
All your reindeer armies, are all going home
The lover who just walked out your door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it’s all over now, Baby Blue
Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you
Forget the dead you’ve left, they will not follow you
The vagabond who’s rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Strike another match, go start anew
And it’s all over now, Baby Blue
When she said
“Don’t waste your words, they’re just lies”
I cried she was deaf
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes
Then said, “What else you got left?”
It was then that I got up to leave
But she said, “Don’t forget
Everybody must give something back
For something they get”

I stood there and hummed
I tapped on her drum and asked her how come
And she buttoned her boot
And straightened her suit
Then she said, “Don’t get cute”
So I forced my hands in my pockets
And felt with my thumbs
And gallantly handed her
My very last piece of gum

She threw me outside
I stood in the dirt where ev’ryone walked
And after finding I’d
Forgotten my shirt
I went back and knocked
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it
And I tried to make sense
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
That leaned up against . . 
Her Jamaican rum
And when she did come, I asked her for some
She said, “No, dear”
I said, “Your words aren’t clear
You’d better spit out your gum”
She screamed till her face got so red
Then she fell on the floor
And I covered her up and then
Thought I’d go look through her drawer

And when I was through
I filled up my shoe
And brought it to you
And you, you took me in
You loved me then
You didn’t waste time
And I, I never took much
I never asked for your crutch
Now don’t ask for mine
Ain’t it just like the night to play tricks when you’re tryin' to be so quiet?
We sit here stranded, though we’re all doin’ our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin’ you to defy it
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there’s nothing, really nothing to turn off
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind

In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman’s bluff with the key chain
And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the “D” train
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
Ask himself if it’s him or them that’s really insane
Louise, she’s all right, she’s just near
She’s delicate and seems like the mirror
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna’s not here
The ghost of ’lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me
He’s sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall while I’m in the hall
How can I explain?
Oh, it’s so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn

Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say, “Jeeze
I can’t find my knees”
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel

The peddler now speaks to the countess who’s pretending to care for him
Sayin’, “Name me someone that’s not a parasite and I’ll go out and say a prayer for him”
But like Louise always says
“Ya can’t look at much, can ya man?”
As she, herself, prepares for him
And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road
He writes ev’rything’s been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain
They’re selling postcards of the hanging
They’re painting the passports brown
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Here comes the blind commissioner
They’ve got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
The other is in his pants
And the riot squad they’re restless
They need somewhere to go
As Lady and I look out tonight
From Desolation Row

Cinderella, she seems so easy
“It takes one to know one,” she smiles
And puts her hands in her back pockets
Bette Davis style
And in comes Romeo, he’s moaning
“You Belong to Me I Believe”
And someone says, “You’re in the wrong place my friend
You better leave”
And the only sound that’s left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row
Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
The fortune-telling lady
Has even taken all her things inside
All except for Cain and Abel
And the hunchback of Notre Dame
Everybody is making love
Or else expecting rain
And the Good Samaritan, he’s dressing
He’s getting ready for the show
He’s going to the carnival tonight
On Desolation Row

Now Ophelia, she’s ’neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday
She already is an old maid
To her, death is quite romantic
She wears an iron vest
Her profession’s her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness
And though her eyes are fixed upon
Noah’s great rainbow
She spends her time peeking
Into Desolation Row
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
With his friend, a jealous monk
He looked so immaculately frightful
As he bummed a cigarette
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet
Now you would not think to look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin
On Desolation Row

Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
They’re trying to blow it up
Now his nurse, some local loser
She’s in charge of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read
“Have Mercy on His Soul”
They all play on pennywhistles
You can hear them blow
If you lean your head out far enough
From Desolation Row
Across the street they’ve nailed the curtains
They’re getting ready for the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
A perfect image of a priest
They’re spoonfeeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they’ll kill him with self-confidence
After poisoning him with words
And the Phantom’s shouting to skinny girls
“Get Outa Here If You Don’t Know
Casanova is just being punished for going
To Desolation Row”

Now at midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart-attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row

Praise be to Nero’s Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
And everybody’s shouting
“Which Side Are You On?”
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
Fighting in the captain’s tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers
Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About Desolation Row

Yes, I received your letter yesterday
(About the time the doorknob broke)
When you asked how I was doing
Was that some kind of joke?
All these people that you mention
Yes, I know them, they’re quite lame
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name
Right now I can’t read too good
Don’t send me no more letters, no
Not unless you mail them
From Desolation Row
Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Ev’rybody knows
That Baby’s got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

Queen Mary, she’s my friend
Yes, I believe I’ll go see her again
Nobody has to guess
That Baby can’t be blessed
Till she sees finally that she’s like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl
It was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what’s worse
Is this pain in here
I can’t stay in here
Ain’t it clear that—

I just can’t fit
Yes, I believe it’s time for us to quit
When we meet again
Introduced as friends
Please don’t let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world
Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do
You make love just like a woman, yes, you do
Then you ache just like a woman
But you break just like a little girl
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I’m not sleepy and there is no place I’m going to
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you

Though I know that evenin’s empire has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me, I’m branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty street’s too dead for dreaming

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I’m not sleepy and there is no place I’m going to
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you

Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin’ ship
My senses have been stripped, my hands can’t feel to grip
My toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin’
I’m ready to go anywhere, I’m ready for to fade
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way
I promise to go under it
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I’m not sleepy and there is no place I’m going to
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you

Though you might hear laughin’, spinnin’, swingin’ madly across the sun
It’s not aimed at anyone, it’s just escapin’ on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facin’
And if you hear vague traces of skippin’ reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it’s just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn’t pay it any mind
It’s just a shadow you’re seein’ that he’s chasing

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I’m not sleepy and there is no place I’m going to
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you

Then take me disappearin’ through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I’m not sleepy and there is no place I’m going to
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you
I can’t understand
She let go of my hand
An’ left me here facing the wall
I’d sure like t’ know
Why she did go
But I can’t get close t’ her at all
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime
She said she would never forget
But now mornin’s clear
It’s like I ain’t here
She just acts like we never have met

It’s all new t’ me
Like some mystery
It could even be like a myth
Yet it’s hard t’ think on
That she’s the same one
That last night I was with
From darkness, dreams’re deserted
Am I still dreamin’ yet?
I wish she’d unlock
Her voice once an’ talk
’Stead of acting like we never have met
If she ain’t feelin’ well
Then why don’t she tell
’Stead of turnin’ her back t’ my face?
Without any doubt
She seems too far out
For me t’ return t’ her chase
Though the night ran swirling an’ whirling
I remember her whispering yet
But evidently she don’t
An’ evidently she won’t
She just acts like we never have met

If I didn’t have t’ guess
I’d gladly confess
T’ anything I might’ve tried
If I was with ’er too long
Or have done something wrong
I wish she’d tell me what it is, I’ll run an’ hide
Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played
Her mouth was watery and wet
But now something has changed
For she ain’t the same
She just acts like we never have met

I’m leavin’ today
I’ll be on my way
Of this I can’t say very much
But if you want me to
I can be just like you
An’ pretend that we never have touched
An’ if anybody asks me
“Is it easy to forget?”
I’ll say, “It’s easily done
You just pick anyone
An’ pretend that you never have met!”
When you’re lost in the rain in Juarez
And it’s Eastertime too
And your gravity fails
And negativity don’t pull you through
Don’t put on any airs
When you’re down on Rue Morgue Avenue
They got some hungry women there
And they really make a mess outta you

Now if you see Saint Annie
Please tell her thanks a lot
I cannot move
My fingers are all in a knot
I don’t have the strength
To get up and take another shot
And my best friend, my doctor
Won’t even say what it is I’ve got

Sweet Melinda
The peasants call her the goddess of gloom
She speaks good English
And she invites you up into her room
And you’re so kind
And careful not to go to her too soon
And she takes your voice
And leaves you howling at the moon
Up on Housing Project Hill
It’s either fortune or fame
You must pick up one or the other
Though neither of them are to be what they claim
If you’re lookin’ to get silly
You better go back to from where you came
Because the cops don’t need you
And man they expect the same

Now all the authorities
They just stand around and boast
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms
Into leaving his post
And picking up Angel who
Just arrived here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first
But left looking just like a ghost

I started out on burgundy
But soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they’d stand behind me
When the game got rough
But the joke was on me
There was nobody even there to call my bluff
I’m going back to New York City
I do believe I’ve had enough
Well, I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
Yes, I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
Well, you must tell me, baby
How your head feels under somethin’ like that
Under your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat

Well, you look so pretty in it
Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Yes, I just wanna see
If it’s really that expensive kind
You know it balances on your head
Just like a mattress balances
On a bottle of wine
Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat

Well, if you wanna see the sun rise
Honey, I know where
We’ll go out and see it sometime
We’ll both just sit there and stare
Me with my belt
Wrapped around my head
And you just sittin’ there
In your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you
It’s bad for your health, he said
Yes, I disobeyed his orders
I came to see you
But I found him there instead
You know, I don’t mind him cheatin’ on me
But I sure wish he’d take that off his head
Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat

Well, I see you got a new boyfriend
You know, I never seen him before
Well, I saw him
Makin’ love to you
You forgot to close the garage door
You might think he loves you for your money
But I know what he really loves you for
It’s your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
Down the street the dogs are barkin’
And the day is a-gettin’ dark
As the night comes in a-fallin’
The dogs’ll lose their bark
An’ the silent night will shatter
From the sounds inside my mind
For I’m one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind

From the crossroads of my doorstep
My eyes they start to fade
As I turn my head back to the room
Where my love and I have laid
An’ I gaze back to the street
The sidewalk and the sign
And I’m one too many mornings
An’ a thousand miles behind

It’s a restless hungry feeling
That don’t mean no one no good
When ev’rything I’m a-sayin’
You can say it just as good
You’re right from your side
I’m right from mine
We’re both just one too many mornings
An’ a thousand miles behind
You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
And you say, “Who is that man?”
You try so hard
But you don’t understand
Just what you’ll say
When you get home

Because something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You raise up your head
And you ask, “Is this where it is?”
And somebody points to you and says
“It’s his”
And you say, “What’s mine?”
And somebody else says, “Where what is?”
And you say, “Oh my God
Am I here all alone?”
Because something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You hand in your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
And says, “How does it feel
To be such a freak?”
And you say, “Impossible”
As he hands you a bone

Because something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
To get you facts
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
Anyway they already expect you
To just give a check
To tax-deductible charity organizations
You’ve been with the professors
And they’ve all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
You’ve been through all of
F. Scott Fitzgerald’s books
You’re very well read
It’s well known

Because something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says, “Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan”

Because something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
Now you see this one-eyed midget
Shouting the word “NOW”
And you say, “For what reason?”
And he says, “How?”
And you say, “What does this mean?”
And he screams back, “You’re a cow
Give me some milk
Or else go home”

Because something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Well, you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There ought to be a law
Against you comin’ around
You should be made
To wear earphones

Because something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Intro: Unidentified Audience Member & Bob Dylan]
Judas!
I don't believe you
You're a liar
Play it fucking loud

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn’t you?
People’d call, say, “Beware doll, you’re bound to fall”
You thought they were all kiddin’ you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin’ out
Now you don’t talk so loud
Now you don’t seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal

[Chorus]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 2]
You’ve gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
Nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
And now you find out you’re gonna have to get used to it
You said you’d never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He’s not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And ask him do you want to make a deal?

[Chorus]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone

[Verse 3]
You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
When they all come down and did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain’t no good
You shouldn’t let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain’t it hard when you discover that
He really wasn’t where it’s at
After he took from you everything he could steal

[Chorus]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone

[Verse 4]
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They’re all drinkin’ and thinkin’ that they got it made
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things
But you’d better lift your diamond ring, now you’d better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can’t refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You’re invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal

[Chorus]
How does it feel?
Oh, how does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone

[Outro]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Our love will never be another
You're just a devil undercover (Undercover)
Found you when you were in the gutter (In the gutter)
Shit was sweet until I was a sucker, shout out Jonas Brothers
I learned more than I cared to discover (Discover)
Don't you know that I'm more than a come up? (Come up)
You act up and then act like it's nothin' (Nothin')
Sold your soul, you stone cold, you a stunner (Stunner)

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you left (Left), shit was never right (Right)
In another bed (Bed) every single night (Night)
Had it to a science (Science), you were so precise ('Cise)
See it in your eyes (Eyes), saw you in the light (Light)
Somehow, mami, I still want you
Listen to me, don't drive away (Don't drive away)
Kill me softly, your hold on me is (Ooh)
Somethin' I can't explain

[Chorus]
I know you could never be my bitch (Yeah)
Shit could never be like this (Oh)
I know, stop thinkin' you're in my plans (Plans)
Hunnid times you blew another chance (Chance)
I know you were gettin' down on the low (Down the low)
Then runnin' back to me in the morning (In the morning)
I know shit could never be like this
You could never be my bitch
No, no
(Oh)

[Verse 2]
Our love will never be another (Uh)
You're just a devil undercover (Undercover)
Found you when you were in the gutter (In the gutter)
Shit was sweet until I was a sucker ('Til I was a sucker, yeah)
Rather be single for life (Single for life, rather be single)
Than be fuckin' with you
I ain't rollin' the dice, no (I ain't rollin' the dice)
I ain't playin' to lose (No)

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you left, shit was never right (No)
In another bed (Bed) every single night (Oh)
Had it to a science, you were so precise (Yeah)
See it in your eyes, saw you in the light (Light)
Somehow, mami, I still want you (Want you)
Listen to me, don't drive away (Don't drive away)
Kill me softly, your hold on me is (Ayy)
Somethin' I can't explain

[Chorus]
I know you could never be my bitch (Be my bitch)
Shit could never be like this (Be like this)
I know, stop thinkin' you're in my plans (Plans)
Hunnid times you blew another chance (Blew another chance)
I know you were gettin' down on the low (Down on the low)
Then runnin' back to me in the morning

Shit could never be like this
It could never be like this

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Hollywood's bleeding, vampires feedin'
Darkness turns to dust
Everyone's gone, but no one's leavin'
Nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feelin', but we'll never feel it
Ridin' on the last train home
Dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream
We only make it out alone

[Chorus]
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
We're scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're runnin' out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleedin', but we call it home

[Verse 2]
Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse to tell herself that she okay
It seem like dyin' young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle, blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go home

[Chorus]
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
We're scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're runnin' out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleedin', but we call it home

[Intro]
Yeah, oh, whoa, ooh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Said you needed a ride, but you wanted my car
Without that face, girl, you wouldn't get far
I really like you, despite who you are, oh (Who you are)
You see me on TV, you know I'm a star
You say you don't know me, but I know that's false
I'll pay the price, girl, whatever that cost, oh (What it cost)

[Pre-Chorus]
You make my life so hard
But that's what gets me off

[Chorus]
I had a thousand bad times
So what's another time to me? (What's that to me, yeah)
You try to burn my house down
But what's another house to me? (What's that to me, yeah)
'Cause I can take anything that you give me (What you give me)
It's gonna take a lot more to kill me, bitch
So thank you for the grave (Yeah)
I needed me a place to sleep (Place to sleep)

[Verse 2]
And I don't wanna meet your mama (No)
She prolly crazier than you (She prolly crazier than you)
I'm gonna need some thicker armor (Armor)
To spend another night with you (And on and on and on)
Baby, I know just what to do
Every time you fuck me over, I'll come back to you
Baby, I don't want to know the truth (Know the truth)
I ignore them when they tell me all the shit you do (Shit you do)
I always get my heart broke like I needed the practice (Needed)
Foot on my throat 'til my world is collapsin' (Damn)
But this what I chose, it's the law of attraction, yeah (Attraction)
(And on and on and on)

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you make my life so hard (So hard, so hard)
But that's what gets me off

[Chorus]
I had a thousand bad times
So what's another time to me? (So what's that to me, yeah)
You try to burn my house down
But what's another house to me? (So what's that to me, yeah)
'Cause I can take anything that you give me (What you give me)
It's gonna take a lot more to kill me, bitch (Kill me)
So thank you for the grave (Yeah)
I needed me a place to sleep (Place to sleep)

[Bridge]
I should get out, but I still want more
I should get out, what am I waitin' for?
It's all the same to me, it's all a game to me
It's all the same to me, it's all the same

[Chorus]
I had a thousand bad times
So what's another time to me? (What's that to me)
You try to burn my house down
But what's another house to me? (What's that to me)
'Cause I can take anything that you give me (What you give me)
It's gonna take a lot more to kill me, bitch (Kill me)
So thank you for the grave (Yeah)
I needed me a place to sleep (Place to sleep)
We go there, oh

[Intro: Future & Post Malone]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, you'd die for me
Said you'd die, said you'd die
But you lied, you lied to me

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
It was love at first sight, felt like you were chosen (Oh)
But that blood in your veins, yeah, I know it's frozen (It's so cold)
Got no patience no more (No), been waitin' too long (Yeah)
You hid that shit away and I was the last one to know, bitch (Ayy, ooh)
I heard you comin' in, I was lyin' there awake (Awake)
Didn't know that it was you, got the gun right out the safe (Damn)
Remember when you got my ass arrested (Wow)
At least when I was in jail, I got some rest in (Yeah)
Ooh, I surrender (Ayy), time to forget ya (Ayy)
I'm too tired to forgive ya (Ayy), it's too hard on my liver (Ayy)
And you know (Ayy) it’s all (Ayy) over now
All your friends (Ayy), you know (Ayy) they sold you out

[Chorus: Post Malone & Future]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me (Die for me)
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me (Lying to me)
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me (High with me)
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see (Side I see)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Die, die, die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me (Lie, lie, lie)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Die, die, die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me, yeah (You lied, yeah)

[Verse 2: Future]
It was a VIP, happened to be one of my best nights (Yeah)
9 AM, I came from out the club, it was daylight (Daylight)
Got a bad girl, I was treating her too nice (I was treating her too nice)
Caught you being vulnerable, that ain't what I need, ayy (That ain't what I need)
You just sold your soul, girl, quit crying (Sold your soul)
From your passport, it looks like you lying (Know you cold)
You broken down by your past, don't deny it (You know I know)
Your ex called, you was vulnerable, you flying, nah (Flying)
Wasn't on the best of terms, girl, I was trying (I was trying on ya)
I did everything to reach out to you (I was reaching out)
Said you never had me caught up in no drama (No drama)
I done ran into my karma (I done ran)

[Chorus: Future]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me (That you would die)
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me (You'd been lying)
We been on the low, but you been getting high with me (You was high)
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see (A different side)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Said you'd die, you said you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me (Know you're lying)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

[Verse 3: Halsey]
Settle down, I'll spell it out, it's simple enough
I came around, I figured out, should follow my gut
I don't play anymore, I went through your phone
And called the girls in your DMs and took all them home
And I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me
Grew into a savage and that's why they gave this verse to me
Turns out it shows 'cause they turn out at shows
I sold fifteen million copies of a break-up note
Brought some strangers in our beds
And now you lost your right to privacy
Spilling all our secrets
When you thought they'd probably die with me
Know you fucking love it on the low
And you don't have to say I'm crazy
'Cause I know nothing's changed though

[Chorus: Post Malone & Halsey, Halsey]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)

[Intro: Post Malone]
Mm, mm, mm
Mm

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain’t ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on ’em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Yeah, they bet I'ma fall
And I’m only 24, but, bitch, I been through it all
I got so many hits, can’t remember them all (Ooh)
While I'm takin’ a shit, look at the plaques on the wall
Y'all just sit back, get your kick back
Keep on actin' like you did that, got no respect
For nobody who's just fake in life, ayy, ayy
You ain’t really who you say you are
So pick up the pace, there ain't no slowin' me up (Slowin' me up)
Get the fuck out my face, can you stop blowing me up?
'Cause my time is expensive, one mill a setlist
Bought a new car 'fore you woke up for breakfast, yeah

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seen me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever (Too clever)
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yeah, where you been? (Where you been?)
When it was time to do some work and put it in (Put it in)
I just be laughin' when I see 'em, look at them (Ha)
Leave when I lose and pop back up as soon as I win (Uh)
You ain't my day one and I know you not my friend
So I can't judge you when you do some phony shit and just pretend
Like you really down with me, because bein' loyal starts within
I seen that money overpower that love and turn it thin
But it ain't stop me, I just kept goin' up, took it on the chin
I wish every time they said I would fold, I'd make an M
Fuck around and be as rich as Jeff Bezos, say it again
Never lose, I go overtime on 'em, stay in that gym
Let's get it

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I'm tired of bein' tired
This my last shot, you can't be mad, at least I tried
We supposed to be grown, but yet you still acting childish
I can get on the jet alone, I don't need no extra baggage
This year turned into a savage, I got baguettes in my necklace
Driving fast and I won't crash it and I'm supposed to be sober
But some kind of way, I just keep getting loaded
It's gonna take more than some pressure to fold me
Tried as hard as I can, but at this point it's outta my hands
I ain't runnin' out of these bands for nothin' or no one
She say I'm a dog, but it takes one to know one
Been goin' hard, been by myself, I don't need no love

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

[Outro: Post Malone]
Mm, oh, oh no
Mm, oh, oh no
On the road, oh

[Intro: Post Malone]
Oh

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
I never needed anything from you
And all I ever asked was for the truth (All I ever asked was for)
You showed your tongue and it was forked in two
Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you (Almost believed you)
Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake
Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown
Like a plague, I was wasting away
Tryna find my way out, find my way out (Find my way out)

[Pre-Chorus 1: Post Malone]
And it finally came the day
I start giving my heart away
For Heaven's sake, my bones will break
But you'll never own my soul, no

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
I took them stones you threw, made chains for the crew (Ice)
I brought up 10 hoes, this coupe only made for two (Yessir)
They all ran through it, it ain't nothin' left to do
I need some more reasons to live out this evening (Straight up)
I've been sippin' forever and just taking whatever
Hoping, thinking whenever you'll be back around
Let's go our ways, whichever
You say how is however long
'Cause you know I'll never be alone (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Travis Scott]
Love (Love, yeah)
Shorty gon' back (Shorty gon, shorty gon' back)
Need it on sight (Need it on, need it on sight)
Crack it all back (Crack it all, crack it all back)
Give her that pipe (Give her that, give her that pipe)
All of my gang (All of my, all of my gang)
Shawty went bad (Shawty went, shawty went bad)

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne & Post Malone]
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

[Outro: Post Malone]
Take it all away
Why don't you (Take what you want, take what you need)
Take what you need from me, yeah
(Take what you want) Why don't you (Take what you need)
(What you need, yeah)

You’re too close, to the flame
But you don’t, wanna turn around
Like you got me figured out

[Pre-Chorus 1: Post Malone]
But girl, what I can promise is I'll let you down
So don’t put up a fight
You’ll get lost in the light

[Chorus: Post Malone]
If you keep staring at the sun, you won’t see
What you have become, this can't be
Everything you thought it was
Blinded by the thought of us, so
Give me a chance, I will
Fuck up again, I warned
You in advance
But you just keep on starin' at the sun

[Verse 2: SZA]
Wait (Yeah, yeah, wait)
I know I got a lot of shit going on with me (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)

'Cause I can count on you to let me down
I won't put up a fight

Don't care about your puppy, just that ass and them breastses
Oh, girl, you a model? Damn, I never woulda guessed it
And if you tryna throw out all them vibes, I'ma catch 'em
The lifestyle we live is just too dangerous
Paranoid since they've been leakin' my shit
Wonder if it'll come out on the web
And I can't help all these bitches on my dick
Takin' a photo and postin' that shit
Comin' home late and I crawl into bed
She always be askin' me, "Where have you been?"
Whoa

Instalove
Well, if ignorance is bliss, then don't wake me up

'Cause I don't get on the internet no more

Double the cahh, double the bih'

I bet what's happening, y'all in the dih
I was up buh and all of the dick
Ain't big this big, my favorite shit
She grabbin' my dick, saying "is you shavin' this dick?
Crankin' it bit, then hangin' it bit, duh-buh-buh you hangin' in it?
Came in this bit' but it's say-bih-dih-bih

(Wish I could've been there myself)

[Verse 1]
Your second cousin lives in Orlando (Orlando)
And yeah, I just finished a show (Just finished a show)
People shoving shots down their damn throat
Some selling yes but I'm gonna say no (Gonna say no)

[Chorus]
It's what it is, it's how I live
All the places I've been (I’ve been)
I wish I could’ve been there myself
(Wish I could've been there myself)
I made so much, spent so much
And I can’t get enough (I can't get enough)
I wish I could've been there myself

[Verse 2]
All of this American dreamin'
Everybody’s sick of believin'
Oh, let's not give a fuck 'til
Giving a fuck has no meaning
Oh, I'm sick of believing
All of this American dreaming
Oh, let's not give a fuck 'til
Giving a fuck has no meaning, oh

[Chorus]
It's what it is, it's how I live
All the places I've been
I wish I could've been there myself
(Wish I could've been there myself)
I made so much, spent so much
And I can't get enough (No, I can't get enough)
I wish I could've been there myself
(Wish I could've been there myself)

[Outro]
No, I can't get enough
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Wasted on Sunday
Erase you on Monday
Allergic, allergic
Gave in by Friday
Went straight back to sideways
Allergic, allergic

[Pre-Chorus]
I took your pills and your drugs just to feel something else
'Cause I can't feel you no more

[Chorus]
So sad, but true
You're friends with all my demons
The only one that sees them
Too bad for you
So sad, but true
Gave a hundred million reasons
But why can't you believe them?
Too bad for you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, we fight and we fuck until we open the cuts
And now we're soberin' up but never sober enough
Allergic, allergic
Instead of holdin' me down, you're only holding me up
It shouldn't be so hard, this is impossible love
Allergic, allergic

[Pre-Chorus]
I took your pills and your drugs just to feel something else
'Cause I can't feel you no more

[Chorus]
So sad, but true
You're friends with all my demons
The only one that sees them
Too bad for you
So sad, but true
Gave a hundred million reasons
But why can't you believe them?
Too bad for you

[Outro]
So sad, but true
Gave a hundred million reasons
But why can't you believe them?
Too bad for you

[Intro]
Ooh, yeah, yeah, hey

Such a long time (Wow)
I've been waitin', I've been waitin' for a long time (Yeah)
Such a long time
I've been waitin', I've been waitin' for a long time (Yeah)

Ooh, this shit bliss, I'm so rich (Turnt as shit, ooh)
Abs like Abercrombie Fitch (Damn, ooh)
Mille, on my (Whoa, wrist, wrist)
Versace boxers on my dick (On my dick, damn)
Bud Light runnin' through my piss (Ooh)
On a yacht, 50 meters, it's offish (It's official)
50 carats on my fist (On my fist)
The roof go down when I hit switch (Ooh, bitch)
I money ball like Bradley Pitt (Bradley Pitt, ayy)
I worked so hard for all this shit (All this shit)
Pumpin' out classics (Ooh)
In the Batmobile, goin' bat shit

[Chorus]
Such a long time (Damn)
I've been waitin', I've been waitin' for a long time (Such a long time)
Such a long time (Such a long time)
I've been waitin', I've been waitin' for a long time (For a long time)
Such a long time

[Verse 2]
I'm in Saint-Tropez, I had to check wrist (Wow)
I just bought my girl a new necklace (A new necklace)
One, two, three, four, five, six (Five, six)
I'll take 'em all, don't matter what the price is (What the price is)
I said I'm sorry mama for my vices (For my vices)
You'll never understand what my life is (My life is)
One, two, three, four, five, six (Damn)
Shit, I'm checking off my bucket list (My bucket list)
You try to give advice, I don't need it
I've been doin' what I want since fetus
What you call a holiday (Ooh), I call another day (Yeah)
And I ain't ever stoppin', no apologies

[Chorus]
Such a long time (Such a long time)
I've been waitin', I've been waitin' for a long time (Such a long time)
Such a long time (Such a long time)
I've been waitin', I've been waitin' for a long time (A long time)
Such a long time

[Outro]
I'm in Saint-Tropez, I had to check wrist

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Used to have friends, now I got enemies (Ooh)
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me (Damn)
Used to have friends, now I got enemies (Ooh)
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
They said I would never get this far, ah, ah
Think that we don't see who you are, are, are?
Laughin' to the bank like ha, ha, ha
Guess that I'm just talkin' too much blah, blah, blah (Shut the fuck up)
So, where did y'all go? (Ooh)
When I was shit broke, couldn't even buy smokes
Now your mama needs tickets to my stadium show (Stadium show)
She love it when she hear me on the radio, oh
I know it's hard to swallow your pride
Sorry that you can't get over me (Over me)
Now you're out my life, I'm so relieved, I

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Used to have friends, now I got enemies (Damn)
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me (Ooh)
Money tend to show all they tendencies (Damn)
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]
Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
Close to my enemies (Let's go)
I need better energy (Huh?)
When I told you fuck you, you thought I was playin', huh?
(Yeah, yeah) But I meant the shit literally
She want to vibe but I told her fuck that (Nope)
She looking at me like she surprised
They're packin' the post and I'm home alone
When the box hit the door, they go for 35
I try to put on for my partners, they turn into enemies right before a nigga eye
You reach for a shake, I'ma hold out a fist
Giving a nigga a quarter pound without the fries
I just went double platinum with no features
Just to show a nigga I don't really need him
Pass a man a plate and he can make it shake
It's guaranteed he'll fold and bite the hand that feed him
And I know you think that I ain't see it
And I know you bitch ain't got a car
Don't make me go and buy a bitch a lil' Prius
Fuck on the camera, we can call it even
Friends are like the autumn, every year they leavin'
And I'ma rake 'em in a pile, throw 'em in a bag
Tie them bitches up and leave 'em
'Cause most of these niggas are deceiving
And I (Ooh)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Used to have friends, now I got enemies (Damn)
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me (Ooh)
Money tend to show all they tendencies (Damn)
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]
Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Bridge: Post Malone]
It's too late to turn this shit around (It's too late)
Only held me down when you wanted me to drown
It's too late to turn this shit around (It's too late)
So don't try and tell me that you're happy for me now

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me (Dead to me)
Money tend to show all they tendencies (Tendencies)
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]
Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Outro: Post Malone]
Ooh, it's too late
It's too late

[Chorus]
Hop off the boat (Row)
Swim in her throat (Row)
Rockin' the boat and I
Row it, row it, row it, row it (Row) row it
Yeah

[Verse 1]
If your DM clean, you should scroll one time
Playin' outside, I ain't grow up on vine
Don't blame me if I ain't grow up on time
Might oversleep but I show up on time
(Shh, stay low, roll one time)
Real casanova need 1 x 2
Hop out the bed, let the sun shine through
She talkin' vegan and wonton (Row)
I got a steak with the

Dunkin' the sauce like I'm Bron Bron (Row)
Cheer for me baby, need pompoms (Row)

[Chorus]
Hop off the boat (Row)
Swim in her throat (Row)
Rockin' the boat and I
Row it, row it, row it, row it, row, row it
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Drip overload, ain't a riverbank
Whippin' a boat on the interstate
Is it lit over there? Baby, which way?
Basically, I'm tryna litigate
Basically, I'm tryna lituate
That's where the flow is, bitch you say
I might just buy baby a figure eight
BBBW, still a eight
Let me motorboat, let me 

[?] your throat
She gon' hold the dope, I'm gon smoke the dope
Got the antidope, you can't overdose
I'm 'bout to run it a hundred O
And I'm a run it a hundred more
Foreign bitch, honey in her cheerio
She from some boat in Nigerio
She send me the money, Arsenio
Niggas be actin' so serio'

I'm 'bout to drop off a embryo
Row it, row it
Swagger is so heroic
Uh, Edgar Allen Poe it
Uh, flexin' on niggas, roids
She not tryna Speakerboxxx, she tryna Love Below It, low it
Forehead, for sure head
For no bread, she roll it (Row)

[Outro]
(Drop it low, roll one time)
Up in the dorm and it's cold here
Row it, row it, row it (Row)
(Drop it low, roll one time)

Row it, row it, row it (Row, row, row)
Row (Row, row, row, row, row, row)

[Intro]
Beautiful, I want you to know that I'm scared
That you’ll no longer want me
And all I request is you hurt me your best so I crumble
Often I need that to grow

[Verse 1]
Every foreign rendezvous I fear is the last
I'm aware the day may come, I’m left in the past
Angel, all I ask is that you make it hurt real bad
Say it so it stings deep, so I'll know you won’t come back
I’m preparing for me to

[Chorus]
Second guess my every action when I’ve lost it
Then I'd have to take the pictures of you off my desk
And I'll probably be to blame
Every promise that we made will be voided
Will be voided

[Verse 2]
Any trek across the sea, my thoughts are of you
All our time in Battersea, I’ll think of that too
Listen, you will have to take away all of my hope
Say it like you mean it and I’ll find a way to cope

[Bridge]
Talks up on your terrace nurture me
Talks about the odds of our encounter
Years before we had met I had dreamt of you
Now we’re face to face
Beautiful, I need you to know that I'm scared
That you’ll no longer stay

[Chorus]
Second guess my every action when I’ve lost it
Then I'd have to take the pictures of you off my desk
And I'll probably be to blame
Every promise that we made will be voided
Will be voided
The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
You've put me down upon my knees
Oh, I beg, I beg and plead, singing

Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head, and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing
You are
You are

Confusion never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks, gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know, singing

Come out upon my seas
Curse missed opportunities, am I
A part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease, singing
You are
You are
You are
You are
You are
You are
And nothing else compares
Oh, nothing else compares
And nothing else compares

You are
You are
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go (You are)
Home, home, where I wanted to go (You are)

[Verse]
Fuck them corny niggas, best believe we get it poppin'
I just gotta talk, I'm clumsy so I'll probably drop it
Go figure, gettin' money so they try to stop it
I pull out a knot that's thicker than your father's wallet
Always had to work, all my nigga from the projects
Ballin', no alert, nope, we don't do no gossip
Too much for my shit, bro, I don't do no moshpits
She with me, she gettin' flipped like a fuckin' socket
Doobie in my shirt, 'nother OZ in my pants
Ice on my hands, melt it, help you water plants
Yours never dance, eyes like I'm from Japan
In my Benz, gettin' fried like I come from France
Money too wide for a rubber band
Runnin' in, tryna cure the hate that they sufferin'
From underneath the sun, tryn' catch a tan
Tour all summer, now I'm home hittin' sex again
Gettin' fresh, hundred mil, nuttin' less
Give me brain, pass the test
Smell the strain, they impressed
Ma, rest, told me "Change my address"
Always aim for the neck, if you miss, hit the chest
I'm well known for showin' them shit they didn't know
But if you Snapchatting or Instagramming, you gotta go
There ain't no one else like me that's in the game
Lightening in my chain, I'm icy as hockey games
Need a real one that don't like me 'cause of the fame
Hold my team down like a fight before the bell ring
Ain't no refund when you cop, so what you payin'?
Ain't no details for the cops so what you sayin'?
You went from food to starvation 'cause y'all hatin'
See what I got? That's all patience and God's amazing
See what I came out of dawg? That should be motivation
Now all I think about's broad chasing and car racing
Money so long, my arm shaking, the foreign banking
I'm off the shore, flow so hot, I could spar with Satan
I open doors with my voice so 

[?] my face is
Rollie mixed race, got a big face
Gotta get cake, brought a big plate
Prada windbreak, thought I went late
Now that Benz skate, down the interstate
How'd I get great? Not a mistake

[Verse]
God must have sent you from Heaven, yeah
Your beauty's amazing, something that I've never seen in no one
Like Adam and Eve, we're the only ones here
You're that forbidden fruit but I'm trying to live
Forever and ever, yeah
Forever and ever, oh-whoa

[Chorus]
Girl, it seems all too easy (Easy)
If I told you I loved you, would you believe me? (Oh yeah)
You got the power, if you wanna change the seasons
Baby girl, I understand
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Baby, if you serve it, I'ma eat it
I've been dying just to taste it, girl, I need it (Oh-whoa)
I love you, girl, I really mean it
I just hope you understand (Oh, oh)

[Verse 1]
Never went to college
Leave your comments in the message box
He walks like Elvis Presley
'Cause his Bentley costs a million bucks

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She's hanging out the window and she's saying my name (Say my name)
Her head out of the window and she's saying my name
I have a talent for discretion
I make the good impression
As everybody's playing the game (What's that?)

[Chorus 1]
Hey there, did you call me? Are you lonely?
Should I pick you up?
Hey there, got some money? Do you love me?
Or you just trying me on?

[Verse 2]
There must be something in the water
I honestly can't be bothered
To spin around in circles like this
Well, these veteran social climbers
Their ambition and desires
A cocktail of charm and explicit pics

[Pre-Chorus 2]
She's out the window and she's saying my name (Say my name)
Her head out of the window and she's saying my name (Oh, hi Mark)
Oh my god, this is a tough one
She'll take my breath and then some
At least I'll leave this world with a final thrill (Hey)

[Chorus 2]
Hey there, did you call me? Are you lonely?
Should I pick you up?
Hey there, got some money? Do you love me?
Or you just trying me on?
I'm changing my position if you're thinking what I'm thinking
Yeah, it's not allowed
It's a funny situation when your man's out on vacation
Yeah, I'm ducking out

[Bridge]
Feel the love
Yeah, we'll take you where we can in the city of angels
Do you feel the love?
Yeah, we'll take you where we can, take you so many places
(All these beautiful faces)

[Chorus 3]
Hey there, did you call me? Well, should I pick you up?
Hey there, got some money? Do you love me?
Or you just trying me on?
(Oh, you love me now, ha ha)

[Chorus]
I got the love that you need, come and get it
I've been makin' time for you
If you got the love that I need, come and get it
I've been makin' time for you
I've been makin' time, ooh
I've been makin' time, ooh
I've been makin' time, ooh
I've been makin' time, ooh

[Drop]

[Refrain]
I got it bad, bae, I got it bad, bae
You got me hooked on your love, I need it badly
I got it bad, bae, I got it bad, bae
You got me hooked up on your love, alright

[Chorus]
I got the love that you need, come and get it
I've been makin' time for you
If you got the love that I need, come and get it
I've been makin' time for you
I've been makin' time, ooh
I've been makin' time, ooh
I've been makin' time, ooh
I've been makin' time, ooh

[Drop]

[Bridge]
Girl, you did what you did, now you can't undo it
You got me breaking the rules
I was fine, turned the love but now I'm goin' through it
I'm trippin', fallin' for you

[Refrain]
I got it bad, bae, I got it bad, bae
You got me hooked on your love, I need it badly
I got it bad, bae, I got it bad, bae
You got me hooked up on your love, alright

[Chorus]
I got the love that you need, come and get it
I've been makin' time for you
Oh baby, iIgot the love that you need, come and get it
I've been makin' time for you
Baby, I've been makin' time, ooh
I've been makin' time, ooh
I've been makin' time, ooh
I've been makin' time
I've been makin' time
I've been makin' time

[Drop]

[Verse 1]
Big talk, GOAT talk, player and that coach talk
You in the same spot from last year, nigga that's yo' fault
She asked what time I was born, 'cause she on costar
God played a role in my life, even the broke parts
You know, and I can't pick up on a payday
For people who ain't answer me back when it was mayday
I seen so many young kings end up like Tay-K
Boy I'm from that D, that Glock 9 more triggered than Nae Nae
Shit, I seen niggas who wasn't bitches get bitch smacked
I seen my daddy and my step momma get kidnapped
I'm paranoid, I'm always sittin' up, I can't sit back
Like I'm tryin' to get my six pack from 2006 back
Five Ps: Proper preparation prevents poor performance
Yeah nigga, I live that
Visualizer, made a song I do it then I did that
Where I was and where I wanted to be felt like a mismatch
Look, a hundred K out to the boys and girls
Another hundred to my family church
To sum it up in eleven words
I did more for my city than anyone ever livin', shit
Fuck if you like my verse
You sold your soul, I could never sell mine, nigga
Might hit the pussy but I still ain't hit my prime, nigga
Look, I'm mankind's one-of-a-kind
Even if I get ahead, I work like I'm runnin' behind
And I took some months off from the music
And still doubled my net worth, they asked, "How did you do it?"
Besides being one of the last investors in Uber
Plus my real estate deals, plus ember, plus wheels
If I stop now, all my businesses still movin'
Ten million on the crib so the clique can move in
And I'm in that bitch teachin' 'em about assets
And how to pay the least amount of taxes
And as long as the world is spinnin' on an axis, I need all access
And Xs, buddha and god bless us, nigga

[Verse 2]
I'm like Funk, what the fuck? Niggas really fuckin' up
I ain't in your conversation? Good, I don't want to talk
Tell my dog, "Grab the AUX, play my good music and walk"
Niggas skimmin' through my shit, see that shit really piss me off
See, let me know somethin', how the fuck I push Joe buttons
From him frontin' on me to like "Bro, you got somethin'"
I'm done treatin' everything like it's just not nothin'
Like I can't hit the LCA today and have the spot jumpin'
Goddamnit, I can walk in the middle of 

[?]
Wearing all green right now and stop traffic
My mother callin' me, my brother callin' me
My other brother callin' me, my stepsister and cousin callin' me
It's like the problems they can't handle, they give all to me
I never miss they calls, I miss my granny collard greens
Overwhelmed in my head, sometimes I want to scream
I wear my smile like a mask, happy Halloween
To see things 20/20, we needed 2019
It's crazy how the realest things make the silliest memes
Like Michael Jordan cryin' when he hit the hall of fame
That taught later on in life, I laugh at all my pain
Look, I know what it's like to have an endless hunger
And feel like your road to success is under construction
If you don't see me then you gotta be blind
My family all deltas, we been throwin' up dynasty signs
Dog, I'm Nigerian but I still got love for my Jamaicans, man
Fresh off of MTV 'cause I'm tryin' to make all the bands
Nigga
And Ms nigga
And Bs nigga
Haha
Spit this shit through the wire
I'm rockin' Cartier wires
Niggas snitchin' through the wire
My hood is worse than The Wire, nigga
My dogs say, "Let's get it," I'm like you preachin' to the choir
I could write memoirs on energy vampires
Who sit and transpire 'round industry campfires
And I be lookin' at 'em like, "You a damn liar, nigga"
Haha

[Verse 1]
Match me when I tell you things that no one knows about me
What keeps me up at night?
What keeps you in my life?
I left you at a time when you were trying to get your life back
I'll probably end up somewhere in the limelight
What keeps me up at night?
What keeps you in my life? (Oh)

[Verse 2]
I swear, if I could give you up, I would erase you
Get you out of my mind (He's all I think about)
Let you go somewhere else (Try to let go, but I can't help)
Alone in the clothes you let me borrow when the rain came
I'm laying down and I can't help but daydream
Who do you idolize now?
Do you ever think about me?

[Interlude]
Think about me
Think about me
Think about me

[Chorus]
I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me
I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me

[Bridge]
I think forever's too long
What does it mean to be loyal?
I put your jacket on
To make me feel important
I think forever's too long
What does it mean to be loyal?
I put your jacket on
To make me feel important
Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover

[Chorus]
I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me
I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me
I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me
I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me
I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me

[Outro]
I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me

[Verse 1]
Well, this is what it look like right before you fall
Stumblin' around, you've been guessin' your direction
Next step, you can't see at all
And I don't have a name, I don't have a name, no
Who am I to blame? Who am I to blame though?
And I cannot be changed, I cannot be changed, no
Trust me, I've tried
I just end up right at the start of the line
Drawin' circles
Mmm

[Verse 2]
Well, I drink my whiskey and you sip your wine
We're doing well, sittin', watchin' the world fallin' down, its decline
And I can keep you safe, I can keep you safe, mmm
Do not be afraid, do not be afraid
You're feelin' sorry, I'm feelin' fine
Don't you put any more stress on yourself, it's one day at a time
It's gettin' pretty late, gettin' pretty late
Damn, and I find
It goes around like the hands that keep countin' the time
Drawin' circles

[Verse 1]
Ring around the rosey
Pocket fulla OZ's
Watchin' for the police
AP or the Rollie?
Got a boyfriend, now she act like she don't know me
I ain't really trippin' 'cause the money is the mission
Lookin' in the mirror, I can see the competion
I'ma always keep it real, niggas fake and that's the difference
Stayin' outta prison
Got a couple pretty girls takin' turns kissing
Don't want her at my crib, told her "Stay up out my mentions"
You can see the money from a distance
Teach her how to roll kush and handle business
Blow it by the pound, you niggas still pinching
Makaveli bands and my diamonds end friendships
Ain't a million dollars? I can't show interest
When I'm round you niggas, I can feel the tension
The shit I'm smokin' strong enough to start a engine

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm a gangster, I can't tell you twice (I can't tell you twice)
If you believe me, girl, that would be nice (Girl, that would be nice)
I could fuck you but I can't stay the night (But I can't stay the night)
I'm on a roll, when I'm on a roll
When I gotta go then I gotta go

[Verse 2]
Mayweather diamonds on
Say she never tried a bong
And she love all my songs
Crazy, said "I got her goin'"
Rappin', handle business like I'm Jay-Z but my name ain't Shawn
I got hella talent, I ain't gotta flaunt
Smokin' wit' a bitch that's bad and blonde, tell her "Tag along"
So many diamonds in it, can't tell if the time is wrong
They tell you "Young Khalifa the GOAT", you been well informed
No, I never took the easy road, I weathered the storm
Few rings, six chains and a hoodie on
Khalifa man, gettin' money, they know what he on
Hating on another nigga, somethin' I ain't never doing
Instead of holding on to game shit, I'd rather show 'em
How to hustle, how to grow
How to stack that money up and get mo'
How to be in the public but stay low, it takes patience, move slow
And don't forget what you do it for

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm a gangster, I can't tell you twice (I can't tell you twice)
If you believe me, girl, that would be nice (Girl, that would be nice)
I could fuck you but I can't stay the night (But I can't stay the night)
I'm on a roll, when I'm on a roll
When I gotta go then I gotta go

[Outro]
Girl, I'm a gangster, I can't tell you twice (I can't tell you twice)
If you believe me, girl, that would be nice (Girl, that would be nice)
I could fuck you but I can't stay the night (But I can't stay the night)
I'm on a roll, when I'm on a roll (On a roll)
When I gotta go, girl, I gotta go (Gotta go)

[Intro: Drake]
(Sonorous on the beat)
And I know

[Chorus: Drake]
My life is full of drama
I just want the top, don't wanna charm her
Talk about the boy and you get karma
Bad karma, that's a sad story, yeah, real bad karma

[Verse 1: Drake]
Condo in Miami, sold that shit to Chalmers
I stay on the beach when I retire
I can't miss a game, I been on fire
I'm thinkin' money when I sleep now
That's the only thing that get me geeked now
Someone got a problem every week now
Oh, now, they talkin' beefs, now
Gotta make peace and stay a hunnid (Stay a hunnid)
All my girls bad, times a hunnid (Times a hunnid)
And I'm going hard, times a hunnid (Times a hunnid)
I'm tryna see a hunnid, times a hunnid
For the guys, for the city and the gang
I might appear if you keep calling on my name
Put a curse up on you, things are getting strange
You ain't lie when you told me that I changed
And I know

[Chorus: Drake]
(Sonorous on the beat)
My life is full of drama
I just want the top, don't wanna charm her
Talk about the boy and you get karma
Bad karma, that's a sad story, yeah, real bad karma

[Verse 2: Bryson Tiller]
Aye, 2 A.M. with my departure
Jug out to Miami, flew in charter
Stay one hunnid, look at me I've been in charge (Charge)
Oh, you know I'm 'bout to sauce on you (Sauce)
Suggest you lighten up, I might go dark on you (Sauce)
Hey, pull up, pull up, skrt, vallet park on you
Ayy, King Kong, climbing up the charts on you
Oh, goddamn, say my life is full of drama
Hot boy, I feel like Dwayne Michael Carter
(Sononous on the beat)
Life been good since I became a father
Thought you said a kid would make it harder
No-no-no, trust me it just made me smarter
I cut some niggas off, put some real ones on the roster
Never mix the real niggas with the impostors
Keep them niggas far from us, I say, "Fuck 'em all" (I)
I say, "Fuck 'em all"
I just checked all my accounts and my money sittin' tall
Nigga, shut your fuckin' mouth, ain't no need to air you out
Niggas know what you about, heard you goin' through a drought
Must be why you talkin' down
Boy I know

[Chorus: Drake with Bryson Tiller]
My life is full of drama
I just want the top, don't wanna charm her
Talk about the boy and you get karma
Bad karma, that's a sad story

[Outro]
(Sonorous on the beat)

[Intro]
Apart of you
A masterpiece of art, it's true
I want total control
I know it's hard to do
I'm not foolish, no

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse]
Relax
Lay it back
That's that
Relax
Relax (Relax, relax, relax, relax, relax, relax)
Lay it back (Lay it back, lay it back, lay it back, lay it back, lay it back, lay it back)
That's that (That's that, that's that, that's that, that's that, that's that, that's that)
Relax (Relax, relax, relax, relax, relax, relax)

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse]
Lately I feel like I've been losing my mind
I'm acting funny, I keep refilling my wine
I failed to notice when I blew past my limit
And then I lied about it, said I didn't
I'm writing words that didn't come to my head
I'm pushing pennies in my paperback instead
When someone calls me I'm most likely to ignore, 'cause
Recall that limit that I missed before

[Chorus]
She's moving faster now
Faster than sound itself
Yeah, she's got me slipping when I told her what was on my mind
That she's mysterious

[Verse 2]
I caught a current and I'm floating away
I feel it right behind my mama and my brain
Is that my tears or is it right behind my eyes?
Sooner or later, will I realize?
Fake aggravation is your way to be seen
You summon every single muscle on the team
You need attention, well baby there's a line
Signed sealed delivered, that's my overtime

[Chorus]
She's moving faster now
Faster than sound itself
Yeah, she's got me slipping when I told her what is on my mind
That she's mysterious (Mysterious than all the lies)
She's moving faster now (She's moving faster now)
Faster than sound itself (Faster than sound itself)
Well, she's got me slipping when I don't know what is on my mind
That she's mysterious (Mysterious than all the lies)

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
(Do you care?)
(Do you care?)
(Do you care?)
(Do you care?)
Not at all (Do you care?)
Not at all
Not at all (Do you care?)
Not at all
Not at all (Do you care?)
Not at all
Not at all (Do you care?)
Not at all
Not at all (Do you care?)
You know I really don't care (Not at all)
I got the feeling right here (Not at all) (Do you care?)
You know I really don't care (Not at all, not at all) (Do you care?)
You know I really don't care (Not at all)
I got the feelings right here (Not at all) (Do you care?)
The safe way we appear (Not at all)
Oh baby that's all right (Not at all) (Do you care?)
You know I really don't care (Not at all)
I got the feelings right here (Not at all) (Do—)

[Verse 1]
Let me down
This is freaking me out
All of this attention turns the glamorous on it's side
Oh yeah, alright
This Tentpole Shangri-La displays this paradise in new light
So mark my words 'cause they gonna be true
If you done change your insides, they'll take enemies over you
Oh yeah, alright
This tentpole Shangri-La has got its sights between your eyes

[Bridge]
Why can't you just come on let me know

[Verse 2]
Brother Joe, does it ring any bells?
One of many faces that you stranded on the shelf
Oh no, alright
This tentpole Shangri-La has turned me into something trite
Conflicts and complications that you made up all the time
Have all proven to be worthless, fabricated in your mind
Oh no, I thought that's all right
So I turn to face my baby girl
She said she's never met me in her life

[Intro]
Parliaments
Get my friends
From the end
Keep us together
Lifeline low
Come and go
Is she still stoned or
Under the weather?

[Chorus]
Life is a line on the road
(It's stranger than I thought)
My anonymity is gone
(Is that just what you want?)
Bye to the private times they’re
All down there
(it seems so long)
Au contraire
(I hope I'm wrong)
They're up there
(And that’s enough)
Just to feel undone

[Verse]
Mama's boy
Can't enjoy
All these spoils
He's way too busy
So rest your head
And go to bed
But they won't let him
It's not that easy

[Chorus]
And life is a line on the road
(It's stranger than I thought)
And my anonymity is gone
(Is that just what you want?)
Bye to the private times they're
All down there
(it seems so long)
Au contraire
(I hope I’m wrong)
They’re up there
(And that's enough)
Just to feel undone

[Intro]
Finished on the telephone
Didn't think I'd last this long
Worried my future's untold
Coming up, it's coming on
It's coming on

[Verse 1]
Pretty pictures in my mind
Close the old Venetian blinds
If they come around again
Don't let Paulie let them in
Never let 'em in
(Yeah)

[Bridge]
Nothing is forever, it's a matter of time
Problems seem to multiply
Naturally, it's better when there's no reason why
The reasons stand, the questions liquefy

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Finally we're back on track
Trace your finger down her back
If you're down and can't come up
Fill her old forgotten cup

[Bridge]
So slowly
Are you feeling lonely
Slowly shrink away

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
Stop

[Intro]
I met somebody in a different way
I used to think it was wrong
Try licking letters in a virtual way
It's hard to
I don't have a clue
Who is that brand new baby girl?

[Verse]
We come together down in Tokyo
And walked the streets for a while
We stick together so we're not on our own
It's brand new
Harmless through and through
Wings up, bye-bye brand new baby girl

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
I make my way on back from Carroll Street
I'm walking all on my own
Deep down inside I know I need a little company
Next week, we'll just wait and see
Berean or brand new baby girl (Baby girl, baby girl)
(Ba-ba-ba-baby girl, baby girl)
(Ba-ba-ba-baby girl, baby girl)
(Ba-ba-ba-baby girl, baby girl)
(Ba-ba-ba-baby girl, baby girl)
(Ba-ba-ba-baby girl, baby girl)
(Ba-ba-ba-baby girl)

[Chorus]
You're on your own
Flash Mountain is getting you up, that's right
You're on your own
Flash Mountain is getting you up, that's right
You're on your own
Flash Mountain is getting you up, that's right
You're on your own
Flash Mountain is getting you up, that's right
Tonight, alright
I said Flash Mountain is getting you up, that's right
Tonight, alright
I said Flash Mountain is getting you up, that's right

[Verse 1]
I don't want it
I don't need it
Better off without it
I won't use it
I'll abuse it
That's right, baby, get on up
Let's rock

[Bridge]
Rock

[Verse 2]
Information on the road
Everything you know
Bending backwards throughout time
The history of mankind

[Chorus]
You're on your own
Flash Mountain is getting you up, that's right
You're on your own
Flash Mountain is getting you up, that's right
You're on your own
Flash Mountain is getting you up, that's right
You're on your own
Flash Mountain is getting you up, that's right
Tonight, alright
I said Flash Mountain is getting you up, that's right
Tonight, alright
I said Flash Mountain is getting you up, that's right

[Intro]
Mentally unprepared for the future that I'm livin’ in
Cover to cover, the mark of a lover
Is patience through time
Will you be mine?
I am only half a man without you

[Verse]
Absolutely certain that these feelings that we’re going through
Must have a meaning
The way that we’re leaning doesn’t look good
Maybe it could
Whisper to me, “Everything’s gonna be alright”

[Bridge]
Moving away, moving away
Moving away, moving away

[Verse 2]
Now I know this
Yesterday’s done with
How can I know what the future holds
Each second is a piece of gold
And I want you
Baby, I need you
Seems untrue, but I know I do
Each day is gonna be so blue
If we don’t get to see this through
I won’t be sorry
(I won’t be sorry)
(I won’t be sorry)
(I won’t be sorry)

[Outro]
Hey, they're ready for ya!
I'm coming, I'm coming
God bless me

[Verse 1]
You've been waiting for your lover
When you'll discover
She's always there
Walk a while in her summer
She is the drummer
Of your beating heart
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Won't you tell her that you love her?
And you'll hug her
Most every day
Don't you try to push or shove her
Find another
Or she'll walk away

[Refrain 1]
She'll walk away
She'll walk away

[Chorus]
She's a woman in a dream
One that makes you fall in love
Though her face is never seen
She is what this love is of

[Verse 3]
Stay a while in your slumber
Tumble under
And never wake
Dream forever in your wonder
She'll never sunder
Into the day

[Refrain 2]
Into the day
Into the day

[Chorus]
She's a woman in a dream
One that makes you fall in love
Though her face is never seen
She is what this love is of
She's a woman in a dream
One that makes you feel in love
Though her face is never seen, yeah
She is what this love is of

[Outro]
Like a woman in a dream
One that makes you fall in love
Though her face is never seen
She is what our love is made of

[Intro]
Yeah
Yes, yes, y'all and you don't stop
Mhm
To the beat ya'll and you don't stop
Yes yes, y'all and you don't stop
Unh
1, 2, ya'll and you don't stop
Yes yes ya'll and you don't stop
Uhhh
And to the beat Com sense'll be the sure shot
Come on
Unh

[Verse 1]
I used to rock braids with the hat to the back
Used to hit the road, take trips for the pack
Used to sag my pants, act hard when I rapped
'Cause pixburgh niggas don't take no slack
Used to have to sell weed for lunch everyday
Used to duck shots at the park just to play
Used to have to make sure my mom knew I was safe
Used to tell lies to my pops, sad to say
Now I'm 32 and I see things different
'S'all about love, it ain't all about the image
Say they down for you, when it's hot they dippin'
Police come around, put that out, they trippin'
Ridin' 'round the city, fo' deep, roof missin'
Hardest in the city, we the ones they mention
Gotta get this money cause I gotta pay rent
And if it don't make dollars then it don't make sense then
Wanna get paid then you gotta have vision
Ridin' with a bad yellow bitch, no simpson

[Hook]
So, so, so gangster
So, so, so gangster
So, so, so gangster
So, so, so gangster

[Verse 2]
A young stoners dream
Stash cheese, peas while I sip McQueen
My niggas the real thing, no player I own the team
And if you in my car, you smokin' trees
If you gang, then you gang, ain't no in between
Keep it G, ain't no time for no sympathy
Seen it all so I value the simple things
I'on flex, couple chains, couple simple rings
Go to dinner, we don't order what the menu brings
That's some boss shit you seen in a movie
Everywhere I go I'm seen with a doobie
Niggas cool but they really don't move me
Snatch girls, you might think I'm a bully
Imma need me a two piece
No lie, that's truthfully
When it's all said and done, it's either you or me
Learned how to ball, no hoopin' league
Top down, no roof for me
You hear the crowd, how they root for me
Here's a pound, roll a few for me
I kick 'em out, I'm exclusive please
This is my house, Imma need you to leave
They don't know the difference
From a nigga keepin' it real and straight trippin'
I hop in my whip on them thangs, I'm straight dippin'
You want me to put you on game, just pay attention
I'm never slippin'

[Hook]
So, so, so gangster
So, so, so gangster
So, so, so gangster
So, so, so gangster

[Verse 1]
Well, the sweet pretty things, they're in bed now, of course
City fathers they’re trying to endorse
Reincarnation of Paul Revere’s horse
But the town has no need to be nervous

[Verse 2]
Ghost of Belle Starr she hands down her wits
Jezebel the nun she violently knits
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits
At the head of the chamber of commerce

[Chorus]
Mama’s in the fact’ry she ain’t got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley
He’s lookin’ for the fuse
I’m in the kitchen with the
Tombstone blues

[Verse 3]
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade
Screaming she moans, “I’ve just been made”
Sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
Says, “My advice is to not let the boys in”

[Verse 4]
Now the medicine man comes
He shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
“Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride
You will not die, it’s not poison”

[Chorus]
Mama’s in the fact’ry
Ain’t got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley
Lookin’ for the fuse
I’m in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues

[Verse 5]
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks home and the college

[Verse 6]
I wish I could write you a melody so plain

[?] lady, I'm going insane
Doctors weeping, it's useless pain
Like useless and pointless knowledge

[Chorus]
Mama’s in the fact’ry
Ain’t got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley
Lookin’ for the fuse
I’m in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues

[Verse 1]
I seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of you
You were trying to break into another world
A world I never knew
I always kinda wondered
If you ever made it through
I seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of you

[Verse 2]
I seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of me
If I was still the same
If I ever became what you wanted me to be
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line
That only you could see?
I seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of me

[Bridge]
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
As the last fire truck from hell
Goes rolling by
All good people are praying
It’s the last temptation, the last account
The last time you might hear the sermon on the mount
The last radio is playing

[Verse 3]
I seen a shooting star tonight
Slip away
Tomorrow gonna be
Another day
Guess it’s too late to say the things to you
But you needed to hear me say
I seen a shooting star tonight
Slip away

[Verse 1]
“There must be some way out of here,” said the joker to the thief
“There’s too much confusion, I can’t get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth”

[Verse 2]
“No reason to get excited,” the thief, he kindly spoke
“There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we’ve been through that, and this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour is getting late”

[Verse 3]
All along the watchtower, princes kept the view
All the women came and went, barefoot servants, too
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl

[Verse 1]
Come gather ’round people wherever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you’ll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth savin’
Then you better start swimmin’ or you’ll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin’

[Verse 2]
Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide, the chance won’t come again
Don’t speak too soon for the wheel’s still in spin
And there’s no tellin’ who that it’s namin’
For the loser now will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin’

[Verse 3]
Come senators, congressmen
Please heed the call
Don’t lock up  the doorway
Don’t block up the hall
He that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
There’s a battle outside and it is ragin’
It’ll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin’

[Verse 4]
Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
Don’t criticize what you can’t understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly agin’
Please get out of the new one if you can’t lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin’

[Verse 5]
The line it is drawn and the curse it is cast
The slow one now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past
The order is rapidly fadin’
And the first one now will later be last
For the times they are a-changin’

[Verse 1]
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore
His mama sure was proud of him
He stood straight and tall in his uniform and all
His mama’s face broke out all in a grin

[Verse 2]
“Oh son, you look so fine, I’m glad you’re a son of mine
Make me proud to know you hold a gun
Do what the captain says, lots of medals you will get
We’ll put them on the wall when you come home”

[Verse 3]
That old train pulled out, John’s ma began to shout
Tellin’ ev’ryone in the neighborhood:
“That’s my son that’s about to go, he’s a soldier now, you know”
She made well sure her neighbors understood

[Verse 4]
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile
She showed them to the people from next door
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
And these things she called a good old-fashioned war

[Verse 5]
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come
They ceased to come for about ten months or more
When a letter finally came saying, “Go down and meet the train
Your son’s a-coming home from the war”

[Verse 6]
She smiled and went right down, she looked everywhere around
But she could not see her soldier son in sight
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last
When she did she could hardly believe her eyes

[Verse 6]
Oh his face was all shot off and his hand was all blown away
And he wore a metal brace around his waist
He whispered kind of slow, in a voice she didn't know
While she couldn’t even recognize his face

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 7]
“Oh tell me, my darling son, tell me what they done
How is it you come to be this way?”
He tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly move
And his mother had to turn her face away

[Verse 8]
“Don’t you remember, Ma, when I went off to war
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud
You wasn’t there standing in my shoes”

[Verse 9]
“Oh, and I thought when I was there, God, what am I doing here?
I’m tryin’ to kill somebody or die tryin’
But the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came close
And I saw that his face looked just like mine”

[Verse 10]
“And I couldn’t help but think, through the thunder rolling and stink
That I was just a puppet in a play
And through the roar and smoke, this string it finally broke
And a cannonball blew my eyes away”

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 11]
As he turned away to go, his Ma was acting slow
At seein’ the metal brace that helped him stand
But as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
And he dropped his medals down into her hand
Well, they’ll stone ya when you’re trying to be so good
They’ll stone ya just a-like they said they would
They’ll stone ya when you’re tryin’ to go home
Then they’ll stone ya when you’re there all alone
But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

Well, they’ll stone ya when you’re walkin’ ’long the street
They’ll stone ya when you’re tryin’ to keep your seat
They’ll stone ya when you’re walkin’ on the floor
They’ll stone ya when you’re walkin’ to the door
But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

They’ll stone ya when you’re at the breakfast table
They’ll stone ya when you are young and able
They’ll stone ya when you’re tryin’ to make a buck
They’ll stone ya and then they’ll say, “good luck”
Tell ya what, I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned
Well, they’ll stone you and say that it’s the end
Then they’ll stone you and then they’ll come back again
They’ll stone you when you’re riding in your car
They’ll stone you when you’re playing your guitar
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

Well, they’ll stone you when you walk all alone
They’ll stone you when you are walking home
They’ll stone you and then say you are brave
They’ll stone you when you are set down in your grave
But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

[Verse 1]
They’re selling postcards of the hanging
They’re painting the passports brown
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Here comes the blind commissioner
They’ve got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
The other is in his pants
And the riot squad they’re restless
They need somewhere to go
As Lady and I look out tonight
From Desolation Row

[Verse 2]
Cinderella, she seems so easy
“It takes one to know one,” she smiles
Puts her hands in her back pockets
Bette Davis style
In comes Romeo, he’s moaning
“You Belong to Me I Believe”
Someone turns and says, “You’re in the wrong room, my friend
You better leave”
And the only sound that’s left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row

[Verse 3]
Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
The fortune-telling lady
Has even taken all her things inside
All except for Cain and Abel
And the Hunchback of Notre Dame
Everyone is either making love
Or else expecting rain
And the Good Samaritan, he’s dressing
He’s getting ready for the show
He’s going to the carnival tonight
On Desolation Row

[Verse 4]
Now Ophelia, she’s ’neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday
She already is an old maid
To her, death is quite romantic
She wears an iron vest
Her profession’s her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness
And though her eyes are fixed upon
Noah’s great rainbow
She spends her time peeking
Into Desolation Row

[Verse 5]
Across the street they’ve nailed the curtains
They’re getting ready for the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
A perfect image of a priest
They’re spoonfeeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they’ll kill him with self-confidence
After poisoning him with words
And the Phantom’s shouting to skinny girls
“Get outta here if you don’t know
Casanova is just being punished for going
To Desolation Row”

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 6]
Now at midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart-attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping
Desolation Row

[Verse 7]
Yes, I received your letter yesterday
About the time the doorknob broke
When you asked how I was doing
Was that some kind of joke?
All these people that you mention
Yes, I know them, they’re quite lame
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name
Right now I can’t read too good
Don’t send me no more letters, no
Not unless you mail them
From Desolation Row

[Verse 1]
Fat man lookin’ in a blade of steel
Thin man lookin’ at his last meal
Hollow man lookin’ in a cottonfield
For dignity

[Verse 2]
Wise man lookin’ in a blade of grass
Young man lookin’ in the shadows that pass
Poor man lookin’ through painted glass
For dignity

[Verse 3]
Somebody got murdered on New Year’s Eve
Somebody said that dignity was the first to leave
I went into the city, into the town
Into the land of the midnight sun

[Verse 4]
Searchin’ high, searchin’ low
Searchin’ everywhere I know
Askin’ the cops wherever I go
"Have you seen dignity?"

[Verse 5]
Blind man breakin’ out of a trance
Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance
Hopin’ to find one circumstance
Of dignity

[Verse 6]
I went to the wedding of Mary Lou
She said, “I don’t want nobody see me talkin’ to you”
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew
About dignity

[Verse 7]
I went down where the vultures feed
I would’ve gone deeper, but there wasn’t any need
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Wasn’t any difference to me

[Verse 8]
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade
House on fire, debts unpaid
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid
"Have you seen dignity?"

[Verse 9]
Drinkin’ man listens to the voice he hears
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors
Lookin’ into the lost forgotten years
For dignity

[Verse 10]
I met Prince Phillip in the home of the blues
Said he’d give me information if his name wasn’t used
He wanted money up front, he said he'd abused
By dignity

[Verse 11]
Footprints runnin’ ’cross the silver sand
Steps goin’ down into tattoo land
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
In the bordertowns of despair

[Verse 12]
Got no place to fade, got no coat
I’m on the rollin’ river in a jerkin’ boat
Tryin’ to read a letter to me somebody wrote
About dignity

[Verse 13]
Sick man lookin’ for the doctor’s cure
Lookin’ at his hands for the lines that were
And into every masterpiece of literature
For dignity

[Verse 14]
Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
Combin’ his hair back, his future looks thin
He bites the bullet and he looks within
For dignity

[Verse 15]
Someone showed me a picture, I just had laughed
Dignity never been photographed
I went into the red, I went into the black
Wwent into the valley of dry bone dreams

[Verse 16]
So many roads, so much at stake
So many dead ends, I’m at the edge of the lake
Sometimes I wonder what it’s gonna take
To find dignity

[Verse 1]
Mama, take this badge off of me
I can’t use it anymore
It’s gettin’ dark, too dark to see
And I feel like I’m knockin’ on heaven’s door

[Chorus]
Knocking on, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door
Just like so many time's before

[Verse 2]
Mama, wipe the blood out of my face
I just can't see through it any more
That long red feeling and it's hard to trace
And I feel like I’m knockin’ on heaven’s door

[Chorus]
Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door
Just like so many time's before

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 3]
Mama, lay my guns into the ground
I just can’t fire them anymore
That long black train is a-comin’ down
I feel like I’m knockin’ on heaven’s door

[Chorus]
Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door
Just like so many time's before

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn’t you?
People’d call, say, “Beware doll, you’re bound to fall”
You thought they were all kiddin’ you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin’ out
Now you don’t talk so loud
Now you don’t seem so proud
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal

[Chorus]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone

[Verse 2]
You’ve gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
Nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
And now you find out you’re gonna have to get used to it
You said you’d never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He’s not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say "Do you want to make a deal?"

[Chorus]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone

[Verse 3]
You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
When they all come down and did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain’t no good
You should never let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain’t it hard when you discover that
He really wasn’t where it’s at
After he's taken from you everything he could steal?

[Chorus]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
Drinkin’, thinkin’ that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts and thing
But take your diamond ring, you’d better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags kinda like the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can’t refuse
When you ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You’re invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal

[Chorus]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone

[Verse 1]
Oh, my name it is nothin’
My age it means less
The country I come from
Is called the Midwest
I was born and brought up there
The laws to abide
And that the land that I live in
Has God on its side

[Verse 2]
Now the history books tell it
They tell it so well
The cavalries charged
And the Indians fell
The cavalries charged
And the Indians died
Oh, the country was young
With God on its side

[Verse 3]
Now the Spanish-American
War had its day
And the Civil War too
Was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes
I was made to memorize
With guns in their hands
And God on their side

[Verse 4]
The First World War, boys
It came and it went
The reason for fighting
I never did get
But I learned to accept it
Accept it with pride
For you don’t count the dead when
God’s on your side

[Verse 5]
But now we got weapons
Of the chemical dust
If fire them we're forced to
Then fire them we must
One push of the button
And a shot the world wide
And you never ask questions
When God's on your side

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 6]
Through many dark hour
I’ve been thinkin’ about this
That Jesus Christ
Was betrayed by a kiss
But I can’t think for you
You’ll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot had
God on his side

[Verse 7]
So now as I’m leavin’
I’m weary as Hell
The confusion I’m feelin’
Ain’t no tongue can tell
The words fill my head and
They fall to the floor
And if God’s on our side
He’ll stop the next war

[Intro]
Da, da da da, da da da da

[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight (Mad tight, mad tight)
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

[Bridge]
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

[Outro]
I'm a bad guy
I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy

[Chorus]
I will take you to the beach where it's sandy
To the things that we can't say
You a freak do me nasty
Super clean

I will take you to the beach where it's sandy
Take you to the beach where it's sandy
At the beach where its sandy
At the beach where its sandy
I will take you to the beach where it's sandy
Fucking in the sheets
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To get along with you
Honey, just allow me one more chance
Ah'll do anything with you
Well, I’m a-walkin' down the road
With my head in my hand
I'm lookin’ for a woman
Needs a worried man
Just-a one kind favor I ask you
'Low me just-a one more chance

Honey, just allow me one more chance
To ride your aeroplane
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To ride your passenger train
Well, I've been lookin' all over
For a gal like you
I can't find nobody
So you'll have to do
Just-a one kind favor I ask you
'Low me just-a one more chance
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To get along with you
Honey, just allow me one more chance
Ah'll do anything with you
Well, lookin’ for a woman
That ain’t got no man
Is just lookin' for a needle
That is lost in the sand
Just-a one kind favor I ask you
’Low me just-a one more chance
Well, I was feelin’ sad and feelin’ blue
I didn’t know what in the world I wus gonna do
Them Communists they wus comin’ around
They wus in the air
They wus on the ground
They wouldn’t gimme no peace . . 

So I run down most hurriedly
And joined up with the John Birch Society
I got me a secret membership card
And started off a-walkin’ down the road
Yee-hoo, I’m a real John Bircher now!
Look out you Commies!

Now we all agree with Hitler’s views
Although he killed six million Jews
It don’t matter too much that he was a Fascist
At least you can’t say he was a Communist!
That’s to say like if you got a cold you take a shot of malaria

Well, I wus lookin’ everywhere for them gol-darned Reds
I got up in the mornin’ ’n’ looked under my bed
Looked in the sink, behind the door
Looked in the glove compartment of my car
Couldn’t find ’em . . 
I wus lookin’ high an’ low for them Reds everywhere
I wus lookin’ in the sink an’ underneath the chair
I looked way up my chimney hole
I even looked deep down inside my toilet bowl
They got away . . 

Well, I wus sittin’ home alone an’ started to sweat
Figured they wus in my T.V. set
Peeked behind the picture frame
Got a shock from my feet, hittin’ right up in the brain
Them Reds caused it!
I know they did . . . them hard-core ones

Well, I quit my job so I could work all alone
Then I changed my name to Sherlock Holmes
Followed some clues from my detective bag
And discovered they wus red stripes on the American flag!
That ol’ Betsy Ross . . 

Well, I investigated all the books in the library
Ninety percent of ’em gotta be burned away
I investigated all the people that I knowed
Ninety-eight percent of them gotta go
The other two percent are fellow Birchers . . . just like me

Now Eisenhower, he’s a Russian spy
Lincoln, Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy
To my knowledge there’s just one man
That’s really a true American: George Lincoln Rockwell
I know for a fact he hates Commies cus he picketed the movie Exodus
Well, I fin’ly started thinkin’ straight
When I run outa things to investigate
Couldn’t imagine doin’ anything else
So now I’m sittin’ home investigatin’ myself!
Hope I don’t find out anything . . . hmm, great God!

[Verse 1]
Well it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If'n you don't know by now
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It'll never do somehow
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I’ll be gone
You’re the reason I’m a-traveling on
But don’t think twice, it’s all right

[Verse 2]
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
The light I never knowed
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I’m on the dark side of the road
But I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
But we never did too much talking anyway
But don’t think twice, it’s all right

[Verse 3]
So it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
Like you never done before
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
I can’t hear you anymore
I’m a-thinking and a-wondering, walking down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I’m told
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don’t think twice, it’s all right

[Verse 4]
So long, honey babe
Where I’m bound, I can’t tell
Goodbye's too good a word, babe
So I’ll just say fare thee well
I ain't a-saying you treated me unkind
You could've done better, but I don’t mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don’t think twice, it’s all right
Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
With his wife and five children
And his cabin fallin’ down

You looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
You looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
Your children are so hungry
That they don’t know how to smile

Your baby’s eyes look crazy
They’re a-tuggin’ at your sleeve
Your baby’s eyes look crazy
They’re a-tuggin’ at your sleeve
You walk the floor and wonder why
With every breath you breathe
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
If there’s anyone that knows
Is there anyone that cares?

You prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
You prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
Your empty pockets tell yuh
That you ain’t a-got no friend

Your babies are crying louder
It’s pounding on your brain
Your babies are crying louder now
It’s pounding on your brain
Your wife’s screams are stabbin’ you
Like the dirty drivin’ rain

Your grass it is turning black
There’s no water in your well
Your grass is turning black
There’s no water in your well
You spent your last lone dollar
On seven shotgun shells
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That’s hangin’ on the wall

Your brain is a-bleedin’
And your legs can’t seem to stand
Your brain is a-bleedin’
And your legs can’t seem to stand
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That you’re holdin’ in your hand

There’s seven breezes a-blowin’
All around the cabin door
There’s seven breezes a-blowin’
All around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the ocean’s pounding roar

There’s seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
There’s seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Somewhere in the distance
There’s seven new people born
Come you masters of war
You that build all the guns
You that build the death planes
You that build the big bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks

You that never done nothin’
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it’s your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly

Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain
You fasten the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
As young people’s blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud

You’ve thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain’t worth the blood
That runs in your veins

How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I’m young
You might say I’m unlearned
But there’s one thing I know
Though I’m younger than you
Even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do
Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul

And I hope that you die
And your death’ll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I’ll watch while you’re lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I’ll stand o’er your grave
’Til I’m sure that you’re dead
Some time ago a crazy dream came to me
I dreamt I was walkin’ into World War Three
I went to the doctor the very next day
To see what kinda words he could say
He said it was a bad dream
I wouldn’t worry ’bout it none, though
They were my own dreams and they’re only in my head

I said, “Hold it, Doc, a World War passed through my brain”
He said, “Nurse, get your pad, this boy’s insane”
He grabbed my arm, I said, “Ouch!”
As I landed on the psychiatric couch
He said, “Tell me about it”

Well, the whole thing started at 3 o’clock fast
It was all over by quarter past
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
When I peeked out from a manhole cover
Wondering who turned the lights on

Well, I got up and walked around
And up and down the lonesome town
I stood a-wondering which way to go
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road
It was a normal day
Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
And I leaned my head and I gave a yell
“Give me a string bean, I’m a hungry man”
A shotgun fired and away I ran
I don’t blame them too much though, I know I look funny

Down at the corner by a hot-dog stand
I seen a man
I said, “Howdy friend, I guess there’s just us two”
He screamed a bit and away he flew
Thought I was a Communist

Well, I spied a girl and before she could leave
“Let’s go and play Adam and Eve”
I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin’
When she said, “Hey man, you crazy or sumpin’
You see what happened last time they started”

Well, I seen a Cadillac window uptown
And there was nobody aroun’
I got into the driver’s seat
And I drove down 42nd Street
In my Cadillac. Good car to drive after a war

Well, I remember seein’ some ad
So I turned on my Conelrad
But I didn’t pay my Con Ed bill
So the radio didn’t work so well
Turned on my record player—
It was Rock-a-day Johnny singin’, “Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa
Our Love’s A-gonna Grow Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah”
I was feelin’ kinda lonesome and blue
I needed somebody to talk to
So I called up the operator of time
Just to hear a voice of some kind
“When you hear the beep it will be three o’clock”
She said that for over an hour
And I hung up

Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then
Sayin’, “Hey I’ve been havin’ the same old dreams
But mine was a little different you see
I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me
I didn’t see you around”

Well, now time passed and now it seems
Everybody’s having them dreams
Everybody sees themselves
Walkin’ around with no one else
Half of the people can be part right all of the time
Some of the people can be all right part of the time
But all of the people can’t be all right all of the time
I think Abraham Lincoln said that
“I’ll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours”
I said that
While riding on a train goin’ west
I fell asleep for to take my rest
I dreamed a dream that made me sad
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had

With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon
Where we together weathered many a storm
Laughin’ and singin’ till the early hours of the morn

By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung
Our words were told, our songs were sung
Where we longed for nothin’ and were quite satisfied
Talkin’ and a-jokin’ about the world outside

With haunted hearts through the heat and cold
We never thought we could ever get old
We thought we could sit forever in fun
But our chances really was a million to one

As easy it was to tell black from white
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right
And our choices were few and the thought never hit
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split
How many a year has passed and gone
And many a gamble has been lost and won
And many a road taken by many a friend
And each one I’ve never seen again

I wish, I wish, I wish in vain
That we could sit simply in that room again
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat
I’d give it all gladly if our lives could be like that
I saw it advertised one day
Bear Mountain picnic was comin’ my way
“Come along ’n’ take a trip
We’ll bring you up there on a ship
Bring the wife and kids
Bring the whole family”
Yippee!

Well, I run right down ’n’ bought a ticket
To this Bear Mountain Picnic
But little did I realize
I was in for a picnic surprise
Had nothin’ to do with mountains
I didn’t even come close to a bear

Took the wife ’n’ kids down to the pier
Six thousand people there
Everybody had a ticket for the trip
“Oh well,” I said, “it’s a pretty big ship
Besides, anyway, the more the merrier”
Well, we all got on ’n’ what d’ya think
That big old boat started t’ sink
More people kept a-pilin’ on
That old ship was a-slowly goin’ down
Funny way t’ start a picnic

Well, I soon lost track of m’ kids ’n’ wife
So many people there I never saw in m’ life
That old ship sinkin’ down in the water
Six thousand people tryin’ t’ kill each other
Dogs a-barkin’, cats a-meowin’
Women screamin’, fists a-flyin’, babies cryin’
Cops a-comin’, me a-runnin’
Maybe we just better call off the picnic

I got shoved down ’n’ pushed around
All I could hear there was a screamin’ sound
Don’t remember one thing more
Just remember wakin’ up on a little shore
Head busted, stomach cracked
Feet splintered, I was bald, naked . . 
Quite lucky to be alive though

Feelin’ like I climbed outa m’ casket
I grabbed back hold of m’ picnic basket
Took the wife ’n’ kids ’n’ started home
Wishin’ I’d never got up that morn
Now, I don’t care just what you do
If you wanta have a picnic, that’s up t’ you
But don’t tell me about it, I don’t wanta hear it
’Cause, see, I just lost all m’ picnic spirit
Stay in m’ kitchen, have m’ own picnic . . 
In the bathroom

Now, it don’t seem to me quite so funny
What some people are gonna do f’r money
There’s a bran’ new gimmick every day
Just t’ take somebody’s money away
I think we oughta take some o’ these people
And put ’em on a boat, send ’em up to Bear Mountain . . 
For a picnic

[Verse 1]
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
I’ve stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I’ve walked and I’ve crawled on six crooked highways
I’ve stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I’ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I’ve been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard

[Chorus]
And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

[Verse 2]
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten-thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children

[Chorus]
And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

[Verse 3]
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing
I heard ten-thousand whispering and nobody listening
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley

[Chorus]
And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

[Verse 4]
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman, her body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded in hatred

[Chorus]
And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

[Verse 5]
And what will you do now, my blue-eyed son?
And what will you do now, my darling young one?
I’m a-going back out ’fore the rain starts a-falling
I’ll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
And the executioner’s face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I’ll tell it, and speak it, and think it, and breathe it
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then I’ll stand on the ocean until I start sinking
But I’ll know my song well before I start singing

[Chorus]
And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall
Takes rocks and gravel, baby, make a solid road
Make a solid road
Takes rocks and gravel, baby, make a solid road
Make a solid road

Takes a good woman mama
To satisfy my weary soul

Have you ever been down on that Mobil and K. C. line
Have you ever been down on that Mobil and K. C. line?

Well I just want to ask you
If you seen that gal of mine
Don't the clouds look lonesome shining across the sea
Don't the clouds look lonesome shining across the sea
Don't my gal look good
When she's comin' after me?
Oh, the cuckoo she's a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
But I never give her water
Till the forth day of July
It is often that I wonder
Why women love men
And I look back and I wonder
Why men are men
Oh, the cuckoo she's a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
But I never give her water
Till the forth day of July
Gonna build me another castle
On a mountain so high
So then I can see my true love
As she passes by
Oh, the cuckoo she's a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
But I never give her water
Till the forth day of July

[Verse 1]
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore
His mama sure was proud of him!
He stood straight and tall in his uniform and all
His mama’s face broke out all in a grin

[Verse 2]
“Oh son, you look so fine, I’m glad you’re a son of mine
You make me proud to know you hold a gun
Do what the captain says, lots of medals you will get
And we’ll put them on the wall when you come home”

[Verse 3]
As that old train pulled out, John’s ma began to shout
Telling’ everyone in the neighborhood:
“That’s my son that’s about to go, he’s a soldier now, you know”
She made well sure her neighbors understood

[Verse 4]
She got a letter once in a while and her face broke into a smile
As she showed them to the people from next door
And she bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
And these things you called a good old-fashioned war
Oh! Good old-fashioned war!

[Verse 5]
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come
They ceased to come for about ten months or more
Then a letter finally came saying, “Go down and meet the train
Your son’s a-coming home from the war”

[Verse 6]
She smiled and went right down, she looked everywhere around
But she could not see her soldier son in sight
But as all the people passed, she saw her son at last
When she did she could hardly believe her eyes

[Verse 7]
Oh his face was all shot up and his hand was all blown off
And he wore a metal brace around his waist
He whispered kind of slow, in a voice she did not know
While she couldn’t even recognize his face!

Oh! Lord! Not even recognize his face

[Verse 8]
“Oh tell me, my darling son, pray tell me what they done
How is it you come to be this way?”
He tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly move
And the mother had to turn her face away

[Verse 9]
“Don’t you remember, Ma, when I went off to war
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
I was on the battleground, you were home. Acting proud
You wasn’t there standing in my shoes”

[Verse 10]
“Oh, and I thought when I was there, God, what am I doing here?
I’m a-tryin’ to kill somebody or die tryin’
But the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came close
And I saw that his face looked just like mine”

Oh! Lord! Just like mine!

[Verse 11]
“And I couldn’t help but think, through the thunder rolling and stink
That I was just a puppet in a play
And through the roar and smoke, this string is finally broke
And a cannon ball blew my eyes away”

[Verse 12]
As he turned away to walk, his Ma was still in shock
At seeing’ the metal brace that helped him stand
But as he turned to go, he called his mother close
And he dropped his medals down into her hand

[Verse 1]
Ah, just in time
I found you just in time
Before you came my time
Was running low
I was lost
The losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed
Nowhere to go

[Chorus]
Now you're here
And now I know just where I'm going
No more doubt or fear
I've found my way
Yes, love came just in time
I found you just in time
To change my lonely life
That lucky day

[Verse 2]
Hey, just in time
I found you just in time
Before you came my time
Was running low
I was lost
The losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed
Nowhere to go

[Outro]
Oh, and now you're here
And now I know just where I'm going
No more doubt or fear
I've found my way, woo
Love came just in time
I found you just in time
To change my lonely life
That lucky day
Ooh, just in time
I found you just in time
To change my lonely life
That lucky day, ho

[Verse 1]
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Why did I choose you? What did I see in you?
Well, I saw the heart you hide so well
Oh, I saw a quiet girl (I saw a quiet girl)
Who had a gentle way, Lord
A way that caught me in its glowing spell
Oh darling

[Verse 2]
Why did I want you, baby? What could you offer me?
Just a love to last my lifetime through?
Oh, when I lost my heart so many years ago
Well, I lost it lovingly, honey
And I gave it all up willingly to you, to you, you

[Outro]
If I had to choose again, I would still choose you

[Announcer]
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mister Marvin Gaye

[Verse 1]
And so when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true
To prove that even wise men can be wrong
I concentrate on you
I concentrate and concentrate

[Verse 2]
Whenever skies look grey to me
And trouble begins to brew
Ah, whenever the winter winds become too strong
I concentrate on you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you

[Verse 3]
When fortune smiles and says "Nay, nay" to me
And people declare "We're through"
Ah, whenever the blues becomes my only song
I concentrate on you, you, you, you, you
You, you

[Bridge]
Ah, your smile, so sweet, so tender
Ah, at first your kiss I decline
The look in your eyes made me surrender
And once again our arms intertwine

[Verse 4]
And so when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never never never comes true
And just to prove that the wise men can be wrong
I concentrate on you

[Bridge]
Hey, your smile, so sweet, so tender
Ah, at first your kiss I decline
Ah-ha, the look in your eyes made me surrender
And once again our arms intertwine

[Outro]
And so when wise men say to me
Oh, that love's young dream never never comes true
And just to prove that the wise men can be wrong
I concentrate on, got me a thing going on
I concentrate on you

[Spoken Intro]
Thank you

[Chorus]
How sweet it is to be loved by you, yes, baby, huh
How sweet it is to be loved by you, oh darling

[Verse 1]
I needed the shelter of someone's arms
Honey, there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs
There you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotions

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to stop and thank you, baby
I want to stop and thank you, baby
Hey now

[Chorus]
How sweet it is to be loved by you
And I know it’s so sweet, darling
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Yes it is

[Verse 2]
I close my eyes at night
And wonder where would I be without you in my life
Everything iss just a bore
All the things I did, seems I'd done it before
But you brightened up all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to stop and thank you, baby
I want to stop and thank you, baby
Hey now

[Chorus]
How sweet it is to be loved by you
And I know, yes I know
How sweet it is to be loved by you
I want you to believe me, baby, oh yeah

You were better to me than I've been to myself
For me, there’s you, honey, nobody else
Stop, and thank you, baby
I just want to stop and thank you, baby
Hey now

[Chorus]
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Well, well, well, well, well
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Oh honey, have mercy

Ah, it's sweet, baby, how sweet it is
And I know it's so sweet being loved by you, honey
Ah baby, huh, oh, it's so sweet

And tell 'em "How sweet it is"
Tell 'em "How sweet it is"
They’re sitting next to you, how sweet it is, haha
Oh, how sweet it is to be loved by you, come on, baby, ah

You’re very very kind

Were about to debut a medley of songs
Songs we recorded quite a few years back
We sincerely hope that they're still your favorites and that you enjoy them
Gonna dedicate these to all you wonderful folks out there

Can I Get A Witness

[Verse]
Ah, listen everybody, especially you girls
Tell me, is it right to be left alone
While the one you love is never home?
I love too hard, my friends sometimes say
But I believe, I believe
A woman should be loved that way
But it hurts me so inside
To see her treat me so unkind
So somebody, somewhere, I want to tell her it ain't fair
I need a witness

You're A Wonderful One

[Verse]
You are so wonderful
That being near you is all that I'm living for
You show me more kindness in little ways
Than I've ever known in all my days
Tell me we'll stay together
Let me love you forever
'Cause you're a wonderful one
You're wonderful, baby, yeah, ah

Stubborn Kind Of Fellow

I try to put my arms around you

But every time I reach for you, baby
And try to kiss you, you jump out of sight
I've got news for you
A-little girl, little girl, I've made plans for two

[Chorus]
I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up to love you
Did you hear me?

Go down to the river and there I'll be

And now you're moving on up, pretty baby
You're leaving me behind
Everybody seems to love you
Girl, you're doing just fine, fine, fine

Take away your good looks
And all your fancy clothes
Why don't you just try it, baby
Try it, baby
Try it, baby
You got to try it, baby
Oh, you'll see na-na-na-nobody loves you but me
Ah, nobody loves you but me

One More Heartache

[Verse]
Ah, one more heartache, I can't take it
My heart is carryin' such a heavy load
One more ache would break it
Just like the camel with the heavy pack
One last straw was added, they say it broke the camel's back

[Outro]
I, I, I can't stand it, I can't take it
No no, honey, I can't stand it
Not a, not a, not a, not another heartache
Why would you wanna break my heart?
I wanna know why you wanna break my heart
Tell me, honey, why why why

Don't I love you, baby? Don't I love you?
I, I've been loving you since you was five-years-old
I need you, darling, ow
I, yi, yi, yi, yi, oh I, couldn't take another one
Not another heartache, no, no, no
Not another heartache, no, no, no, ooh

Thank you, ladies and gentlemen

[Spoken Intro]
Last summer we had the pleasure of being in Brazil
Before we begin, first, there must be lights
Music, and of course, girls
Now, in Brazil, when the natives wanted something very badly
They wanted to pray in Latin for it
But since they could not speak it, they made up words that had a Latin sound
They sounded something like this

[Chorus]
Laia, ladaia, sabatana, Ave Maria
Laia, ladaia, sabatana, Ave Maria

[Verse]
I've been searching for love
I've been longing for love
Oh, oh, where is she?
Since the love I offered hasn't found another
Then I know what I'd better do
Oh yes, I'll wait for you
Or I may just spend my whole life all alone

[Chorus]
Laia, ladaia, sabatana, Ave Maria
Laia, ladaia, sabatana, Ave Maria

[Refrain]
If it's not enough, my prayer
Send me someone to care

[Chorus]
Laia, ladaia, sabatana, Ave Maria
Laia, ladaia, sabatana, Ave Maria

Laia, ladaia, sabatana, Ave Maria
Laia, ladaia, sabatana, Ave Maria

[Refrain]
Please, my friend, hear my prayer
Oh, send me someone to care

[Chorus]
Laia, ladaia, sabatana, Ave Maria
Laia, ladaia, sabatana, Ave Maria

Laia, ladaia, sabatana, Ave Maria
Laia, ladaia, sabatana, Ave Maria

[Outro]
I'm still searching for love
I'm still longing for love
Oh, oh, where is she?
Since the love I offered hasn't found another
Then I know what I'd better do
Oh yes, oh yes, I'll wait for you
Oh, I may spend my whole life all alone
All alone, searching for love
Longing for love
I need your love
Ah, I'm searching, searching, searching, ah

[Verse 1]
Honey, you do me wrong but still i'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and i can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers grow from rain
But how can love grow through pain?

[Chorus]
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-ality
Ain't that peculiar, baby
Peculiar as can be

[Verse 2]
Oh, you tell me lies that should be obvious to me
Ah, but I'm so much in love with you, baby, 'til i don't wanna see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all your lies seem true
If the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger?

[Chorus]
Ain't that peculiar, baby
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-ality

[Bridge]
Ah yeah
One more time I want you to say
Say "Ah ah ah"
Say "Hey hey"
"Ah ah ah"
"Hey hey"
"Ah ah ah, ah ah ah"
Now now now

[Verse 3]
I cried so much just like a child that's lost a toy
Oh, maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
But a child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears?

[Chorus]
Ain't that peculiar, baby
Peculiar as can be
Ain't it funny
A peculiar-ality

[Outro]
I don't under-stand it
No no no, no, honey
Listen
Sometimes, I get a feeling
All in my bones, a good ol' feeling running through me
And it's alright, a good ol' feeling now now
It's alright
It's in my feet, oh, it's in my arms
It's all over me, and it's wonderful
Makes me wanna start to shout
Sometimes I feel like, honey, I wanna shout
I think I'll shout, oh, I got to shout
Na na na...
Baby, well, it's alright
Said it's alright, honey, it's alright
Woo, ain't it funny? Ain't it peculiar?
Oh baby, ain't it peculiar?

[Verse 1]
Every once in a while
Every once in a long, long while
Fellas got to bust out
Shoot the whole dang pile
Every once in a while
Every once in a long, long while
Got to shake the dust off
Make the devil smile
Feel your insides on fire
Call the whole wide world a liar
Stand up, stand up higher than a mile

[Refrain]
Every once in a while
Every once in a long, long while
Got to shake the dust off
Head for hair in style
Time for fun
Today's my once in a while

[Verse 2]
Well, every once in a while
Every once in a long, long while
Oh, fellas got to bust out
Shoot the whole dang pile
I know that once in a while
Every once in a long while
Gotta shake the dust off
Make the devil smile
Oh, you got to feel your insides are on fire
Got to whole the wide world a liar
Stand up, stand up higher than a mile

[Refrain]
Every once in a while
Every once in a long while
Oh, gotta clean the rust off
Head for hair in style
Oh baby, time for fun
Today's my once in a while, woo
Today is my, my, my once in a while

[Outro]
Hey, ow, I'm havin' a ball, y'all

Thank you, ladies and gentlemen

[Verse 1]
Summer, not a bit of breeze
Neon signs are shining through the tired trees
Lovers walking to and fro
Everyone has someone and a place to go

[Verse 2]
Listen, hear the cars go past
They don't even see me flying by so fast
Lovers walking to and fro
Everyone has someone and a place to go

[Bridge]
Ah, where do you go
When you feel that your brain, your brain is on fire?
Ah, where do you go
When you don't even know what it is you desire?

Listen, laughter's everywhere
Ah, hear it, life is in the air

[Verse 3]
And as the night comes and the town awakes
Sounds of children calling
And the squeal of brakes
Ah, music but a lonely song
When you can't, can't help wondering
Where do I belong
Music but a lonely song
When you can't, oh, you can't help wondering
Where do I belong

[Outro]
Oh, oh, mmm, mmm
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Yeah yeah, you are, hey hey, my pride and joy
And I love you, love you, darlin'
Like a baby boy loves his toy
You've got kisses sweeter than honey
I work seven days a week to give you all my money
That's why you are my pride and joy

[Chorus]
And I'm tellin' the world
You're my pride and joy
I believe I'm your baby boy
And I know you're mine, my pride and joy
Yeah, baby, oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
You are, have mercy, my pride and joy
And a love like mine, hey baby
Is something nobody can ever destroy
You pick me up when I'm down
Oh, when we go out, pretty baby
You shake up the whole town
And that's why I believe you're my pride and joy

[Chorus]
And I say yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh, pride and joy
Ooh baby, oh, I'm your baby
I know you're my pride and joy
And I love you, love you, darlin'
Oh, my pride and joy

[Bridge]
Ah baby, honey
Said I believe I'm, oh, I'm your baby boy
And I hope that you're my pride and joy
And I know because you're my pride and joy, yes you are
Oh baby, huh, everything's alright
Said I believe I'm, I'm your baby boy
And I hope that you're my pride and joy
And I love you 'cause you're my pride and joy
Woo, yeah

[Outro]
Ladies and gentlemen, everybody has a pride and joy, everybody
As I look around the club, I can see several pride and joys
Pride and joy sitting over there, I see you pride and joys over there, haha
Everybody has a pride and joy
Pride and joy sitting right there, wonderful
How you pride and joys in the balcony?
Everybody has a pride and joy, uh-huh
Pride and joy sitting right here, you got to be pride and joys
Yeah baby
If you don't believe everybody has a pride and joy, ladies and gentlemen
I'll prove it to you
Before I do that, there's a man with two pride and joys, haha
Everybody has a pride and joy, yeah yeah
Now, see this couple sitting right over here, pride and joys
How are you, sir? Nice to meet you
Pride and joys, folks—how are you? Wonderful
Is he your baby boy? Yes, yes, yes
And she's your pride and joy? Could be?
Now, wait a minute, you gotta get that together, haha
She is your pride and joy, before I go any further—yeah, she said yeah
Wasn't about a thing, I knew it all the time
Put your arm around her, that's right, pull her—that's right, that's right
Give him some sugar—naw, naw, that will never do
That will never do
Give him some good sugar, baby, smack dab in the middle where it counts
Whip it on him
Give them a great big round of applause right here, folks, haha
Wonderful, pride and joy, wonderful
Hey baby, I'm your baby boy
You want any trouble? Haha
Do you want any trouble back there?
Rather I don't come back there messing around? Is that okay?
Is that your pride and joy sitting there? Oh, fine
You know, sometimes you run into guys with their pride and joys, you know
You don't want any trouble, nice to see you folks
Na na na na na na, now folks, I want you all to clap your hands with me right here on this beat
Everybody, I see you, brother

Pride and joy
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen
Thank you

[Verse 1]
You're walkin' along the street, or you're at a party
Or else you're alone and then you suddenly dig
You're looking in someone's eyes, you suddenly realize
That this could be the start of something big
You're lunching at Twenty-One and watchin' your diet
Declining a charlotte russe, accepting a fig
When out of a clear blue sky, it's suddenly gal and guy
Ah, this could be the start of something big

[Bridge]
There's no controlling the unrolling of your fate, my friend
Who knows what's written in the magic book
Ah, when a lover you discover at the gate, my friend
Ah, invite her in without a second look

[Verse 2]
You're up in an aeroplane or dining at Sardi's
Or lunching at Malibu alone on the sand
I suddenly hear a bell, and right away you can tell
That this could be the start of something grand
Yeah, this could be the start of something big
This could be the start, this could be the start
This could be the start of something, something big, yeah

[Outro]
Thank you, folks

[Intro]
Everything I said I'd do, I did
Oh yeah, come through
Everything I said I'd do, I did
Oh yeah, uh

[Verse]
But baby, let's face it, I'm not into dating
I haven't been patient
Ever since I been famous my time has been racing
My motives are basic, this life I've been chasing
These hearts I've been breaking
And these girls I been tasting don't never get naked
Just put it in a ponytail, fuck 'em from behind
Fuck 'em with their clothes on, panties to the side
Put the panties to the side, like a don do
Get it wet, let it slide like a sunroof
Got goals, got dreams, got hoes, got cribs
Got niggas that'll die for a prince
Got my city on lock, XO 'til the death
Left town in a coach, came back in a jet

[Outro]
Come through, I'm not living like I did before
Come through, um, I said come through
Everything I said I'd do, I did
Come through, oh yeah
Oh, come through
I've been out there puttin' down that work
Come through, oh yeah, I said come through
Everything I said I'd do, I did
Come through, come through, ohh

[Spoken]
Thank you very kindly, ladies and gentlemen
We'd like to take the time that we have presently to have you say hello to some of the wonderful gentlemen on stage who are, of course, making it all possible for us
Before we do, may I express my sincere appreciation for your being such a warm, cordial audience
Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to have you meet my very competent musical director
He's a good friend, he's a composer, terrific alto saxophonist
He's also this year's—he's this year's pole vaulting champion
No, no, no, wanna have a great big round of applause for Mister Maurice King right here, ladies and gentlemen
We think the orchestra's, think the orchestra's doing a marvelous job
We'd like to have them stand up and take a well-deserved round of applause—gentlemen
You're very kind

[Spoken Intro]
My favorite ballad

[Verse 1]
Who can I turn to, when nobody needs me?
My heart wants to know, and so I must go where destiny leads me
With no star to guide me, and no one beside me
I'll go on my way, and after today, the darkness will hide me

[Verse 2]
And maybe tomorrow, I'll find what I'm after
I'll throw out my sorrow, beg, steal, or borrow my share of laughter
With you I could learn to, with you on a new day
But who can I turn to, if you turn away?

[Outro]
Maybe tomorrow, yeah yeah, yes, I'll find what I'm after
I'll throw out my sorrow, beg, steal, or borrow my share of laughter
With you I could learn to, with you on a new day
But who can I turn to, if you turn away?

[Spoken Intro]
Thank you, folks
We'd like to give you just a bit more of the Motown sound
All the way from Detroit, Michigan

I'll Be Doggone

[Verse 1]
Well, I'll be doggone if I wouldn't work all day, baby
And I'll be doggone if I wouldn't bring you my pay, baby
But if I ever caught you running around
Throwing my money all over this town

[Chorus]
Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey, Hey! I'd be long gone
Oh baby, I wouldn't be doggone
Baby, I'd be long gone

I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch)

[Verse]
Ah, sugar pie, honey bunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else

[Outro]
Ah, when I call your name
Girl, it starts a flame
Burning in my heart, tearing it all apart
No matter how I try
Your love I can't deny
Burning, burning, burn me inside
Oh, ah-ah, baby, woo

Uptight (Everything's Alright)

[Chorus]
Baby, everything is all right, it's uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, it's uptight, clean out of sight

[Verse 1]
I'm a poor man's son, from across the railroad track
The only clothes I had hangin' on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy
Oh, I'm the apple of my girl's eye

[Bridge]
I can't give her the things that money can buy
But I'll never, never, never make my baby cry

[Outro]
And it's all right 'cause my clothes ain't new
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says, baby, everything is alright, it's uptight, and I know out of sight

Hitch Hike

[Intro]

[Outro]
Ladies and gentlemen, I wanna tell you a little story right here
But you've got to use your imagination
Now, suppose I were standing out here on a dark, cold freeway
And all the cars were passing me by
And nobody wanted to give me a ride
Now, I'm determined to get to my baby's side
And that's why I'm out here hitchhiking
Trying, trying to get me a ride
Trying, oh trying to get me a ride
I need a ride now, now, now, yeah, oh yeah
But it's so cold out here, I'm freezing
Lord, it's cold, woo
I'm freezing, woo, it's cold out here
And I need a ride, I need a ride
Wait a minute, I think I see a car coming
Hold it! Hey!
Passed me by, oh, yes she did
Can't get no ride
No no no no, can't get no ride
I, I'm cold out here
Wait a minute, I see another car coming
Hey!
Passed me by, oh, can't get no ride
Now what can I do now now now? What can I do?
I need a ride, they keep passing me by
What can I do now now now?
Listen, folks, I better put this microphone down and do some serious hitchhiking out here
I'ma get me a ride, hold it
I have changed my mind
Yep, I changed my mind
You see, I've been doing this hitch hike now for five years, and I ain't got no ride yet
So tonight, instead of doing that hitch hike, I think I'll do the Philly Dog
Haha, I'll do that Philly Dog, baby, maybe I'll get a ride doing that, ah yeah

[Verse]
I still recall when we first met
That very night I can't forget
And I could feel the way you move
I knew right then you'd fit my groove
I should have known, oh, by the past
That this here love just couldn't last
You said you'd never say bye-bye
You told a lie, you told a lie
You made me need you more each day
You took care of business and did not play
Now you want me to give you up
I just can't drink that bitter cup
I just can't get you off my mind
Without your love, I'm slowly dying
I need you so, can't let you go

[Bridge]
I should be smilin' by now, oh my love
With some new tender friend
Ah, smilin' by now, with my heart on the mend

[Outro]
And when I try, oh, when I try
There's something in my heart says "No, no"
You're still here and you're with me, baby
I wish, yeah, I wish I didn't love you so, ah baby
No, no, but I do, baby
I love you, love you so, ooh
Wish I didn't need your love

[Verse]
Girl, I've got good news
They won't see me crying anymore
I won't have to weep 'cause we're separated
And what about these teardrops?
Ah girl, they're gonna leave
You've got your loving power forever lasting hanging all around me
I know I'm through with crying
I shed a million tears
No happiness since we parted, it was all in vain

[?]
'Cause all I've got loving you, girl, is understanding
That a foolish beginner, that's me
You know that I won't have to cry
I'll forget you for too long, baby
Ah, can't you see me closing the door?
'Cause darling, I guess there's someone else who's willing to fall for me
That door separates me with love, separates memories, too
And though all the peace I find is when I'm thinking 'bout you
Here's what I won't do
I won't cry, I won't cry no more
For your satisfaction and your peace of mind
You still got that love power over me

[Chorus]
Everywhere everywhere, everywhere I go
Everywhere that I've been the only thing I see is
Is beautiful people, beautiful people
Beautiful people, beautiful people

I guess I gotta go there
(Let it be beautiful)
(You love me, beautiful)
(You love me, beautiful)
(You love me, beautiful)
(You love me, beautiful)

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
You're hearing rumors about me and you can't stomach the thought
Of someone touching my body when you're so close to my heart
I won't deny what they saying because most of it is true
But it was all before I fell for you, so please, babe
(You love me, beautiful)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
So please, babe
(You love me, beautiful)
(You love me, beautiful)
I don't wanna go there
(You love me, beautiful)
We should never go there
(You love me, beautiful)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
(I don't wanna go there)
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
(We should never go there)
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
(Damn)
Let it be beautifu-u-ul
Let it be beautiful
Let it be beautifu-u-ul
Let it be beautiful

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Everything I say right now is gonna be used in another fight
And I've been through this so many times
Can we change the subject?
You gonna start asking me questions like
"Was she attractive? Was she an actress?"
Baby, the fact is

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You're hearing rumors about me and saw some pictures online
Saying they got you so angry, making you wish you were blind
Before we start talking crazy, saying some things we'll regret
Can we just slow it down?

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
(I don't wanna go there)
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
(We should never go there)
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful

[Bridge: Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown]
Beautiful
Let it be beautiful
Just let the past, just be the past
Let it be beautiful
And focused on things that are gonna make us laugh
(Let it be beautiful)
Take me as I am and not who I was
Let it be beautiful
I'll promise I'll be the one that you can trust, so please
(Let it be beautiful)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful (Before it gets beautiful)
Please don't judge me (So please don't) and I won't judge you (No, I won't)
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful

[Outro: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]

Damn, why you wanna go there?

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You're hearing rumors about me and saw some pictures online
Saying they got you so angry, making you wish you were blind
Before we start talking crazy, saying some things we'll regret
Can we just slow it down and press reset? (Damn)
You're beautiful, so baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
(So baby)
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Just let the past, just be the past
And focused on things that are gonna make us laugh
Take me as I am (Take me as I am) and not who I was (Not who I was)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
So please don't judge me (Don't judge me)

Guwop
Tryna send it to ya' right now
And they dirt cheap
What you on?
Call

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm trying to sell it to you cheap nigga, dirt cheap
You know I sell dope in my sleep, but I don't sleep
You know I sell codeine that lean for a good number
And I got white squares of that clean and that green ganja
I got that shit that make a fiend have extreme hunger
Look like she 50, but I swear she like 10 years younger
These 'sace shades on me and now I feel like Stevie Wonder
But when you go to jail to them your just another number
I called this bitch from jail and made she changed the fucking number
That shit be selling to your back and make you goin" under
I'm in that boat motherfucker, traffic bumper bumper
I got your bitch with me and guess what man I'm about to fuck her
'Wop

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I jus' bought 6 pints and they dirt cheap
'Cause every dope boy alive wanna serve me
She gave me top 'til I start burstin'
I ain't pay her, but that bitch charge dirt cheap
What you want? Bitch I got it dirt cheap
50 for a show, 20 for a feat'
Pull up in that Beamer 2013
I got it dirt cheap

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Dirt cheap, got that dirty white
I'm talkin' dirt no 

[?]
Dealing out these dirty junkie houses, all these dirty dishes
3 days straight wit' dirty clothes, wit' dirty socks and dirty drugs
8 ball under 30 balls
Now 8 cost 

[?]
I'm at Louis, I'm at Fendi, it ain't nothin' in this store dirt cheap
I'm wit' my dime piece, a new time piece, I got a new multi-million dollar mouth piece
Most diamonds than a jewel thief, 

[?] for animal cruelty
All these accusations of this bullshit make it extra hard to insure me
I'm aggravated, I remeditated, I put my mind on a million
Smokin' Kush in my penthouse and they done put me out of the building
Too many Lambos in the parking lot, move me out the sub-division
I'm runnin' the city, I'm runnin' the streets, campaign like politician
'Wop

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I jus' bought 6 pints and they dirt cheap
'Cause every dope boy alive wanna serve me
She gave me top 'til I start burstin'
I ain't pay her, but that bitch charge dirt cheap
What you want? Bitch I got it dirt cheap
50 for a show, 20 for a feat'
Pull up in that Beamer 2013
I got it dirt cheap

[Verse]
Yeah, well I'm, just being honest my conscience ain't doin' bad
Because I try to minus the problems that I attract
And half the time the wheels that's in the back of my mind just keep on turning 'til the tires flat and burn until the fire cracks
I do not lie, though facts may seem a little far-fetched
It's only 'cause I may be make believe and full of darkness when I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place
Walk and droppin' change inside your empty guitar case, that charity, uh
I move carelessly, that's why I'm always trippin'
And yes I like electrolytes they help me go the distance
Not too efficient but the way it's always been
Until the day we have to meet again

[Chorus]
Here to wait when it ain't really safe and it don't seem right
But what's new, you'll get used to the bullshit, this room they gon' mess up
It's likely, they might be, but

[Instrumental]

No Trina, but my bitch the baddest, she not average, she a savage

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
I'm all 'bout my bread, oh no, I just can't trust these niggas
If you need that work, I'll drop that off, yeah, I deliver
Just be sure to count that up, no, don't be short one dollar
'Cause I need all mine, if it cross that line, you gon' make me pop that yopper, bang, bang

Don't you play with my bread (Bang, bang)
Don't you play with my head (Bang, bang)
Don't you play with my bread

[Open Instrumental]

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
I'm all 'bout my bread, oh no, I just can't trust these niggas
If you need that work, I'll drop that off, yeah, I deliver

'Cause I need all mine, if it cross that line, you gon' make me pop that yopper, bang, bang
Don't you play with my head (Bang, bang)
Don't you play with my bread (Bang, bang)

It's what you do, it's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Little inflated Bahamas shades, oops
Bright as the sun (Sun, sun, sun)
But you can copy the rest, I'm the best
I'm already the one (One, one, one)
You're down, you're down
Let the paramedics sweep you away, away
Medicated so I can't feel my face, my face
Brain rattlin' but check out my Js (Js, Js, Js)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You ain't a man and your girl my biggest fan
And she wanna see me stand up
Your girl, she wanna get stuck
Here the plan, I'ma take her by the hands
And show her how it feel again
And gettin' fast, gettin' fast, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ester Dean]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
She don't want no rapper, want a singa

Singa, singa, singa

She don't want no rapper, want a singa
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
(Sit your ass down, sit your ass down)
Singa, singa, singa
(Sit your ass down)
Singa

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Lookin' at your booty, so amazed
Where did you get it from?
I got that gold records, double XL
You want my water gun
Can I wear it out, it out?
Let's be frank about it, I want it now, it now
Bring more shots and get you back to the house
I know you want it, girl, what you talkin' 'bout?
Hey, hey

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You ain't a man and your girl my biggest fan
And she wanna see me stand up
Your girl, she wanna get stuck
Here the plan, I'ma take her by the hands
And show her how it feel again
And gettin' fast, gettin' fast, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ester Dean]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
'Cause she, 'cause she, she don't want no rapper, want a singa
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Singa, singa, singa (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause she don't want no rapper, want a singa
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
(Sit your ass down, you better sit your ass down)
Singa, singa, singa
(You better sit your ass down, you better)
She don't want no rapper, want a singa (Hey)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

Singa, singa, singa
(Sit your ass down)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Look at Breeze (Yeah), Polo V (Yeah)
Enzo shiny, you don't notice me (Uh)
Endos, nah, I don't blow no trees
And my gas tank full so I ain't on E
She wanna roll with a star
I think it's 'bout time I let it go that far
'Cause I already know when I can win that heart
'Cause she keep her booty bouncin' like a bungee cord
Or, never no trampoline
'Cause all the good girls comin' come with me
Hold up, wait, stop
Ayy, I like your face
But I don't see that when you move your waist
Come on, lil' mama, let me take his place
And the other dude's lame, he's a frosted flake
When singers come around, we shut 'em down
That's just the way it goes

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ester Dean]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
She don't want no rapper, want a singa
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Singa, singa, singa
She don't want no rapper, want a singa
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
(Sit your ass down, sit your ass down)
Singa, singa, singa
(Sit your ass down)
She don't want no rapper, want a singa
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
(Sit your ass down, sit your ass down)
Singa, singa, singa
(Sit your ass down)
Singa

[Intro]
Whoops, it's your bad
It's your bad
Uh-uh, it's your bad
Ayy, ayy, come on
(Give it to me!)

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I seen shawty lookin' right below my waist
"I wanna get down" written on her face
Let the world turn around while I stand in place
I'm a shot on the rocks, you don't need no chase

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Hey, be cool (Be cool)
'Cause I'm feeling myself, it's like yeah
Hey (Hey)
Who with you? (Who with you?)
'Cause they can all rock out with my crew
(Give it to me!)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
With a touch like that
Shawty, I can't fight it
I want you
And when you leanin' up on me
Your body is callin'
I'm on you
Can you feel it? (Hey, hey)
You're drivin' me insane
Can you feel it? (Hey, hey)
You're the only one to blame
It ain't my fault that you look like that (Whoops)
It's your bad (It's your bad)
It's your bad (It's your bad)
It ain't my fault that you look like that (Whoops)
It's your bad (It's your bad)
It's your bad (It's your bad)
(Hey, hey come on)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Baby in the mirror lookin' back at me
Sexy and you know it, throw it back at me
Got a sweet tooth, you're all the sugar I need
I keep a spoon for your pudding, can I get it to leave?

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Hey, it's all hood (It's all hood)
We can do the most like all day
Hey
Club is pulled through
'Cause you know tonight who's leavin' with you
(Give it to me!)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Lil Wayne]
With a touch like that
Shawty, I can't fight it
I want you (Yeah, I want you)
And when you leanin' up on me (Yeah, oh)
Your body is callin'
I'm on you (I'm on you, yeah)
Can you feel it? (Hey, hey, can you feel it, girl?)
You're drivin' me insane
Can you feel it? (Hey, hey, yeah)
You're the only one to blame
It ain't my fault that you look like that (Whoops, oh no, oh no)
It's your bad (It's your bad)
It's your bad (It's your bad)
It ain't my fault that you look like that (Whoops, yeah)
(Chris, I got you)
It's your bad (It's your bad)
It's your bad (It's your bad)
(Uh)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, Weezy F baby, Polo horses on my underwear
Baby, I'm a beast and your boyfriend a gummy bear
We-Well can I at least put some kisses on you under there?
Ma-Man, it ain't my fault, I want you badder than some fucking air
Hundred millionaire, I'll take you anywhere
I put a ring on it and make you really care
Now what's really good? It-It's Young Moolah, baby
Yeah, guns and roses and tulips, baby
Ha, I do this, baby, now come and do it with me
Because I'm right, I'm right, like a New Amendment, ha
Now I'm right with your ass
And if you fall in love after tonight, it's your bad

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
With a touch like that
Shawty, I can't fight it
I want you
And when you leanin' up on me
Your body is callin'
I'm on you
Can you feel it? (Hey, hey)
You're drivin' me insane
Can you feel it? (Hey, hey)
You're the only one to blame
With a touch like that
Shawty, I can't fight it
I want you
And when you leanin' up on me
Your body is callin'
I'm on you
Can you feel it? (Hey, hey)
You're drivin' me insane
Can you feel it? (Hey, hey)
You're the only one to blame

[Verse 1]
Broken glass everywhere
One second feels like a lifetime
No one around, but you were there
Play it back in my mind
I should stop, hold up
I feel like I'm going crazy
No one cares, I'm all alone
And no one there to save me

[Pre-Chorus]
Take from my heart just like you take from my soul
I wanna erase from my mind but I can't let go (Go, go, yeah)
Eyes open wide, feel like I'm gonna die (Oh-oh)
And I just wanna get out, I'm scared right now
Pinching myself tryna get up

[Chorus]
I don't wanna sleep no more
'Cause every time I close my eyes, all I see is you
I don't wanna dream about it
I don't wanna dream about it
I don't wanna sleep no more
When I hear you call, I wanna wake up
I don't wanna dream about it
I don't wanna dream about it
You're a nightmare

[Verse 2]
Lookin' in the mirror
Got a funny feelin'
Déjà vu, like I been here before
And yeah, it's all gettin' clearer
Ever had a feelin' like it's something that they needed you to know? Oh
It's hauntin' me
Must feel alone tonight
My body is shakin'
And I'm scared for my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Take from my heart just like you take from my soul
I wanna erase from my mind but I can't let go (Go, go, yeah)
Eyes open wide, feel like I'm gonna die (Oh-oh)
And I just wanna get out, I'm scared right now
Pinching myself tryna get up

[Chorus]
I don't wanna sleep no more
'Cause every time I close my eyes, all I see is you
I don't wanna dream about it
I don't wanna dream about it
I don't wanna sleep no more
When I hear you call, I wanna wake up
I don't wanna dream about it
I don't wanna dream about it
You're a nightmare

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I don't wanna sleep no more
'Cause every time I close my eyes, all I see is you
I don't wanna dream about it
I don't wanna dream about it
I don't wanna sleep no more
When I hear you call, I wanna wake up
I don't wanna dream about it
I don't wanna dream about it
You're a nightmare

[Outro: Soulja Boy]
Ayy, ayy
Sun is shining...

[x2]
Sun is shining, the weather is sweet
Make you want to move your dancing feet
When the morning gathers the rainbow
Want you to know I'm a rainbow too

I'm a rainbow too...

Sun is shining...

Sun is shining, the weather is sweet
Make you want to move your dancing feet
When the morning gathers the rainbow
Want you to know I'm a rainbow too

I'm a rainbow too...
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms
You should not treat me like a stranger
Our Father would not like the way that you act
And you must realize the danger

Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you
And one deserving of affection?
And is our purpose not the same on this earth
To love and follow His direction?

We grew up together
From the cradle to the grave
We died and were reborn
And then mysteriously saved

Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door
Don’t turn away, you’ll create sorrow
Time is an ocean but it ends at the shore
You may not see me tomorrow
I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
No, I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
Well, I wake in the morning
Fold my hands and pray for rain
I got a head full of ideas
That are drivin’ me insane
It’s a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor
I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more

I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more
No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more
Well, he hands you a nickel
He hands you a dime
He asks you with a grin
If you’re havin’ a good time
Then he fines you every time you slam the door
I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more

I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more
No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more
Well, he puts his cigar
Out in your face just for kicks
His bedroom window
It is made out of bricks
The National Guard stands around his door
Ah, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more
I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more
No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more
Well, she talks to all the servants
About man and God and law
Everybody says
She’s the brains behind pa
She’s sixty-eight, but she says she’s twenty-four
I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more

I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
No, I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
Well, I try my best
To be just like I am
But everybody wants you
To be just like them
They sing while you slave and I just get bored
I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
Down the street the dogs are barkin’
And the day is a-gettin’ dark
As the night comes in a-fallin’
The dogs’ll lose their bark
An’ the silent night will shatter
From the sounds inside my mind
For I’m one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind

From the crossroads of my doorstep
My eyes they start to fade
As I turn my head back to the room
Where my love and I have laid
An’ I gaze back to the street
The sidewalk and the sign
And I’m one too many mornings
An’ a thousand miles behind

It’s a restless hungry feeling
That don’t mean no one no good
When ev’rything I’m a-sayin’
You can say it just as good
You’re right from your side
I’m right from mine
We’re both just one too many mornings
An’ a thousand miles behind
Oh, the ragman draws circles
Up and down the block
I’d ask him what the matter was
But I know that he don’t talk
And the ladies treat me kindly
And furnish me with tape
But deep inside my heart
I know I can’t escape
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Well, Shakespeare, he’s in the alley
With his pointed shoes and his bells
Speaking to some French girl
Who says she knows me well
And I would send a message
To find out if she’s talked
But the post office has been stolen
And the mailbox is locked
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
Mona tried to tell me
To stay away from the train line
She said that all the railroad men
Just drink up your blood like wine
An’ I said, “Oh, I didn’t know that
But then again, there’s only one I’ve met
An’ he just smoked my eyelids
An’ punched my cigarette”
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Grandpa died last week
And now he’s buried in the rocks
But everybody still talks about
How badly they were shocked
But me, I expected it to happen
I knew he’d lost control
When he built a fire on Main Street
And shot it full of holes
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Now the senator came down here
Showing ev’ryone his gun
Handing out free tickets
To the wedding of his son
An’ me, I nearly got busted
An’ wouldn’t it be my luck
To get caught without a ticket
And be discovered beneath a truck
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
Now the preacher looked so baffled
When I asked him why he dressed
With twenty pounds of headlines
Stapled to his chest
But he cursed me when I proved it to him
Then I whispered, “Not even you can hide
You see, you’re just like me
I hope you’re satisfied”
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Now the rainman gave me two cures
Then he said, “Jump right in”
The one was Texas medicine
The other was just railroad gin
An’ like a fool I mixed them
An’ it strangled up my mind
An’ now people just get uglier
An’ I have no sense of time
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

When Ruthie says come see her
In her honky-tonk lagoon
Where I can watch her waltz for free
’Neath her Panamanian moon
An’ I say, “Aw come on now
You must know about my debutante”
An’ she says, “Your debutante just knows what you need
But I know what you want”
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
Where the neon madmen climb
They all fall there so perfectly
It all seems so well timed
An’ here I sit so patiently
Waiting to find out what price
You have to pay to get out of
Going through all these things twice
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Whatever colors you have in your mind
I’ll show them to you and you’ll see them shine

Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
Until the break of day, let me see you make him smile
His clothes are dirty but his hands are clean
And you’re the best thing that he’s ever seen

Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
Why wait any longer for the world to begin
You can have your cake and eat it too
Why wait any longer for the one you love
When he’s standing in front of you

Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead
I long to see you in the morning light
I long to reach for you in the night
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead
’Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”

And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured
I’ll always do my best for her, on that I give my word
In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”

Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place where it’s always safe and warm
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”

I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes an’ blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”

Suddenly I turned around and she was standin’ there
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”
Now there’s a wall between us, somethin’ there’s been lost
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”

Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much, it’s doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”

I’ve heard newborn babies wailin’ like a mournin’ dove
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”

In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation an’ they gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”

Well, I’m livin’ in a foreign country but I’m bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor’s edge, someday I’ll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”
Our conversation was short and sweet
It nearly swept me off-a my feet
And I’m back in the rain, oh, oh
And you are on dry land
You made it there somehow
You’re a big girl now

Bird on the horizon, sittin’ on a fence
He’s singin’ his song for me at his own expense
And I’m just like that bird, oh, oh
Singin’ just for you
I hope that you can hear
Hear me singin’ through these tears

Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
Oh, but what a shame if all we’ve shared can’t last
I can change, I swear, oh, oh
See what you can do
I can make it through
You can make it too
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase
You’ve known it all the time, I’m learnin’ it these days
Oh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh
In somebody’s room
It’s a price I have to pay
You’re a big girl all the way

A change in the weather is known to be extreme
But what’s the sense of changing horses in midstream?
I’m going out of my mind, oh, oh
With a pain that stops and starts
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Ever since we’ve been apart
I once held her in my arms
She said she would always stay
But I was cruel
I treated her like a fool
I threw it all away

Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
And rivers that ran through ev’ry day
I must have been mad
I never knew what I had
Until I threw it all away

Love is all there is, it makes the world go ’round
Love and only love, it can’t be denied
No matter what you think about it
You just won’t be able to do without it
Take a tip from one who’s tried

So if you find someone that gives you all of her love
Take it to your heart, don’t let it stray
For one thing that’s certain
You will surely be a-hurtin’
If you throw it all away
Someone’s got it in for me, they’re planting stories in the press
Whoever it is I wish they’d cut it out but when they will I can only guess
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me
I can’t help it if I’m lucky

People see me all the time and they just can’t remember how to act
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts
Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at
I couldn’t believe after all these years, you didn’t know me better than that
Sweet lady

Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth
Blowing down the backroads headin’ south
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
You’re an idiot, babe
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe

I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike
I haven’t known peace and quiet for so long I can’t remember what it’s like
There’s a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin’ out of a boxcar door
You didn’t know it, you didn’t think it could be done, in the final end he won the wars
After losin’ every battle
I woke up on the roadside, daydreamin’ ’bout the way things sometimes are
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin’ me see stars
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies
One day you’ll be in the ditch, flies buzzin’ around your eyes
Blood on your saddle

Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb
Blowing through the curtains in your room
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
You’re an idiot, babe
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe

It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart
You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn’t enough to change my heart
Now everything’s a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped
What’s good is bad, what’s bad is good, you’ll find out when you reach the top
You’re on the bottom

I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind
I can’t remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes
Don’t look into mine
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the
Building burned
I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the
Springtime turned
Slowly into Autumn
Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
You’re an idiot, babe
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe

I can’t feel you anymore, I can’t even touch the books you’ve read
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishin’ I was somebody else instead
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
And all your ragin’ glory

I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I’m finally free
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me
You’ll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above
And I’ll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love
And it makes me feel so sorry

Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats
Blowing through the letters that we wrote
Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves
We’re idiots, babe
It’s a wonder we can even feed ourselves

[Verse 1]
You got me some kind of way (Mmm-mmm)
Ain't used to feelin' this way (Mmm-mmm)
I do not know what to say (Yeah, yeah)
But I know I shouldn't think about it
Took one freakin' look at your face (Mmm-mmm)
Now I wanna know how you taste (Mmm-mmm)
I usually don't give it away (Yeah, yeah)
But you know I'm out here thinkin' 'bout it

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I realize she's right there
And I'm at home like, "Damn, this ain't fair"

[Chorus]
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
'Cause I'm bored
You can hit it in the mornin' (Mornin')
Like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care (Care)
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
'Cause I'm bored

[Verse 2]
This stuff always happens to me (Mmm-mmm)
Why can't we just play for keeps? (Mmm-mmm)
I'm practically on my knees (Yeah, yeah)
But I know I shouldn't think about it
You know what you're doin' to me
You're singin' my songs in the streets, yeah
Actin' all innocent, please (Yeah, yeah)
When I know you out here thinkin' 'bout it

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you realize she's right there
And you're at home like, "Damn, she can't compare"

[Chorus]
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
'Cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin' (Mornin')
Like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care (Care)
Break up with your girlfriend
'Cause I'm bored

[Bridge]
Hatin' if you want to
But I only hate on her 'cause I want you
Say I'm trippin' if you feel like
But you without me ain't right
You can call me crazy 'cause I want you
When I never even really freakin' met you
You can say I'm trippin' and it ain't right
But you without me ain't nice (Ain't nice)

[Chorus]
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
'Cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin' (Mornin')
Like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care (Care)
Break up with your girlfriend (With your girlfriend)
'Cause I'm bored

[Outro]
With your girlfriend, girlfriend
With your girlfriend, girlfriend (Girlfriend)
With your girlfriend

So many things I shouldn't do
I hate myself for hurting you
Honestly, I'm reckless
I'm sorry if I'm selfish

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Every time you get too close I run, I run away
And every time you say the words I don't know what to say
Back, back to the beginning
Really wish that I could change

Every time I fuck it up

Diamonds on my Rollie, never tickin' on my flesh
Rock a crop top, and my nipple showin' through the mesh
'Cause I'm winning
And my whole team living
And I be all up in the bank
Like my boy be in women, how you feeling?
How you feeling, how you feeling?

Oh, I
Love the way that you look me in my eyes

[Intro}
I woke up this morning looked at my bank account and had a heart attack

[Verse 1]
Move quickly, thinkin Soulja Tell 'Em
Leave him leaking if he disrespect the deacon
The beepers bleeping, yinking
Thinking to myself what is going on
Inside my head sipping syrup out my styrofoam
Now I think I need to get a chiropract
Because I’m getting so much money
And the weight is on my shoulders
And I'm harder than a boulder
And the world I'm taking over
And I’m luckier than a clover
Throwing on my J's as I start my day
Lighting up my blunt today
Bank account is looking straight
So damn, why them people hate?
But they can't relate to me
Everything's a common struggle
Everybody know what's up
Soulja Tell 'Em they in trouble
All my niggas know I'm king
All you bitch-ass niggas queens
Four way hit your fucking dream
Seeing shit you never seen
Going where you never saw
I'm thinking what you never thought
I’m buying what you never bought
I’m on and you always off
Off the fucking dome
Soulja I'm the fucking man
I’m riding on my chrome
Inside my home electric yong yeah
Kicking in my door never happened
I should mackingmidt
The fucking rachet make shit splatter
Soulja Tell 'Em it's disaster
Hit the mic and pick it up
I talk, my people lift them up
My words are powerful, so positive

[Sample]
He's never going to stop being The Juice

[Verse 1]
Yeah, they told me, "Don't make a promise you can't keep
All the drugs in your system, you can't sleep
How many times you had to buy a Plan B
For a girl you never bring back home to meet your family?", man
Man, I swear it's what I dream about
Ever since my mom told me that she need me out
Always smokin' weed, causin' trouble, never clean the house
But I paid her back for everything; I guess we even now
Nothin' better than some head after a long day
That's the only thing that ever keep mine on straight
And she asked me, "Why the long face?"
How I spent three-hundred-fifty dollars on this entrée
I drown my sorrow in that bottle
Today is full of regret, find forever in tomorrow
Man up, what's the problem?
Everything is Jazz and I'm Stockton (Haha)

[Chorus]
Yeah
I know it seem a little bit strange sometimes
Yeah, yeah
Everybody live a little, everybody die
Yeah, yeah
But that's life
Whatchu gonna do?
That's life
Baby, I would spend it all witchu

[Verse 2]
Yeah, and I'm headed to the
Other side, where the grass is always greener
And your bitch is down to ride, but that ass is always meaner
See, my cash got deeper and my morals disappeared
Never thought I'd be a asshole, this my last show
Can I please get a standin' ovation?
A hundred naked bitches in my dressin' room waitin'
We lost a lot of blood for this fucked up nation
But me, I'm gettin' high, makin' love in that spaceship
So what are the basics? Tell me your problems
You losin' your job or, even worse, you don't got one
So hard to stay sober when you feelin' fucked over so much
Always comin' up short, you like the roach of a blunt, yeah
And I could never sleep at night
Fuck payin' bills, I need a brand new lease on life
Why does doin' wrong always feel so right?
Well, I guess, fuck it, that's life

[Chorus]
Yeah
I know it seem a little bit strange sometimes
Yeah, yeah
Everybody live a little, everybody die
Yeah, yeah
But that's life
Whatchu gonna do?
That's life
Baby, I would spend it all witchu

[Outro]
Yeah
Say you runnin' out of time
That's life, babe, that's life, babe, yeah
The wrong things on your mind
That's life, babe, that's life, babe, yeah
Said your heart been broken
That's life, babe, that's life, babe
Just pick it up and keep goin'
It's alright, babe, it's alright, babe

Her hair was shorter than mine

I first saw her in a gay bar (gay bar)
Kissing another girl
I said, baby, I’m looking for a turn on
And she said, welcome to my world
Welcome to my world

Vagina was half-boy, half-girl
She taught me how to dance
Used to do it, used to do it with the TV on
Political romance

[Chorus]
Half-boy, half-girl
Best of both worlds
Half-boy, half-girl
Best of both worlds

Vagina was half-boy, half-girl

Can't quite understand it, don't know what to say
Looking around like a Roman scout
I know it's your love baby, turn it all about

You got me reachin' out
Everyday, baby
Baby got me reachin' baby, reachin' out

I'm in the dark and I can't see
Your love, baby, has blindfold me
Holding out my hand because the lights are out
Now walk up closer, baby, feeling all about

You got me reachin' every day now
You got me reachin' in the morning
You got me reachin', baby
Reachin', reachin'
Reachin', reachin'
Reachin', reachin'
Reachin' for you baby

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm a hard-working boy
'Cause my mama didn't raise no fools
She told me go out and get a job, yeah
As soon as I got out of school

She told me how to catch and hold a woman
Before she told me 'bout the birds and bees
She said, "baby, oh, money don't grow on
Money don't, money don't, money don't grow on trees"

[Chorus]
Money don't, money don't grow on trees, yeah
(Grow on trees) Yeah, darling
Money don't, money don't grow on trees
(Grow on trees)

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm a hard-working boy
It's the only way to stay alive
You can't get anywhere daydreaming (daydreaming)
So you better get a 9 to 5
Unless you can dance like Fred Astaire
You better think about a college degree
'Cause baby, baby, money don't (money don't)
Money don't, money don't, money don't grow on trees

[Chorus]
Money don't, money don't grow on trees
(Don't grow on trees) Ah, listen to me now, yeah
Money don't, money don't grow on trees, yeah
(Don't grow on trees) Listen to me now

[Bridge]
We do what we do (we do what we do)
My mama didn't raise no fool (mama didn't raise no fool)
You can't dance like Fred Astaire (dance like Fred Astaire)
Better get on the street
Everybody up, get up and move your feet, yeah

[Chorus]
Money don't, money don't grow on trees
(Don't grow on trees) Ah, listen to me now
Money don't, money don't grow on trees, yeah
(Don't grow on trees) Oh, break it down one time

I need my money (he needs his money)
Like a hog needs slop (What you say, brother?)
Baby, baby, I need my money
Don't, wanna stop, oh no
I love making money, money, money, money, money, money
Hey, yeah, ooh
Money, money, money, money, money, money, oh
If you can't do like Fred Astaire
Best think about a college degree
Look, baby (baby), honey (honey)
Money (money), money (money)
Money don't grow on trees

[Chorus]
Money don't, money don't grow on trees

Money don't, money don't grow on trees (don't grow on trees)
Money don't, money don't grow on trees (don't grow on trees)
Money don't, money don't grow on trees (don't grow on trees)
Money don't, money don't grow on trees (don't grow on trees)

Money don't, yeah

[Intro]
Whenever you're ready...

[Verse 1]
I keep your picture beside my bed
I still remember everything you said
I always thought our love was so right, I guess I was wrong
I always thought you'd be by my side, tonight you're gone

[Chorus]
What I wanna know, baby
If what we had was good
How come you don't call me anymore?
Yeah

[Verse 2]
(Let me tell you something, listen...)
I still light the fire on a rainy night

Rearrange your mind
Man, you've got to be drunk
You think we'd stoop so low

Rearrange your mind
Loosen up your hair
You gotta do things in a different way
If you wanna get anywhere (Dig it)

[Chorus]
People today won't change
Got to rearrange
Kids today want love
The kind we're dreaming of
Your music won't make me dance
I won't give it half a chance
People today won't change
Re-e-e-arrange

[Verse 2]
Rearrange your brain
Dial a brand new number
Just can't stay the same
Ain't nothing funky 'bout a waltz or rumba

Rearrange your brain
Got to free your mind
Your hair, your clothes, your body, your soul
Won't be far behind (Sing it)

[Chorus]
People today won't change
Got to rearrange
Kids today want love
The kind we're dreaming of
Your music won't make me dance

That you could use a date tonight
A body that'll do you right

[Spoken Interlude]
Good evening, this is your pilot Prince speaking
You are flying aboard the Seduction 747
And this plane is fully equipped with anything your body desires
If for any reason there is a loss in cabin pressure
I will automatically drop down to apply more
To activate the flow of excitement
Extinguish all clothing materials and pull your body close
Place my lips over your mouth, and kiss normally
In the event there is overexcitement
Your seat cushion may be used as a flotation device
We ask that you please observe the "No Letting Go" sign
I anticipate a few turbulence along the way
Yeah, yeah
We are now making our final approach into Satisfaction
Bring your lips, your arms, your hips into the upped and locked position
Yeah, yeah
Welcome to Satisfaction
Please remain awake until the aircraft has come to a complete stop
Thank you for flying Morris International
Don't touch the cymbals
The next time you fly, fly the International Lover

[Spoken Outro]
Give me a nice ending right here
Touch the cymbals a little bit, you know
Fiddle around a little bit
Did you like that?
Want to do it again?

The sky's another shade of blue
Whenever you go outside
I bet it never rains on you
You're beauty personified

[Chorus]

But you're as sweet as they come
Money never comes in handy
'Cause I can never buy half the fun I get
When I'm with you baby

[Verse 2]
Ever since the day I kissed you
It's always been on my mind

Must be something in the water they drink
Why else would a woman want to treat a man so bad?

[Verse 2]
People think I'm kind of smart
Why must a fellow stop with you before he starts?
Do not compute
I'll buy you clothing, buy you fancy cars
But you got to talk to me, baby, tell me who you really are

No matter the distance, our journies to Mars
We'll never just give up what's in our hearts
I'll let down my guard, love's in my heart

[Chorus]
This is too easy 'cause I'm waiting right here
Gotta be a reason for you and I
It's like I'm floating in space and I done caught me a star
Infinity, and all these light-years
And centuries, together with you and I
Why'd you pick me? It's like I'm trapped in a dream

[Verse 2]
Ages ago
Yeah, never would have crossed my frame of mind
I needed a sign
Towards the radio
And every time I turn it up, your song would play
See how love has its ways

[Pre-Chorus]
Together forever and ever, we're never apart
No matter the distance, our journies to Mars
We'll never just give up what's in our hearts
I'll let down my guard, love's in my heart

[Chorus]
This is too easy 'cause I'm waiting right here
Gotta be a reason for you and I
It's like I'm floating in space and I done caught me a star
Infinity, and all these light-years
And centuries, together with you and I (I)
Why'd you pick me? It's like I'm trapped in a dream

[Bridge]
Let's jump in my pickup and hot tail outta here, oh (Here, here, here)
Girl, it's me and you, just follow my lead (My lead)
We can make it no matter how hard it is, yeah (How hard)
I love you (Love you)
I love you, ooh

[Chorus]
This is too easy 'cause I'm waiting right here (Hey)
Gotta be a reason for you and I
It's like I'm floating in space and I done caught me a star
Infinity, and all these light-years (Oh)
And centuries, together with you and I (I)
Why'd you pick me? It's like I'm trapped in a dream

[Outro]
Trapped in a dream
I'm trapped in a dream
Dream, dream
Dream, dream

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I'm not your enemy, but you keep pressing me
So I'ma have to give you what you want, want right now
And we never been friends, but the thing between me and your man
We gon' keep between us, uh-huh
Don't act like you already know
You comin' home late, you stayin' all night with me
You should say "bye-bye" tonight
'Cause this gon' be your last time tonight, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
I see you lookin' like the one to say somethin', say somethin'
Mouth open but you don't say nothin', no
'Cause you be with her puttin', puttin' on, frontin' like you ain't did nothin'
You don't want her, you should let her go
'Cause you got some nerve bringin' her 'round me
Gotta keep my cool so nobody walks in
If she knew what she was doin' like I know, then that'd make her crazy
Is that really what you wantin', baby?

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If your girl only knew, knew, k-k-k-k-knew
That you been dealin' with me (Me)
And you been trickin' on me (Me)

In your business 'cause I'm spendin' my time with your guy
And it don't matter if it wrong or right, oh-whoa

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]
I'm not your enemy, but you keep pressing me
So I'ma have to give you what you want, want right now
And if anything, you should really be talkin' to your man before he's long gone
But he's already gone, my picture in his phone
Textin' me with all them X and Os
You should say "bye-bye" tonight
It's gon' be your last time tonight, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
I see you lookin' like the one to say somethin', say somethin'
Mouth open but you don't say nothin', no
'Cause you be with her puttin', puttin' on, frontin' like you ain't did nothin'

'Cause you got some nerve bringin' her 'round me
Gotta keep my cool so nobody walks in

Is that really what you wantin', baby?

[Chorus: Chris Brown]

[Verse]
You should get a tattoo that says, "Hold on"
Doesn't mean if I'm down or no
I wouldn't even mind seeing my before
Hope mine ain't dirtyin' this, oh babe
Ain't for the snitching, girl
But you can go and give me your way
Said I'll do the time for you
They gon' have to lock me down
Take the key and throw it away for you

[Chorus]
Girl, you got them thinkin' 'bout leavin' the country
I won't look back, on the run
I just need you to love me, oh, ayy
Just rest assure you're the one
I'll leave it all for your love

[Post-Chorus]
(For your love)
Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy
Starting to fall for your love
(For your love)
Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy
I'll break the law for your love
(For your love)
Win, lose or draw for
I'll lose it all for
I'll break the law for your love

[Verse 1]
Today's that special day
Gotta get on my way
Nine o'clock in the morning
Hope I'm not too late
'Cause I been thinking 'bout you
Words can not explain
Any price I'd pay for you
So I took the bus downtown
Traffic made me wait
I should get out now and try to run the rest of the way
You're all that matters to me
It would be a shame
If someone took my place today

[Chorus]
Oh please
Please don't leave before I get to you
I don't know what I would do without you
Oh, I, I might cry, cry, cry
I might cry

[Verse 2]
When I got there, so aligned
People all outside
Wrapped around the block now
I couldn't believe my eyes
But I've been thinking 'bout you
Words can not explain
Any price I'd pay for you
So I tried to cut the line
Security said, "Nice try"
Damn, they knocked my ass out
But I put up a fight
Just to feel your sole
Your tongue against my skin
Oh, I gotta find my way

[Chorus]
Oh please
Please don't leave before I get to you
I don't know what I would do without you
Oh, I, I might cry, cry, cry
I might cry

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Oh please
Please don't leave before I get to you
I don't know what I would do without you
Oh, I, I might cry, cry, cry
I might cry

[Verse 1]

Ah! At anytime I can flip
Off the rip, tell them monkeys hold the dip
Yeah, throw it off the ship

[Verse 1]
I would have never crossed that line (That line)
If I knew one kiss would change our lives, oh girl
You can't even look me in my face (My face)
You just wanna walk away (Yeah, yeah)
And act like it never happened, oh no
And you don't wanna mess up a good thing (Good thing)
Can't you see it? Girl, we got a good things (Good thing)
And right now, girl, I can't change the way I'm feeling

[Chorus]
You said that we should be friends
But girl, my heart can't take that
But I don't ever wanna see you again
Think about the good times that we had
Inside of my chest is so numb
When I think about what we could have done
Girl, tell me what are you running from
No one could ever love you like I do

[Verse 2]
I remember all the stories you told me (Oh, you told me)
And all them lames that you used to date
You know it's not me (Not me)
And all them rainy days I held you in my arms
While you cried (Cried), cried (Cried), cried (Cried)
I was always the one there for you
I guess I fell for you too deep (Oh!)
And i can't believe you saying this to me (Ow!)
You think we should we...

[Chorus]
You said that we should be friends (We should be)
But girl, my heart can't take that (Oh no)
But I don't ever wanna see you again (Don't wanna see you)
Think about the good times that we had (That we had, baby, yeah)
Inside of my chest is so numb (So numb)
When I think about what we could have done (We could've become)
Girl, tell me what are you running from (Oh)
No one could ever love you like I do

[Bridge]
All this love I have for you (All this love)
Girl, you're more than just a friend
I wish that I could change the past but I can't (Can't)
Now I gotta walk away (Gotta walk away)
'Cause I can't deal with this pain (Pain)
'Cause girl, you said that we should just be friends

[Chorus]
You said that we should be friends (We should)
But girl, my heart can't take that (Take that)
But I don't ever wanna see you again
Think about the good times that we had
Inside of my chest is so numb (So numb)
When I think about what we could have done (Oh-oh)
Girl, tell me what are you running from
No one could ever love you like I do
You said that we should be friends (We should just be friends)
But girl, my heart can't take that (Take that, yeah)

No one could ever love you like I do

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yesterday my lil' brother caught a murder case
Had to, he didn't wanna throw his life away
Judge hit him with 20, told him, "Get out my face"
He said, "You dead, boy, too late to pray, boy"
Shot bullet holes through his sphere, God
Send him up like here, God
Smear bloody tears, drip like syrup, sippin' Smirnoff
Life of a crime boss, life in jail, that's time off
This right here that mob talk, run it here
Bye, dawg

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
30 clip, that's a dick, you get fucked with it
Throw away after you use it, swimmin' with the fishes (Ha)
Don't tell yo' bid'ness, go on missions and don't leave no witness (No)
All these bitches turn to snitches, coppas come and getcha (Ooh)
Boy, them bullets hot, shoot you on the drop, you and yo' thot
Smokin' dreadlocks, headshot got that red dot
A million for my watch, said you got it? Bitch, I think not
Hop up at your spot, all these goons, don't get scared now
Fuck about a opp, bitch, I'm everywhere
If the niggas get to shootin', you gon' run and tell
I'ma catch a body 'fore a nigga get mine
Just because you pussy, watch a nigga get time
We all know that you the type to really switch sides
Runners from a youth, grind, gotta get mine
He did anythin' just to get on
But I'ma tell his mama, "He ain't comin' home"

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yesterday my lil' brother caught a murder case
Had to, he didn't wanna throw his life away
Judge hit him with 20, told him, "Get out my face"
He said, "You dead, boy, too late to pray, boy"

Send him up like here, God
Smear bloody tears, drip like syrup, sippin' Smirnoff
Life of a crime boss, life in jail, that's time off
This right here that mob talk, run it here
Bye, dawg

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
Killas at yo' crib drinkin' coffee like they work late (Sit on 'em)
Tryna squash it, niggas shouldn't have played with me in the first place (Fuck y'all niggas)
I'ma make your death day (Ha)
Nigga, fuck your birthday (Ha)
Kill that pussy bitch and shoot whoever got his shirt made (Brrrr)
I be solo when I ride (I'm 'bout to go get on these niggas)
Not shootin' from a distance, I'ma run up, catch these shots (Bop, bop, bop, bop)
If he a MAC with no kick, niggas die (Brrrr)
Spray the crowd, hollows ain't got names, they just flyin' (Brrrr)
I be in the shooter, with my hunters, 50 in my Ruger
Put a new drum on my glizzy, now that bitch sound like a Uzi
Shoot yo' momma house, now move her
Pulled a mission out this Uber
Me and lil' bro caught a body, ain't get caught, so we ain't do it, hol' up (Shh)
The opps on Instagram live (Them niggas live)
Let's go flip a nigga crib inside out
These bullets go through bricks, I shake yo' hand, you make it out (You cold)
Two clips taped together, it look like it's upside down (Ha)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yesterday my lil' brother caught a murder case
Had to, he didn't wanna throw his life away
Judge hit him with 20, told him, "Get out my face"

Send him up like here, God
Smear bloody tears, drip like syrup, sippin' Smirnoff
Life of a crime boss, life in jail, that's time off

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
This about love or hate
Lately I'm losin' faith
Don't know what happened, there's some distractions that I need to erase
I need to choose the pace
Brother we raise the stakes
Niggas be thinking they makin' a move but they dumb they ain't movin' a place
Don't think I can't be replaced
Probably gon' make a mistake
Missin' the simpler days when no one was around and no one could betray
I throw a gram on a tray
Put all my problems away
I'm sorry, mama, I'm sorry, papa
I told you I step and they want me decayed
Propaganda on display
Leaving rentals in the states
I ain't tryin' to debate, niggas dyin' out and they know I'm right
When they call we generate
Baby calm down, hesitate
They can try to make a plan for me, man, I'ma have to deviate
We be stressin' but ya make
That's when they collaborate
Tryna take away my peace of mind, lost some piece of minds to the state
Nigga I can't take a break
Mental on the dire straits
I'm the greatest still a waste
I just gotta concentrate

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Blow hunnids, loneliness isn't new to me
We dunnit, this is not a murder mystery
McDonald's, I was broke, in paradise
I spill Capri-Sun when she said the price
Fuck me right, masturbatin' to my Insta likes
Rappers turnin' boys, boy band turnin' into zeitgeist
Follow me rights, wanna be famous, piracy the price
Merlyn walkin' to you across the screen, like it's redlights
They gettin' all my teams, tell us 'bout that action
I need a white-man Mercedes, I'm a champion
Fifty-six, the browns, two floors, one roof attached
That's why we tighter than her bacon pack
D'USSÉ, makin' hella lo mein
You don't even understand what I'm sayin'
But you just bop your heads and fuckin' listen
Give us a name, give us something, fuck it, give me

[Chorus]
You don't want no problems with me
You don't want no problems with me
You don't want no problems with me
You don't want no problems with me
Let's do it peacefully
I'm 'bout peace so, we should do it peacefully
I'm 'bout peace so, we should do it peacefully
I'm 'bout peace so, we should do it peacefully
I'm 'bout peace so, we should do it peacefully (You don't want no problems with me)
You see me?

[Open Verse]

[Chorus]
You don't want no problems with me
You don't want no problems with me
You don't want no problems with me
You don't want no problems with me
Let's do it peacefully
I'm 'bout peace so, we should do it peacefully
I'm 'bout peace so, we should do it peacefully
I'm 'bout peace so, we should do it peacefully
I'm 'bout peace so, we should do it peacefully (You don't want no problems with me)
You see me?

[Verse 1]
Girl, you said you love me loud
I'm listening, make me proud
Girl, make me bow
I want to feel all your love in my chest
Bang it out
So turn it up, shake the ground
'Til I can't walk, lock me down, knock me down
Your frequency screams at me
Wanna know how you soundin' surround

[Pre-Chorus]
Break this heat up
Girl, you know how much I need ya
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Wanna feel the walls just closin' in
Wanna feel the fire on the floor

Girl, you hit me now, now, now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
Break this heat up
Girl, you know how much I need ya

Wanna feel the walls just closin' in

Pass the ball 'cause I'ma play

She puts her hands to ceiling just to catch a star
So if you lookin' for me, I'll be at the bar
Buyin' drinks, round after round
She's like a sink, the bottle, she guzzles it down

[Verse 1]
Bought a ticket for a trip I wanted long ago
Staring deep into crying eyes
Said goodbye, stood in line, now I changed my mind
I used to run and never look behind

[Pre-Chorus]
But now, now I've got a love to leave
And now, not gonna walk away so easily

[Chorus]
I can't take that plane, I can't take that
I can't take that plane today
I can't take that plane, I can't take that plane

[Verse 2]
Plane lands short a man on the other side
Driver stands with a sign in faith
Checks his watch as he size up the time gone by
Two lonely pieces circle baggage claim

[Pre-Chorus]
But yeah, now I've got a love to leave
And yeah, don't you know it changes
Everything, everything

[Chorus]
I can't take that plane, I can't take that
I can't take that plane today
I can't take that plane, I can't take that plane

[Bridge]
No, I can't, I can't
I can't, I can't

I'm coming to getcha, I'm coming to getcha now
I'm coming to getcha, I'm coming to getcha now

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
I can't wait ’til I get you on the floor, good-lookin'
Going hot, so hot, just like an oven
And ow! Burned myself, but just had to touch it
And it's so so fine, and it’s all mine
Hey, baby, we don't mind all the watching (High)
‘Cause if they study close, real close
They might learn something
She ain't nothing but a little doozy when she does it
She's so fire tonight

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things (Show you a few things)
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things (Show you a few things)
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
Now we're in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love, hey

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Stop, let me get a good look at it
Ooh, so thick, now I know why they call it a fatty
And ow!
It’s so sick got a hit and picked up a habit
That’s alright, ‘cause you're all mine (You’re all mine)
Go on and show 'em who you call daddy
I guess they're just mad
‘Cause, girl, they wish they had it
Ooh, my killer, my Thriller, yeah, you're a classic
And you’re all mine, tonight

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things

Show you a few things about love
Now we're in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things

[Interlude: Justin Timberlake]
Get out your seat, Hov!

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Uh!
All black at the white shows
White shoes at the black shows
Green card for the Cuban linx
Y'all sit back and enjoy the light show
Nothing exceeds like excess
Stoute got gout from having the best of the best
Is this what it's all about? I'm at the rest-
…aurant with my rant disturbing the guests
Years of distress, tears on the dress
Try to hide her face with some makeup sex
Uh!
This is truffle season
Tom Ford tuxedos for no reason
All Saints for my angel, Alexander Wang too
Ass-tight denim and some Dunks
I'll show you how to do this young, uh!
No papers, catch vapors
Get high, out Vegas
D'USSÉ's on doubles, ain't looking for trouble
You just got good genes so a tryna cuff you
Tell your mother that I love her ‘cause I love you
Tell your father we go farther as a couple
They ain't lose a daughter, got a son
I show you how to do this, huh! Uh

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things (Show you a few things)
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things (Show you a few things)
Let me show you a few things (A few things)
Show you a few things about love, love, love
Let me show you a few things (A few things)
Show you a few things about love, hey
Oh!

[Verse 1]
Aren't you somethin' to admire?
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the past
I'm here tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong

[Chorus]
I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me (Oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh)
With anyone else beside me (Oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

[Verse 2]
Aren't you somethin', an original?
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the past
I'm here tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong

[Chorus]
I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me (Oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh)
With anyone else beside me (Oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

[Bridge]
Yesterday is history, oh
Tomorrow's a mystery, oh
I can see you lookin' back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now (You show me, baby)
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me (Oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh)
With anyone else beside me (Oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

[Post-Chorus]
Ohh (Oh oh, oh oh)

Uhh (Oh oh, oh oh)

[Intro]
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah

[Verse 1]
I usually love sleeping all alone
This time around bring your friend with you
But we ain't really going to sleep at all
You ain't gonna catch me with them sneak pictures, sneak pictures
In my city I'm a young god
That pussy kill be so vicious
My god white, he in my pocket
He get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous

[Hook]
She asked me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often

[Verse 2]
Infatuated by the fame status
She wanna ride inside the G-Class grey 'matic
I come around, she leave that nigga like he ain't matter
That girl been drinkin' all day, need =to change bladder
She's just happy that the crew's back in town
She 'bout to go downtown for a whole hour
If I had her, you can have her, man it don't matter
I'm never sour, I'm just smokin' somethin' much louder

[Hook]
She asked me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often

[Bridge]
Oooh, the sun's risin' up
The night's almost up
The night's almost done
But I see your eyes
You wanna go again
Girl, I'll go again
Girl, I'll go again

[Hook]
She asked me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often

[Outro]
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah

[Intro]
Yeah, look

[Chorus]
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like R's and V's and O's
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Chubbs through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at 'Chella
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones

[Verse 1]
Stay in big six-six with woes
Man start dissin' and doin' reposts
They do anything except road
Still can't see them after it snows
I don't have time for the wasteman jokes
Personal ting if I'm gettin' up close
Loyal to O 'cause I've taken a oath
Versace hotel and I'm takin' the robes
Seen 'em in person, I'm seein' a ghost
They told me relax 'cause they're takin' control
Take all that shit up with P and his bro
I wish you the best, let me know how it goes
Wanna be free and I wanna let go
We came around and you showed us the most
I know so much shit that I cannot expose
I keep it inside and I laugh on my own
Got all the tea and I'm hottin' it up
I need a shade mansion, a room's not enough
You're droppin' some shit but that shit was a bust
They got no direction, they're followin' us
I come from a city that they never touch
Your man is a goofy and he could get brushed
I can't name a rapper or girl that I trust
I dream about turnin' these yutes into dust

[Interlude]
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Yeah

[Chorus]
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like R's and V's and O's
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Roxx through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at Nobu
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones

[Verse 2]
Think you know me? That's not true
We got ties in West End too
She came over and she got slewed
Throwin' up six like man had flu
I got way too big off Views
Back to the basics, I won't lose
They wanna link when they got no chunes
They too worried 'bout sellin' out shoes
I don't give a fuck 'bout jeans and crep
Or goin' to Milan or goin' to the Met
I just wanna make these songs for the set
I just wanna load that and let that wet
I got so much tings in the stash
Fold up anyone, dun that clash
Got no sense like Jizzle and shh
Big and bad like leader and shh
Can't do love 'cause they get too attached
Phone get broke and whip get scratched
I'ma just take my knots in cash
They can never tie me down, that's facts
All that bark but we know he's a cat
I don't really like goin' tit for tat
I'ma just come like tat-tat-tat
I'ma just end that there, that's that

[Intro]
Mally (Mally Mally) Mall (Mall)

[Verse 1]
My lady be trippin' sometimes
I let her get away with it
'Cause she's so god damn fine
My baby love to argue
But I don't pay her no mind
I drop that wood on her
And get back on my grind

[Bridge]
She know what she doing
She know what she want
She know how to move me
And she know when she wrong
That's why we break up
Break up
Break up, only to
Make up
Make up
Make up
Why we fighting
We can do the night thing

[Chorus]
I got somebody
That I wanna let go
Wanna let go
But it's something 'bout that booty
That I can't let go
Can't let go
Said I got somebody
That I wanna let go
Wanna let go
But it's something 'bout that booty
That I can't say no
Can't say no
Can't say no
Oh no
Can't say no
Can't say no
Can't say no
Oh no
Can't say no
Can't say no
Can't say no
Oh no

[Verse 2]
I know why you never listen
Just want me to put you
In that position
Make you say
Oh no
And if you was ever missing
The thought of you being
With other niggas I be like
Oh no
If anything was to happen
You know I'd be the first
To take action
For you
'Cause you still got a hold
On me
Don't you

[Bridge]
She know what she doing
She know what she want
She know how to move me
And she know when she wrong
That's why we break up
Break up
Break up, only to
Make up
Make up
Make up
Why we fighting
We can do the night thing

[Chorus]
I got somebody
That I wanna let go
Wanna let go
But it's something 'bout that booty
That I can't let go
Can't let go
Said I got somebody
That I wanna let go
Wanna let go
But it's something 'bout that booty
That I can't say no
Can't say no
Can't say no
Oh no
Can't say no
Can't say no
Can't say no
Oh no
Can't say no
Can't say no
Can't say no
Oh no

Fell from a branch
Tossed from an avalanche
How can I tell you?
How can I explain?

I am a raft
Wide is the river
You wanna ride?

Sink, though, I might

[Intro: Puff Daddy & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Yeah, yeah
You ready, motherfucker? (You ready, motherfucker? Uh, uh)
We gon' kill your ass (Kill your ass)
I'm ready

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
As I grab the Glock, put it to your headpiece
One in the chamber, the safety is off release
Straight at your dome, holmes, I wanna see cabbage
Biggie Smalls the savage, doing your brain cells much damage (Uh)
Teflon is the material for the imperial
Mic ripper, girl stripper, the Henny sipper
I drop lyrics off and on like a light switch
Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drive the Q (Uh-huh)
45, Glocks and TECs are expected when I wreck shit
Respect is collected, so check it
I got techniques dripping out my butt cheeks
Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets, huh (Ha)
My shit is deep, deeper than my grave, G
I'm ready to die and nobody can save me
Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl
My life is played out like a Jheri curl, I'm ready to die

[Chorus]
Yes, I'm ready
Yes, I'm ready
Yes, I'm ready
So die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
As I sit back and look when I used to be a crook (Yeah)
Doing whatever it took from snatching chains to pocketbooks (Uh-huh)
A big bad motherfucker on the wrong road
I got some drugs, tried to get the avenue sewed
I want it all from the Rolexes to the Lexus
Getting paid is all I expected
My mother didn't give me what I want, what the fuck?
Now I've got a Glock making motherfuckers duck
Shit is real and hungry's how I feel
I rob and steal because that money got that whip appeal (Okay)
Kicking niggas down the steps just for rep
Any repercussion lead to niggas getting wet
The infrared's at your head real steady
You better grab your guns 'cause I'm ready

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
Yes, I'm ready
Yes, I'm ready
I'm ready to die
Yes, I'm ready
Nah, we ain't gonna kill your ass yet
So die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die
We gon' make you suffer

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
In a sec I throw the TEC to your fucking neck
Everybody hit the deck, Biggie 'bout to get some wreck (Yeah)
Quick to leave you in a coffin for slick talkin'
You better act like CeCe and keep on walkin'
When I hit ya, I split ya to the white meat
You swung a left, you swung a right, you fell to the concrete
Your face, my feet, they meet with stompin' (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I'm rippin' MCs from Tallahassee to Compton
Biggie Smalls on a higher plane, niggas say I'm strange
Deranged because I put the 12 gauge to your brain (That's right)
Make your shit splatter
Mix the blood like batter then my pocket gets fatter
After the hit, leave you on the street with your neck slit
Down your backbone to where your motherfucking shit drip (Woo)
The shit I kick, rippin' through the vest
Biggie Smalls passing any test, I'm ready to die

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
Yes, I'm ready
Yes, I'm ready
I'm ready
Yes, I'm ready
Time to go, we gon put you out your misery motherfucker
Niggas definitely know what time it is
Yes, I'm ready
The Notorious one in full effect for '93 (Yeah)
Yes, I'm ready
Uhh, uhh
Yes, I'm ready
So die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die
Suicidal, I'm ready
Yes, I'm ready
Uh
So die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die
Uh, uh, uh

[Outro: Puff Daddy & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Now I lay me down to sleep (Yeah)
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
'Cause I'm ready to die
I'm ready
I'm ready
All y'all motherfuckers come with me if you want to, haha
I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready
Biggie Smalls the biggest man
I'm ready
Rocking on and on in '93
Easy Mo Bee
Third Eye and the rest of the Bad Boy fam
I don't wanna see no crying at my funeral

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
So you wanna be hardcore?
With your hat to the back
Talkin' about the gats in ya raps
But I can't feel that hardcore appeal that you're screamin'
Maybe I'm dreamin' (I'm dreamin')
This ain't Christopher Williams
Still some MC's gotta feel one, caps I gotta peel some
To let niggas know (Let 'em know)
That if you fuck with big-and-heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who? Says me, the lyrical
Niggas sayin', "Biggie off the street, it's a miracle!"
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggas actin' shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill ya quicker
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smokin' funk by the boxes, packin' Glocks-es
It's natural to eat you niggas like chocolates
The funk, baby

[Chorus]
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk

[Verse 2]
All I want is bitches, big-booty bitches
Used to sell crack so I could stack my riches
Now I pack gats to stop all the snitches
From stayin' in my business, what is this?
Relentless approach to know if I'm broke or not
Just 'cause I joke and smoke a lot
Don't mean I don't tote the Glock
Sixteen shots for my niggas in the pen
Until we motherfuckin' meet again, huh
I'm doin' rhymes now, fuck the crimes now
Come on the Ave, I'm real hard to find now
'Cause I'm knee-deep in the beats
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the MAC-10 by the seats
For the jackers, the jealous-ass crackers in the—
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof
Hold your head 'cause when you hit the bricks
I got gin, mad blunts, and bitches suckin' dick
The funk, baby

[Chorus]
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk (Uh)
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk

[Verse 3]
So I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side
How I smoke funk, smack bitches on the backside
Bed-Stuy, the place where my head rests
Fifty-shot clip if a nigga wan' test
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya
High as a motherfuckin' helicopter
That's why I pack a nina, fuck a misdemeanor
Beatin' motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina
What's love got to do
When I'm rippin' all through your whole crew?
Strapped like Bamboo, but I don't sling guns
I got bags of funk and it's sellin' by the tons
Niggas wanna know how I live the mack life
Makin' money, smokin' mics like crack pipes
It's type simple and plain to maintain
I add a little funk to the brain
The funk, baby

[Chorus]
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
Funk, baby
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
'94, got in store, Junior M.A.F.I.A. in the motherfuckin' house
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
Mo Bee got beats
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
Bad Boy in full effect
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
Biggie Smalls, uh
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
The funk, baby, machine gun funk, baby
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
The funk, baby

[Outro]
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
All you hoes know who it is

Peace and love, uh

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish these
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches, and when they leave they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch and really don't know much about her
When you really should sleep with a choppa 'cause you gon' wake up and see me with some choppas

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I be with bitches that be with bitches that be with niggas with riches
I tell 'em, "Get him," they say, "Yes, daddy," and they don't care how we split it
And they so pretty, and their hair lengthy, he hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs, it's a stick-up, she scream like a victim
Now you feelin' so silly, I smoke color purple, I'm up in here feelin' like Celie (Ooh)
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say? Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (Ooh)
You can get snaked, you can get faked out by the bitch that you feelin'
'Cause you thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you tell her your business, she tell me your business, you tell that bitch what you feelin'
All of the beans you be spillin', to you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's
She know where you hide to tell me where it's hidden, she know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics, and meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with you
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains, we find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checkin', then your first thought is to start second guessin'
She say, "What's wrong?" He say, "Nothin', keep restin'," she say, "What's missin'?" "How you know somethin' missin'?"
He scratched his head, she say, "Get back in bed," then she gave him some head
Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say, "Ooh, daddy, ooh," woo
She say, "Ooh, daddy, ooh," yeah, she took off his pants and his shoes
He opened his eyes and saw that barrel goin' "boom," nigga, yeah

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches, and when they leave, they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches that's with the niggas we followin'
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind, and tell them hoes, "Don't be so obvious"
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell, she bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, "Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place," and if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She don't want love, she just want her share, she feed him lies with his silverware

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I know a bitch named Liz, this nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears, and then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people, and they already know him, and then I call Liz, and she say he comin' over
I say, "Good girl, just remember what I told you," she say, "Yes, daddy", I say, "Girl, you're a soldier"
So we're waitin' outside, we watched him pull up, and walk up to the door
And right before he knock, she open the door naked, they started French kissin', but he didn't see moi
She left it unlocked, they didn't make it to the room, so they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds, turn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him
Piss a nigga off, shoot him dead in his frown
"Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around, I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up,  Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down"
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her, she a good actress and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we after, if Liz call you daddy, we call her a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga, but think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga, and if you alone, she bankrupts you niggas
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga, she slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga
Then you wake up and see guns in your face, and Mona Lisa out of frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga, you fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
We take everything that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion, we have your attention
And now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga, you more terrified than a Fatter Joe, nigga
Don't be a pussy for pussy, my nigga, don't be a asshole over pantyhoes, nigga, quit playin'

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
She say, ooh, Daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ooh, no emotion, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup and a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter, four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh, probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it, make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree, sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi? Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby, then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing, I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy, Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy, bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me 'bout a motherfuckin' double-standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone, but you sucked this dick, that's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No) You fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick) (… lick me like a lollipop)
He on your fuckin' ringtone? Is that the shit that you do? Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews, I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder, forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma, daycare after school and she never did charge you
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up, you know what, I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin', goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress, I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy, I'm killin' myself

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
She say, ooh, Daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ooh, no emotion, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah

(Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Catch the wall girl, catch the wall girl

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
You got friends I ain't sure about
Motormouths talkin' 'bout what they ain't sure about
I vote em out, fuck them hoes, they a dark cloud
It's pourin' down and what she ain't tryna go through
We go around, damn, why we gotta turn down?
Learn how good dick'll turn your world around
Deserve a crown on my shit and a turban how
I put it down and the liquor make you run your mouth
You broke it down
And everything we spoke about, it won't get out
And even though I know you're down
You punkin' out
And after I get all the routes, I'm comin' down
That's why we always fallin' out, girl (Girl, girl)

[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
There's-there-there-there's something I want to tell you, tell you
There's something I think that you should know
I shouldn't really love you
Let's take it slow

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
Huh, you got a ass like whoa now, profound
But you tellin' me to slow down, oh wow
You don't say that when them hoes 'round
'Cause you want them hoes to know, huh
I found love and you co-found

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Why we gotta turn down a match made
In heaven never burn out, just ask the clouds
You got me playin' cat and mouse, what's that about?
Teach you how to love 'til you get a cap and gown
But you givin' me the runaround, honey child
"I love you" are strong words, I'm muscle bound
And you tell me to settle down, let's settle down
But before I put the peddle down, you let me down, girl

[Chorus: Janet Jackson & Lil Wayne]
There's-there-there-there's something I want to tell you, tell you (Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl)
There's something I think that you should know
I shouldn't really love you
Let's take it slow
Catch the wall girl, catch the wall girl

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
Huh, you got a ass like whoa now, poke out
But you tellin' me to slow down, oh wow
You don't say that when them hoes 'round
'Cause you want them hoes to know now
Make me tell them hoes no now

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
But we gotta slow down 'cause you hearin' that I ho around
Don't feed into it like a closed mouth
Make me put my soul out
Girl, you so cold, get your snowplowed
I got the spirit like a ghost town, spirit like a ghost town
This dope dick will have you doped out
My boxer draws' like a dope house
While you tryna hold out, I'm tryna fuck around the whole house
I'm so for real like a fold-out
Girl, girl, girl, girl

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Ooh, she on a handstand
Ooh, she on a handstand
Ooh, she on a handstand
Pop-pop, p-poppin' on a handstand
And then you
Catch the, catch the wall girl
You gotta catch the, catch the wall girl
She shake-shake that ass though
She gon' shake-shake that ass though
Ass like whoa now, so round
She tellin' me to slow down, oh wow
She don't say that when them hoes 'round
'Cause she want them hoes to know now
She just like to see them hoes pout
Why we gotta turn down? Wild out
I'm just tryna have a turned out, why not?
I don't know what she worrin' 'bout
Concerned 'bout, "I'ma let it all work out"
Girl

[Chorus: Janet Jackson & Lil Wayne]
There's-there-there-there's something I want to tell you, tell you
There's something I think that you should know
I shouldn't really love you
Let's take it slow
I'ma let it all work out, girl
There-there's something I want to tell you, tell you
There's something I think that you should know
I shouldn't really love you
Let's take it slow
I'ma let it all work out, girl
There-there's something I want to tell you, tell you
There's something I think that you should know
I shouldn't really love you
Let's take it slow
I'ma let it all work out, girl

[Verse 1]
Baby momma say I ain't shit
Make a nigga feel like shit
Talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, "Dear Life" shit
So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it
I just hope I die for a reason
They probably won't miss me 'till they need me
Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord
I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, "Dear Life" shit
Way too concerned to be conceited
I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord
Die tryna reach 'em
They care more about how much I leave 'em
Where'd I leave it?
I hope I leave more of an impression
And all of my blessings for my kids and Ms. Cita, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, "You're a son of a gun"
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, "I won't hesitate to fuck a young nigga up", Lord
My new bitch left me
She said she felt too disrespected
It made no sense to me
But not to the people closest to me
And that's why she left
My smile just left
Can't lie though, I tried though
I'll die tryin', that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasin' our dreams
Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I’ll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is
As it appears, oh shit
There go the tears, there go the drank
There go the pills, you know the drill
Sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird
He done died so many times but still here
Why am I here?

[Chorus]
Dear Life
What is my reason?
What am I here for? That's the question
Hmm, my children
That was easy, so easy, uh

[Verse 2]
Loved ones say I don't love 'em
Make a nigga feel like nothin'
A bitch said we never make love
Make a nigga feel like fuckin'
I just tell my kids, "Nothing's easy"
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Smokin' all this motherfuckin' weed
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
I can't deny it, you can't tame a lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string
I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but there's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real
The shit I'm talkin' way, way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
And I'm higher than a cable bill, lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns
I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tag, no mistakes, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice bath when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Mama told me, "Fuck the world and be so aggressive
Be so fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive
I don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious"
'Cause if we could buy time, every store would sell it
And I never leave my grind, that bitch so magnetic
I keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' a sober headache
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter

[Chorus]
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question
Hmm, my children
That was easy, so easy
Yeah

[Chorus: Sam Bruno]
Welcome to your name in lights
All the lighters in the sky
Yeah, you must be famous
This is how you live your life
Different city every night
Yeah, you must be famous, famous

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'ma get on the TV, mama, Pac voice
People point at me, say, "Oh my God"
They got a point
I take security everywhere, I be so paranoid
And gold diggers dig until they find oil
And I'm sittin' here reading what was written 'bout what I do, what I didn't
I ruined relationships before my image, but
All I ever wanted was everybody's attention
'Cause most people are nobody 'til somebody kill 'em
Lord knows that's the truth
So with that said
Rest in peace to every dead
Military troops
Shootouts versus photoshoots
I've been through both, I'm photogenic
I'm bulletproof, almost saw the finish line
Plenty times, rock and roll, live or die
Gettin' high as hell, they say time will tell
Well, I tell time to hush
I tell 'em to kiss my ass
They say, "Can you look this way? Can you look this way?"
Pictures flash, I must be famous

[Chorus: Sam Bruno & Lil Wayne]
Welcome to your name in lights (Woo)
All the lighters in the sky (I must be famous)
Yeah, you must be famous (Yeah, I'ma get on the TV momma)
This is how you live your life (Yeah)
Different city every night (I must be famous)
Yeah, you must be famous, famous, uh

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Rich and famous, it's better to be rich and famous
It's you and your lawyer, everybody else is a plaintiff
You know entertainment, sex, drugs and entertainment
You know miscellaneous, sex, drugs simultaneous
Party long and hard
And pray death is quick and painless
Livin' in the spotlight, twist the light bulb if it's blinking
You're never alone
And I don't motherfuckin' blame you
Can't talk to yourself, 'cause mama said don't talk to strangers
Relatives; ain't seen ya since the grass been greener
And your friends say you changed and they can't hear you jingle
You want Tina and Nancy, you get Nancy and Tina
Never question yourself, unless you ask, "Am I dreamin'?"
Fan mail and subpoenas, shake ya hand they don't clean 'em
Never forget they seen ya
You gas 'em up with that premium
And they say, "Look this way, look this way"
Pictures flash when they see ya
To put 'em in magazines
Then after that, the museum
You must be famous

[Chorus: Sam Bruno & Lil Wayne]
Welcome to your name in lights (Yeah)
All the lighters in the sky (You must be famous)
Yeah, you must be famous (I'ma get on the TV, mama)
This is how you live your life
Different city every night (I must be famous)
Yeah, you must be famous (Huh), famous

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
They gon' pray that your career, be short and sweet
But they wish they were in your shoes, take them off, walk on a beach
Superstars don't twinkle and we don't sleep
And you can't spell fame, without me
May your Hall of Fame speech be short and sweet
"Thank God, fuck fame, fuck the police"
'Cause superstars don't twinkle, superstars beam
I was your main man, 'til I went mainstream
Oh my God, I must be famous

[Chorus: Sam Bruno & Lil Wayne]
Welcome to your name in lights
All the lighters in the sky
Yeah, you must be famous (Oh my God, I must be famous, yeah)
This is how you live your life (Yeah)
Different city every night (Oh my God, I must be famous)
You must be famous (Yeah, I'ma get on the TV, mama), famous

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Kiss my motherfuckin' ass

[Refrain 1: Lil Wayne]
Man, fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
We done came this far, I'm so proud of my niggas
Every house I got came with a lounge for my niggas
I make mountain tops fall to the ground for my niggas
Hit your town with my niggas, shut it down with my niggas
We fucked the same bitch, that's a pound with my nigga
I'ma let my nigga shine, I'ma let my nigga shine
And if you ain't my nigga, you a cloud to a nigga

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Man, I'll cop a key before a plea my brother
Break it down and sell it just to feed my brother
Guerrilla warfare, bitch, I feel like King Kong
Got the world in my hands like a screaming white woman
Dad, why the fuck did you leave my mother?
Rich as a motherfucker, me and my mother
Can't trust her, can't trust her if she ain't my mother
Can't believe these hoes, can't believe it's not butter
Can't believe these niggas, can't believe they're 100
Can't believe the drugs pills, can't believe it's not cut
Can't believe it's real love, can't believe it's not lust
Love is blind, love is blind, with his eyes wide shut
I ain't lyin', you gon' get your bitch kidnapped
You don't answer the phone, you gon' get your bitch whacked
In exchange for yourself, you can get your bitch back
Love is blind, love is blind, 'cause my heart is pitch black
Think fast, blam back, bullets fast, Amtrak
Get your shit ramshacked, get my bitch man jacked
I'm too high to backtrack, it's too good to pass back
Shoutout to the weed man, never sold a bad pack
I'm just sticking to the code, I ain't tryna crack that
Actin' bad on these boys like a bitch with bad cramps
And somebody said "hell" and I caught a flashback
Of that one-man cell, then I had to snap back

[Refrain 2: Lil Wayne]
Like fuck that shit, my nigga, you around all your niggas, around all your niggas
With a Nubian queen, skin brown as the liqueur, brown as the liqueur
And the brand new machine coming down like a missile, coming down like a missile
Brand new machine gun, brrrrr stick em', brrrr stick em'

[Refrain 3: euro]
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
The money look so beautiful walking up the aisle to a nigga
Tryna figure how an empty background become a crowd full of niggas
And the bitch right next to me feel like she miles from a nigga, at least we all smile for the picture

[Verse 3: euro]
Them niggas that's been there, them niggas my niggas
I need 'em to bring me more rounds for my niggas
We up, I don't have to look down for my niggas
I paid dues, show the amounts to them niggas
She told me she'll only go down on her nigga
And then she looked up with a mouthful of niggas
Doubt that I'll ever be doubtful my nigga
My stamp on the game, send it out to them niggas
I wanna be like Lil Wayne when I grows up
Smile full of bling-bling when I blows up
I overtalked for what they did to the code crush
Fuck the man, now he owes us, fuck the man
Couldn't pass, had to come up with another plan
Couldn't ball 'cause I couldn't dribble with my other hand
Fuck the man, no really girl, fuck the man
I'm the man, I don't give a fuck about another man

[Outro: Lil Wayne & euro]
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
I'm the man, I don't give a fuck about another man
Brand new machine coming down like a missile, down like a missile
Brand new machine gun, brrrrr stick em', brrrr stick em'

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, uh

[Bridge]
She never say, "Never say, 'Never,'" yeah
She never wake up before 7 PM (Uh)
She never dressed for cold weather, uh
And she's mine, she's mine, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
She got the whole world in her panties, yeah
And she mean the world to me, I just don't know what that mean, oh, oh Lord
She got some first class pussy, she got some world class pussy
And she's mine, she's mine, she's mine, yeah

[Chorus]
And who gon' love her if I don't, if I don't
And who gon' fuck her when I don't, no you won't
I choose to fuck her how I want, when I want
She's mine, she's mine, she's mine, yeah

[Verse 2]
Sleeping ain't the same if I ain't sleeping with you, girl (Uh, yeah)
'Bout to drive myself crazy, u-turn after u-turn, oh
Looking at myself in the mirror like, "Nigga, you sure?" (Uh)
Baby got me all shook up and I'd rather be shaken not stirred
(Talk to 'em) I love her no matter what
I love her through thick and thin
I love the way her breath smells as soon as we wake up
I be like, "Ooh, give me kiss," yeah
And no matter what my friends try tell me
We were made to fall in love
And we will be together, any kind of weather
It's like that, it's like that

[Chorus]
And who gon' love her if I don't, if I don't
Who gon' fuck her if I don't, no you won't
I choose to fuck her how I want, all I want
'Cause she's mine, she's mine, she's mine, yeah

[Bridge]
She never say, "Never say, 'Never,'" yeah
She never wake up before 7 PM (Uh)
She never keep up with the weather, uh
And she's mine, she's mine, yeah, yeah, hol' up, hol' up

[Verse 3]
I fell from a cloud to her tongue
I fuck her so good, I got to bow when I'm done
She say all she wanna do is get wild and have fun
My hands in her panties, find a diamond in the rough
If they bottled her up, I'd be a lousy ass drunk
Tell her, "Rivers run deep, I'd rather jog than run though"
Tell her, "Swallow that pride, I ain't cutthroat"
Then she sit on the dick proud, like the front row
And we don't care about what you haters care about
So we don't hear about what you hating about
That's why we gon' move in a bigger ass house
With a whole bunch of rooms with no room for doubt
We got too much going on
Oh Lord, she ain't got no drawers on
But she decide if she wearin' em with a coin toss
Hold on, let me turn my phone off

[Chorus]
And who gon' love her (And who gon' love her) if I don't, if I don't
And who gon' fuck her (And who gon' fuck her) if I don't, no you won't (Nope)
I choose to love her (I choose to love her) how I want, all I want
'Cause she's mine, she's mine, she's mine, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
And who gon' love her (And who gon' love her) if I don't, if I don't
And who gon' fuck her (And who gon' fuck her) when I don't, no you won't
You used to love her and you won't, now you don't
'Cause she's mine, she's mine, she's mine, yeah

[Bridge]
She never say, "Never say, 'Never'"
She never wake up before 7 PM (Uh)
She never dress for the cold weather
And she's mine, she's mine, all mine, yeah

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Turn the music up

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, them hoes throwing pussy like hand grenades
Don’t let it blow up in your face slime
Had to buy my dick a barricade
And a motherfuckin' K9
We murk niggas in the day time when the birds chirpin' and the flowers bloomin'
Everybody got automatics like cockin' back is too time-consumin'
Bought my bitch her own business so she can stay the fuck out mine
But she know hoes, hoes ain’t nothin' but hoes, ain’t good for nothin' but a house fire
Got a .9 right by her panty line, she’ll blow you away like a dandelion
And before they cross me, they’ll nail me to it
And I'ma dance when it's hammer time
My insides fucked up, and it feels so good to be vandalized
And these bars is handlebars, 'cause when I spit, I handle mine
God made dirt and dirt don’t hurt, that’s a lie
Cause I come from that dirty-dirty, and I know pain like raps and rhymes, my nigga
Doing big things, big wings, dragonflies
If I don’t live to see tomorrow, all my kids got daddy's eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I hustle, hustle like the rent was due yesterday
Muscle car got more muscles than a heavyweight
Take these bitches breath away, resuscitate
And the weed I smoke is strong as pepper spray, that strong
Pussy walls I interior decorate
All the police ever say is stay behind the yellow tape
Put in over time, that’s why I get paid the big check
Tote a .45 'cause they ain’t make the .46 yet

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Got all my niggas with me, that’s a no brainer
Fuck around and you can get shot up, like a low angle
Old ass money, I been ballin’ my nigga
And I been stop wearing Versace
'Cause I was wearing Versace when Pac was wearin' Versace

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, real niggas say, "Woo woo"
And such and such kill such and such
The streets talkin', bullshit walks on crutches but it strut the strut
Niggas panic, button pressin', the end is coming, count your blessings
We livin' in the day and time, where the Ten Commandments are now suggestions
How depressin', how unpleasant, click-clack, pow intestines
Bad bitches in flower dresses with tight pussies, I found the crevice
High socks, and tie-dye shirts
My fashion statement is a run-on sentence
Pussy niggas still making me sick
Kill all them niggas, no more symptoms

[Verse 3: Flow with Lil Wayne]
I’m smokin' weed in my tool shack
I'm gettin' twisted like Allen wrenches
Bitch, come dance with the devil nigga like ballerinas in catechism
Got a AK with a shell-catcher
And I'll pistol whip ya 'til your head swell up
No Xanax, just coke and Henny
I had to kick that shit like 4/20
And I hit yo' ass with the SIG Sauer (Boom)
Had them put you back together like a jigsaw
And I'ma still bring that bacon home
I don't really give a fuck what the pigs thought
A pussy-ass rat, that's Tom and Jerry (Yeah)
I was gettin' fat off of commissary (Yeah)
And rest in peace to my nigga Soupy (Yeah)
I've been goin' in since Slime was buried (Suwoop)
And in jail, them snacks like bags of money
Just imagine what I had before a bag of cookies
A new deck of cards and a bag of coffee
Get you poked up dead in the shower, bloody
It's fucked up but it's safe to say
For the last seven months, I felt right at home (True)
And with the same pen that they stabbed you with
I'll wash that bitch off and go write a poem (Ugh)
Niggas sleepin' on me, had to shoot one time just to see who'd wake
I don't see your fate but I can see you fake
I gotta light my grass just to see you snakes
Bitch, life is a gamble
Pay up what you owe boy
No drive-bys like they did Ricky
I'm hoppin' out like Doe Boy
(Do-do-do-do-do)

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Hustle like the rent was due yesterday
Muscle car got more muscles than a heavyweight
On the edge, just one step away so step away
And the weed I smoke is strong as pepper spray, that strong
Pussy walls I interior decorate
All the police ever say is stay behind the yellow tape
Put it over time, that’s why I get paid that big check
Tote a .45 'cause they ain’t make a .46 yet

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Got all my niggas with me, that’s a no brainer, yeah
I got all my niggas with me, that’s a no brainer, yeah
Got all my niggas with me, that’s a no brainer, yeah
Blow your fuckin' brains out, that's a no brainer, hahaha

[Intro: Lil Wayne & Birdman]
80s and 90s money, boy
Money
Just ball, baby, just ball, baby
Ain't nothing to me
Money ain't never been nothing to me
You understand me?
Ain't nothing to me
Ain't nothing to me
Spend as much as you feel baby
I told the bitch it's just money

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & INOJ]
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Jesus saves, I spend it, nigga
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
I told the bitch it's just money
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Jesus saves, I spend it, nigga
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'm about to start using hundred dollar bills to twist a kill, that's for real
We've been on the road to riches, I told Stunna pass the wheel
Man, I just bought a painting for half a mill, that's a steal
Shit, when I'm an artist myself for crying out loud, that's a tear
In a backyard, where the dog at? Driveway where the hogs at?
Can't beat this shit, nigga, Lord knows I fought back, I fought back
We live nigga, let's broadcast, you caught that
New car get brought back if that motherfucker don't haul ass
I swear I had a Lexus coupe, it was Pepsi blue
It was shockingly gorgeous, it was electro-cute
I need a screw, the loose change extra loose
I just give my bitch some loot, that shit like pressing mute, fuck it

[Chorus: Lil Wayne, Birdman, Both & INOJ]
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Ain't nothing to me, money don't mean nothing to me
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Ain't nothing to me, money don't mean nothing to me
It ain't nothing to me
I told the bitch it's just money
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
You understand me, love? You can take this jet
I know you ain't been out your neighborhood
Jesus saves, I spend it, nigga
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
You understand me? We going to another country with this chopper, this is ballin'
Yeah
You understand me? Blow a quarter mill

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I'ma park my Royce on the grass at your bitch house
Talk that shit, I'm shit-mouth
I flip this money, baby
Watch that perfect dismount
I say thank God all my bills paid
Knock on wood, my mama good
Knock twice 'cause she gave me life
Don't forget that, your honor could
Man, niggas be jacking these days
Only thief I know is Robbin Hood
But I'll pay for that trial nigga
Gotta protect my lively-hood
Look at all the bullshit I've endured
My lawyer said I matured
Talking 'bout them dead presidents
Breath smell like embalming fluid

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Vacation, vacation
Keep the weed in rotation
Don't give up the location
I'll send you back to population
Man, I feel like making donations
And I don't need no standing ovations
I bought my bitch some new shit
And told her I don't care if you break it, it's just money

[Chorus: Lil Wayne, Birdman, Both & INOJ]
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Money don't matter
Money don't mean nothing to me
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
It ain't nothing to me, money don't mean nothing to me
It ain't nothing to me
I told the bitch it's just money
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
You understand me, baby girl? You don't have no worries no more when you fuckin' with this
Jesus saves, I spend it, nigga
Money's never a problem
It never really mattered too much to me, to me

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne with Birdman]
I got money to burn, fire hazards
Lil Tune the monsoon
Cash Money mascot, it's hot under this costume
Got rugs I never stepped on
Beds I never effed on
I'm in that upper echelon
Your empty pockets echoing
I still ride for my niggas
Money don't change a gangster
And when I'm asked to pull a few strings
I pull 'em until they untangle
And I like nice things and bad bitches with cab fare
More money, more problems
I'm surprised I still got black hair

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I feel like a vacation, vacation
We gon' need vaccination
Don't give up the destination
I'll send you back to population
Man, let's leave out our situations
Leave our tribulations
I got old money, generations
Where's my cheque book? I'm spending pages, it's just money

[Chorus: Lil Wayne, Birdman, Both & INOJ]
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Some niggas might call it trickin', we call it takin' care of your broad
Jesus saves, I spend it, nigga, yeah
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
I told the bitch it's just money
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
I swear to God we gon' ride high, and stay fly, and stay high
Yeah, yeah, yeah, money don't mean nothing to me
You understand me, baby?
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Ain't nothing, money don't mean nothing to me (Money, money)
It ain't nothing to me
Just ball, baby, just ball, baby

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Birdman]
It don't mean nothing
I already paid that price
Money don't mean nothing
We do this shit every night
Yoppas in the middle of the ocean
Helipads, chefs
You understand me?
Baby, we ain't even gotta go to the mall
The mall will come to us
Just the prize of the life

[Chorus]
Hush, hush, baby, you don't have to cry
I'm not sorry, but I lied
It feel a little bit better when you close your eyes, cl-close your eyes
Hush, hush, baby, you don't have to cry
I know you hate me 'cause I'm right
Just close your eyes, this is my
M-m-m-my lullaby-by-by-by-by

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
(Hush, hush)
Uh, I tell her I'm workin', I'm not with these hoes
Yeah, she say, "You better be workin' and not with these hoes" (Hush, hush)
I tell her what she wanna hear, not what she don't wanna know
She tell me, "Be quiet and ride me slow, like they got bumps in the road" (Hush, hush)
Look, what you don't know won't hurt your ass
Girl, 'cause if you knew better, you'd do better, yeah, whatever, shit (Hush, hush)
I tell you "I'm here" when I'm there and "I don't" when I do
And you just want me to tell all of the bitches I care for it's all about you

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And I get that, so when I'm with them, I just hit that
I don't even kiss back, my white lies are pitch black, believe that
And I ain't proud of myself, I can't lie to myself
I said, "Self, gather yourself," and left her cryin' by herself, whoa

[Chorus: (Lil Wayne)]
Hush, hush, baby, you don't have to cry
I'm not sorry, but I lied
It feel a bit better when you close your eyes, cl-close your eyes
Hush, hush, baby, you don't have to cry
I know you hate me 'cause I'm right
Just close your eyes, this is my (You met me this way, baby)
M-m-m-my lullaby

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
(Hush, hush)
Uh, I tell her, "Don't worry, it's not 'bout them hoes"
She just be hopin' whenever I'm worried, it's not  'bout them hoes (Hush, hush)
Uh, she act like my stories are not gettin' old
But I know she'd rather hear what I tell her, not what she not bein' told (Hush, hush)
Okay, I lied to you 'cause the truth hurts
And it hurts me too, I would cry with you but I gotta work, I gotta work (Hush, hush)
She say, "You better be workin' and not with these hoes"
But I drive 'em so crazy like I got the wheel on the wide-open road

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And I zig-zag, and when I'm with them, I just hit that
We don't even kickback, chit-chat, nor chillax, believe that
And I ain't proud of that shit, I can't lie about that shit
I say, "Self, snap out this shit," and left her crying 'bout that shit, woah

[Chorus]
Hush, hush, baby, you don't have to cry
I'm not sorry, but I lied
It feel a bit better when you close your eyes, cl-close your eyes
Hush, hush, baby, you don't have to cry
I know you hate me 'cause I'm right
Just close your eyes, this is my
M-m-m-my lullaby
LYRICS FROM SNIPPET

[Verse: Young Thug]
Like, get out my face and my place and my space 'fore I aim at your face and make copies, no paste
I pop a E, no bay, then I took off with no trace

[Hook: Lil Wayne & Young Thug]
Tunechi, tell these pussy niggas that you caught me grindin'
Tunechi, tell 'em that you grindin'

[Intro]
Ain't nobody like you in this bitch
Woo! Fuck them other niggas
Carter V! Fuck them other niggas
Ain't nobody else like you, ain't nobody else like you
Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch
You ready?

[Refrain 1]
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Ridin' in a mothafuckin' brand new machine, comin' down like a missile
Machine gun to a nigga spine like, "Listen, nigga listen, don't move, motherfucker"
And the world is mine like Twism, this that Carter V, lemme get 'em

[Verse]
I know the whole New Orleans got my back
Get the dirt off my shoulders and clean up my act
This that C5, thank you Jesus, I'm back
'Cause there's only one I, don't remove that eye patch
Man, I got this whole fuckin' world on my back
It wasn't my hands but there's blood on my hands
Watch my fingers make a capital B
I throw gang signs up and don't care where they land
I know the whole 17 got my back
The backbone of my hood, I'm the spleen of my trap
I know some niggas that think it's Iraq
There is death in the air, you might catch a contact
You may need to shorten the lean after that
Man, I swear I drunk so much of lean, I almost passed
Not tryna say I've been clean after that
But let's just say that is a thing of the past
But can you picture the scene after that?
No more Lil Tunechi, no more king of rap
Life can be gone in a blink of an eye
Lord, I guess I just be blinkin' too fast
Oh but don't you judge me, judge the one in the mirror
In your bathroom found a sink full of glass
Just when they thought and they think I wouldn't last
I woke up and I just Carter Cinco'd they ass

[Refrain 2]
Man, fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
We done came this far, I'm so proud of my niggas
I'm around for my niggas, I come...

KE on The Track

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I need the sun to deliver me from all these thoughts of mine
When everything else seems grey, you see colors
When life just seems to fly past, you just hover ooh
I'd go through hell just to see you smile
And to see you happy makes it all worthwhile
I know this feeling is love
And you are an angel sent from above, oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]
When I see your face, it takes my breath away
Another step to take
I wanna have your heart, your heart
I'm heading somewhere now, I'm leaving it up to fate
But that's just the risk I'll take
I wanna have your heart, your heart

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
For some time, I been  holding this in 'cause I
Knew that a day would come when you and me would feel something undefined
And for a long time, I been here waiting on you
There's something amazing 'bout you
And I think you are an angel
So when I...

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter, Chris Brown]
When I see your face, it takes my breath away (Yeah)
Another step to take (Another step to take)
I wanna have your heart (Your heart), your heart (Your heart)
I'm heading somewhere now (Yeah), I'm leaving it up to fate (I'm leaving it up to fate)
But that's just the risk I'll take (That's just the risk I'll take)
I wanna have your heart (Your heart), your heart (Your heart)

[Bridge: Chris Brown, Sevyn Streeter & Both]
(Ooh, ooh)
I know you are the one
(Ooh)
I know you gave me something incredible
Just lay your head right on my chest
(Ooh)
And you'll be safe right here with me for life
(Ooh)
And I'll never let you go
Spend the rest of my time, just you and I
When I...

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter, Chris Brown]
When I see your face, it takes my breath away
Another step to take (Yeah, another step to take)
I wanna have your heart (Ooh), your heart (Ooh)
I'm heading somewhere now (Yeah), I'm leaving it up to fate (I said I'm leaving it up)
But that's just the risk I'll take (That's just the risk I'll take)
I wanna have your heart, your heart

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Baby

[Verse 1]
I can dim the lights and sing you songs full of sad things
We can do the tango just for two
I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings
Be a valentino just for you

[Chorus]
Ooh, love
Ooh, lover boy - what'cha do'in tonight
Hey, boy
Set my alarm turn on my charm
That's because I'm a good old fashioned lover boy

[Verse 2]
Ooh let me feel your heart beat (grow faster, faster)
Ooh, can you feel my love heat?
Come on and sit on my hot seat of love and tell me "how do you feel right after all?"
I'd like for you and I to go romancing
Say the word, your wish is my command

[Chorus]
Ohh, love
Ohh, lover boy - what'cha do'in tonight
Hey, boy
Write my letter, feel much better
And use that fancy patter on the telephone, yeah

[Verse 3]
When I'm not with you, think of you always
I miss you
When I'm not with you, think of me always
I love you (love you)
Hey, boy, where'd you get it from?
Hey boy where did you go?
I learnt my passion in the good'ol fashioned school of lover boys

[Verse 4]
Dining at the Ritz we'll meet at 9, precisely
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 o'clock)
I will pay the bill, you taste the wine
Driving back in style in my Saloon will do quite nicely
Take me back to yours, that will be fine
Come on and get it

[Chorus]
Ohh, love
Ohh, lover boy - what'cha do'in tonight
Hey, boy
Everything's alright just hold on tight that's because I'm a good old (fashioned, fashioned)
Lover boy

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 1]
Yeah, started off right
I can see it in your eyes
I can tell that you're wantin' more
What's been on your mind?
There's no reason we should hide
Tell me somethin' I ain't heard before

[Refrain]
Oh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it
And it's you I'm on
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts (Yeah)
Can't get what we want without knowin' (No)
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 2]
Oh, nah
Penthouse view, left some flowers in the room
I'll make sure I leave the door unlocked
Now I'm on the way, swear I won't be late
I'll be there by five o'clock

[Refrain]
Oh, you've been dreamin' 'bout it
And I'm what you want
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? (Oh) Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
Seems you're not the girl you used to be
What is it, baby, have you
