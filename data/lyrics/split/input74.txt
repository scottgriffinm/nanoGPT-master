Jack's bride, he ain't no fight
And his wife would eat no leaf
Contrary to popular opinion
It was hard to keep something in-between
One day when Jack came home
He said, "Honey, you been kind-a mean."
She said, "I'm sorry, Jack. But it's time that I have to leave."

Please don't let me go
'Cause I feel so alone

You get out and criticize my diet
Even though you never ever tried it
There was a day when I wanted to have your babies
But as of lately, you haven't even laid me
We both sing songs things about saying we never did
But you don't appreciate my mood
This is not a fairy tale, and it's time that I gone away

Please don't let me go
'Cause I feel so alone
Please don't let me go
'Cause I feel so alone
We need food but

Watch the baby
Tangled in your hair
Crawling backwards
Pulling on your ear

Baby loves me
Flower in his hair
Say you've seen me
Yes I've seen him
Sally
I know you're gonna hate me
But I've been thinking bout that baby
And if you have it I'm gonna leave

You see I met this girl in high school
And she thinks that I'm cool
She says her boyfriend is a tool
And she's not afraid to break the rules

And I don't care about those people
Who try to tell me it's illegal
'Cause this girl is a beauty
And she told me I'm a cutie
And she said her daddy hits her
And he's had too much liquor
But you know that it's okay
'Cause she loves him anyway

I think that I love her
Even though I just met her
And if she gets to know me
I think that she will love me
And tomorrow I can break a day
I'm gonna take the subway
Right down to her place
And we're gonna run away
And we'll be a-okay
Yeah, we''ll be a-okay
Yeah we'll be a-okay
Yeah we'll be a-okay
HEY
I am an animal and
I got my animal friends
We go and eat our own shit
And then we go and make some new friends!

We're all bleeding on the inside
And we’re all cleaning on the inside
We're all bleeding on the inside
And we're all cleaning on the inside

Cause
I am an animal and
I got my animal friends
And we go and eat our own shit
And then we go and make some new friends!

And we won’t listen to anything you say
And we won't listen to anything you say
And we won't listen to anything you say
And we won't listen to anything you say
Cause
I am an animal and
I got my animal friends
And we go and eat our own shit
And then we go and do it again
And you don't
Understand
What you can hold
In your fucking hands

And I'm sorry
I'm so angry
All the time

Give me something
Right away
Because I can't wait
Another day

And it makes me
Kind of happy
To see your face

And I discovered that she's not really your mother
The booklet says that I'll be instantly discovered
And I just realized that I
Never should of loved her
I can't believe that I had
Caused all of this trouble

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you know you fine and you know I know

Take that, that’s yo money, aaah

[Verse 1]
I know you ain't come in here to make nothin’
I'm throwin' hundreds, this ain't up for no discussion
My whip is disrespectful, my bank account disgusting
My bitch is sick with it, my section look like a GoFundMe, yeah
I came up in here with my money in a brown bag
I’m not gon' let one of you bitches catch me down, bad
Me livin' out here with some money, that just sound bad
Can't take the bottle, then all my niggas are down mad
Fuck it, i on know why we rushin'
Drop the top on the dawn, and all it takes is a button
Bitches like "Oh my God, them niggas came up from nothin' "
And no it's not a facade, them niggas really be stuntin', yeah
If shawty comin', she suffer the repercussions
I keep a plug, and she never gon' need for nothin'
I love my bitches, you always gon' see me cuffin'
If you ain't throwin' money, go make some readjustments
I ain't playin'

[Chorus]
I know you ain't come here to make no money
Them niggas said they bought 'em, that's so funny
Now show me something new for this old money (buss it)
If I throw it at you, baby girl, that's yo money
That's yo money, that's yo money

You and me be on that same page
You packing on that form
Me and the wife be trynna do the same thing
Keep that liquor flowing, bitch its motherfucking game day
Listen only thing that we missing is bout a couple more bitches that can give me some assistance

[Verse 1]
Will I live and die in a band?
My consciousness controls my hand
She can't swim very well
(No, but you wouldn’t be able to tell)
Let's find something to watch, then watch our phones for half the time
When we go for food, you have yours and I'll have mine
It says, "Don’t take these pills if you've been drinking any wine"
Oh, these things, they have been playing on my mind
These things, they have been playing on my mind

[Verse 2]
I think I've seen the side of every road
They all lead somewhere, I've been told
Will I get divorced when I'm old?
(Oh, why am I always cold?)
And I met one of your friends, and it was dead nice
He was fine, but he said
"Things that interest me exist outside of space and time"
Now, I know I should've left it, but who says that? What a sigh
It all kicked off and it's been playing on my mind
The whole thing has been playing on my mind

[Verse 3]
I think it's strange that I still call you
When I’ve got nothing to say
The truth is that I still adore you
And nothing really matters anyway
But I won’t get clothes online 'cause I get worried about the fit
But that rule don’t apply concerning my relationships
See, I keep getting this stuff wrong, take me out, put me on
Oh, these things, they have been playing on my mind
The whole thing has been playing on my mind
Oh, it's all been just playing on my mind
Top to bottom
Now it's perfection
Now he (he he)
Fits my description
Swag delicion, most specticious
How he g-g-g-g-get them
And I want him (gotta have him)
Countdown baby, Imma get it

[Verse 1]
I just met infatuation
It's something in his smile
Now my obsession can’t stand the thoughts of you and I
Something takes over, pulls me up onto my feet
Before I know it, I got you pushing up on me

[Pre-Chorus]
On the floor
Under the burning lights
Stranger lurking behind
Hands on this waist of mine
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me

[Chorus]
Out here whipping my hair all crazy, baby
Doin’ it like I'm at work
I'm making that thang jerk
I'm making that thang twerk (So get up on it, baby)
I'm doin' what I do

Got me out here whipping my hair, ahh

[Verse 2]
Baby, I just might have what you need
Sprinkling you with pieces of me
Now let's make it a sight to see, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
On the floor
Under the burning lights
Stranger lurking behind
Hands on this waist of mine
And I don't know where this will lead
But I’m hoping you tell me

Out here whipping my hair all crazy, baby
Doin’ it like I'm at work

Got me out here whipping my hair, ahh

[Bridge]
We’re flashing pictures
Kodak moment memories
Look at the flickers
Sparks on my camera screen
The buried treasure
Come with me and we will find
Create a perfect world, just for you and I

[Pre-Chorus]
On the floor
Under the burning lights
Stranger lurking behind
Hands on this waist of mine
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me

[Chorus]
Out here whipping my hair all crazy, baby
Doin' it like I'm at work
I'm making that thang jerk

Baby, I just might have what you need
Sprinkling you with pieces of me
Now let's make it a sight to see, baby

But I'm hoping you tell me

Oh yeah

My girls came by
They sat me down
And they started telling me how
When you are gone
Your not at work
Said your with other women
Your such a jerk
I didn't want
To hear anymore
So I asked them to leave
And slammed the door
I didn't want to realize
My man was living a double life
I get the feeling that you don't give a shit
Your caught out there
And your not discreet with it
And everybody knows who I am
And you don't give a damn, ho!

But even more
I was ashamed to say your a whore
Cause I let you in
And I just knew
That there wasn't anyone else but you
And I used to brag
About how good
My man was but oh I never should
Cause everyone was just laughing at me
Cause they all knew what it was I couldn't see
I get the feeling that you don't give a shit
Your caught out there
And your not discreet with it
And everybody knows who I am
And you don't give a damn, ho!

I can't

And lie straight through your teeth?

You've been fooling around on me
I wish that you would've had
The guts to just tell me

Oh yeah

[Chorus]
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

[Verse 1]
When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that truck you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast, so I would notice you
But your heart's a mess, think you oughta know
Doesn't matter if you're balling out of control

[Pre-Chorus]
All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

[Chorus]
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't (Ooh)
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

[Verse 2]
When I took a chance thought you'd understand (You don't understand)
Baby, credit cards aren't romance
So you're trying to buy what's already yours
What I need from you is not available in stores
Seen a side of you (You) that I really feel (Feel)
Doing way too much (Much), never keep it real (Real)
If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road
Now I'm leaving, where's my keys? I've got to go

[Pre-Chorus]
All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

[Chorus]
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't (Baby)
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing (Love don't cost a thing)
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't (No)
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

[Bridge]
Love don't cost a thing, a thing, a thing
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You think the money that you make (That you make)
Can substitute the time you take (The time you take)
Take the keys here to my heart
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart (Don't cost a thing)
I think you need to take some time
To show me that your love is true (Ooh)
There's more than dollar signs in you
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart

[Chorus]
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing (Love don't cost a thing)
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke (Even if you were broke)
My love don't cost a thing (My love don't cost a thing)
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't

If I wanna floss, I got my own (If I wanna, don't)
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't (Think I wanna)
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't (If I want my own)
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't (Think I wanna)
If I wanna floss, I got my own (If I want my own)
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

[Chorus]

If I wanna floss, I got my own (If I want my own)
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

[Verse 1]
It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives we can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind (In my mind)
I'd live a thousand lives, each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less-than-perfect circumstance (Ooh)
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart?

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I think that a true love can never be (Never be)
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me (Ooh)
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about (You're about)
A deeper love I've found in you, and I no longer doubt (Ooh)
You've touched my heart, and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart?

[Bridge]
I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt
Held me back from what my life should be (Ooh)
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to be

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try?
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real (Oh, yeah)
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life  (Oh, yeah)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No, no)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart? (Oh, yeah)
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Funny)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Even if you try)
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Baby, ain't it funny?
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Change your life)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (Wrong or right)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Baby, ain't it funny?
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Can't deny)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Even though you try)
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Baby
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life?
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right?
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try?
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez & Fat Joe]
Now you've been holding me down, mmm
For such a long time now
From back then 'til now, in my story
Straight from the hood, you've always been there for me
And you had my back when they
Back when everybody said I wasn't anything
It was you who kept me holding on, no matter what was going on
So whatever you need, I got you, yeah (Yeah, uh, yeah)

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Reminiscin' that 6 train from way back
Now it's sky blue Phantoms and stretch Maybachs
From sweepin' them floors in them Bronx apartments, ha
"Mira, esta que on that red carpet"
When Pun died, you was the first to call me
I never told you but you was there for me
Whatever you need, I'll be there for you
Crack, I got your back for real, true story

Now my loyalty will always be with you

[Verse 5: Fat Joe]
Like green is to autumn, some things must stay
This industry, yeah, I fought 'em, made me this way
Get between me and J. Lo, I simply state
You're better off sweepin' leaves on a windy day, no

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez]
So I don't care about the situation
I'ma ride for you if there's a complication
'Cause every time you had my back and all
When we were young, now you Joey Crack and all

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Now my loyalty will always be (Now my loyalty will always be)

To go to a party, sit down and wait

And when I hear that beat, I get my body up out my seat
I grab a guy and move my feet
He's playing my song

Sitting here listening to you

[Verse 1]
Time goes slowly now in my life
Fear no more of what I'm not sure

[Pre-Chorus]
Searching to feel your soul
The strength to stand alone
The power of not knowing and letting go

[Chorus]
I guess I've found my way
It's simple when it's right
Feeling lucky just to be here, tonight
And happy just to be me
And be alive

[Verse 2]
Love in and out of my, my heart
And though life can be strange, I can't be afraid
Searching to feel your soul

[Pre-Chorus]
The strength to stand alone
The power of not knowing and letting go

[Chorus]
I guess I've found my way
It's simple when it's right
Feeling lucky just to be here, tonight
And happy just to be me
And be alive

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I guess I've found my way
It's simple when it's right
Feeling lucky just to be here, tonight
And happy just to be me
And be alive, hmm

[Intro]
Uh, we got it locked, but hey know
Oh, what whenever we around it goes down like Draino
Oh, and it's nothing to spend these pesos
And you will never see us low low
There is nothing greater
Hanging out the window, straight busting at you love haters

[Verse 1]
Bonnie, Clyde
No other girl will ever ride like I ride
That’s why you need me on your passenger side
Let me help you get that paper
Hanging out the window busting at them love haters
Me and you
I'm the closest you'll ever be to truth
There’s never a question of what I'll do, uh huh, for you
With me, you'll never lose, so...

[Chorus]
Call on your girl that can hold you right
I'll be your protector, I'll never forget ya
You need somebody that can hold you tight
I'll be in your arm love, keep you out of harm boy
I'll be your anything, everything
Rock 'n roll with ya
If things get to hot out in the cold with ya
Froze, froze with ya
Me and you together, our love could run the world
Run the world
Our love could run the world
Run the world
Our love could run the world

[Post-Chorus]
I’ll be your anything, everything
Rock ’n roll with ya
If things get to hot out in the cold with ya
Froze, froze with ya
Me and you together, our love could run the world
Our love could run the world

[Verse 2]
Make it through any weather, baby
Don't pay them any attention, it’ll just drive you crazy
All that really matters is our love for one another
And all we'll ever have is each other
Let a chick try to come around
We both know she'll never be down
She'll never have your back, wouldn’t know how to act
Can't say it no better than that

[Chorus]
Call on your girl that can hold you right
I'll be your protector, I'll never forget ya
You need somebody that can hold you tight
I'll be in your arm love, keep you out of harm boy
I'll be your anything, everything
Rock 'n roll with ya
If things get to hot out in the cold with ya
Froze, froze with ya
Me and you together, our love could run the world
Run the world
Our love could run the world
Run the world
Our love could run the world

[Post-Chorus]
I'll be your anything, everything
Rock 'n roll with ya
If things get to hot out in the cold with ya
Froze, froze with ya
Me and you together, our love could run the world
Our love could run the world

[Bridge]
Don't you see there's no love like you and me?
Can't you see, baby, there ain't nobody more powerful than we?
Can't you see that I'm the only thing you'll ever need?
Can't you see that?
Can't you see that?

[Outro]
Our love could run the world
Run the world
Our love could run the world
Run the world
Our love could run the world
Run the world
I'll be your anything, everything
Rock 'n roll with ya
If things get to hot out in the cold with ya

[Intro]
Since the 1950's, in almost every city in the United States, a silent, almost mythical crime syndicate had been terrorizing America's streets. This new-age mafioso was the likes of which the United States had never seen...
*Gunshot*
Yo, yo, what up, this big Gucci
Gucci, 1017, you can call me
We here, Brick Squad, goons
The rebels, the real
I tip my red in here to all the real niggas
And I stick my middle finger up to all the fuck niggas
This the intro, but really we don't need no introduction
It's Gucci, all I'm sayin' is get ready, 'cause we here
Let's go

[Intro: DJ Holiday]
Brick Squad Monopoly, 1017, The Commission
They say we're a product of our environment
Be sure to eat out here, nigga

Ain't that sad that my lil boy grew up gang bangin'
I couldn't be mad, Brick Squad, yeah we bang bangin'
Brick Squad, Brick Squad, yeah we bang bangin'
*Silenced gunshots*

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
They say my face is hot again, somebody got shot again
Pray and plot, I strategize, Brick Squad boys we gotta win
First in ten, I'm going in, the verdict, I did it again
I'm throwin' bricks back at the pen, went n' got out I'm worried 'bout ten
Boosie in and Gucci out, barely by a long shot
Been down there in my pocket now
All these whores be jockin' now
Red down, bread down, man down, stand down
East Atlanta my town, I'm the mayor, hands down
Got everybody flagged up, ragged up, salute me or shoot me
Recruit me, you can't 'cause I'm Gucci
Thirty six, I'm going in, some folks I don't see checkin' in
Shout out to my nigga then, in the pen, I'm goin' in

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
They say a nigga name ringin', ain't that sad that my lil boy grew up gang bangin'

[Verse 2: ?]
Red diamonds, same color as plasma, look at me on your plasma
Same nigga from the duece to the plasma

[?]
Brick Squad, paper getter, real Goodfellas
Screamin' out, "Free Duece," he named after the block
It's only right he make it pop, close your mouth P Screw
JJ roll one, think I need a cold one, streets might tear me down
At least I be drunk and high, at least I'll be fuckin' fly
Me and Gucci smoking, I might touch the sky
A tat, the only tear that's under my eye
All this pain inside, can't even cry
Just fuckin' ride, damn

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
They say a nigga name ringin', ain't that sad that my lil boy grew up gang bangin'
I couldn't be mad, Brick Squad, yeah we bang bangin'

[Verse 3: ?]
Brick Squad!
They say a nigga name ringin'
Ain't that sad if my lil man grow up gang bangin', I can't be mad
What am I to fuckin' do? Raise my child to be a chump?
Daddy never ran from beef, (Holiday season) this fuckin' heat cocked up
My hood full of gunners who protect me when I'm yawnin'
I know people who will kill you for a bag of marijuana
I'm not a murderer, but I'll get ya murdered bruh
Brick Squad militant, no casualties, I'm trained for war
Ready push the duece line, squad tatted on my neck and chest
My CEO bang, nigga, Gucci two times
A lot of dead homies, but wonder when your homie died
The realest shit I ever wrote, I'm not an easy homicide

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
They say a nigga name ringin', ain't that sad that my lil boy grew up gang bangin'
I couldn't be mad, Brick Squad, yeah we bang bangin'

The hood gone crazy, the world go rabies
I think its Slim Shady, them boys ain't right

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Sellin' that white, get everything together better have shit right

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm in love with nice lips and lip gloss
Short long hair, I don't care
I need a girl who can party all night with me
Real party girl this here can live in Flocka's world
Grab some girls for my homeboys
Bust it wide open for Brick Squad dope boys
Patron got me open, passion' out bins in VIP like I'm the pill man
Three chains on my neck, lime green flag I'm a Grove Street vet
See, that's a bet, you gon' get your ass wet
Girls screamin' out they love chief Waka's

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Them boys ain't right, the hood so crazy

Polo man, I'm a scummy, no leg shots, you better scar me
Back in '99 we was rockin' Zirconi's, like we did ponies
Dueces in the foamy, just like Kobe
Every verse is for my dead homies
Get the fuck on, nigga you a phony
Fag boy, fag boy, gun slime my alloys

[Verse 3: Yung Joc]
No Twitter talk boy, strictly confidential
Check the way the rims walk on the Continental
I always keep a rack or two just for incidentals
Rapper two on your head and call it fundamentals
Respect it or check it boy, or you could meet your maker
No this ain't a movie, but partner we'll take ya
Just ask my partner Gucci, its all about that paper
Suited for success, Ben Franklin tailored
Keep it a hundon, I like countin' papers
Four thousand ones, blow 'em into vapors
Bitch I am the son of a American gangster
I live by the guns

[Chorus: Yung Joc]
Respect my gang, respect where I hang
Know my gains the nine might bang
We get it off the

Some people gon’ be offended, I started independent
But now I'm handlin' business, two thousand dollar britches
I smear my Gods my witness, I put myself in position
But thanks for heavy whippin', it kept a new perscription
See I'm a 80's baby, know what the 80's made me
They made me proud and crazy, but I'm so far from lazy
I got them dirty birds, you know them eagles homie

I keep them pigeons on your block, dirty every day

Don’t cross, any nigga in my clique, consequences deadly
I don't speak cause I ain't friendly, AK hunnid round in my clip
You spit birds, I split birds, you gon get some shit sturred
Brick Squad bangin', yeah I’m claiming, that's my wizard
Look at the toast I pack, I'm looking for the bowl
So you know the coke I snatch, throw a body in the water whatchu know bout that
Play a pirate, and I'll give you the one eye patch

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Ride with me, no amateur

Why you fuck with him, you know he a hater
Always on my feet like a motherfuckin' gator

But just as fast as you can get it I hope you can give it
European auto, press a button, auto start
Cut that motherfucker up, they ain't ever heard of

I got a nine on the seat, shotgun in the trunk
Came to the club, I was already drunk
Laid back, young player, tryna get krunk
But if you find, might trick a little some
Same self or kill yourself, you would think I'm UPS
I'ma knock on your door, like I got your address
Dead fresh everyday, player, that's me
Trashcan bras can't smoke my trees
Gucci M-D-M, peep on me
My family need me to bring groceries
I proceed to smoke my weed
Mic check, mic check
I ain't seen nobody out-flow me yet
A vet and a vet, ride through your set
Two out of state broads and a case of Moët
A blonde, a brunette, what we gon' do next?
Good sex, good neck, they say I'm a good catch
Gucci Mane, La Flare, I don't mess with hood rats
Hit the blunt twice, girl, and pass the blunt back
I got a hundred dollar haircut
In the club with a hundred dollar haircut
Everybody say it-

That’s all that he did
2 to 6 some of us still in the sticks
Baby blue crib be true to the trim
Visits from shooters and kids, scholars and boosters it’s Friday where we do it
Real foodies come thru for the lick
Spidey sense flash whiplash maneuver the webs
The info highway, forgot where you crash
Yawn and the laugh, the yard thick, God's plan
You thinking if only's I go get it and send it before em
Whole time the memory stalking
Whole vine don’t need to be chopped
Slick fox, like Ricky we tend to the crops
Kick rocks, get lost, we gone leave a mark
Marked out cause you wrong this test isn’t hard
Infamous mob how we gon end in the starts
Scars, injuries, end up with battery charge
The battle was lost, war won I had one but I’m out of remarks
Out of sparks came the galaxy thoughts, lost

Went to school, 11, with a motherfuckin' knife
When I was 13, I got my first strike
Got my first stripe, it's Gucci Mane, La Flare

Nigga this a hood affair, every hood everywhere
When you hear this in your car, you gon' want to pull a chair up
Gucci Mane, La Flare, I be ridin' in the lair

Man I wanna be like Gucci when I grow up
All I wanna do is buy a pound and then get drow'd up

All white, just like, but you know I took ten
These gon' go for double when I get 'em back to Brooklyn

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Bricks!
All-white bricks
Off-white bricks
Light-tan bricks
Just hit a lick for fifty more bricks
Balling like a bitch with all these bricks
Bricks!
Thirty-six zips
That's a whole chick
Want a bad bitch? Gotta have bricks
Yeah that makes sense
Yeah, I make hits
But I still take bricks

[Verse 3: 8Ball & MJG]
I'm wrapped up in all dirty types of shit, so
This the dirty game, give me thirty six domes
I'm tight, MJ with the big foams
Four cock backs, baby tryna get more
You don't know about the pistol on the 

[?]
You try to catch me slippin', make me try to pop a ho
Stupid nigga, try to catch me on the smooth creek
You know I'd never keep nothin' where a nigga sleeps
That's where you gotta eat, where everything is sweet
You Dwayne Wade? You wanna bring the heat?
Bricks on the block, bricks in the trap
And when you ridin' keep a couple bricks in your lap
Don't get your feelings hurt thinkin' this is just a rap
You heard- you know where they do that at
Bitches love money, niggas make money
You not a hustler, motherfucker, you a crash dummy

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Bricks!
All-white bricks
Off-white bricks
Light-tan bricks
Just hit a lick for fifty more bricks
Balling like a bitch with all these bricks
Bricks!

[Verse 4: Shawty Lo]
All-white bricks, off-white bricks
At the bay, switch J's, so hood rich
Like ten bricks, sold 'em ASAP
To my Carolina boys, made a full cap
Ay, bricks like 

[?]
Beat the work up like I beat Tina
Nigga fly as hell
Got the thing swimming like Michael Phelps
Ay, and I don't need no medal
Chain so big, it's the size of your kid
Dun, dun, dun, done what you did
You ain't man like me and Gucci, servin' ya bricks

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Bricks!
All-white bricks
Off-white bricks
Light-tan bricks
Just hit a lick for fifty more bricks
Balling like a bitch with all these bricks
Bricks!
Yeah
Thirty-six zips
That's a whole chick
Want a bad bitch? Gotta have bricks
Yeah that makes sense
Yeah, I make hits
But I still take bricks

[Intro]
Yeah

What's happenin', it's ya boy!
Pimp so hard, nigga
Pimp so hard
Swag up, nigga, boss up, nigga
Man up
Gucci Mane, La Flare, put your chin down

[Verse]
I don't do the push up I do the kush up
I'm booked up, look up "Gucci," overbook me
Shawty gone stupid, diamonds, look Cupid
Red diamond shawty, floor, just overdo it
Supersized watch, baby check out the bezel
Gucci Mane, La Flare, I'm ahead of the schedule
My Learjet flyin' G5, shawty
Red mic, and shawty, no Levis
Hi, I'm so fly, I'm DUI and I don't know why I drive
But, I'm suicide, my doors up like a Lamb
It's Gucci Mane, La Flare, call me gamblin' Sam
Fruit Loop, I'm Toucan Sam
Gucci Mane, I gives no damn
I'm fly as fuck 'cause I'm so kushed up
And I'm so drawn up, and I sip that lean
And I smoke that green, do you know what I mean?
Don't snort no white but I sell that shit
Man I got that Chanel, man them bricks exist
Right here in the 6, right there exit
You the exit, right there, I'm Zone 6

[?] got the seventy-four O's, I restarted it bitch
In the store, it's horrific, flow so horrific
I glorified it, sex and violence, man I supply it
Gucci Mane, La Flare, I'm a firebreathin' dragon
Your girl diggin' me, show to her clique I'm attractive
Gucci, nigga, boy I go crazy
My diamonds ain't clouded, they never been hazy
Shawty got a chain on, but it don't amaze me
You spent five grand, I spent one-eighty
Hey, pay me! Fuck you, pussy nigga, don't play me!
I don't give a damn 'cause I get money
I don't talk crazy, I just talk country and funky
Bunky, I be stitchy, stanky, stunky, skunky, bunky (Huh?)
Booster-ass bitch, you can get the fuck from 'round me
Gucci Mane, La Flare, you can sign here
I lost hope on the East Coast
And I lost hope on the East Coast
And I lost hope on the East Coast
And I lost hope on the East Coast

And maybe
I'm tired of you running your mouth
And maybe
I don’t have the guts to spell it out
And maybe
I want you to hurt my brain
And baby

When you go
Where you go
I don't wanna know
When you go
Where you go
Don't tell me so

And I lost hope on the East Coast
And I lost hope on the East Coast
And I lost hope on the East Coast
And I lost hope on the East Coast
I’m a big fan
Of a rock band
You'll never understand
I got big plans
For a small man
You'll never understand

I lost my way and I need to get back
Always in the clear but I'm stuck to the tracks
And if you found your way
Who am I to say stay
If I missed my chance I don’t want second best

It always falls
It always sinks
I'll never float on top of anything
And what's my fault?
And what is yours?
I don’t care anymore

I miss my life and I wish it'd come back
It's not gonna be simple as that
Cause if you found your way I don't want second best
It's selfish but that's what I want

It always falls
It always sinks
I'll never float on top of anything
And what's the game?
Oh what’s the point?
I don’t care anymore
I don't care anymore
--last six lines are either--
Don’t you see it that way baby (?)
Don't you see you're not a baby (?)
Don't you say you’re not my baby (?)
For a lifetime of service in the name of love
I wanna thank you

[Verse 1]
I, I can't lie, I'm scared to open my eyes
'Cause what if I find nothing at all, nothing at all?
What is the point of my lips if they don't make noise? Oh
What is the point of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?

[Pre-Chorus]
The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning now

[Chorus]
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life

[Verse 2]
Real fantasy, wishing it was make-believe, oh
What is the reason of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?

[Pre-Chorus]
The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning now

[Chorus]
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song

What's your story, Colleen?

Last night I saw you in dream
Colleen, I saw you in a dream
Colleen, I saw you in a dream

These smell like cigarettes
Your coat it smells like cigarettes
Your breath it smells like cigarettes
Your hair

I got this feeling that you're not there
Feeling that you're not there
Feeling that you're not there
Feeling that you're not there

"Do Not Enter" is written on the doorway
Why can't everyone just go away?
Except you
You can stay
What do you think of my treehouse?
It’s where I sit and talk really loud
Usually
I'm all by myself
Ooh

I'm the captain but you can be the deputy
I’m really glad you think I'm so funny
I don't think I'm ever gonna let you leave

My baby's everything in me, babe
My baby’s everything in me, babe
Choked up and staring at the ceiling
I know it's wrong, but I can't shake the feeling

My baby’s everything in me, babe
My baby's everything in me, babe
My baby's everything in me, babe
Choked up and staring at the ceiling
I don't think you realize
You talk all the blame
I don’t think I'll be on time
I've always been late
Winner takes control
But you’ve gone on the way

Nothing we haven't done
And it pays to be sad

(Incomplete)
Don't stand to look
At the picture on the wall, something's telling me it's wrong
So pardon me and please
When it gets up to this point
I just don't know what to do
I get so confused
And then
(incomplete)

[Verse 1]
Turn and wait for a brand new day
Things are getting brighter
Maybe after all I'll stay
I don't wanna doubt you

[Chorus]
I can't listen to you lie
It only brings me fear
That everything's my fault
And I know what you like
And I know what you want
And I know what you want
Even if you don't

[Verse 2]
Don't take it out on me
I've been patiently waiting
Running from the endless sheets
This is a match made in heaven

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't sit and watch you cry
It only brings me fear
That everything's my fault
I'm back and forth again
I'm standing on the fence
But if I bring you joy
Then maybe it's
Then maybe it's

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't sit and watch you cry
It only brings me fear, that everything's my fault
I'm back and forth again
I'm standing on the fence
But if I bring you joy
Then maybe it's
Then maybe it's

[Verse 1: Clean]
The drought was the very worst
Oh-oh, oh-oh
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Clean]
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

[Chorus 1: Clean]
The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
I think I am finally clean

[Verse 2: Long Live]
I said, "Remember this moment in the back of my mind"
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in the stands went wild
We were the kngs and the queens
And they read off our names
The night we danced like we knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

[Chorus 2: Long Live]
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid"
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, "Long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered"

[Bridge 1: Long Live]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
And hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground

[Verse 3: New Year's Day]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

[Chorus 3: New Year's Day]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared
And you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Verse 4: New Year's Day]
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

[Chorus 4: New Year's Day]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus: New Year's Day]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

[Bridge 2: New Year's Day]
Please, don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please, don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

[Spoken]
I love you guys so, so, so, so, so much

[Verse 5: New Year's Day]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

[Chorus 4: New Year's Day]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus: New Year's Day]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you

[Outro: Long Live & New Year's Day]
And long live (Please, don't ever become a stranger)
The walls we crashed through (Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere)
I had the time of my life (Please, don't ever become a stranger)
With you (Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere)
And long live
The walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life
With you

[Verse 1]
My mother said I'm too romantic
She said, "You're dancing in the movies"
I almost started to believe her
Then I saw you and I knew
Maybe it's 'cause I got a little bit older
Maybe it's all that I've been through
I'd like to think it's how you lean on my shoulder
And how I see myself with you

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't say a word
But still, you take my breath and steal the things I know
There you go, saving me from out of the cold

[Chorus]
Fire on fire would normally kill us
But this much desire, together, we're winners
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms
'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you love me
And look in my eye
You are perfection, my only direction
It's fire on fire, mmm
It's fire on fire

[Verse 2]
When we fight, we fight like lions
But then we love and feel the truth
We lose our minds in a city of roses
We won't abide by any rules

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't say a word
But still, you take my breath and steal the things I know
There you go, saving me from out of the cold

[Chorus]
Fire on fire would normally kill us
But this much desire, together, we're winners
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms
'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you love me
And look in my eye
You are perfection, my only direction
It's fire on fire, oh
It's fire on fire

[Bridge]
Fire on fire would normally kill us
But this much desire, together, we're winners
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms

[Chorus]
Fire on fire would normally kill us
But this much desire, together, we're winners
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms
'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you love me
And look in my eye
You are perfection, my only direction
It's fire on fire

[Outro]
You are perfection, my only direction
It's fire on fire

[Intro]
Right now, I'm in a state of mind

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
They point out colors in you, I see 'em too
And, boy, I like 'em, I like 'em, I like 'em
We're way too fly to partake in all this hate
We out here vibin', we vibin', we vibin'

[Pre-Chorus]

[Outro]
Even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop so shut your mouth
Even when it's rainin' down
We turnin' up

[Verse 1]
Looking out, across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out, into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

[Chorus]
If they say why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way
If they say why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way

[Verse 2]
Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

[Chorus]
If they say why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way
If they say why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way

[Bridge]
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
(That way) Why why
(That way) Why why

[Verse 3]
Looking out, across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

[Chorus]
If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say
Why, why, ooo tell 'em
Why, why does he do me that way
If they say why, why, cha cha cha cha cha cha
Why does he do me that way
If they say why, why, why, ooo tell 'em
Why does he do me that way
If they say why, ooo tell 'em
Why does he do me that way
If they say why, da da da da da da da da
Why why does he do my that way, I like living this way
Why, oh why, why, why

[Verse 1]
Santa baby, I hear you've got some presents for me, Miley
I've been an awfully good girl
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 2]
Santa baby, I don't need any fancy jewelry
Not me, I've got something else in mind
Santa baby, and I don't need your presents tonight

[Verse 3]
Don't want diamonds, cash, or stars
Nothing that comes in a box
No more fluff, I've had enough
And I can buy my own damn stuff

[Verse 4]
Santa baby, I bought a baller car of my own
My own, I bought it all by myself
Santa baby, with zero help from Elf on a Shelf

[Verse 5]
Listen Santa to what I say
A girl's best friend is an equal pay
So stop interrupting me when I talk
And don't text me pictures of your... *ringtone*

[Verse 6]
Santa baby, I'd love to know my ass won't get grabbed at work
By some ignorant jerk
Tell the dirtbag to put away the chimney tonight

Put away the chimney tonight
Just put away your chimney tonight
So put away your chimney tonight
So put away your chimney tonight

[Intro: Madonna]
Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
Missy and Madonna boy, ain't nothin' better
Hotter than fat bitches dancin' in a sweater
Madonna am I okay skinny or fatter
When I rap on this track, all I smell is cheddar
You and I together, yo' we're tougher than leather
Make pop artists scatter when we talk chit-chatter
It really don't matter what time of day or weather
Or who ass really fatter, my kadunk-kadunk badder
A rap so sick, won't stop, won't quit
All on my dick, like my name was 50 Cent, G-Unit
I come with the heat, see my hits
Sound so sweet, Missy ain't pissy
Is you dizzy, is you with me
Tip me when you see me, 'cause you tryna get with me
Madonna bring the drama, oh mama that's trauma
Tougher than armor for your pappy and your mama

[Verse 2: Madonna & Missy Elliott]
I tried to be a boy, I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess, I tried to be the best
I guess I did it wrong, that's why I wrote this song
This type of modern life, is it for me?
(I'd like to express my extreme point of view)
(I'd like to express my extreme point of view)
(A Madonna exclusive)
So I went into a bar, looking for sympathy
A little company, I tried to find a friend
It's more easily said, it's always been the same
This type of modern life, is not for me
This type of modern life, is not for free
Do I have to change my name?
(C'mon)

[Chorus: Madonna & Tweet]
American life
(American life)
I live the American Dream
(American Dream)
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream
(Just a dream)

[Verse 3: Madonna]
I tried to stay ahead, I tried to stay on top
I tried to play the part, but some how I forgot
Just what I did it for, and why I wanted more
This type of modern life, is it for me?
Fuck it
Ah, fuck it
Ah, fuck it
Ah, fuck it
Ah, fuck it, uh-huh

[Chorus: Madonna & Tweet]
American life
(American life)
I live the American Dream
(American Dream)
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream
(Just a dream)

[Interlude: Missy Elliott]
This is a Madonna exclusive
This is the American life, fuck it

[Verse 4: Madonna]
I'm drinking a soy latte
I get a double shoté
It goes right through my body, and you know I'm satisfied
I drive my Mini Cooper, and I'm feeling super-dooper
Yo, they tell I'm a trooper, and you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and pilates, and the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out the bodies, and you know I'm satisfied
I'm digging on the isotopes, this metaphysics shit is dope
And if all this can give me hope, you know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager, an agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant, and a driver, and a jet
A trainer, and a butler, and a bodyguard, or five
A gardener and a stylist, do you think I'm satisfied?
I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just living out the American dream
And I just realized that nothing is what it seems
What it seems

[Chorus: Madonna & Tweet]
American life
(American life)
I live the American Dream
(American Dream)
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream
(Just a dream)
(American life)

[Outro: Missy Elliott]
This is the American Life, fuck it

[Verse 1]
I tried to be a boy
I tried to be a girl
This modern life, is it for me?
I tried to be a mess
I tried to be the best
This modern life, is it for free? (Free, free, free, free)

[Chorus]
American Life
American Dream
American Life

[Verse 1]
I tried to be a boy
I tried to be a girl
This modern life, is it for me?
I tried to be a mess
I tried to be the best
This modern life, is it for free? (Free, free, free, free)

[Chorus]
American Life
American Dream
American Life
American Life
American Dream
American Life

[Verse 2]
I tried to stay ahead
I tried to stay on top
This modern life, is it for me?
I tried to play the part
But somehow I forgot
This modern life, is it for free? (Free, free, free, free)

[Chorus 1]
American Life
American Dream

[Verse 1]
I tried to be a boy
Tried to be a girl
Tried to be a mess
Tried to be the best
Tried to find a friend
Tried to stay ahead
Tried to stay on top (Fuck it)

Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?
Do I have to change my name?

[Outro]
I'm drinking a soy latte
I get a double shoté
It goes right through my body, and you know I'm satisfied
I drive my Mini Cooper, and I'm feeling super-dooper
Yo, they tell I'm a trooper, and you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and pilates, and the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out the bodies, and you know I'm satisfied
I'm digging on the isotopes, this metaphysics shit is dope
And if all this can give me hope, you know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager, an agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant, and a driver, and a jet
A trainer, and a butler, and a bodyguard, or five
A gardener and a stylist, do you think I'm satisfied?
I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just living out the American dream
And I just realized that nothing is what it seems

Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
Youse a hood rat
I just want you to know
You get no dough

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
I wonder why I captured her sight, it had to been the ice
Brown skin, eyes weird like Russell Simmon's wife
Now I'm thinking 'bout busting in her twice
Brown color, corn bread, best customer in sight, aight
Her body tight, too tough not to look
Louis Vutton shoes, getting cuffed, 

[?] a book
Smiled up the room, a Colgate grin
Spurs throwback hat with the oak grey timbs
Big cup full of Hennessy
Nah, that bitch ain't my girl, just whenever I'm around she pretend to be
Look, I don't dance much (no)
I'm in the club with the toast
If you're wondering why I'm pulling my pants up
My nympho lives on the edge and watches the WNBA
Wears braids and headbands, she cute plus her brain's sick
And she don't flip when I look at another chick
Cause she's looking at the same bitch

[Chorus: Pharrell + Lloyd Banks]
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
Youse a hood rat
I just want you to know
You get no dough

See, I just want you
To know that you are really special

Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
See, I just want you
To know that you are really special

Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg, (Pharrell)]
Snoop Dogg Clothing, that's what I'm groomed in
You got my pictures on the wall in your room, and
Girls be complaining you keep me boomin'
But girls like that wanna listen to Pat Boone
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
You's a college girl, but that don't stop you from doin'
Come and see the Dogg in a hood near you in
You don't ask why I roll with a crew, and
Twist up my fingers, and wear dark blue and
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
On the Eastside, that's the crew I choose
Nothing I do is new to you
I smack up the world if they rude to you
'Cause baby girl, you're so beautiful

[Chorus: Pharrell + Lloyd Banks]
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl

I was in my bed
Going through the times we had
The hardest way for one to learn
To lose it all but if she returns

[Chorus]
I’ll go
If she wants I will meet her there
At the parade or the harvest fair
I swear always
I’m not afraid to share my love anymore

[Verse 2]
I was in the yard
Filling pecans in a mason jar
Up to bake some humble pie
Whatever it takes to keep her by my side

[Chorus]
I’ll go
If she wants I will meet her there
At the parade or the harvest fair
I swear always
I’m not afraid to share my love anymore
I’ll go
If she wants I will meet her there
At the parade in the market square
I swear always
I’m not afraid to share my love anymore

Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are
I'm good on the side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark
No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored
'Cause I live down the street so we meet when you need it, it's yours
All I hear is

[Chorus]
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like

You keep my hand around your neck

Your back against the wall, this is all you've been talking about
My ears

God rest ye merry, gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ, our Savior
Was born on Christmas Day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy!

[Verse 2]
From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed angel came;
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy!

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Now to the Lord sing praises
All you within this place (Sing praises)
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace (Brotherhood)
This holy tide of Christmas
All beauty in disgrace
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

[Verse 1]
Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

[Chorus]
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'

[Verse 2]
Sometimes it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

[Chorus]
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'

[Outro]
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I keep on breathin', oh yeah
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
I keep on breathin', mmm, yeah
Come see me brood high and I'll wash your feet
By the one, two, threes
I'll steal occasion to mangle
In full wither, cannot sleep
There ain't a soul around
In all God's, all God's country now

Come meet me with the morphine in the engine room
We'll exit this, can't touch your wrist without weeping
My patron saint of the evening
When the rain don't touch the ground
In all God's, all God's country now

Now I've got three dilemmas
One I leave unspoken
A legend to my left age, no ride home
A mystery in progress
Somewhere across the canyon
In a rental I've never been
You're praying at a full sprint
For me
And I was your guest to meet the heiress
I smoke out back
Fish through my jacket and practice
Practically nothing
Lest my lost gets found
In all God's, all God's country now

Jack clearly want to buy the scene full on
I know it's all just rock 'n' roll to you, Jack
But some of us gotta live here
So you steal no more than they can bust you for
In all God's country now

And I'm just a running boy
Who knows he cannot be caught
I feel alright but I'm not feeling well
This newborn sentiment
Squalor we have in common
Baptism in your bedlam brouha
I am knee high on the far side
Of a doorstep in your dream

[Verse]
Spent 24 hours
I need more hours with you
You spent the weekend
Getting even, ooh ooh
We spent the late nights
Making things right, between us
But now it's all good baby
Roll that Backwood baby
And play me close

[Chorus]
'Cause girls like you
Run around with guys like me
'Til sundown, when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Girls like you
Love fun, yeah me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah

[Drop]
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you

[Verse 2]
I spent last night
On the last flight to you
Took a whole day up
Trying to get way up, ooh ooh
We spent the daylight
Trying to make things right between us
And now it's all good baby
Roll that Backwood baby
And play me close

[Chorus]
'Cause girls like you
Run around with guys like me
'Til sundown, when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Girls like you
Love fun, yeah me too

Staying is my grind, I've been drinking on the low
Pour up lean and sigh, hope I see you when you go

No need to be silent, see a lot go (Woo)

[Chorus]
That's my nigga (Woo)
Man I miss my my realest nigga (Woo)
Mad they took my nigga
Yeah my nigga, yeah my nigga, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
How do we celebrate? In loving memory
How do we celebrate? In loving memory
I should go defecate, just to set records straight

[?] Hope you in a better place
How do we celebrate? In loving memory

[Verse 2]
Police shut my mind down, visit on my free time
Ricky facing fair time, celebrate the mean time
I’ma hold it down
I'ma pop a bottle, another round to go around
I'ma hold it down
I'ma fuck this model, never hold it down around
Always on a head-high, police on a head-lock
Niggas acting red now, I can't think in red now
Smoking cigarettes now, I ain't got no regrets now

Money problems, that's expected
Marijuana, ass, and breastes

[Spoken Word: David Bowie]
Everybody...
This has been one of the greatest tours of our lives, we really...
But first, I'd like to thank the band, I'd like to thank our road crew, and I'd like to thank our lighting people
Of all the shows on this tour, this particular show will remain with us the longest, because...
Not only is it the last show of the tour, but it's the last show we'll ever do. Thank you

[Spoken Word: Richard Kimball]
Hi, this is 

[?] read-a-long with Richard Kimball from the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, and the house lights are about to go down for you. Appearance of David Bowie

[Audience Cheering]

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
Well she's a tongue twisting storm
She'll come to the show tonight
Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey not my money
She's a funky-thigh collector
Laying on electric dreams

[Chorus]
Well come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well come on, well come on
If you think we're going to make it
You better hang on to yourself

[Verse 2]
We can't dance, we don't talk much
We just ball and play
But then we move like tigers on Vaseline
You know the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the Blessed
We're The Spiders From Mars

[Chorus]
Yeah, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well come on, well come on
If you think we're going to make it
You better hang on to yourself

[Bridge]
Come on
Lay it on

[Chorus]
Well come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well come on, well come on
If you think we're going to make it
You better hang on to yourself

Well come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well come on, well come on
If you think we're going to make it
You better hang on to yourself

[Outro]

[Audience Applause]

[Intro]
Ooh yeah
Uh!

[Verse 1]
Now Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And The Spiders from Mars
And he played it left hand
But he made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's Band

[Verse 2]
Now Ziggy really sang
Screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
Oh he could kill ’em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
He came on so loaded man
Well hung, snow white tan

[Chorus 1]
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?

[Verse 3]
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were Voodoo
The kids was just crass
He was the nazz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But boy could he play guitar

[Chorus 2]
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind, ah
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed a man
I had to break up the band
Oh yeah

[Outro]
Now Ziggy played guitar

[Audience Applause]

[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
I still don't know what I was waiting for
And time was running wild
A million dead-end streets
And every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame
Pretty soon you've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time

[Bridge]
Strange fascination, fascinating me
Ah, changes are taking the pace I'm going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Changes
Oh, look out you rock 'n rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Oh changes
Pretty soon now you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

[Piano Outro]

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
When all the world was very young
Mountain magic heavy hung
The supermen would walk in file
Guardians of a loveless isle
And gloomy browed with super fear, their tragic endless lives
Could heave nor sigh
In solemn, perverse serenities, wondrous beings chained to life

[Chorus 1]
Strange games they would play then
No death for the perfect men
Life rolls into one for them
So softly a supergod cries

[Verse 2]
Where all were minds in uni-thought
Power weird by mystics taught
No pain, no joy, no power too great
Colossal strength to grasp a fate
Where sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers
Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold
A man would tear his brother's flesh, a chance to die
To turn to mold

[Chorus 2]
Far out in the red sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod cries
Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod dies

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
Pushing through the market square
So many mothers sighing
News had just come over
We had five years left to cry in
News guy wept and told us
Earth was really dying
Cried so much that his face was wet
Then I knew he was not lying
And I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys and toys and electric irons and TVs
My brain hurt like a warehouse
It had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store
Everything in there
And all the fat, skinny people
And all the tall, short people
And all the nobody people
And all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people

[Verse 2]
A girl my age went off her head
Hit some tiny children
If the Black hadn't pulled her off
I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour
Drinking milk shakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Don't think you knew you were in my song
And it was cold and it rained, so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race
The way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful
I want you to walk

[Outro]
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
Five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got

[Verse 1]
Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills
And put your helmet on
(10) Ground Control (9) to Major Tom (8)
(7, 6) Commencing (5) countdown
Engines on (4, 3, 2)
Check ignition (1)
And may God's love (Liftoff) be with you

Ahhh...

[Verse 2]
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You’ve really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirt you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I’m floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

[Chorus]
For here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Verse 3]
Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you-

[Chorus]
Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

Ohhh
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh
Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha
Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha

[Audience Applause]

[Spoken Word: David Bowie]
Thank You

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
Like to take a cement fix
Be a standing cinema
Dress my friends up just for show
See them as they really are
Put a peephole in my brain
Two New Pence to have a go
I'd like to be a gallery
Put you all inside my show

[Chorus]
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, silver screen
Can't tell them apart at all

[Verse 2]
Andy walking, Andy tired
Andy take a little snooze
Tie him up when he's fast asleep
Send him on a pleasant cruise
When you wake up on the sea
Be sure to think of me and you
He'll think about paint
And he'll think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do

[Chorus]
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, silver screen
Can't tell them apart at all
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all

[Instrumental Outro]

[Audience Applause]

[Spoken Word: David Bowie]
Playing to you on the courtesy of a piece of palm tree. I asked for lobster tail and they brought me palm tree, a piece of palm tree

[Verse 1]
My death waits like an old roué
So confident I'll go his way
Whistle to him and the passing time
My death waits like a bible truth
At the funeral of my youth
We drank for that and the passing time
My death waits like a witch at night
As surely as our love is bright
Let's not think of that or the passing time

[Chorus]
But whatever lies behind the door
There is nothing much to do
Angel or devil, I don't care
For, in front of that door
There is you

[Verse 2]
My death waits like a beggar blind
Who sees the world through an unlit mind
Throw him a dime for the passing time
My death waits to allow my friends
A few good times before it ends
Ah let's not think about the passing time
My death waits there between your thighs
Your cool fingers will close my eyes
Let's not think about the passing time

[Chorus]
But what ever lies behind the door
There is nothing much to do
Angel or devil, I don't care
For in front of that door
There is you

[Verse 3]
My death waits there, among the leaves
In magician's mysterious sleeves
Rabbits and dogs and the passing time
My death waits there among the flowers
Where the blackest shadow cowers
So let's pick lilacs for the passing time
My death waits there, in a double bed
Sails of oblivion at my head
Let's not think about the passing time

[Chorus]
But whatever lies behind the door
There is nothing much to do
Angel or devil, I don't care
For, in front of that door
There is you

[Audience Applause]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me

[Verse 2]
Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked "Why not?" and I replied "I don't know"
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped Khalil Gibran
And I cried for all the others 'til the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
So I said "So long" and I waved bye-bye
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said, you'll never go down to the Gods again
(Turn around, go back!)
He struck the ground, a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said, do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back!)
His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said, do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back!)
Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed
Waiting for you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
I'm up on the eleventh floor
And I'm watching the cruisers below
He's down on the street
And he's trying hard
To pull sister Flo
My heart's in the basement
My weekend's at an all time low
Because she's hoping to score
So I can't see her
Letting him go
Walk out of her heart
Walk out of her mind

[Chorus]
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat
And bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

[Verse 2]
She's an old-time ambassador
Of sweet talking, night walking games
And she's known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it
Then she can do it
She don't make false claims
But she's a Queen
And such are queens
That your laughter
Is sucked in their brains
Now she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down

[Refrain]
But it could have been me
Yes, it could have been me
Why didn't I say
Why didn't I say, no, no, no

[Chorus]
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat
And bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

[Verse 3]
So I lay down a while
And I gaze at my hotel wall
Oh the cot is so cold
It don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah I lay down a while
And I look at my hotel wall
But he's down on the street
So I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab
Because my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth
And it's no taste at all

[Refrain]
It could have been me
Oh yeah, it could have been me
Why didn't I say
Why didn't I say, no, no, no

[Chorus]
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat
And bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

Thank you, this is a song written by Ziggy

[Verse 1]
I'm an alligator
I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm a space invader
I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
So keep your mouth shut
You're squawking like a pink monkey bird
And I'm busting up my brains for the words

[Chorus]
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!

Don't fake it baby
Or lay the real thing on me
The church of man, love
Is such a holy place to be
Make me baby
Make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air

Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!

[Chorus]
John, I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But I'm only dancing

[Verse 2]
Shadow love was quick and keen
Life's a well thumbed machine
Saw you watching from the stairs
You're everyone that ever cared
Oh lordy
Oh lordy
You know I need some loving
Move me, touch me

John, I'm only dancing

I'm waiting for my man
Twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington, 125
So sick and dirty, more dead than alive

[Chorus]
I'm waiting for the man

[Verse 2]
Hey, white boy, what you doin' uptown?
Hey, white boy, you chasin' all the women around?
Oh pardon me sir, it's the furthest from my mind

[Chorus]
I'm waiting for my man
La-ta-ta

[Verse 3]
Here he comes, he's all dressed in black (Oh!)
PR shoes and a big straw hat
He's never early, he's always late
First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait
I'm waiting for my man

[Verse 4]
Brownstone, up three flights of stairs
Everybody's pinned you, but nobody cares
He's got the works, gives you sweet taste
And then you gotta split because you got no time to waste

[Chorus]
I'm waiting for my man
La-ta-ta, ti-ta-ti-ta
La-ta-ta, ti-ta-ti-ta

[Verse 5]
Baby don't you holler, darlin' don't you bawl and shout
I'm feeling good, you know I'm gonna work it on out
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling, oh, so fine
Until tomorrow, but that's just some other time

[Chorus]
I'm waiting for my man
I'm waiting for my man

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go, and everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie

(Get back one)

[Chorus]
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Sits like a man, but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie

[Chorus]
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
He's so simple minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
He loves to be loved
He loves to be loved

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
Hey man, oh leave me alone you know
Hey man, oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
Hey man, I gotta straighten my face
This mellow thighed chick just put my spine out of place
Hey man, my schooldays insane, I said
Hey man, my work's down the drain, I said
Hey man, well she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she, but then she

[Chorus]
Oh don't lean on me man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh don't lean on me man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it

She's all right

[Verse 2]
Hey man, Henry, don't be unkind
Hey man, I can't take you this time, no way
Hey man, droogie don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, she comes

[Chorus]
Oh don't lean on me man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City

Oh, Suffragette
Suffragette!

[Spoken Word: David Bowie]
Good night. Thank you

[Audience Applause]

[Spoken Word: Announcer]
You hear the applause
And that's a bid for David Bowie to come back on
And they are coming back on
We're at the Santa Monica Civic in 1972
First of two performances in town
They're back on stage
They'll perform some more
That's standing ovation

[Verse 1]
Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, but you still you forget
Oh oh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

[Verse 2]
You're too old to lose it and you're too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

[Verse 3]
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Don't let the milk float past your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural, religiously unkind

[Chorus]
Oh no love! You're not alone
You're watching yourself but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up
But if I could only make you care
Oh no love! You're not alone
No matter what or who you've seen
No matter where or when you've been
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone!
Just turn on with me and you're not alone
Just turn on with me and you're not alone
Gimme your hands cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Gimme your hands cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Oh!

[Audience Applause]

[Spoken Word: David Bowie]
Good night, thank you

[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills
And put your helmet on
Ground Control to Major Tom
Commencing countdown
Engines on
Check ignition
And may God's love be with you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirt you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

[Chorus]
For here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you

[Chorus]
Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Instrumental outro]

[Verse 1]
Someday they won't let you
So now you must agree
The times they are a-telling
And the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, and the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage jaw of 1984
They'll split your pretty cranium, and fill it full of air
And tell that you're eighty, but brother, you won't care
You'll be shooting up on anything, tomorrow's neverthere
Beware the savage jaw of 1984

[Chorus]
Come see, come see, remember me?
We played out an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 (Who could ask for more?)
1984 (Who could ask for...)
(Mor-or-or-or-ore)

[Verse 2]
I'm looking for a vehicle, I'm looking for a ride
I'm looking for a party, I'm looking for a side
I'm looking for the reason that I knew in '65
Beware the savage jaw of 1984

[Chorus]
Come see, come see, remember me?
We played out an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 (Who could ask for more?)
1984 (Who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore?)
(Mor-or-or-or-ore)

[Outro]
1984 (Who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore?)
1984 (Who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore?)
1984 (Who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore?)
1984 (Who could ask for more?)

[Audience Applause]

[Intro]
Hot tram, loved you so
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)

[Verse 1]
You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's go out tonight
You like me, and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on

[Chorus]
Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel Rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I loved you so!
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel Rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I loved you so!
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)

[Bridge]
You've torn your dress, your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?

[Outro]
Rebel, rebel
Rebel, rebel

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
I'm an alligator
I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm a space invader
I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut
You're squawking like a pink monkey bird
I'm busting up my brains for the words

[Chorus]
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Don't fake it baby
Lay the real thing on me
The church of man, love
Is such a holy place to be
Make me baby
Make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air

[Chorus]
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah

[Instrumental Bridge]

Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head, I said
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah

[Instrumental Bridge/Guitar Solo]

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
It's safe in the city to love in a doorway
Wrangle some screams from the dawn
And isn't it me, putting pain in a stranger?
Like a portrait in flesh, trails on a leash
Will you see that I'm scared and I'm lonely?
So I'll break up my room, and yawn and I'll
Run to the center of things
Where the knowing one says

[Chorus]
Boys, boys, its a sweet thing
Boys, boys, its a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing"

[Verse 2]
I'm glad that you're older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile, isn't that me?
I'm in your way, and I'll steal every moment
If this trade is a curse, then I'll bless you
And turn to crossroads and hamburgers

[Chorus]
Boys, boys, its a sweet thing
Boys, boys, its a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here then
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing

[Guitar Solo/Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 3]
I'll make you a deal, like any other candidate
We'll pretend we're walking home 'cause your future's at stake
My set is amazing, it even smells like a street
There's a bar at the end where I can meet you and your friend
Someone scrawled on the wall "I smell the blood of les tricoteuses"
Who wrote up scandals in other bars
I'm having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumors and lies and stories they made up
Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that you'd never been seen
But there's a shop on the corner that's selling papier mache
Making bullet-proof faces; Charlie Manson, Cassius Clay
"If you want it, boys, get it here, thing"
So you scream out of line:
"I want you! I need you! Anyone out there? Any time?"
Tres butch little number whines "Hey dirty, I want you
When it's good, it's really good, and when it's bad I go to pieces"
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
Well, on the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I put all I have in another bed
On another floor, in the back of a car
In the cellar of a church with the door ajar
Well, I guess we must be looking for a different kind
But we can't stop trying 'til we break up our minds
'Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights
Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright
I guess we could cruise down one more time
With you by my side, it should be fine
We'll buy some drugs and watch a band
Then jump in the river holding hands

[Chorus]
Boys, boys, its a sweet thing
Boys, boys, its a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here then
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing

[Reprise Chorus]
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing
Is it nice in your snow storm, freezing your brain?
Do you think that your face looks the same?
Then let it be, it's all I ever wanted
It's a street with a deal, and a taste
It's got claws, it's got me, it's got you

[Audience Applause]

[Piano Intro]

[Verse 1]
I still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

[Verse 2]
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time

[Bridge]
Strange fascination, fascinating me
Changes are taking the pace I'm going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Oh, look out you rock 'n rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

[Saxophone Outro]

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
Hey man, oh leave me alone you know
Hey man, oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta

Hey man, well she’s a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she, then she

Watching him dash away
Swinging an old bouquet (dead roses)

Takes him away to war (Don't fake it)
Sadden glissando strings

Who will love Aladdin Sane
Battle cries and champagne

Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25
What a speed drive
Don't want to stay alive when you're 25

[Verse 2]
Wendy's stealing clothes from unlocked cars
Freddy's got zits from ripping off stars from his face
A funky little boat race

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The television man is crazy
Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
But, man, I need a TV when I've got T. Rex
Hey, brother, you guessed

He can kick like a mule
It's a real mean team
Oh, we can love
Yes, we can love

And my brother's back at home
With his Beatles and his Stones
We never got it off on that revolution stuff
Oh it's such a drag
Too many snags

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well, I drunk a lot of wine
And I'm feeling fine
Gonna race some cat to bed
Is this concrete all around
Or is it in my head?
Oh, brother, you guessed

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I've come on a few years from my Hollywood Highs
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had
I’m stiff on my legend, the films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty cause you just got paid

[Chorus]
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you’re knocking me dead
Oh stay, please stay, please stay

[Verse 2]
Caught yourself a trick down on Sunset and Vine
But since he pinned you baby you're a porcupine
You sold me illusions for a sack full of cheques
You've made a bad connection cause I just want your sex

[Chorus]
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
You always were the one that knew
They sold us for the likes of you
I always wanted new surroundings
A room to rent while the lizards lay crying in the heat, yeah
Trying to remember who to meet

[Bridge]
I would take a foxy kind of stand
While tens of thousands found me in demand

[Chorus]
When you rock and roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody down here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock and roll with me

[Verse 2]
Gentle hearts are counted down
The queue is out of sight and out of sounds
Me, I'm out of breath, but not quite doubting
I've found a door which lets me out

[Chorus]
When you rock and roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock and roll with me

[Guitar Solo]

Oh, when you rock and roll with me
No one else I'd rather be, love
Nobody down here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock and roll with me

When you rock and roll, rock and roll with me
No one else I'd rather be, love
Nobody down here can do it for me
I'm in tears, I'm in tears
When you rock and roll with me

[Outro]
Oh yeah
Oh, oh, no
Oh, oh, yeah

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
I don't want to lose this good thing that I've got
'Cause if I do, I would surely, surely loose a lot
'Cause your love is better than any love I know

[Chorus]
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I'd better knock on wood, baby

[Verse 2]
I'm not superstitious about you, but I can't take a chance, no
You got me spinning, baby, spinning in a trance
'Cause your love is better than any love I know

[Chorus]
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I'd better knock on wood

[Verse 3]
It's no secret, that woman is my loving cup
Well, she sees to it that I get enough
Just one touch from her, you know it means so much

[Bridge]
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I'd better knock on wood, baby
I better knock, knock, knock

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Hey Jack, I better shake it off
Put her out of my head
The thinking of all, just another young girl last night
Oh brother! I left a woman
In that morning day
Been on that trip so many times
Good God, was really yesterday

[Verse 2]
I've tried so many, many, many, many, many
Many ways
I've lied and taken off into the day
Leaving another girl to
Weep over the breakfast tray
Loved her before I knew her name
Hit me! Jack, 'cause I'm
Gone, love her way

[Chorus]
Come back, my babe
Come back, my babe
Be holy again, I gave her
I gave her, maybe, maybe
Maybe, gotta give her, ooh baby, baby, baby
That kind of love, can only destroy
I gave her, maybe, maybe
Get it down if I'm gonna be her baby, 'cos, baby
Gonna be me, it's gonna be me

[Verse 3]
There was no rein to check me
When all those little things walked on by
Oh! but I couldn't feel this, stammer out a word
When that angel stuck in my mind
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Lookin' for love won't hold me back
No
I'm gonna love her way

[Chorus]
Come back, my babe
Come back, my babe
Be holy again, I gave her
I gave her, maybe, maybe
Maybe, gotta give her, ooh baby, baby, baby
That kind of love, can only destroy
I gave her, maybe, maybe
Get it down if I'm gonna be her baby, 'cos, baby
Gonna be me, it's gonna be me

[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 4]
Just playing that latest record
Waitin' for the telephone to ring
Wiped out and bitter, with a
Bag clutched in her hand
All the cars sound like they're
Pulling in the drive
No, no, no, no, no

[Bridge]
I see her now
A little tear running down her check
Laugh! Let down
People looking for me
I want to race down her street
And knock hard, hard, hard on the door 'til
Until she breaks down in my arms like a
Treasured toy and I feel her pain
I'll be so strong, again and again

[Chorus]
Come back my baby
I'm hold you again, I'll take you
I'll take you, baby, baby, baby
Baby, we're gonna have, ooh baby, baby, baby
My kind of love, can only bring you joy, I'm gonna
Yeah, baby, baby, yeah, I'll give you baby, baby, baby
'Cos it's gonna be me, it's gonna be me

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Tod Browning's Freak you was
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected, for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal

[Chorus]
(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

[Verse 2]
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, oh Tarzan, go man go
Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed, Diamond Dogs are stabilised

[Chorus]
(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Call them the diamond dogs
Call them the diamond dogs

[Verse 3]
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
(There's gonna be sorrow) try and wake up tomorrow

[Chorus]
(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dog

[Outro]
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Bow-wow, woof woof, bow-wow, wow
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Dogs
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, call them, ooo
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Keep cool
Diamond Dogs rule, OK
Hey-hey-hey-hey
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs

[Keyboard Intro]

[Verse 1]
Don't talk of dust and roses
Or should we powder our noses?
Don’t live for last year's capers
Give me steel, give me steel, give me pulsars unreal
He'll build a glass asylum
With just a hint of mayhem
He’ll build a better whirlpool
We'll be living from sin
Then we can really begin

[Bridge]
Please saviour, saviour, show us
Hear me, I'm graphically yours

[Chorus]
Someone to claim us, someone to follow
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo
Someone to fool us, someone like you
We want you Big Brother, Big Brother

[Outro]
Brother
Hoo, hoo
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up
Brother
Hoo, hoo
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up
Brother
Hoo, hoo
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up
Brother
Hoo, hoo

[Audience Applause]

[Verse 1]
Time, he's waiting in the wings
He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me, boy

[Verse 2]
Time, he flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me, boy

[Verse 3]
Time, in Quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time

[Pre-Chorus]
The sniper in the brain
Regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain
And many other last names
Well, I look at my watch it says 9:25 and I think
"Oh God! I'm still alive."

[Chorus]
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La

[Verse 4]
You are not a victim
You just scream with boredom!
You! are not evicting time

Ow!

[Verse 5]
Chimes, goddamn, you're looking old
You'll freeze and catch a cold
'Cause you've left your coat behind
Take your time

[Pre-Chorus]
Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams
I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind
But love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed
Your park was real and dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now
Smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was guilt for dreaming

[Outro Chorus]
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Yeah, time!

[Intro]

[Audience Cheering]

It's another bad 

[?]

[Verse 1]
A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and
Ate all our razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go, and everything tastes nice
Poor Jean Genie

(Get back one)

[Chorus]
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Sits like a man, but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while
Cracks in the sand, she won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor Jean Genie
Ohhh

[Chorus]
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
He's so simple minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved
Loves to be loved

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go

[Chorus]
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go

Go
Oh, go

[Instrumental Outro]

[Audience Applause]

[Piano Intro]

[Verse 1]
Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Oh oh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

[Verse 2]
You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

[Verse 3]
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural, religiously unkind

[Chorus]
Oh no love! You're not alone
You're watching yourself but you're too unfair
You've got your head all tangled up
But if I could only make you care

Oh no love! You're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain

[Outro]
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone!
All you've gotta do is just turn on me
You're not alone
Just turn on with me
You're not alone
Oh you're wonderful
And you're wonderful
Hey
Hey 'cause you're wonderful

[Audience Applause]

[Audience Applause]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
(Dancing) I'm having so much fun
(Dancing) Too bad my back had gone
(Dancing) Boogie down with David now
I'd give my house in the country
If you'd slept it's so funky

[Verse 2]
(Music) I'm dancing in the street
(Ooh, music) I've torn the shoes from my feet
(Romancing) It's got me dirty and sweet
It's got you reeling and rocking
Won't you let the slender thing in

[Verse 3]
(Rolling) I think it's all I can do
(Rolling) Just got me feeling you too
(Rolling) Get a little take a little back
Jumping John, the great goose is gone
Got a lion in my hand, a Charlie on my back

[Chorus]
(John) I'm only dancing
(She turns me on) I'm only dancing
(She turns me on) Oh get you with me
(Don't get me wrong) Ah ha ha ha ha

[Verse 4]
(Dancing) Well have you heard the news?
(Dancing) President has lost the blues
(Dancing) It needs some A-B-C
If he gives it to you
He'd better take it from me

[Verse 5]
(Sad sir) I pick up the bones
(Sad sir) Off your telephones
(Sad sir) Leave the numbers alone
Look the people in the eye
Tell them my oh my
Let your backbone slide

[Chorus]
(John) I'm only dancing
(She turns me on) I'm only dancing
(She turns me on) Oh yes
(Don't get me wrong)
I'm only dancing, oh-ho, yeah
I'm only dancing, oh-ho, yeah
(John) I'm only dancing

[Verse 1]
You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Verse 2]
Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Bridge]
Hey, ehh, ehh, eyy
Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay, ehh, ehhy
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one

[Chorus]
When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Verse 1]
Said she tired of little money, need a big boy
Pull up 20 inch blades like I'm Lil’ Troy
Now it's everybody flockin', need a decoy

You was talkin' shit in the beginning (Mm-mm)
Back when I was feelin' more forgivin' (More forgivin')
I know it piss you off to see me winnin' (See me winnin')
See the igloo in my mouth when I be grinnin’ (I be grinnin’), yeah

[Chorus]
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It’s a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" (Wow, wow)
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me (On me)
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me (Know me)
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely

Cut the roof off like a nip-tuck
Pull up to the house with some big butts
Turn the kitchen counter to a strip-club (Yeah, wow)
Me and Dre came for the...
When I got guap, all of y'all just appeared (Wow)
Before I dropped Stoney, none of y'all really cared (Cared)
Now they always say, "Congratulations," to the kid (Kid)

Used to have a lot, but I got more now (Yup)
Made another hit 'cause I got bored now (Yup)
Always goin' for it, never punt fourth down
Last call, Hail Mary, Prescott touchdown, ayy

[Chorus]
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me (On me)
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army (Hey)

[Verse 1]
I wish that I could swim and sleep like a shark does
I'd fall to the bottom and I'd hide till the end of time
In that sweet cool darkness
Asleep and constantly floating away

[Verse 2]
I wish that I could break and mend like the world does
I'd fall to the bottom and I'd chase all my dreams away
And I'd let you crush me
My dreams would be constantly melting away

[Verse 1]
I wish that I could swim and sleep like a shark does
I'd fall to the bottom and I'd hide til the end of time
In that sweet cool darkness
Asleep and constantly floating away

[Verse 1]
Always been a little bit fast and wild
My mama always said I was a problem child
I'm just livin' life until the day I die
It's all I know, that's how I roll

[Pre-Chorus]
I party, get naughty
Always tellin' myself I'll never do this again
I'm sorry that you caught me
Fuckin' in the hotel, it didn't mean anything

[Chorus]
Don't let me, don't let me go
I just wanna let you know that I'm no angel
But I can learn, oh
Baby, I'm bad to the bone
I just wanna let you know that I'm no angel
But I can learn

[Verse 2]
The second that you saw me, you were mesmerized
Bet you probably thought I was your ride or die
Don't wanna burst your bubble, but I cheat and lie
It's the truth, I'm bad news

[Pre-Chorus]
I party, get naughty
Always tellin' myself, I'll never do this again
I'm sorry that you caught me
Fuckin' in the hotel, it didn't mean anything

[Chorus]
Don't let me, don't let me go
I just wanna let you know that I'm no angel
But I can learn, oh
Baby, I'm bad to the bone
I just wanna let you know that I'm no angel
But I can learn, oh

[Post-Chorus]
Promise I'll try, promise I'll try (oh)
Promise I'll try, promise I'll try (oh)
I'm no angel, but I can learn

[Bridge]
Instrumental Break

[Chorus]
Don't let me, don't let me go
I just wanna let you know that I'm no angel
But I can learn, oh
Baby, I'm bad to the bone

But I can learn, oh

[Post-Chorus]
Promise I'll try, promise I'll try (oh)
Promise I'll try, promise I'll try (oh)
I'm no angel, but I can learn
Please complete me
It must be the answer
Everything just seems to be numbness around
Why aren't you near me?
What stars are you under?
If only I could hear from you right now
Did your mind every clear of me?
Has your faith found a pastor?
Or am I still in shapes of the clouds
Did you see me on TV?
Have you seen the disasters?
We don't have long       (?)
Till the earth is drowned  (?)
If only I'd seen clearly
As we lay beneath thunder
Feeling the fear and the pride
The pride that brought me down
They all stood and cheered me
What made your departure?
I still remember you walking off in the crowd
The moon appears freely
But arose to the structure
Days and nights they let me down
This place doesn't move me
Everything just seems to be constantly letting me down
This place doesn't move me
Everything just seems to be constantly letting me down
This place doesn't move me
This bow has no archer
The numbness around
Must be the answer
Everything just seems to be numbness around
Please complete me

He’s loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

Although it’s been said many times
Many ways, Merry Christmas to you

Eight maids a-milking
Seven swans a-swimming
Six geese a-laying
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three french hens
Two turtle doves, and
A partridge in a pear tree

[Verse 10]
On the tenth day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Ten lords a-leaping
Nine ladies dancing
Eight maids a-milking
Seven swans a-swimming
Six geese a-laying
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three french hens
Two turtle doves, and
A partridge in a pear tree

[Verse 11]
On the eleventh day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Eleven pipers piping
Ten lords a-leaping
Nine ladies dancing
Eight maids a-milking
Seven swans a-swimming
Six geese a-laying
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three french hens
Two turtle doves, and
A partridge in a pear tree

[Verse 12]
On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Twelve drummers drumming
Eleven pipers piping
Ten lords a-leaping
Nine ladies dancing
Eight maids a-milking
Seven swans a-swimming
Six geese a-laying
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three french hens
Two turtle doves, and
A partridge in a pear tree
Eat one and throw the rest away
Eat one and throw the rest away
When you live alone at Christmas-time
Your diet’s turnin’ on a dime
Eat one and throw the rest away

Eat one more then throw the rest away
Just eat one more then throw the rest away
(Come on)
Just eat one more, it couldn’t hurt
Tonight my dinner is dessert
Eat one more then throw the rest away

Rapidly eat as many as you can before you throw the rest away
Rapidly early as many as you can before you throw the rest away
Cause you don’t want to be fat for New Year’s
You just want to stand here above the garbage
And eat all of the ????? Away

Go back into the garbage for some you threw away
Go back into the garbage for some you threw away
Tonight you know your diet’s wrecked
And you have got no self-respect
Go back into the garbage and (uhh uhh uhhhh)

[tuba section]
No, you’re an adult, you can live with snacks
You might as well just try and put these back

[Verse 2: YBN Almighty J]
Walk in this bitch with some racks

Bad bitch, I put her on a flight
You hate but you broke, how that work?
She keep tryna take off her skirt
I want the head first
Drinking, my head hurt
I dropped a bag on some teeth
You put your bitch in a Jeep
Balenciaga, please don't step on my feet
In the trap playing with racks, I walk around like a geek
She want the ass shot, so I bought it
You do what you want when you ballin'
My diamonds wet like a fish tank
I got Hollywood bitches in Burbank
Chanel on the tag, we trippin'
We went from rags to riches
I need a boujee bitch, I'm tired of these average bitches
Pourin' on a pint, now I'm sleepy
Bald headed bitches like E.T
Why the bitch act like she need me?
My diamonds shine bright like RiRi

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Walk in this bitch with a stick
Walk in this bitch with a brick
Make the wrong move and my nigga gon shoot

Yall pay attention ta dis i'ma show yall some real shit right now

[Verse 1: ]
3:30 in tha mornin i'm in my house chillin
Niggas kicked in my side doe
And started runnin threw da kitchen
I peeped out tha doe, seen a nigga wit a K
Dressed in all black wit a ski mask on his face
So i bussed out tha doe, started shootin at that bitch
And tha 1st bullet missed, but tha next 5 hit
So i cut tha lights off, then i crouched down ta da ground
Took a look at Arab, said "nigga don't make a sound!"
Had my pistol in my hand so i knew i had tha power
Heard footsteps gettin louuder and louuder
I ran out tha doe, started bussin wit my 9
6 bullets left tha clip, but 5 on me hit his spine
Now he layin on tha ground, screamin like a hoe
He thought his homeboys was real, but they ran out tha doe
Now he lyin on tha flo, screamin like a lil bitch
When i shot him he dropped his pistol now hee ain't got shit
I told Arab, "go and take a look around da place."
Den i walked up ta dis nigga, snatched dat mask off his face
After i saw who it was, itz a face i couldn't forget
I can't believe deez niggas came and tried ta rob me fa my shit
After all i did fa yall, this tha fuckin thanks i get
Tried ta take ya out tha hood and tried ta make you niggas rich
So dey kicked in my doe and tried ta jack me fa my shit
Yall niggas ain't got no heart, thatz some real foul shit
So i sit back taday and i thank inside my head

This some real shit i'm spittin, hope ya heard what i said

You know I'm number one

Press one button, it pull apart

I like unicorns, strawberries, X-rated porn
I like orange juice, flashing swords and chocolate mousse
I like dropping bombs, termination, killer songs

I like cups of tea, trampolining, sexy dreams
I like apple pie, mixing beats and telling lies
I like history boys, cutting cakes and children's toys
I like dinosaurs, pterodactyl, watch me roar!

T-Rex, dinosaur sex!

There was a time, the laughing time
I took my heart to every party
They'd point my way
"How are you today?"
"Will you make us laugh? Chase our blues away? "
Their funny man won't let them down
No, he'd dance and prance and be their clown
That time, the laughing time
When even a fool learns to love

The clown turned around
And saw her smile, oh how she loved me
She'd clap her hands and beg me stay
To make her laugh, to make her life gay
Who wants the love of all the world
When here was love in the eyes of just one girl
That day, that precious day
When even a fool learns to love

But oh, how I dreamed, a marvelous dream
Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed
With thunderous applause looked down from above
On a clown and an angel so much in love
I'll stay with my dream, it takes such a dream
And even a fool learns to loveThat day, that hateful day
The joke turned stale, the game was over
Those spiteful words "Oh, go away. Who wants to play? "
"It's getting late now."
My world, my funny world
Had lost it's mask and shown a broken heart
A time, a sour time
When even a fool learns to love
But oh, how I dreamed, a marvelous dream
Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed
With thunderous applause looked down from above
On a clown and an angel so much in love
I'll stay with my dream, it takes such a dream
And even a fool learns to love

[Intro]

So sad her eyes
Smiling dark eyes
So sad her eyes
As it began

[Verse 1]

On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone
And all around the air did say
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known

[Chorus]

The White Queen walks and the night grows pale
Stars of lovingness in her hair

[Bridge]

Needing - unheard
Pleading - one word
So sad my eyes
She cannot see

[Verse 2]

How did thee fare, what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And 'neath her window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came

[Chorus 2]

White Queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no word would make
So still I wait

[Bridge]

My Goddess, hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
It's for evermore that I wait

[Outro]

Dear friend goodbye
No tears in my eyes
So sad it ends
As it began
Jungle time for me and you
You knew we were gonna have a cat fight sometime soon
Get your claws out and get ready to lose
Get your claws out, yeah

From the word go you knew I was a bitch
From the word go, I was playing my magic tricks on you
Get your mother out of my face, yeah you know I think she's a dickhead
Get your mother out of my face, yeah you know I think she's a dickhead

Jungle, jungle, jungle
Jungle time for me and you
Jungle, jungle, jungle
Get ready to rumble, get ready to lose
Jungle, jungle, jungle
Jungle time for me and you
Jungle, jungle, jungle
Get ready to rumble get ready to lose

You think you're such a special one, don't you, darling?
Because of your big blue eyes and 

[?] Prince Charming
Stop making excuses for that big mistake you make
'Cause you've always been like this and it's never gonna change
You don't have a pretty face and you don't have a brain
You say you're originality, but you're most of the same
But when I see you dancing now, I just wanna punch you in the face
'Cause you're feet illiterate and your body don't pull no shapes

Jungle, jungle, jungle
Jungle time for me and you
Jungle, jungle, jungle
Get ready to rumble, get ready to lose
Jungle, jungle, jungle
Jungle time for me and you
Jungle, jungle, jungle
Get ready to rumble, get ready to lose
Get ready to rumble, get ready to lose
Get ready to rumble, get ready to lose
Get ready to rumble, get ready to lose
Armor on my torse to protect this open hole that's on the left side of my chest
I left my heart at home, no test
Tell my momma I be home in second
I know that this gold ain't pressing
Don't know how to fold under pressure
Never-
Aye, always late
And I ain't phased by the 

[?] all black
Mister put the flame to the ethanol pack, yuh
Trying see the old in me but half of me attended by the past
I'm sipping on a flask, this is whiskey I ain't pass
And the spliffs into 

[?]

[Chorus]
I am not here right now, I am not home
Leave a message after the life, flat line tone
I am not here right now, I am not home
Leave a message after the life, after I'm gone

[Open Verse]

[Chorus]
I am not here right now, I am not home
Leave a message after the life, flat line tone

[Open Verse]

[Chorus]
I am not here right now, I am not home
Leave a message after the life, flat line tone
I am not here right now, I am not home
Leave a message after the life, after I'm gone

[Harmonica solo]

I left my heart, in San Francisco
High on a hill, it calls to me
To be where little cable cars
Climb halfway to the stars
The morning fog may chill the air
I don't care, my love waits there

In San Francisco
Above the blue and windy sea
When I come home to you, San Francisco
Your golden sun will shine for me

[Harmonica solo]

When I come home to you, San Francisco
Your golden sun will shine for me

Will shine for me, oh, oh

[Verse]
Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style someday
Oh, dream, dream-maker
You heartbreaker
Wherever you're going, I'm going your way
Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end
Waiting 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend
Moon river
Moon river and me

[Harmonica solo]

[Outro]
We're after the same rainbow's end
Waiting 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend
Moon river
Moon river and me
And me
I'll be waiting 'round the bend
Huckleberry friend
Moon river and me
Waiting 'round the bend

[Verse 1]
Love is sterling threads of gold
Treasure 'til the heart grows old
When my love you stole from me
You said I'd wait patiently

[Chorus]
And wait for you to come home
I'll wait for you to come home
I need you so

[Verse 2]
With my heart you went away
Leaving your heart in its place
Flying softly in the breeze
I can hear you sing to me

[Chorus]
I'll wait for you to come home, yeah
I'll wait for you to come home
I need you so

[Bridge]
I need your love with me
If you are here or across the sea
Love me as I love you
And girl I know we'll see it through, yeah

[Verse 3]
Though we cry so far away
Tears of joy we'll see one day
In my dreams, you're close to me
I can hear you say to me

[Chorus]
I'll wait for you to come home, yeah
I'll wait for you to come home
I need you so

[Bridge]
They can't keep you away
I'll find the road to you someday
And baby, the day I do
I'll make our every wish come true, oh yeah

I will never say goodbye
Even though my heart may cry
Oh, wait, the world must be a fool
I will sit and dream of you

[Chorus]
And wait for you to come home, yeah
I'll wait for you to come home
I need you so

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Sunday morning, I go running through a field
Jump across old Hogshead Creek down in the hollow
They're just waiting by the old well that's run dry
Sitting on a log that's lying by the willow
That's the one place that belongs to her and me
That's the place where papa never looked to find us
Underneath that willow tree, onlly place I wanna be
With a girl as sweet as sugar right beside me, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm just a little ol' boy with a river full of joy
'Cause I got myself a little girl that loves me
That river's deep and wide with my baby by my side
I got honey love to drown in with my baby

[Verse 2]
There was sugar, in her yellow Sunday dress
Singing to the willow that we carved our names in
Yelling to her, put my arms around her tight
Pull her closer and whisper, "Give your boy some sugar" (Hey, yeah, yeah)
Baby's kisses are like apple berry wine
And I tell her 'cause I never wanna lose her

[Chorus]
I'm just a little ol' boy with a river full of joy
'Cause I got myself a little girl that loves me, loves me, loves me, loves me
That river's deep and wide with my baby by my side
I got honey love to drown in with my baby

[Bridge]
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ooh)

[Verse 3]
Sun is glowing, that old sun that melts the sky
But my baby keeps the fire warm inside me (Hey, yeah, yeah)
And your father cooking food by Hogshead Creek
Supper's ready and he knows just where to find me, yeah
Ain't no secret, on that lovers willow tree
River caught the stream and mama's calling for me

[Chorus]
I'm just a little ol' boy with a river full of joy
'Cause I got myself a little girl that loves me, yeah
That river's deep and wide with my baby by my side
I got honey love to drown in with my baby
I'm just a little ol' boy with a river full of joy
'Cause I got myself a little girl who loves me, loves me, loves me
That river's deep and wide with my baby by my side
I got honey love to drown in with my baby

[Verse 1]
I never knew that you could do
What I needed to make me true
You've got me beat, I can't cheat
Here I sit on that mercy seat
My lovin' you is overdue
Girl, I'm making my way to you
I've been looking for your love too long
And now that I've found it, gotta keep it strong

[Chorus]
So won't you give me all of your lovin'
Oh, don't stop 'til you give me all of your lovin'
(Give me all, give me all)
Give me all of your lovin'
Don't stop 'til you give me all of your lovin', yeah

[Verse 2]
All my friends, they wonder when
I'd be looking for love again
Can't they see, it's you and me
You're the flower, I'm the honeybee
I've been looking for a flower too long
With you is where this honeybee belongs

[Chorus]
So won't you give me all of your lovin'
Oh, don't stop 'til you give me all of your lovin'
(Give me all, baby, give me all)
Give me all of your lovin'
Don't stop 'til you give me all of your lovin'
Give me all of your lovin'
(You know I sho'nuff need your lovin')
Don't stop 'til you give me all of your lovin'
Give me all of your lovin'
Don't stop 'til you give me all of your lovin'

[Verse 3]
I never knew what love could do
'Til I fell in love with you
And now I see what's there for me
All love is is my girl and me
Heaven made me a world of my own
Where me and my baby could get along

[Chorus]
So won't you give me all of your lovin'
Oh, don't stop 'til you give me all of your lovin'
(Give me all, give me all, baby)
Give me all of your lovin'
Don't stop 'til you give me all of your lovin'
(Give me all, give me, give me, give me...)

[Announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen
For once in my lifetime, there's someone to love me
Would you welcome please, the exciting young man of song
Mister Stevie Wonder
(Cheers and applause)

You, hey, you were good at playing the fox girl
When I was good, you threw me a bone
But I ain't playing hot for nobody
Girl, just you wait 'til I get you home
I'll show you the way to love somebody
Like you've never ever ever been shown
Because my love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you, woo

You played around with Jimmy and Freddie
You tried to make me look like a fool
But I took care of Cindy and Susie
Just to show you I can be twice as cool, baby
If you want to learn how to love me
I'll teach you in my own private school
Because my love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you
Let me hear you say it
When you play with my affection, say it
When you tried to make me walk the line
When you decided you would hurt me
Ah, when your grape feel from the vine
Your mama told me that I better be mellow
She said, "You're just a baby, maybe too green"
I told her Jimmy, Freddie, Teddy and Victor
They know better, mama shake off that dream
Ooh, I told her that you really were cooking
There was more love turning to steam

'Cause my love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you, woo, hey

You met your match
When you told me you loved me, say it
When you said that you won't let go

You met your match, you met your match
You met your match, you met your match
You met your match, baby, woo, get down
You met your match, you met your match
You met your match, you met your match
You met your...

You met your match, you met your match
You met your match, you met your match
You met your...
You met your match, you met your match
You met your match, you met your match
You met your...

You met your match, you met your match
You met your match, you met your match

You met your match, you met your match
You met your match, you met your match

You met your match, you met your match
You met your match, you met your match
You met your match, you met your match
You met your match

What I'm trying to say
Is when you find that you're too good for anybody else
You're just right for Stevie, mmm-hmm

[Intro]
Thank you very much

[Verse 1]
Hey love
May I have a word with you?
I'd like to tell you, yeah
Just what I've been going through
My nights are so long
As I watch each hour go by
Hoping and praying
That someday I will be your guy

[Chorus]
Hey love
Why, you're my one true soul desire
Oh, my lovely, lovely, lovely baby
Can you feel this burning fire?

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, hey, hey love
There's one thing I find so true
When you're near Stevie love, when you're near me, baby
You send Steve through a change or two, mmm-hmm
Hearing your footsteps
I hurry to catch your eye
Stand there waiting, I stand there waiting, baby
Oh, but, darling girl, you just walk on by

[Chorus]
Say love
With a cold heart you are dealing
Oh, my sweet, my baby, yeah yeah
It's an awful hurting feeling
Woo, oh

[Verse 3]
Little bitty lover
Don't pass me without some sign (Hey love)
Look me over, baby, look me over, love
Hmm, you might want to change your mind

[Outro]
Hey love
Stevie pretty little lovely one
Oh, my love, baby, baby
You know I need your love
Because you please me, lover
Let me hear you say "Hey lover," come on
I really love you, little lovely one—say it, baby
Because you please me, lover
Everybody needs somebody, and I need you
You know I do, baby
'Cause everything's good about you
I couldn't do without you
And if you ever need me
It shoulda been your Stevie
And can't you hear me say
"Hey love, hey love, hey love, hey love"
Lovely one

[Intro: Paul Williams]
Mhm
Hoo, hoo

[Verse 1: Paul Williams]
I was often running, chasing rainbows
Hoping somehow I'd find
The answer to all of my dreams
Somewhere on the other side
I didn't realize, without true love you can't survive

[Chorus: Paul Williams]
And darling, all I need is just
For you to say you love, love me
Of all the girls in this whole wide world
I know you were made for me, mhm

[Verse 2: Paul Williams]
Now as I look through my windows
I see the mist has rolled away
Through eyes of love, as I gaze above
I catch a glimpse of a sunny day
Just put your hand in mine
Happiness together, darling, we'll surely, surely find

[Chorus: Paul Williams]
Now all I need is just
For you to say you love me, love me
Of all the girls in this whole wide world
I know you were made for me

[Bridge: Paul Williams]
Mhm, mmm
Just say you want me now

[Verse 3: Paul Williams]
In the darkness of the night
I picture myself holding you tight
In the brightest of the dawn
I find you still in my arms
Everybody knows that you're the one girl I truly adore

[Chorus: Paul Williams]
And darling, all I need is just
For you to say you love me
Of all the girls in this whole wide world
I know you were made for me

[Outro: Paul Williams]
I will wait for ya, until the moon fades away
I would for ya, darling, and
All I need is just for you to say you love me
All the girls in this whole wide world know you were made, you were made for me
Hoo, all I need is just for you to say you want me sometime, darling, darling
All I need is just for you to say you need me, darling

[Intro]
Mhm, mhm, mhm

[Verse 1]
The yellow moon kissed the velvet sky
Two flowers kissed as the breeze passed by
The darkness stretched its arms to embrace earth's charms
And on my window pane, my tears fell like rain

[Chorus]
'Cause all I want is a little bit of love
One teeny weenie little bitty kiss
All I want is a little bit of love from you, yeah, baby

[Verse 2]
To you, I'm just a face in the crowd
Each day you pass, your head's in a cloud
As I wait breathlessly for one sweet word to me
You walk away, footsteps fade away

[Chorus]
But all I want is a little bitty word
One teeny weenie weenie bitty sweet little word
All I want is a little bit of love from you
Little bit of love will do, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
I guess I must be out of my mind
Loving someone that don't even know that I'm alive
Each day you're starry-eyed with someone by your side
Near but far, like reaching for a star

[Chorus]
But all I want is a little bitty spot
One teeny little, little bitty spot in your heart
All I want is a little bit of love from you, oh baby

[Outro]
Little bit of love, baby
Hey, a little bit of love, baby, yes, darling
All I want is a little bit of love, hey, yeah
Little bit of love, love, love, love, love
Gots to get my love, love, love, love, love
Can't give you diamonds and pearls, can't give you the world
I just want love, love, love, love, love
My God's gift, give you love, love, love, love, love
A little bit of love will do, baby, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow
I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called "Yellow"
So then I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

[Chorus 1]
Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
You know, you know I love you so
You know I love you so

[Verse 2]
I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

[Chorus 2]
Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
And you know
For you, I'd bleed myself dry
For you, I'd bleed myself dry

[Bridge]
It's true, look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine

[Outro]
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do

[Intro]
My Lucifer is lonely

[Verse 1]
Standing there, killing time
Can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
All the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Post-Chorus]
My Lucifer is lonely

[Verse 2]
Look at you needing me
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery
Walk in wearin' fetters
Peter should know better
Your cover up is caving in
Man is such a fool, why are we saving him?
Poisoning themselves now
Begging for our help, wow

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
All the good girls go to Hell (All the good girls go to Hell)
'Cause even God herself (God herself) has enemies
And once the water starts to rise (Water starts to rise)
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Post-Chorus]
My Lucifer is lonely
There's nothing left to save now
My god is gonna owe me
There's nothing left to save now

[Outro]
Haha!
I cannot do the snowflake

[Verse 1]
It's not true
Tell me I’ve been lied to
Crying isn't like you, ooh
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through, ooh

[Chorus]
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn’t mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh

[Verse 2]
Up all night on another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry

[Chorus]
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh

[Bridge]
The smile that you gave me
Even when you felt like dying

[Outro]
We fall apart as it gets dark
I'm in your arms in Central Park
There's nothing you could do or say
I can’t escape the way I love you
I don’t want to, but I love you, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Intro: Gucci Mane & Young Thug]
Go, go, Wop, huh

All this gold on me, I’m looking for a gold digger
It ain't her fault, I guess she used to fuckin' broke niggas

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
This lil bitch dancing on the table, where her table manners?
Haters watching my Snapchat like it's they favorite channel
Had to put my cape on and my wings, fly in, and save Atlanta
I'm in a ragin' cajin', seats Caucasian, amazing Phantom
I was a corner boy, I turned into a drug lord
I tell her go bitch, I tell her go bitch
I need a nigga like a need another gun charge
I tell her go bitch, I tell her go bitch
I wear four watches on one arm, I'm tryna punish these bitches
Any problems that I had man I confronted the snitches
Soon as they let me out the Feds I tried to run to the dentist
And now I’m smiling with the money in the front of the Bentley

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Started in the trap, now I’m a plug nigga
Lil bitch you know you dealin' with a drug dealer
All this gold on me, I’m looking for a gold digger
It ain't her fault, I guess she used to fuckin' broke niggas

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Fuck with these poor niggas
You fuck with these broke niggas

[?] nigga
I was just serving that soap to niggas
I ran up my rackades
You bleeding, no band-aid
I'm dripped in my white but no mayonnaise
Red rag on my head match the fanny
She dripping my sauce
I got a new whip and it cost
That fire come out the exhaust
I just throw 10 racks at the bar
I just could’ve bought a new loft
But instead I just got high as a star
I just could've chopped off a roof
I just poured a 8 in some juice
I hopped in a Rolls and I tore up the streets
I got a new Jeep and I tore out the seats
I tear out the guts just to ride up the street
I tear off the shoes and I put on some feet
I turn up my baby and now she unique
She cool as a fan, got her off of the street
Today I feel just like 

[?]
Today I might just go 

[?]

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Young Thug]
Started in the trap, now I'm a plug nigga
Started, started in the trap, now I'm a plug, hey
Lil bitch you know you dealin' with a drug dealer
I said little bitch you know you dealin' with a drug dealer, yeah
All this gold on me, I'm looking for a gold digger
I said all this gold on me, I'm looking for a gold digger
It ain't her fault, I guess she used to fuckin' broke niggas

[Intro]
All is love
Confessed the bitch in me, yeah

He's my baby
Boyfriend said
Love is a bit gay
But everytime I feel it
It's Cra Cra

[Hook]
I said hey
Is it a sign of the times?
Can we go find something money can't buy?
I said hey
Is it a sign of the times?
Is it too late to find something can't buy?

[Verse 1]
Okay I got this
I'm thankful for my hands
Cuz it's a good thrower
I'm thankful for my body
Cuz it's a fucking banga
I'm thankful for my mouth
Cuz it's a real screamer
But most of all
I'm thankful for...
My POWA!

[Bridge]
I need fresh feets
Fresh sheets
Need some space
I need two weeks
Don't wanna blow up we got
Can we take it slow?

[Verse 2]
I hesitate, but your face makes me stay
Cuz it says the things your mouth never said
If I obey and let you have your way
But I come in it to me and it save me

[Hook]
I said hey
Is it a sign of the times?
Is it too late to find something can't buy?
I said hey
Is it a sign of the times?
Is it too late to find something can't buy?

[Outro]
I'm thankful for my hands
Cuz it's a good thrower
I'm thankful for my body
Cuz it's a fucking banga
I'm thankful for my mouth
Cuz it's a real screamer
But most of all
I'm thankful for...
My POWA!

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
Yesterday, woke up on the hotel floor
Then I stole my ex's car
Sign it with a lipstick mark
Over it, had to kiss his ass goodbye
He was low and I was high
Popping Valiums on Valentines

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
If he just gave you flat line when you want trampoline (Whoa-oh)
If you be in the penthouse when he on mezzanine (Whoa-oh)
Then you just gotta tell him "Catch my level or leave"
You gotta look him in the eye
Middle finger to the sky and say

[Chorus: TYNI]
Too bad for you, honey
'Cause I don't want your lovin', lovin', yeah
Lovin', lovin', yeah
Too bad
Too bad for you, honey
'Cause I don't want your lovin', lovin', yeah
Don't need your lovin', lovin', yeah
Too bad for you

[Verse 2: Charli XCX]
Yesterday I was countin' up big stacks
But you were tryna hold me back
Pedal to the metal, I can't get with that
No, over it, maybe you're just not my type
Should've swiped left, not right
'Cause I just wanna live my life

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
If he just gave you flat line when you want trampoline (Whoa-oh)
If you be in the penthouse when he on mezzanine (Whoa-oh)
Then you just gotta tell him "Catch my level or leave"
You gotta look him in the eye
Middle finger to the sky and say

[Verse 1]
Open-minded, I'm so blinded
Mystery man, woman phantom
Violet light smears the atmosphere
I'm so scared, but I'm standing here

[Pre-Chorus]
Is what I am seeing real, or is it just a sign?
Is it all just virtual?

[Chorus]
We could be lovers, even just tonight
We could be anything you want
We could be jokers, brought to the daylight
We could break all of our stigma
I'll, I'll be your enigma
I'll, I'll be your enigma
I'll, I'll be your enigma
I'll, I'll be your enigma

[Verse 2]
Can't stop staring, I'm so naked
Wrapped in shadows, my heart races
Dragon's eyes watch, goddess breathing
Give me something to believe in

[Pre-Chorus]
Is what I am seeing real, or is it just a sign?
Is it all just virtual?

[Chorus]
We could be lovers, even just tonight
We could be anything you want
We could be jokers, brought to the daylight
We could break all of our stigma
I'll, I'll be your enigma
I'll, I'll be your enigma
I'll, I'll be your enigma
I'll, I'll be your enigma

[Chorus]
We could be lovers, even just tonight

[Spoken Intro]
This next song is called "The Edge of Glory", and I really wanted to play it for everyone tonight because it's the second Thanksgiving I'm spending without my grandpa, and I wrote this song about him. So, here it is, this is "The Edge of Glory"
So grandma, if you're watching at home, this song's for you

[Verse 1]
There ain't no reason you and me should be alone
Tonight, yeah, baby
But I got a reason that you-hoo should take me home tonight
I need a man that thinks it right when it's so wrong
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
Right on the limit's where we know we both belong, tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
It's hot to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

[Chorus]
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you

[Break: Spoken]
One of my favorite memories with my grandpa and my grandma right around Thanksgiving, and it's actually leading up to Christmas time, is that they make these cookies called pizzelle's. If you're Italian, you know what those are. They're like really flat waffles, but they're really thin and crisp. My grandpa would always make the pizzelle and would always work the machine, and everybody had to "I got it, outta the way, outta the way, outta the way". That was my grandfathers thing, he made the pizzelle's, so I don't know why, but right now, I'm just thinking about the Italian cookies

[Verse 2]
Another shot, before we kiss the other side
Tonight, yeah, baby
I'm on the edge of something final we call life, tonight
(Alright! Alright!)
Put on your shades, I know your dancin' the flames
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
Oh, it isn't hell if everybody knows my name, tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
It's hot to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

[Chorus]
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment
Baby, with you
I'm on the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment
I'm on the edge with you, with you, with you, with you
With you, with you, with you, with you

Pause for a minute and ask yourself why

[There's fire in the city]
The red glow of fire lights up the sky

[There's fire in the city]
And the sound of the siren screams through the 

[black]

[There's fire in the city]
And the streets re-echo with the rifle's crack

[There's fire in the city]

Oh what are the thoughts that go racing through your brain
And mess your mind up
At the sight of the city that’s gone completely insane
Where will it wind up

Come on with me let me take you down there

[There's fire in the city]
To the hate-haunted canyon of human despair

[There's fire in the city]
Over the dark invisible wall

[There's fire in the city]
Through the sickening stench of the tenament hall

[There's fire in the city]
Oh how can I tell in terms of black and white
Why there's fire in the city tonight

Oh what are the thoughts that go racing through your brain
And mess your mind up
At the sight of the city that's gone completely insane
Where will it wind up

I know by your face that you don’t know the sound

[There's fire in the city]
Of a club that's beaten a man to the ground

[There's fire in the city]
Where your home is your prison, your skin a disgrace

[There's fire in the city]
And the gates of your nation swing shut in your face

[There's fire in the city]

Oh how can I tell you in terms of black and white
Why there's fire in the city tonight

Oh what are the thoughts that go racing through your brain
And mess your mind up
At the sight of the city that's gone completely insane
Where will it wind up

Oh pause for a minute and ask yourself why

[There's fire in the city]
The red glow of fire lights up the sky

[There's fire in the city]
And at the sound of the siren you really know

[There's fire in the city]
That you truly do reap just what you sow

[There's fire in the city]
Oh how can I tell you in terms of black and white
Why there's fire in the city tonight
Oh how can I tell you in terms of black and white
Why there's fire in the city tonight
Oh how can I tell you in terms of black and white
Why there's fire in the city tonight

I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Disco, disco, disco... stick...
(huh)...

[Verse 1]
I wanna kiss you
But if I do, then I might miss you, babe
It's complicated and stupid
Got my ass squeezed by sexy Cupid
Guess he wants to play, wants to play a lovegame, a lovegame

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Love me, love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit it
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Disco, disco, disco... stick...

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Marilyn Manson, Both]
Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame
Do you want love, or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans, the lovegame
Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame
Do you want love, or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans, the lovegame
Love, game, love, game, fame
Love, game, love, game, fame

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
I'm on a mission
And it involves some heavy touching, yeah
You've indicated your interest
I'm educated in sex, yes
And now I want it bad, want it bad
A lovegame, a lovegame

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit it
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Disco, disco, disco stick...

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
I can see you staring there from across the block
With a smile on your mouth and your hand on your (huh)
The story of us, it always starts the same

[Verse 1]
We are the crowd
We're c-coming out
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you, it's so magical
We'd be so fantastical
Leather and jeans
Garage glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us, it don't have a price
Ready for those flashing lights
'Cause you know that, baby, I...

[Chorus]
I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar you know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

[Verse 2]
I'll be your girl backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah, 'cause you're my rockstar in between the sets
Eyeliner and cigarettes
Shadow is burnt
Yellow dance and we turn
My lashes are dry
Purple teardrops, I cry
It don't have a price
Loving you is cherry pie
'Cause you know that, baby, I...

[Chorus]
I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar you know that I'll be

Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

[Bridge]
Real good
We dance in the studio
Snap snap to that shit on the radio
Don't stop for anyone
We're plastic, but we still have fun!

[Chorus]
I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me ( follow you until you love me)
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar you know that I'll be

[Intro]
Fame
Doin' it for the fame
'Cause we wanna (La, la la la)
The rich and famous

[Verse 1]
I can't help myself
I'm addicted to a life of material
It's some kind of joke
I'm obsessively opposed to the typical
All we care about is runway models, Cadillacs and liquor bottles
Give me something, I wanna be retro glamour
Hollywood, yes, we live for the...

[Chorus]
Fame (Fame)
Doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame (Fame)
Doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we got a taste for champagne and endless fortune

[Post-Chorus]
Fame, fame, baby
The fame, fame
We live for the fame, fame, baby
The fame, fame
Isn't it a shame, shame, baby?
A shame, shame
In it for the fame, fame, baby
The fame, fame

[Verse 2]
I can see myself in the movies, with my picture in city lights
Photograph my mind
And whatever else you'd like to shoot, you decide
All we care about is pornographic girls on film and body plastic
Give me something
I wanna see television, and hot blondes in odd positions

[Chorus]
Fame (Fame)
Doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame (Fame)
Doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we got a taste for champagne and endless fortune

[Post-Chorus]
Fame, fame, baby
The fame, fame
We live for the fame, fame, baby
The fame, fame
Isn't it a shame, shame, baby?
A shame, shame
In it for the fame, fame, baby
The fame, fame

[Bridge]
Don't ask me how or why, but I'm gonna make it happen this time
My teenage dream tonight
Yeah, I'm gonna make it happen this time
Fame
(This time, this time, this time...)

[Break]
Fame
Doin' it for the fame
'Cause we wanna (La, la la la)
The rich and famous

[Intro: Lady Gaga]
Now you won't stop calling me
Now you won't stop calling me
Now you won't stop calling me
Kinda busy
Breaking up on me
Now you won't stop calling me
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand
Now you won't stop calling me
You should've made some plans with me
Now you won't stop calling me
Kinda busy
Stop, stop, stop...

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Beyoncé]
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to talk anymore

Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to talk anymore
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to talk anymore
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to talk anymore
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to talk anymore

[Verse 1: Beyoncé with Lady Gaga]
Boy, the way you blowing up my phone won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster, leave my girls no faster
I should've left my phone at home 'cause this is a disaster
Callin' like a collector, sorry, I cannot answer
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station
Tonight, I'm not taking no calls 'cause I'll be dancing
'Cause I'll be dancing, 'cause I'll be dancing
Tonight I'm not taking no calls, 'cause I'll be dancing

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to talk anymore

Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to think anymore
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to talk anymore

[Outro: Lady Gaga]

You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Nothing to lose
Gotta choose, nothing to lose (Nothing to lose)
Gotta choose, nothing to lose (Nothing to lose)
Gotta choose, nothing to lose (Nothing to lose)
Gotta choose, nothing to lose

She's got both hands in her pocket
And she won't look at you, won't look at you
She hides true love, en su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger, around you

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta choose, nothing to lose (Nothing to lose)
Gotta choose, nothing to lose (Nothing to lose)
Gotta choose, nothing to lose (Nothing to lose)
Gotta choose, nothing to lose (Nothing to lose)

[Chorus]
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro

[Verse 2]
She's not broken
She's just a baby
But her boyfriend's like her dad, just like her dad
And all those flames that burned before him
Now he's gotta firefight, gotta cool the bad

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose
You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

[Chorus]
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando

[Outro]
I know that we are young, and I know that you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this anymore
Alejandro...

[Verse 1]
Stop the truck, hand my keys to the valet
That's the moment that I see her as she leaving
I say excuse me, how could I convince you to stay?
Then my phone goes to ringing in, ringing in
(No I don't wanna) but I gotta answer this call
Could you wait, it really won't be long?
(And then the kid came) told me he was my biggest fan
Camera flashes, turn around and she's already gone

[Pre-Chorus]
How'd I get distracted, I
Don't know what happened, I
Turn back around and I was just one step too late
Oh you got, away, away, you flew away, away
Oh

[Chorus]
I lost my Angel in L.A., L.A
(And where she at?)
Has anybody seen her?
I'm out here checking for my, Angel in L.A., L.A
(And where she at?)
I'm posting pictures of her
(And where she go?)
She got me driving around the backstreets
I thought I saw walking right past me
I called you didn't answer to your name
Where's my angel?
Where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where'd you go?
(No I don't wanna)
(And then the kid came)

[Pre-Chorus]
How'd I get distracted, I
Don't know what happened, I
Turn back around and I was just one step too late
Oh you got, away, away, you flew away, away

[Bridge]
Oh Angel, tell me what am I to do?
Angel, I can't find another you
Angel search downtown, now I'm on the 10 West
Doing 90 tryna' get to you
Exit La Cienega, I'm looking, I'm searching
La Brea, Santa Monica, Sunset, Sepulveda
Robertson, Melrose and Hollywood

[Chorus]
I lost my Angel in L.A., L.A
(And where she at?)
Has anybody seen her?
I'm out here checking for my, Angel in L.A., L.A

[Chorus]
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

[Verse]
You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything

[Refrain]
So why on earth should I moan
Because when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeh

[Chorus]
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog

Will make me feel alright
Ah!

Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright
saturday I'll wake up in central london
stretched out lil low on serotonin
cus last night was extra’d out
place both knees on the ground
then ask god what he's talking about
before i kiss him on the mouth
God himself breathed in and out
last night i had a dream
Gyllenhaal on a mountain top
holding on two stone tablets with ten commandments
and a flower crown power couple propaganda phamplet
black panther and white panther you could run the jungles sleeping free on the tree branches no light pollution
look how slow all the life is moving once you get your heart racing
today if i survive i'll let my feet leave the ground
levitations and revelations
take me up in your rapture now

[Verse 1]
Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said, "Baby, can't you see"
I want to be famous, a star on the screen
But you can do something in between

[Chorus]
Baby you can drive my car
Yes, I'm going to be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you

[Verse 2]
I told that girl that my prospects were good
She said, "Baby, it's understood"
Working for peanuts is all very fine
But I can show you a better time

[Chorus]
Baby you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you

[Guitar Solo]
Beep beep beep beep yeah

[Chorus]
Baby you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you

[Verse 3]
I told that girl I can start right away
When she said, "Listen babe, I got something to say"
I got no car and it's breakin' my heart
But I've found a driver and that's a start

[Chorus]
Baby you can drive my car
Yes I'm gonna be a star (One day)
Baby you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you

[Outro]
Beep beep beep yeah
Beep beep beep beep yeah
Beep beep beep beep yeah
Beep beep beep beep yeah

[Bridge]
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there

[Chorus]
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

[Verse 1]
You didn't run, you didn't hide
You knew I wanted just to hold you
Had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again, for I had told you

[Chorus]
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day
Got to get you into my life

[Verse 2]
What can I do, what can I be
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there

[Chorus]
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life
Got to get you into my life

[Guitar Solo]
Got to get you into my life

[Bridge]
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there

[Chorus]
Then suddenly see you
Did I tell you I need you
Got to get you into my life

[Verse 1]
Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking 'til I can't go on?
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone

[Chorus]
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Verse 2]
Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight or say good night

[Chorus]
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Post-Chorus]
Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

[Verse 3]
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long

[Chorus]
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Post-Chorus]
Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

[Verse 4]
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long

[Chorus]
We can work it out
We can work it out

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 909

I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
You're only fooling 'round, only fooling 'round with me

Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 909

Said she's travelling on the one after 909

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, no one ever left alive in 1985 will ever do
She may be right, she may be fine
She may get love, but she won't get mine
'Cause I got you

[Chorus]
Oh, I
Oh, I
Well, I just can't get enough of that sweet stuff
My little lady gets behind

[Interlude]
Whoo!
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Give it up, give it up

[Verse]
Oh my mama said a time would come
When I would find myself in love with you
I didn't think, I never dreamed
That I would be around to see it all come true

[Chorus]
Oh, I
Oh, I
Well, I just can't get enough of that sweet stuff
My little lady gets behind

[Bridge]
Whoo whoo

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, no one ever left alive in 1985 will ever do
Well, she may be right, she may be fine
She may get love, but she won't get mine
Because I got you

[Chorus]
Oh, I
Oh, I
I just can't get enough of that sweet stuff
My little lady left behind (Yeah)

[Outro]
Yeah!
Say it a lil' freaky

[Hook]
What if it rained?
We didn't care
She said that someday soon
The sun was gonna shine
And she was right
This love of mine
My Valentine

As days and nights
Would pass me by
I tell myself that I was waiting for a sign
Then she appeared
A love so fine
My Valentine

And I will love her for life
And I will never let a day go by
Without remembering the reasons why
She makes me certain
That I can fly
And so I do
Without a care
I know that someday soon the sun is gonna shine
And she’ll be there
This love of mine
My Valentine

[Hook]
What if it rained?
We didn't care
She said that someday soon
The sun was gonna shine
And she was right
This love of mine
My Valentine

[Verse 1]
Come on baby now, let me look at you
Talk about yourself, try to tell the truth
I could stay up half the night, trying to crack your code
I could stay up half the night, but I'd rather hit the road

[Pre-Chorus]
On the night that I met you, I was on the town
On the night that I met you

[Chorus]
I just wanna know how you feel
Want a love that's so proud and real
You make me wanna go out and steal
I just want it fuh you, I just want it fuh you

[Verse 2]
Come on baby now, help me work it out
I won't let you down so you don't need to shout
I could stay up half the night, playing with your head
I could stay up half the night, but I'd rather go to bed

[Pre-Chorus]
On the night that I met you, I was on the town
On the night that I met you

[Chorus]
I just wanna know how you feel
Want a love that's so proud and real
You make me wanna go out and steal
I just want it fuh you, I just want it fuh you

[Bridge]
And everyday, in every way
And everyday, in every way

[Chorus]
I just wanna know how you feel
Want a love that's so proud and real
You make me wanna go out and steal
I just want it fuh you, I just want it fuh you
I just wanna know how you feel
Want a love that's so proud and real
You make me wanna go out and steal
I just want it fuh you, I just want it fuh you

[Verse 1]
I saw you flash a smile, that seemed to me to say
You wanted so much more than casual conversation
I swear I caught a look before you turned away
Now I don't see the point resisting your temptation

[Chorus]
If you come on to me, will I come on to you?
If you come on to me, will I come on to you? (Woo)

[Refrain]
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do-do-do, do

[Verse 2]
I don't think I can wait like I'm supposed to do
How soon can we arrange a simple introduction?
We need to find a place where we can be alone
To spend some special time without an interruption

[Chorus]
If you come on to me, will I come on to you?
If you come on to me, will I come on to you?

[Refrain]
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do-do-do, do (Everybody!)
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do-do-do, do

[Verse 3]
Before you grab your coat, I'll try to be discreet
You know we can't be seen exchanging information

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 4]
Well, I saw you flash a smile, that seemed to me to say
You wanted so much more than casual conversation

[Chorus]
If you come on to me, well I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, well I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, will I come on to you?
If you come on to me, will I come on to you?
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you

[Bridge]
Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will now
Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will now (Woo)

[Chorus]
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you

[Intro]
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh...
Meet me, meet me (Meet me)...

[Chorus]
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you wanna steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me, baby, in a safe place
C'mon, meet me in Electric Chapel

[Verse 1]
My body is sanctuary
My blood is pure
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
You want me bad
I think you're cool, but I'm not sure
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Follow me, don't be such a holy fool
Follow me, I need something more from you
It's not about sex or champagne, you holy fool
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Chorus]
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you wanna steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me, baby, in a safe place
C'mon, meet me in Electric Chapel

[Verse 2]
Confess to me, where you have been
Next to the bar
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Pray for your sins right under the glass disco ball
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Follow me, don't be such a holy fool
Follow me, I need something sacred from you
Together, we'll both find a way
To make a pure love work in a dirty way

[Chorus]
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you wanna steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me, baby, in a safe place
C'mon, meet me in Electric Chapel

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Meet me, meet me, baby, in a safe place
C'mon, meet me in Electric Chapel
Oh, oh

In Electric Chapel

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

[Verse 1]
No, I don't say it often
And I probably should’ve told you I hurt this bad, I know
And I probably shouldn't want this so bad
It's weighing, weighing on me
Don’t wanna wake up in the mornin'
Cannot undo what we did in this bed
And I can't get you out, so I gotta go
No, I'm not ready for, you want me all alone

[Chorus]
But I'm undecided, excited, ignited
And I don't wanna feel the way I do, but I like it
Look at all these sparks flying
But I'm still indecisive
And she want me to wife it
But I'm undecided

[Verse 2]
I know I shouldn’t be doing this, but here we go again
Girl, you know that pussy is my weakness (Weakness, weakness, weakness)
Girl, you got me addicted when you switching positions
You tell me, "Shut up"
And you know I listen, I hit it
Wish I never did it
I can’t keep sinning and pretending (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm taking off your clothes
We getting sexual
Hit it so good, think I’ll propose
I don't know but

[Chorus]
I'm undecided, excited (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah), ignited (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I don't wanna feel the way I do, but I like it
Look at all these sparks flying (All these, all these)
But I’m still indecisive ('Cause you want me)
And she want me to wife it
But I'm undecided

[Bridge]
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Oh, no, I'm undecided
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, yeah
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, I said I just don't know
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Ayy, 'cause I'm undecided
No, no, baby
I'm afraid of your love
Oh, ooh, you got me, baby
'Cause I can't get enough, oh, woah

[Chorus]
I'm undecided, excited (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah), ignited (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, huh)
And I don't wanna feel the way I do, but I like it
Look at all these sparks flying
But I'm still indecisive
And she want me to wife it
But I'm undecided

[Outro]
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
No, no, oh, no, and I want it (I'm undecided)
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, ayy
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, no, no, no, no
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Ooh, but I'm undecided

[Verse 1]
In the car, in the car, in the backseat, I'm your baby
We go fast, we go so fast, we don’t move
I believe in a place you take me
Make you real proud of your baby
In your car, I'm a star and I'm burnin’ through you
In your car, I'm a star and I'm burnin' through you

[Chorus]
Oh, be my once in a lifetime
Lyin' on your chest in my party dress
I'm a fuckin' mess, but I
Oh, thanks for the high life
Baby, it's the best, passed the test and yes
Now I’m here with you, and I
Would like to think that you would stick around
You know that I’d just die to make you proud
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song

[Verse 2]
Dream a dream, here's a scene
Touch me anywhere ’cause I'm your baby
Grab my waist, don't waste any part
I believe that you see me for who I am
So spill my clothes on the floor of your new car
Is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are?
Is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are?

[Chorus]
Oh, be my once in a lifetime
Lyin' on your chest in my party dress
I’m a fuckin' mess, but I
Oh, thanks for the high life
Baby, it's the best, passed the test and yes
Now I'm here with you, and I
Would like to think that you would stick around
You know that I'd just die to make you proud
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song

[Verse 1]
There was a time when we walked by the docks
And I told you, "I need you all of my life"
And watching the tugs rolling by together
Do you remember?
Do you remember the lights on the shore?
How they reflected the rain on the road?
I believed that you love me alone
It was real, do you remember?
Now and then, I see your face
I've been wanting a lovin’ embrace
I've been looking for love, but it gets me nowhere
Oh yeah, yeah (Uh)

[Chorus]
Get enough, get enough, get enough of (Your love, uh)
Get enough, get enough, get enough of (Your love)
I can't get enough of, of you

[Verse 2]
It was a time we were all full of hope
Saw the future burning bright
As we watched the moon rollin’ out to sea
Do you remember?
But those days are erased from my mind
Yeah, I've left all those old days behind
But still I remember your face forever, forever

[Chorus]
Get enough, get enough, get enough of (Your love, uh)
Get enough, get enough, get enough of (Your love)
I can't get enough of, of you

[Bridge]
Ooh
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
I think maybe I should go back to nature, traditional
And reexamine the art that you've ever seen, tried and traditional
I think it's time we all go together
We all want more

[Outro]
Get enough, get enough, get enough, girl
Get enough, get enough, get enough, girl
I can't get enough, enough of you

[Verse 1]
Out of sight now, baby
But you're still not out of mind, oh no
It's like you're right here with me
And all my worries fall aside, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
Planes, cars, and hotels have never been the same
Postcards and notes were, they're written in your name
Where did we go wrong
And how do we start again

[Chorus]
Where did we go wrong
And how do we start again
And how do we start again

How do we start again?

[Verse 2]
They tell me love is blind
But baby I can see it all, tonight
And when the sun goes down

[?] to be the 

[?]

[Pre-Chorus]
Planes, cars and hotels have never been the same
Postcards and notes were, they're written in your name
Where did we go wrong
And how do we start again

[Chorus]
Where did we go wrong
And how do we start again
And how do we start again

Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That’s just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That’s just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah

That Louis Burger never be the same (won't be the same)
A Louis belt will never ease that pain (won't ease that pain)
But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (that day is jerkin')
Pull off at Church's, with Pirellis skirtin' (Pirellis skirtin')
Gang signs out the window, ya bish (ya bish)
Hopin' all of 'em offend you, ya bish (ya bish)
They say your hood is a pot of gold (a pot of gold)
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home

[Verse 1]
Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I’ll never let you back to put it out

[Verse 2]
Your love feels so fake
And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out

[Chorus]
I’ll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Bridge]
When you call my name
Do you think I'll come runnin'?
You never did the same
So good at givin' me nothin'
When you close your eyes, do you picture me?
When you fantasize, am I your fantasy?
Now you know
Now I’m free

[Chorus]
I’ll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
I’d walk on cloven hoof if you were the home I was walking to
I’d burn every soul I knew if I thought the fire was warming you
I’d be what men fear in the woods
I’d piss on heaven’s gate if I could
I’m straight on the level
But I’d be the devil
As long as your lovin’ was good
MF DOOM ft. King Geedorah, Jet Jaguar, and Rodan - “No Snakes Alive (MF EP Version)”

[Emcee(s): King Geedorah, Jet Jaguar, and Rodan]

[Producer(s): MF DOOM (Original Instrumental from Metal Fingers - “Star Anis”)]

[Verse 1: King Geedorah]
Geedorah has arrived, you guys could take five
By the time it’s over, no snakes alive
Take the dive, I’m telling you, you’re better off
Then up against the flow that make her take her sweater off
From the setoff, when it came to scripts, he could hardly brag
It’s the result of concentration and lollygag
I said, “Yeah right.”  He pulled a mic out a snotty rag
Was sealed up air-tight, and tied up in a body bag
Get an advance and catch chance writer’s block.  After
Spending the first and last penny, my own worst enemy
Tell me if I’m OD and usual flow
And made deals with these cats who keep sending dough, so
The Three-Headed set it, never get busted
He’s a man of his word who’s yet to be trusted
Beats encrypted, multi-faceted, encrusted
Sweaty palm, keep mic rusted
Sort of mellow type of fellow
Who sometimes spaz on wife like Othello
Hell no.  He won’t use words like Illuminati
Or Gotti or shotty, he might use karate
Azar the Gaza caught cut, I’ll ask why
A mask with the ball-style caps saying, “That’s fly”
Exact dough ‘til it stack high
The white hoes, black guys, the rap game’s black eye

[Verse 2: Jet Jaguar]
Exhilaration, Jet Jag’s accelerations
Touch speeds minds can’t conceive
Achieve altered altitudes and angles, angels answer
Aura, illumination, awesome interpretation
Awkward alarm, ankle house arrest
Who’s best?  Monster Island Czars
Crush pawn dreams to be king
A frank reality, calculation could never be
Quest destined, distant competition dusted
Disgusted, race for second, crowded, clouded
Confusion, conclusion: simple, plain
Self-education, self-made millionaires
Serpents slithering, sidewinds searching
Stalking, heat-sensing, can’t have me
Jet Jag’s Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, superhero
Hit zero to sixty, hot pursuit, pedal to
The floor, handling
Lyrics, traction
Swerving left, right
Making head-fakes
Playing high stakes
Levitates
Quick!  Hit breaks, they fly past, hit wall, parts
Fly loose, killer mongoose

[Verse 3: Rodan]
Fake niggas continue to practice the art of intimidation
Sterile minds conceiving thought for artificial insemination
Syntax the sequence, arranging lessons so deliberate, making
Wise words clear, but population stay illiterate
Consider it.  Gods refine power, fools get rid of it, men build
Dreams on promises but lacking the will to deliver it
Yo, I dissolve connivers like saliva on tic-tacs gone
Astray, but get the job done like socks that’s mismatched
Flip tracks, murder snakes, drunk niggas killing six packs
Choking on venom, suffering tricknological kickbacks
Poverty-stricken minds with thoughts barely worth two cents
Build history through time, linear design on blueprints
A nuisance lies in disguise, Eighty-Five Percent never knew
Wise men arise and pull files like Internal Revenue
Forever true, opposing self-evidence with leverage
Upset the beast belly, concoct homogenized beverage
Clever shit, calculated sabotage, Trojan Horse
Giftwrapped ambush, lethal energy in motion that grows in force
Trojan swords strategically aligned throughout the underworld
God of Elevation kill Superman, rape Wondergirl
Fictitious character decapitated, fake beings susceptible
To everyday occurrence, a fatal outcome’s inevitable

[Verse 4: King Geedorah]
Might as well join the force
Boss.  Chance?  Take a loss like a coin-toss
Roll with a double-headed nickel
While the partner Jet Jag with the sickle, you in a pickle
King Geedorah, your ass needs to leave him alone
‘Fore he cold-catch a seizure and then you’re blown
If he ain’t the best, he’s the best in
The top three out of myself, I, and me

[Verse 1]
We sit in the car
Outside your house
I can feel the heat comin' round
I go to put my arm around you and you
Give me a look like I'm way out of bounds
Well you let out one of your bored sighs and
Lately when I look into your eyes

[Chorus]
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down

[Verse 2]
We get dressed up
And we go
Out - baby for the night
We come home early burning -
Burning for some fire fight
I'm sick and tired of you setting me up, yeah
Setting me up just to knock, knock, knocking me down

[Chorus]
Down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down

[Verse 3]
I pull you close, but when we
Kiss - I can feel a doubt
I remember back when we started
My kisses used to turn you inside out

I used to drive you to work in the morning
Friday night I'd drive you all around
You used to love to drive me wild but
Lately girl you get your kicks from just driving me

[Chorus]
Down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down

[Outro]
Oh, darling I'm going down
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down

[Hook:]
Drop that kitty down low

Shop that like a window

[Chorus]
Walking on the ceiling
'Cause life is the ground
Jaxing

[?] all my neighbors

Taking off my braces
'Cause I can't sit around
Shitting on the neighbors

I've been trying to get it

Jaxing

[?] all my neighbors
I'm just passing
I'm just passing through
Ready to move
I'm ready to move

[Verse 1]
I've been to Paris, made my way down to Rome
Seen the sun setting on the beach in Mexico
But I could care less, 'cause I was all alone
And there ain't no way to touch your body over the phone

[Chorus]
I've been all around the world, done all there is to do
But you'll always be the home I wanna come home to
You're a wild night with a hell of a view
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you

[Verse 2]
You're my daybreak, you're my California sun
You're my Memphis, New York, New Orleans all rolled into one
In the city, the country, the mountains or sea
Wherever you are, baby, that's where I wanna be

[Chorus]
I've been all around the world, done all there is to do
But you'll always be the home I wanna come home to
You're a wild night with a hell of a view
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you, no

[Bridge]
There ain't no place (No place, no place)
Ooh, yeah, ain't no place
Wherever you are, baby, that's where I wanna be

[Chorus]
I've been all around the world, done all there is to do
But you'll always be the home I wanna come home to
You're a wild night with a hell of a view
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you
Said there ain't no place, ain't no place like you, yeah

[Outro]
There ain't no place (No place, no place)
No place
There ain't no place like
No place like you
No place, no place, no place, no place
There ain't no place, no place like you
Rosie Watson introduces herself by saying her son inherited "the gift of the gab" from her. And she comes correct; within moments, a stream of stories, pearls of wisdom, life lessons and mottos flow freely, with a cadence and rhythm that's almost song-like. Born in Louisiana, raised in LA, she's the devoted mother of Frank's good friend Jonathan. Rosie refers to Frank (aka "Lonny") as her nephew, and is also called "Auntie" by the likes of Syd the Kid and Tyler the Creator.

"With Lonny," Rosie recalls, "he had that drive towards being successful. And certainly they spent enough time in Sydney's studio to make a lot good music together, and they did. I was a lot more worried about Tyler. I remember chasing him around the house saying 'Tyler, I think you're crazy, I think there's something seriously wrong with you.' And I remember Lonny was there and said, 'Auntie Rosie, let me get this clip!' I said, 'You better not!'" She laughs. "I had curlers all in my hair. And he wanted to get this on film!"

With a big heart and warm personality, Rosie's quick to take others on as her own, and give Frank the same maternal care and advice that Jonathan reaps, as heard on 'Not Just Money' and interlude on Channel Orange. she also has a particular flair for voicemails: She makes another guest appearance on the new album, with a voicemail that warns of flesh-eating bacteria that's roaming rampant on college campuses.

Sat in an IHOP where the waitress knows how she takes her coffee (extra hot for the first cup), Rosie comes here often to study, currently in graduate school for Psychology and Therapy. Though she can chat for days, she's an equally good listener, and an acute observer, the result of 27 years working as a probation/parole officer in Los Angeles. Dressed superfly, with a sharp sense of style (due to her daily routine she calls "prep before you primp") Rosie brings us into her world and tells it how it is.

Interviewer: How did Frank and Jonathan meet?

Rosie: They met through Eddie and Raymond, they are also my nephews. And then Jonathan introduced Lonny to Sydney. That's how they came together, musically and creatively. They would meet at Sydney's house in high school, and they would compose music. And they just loved it; they just had a wonderful time. And I stayed on Lonny: "Lonny, get my son home by curfew!" I made him five me his cell phone number, and I would fuss at him. I kept him running for sure.

Interviewer: Your voicemails are stuff of legends. What do you love about leaving people messages?

Rosie: I think when you call someone, you should leave a voicemail for them. But with my son, I do leave voicemails for him, I'll often leave inspirational voicemails. Sometimes I leave nasty voicemails too! And I'll leave nasty voicemails for Lonny too, when the timing is right! I want them to always remember to just be themselves, they don't have to be the type of man described in a rap song. They don't have to be balling, they don't have to be ballers, they don't have to be shot callers. I leave voicemails for my son in particular because I want my son to remain optimistic. I want him to know that his mother has his back, no matter what. I want Lonny to also know that Auntie Rosie is here for him.

Interviewer: What's the last advice you gave to Frank?

Rosie: When I last saw him, he came by the house, and he was in this beautiful...Porsche I think it was? Sedan? It was gorgeous. And I said, 'Remember in life, you have to have both swagger and sway. With swagger alone, you're convincing yourself that you have something that you really may not have, and that others don't see in you. sway is knowing what to do with that swagger. Sway is influence. It's persuasion, and I shortened it to sway. You have to believe in yourself, but you also have to impart that confidence in such a away that you convince other people to believe in you, and take a chance on you. In life you've got to have both swagger and sway. Remember that.' He laughed and said, 'Okay Auntie, I'll remember that.' And I said, 'By the way I am going to trademark that statement! It's a Rosie original.'

Interviewer: Are you into cars as well?
Rosie: I really do love cars. I drive a 2006 Chevy HHR, and I love that little care. That's the longest I've ever kept a car. Normally I would keep a car for only two years, because I love different cars. Although now I have a KIA Optima, which I'd bought for my son to drive when he was in college. KIA and Hyundai are sister companies, and I find they make very good vehicles. As a matter of fact, the car that Rodney King, black in 1992, outran the police in was a Hyundai. Imagine - this funny looking black man, in this this funny sounding car, outruns the police. You know that made them angry! So even then in 92, the Hyundai was a very good car. It was very fast. I love cars. I have to wash and vacuum my car every week, because somehow I see the car as an extension of me. They seem to drive better when they're clean! There was a commercial - I believe it was for Cadillac - and it said "when you turn your car on it should do the same for you." I also owned a Cadillac, an Escalade, several years ago. And my motto was: "When you in a Cadillac, you know where you in a Cadillac, you know where you're at." They're wonderful cars.

Interviewer: What was your favorite ever car?

Rosie: I would say my Chevy Camero. I was younger of course, it was red, it was fast. Of course I appreciate the Pinto that my mother made my sister hand down to me, I think it was a '74 Pinto. But the Camero was the car that I bought for myself; it was my first brand new car. And it lasted: I had over 100,000 miles on that car.

Interviewer: What are your thoughts on social media and the younger generation?

Rosie: I do believe that they are, in many ways, in a good place. I believe that social media is a medium by which they do communicate with one another, and also become activists in many ways. It truly is an opportunity for activism. However I also do believe that it can also be very destructive in the sense that it can derail their focus. Forms of social media are potentially very addictive. And they can consume too much of your time to the point that you are too concerned with what other people think about you. I do believe that people that use it have to know how to use it, and hot to limit its  use.
Sometimes I'd hear my son laughing in his room, so I'd walk in his room and say, "What's so funny? What are you laughing about?" And he would say, "Mom, I'm talking to my friends." And I'd say, "You're not talking to your friends, you are typing to them." I would go and get the house phone and bring it to him and say, "Here. Call them. Hear their voices." I also told him this: "Do not ever ask a girl for a date through text." If a guy ever asked me for a date on a text, I would probably text back something very unkind, with an exclamation point!

Interviewer: Do you use social media yourself?

Rosie: I don't know how to Tweet. No, let me say this - I sent a tweet  a couple of years ago, maybe a year and a half ago, to MC Hammer. Somehow I got a tweet from MC Hammer, and I tweeted back to him somehow in my reply! That was my one and only time. He had been arrested by the police - it was profiling. I said to MC Hammer, "Remember this. The lesson that's to be learned is the police officer's lesson to learn. It is his lesson to learn that not all black men are thugs, and that you can't judge a book by its cover." Actually there's one thing I'd like to be able to use social media for! With Micheal Brown having been killed in Ferguson Missouri, there's one tweet I would love to send out. I believe that this jury is not going to come back with an indictment of Darren Wilson. I believe that so much time is elapsing now over this entire case, I believe there's a lot of corruption going on in the investigation of this case. One Tweet I would like to hear the crowd shout out is: "We know about the wait, they're getting their lives straight!" I would love to have someone tweet it for me and say, "Auntie Rosie said that you all need to shout this out!" I believe that they are delaying the investigation of this case because they're getting the stories straight. So - we know about the wait, they're getting their lies straight. Although I'm a peace officer myself, I believe that we have to respect people, we have to be respectful to their rights, we cannot become so intoxicated with our own power that we in fact think that we own the world and we run it, and everyone else is just a guest. We have to stay in our place too; we have to stay in our lane.

Interviewer: What's some advice you'd give someone reading this magazine>

Rosie: Don't confuse stability with stagnation. In life you want to move towards stability. The stability is what you want in your family life, it's what you want in your job and career. Don't look for excitement in everything you do; we have to be able to live and contend with boredom. But that doesn't mean that you're stagnated. Remain inspired throughout life, curious, moving forward. We should not be afraid to risk, to take a risk. We should have courage.

Interviewer: What's the best advice someone gave you?

Rosie: I remember the encouraging words of my mother, who would always say - the sky is the limit. Her life was certainly not an easy life, being a black woman coming from the south. She raised five children on her own because my father also passed away, when I was a little girl. So my mother raised five children on her own, cooking and cleaning houses for other people. She did not have a formal education but she was one of the smartest people I knew. She was very bright, Very intelligent, and she always imparted optimism in us to do our very best.

Interviewer: What's important to you, in becoming a therapist/psychologist?

Rosie: As a therapist, and as a clinical psychologist, we are the agents of change. I believe that we should never give up on life. We certainly are all interconnected in life, and we all need each other, regardless of our race, creed, color, regardless of our nationality. My life - and how I interact with people - is not a zero sum game, in the sense that my gains are not your losses, my losses are not your gains. I feel that my gains can help you win, and your gains can help me win. And so we all need help from one another.

[Verse 1]
Jump on a plane, I go to Dubai
Balenci' my kicks, this nigga too fly
Porsche Panamera, I trap out America
I see the man when I look in the mirror
When I drip in the VIP, all the girls stare
Eliante when I put on my earring (Water)
I fell in love with my jewelry (Water)
Hop in Bugatti, I'm steering
I'm on a private jet, leering
I put hundred racks in Amiri's
She say my name, I appear
I'm sippin' on lean not beer (Lean)

[Chorus]
A hundred racks in my Amiri's
A hundred racks in my Amiri's
A hundred racks in my Amiri's
A hundred racks in my Amiri's

A hundred racks in my Amiri's
A hundred racks in my Amiri's
A hundred racks in my Amiri's

[Verse 2]
Hop on a plane, I go to Dubai
Whippin' that dope, you know I'm too fly
Watch out the bullets, they hittin' your eye
Slime, trap out the condo
I got the water, that H2O
Yeah, trap out the studio
We sippin' lean, no Julio
Got the bands, them benjamins
All of my niggas, we get it in
I'm sippin' on lean, not Ritalin
I fuck with the plug, not the middleman
I stack up the cash, the dividend
Whip up the dope, and it tasting like cinnamon
Pop a Percocet, I'm feelin' like limitless
Jump in Bugatti, skrrt off with the back end

[Chorus]
A hundred racks in my Amiri's
A hundred racks in my Amiri's
A hundred racks in my Amiri's
A hundred racks in my Amiri's
A hundred racks in my Amiri's
A hundred racks in my Amiri's

[Verse 1]
Who's that shadow holding me hostage?
I've been here for days
Who's this whisper telling me that I'm never gonna get away?
I know they'll be coming to find me soon
But I fear I'm getting used to
Being held by you

[Chorus:]
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, look what you've done now
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, you've got me tied down
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh

[Verse 2]
Who's this man that's holding your hand
And talking about your eyes?
Used to sing about being free but now he's changed his mind
I know they'll be coming to find me soon
But my Stockholm syndrome is in your room
Yeah, I fell for you

[Chorus:]
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, look what you've done now
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, you've got me tied down
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh

[Bridge]
All my life I've been on my own
I use the light to guide me home
But now together we're alone
And there's no other place I'd ever wanna go
Baby, look what you've done
(Look what you've done to me)

[Chorus:]
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, look what you've done now
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, you've got me tied down
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh

[Verse 1: Stevie Nicks & Harry Styles]
I took my love, I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
'Till the landslide brought me down
Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

[Chorus: Stevie Nicks and Harry Styles and Stevie Nicks]
Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And I'm getting older too
Yes, I'm getting older too

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus: Stevie Nicks and Harry Styles and Stevie Nicks]
Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And I'm getting older too
Yes, I'm getting older too

[Outro: Stevie Nicks & Stevie Nicks and Harry Styles]
Oh, take my love, take it down
Oh, climb a mountain and turn around
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well the landslide will bring it down, down
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well the landslide will bring it down, oh oh
The landslide will bring it down

[Verse 1]
Punctured bicycle
On a hillside desolate
Will Nature make a man of me yet?
When in this charming car
This charming man
Why pamper life's complexities
When the leather runs smooth on the passenger seat?

[Chorus]
I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, "It's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care"

[Verse 2]
A jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said, "Return the rings"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things

[Chorus]
I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, "It's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care"

[Bridge]
Naaa nana nana nana
This charming man
Naaa nana nana nana
This charming man

[Verse 3]
A jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said, "Return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear

[Chorus]
I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear

[Bridge]
Naaa nana nana nana
This charming man
Naaa nana nana nana
This charming man

[Verse 3]
A jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said, "Return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things

Frank Ocean: What do you think, or suppose, was before everything?

Christopher Chassol: (laughs) So basically you're asking me..., what I think? I think everything is possible. I think it can be whatever you decide to be; whatever you choose.

FO: Chris, what the fuck are you talking about? you don't understand the question.

CC: The question is what do I think there was before the Big Bang. So  I think you can decide whatever you want because we have no clue. We are not astrophysicists; they get religious at the end.

Om'Mas Keith: And this is why there will always be a God principle/ When you get to the point where you can't explain everything, the human soul needs to find something because we can't accept not knowing. I'm a scientist. Everything I fuck with has been proven. That's like everything in my life.

CC: Really? Proven?

OK: Right, maths and science. It's like, this shit is real! Only in business and creating though. In love there's no rules. In love, you'll never know anything. Business can definitely know things. You can look at statistics in love and all that shit too,  but you'll always derive the fact that you'll never be able to predict anything. I think in business you can use models to predict outcomes. More so that in love.

FO: Wo have you guys gotten the best commentary on yourselves from? Has it been your enemies or your loved ones?

CC: Well it's my girl, of course. I do music to please girls, you know? At the beginning you do it for her to love me, because I want to shine in front of her.

OK: Like a diamond.

CC: I'm doing music for her to feel proud of me.
FO: You know that song, "shine bright like a diamond?" You don't know that song?

CC: No, it's from a movie? I don't know? Maybe-maybe - it's a girl? Like Miley Cyrus? I don't know I'm not an entertainer.

OK: My mother used to always say weird shit to us, basically saying like we were a very select group of people in the hood who had some consciousness and were trying to get out. And she would always make those weird statements to reinforce that, I don't even want to repeat what she said because it doesn't sound good. Basically, telling me that I should rise above what was going on in the neighbourhood. To this day, just how ambiguous your parents or elders around you can be, my mother, my grandmother, they'd always say stuff like 'you're from here, but you're not of here.' Just a repeated mantra, always. 'Each one, teach one.' so when I talk to my mom it's all these paraphrases and lessons. When I talk to my grandmother , it's always this wisdom. Everybody older than me are the ones who really give me the commentary as I move forward.

CC: When we were talking, I was thinking of echoes in your life or phrases that people say when you are young... Phrases that stay. Short ones that constitute your vision. There was one guy, I was 20 and in a band. I was good, but I was not super good. The guy was and older guy in a bar. He said, 'Yeah, pretty good, your concert, but you don't have the sound.' I was really pissed off. I knew he was right and this phrase - I don't even know who this guy is, I met him ten seconds - but this phrase stayed to remind me that I'm not there.

OK: I had one guy do that. This is a pivotal moment in my beat-making life. I was 16, I made these beasts and prepared them for this gentleman called Weldon Irvine who was a famous jazz musician. He came to my house, listened to my beats, and I knew they were great but he shot me down, like 'yeah they're a little busy bro.' It was my first shit of honesty that prepared me for what was going to come for the rest of my life. I always go back to that one scenario of people having that one opinion. You can let it destroy you, you have to add it to your repertoire and think about it. When he said that, I thought to myself, maybe there's a way to do things simple. I'm still on a quest for that to this day in my life, that level of simplicity, because of this interaction with Weldon.

FO: When I used to sing when I was younger, my mom would be like, 'stop hollering!' It used to make me all self-conscious about how I sounded, like my tone of voice or how loud I was, and I didn't want to sound like I was dying and shit. And then I discovered Prince at my mom's friend Jheri's house, I mean she used to have him on like everyday and I honestly didn't pay attention at first but I vividly remember the first time I heard 'Beautiful Ones' and this grown man singing for his life. Immediately I remember it clicking like , 'oh, it's okay to holler and scream and everything. Like, express yourself kid... Go off! So yeah, Prince basically made it all okay. (Laughter) And I mean there was other stuff like my grandfather always correcting my speech, which was a regular thing. But for some reason I remember I was picking up a habit of saying, 'yes, indeed.' And like really stretching it out too which sounded country as hell. I think I was picking it up from my older twin cousins or whatever and he wasn't having it, at all. Low-key I think he's the reason why I never picked up a strong New Orleans accent for real, which I kind if wish I did. I guess I could turn it on if I tried to but yea in general I probably just sound like I'm from anywhere in America.

OK: Talking like black people, what does it mean?

FO: Yeah, I heard that growing up sometimes. 'Oh, you talk white.' But you know what it means though.

OK: In the context that I grew up when I was told to talk white it was becuase I took the time to make sure everybody understood every word and used big words.

CC: It's about putting the white guy on the side of the intellect and putting the black guy on the side of the intuitive, primitive things. 'Oh, his language swings.' (snaps fingers). 'It's close to dance. Close to the animals, to nature!' The white  guys speaks clearly like the brain. It's doing this when people say 'talking like white people' and 'talking like black people.' It's so stupid.

OK: That's at the core. So why are people still doing that right now? Still! In fifth grade saying to another kid, 'Why you talk black?' Why you talk white? Wigger!'

FO: True. But it's all changing all the time. There'll be new cultures that collide like this in the future and this will be old news.

OK: Do you like being alone?
CC: Yeah, I love it.

OK I hate being alone. I love to have so many people around me, much as I can. I like to have people sleeping in my house.

CC: I like my toilet. I need my space.

OK: No, everything's separate. You can't use my toilet. (laughs) I like an environment where I'm in my world and there are people in the house, I don't know what it's about, but I like having people around me. I like entourage. I think I'm going to have a big entourage, really big.

FO: I'm not that way.

OK: You can be alone, huh?

FO: Yeah. I can be alone. But remember I used to have a bunch of people around my house all the time. All the time.

OK: Trusted crew, though?

FO: Eh, some randoms too.

CC: And people staying over and they wouldn't leave?

FO: Some people wouldn't leave, they'd just be there.

CC: So you're like 'so. so..' (claps hands on knees)'  'what are we doing?'

OK: Do people do this at your flat?
CC: Yeah, they stay because the place is good. So I'm like 'So so so... I have to work... blah blah blah.' They won't leave! Being alone is good. With this, the invention of the iPod, it changed everything. You have all things, all of this music everywhere. The Proustrian feeling, the feeling of nostalgia, you can bring nostalgia in a place where you have never experienced it before. You had Walkmans but the iPod changed everything.

OK: Data revival. That's what brings those feelings. Seeing it, it gives you unlimited... It's like fucking drugs, man.

CC: I love good nostalgia. Nostalgia that goes for a while. It's crazy when music is so powerful. It can still be technical and poetic, like 'I know which chord makes me feel about Wednesday afternoon in 1983.' Think like that. You could almost make an Excel document about it.

OK: Take for instance, every time I hear 'Don't Forget About Me' from the Breakfast Club. Whenever I immediately hear that song, I get this immediate image of being; because the only time I saw this movie was on WPIX11 

[news] in syndication and it would come on Saturdays once every three months or something like that... But I always remember catching it at home on a Saturday, 11 years old. It takes me right back to that time, every time.

Zing Tsejeng: Do you think people are mostalgic these days?

OK: I don't know.

CC: No, I don't think so.

[Verse 1]
Upon the sand, upon the bay
"There is a quick and easy way" you say
Before you illustrate
I'd rather state
I’m not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am

[Chorus]
And sorrow's native son
He will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
Oh...

[Verse 2]
End of the pier, end of the bay
You tug my arm, and say "give in to lust
Give up to lust, oh heaven knows we’ll
Soon be dust... "
Oh, I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am

[Chorus]
And sorrow's native son
He will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
(Oh, really?)
Oh...

[Verse 3]
I could have been wild and I could have been free
But nature played this trick on me
She wants it now
And she will not wait
But she's too rough
And I'm too delicate
Then, on the sand
Another man, he takes her hand
A smile lights up her face
And well, it would
I lost my faith in womanhood
I lost my faith in womanhood
I lost my faith...

[Outro]
Oh...
Hand in glove...
The sun shines out of our behinds...
Oh...

[Intro]
Sittin' on a star, thinking how I'm not a star
I can't call it, dog (yo, aye)
Sittin' on a star, thinking how I'm not a star
Just can't call it, dog

[Hook]
Aye, keep pace, my nigga (Keep pace, my nigga)
"Be safe" she said, my nigga
Keep faith, my nigga, (Yeah yeah) ah
Me safe, she safe, keep pace, my nigga (Keep faith)

[Verse]
Peace to every crease on your brain
Peace to who came before me in the game
We givin' praise and glory to your name, kid
We cellophane your story so it stays
Since birth mama raised and burped me, I ain't changed
I'm a man, I'm just saying that I stayed imperfect
Earl is not my name, the world is my domain, kid
Air Max 97, creps on the pavement
Hair got knotty, let it settle on my face, I
I've been eating good you can see it in my tummy
But I'm buggin', I've been spending more money than I'm making
Stuck in Trump Land, watching subtlety decayin'
I ain't touch a xan, when it-
When it's time to put my burnt body in a case
Tell my momma I said thank you
Tryna state facts, I'm tryna get through the day
I'ma play it back, I ain't into showing face, kid
It's been a minute since I heard applause
It's been a minute since you seen or heard from me, I've been swerving calls
It's been a minute since I heard applause
Sittin' on a star, thinking how I'm not a star
I can't call it, dogs

[Bridge]
Sometimes I feel like I wanna call it off
I can't call it, dogs
Big dog, finna rip the collar off, uh
Sittin' on a star, thinking how I'm not a star
I can't call it, dogs (yo, aye)
Sittin' on a star, thinking how I'm not a star
Just can't call it, dogs

[Hook]
Aye, keep pace, my nigga (Keep pace, my nigga)
"Be safe" she said, my nigga
Keep faith, my nigga, (Yeah yeah) ah
Me safe, she safe, keep pace, my nigga (Keep faith)

[Outro]
Sittin' on a star, thinking how I'm not a star
Just can't call it, dog

You look a little lonely
Maybe I could meet you

We're looking at the menu

[Chorus]
Lord, I can't believe my eyes, I must be dreaming
Give me your number, I'll give you a ring

[Bridge]
Oh man, I know I won't be lonely anymore (lonely anymore)
Me and my phone, I'm gonna call your home
I won't be lonely any more (lonely anymore)

[Verse 1]
You look a little lonely
Maybe I could meet you
Tell me where to reach you
And I'll give you a ring

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'll take you to the pictures
Miss the second feature

[Chorus]
Lord, I can't believe my eyes, I must be dreaming
Give me your number, I'll give you a ring
Give me your number, I'll give you a ring

[Bridge]
Oh man, I know I won't be lonely anymore (lonely anymore)
Me and my phone, I'm gonna call your home
I won't be lonely any more (lonely anymore)

[Verse 3]
You look a little sleepy
Wanna go to bed, dear?
Tell me can wed, dear
I'll give you a ring

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Take you to the chapel
Listen to the sermon

[Chorus]
Lord, I can't believe my ears, I must be dreaming
Give me your number, I'll give you a ring

[Outro]
Give me your number, I'll give you a ring
Give me your number, I'll give you a ring

(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
I never learn my lesson so I always do it twice
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
They say it's bad karma when you live a double life
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)

[Chorus: Joan Jett, Miley Cyrus & Both]
Oh, they say it's bad karma being such a heartbreaker

Even them alphabet boys can't stop a nigga
I pimp tight with that hoe off in the wind, boy
I gets loose like I'm fresh up out that pen, boy
The last of a dying breed like 'Pac said
I got bread, got something that'll cock it
My ambitions as a rider by Slip-n-Slide, uh
All them killers down south know I'm on fire
28's chrome, fuck a hundred, smoke 

[?]
I know you pimp tight, pimpin', but I pimp tighter
Getting bread, got it made like Special Ed
Them hollow tips at your head, bitch, I bet you dead
24's on the Wagon, that's that G Benz
Two 44's looking like Siamese twins

[Chorus: Duece Poppi]

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
See, I'ma get this money
Rich everywhere and however it goes
And let me tell you something
If you owe me money, might as well owe the double-yo
So see, JAY-Z and JD might have told you money ain't a thing
But that means money's everything and for that money y'all make, them choppers sing
I'll make them coppers bring
That yellow tape 'cause the whole thing
Can turn into a homicide scene if you fuck with the cream, mane
And I know Trick
And I know his click
But I let you slip, I let you slide
But I hope you motherfuckers don't think I'ma let you die
Surprise, Pitbull get the last laugh
And whoever laughs last laughs the hardest
Whether now or later, y'all gonna pay me back regardless

[Interlude: Pitbull]
And y'all can take THAT to the bank, motherfuckers

[Chorus: Duece Poppi]

[Verse 3: Plies]
Nigga, I'm from down here where everything fucked up
And every other month, the dope prices going up
And either you thugging down here or you in the church
'Cause how I'm living, ain't nothing like you see on BET
These crackers found five dead in the last week
So if you a pussy nigga, you better get the fuck out these streets
These young niggas 16 and 17 going Fed
These crackers hitting these young niggas with 20-year bids
How the fuck you get indicted? You never had a quarter brick
But down here, that's how these pussy crackers play shit
And where I'm from, we respect Chevys more than we do Bentleys
'Cause a motherfucking Bentley can't fit them 26's
And that money come a little faster out here in the south
We got the corner, nigga, and got our own dope house
And you can find me with a white tee with my pants dropped
With four at the bottom, pussy nigga, and four at the top

[Chorus: Duece Poppi]
When you're from down south, boy
Down south, boy
Way, way, way deep down south, boy
When you're from down south, boy
Down south, boy
Way, way, way deep down south, boy
When you're from down south, boy
Down south, boy
Way, way, way deep down south, boy
When you're from down south, boy
Down south, boy
Way, way, way deep down south, boy

[Intro: Beyoncé]:
Baby
Seems like everywhere I go, I see you
From your eyes, your smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly, I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you

[JAY-Z & Beyoncé]:
Yes!
So crazy right now
Most incredibly
It's your girl, B

You ready?
Band, one two three four!
Geah!
History in the making, part two!
It's so crazy right now

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can
(Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now) Sing!
(Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now) Sing!

Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now) C'mon!

Got me looking so crazy in love) Here we go

(Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no)

When I talk to my friends so quietly
("Who he think he is?") Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

(Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now) So crazy
(Got me looking so crazy right now) Your love
(Your love's got me looking so crazy right now) Hey! He-he-hey
(Got me hoping you'll page me right now) Heyeah
(Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now)
(Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love) I'm looking so crazy in love, hey

[JAY-Z]:
Uh huh, gimme that, yeah, yeah

Ain't no tellin' when I'm fuckin' with this
Messin' they be yellin', I'ma pimp by blood
Don't be late, Shawn
Y'all weak shit done

Jump up Chris, mommy on E
Can't keep her little model hands off me
Both in the club, I'm singing off-key
And I, and I, uh, uh
It gets better, order another round
It's about to go down
Six model chicks, six bottles of Cris
For till the end, got the beat everywhere
What do you say? Me, you, and the club, we classless
We go back, spade, so we discuss fashion
Like Prada blouse, Gucci
Take that off

[Beyoncé]:
'Kay, blow your horn now
Give it up for Jay R

Never really felt bad about it

'Cause I felt melting magnets, babe
The second I saw you through half-shut eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Lorde]
Smoke and sunset, off Mulholland
He was talking, I was wonderin' 'bout
You and that girl, she your girlfriend?
Face from heaven, bet the world she don't know, know
Pretty girls don't know the things that I know, know, know
Walk my way, I'll share the things that she won't

[Chorus: Lorde]
Uh-oh, dancing past the point of no return
Let go, we can free ourselves of all we've learned
I love this secret language that we're speakin'
Say it to me, let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no return

[Instrumental Break: A-Trak]

[Intro: Snoop Dogg, Too $hort, will.i.am & Fergie]

Hanging out my nigga, my nerve, DJ Drama in the motherfucking house
For the two-thousand plus, three times two, plus one
Add that shit up nigga
My nigga $hort Dog in the house
My nigga will.i.am in the house
Suh— Snoop Dogg's in the house
We— We— West coast make 'em bounce, bounce
It makes me wanna bounce

DJ Skee

[Verse: Snoop Dogg]
Get loose, get wild, now get set
Yeah, it's the anthem, nigga, it's the shit
You can get crunk, get hyphy, get fit
You can bounce like you're hoppin' over a motherfuckin' fence
If you in the whip, ghostride the bitch
Slip into the liquor sto' sippin' on a fifth
Yeah, nigga, bring in the bag
Gangbang on you motherfuckers claimin' the flag
West coast, nigga, I'm a real go-getter
Forty ounce sipper, the black Jack Tripper (Dramatic)
20 Cripper, 10-to-1 I flip her
Got the hook-up on the birds and the motherfuckin' zippers
Go to the club with my thugs, sell drugs
And I might get a girl but I ain't gon' tip her
Get mo' liquor, spit mo' slicker
Put your hands in the air, motherfucker, it's a stick up
Nah, nigga, eat a dick up
You say you a pimp, but you in love with a stripper
Just bounce to the beat and don't pay me no attention
Just bounce to the beat, bounce, bounce to the beat

[Outro: Will.i.am & Too $hort]

What's up, though, my nigga? (My nigga, what's up?)
What's up, cuz?

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I got a hundred thousand niggas with me
And the motherfuckin' police still fucking with me
But I don't give a fuck, nigga, come and deal with me
I'm acting stupid silly, my lil' bitch from Philly
She sent a nigga 20 G's, cheese through the mail
And now I'm fillin' up with L's, gotta keep a lawyer just in case you niggas tell
Probably squeal, nigga, probably will
Polly want a cracker, nigga, Polly wanna tell (Snitch)
I come from Poly High, nigga, where we rip and ride
And bust niggas, when we bust, it's a four-five
Right to your D-I-Z-ome
Click-clack, bang-bang, you're gone
I got homies that live on the hillside
And got killers that kill that live on the real side (Yeah)

[Chorus: J-Black & Snoop Dogg]
When cuz roll deeper than a motherfucka
Look around, look around (Look around, y'all)
When catch 'em sleeping, they got heaters
Look around, look around (Look around, y'all)
When cuz roll deeper than a motherfucka
Look around, look around (Look around, y'all)
When catch 'em sleeping, they got heaters
Look around, look around

[Refrain: J-Black]
You niggas better act right
'Cause all of mine are right here
(Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?)
(Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?)
Look around, look around
Yeah, you niggas better act right
'Cause all of mine are right here
(Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?)
(Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?)
Look around look around

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
You did it, shit it and fell back in it
Disrespect the set, now I gotta represent it
Yeah, motherfucker, I said and I meant it
Concentrated, convicted, crooked cops, they contemplate it
Tried to catch a nigga slippin', I had some bitches with me
I kept it Crippin', me and Whitney had to move swiftly
Onto the next song, we had to press on
I'm preachin' and teachin', nigga, learn this lesson
Me and my niggas, we be deep when we in the streets
Most likely on the creep, tryna find some freaks
Take 'em to the crib, lay 'em in between the sheets
And kick 'em out and talk bad 'bout them on these beats
I'ma tell you, cuz, see, it's a crazy world
And now you in the club kissin' on baby girl
You see them niggas there, they represent this here
So I suggest you shut the fuck up and disappear (Yeah)

[Chorus: J-Black & Snoop Dogg]
When cuz roll deeper than a motherfucka
Look around, look around (Look around, y'all)
When catch 'em sleeping, they got heaters
Look around, look around (Look around, y'all)
When cuz roll deeper than a motherfucka
Look around, look around (Look around, y'all)
When catch 'em sleeping, they got heaters
Look around, look around

[Refrain: J-Black]
You niggas better act right
'Cause all of mine are right here
(Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?)
(Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?)
Look around, look around
Yeah, you niggas better act right
'Cause all of mine are right here
(Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?)
(Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?)
Look around look around

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Snoop Dogg, I'm a hell of a man
I got a carload of gangstas in this caravan
See them my niggas, I take care of 'em, man
Buying oils from them boys over there in Iran
And now the US nation, I mean the US hatin'
See, 'cause they know a nigga stackin' while he paper chasin'
And showing niggas how to get it, but legitimate
No more crumbs for you bums, fuck a little bit
We want the whole pot, and nigga, why not?
I guess another Black leader gotta get shot
Before y'all recognize, but I'ma wake you up
Shake you up, take my time, take you up, cake you up
And break bread with you
Feed you, fed you, chop game with you
And put you on a real team
'Cause rolling with Snoop Dogg, that's the American dream
You know what I mean? You know what I mean?

[Intro]

And they wanna know how I feel about the governor

But his teachings and doctrines is wat I'ma spread

And I love feeding those, who wanna be fed
So stand in line and get your tickets
Ain't no wine and no bread
It's just lines and new rhymes about the crimes that I did
If u doin it big, u gotta handle yo biz, and in the memory of

For those unaware that means I'm calm under pressure

We got just some niggas from the LBC
Fuck a nigga up quick

And do a couple of licks, till I stack me some bricks
And we will not quit, until we see fit

[Verse 3]
I had a stripper used to tip her her name was chanelle
She used to bring me money when I was locked up in jail
And when I got out, I was goin wit her everywhere
She understood me girl yeah she was wat a player
I didn't have to press it; never eva had to stress it
And every time I think about it, damn it’s a blessin'
And I'm confessin', and I’m addressin'
All the ladies who love to love a real man
Do ya damn thang, don't be embarrassed
That's the truest form of love when it's at its purest
Don't have to second guess it, cuz tha S N double O
Is lookin 4 a real woman, not no ditty hoe

Booty like a soccer ball, ooh, and I just gotta score it

Let me get that apple and I'll give you this banana
Drop it on my wood, up and down like a hammer
Bedroom gettin' steamy, shawty hot like the Savannah
Desert, Desert
Damn!

[Verse]
Trap out the Demon
Trap out the Hellcat
Walk in the mall and I spend me a hundred racks
That nigga start it, but Soulja Boy finished it
If I go spend it, you know I'ma make it back
Mini Draco on me, you know it'll spray you flat
Poppin' two pills, now I'm feelin' like limitless
Ride in a foreign, I used to ride spinnin less
Poppin' a pill, I feel like I'm Ritalin
I'm fuckin' your bitch, does that solve your mystery?
Young Drako my name, you know I made history
M (Million)  is a lot to you, but it ain't shit to me
Run up on gang, you know I'm leaving you 6 feet
Open the back door, nigga go creep-creep
I'm fuckin' your bitch, you know she a freak-freak
Bands'll make her dance, RiRi
Young Drako my name, I know they remember me
How you acting like you a friend of me?
Cock back the pistol, I shoot at my enemies
When one of these pussy ass rap niggas gonna come finish me?
Smoking on dope, I feel like I'm fishing
VVS plug, I don't fuck with middlemen
Who is this nigga, I never heard of him
Hop in the Lamborghini, then I swerve on them
Smoking on cream, I'm sippin' on purple
Young nigga geeked up, like Urkel
VVS diamond my water, Squirtle
I'm in your bitch, just like a 

[?]

[?] orders
I got them bricks, that ship cross the border
I hit the Mexico, I jump the wall
Living my best life, just like Duval
I got this shit from LA, out of New York
Smell like a pound when I'm up in court
Ballin' so I'm hard, like I'm on a court
Flexin' on these broke niggas like it's a sport
Lambo to 

[?], they know who I am
Pop out with Draco, that chopper go blam
Catch me if you can, like Gingerbread Man
Riding 'round town with a hundred and fifty bands
Rollin' up green, gas, Shrek
Pourin' up red, blood, Hi-Tech
Try to finesse me, you know you get wet
Shout out my squad, shout out my set
Try to rob, we leaving a mess
This is not school, so nigga don't test
Cuban the link and it sit on my neck
Back in High School, I was serving that crack
Sippin' on lean, I think I need a doctor
Back in High School, I had M's sittin' in my locker

[?] you got it
That ain't shit, I got racks in my pocket
Young Drako, nigga took off like a rocket
Young rich nigga, fly as a cockpit
Say he get money, fuckboy stop it
Stack up an M, gettin' money my hobby
Made me an M, they think I'm 'Luminati
Cop a hotel, then nigga run 'round in the lobby
Every time that I drop, they go cop it
Fuckin' your bitch, now she giving me sloppy
Jump out the Demon, I feel like the GOAT
Two-two-three bullets, they hit at your throat
I kept on servin' and trappin', young nigga I'm bold
VVS diamond, my necklace in gold
Stand in the kitchen, that strap with a pole, my elbows
Came a long way from rockin' them shell toes
Young Drako, nigga I was strapped like velcro
Cookin' that crack with my wrist in a circle

[?] like bow and an arrow
Covered in gold, they callin' me Pharoah
Cuban the link and I used to rock 

[?]
Pourin' Hi-Tech, drop a deuce in my styrofoam

[Chorus]
When I was older
I was a sailor on an open sea
But now I'm underwater
And my skin is paler than it should ever be
Hmm

[Verse]
I'm on my back again
Dreaming of a time and place
Where you and I remain the best of friends
Even after all this ends
Can we pretend?
I'm on my, I'm on my back again
It's seeming more and more
Like all we ever do is see how far it bends
Before it breaks in half and then
We bend it back again

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess I got caught in the middle of it
Yes I've been taught, got a little of it
In my blood, in my blood
Memories burn like a forest fire
Heavy rain turns any funeral pyre to mud
In the flood

[Chorus]
When I was older
I was a sailor on an open sea
But now I'm underwater
And my skin is paler than it should ever be

[Bridge]
I'm watching movies back to back in black and white, I never
Seen anybody do it like I do it any better
Been goin' over you, I'm overdue for new endeavors
Nobody lonely like I'm lonely and I don't know whether
You'd really like it in the limelight
You'd sympathize with all the bad guys
I'm still a victim in my own right
But I'm the villain in my own eyes, yeah

[Outro]
When I was older
I was a sailor on an open sea

[Intro: Aminé]
Yeah, you know I'm back in the building
Yeah, where did you think I went?
I didn't go nowhere, I'm still, I'm-I'm right here
Yeah man, yeah you know it's-it's been cool
The sun has been shining
You know what I mean, how 'bout you?
I don't give a fuck, look

[Verse 1: Aminé]
Westside baby, PDX made me
503 'til I D-I- (You know)
Ain't shit sweet but the pussy I eat
And you know I'm in this bitch like a IUD (Yee)
I'm the dude that your girl told you not to worry 'bout (True)
Now I'm your house with my legs on the couch (True)
Face pointed south so her ass wanna bounce (Hey)
Shawty give me head when I respect her
So I get head all the time (Hey)
That's why I'm ahead of the time (Hey)
My verse is priceless, my touch is Midas
Unknown New Zealand, my chains from Iceland (Hey) (Period)
Reel it in, tell a friend
Aminé got the juice and I'm always gon' sin (Yeah)
After school with it like a nigga Dom Kennedy (Yeah)
Smoke big dope just to take away the pain in me
I'm a grown ass man
Pussy ass niggas can't stop my plans (Nah)
No handouts, I don't need no hand (Nah)
Your girl walked in said "Play my jam" (Play my jam)
I ain't Timberlake but I make your feelings ache (True)
Girls twerk and sing to the shit I make (Yee)
I wonder why she don't like a nigga like me (Hey)
Maybe she does but her pride too mighty

[Chorus: Aminé]
I'm not sure what I see
Cupid don't fuck with me
Are you telling me this is a sign? (Wait is this a sign?)
She's looking in my eyes
I don't see no other guys (No)
Are you telling me this is a sign? (Wait is this a sign?)

[Interlude: Aminé]
Oh my god, that's hard
Woah!

[Verse 2: Aminé]
I'm too jaded, walls keep caving
Might say I'm good but I got two faces
Feels so basic, hard to say this
I like a girl that dance like honey
And always 'bout it, 'bout it
But she 'bout that money

[Outro: Unknown Mortal Orchestra & Aminé]
Hunnybee, Hunnybee
There's no such thing
As sweeter a sting
Hunnybee, Hunnybee
There's no such thing
As sweeter a sting
Hunnybee, Hunnybee
There's no such thing
As sweeter a sting (Uh huh, uh huh)
Hunnybee (Yeah), Hunnybee
There's no such thing (Yeah yeah)
As sweeter a sting

[Intro]
Let's just, let's ju-
Let's just do this and quit acting like
We ain't got life
Let's just do this, let's just do this
(It's the remix, baby)

[Chorus]
She likes my diamonds and my pearls
I said, "Thanks, my girl designed it"
Aminé might just steal your girl
If you call me Trey Songz, I don't mind it
Try it, West Side nigga, I am
Liking, the way that you move
The way that you move
It's the way that you move

[Verse]
I'm on South Beach, tryna leave, high as hell, need vacancy
Got a flight that I gotta catch so sober up for security
You know TSA don't play
These rappers get the PJ but they don't make PJ weigh
It's sad cause it's so fake
My nigga, why you fucking your commas up? (Mmm)
Spending a grand on lunch
You gon' be broke with that kinda stuff
You ain't even bought your mama shit
But you gotta spend 'cause you wanna look rich
This LA living got you changin'
You out here shinin' on these niggas like you stainless
You out here ballin' on these niggas, Calvin Cambridge
Ayy, tell me, is this life you live worth it?
Does the ice you rock make you painless?

[Outro]
She likes my diamonds and my pearls
I said, "Thanks my girl designed it"

[Verse 1]
I woke up today
With an aching pain
And I couldn't shake it
I tried to ease the pain
With a bottle of booze
But it wouldn’t do it
I ran, ran to the store
To grab some medicine to soothe it
But all, all that it did
Was wipe the memory of you babe

[Chorus]
And I can't be good to you
But I wanna be good to you

[Verse 2]
Oh, the weather is gonna change
In a few months, babe
And all, all of this snow
Will melt into the yard
And I cleaned off my sheets for
I just need your loving
I cleaned off my sheets for
I just need your loving

[Chorus]
But I can't be good to you
But I wanna be good to you

[Outro]
She’s smilin' right at me and I feel it in my knees but
I don't wanna trust no one
She's smilin' right at me and I feel it in my knees but
I don't wanna trust no one
She's climbin' right at me and I’ve kept it in my teeth, oh
I don’t wanna trust no one

London bye, ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye, ta-ta
Brought me down
Don't like your new face
That's not fair
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta

[VERSE 1]
Gigi, Gigi
Take me away
Gigi, Gigi
Take me today
The pirates in the clothes shop
Sold me curry for a pound
His cardboard face is soggy
And he’s selling thorny crowns
I loved her!
I loved her!
I've got to get away now
But I loved her!

[REFRAIN]
London bye, ta-ta
Strange young town

[VERSE 2]
Red light, green light
Make up your mind
Red light, green light
You're much too unkind
Your right hand makes a sermon
And the contents of your wallet
With all the paint is prime to dry
Your left hand hides its bullet
I loved her, I loved her
I’d like to get away now, but I loved her

[REFRAIN]
London bye, ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye, ta-ta
Brought me down
Don't like your new face
That's not fair
Got to go far, far

Do, do do do do
Do, do do do do

[VERSE 3]
Sweep down, sweep down
Take my advice

[?]
She loves to love all beauty
And she says the norm is funny
But she whimpers in the morning
When she finds she has no money
I loved her!
Yeah, I loved her!
I've got to get away now
But I loved her!

[REFRAIN]
London bye, ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye, ta-ta
Brought me down
Don't like your new face

[VERSE 1]
Dozing bumble, get off her shoulder
She wants to be still, she wants to feel older
Sunshine, shadows soften her hair
Our fingertips touch, she wants to feel older
We’re citizens of town lying in a country field
Gazing down upon her face
Suddenly we're lovers

[REFRAIN]
Your briefcase prince is by your side
To kiss away the dew
Angel angel grubby face, I love you
It's thirteen miles to Factory Street
The train is going soon
Angel angel grubby face, I love you
Do you love me?

[VERSE 2]
Sunday, oak tree, sing me a song
The couples of town are lost in your branches
Monday morning, buses and smoke
Workshop encounter, disorder and vouchers
Our city clothes offend your leaves
Your naked sky demands the reason why we lie beneath the shade
Because we love each other

[REFRAIN]
Your briefcase prince is by your side
To kiss away to the dew
Angel angel grubby face, I love you

Don't forget my name

[VERSE 1]
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I’m stepping through the door
And I’m floating in the most peculiar way
Can I please get back inside now, if I may?

[HOOK]
For here am I floating ‘round my tin can
Far above the world
Planet earth is blue and there’s nothing I can do

[GUITAR BREAK]

[VERSE 2]
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much, she knows

Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows what I must do
And I think my life on earth is nearly through

[VERSE 3]
Ground Control to Major Tom
You’re off your course, direction's wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you-

[HOOK]
Here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the moon
Planet earth is blue and there’s nothing I can do
Do, do do do
John Hutchinson: Nice, nice
David Bowie: Didn’t sound nice to me. Let’s remember to do that. Ok, Hutch
(Begins playing)
DB: Ope, hun. Yeah?
JH: What a single!
DB: We’re recording, now. Wait, Christie, don’t talk

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills
And put your helmet on
(Ten) Ground Control (Nine) to Major Tom (Eight)
(Seven, six) Commencing (Five) countdown
Engines on (Four, three, two)
Check ignition (One)
And may God's love (Blast off) be with you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much, she knows
Though I'm passed 100,000 miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship know what I must do
And I think my life on earth is nearly through

[Verse 3]
Ground Control to Major Tom
You're off your course, direction's wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you-

Here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the Moon
The planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Morse code for "SOS"]

[Verse: Drake]
All they do is PR double-E me like I'm Dolph
They say "holy" when they see the chain, that's not a cross
Put the owl on it, you can never take it off

[Chorus: Quavo]
When they see the chain, yeah, they know it’s Ratatouille (yeah)
She say I'm in South Africa I make a movie (yeah)
White McLaren let the wings up and show the Uzi
Drizzy got Baka off with a not guilty

[Intro]
It's spring and the cherry blossoms sprout
The legs are out and the bronzed chests
And fires bejeweling the southwest
Thank you, darling, for these silver gelatin echoes of me, with you
Smiling like he has to for the cause
For the tribe, for the boys, for the lie

[Verse 1]
Nobody heard me crying in my sleep
Me and the men of the frontier stack the bodies in a heap
Jimmy grabs a beer and we wash our hands in the creek
Ooh, talk is cheap
Frangipanis growing back home
And they're shading the bottle-o line
Once we were dreaming of pearls
Now me and my sons all dream of iron

[Chorus]
Well, Daisy, baby, are you drivin' home?
'Cause this baby doesn't wanna walk alone
She said "Ooh" as she grabbed my tongue
Sometimes you gotta rock the cradle, baby, on your own

[Verse 2]
Ooh, is that boogoo with the big chain?
Is that Annie with the white dress?
Is that granny with the white man
With the no name and the no stress?
Like, what about the empire? What about the cross?
What about the halos? Are the angels inside with the Xbox?
Ooh, that's a dollar for any can
And on Thursdays, I'll be headin' back to see my man

[Chorus]
Well, Daisy, baby, are you drivin' home?
'Cause this baby doesn't wanna walk alone
She said "Ooh" as she grabbed my tongue
Sometimes you gotta rock the cradle, baby, on your own

[Bridge]
Damn, it's cool on the bathroom floor
Well, Daisy doesn't have a babe no more
Damn, it's cool on the bathroom floor
Daisy doesn't have a babe no more

[Outro]
Did seeing real blood remind you that I had a heart?
That was the last kiss, that was a real one
When I see you next year I'll be perfect, yeah
I'll be perfect for you, babe

[Verse 1]
Hey, ain't you clever to be loaded in?
Pursed lips and exploded
I heard a click and noted, I froze and floated
Just to check in how my gums have eroded
You didn't look like you were joking
When you said you're into choking
Well, I guess if we're not smoking
Then you gotta get your kicks
Well, I gave what I had to give, with 48 hours in Tel-Aviv
Seems these kids just wanna live and let live
So take my love and get your kicks with it

[Chorus]
I might, I might go shack up in Tasmania
Before the ozone goes
And paradise burns in Australia
Who knows? Who knows?

[Verse 2]
Good luck with the service
I know you don't deserve this
By the time I've heard this,​ I'll be far, far
Just another antipodean
But to Americans, I'm an alien
Dyed his hair again
How could I know where I've been
When I don't know who I am?

[Chorus]
I might, I might go shack up in Tasmania
Before the ozone goes
And paradise burns in Australia
Who knows? Who knows?

[Bridge]
I wanna breathe, I wanna breathe real air again
I wanna go back, wanna go back
I wanna breathe, I wanna breathe

[Outro]
I left my phone in Sydney
'Cause all the stress outdid me
Should I be worried 'bout my kidney or worried 'bout war?

[Verse 1]
Back in early '96 in North West Australia
I wonder why you were lyin' on the street alone
Another accident inflicted on an innocent child
In the home, while I was on the see-saw
I was in the garden, readin' Papillon
Tellin' myself real people couldn't be so cruel

[Pre-Chorus]
And she said, "Honey, what's wrong?"
I said, "Babe, what's right?"
So we staggered off into the night, oh
I'm lucky, I'm lucky, I'm lucky just to sleep at night, oh
So we linked arms and we staggered off into the night
Drunk, but overjoyed just to be employed

[Chorus]
By the boys
The boys are killin' me
I'm just a sailor and a miner
I'm comin' as I am, comin' as I am
Even if you tell me I'm a liar
The boys are killin' me
I'm just a sailor and a miner
Mantajarra Walyakarra
Take a deep breath and hold your fire

[Verse 2]
Gesticulating wildly and passionate at cars
Parked in the dark on the street, oh
I would've fallen in a hole
If you didn't have my shoulders tight
You're swaying like a see-saw
If that's what it is to trust another, then you got it all
But I don't know if I can trust my country anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "Honey, what's wrong?"
I said, "Babe, what's right?"
So we staggered off into the night
Drunk, but overjoyed just to be employed

[Chorus]
By the boys
The boys are killin' me
I'm just a sailor and a miner
I'm comin' as I am, comin' as I am
Even if you tell me I'm a liar
The boys are killin' me
I'm just a sailor and a miner
Mantajarra Walyakarra
Take a deep breath and hold your fire

[Verse 1]
So you got political, can you speak on that?
I didn't get political, I just faced the facts
Is it critical we react?
Just don't slap me on the back
I'm not the one for whom leaving the house is a political act

[Chorus]
Honey, kiss me, I don't care
If you've got a cold
It's just a nightmare
So young but so old

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm no hero, just do my hand mouth dance
For the actual heroes, dying to get the kids to France
Silenced by their class, silenced by their caste
And if you're not a bloke, then here's the fucking joke
You'll be silenced by our past

[Chorus]
Honey, kiss me, I don't care
If you don't comb your hair
Or if your world is strange
And I can't share your pain

[Verse 1]
Sleep, sleep for a while
Now that you've seen me and you've done it in style
Rest now, it's over, mon ami
Lord, I hope you've forgiven me
From wherever you are, you were a star
We all come from the stars, return to stars
We hung out in bars for days
Now I'm done with Pigalle

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Every day, I wake miles away
Hoping today's my day
Living in fear, same old voice in my ear
End to a real good year
Helplessly detained, overstayed
Guessing I can't complain
Wish you were here, change of atmosphere
I'll just wait with baited breath
And dream I'm on the frontier

[Outro]
Sleep, you can sleep my friend
Now that you've seen the end, how does it feel?
Sleep, you can sleep my friend
Now that you've seen the end, how does it feel?
Sleep, you can sleep my friend
Now that you've seen the end, how does it feel?
Sleep, you can sleep my friend
Now that you've seen the end, how does it feel?
Sleep, you can sleep my friend
Now that you've seen the end, how does it feel?

[Verse 1]
Well, I hope you're in the olive grove, yeah
And I hope you're not alone
Was I awoken by some presentiment, or was that a gun?
It was probably just a cracker
It was probably just a cracker, it's the 14th of July
In Montreuil it matters that someone died

[Chorus]
Split me open and burn me in two
Or roll me in the summer dew
I don't want to hate Marseille just because of this one day
So hurry up and rain, complete my day
In shame, shame
Shame
Shame, shame
Oh, in shame, oh

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm sorry for everything we've done
I'm sorry for the glory of the queen, the glory of the gun
I'm sorry, I don't know what else to say
So what do I do? To whom do I pray?
To reserve my lot, to reserve my place
Well, I don't even like to think too much about fate
Does that make me fatalist, or naturalist?
Is it ignorance? Wait, wait

[Chorus]
Split me open and burn me in two
Or roll me in the summer dew
I don't want to hate Marseille just because of this one day
So hurry up and rain, complete my day
In shame, shame
Shame
Shame, shame
Oh, in shame, oh
In the early morning, just out of sight
There's a bird that’s flying from left to right
A new tree is growing, there's due that bites
There's a kite that’s flying higher in the sky
There's a breeze that's blowing, the doctor's here alright
The surf's getting rougher now, but we can swim alright
But don't be defeated, by the coming night
By the wind that's blowing, as cold as ice

[Verse 1]
Young hearts runnin' free, oh yeah
Young love has gotta bleed, oh
Who took a little too much speed
And fucked their guts up and their teeth?
Oh, now that's done, proceed
As final days and shadows loom
We all hold hands and prepare the tomb
Bowed, bowed before the womb
Men fear power and call it sin
And from this flower, we all begin
In the red, red room

[Chorus]
(Selené) Now you can bleed on me
Now you can bleed on me, yeah
(Selené) Your body pressed, babe
To my chest, babe
We're together so fuck the rest, babe
Now you can bleed on me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Love your skin, holds your organs in
Though it holds away from you
Selené and her mortal king
We got more to do

[Chorus]
(Selené) Now you can bleed on me
Now you can bleed on me, yeah
(Selené) Your body pressed, babe
To my chest, babe
We're together so fuck the rest, babe
Now you can bleed on me

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
(Selené) Now you can bleed on me
Now you can bleed on me, yeah
(Selené) Your body pressed, babe
To my chest, babe
We're together so fuck the rest, babe
Now you can bleed on me, yeah

[Verse 1]
Any other day, I would call, you would say
"Baby, how's your day?"
But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is "uh-huh". “yeah ok"
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
That I am not the one to sit around, and be played
So prove yourself to me, I'm the girl that you claim
Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you say that I am assuming things
(Something's going down that's the way it seems)
Shouldn't be the reason that you're acting strange
(Nobody's holding you back from me)
I know how you usually do
(Saying everything to me times two)
Why don't you just tell the truth?
(Somebody's there then tell me who)

[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
You ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?

[Verse 2]
What is up with this?
Tell the truth, who you with?
How would you like it if I came over with my clique?
Don't try to change it now, saying you gotta bounce
When two seconds ago, you said you just got in the house

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you say that I am assuming things
(Something's going down that's the way it seems)
Shouldn't be the reason that you're acting strange
(Nobody's holding you back from me)
I know how you usually do
(Saying everything to me times two)
Why don't you just tell the truth?
(Somebody's there then tell me who)

[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
You ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?

[Bridge]
Say my name
Say my name
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say my name
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say my name
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
When no one is around you
Say baby I love you
(Say my name)
Say my name, say my name
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You actin' kinda shady
You ain't callin' me baby
(Say my name)
Why the sudden change?

[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name
No one is around you
Say baby I love you
(Say my name)
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
You ain't callin' me baby
(Say my name)
Why the sudden change?
No one is around you
Say baby I love you
(Say my name)
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
You ain't callin' me baby
(Say my name)
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
No one is around you
Say baby I love you
(Say my name)
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
You ain't callin' me baby
(Say my name)
Honey, say my name

[Verse 1]
I still watch you when you're groovin'
As if through water from the bottom of a pool
You're movin' without movin'
And when you move, I'm moved
You are a call to motion
There, all of you a verb in perfect view
Like Jonah on the ocean
When you move, I'm moved

[Pre-Chorus]
When you move
I'm put to mind of all that I wanna be
When you move
I could never define all that you are to me

[Chorus]
So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby

[Verse 2]
You are the rite of movement
Its reasonin' made lucid and cool
I know it's no improvement
When you move, I move
You're S. Polunin leapin'
Or Fred Astaire in sequins
Honey, you, you're Atlas in his sleepin'
And when you move, I'm moved

[Pre-Chorus]
When you move
I can recall somethin' that's gone from me
When you move
Honey, I'm put in awe of somethin' so flawed and free

[Chorus]
So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to lose
And nothing to prove
Move me, baby

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh baby, oh baby
Move like grey skies
Move like a bird of paradise
Move like an odd sight come out at night

[Chorus]
Move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
Move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to lose
And nothing to prove
Move me, baby
Move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby

[Intro]
Uh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Paranoid and pissed off
Now that I got the money
Fifty acres and a model A
Right in the middle of Trump country
I told you, "There goes a neighborhood"
Now Mister Williams ain't so funny
I see you looking out your window
Can’t wait to call the police on me

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I know you think I'm up to somethin'
I’m just eating, now we're still hungry
And this is mine now, legit
I ain't leavin' and you can't take it from me
I remember when you used to tell me

[Chorus]
"Nigga run, nigga run
Go back where you come from, uh
Nigga run, nigga run
Go back where you come from
We don't want, we don't want your kind
We think you's a dog born"
Fuck you, I’m America’s son
This is where I come from

[Post-Chorus]
This land is mine
This land is mine
This land is mine
This land is mine

[Verse 2]
Up 'til the sun comes up
No, I can’t start grindin'
And I can't let 'em break me
No, I can’t let 'em fire me
You can meet my friend the governor
Only if you wanna try me
Or you can meet my other friend, the judge
Just in case you think I'm lyin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I know you think I'm up to somethin'
I'm just eating, now we're still hungry
And this is mine now, legit

[Verse 1: Khalid]
Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus: Khalid]
All the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Verse 2: Kane Brown]
Saturday nights, your works shoes are stilettos
Smell of cheap perfume
Makeup on your face, try to hide the pain
All the lies, they look like the truth
Deep in your heart, all you want is love
But you never felt good enough
You got wrapped up in other plans
But this ain't the way the story ends

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus: Khalid & Kane Brown]
All the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Bridge: Khalid & Kane Brown]
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
'Cause I care (I care), I care about you

There's nowhere I'd rather be

[Chorus: Kane Brown, Kane Brown & Khalid,]
With all the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care about you the way that I do, oh
All the things that I know that your parents don't
Don't care about you the way that I, the way that I do
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
The way that I do (Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
The way that I do (Do-do-do)

You beat me up, broke me down
Pieces of me scattered all around
I'm black and blue
Black and blue

[Verse 2: Mac Davis]
How'd I ever wind up here in this smokey hotel?
Neon blinking through the curtains and I'm hurtin' like hell

I'm black and blue
Black and blue

[Verse 3: Aloe Blacc]

And I reach for you and you vanish in thin air
Couldn't take time to say goodbye
Ripped out my heart and left me here to die
I'm black and blue
Black and blue

So here I am looking down at the cold city lights
Just another pair of eyes in the darkness tonight
You took everything that I had to give

To show that I ain't no motherfuckin’ joke

But the guard sent his ass directly
Yo, to his G-R-A-V-E
Bein' stupid try to P-L-A-Y me
Yo, listen well to me
Spell it to the underground
Nobody playin' pussy
So I’m layin' it down
A little somethin' from the motherfuckin' D.R.E

Well, I'm your type for real, you know the hype is real
You know my situation, you got these bitches hatin' (Hating, hating)

Told you go provoke it 'cause I see it
I could feel it, and you need it, baby

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Let me take my time (Let me take my time)
I won't waste (I won't waste), I won't waste
Let me take my time (Said, let me take it, let me take it)
Workin' it so good, baby (Workin' it so)
Hurtin' it so good, baby (Hurtin' it so)
Let me take my time (Said, let me take my time)
I can't wait for it (I just can't wait), I can't wait for it
Let me take my time (Let me take my time)
'Cause I can't wait, I can't wait

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
I really hope you never ever get to love me
I'm thinkin' of all the times that you dubbed me
Now that I'm poppin', you got me right where I wanna
Right where I wanted to be when you would love me
Caught you slippin' in LIV and sippin' bubbly
You took a look at these niggas, ain't none above me
I tried to give you my heart, but girl, you don't know
I tried to show you affection, but no, it won't show
I told you, "Baby, just wait, we need some time and all"
I told you just love me, give me some time to ball
The way you lookin' is like a thousand dollars
With my confidence, took every ounce to holler
I really hope you never get to love me
I wanna be somewhere stuntin', sippin' on bubbly
Not even a thought of you in my mind
Visions of you went blind
Ooh, you used to call just to tell me
That you ain't all the way get it, but, girl, you felt me
Part of that reason why I always try to tell you
You held it down, I'ma get you the bag with the Chanel C's
'Cause it was us against the world, fuck what they tell me
I figured they was hatin' on us and it was jealousy
But I should've listened to the shit they was tellin' me
I thought you was takin' a W, it was just an L on me
Now I'm caught up in this situation where L-O-V got the best of me
I'm tryna find somethin', tryna align somethin'
Still hopin' and prayin' that you'll be my somethin'
Out layin', and hopin' prayin' that you done datin' me
I know I treat you better than your man, yeah, fuck that nigga
Tryna treat you better than he can

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
I know you that you ain't really 'bout to dub me
I know you wanna tell me that you love me
Girl, I know you wanna ride it like a Harley
Know you wanna let me swim in that tsunami
Swear I never felt like this way 'bout nobody
Swear I never felt this way 'bout nobody
Girl, you got me doing things that's just not me
Sprung over you, girl, I cannot be
Girl, I know some things have changed (Things have changed)
But you see, you and me, we still a thing (Oh)
I can't get you out my mind, girl
You know you've been actin' out of line, girl
Don't say, "Not today," 'cause today I got the time, girl
I been actin' like I'm fine, girl
Goin' insane, losin' my brain
You playin' these games, but you know I ain't
I don't be trippin' off bitches, this strange
Not to call you out your name, you know you my main
Man, fuck this fame
How they came in our world, changed everything?
Right away, in a day
Niggas hate, bitches hate
Niggas fake, bitches fake

[Interlude]
Hey, look at him, man
I hope he doesn't hurt you too bad

[Refrain: Trey Songz]
Girl, I know some things have changed (Things have changed)
But you see, you and me, we still a thing (Oh)

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
Really, baby, you should never get to love me
Pillow talkin' with niggas and tryna dub me
You really got the audacity to discuss me
You really got some audacity, you disgust me
And it'd kill me to say these things about you but
I know the way you think about the two of us
I know the way you think about movin' on
But me, girl, I'm not used to maneuverin' much
Tell me I'm doin' enough
Tell me I'm doin' too much
Tell me that you've been in love
Girl, you not doin' enough
I threw the towel in twenty times, I threw it too much
Baby, this shit been a lot
Plus you've been doin' enough
You can't lie, you got time
You heard stories about my drip
Why does it take for me to do somethin' good
For you to come around? That's why I drift
And I know (Know), you's a pro (Pro)
Known for heartbreak after the sheets
I'm tryna keep my composure, I'm a soldier
And deep down, I'm still a G, so (Yeah)

[Outro: Tory Lanez & Trey Songz]
I'm gon' raise my glass to this (Raise it up)
Fly back to Los Angeles (Back to Hollywood)
Won't forget you were scandalous (Won't forget)
Won't forget you were scandalous, yeah (No)
I'm gon' raise my glass to this (Raise it up)
Fly back to Los Angeles (Fly on back)
Won't forget you were scandalous (Won't forget)
Won't forget you were scandalous, yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
I'm the type of person to get carried away
Been this way since I came out of the womb
A bit obsessive, got that all for me, yeah
Yeah, and God knows I do not like to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want your love, I want your love
I'ma do whatever it takes
And I want your love, I want your love

Need to get my hands on all of it, all, a-all
I'm passionate
I can't help it, I need to get my hands on all of it
Need to get my hands on all of it, all, a-all

[Verse 2]
I never listen to the voice in my head
You know, it's like I got no brakes in my car (I never listen to it)
I'm on a mission, gonna sleep when I'm dead
And it's impossible to stop when I start

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want your love (I want your love), I want your love
I'ma do whatever it takes (Oh, oh, oh)
And I want your love (I want your love), I want your love
I know I come on hard, there's no need to be alarmed
It's just I'm...

[Chorus]
Passionate
I can't help it, I need to get my hands on all of it
Need to get my hands on all of it, all, a-all (Oh)
I'm passionate
I can't help it, I need to get my hands on all of it
Need to get my hands on all of it, all, a-all

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I'm so passionate

[Bridge]
All I want is everything
Too much adrenaline
And all I'll do is anything
But like a gentleman
Singin', all I want is everything
Too much adrenaline
And all I'll do is anything
But like a gentleman

[Chorus]
Passionate
I can't help it, I need to get my hands on all of it
Need to get my hands on all of it, all, a-all
I'm passionate
I can't help it, I need to get my hands on all of it (Oh, oh, oh)
Need to get my hands on all of it, all, a-all (Ooh)

[Verse 1]
Just memorizing lines upon your face
I made a map, every photo and the details on the frames
And just last night we spilled red wine, how it stained the floor
And though I know that nothing ever really stays the same, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, if I could stop the hands of that clock
Never let 'em tick, tick, tick
Wherever I go, yeah, I would still know
Even though it's selfish

[Chorus]
I don't wanna share you with no one else, no one else
I can't compare you to no one else, no one else
'Cause people change and memories fade
But could you stay the same, if nothing else?
No, I don't wanna share you with no one else, nobody else

[Verse 2]
Torn by the way your voice is changing on the phone
All this space in between us makes it hard to feel close to you (Close to you)
And just last night I had some red wine and it brought me back
No matter what I'll remember you forever like that, you know (Like that, you know)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, if I could stop the hands of that clock
And never let 'em tick, tick, tick
Wherever I go, yeah, I would still know

[Verse 1]
Used to heatin' up in the shower, at it for hours
Now you’re always in a rush
I could be paranoid, but I swear, it's up in the air
Are you fallin' out of love?
The more I think about how we were, the more that I’m sure
Sure it wasn't what it was, yeah
We used to be, used to be better (Used to be better)
We used to talk about growing old, now I don't know
If we gon' make it through the month
Don't wanna make it real if it's not, I wish I could stop
With over-overthinking us, yeah
Feelin' like there's nowhere to go, it’s taking a toll
I don’t wanna give you up
But we used to be, used to be better

[Chorus]
Is it just me or did our talks get a little bit shorter?
Is it just me or did the nights get a little bit colder?
When that argument got vulgar
When it should've just blown over
It was nothing, nothing

[Post-Chorus]
Is it just, just me? (Ooh)
Is it just, just me? (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
It’s 2 A.M., you're not even home, I'm here alone
Callin', but your phone is off
You go and blame it all on your friends, not that again
Need to know what’s going on, 'cause
The more I think about how we were, the more that I'm sure
Sure I'm not the only one, yeah
We used to be, used to be better

[Pre-Chorus]
Never forget, night that we met, you had another one
You did it then, you'd do it again, now I'm the other one

[Chorus]
Is it just me or did our talks get a little bit shorter?
Is it just me or did the nights get a little bit colder?
When that argument got vulgar
When it should've just blown over
It was nothing, nothing

Is it just, just me? (Ooh)
Is it just, just me? (Ooh)

[Bridge]
Never forget, night that we met, you had another one

[Chorus]
Is it just me or (Just me, baby)
Did our talks get a little bit shorter?
Is it just me or (Just me, baby)
Did the night get a little bit colder?
When that argument got vulgar
When it should've just blown over
It was nothing, nothing (Oh)

[Post-Chorus]
Is it just, just me?
(Oh, is it just me?)
Oh, is it just, just me?

Is it just, just me?
(I been waiting for you, baby, until now)

[Outro]
Is it just me? Is it, is it?
Is it just me? Is it, is it?

[Verse 1]
You kiss a little different now
You changed your hair, I like it now
And baby, your body still feels the same
And soon I'll be lying on the floor, picking up the pieces
Drinking it away, pretending I don't need ya
But right now, I'ma hold you like nothing has changed

[Chorus]
I'm going crazy over you (Hey, hey, hey, hey, over you)
Over you again, yeah (Over you)
It's never gonna be the way it was, oh (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
It's never gonna be the way it was
And it's so crazy, what you do (Hey, hey, hey, hey, what you do)
What you do to me, oh yeah (What you do)
This isn't how I remember us (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
It's never gonna be the way it was, oh

[Verse 2]
It's a shot to my veins, lying in your bed
Never thought I'd be back with you again
So, do your worst, 'cause you know that I'll always forgive you
Guess I will, guess I will

[Chorus]
I'm going crazy over you (Hey, hey, hey, hey, over you)
Over you again, yeah (Over you)
It's never gonna be the way it was, oh (Ha, ha, ha)

What you do to me, baby (What you do)
This isn't how I remember us (Ha, ha)
No, it's never gonna be the way it was (Ha, ha)

[Verse 1]
I saw you on the corner
You look happy, happier than I do
Your hair's a little longer
Am I crazy, is it blonder than it was than
When you walked out my house?
I didn't say a thing, no
It's funny how a year can fill your head with should've, would've, could've been

[Pre-Chorus]
Took my words, wrote them down, threw them out
And now there's only five left to tell you

[Chorus]
Baby, I want you back
There's a space in my bed
In the shape of your head
I said it, what if I said it?
Baby, I want you back
Would you come back around?
'Cause I need you right now
I said it, there, I said it
Baby, I want you back

[Verse 2]
Would you meet me at the chateau?
At a table, I'd get your favorite chardonnay, yeah
'Cause babe, you know, a bottle is a little bit too much to drink alone
We could catch up, make out, make up
'Cause I don't wanna go (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Another day without you, come on

[Chorus]
Baby, I want you back
There's a space in my bed (In my bed)
In the shape of your head (Of your head)
I said it, what if I said it? (Yeah)
Baby, I want you back (I want you)
Would you come back around? (Around)
'Cause I need you right now
I said it, there, I said it (Yeah)

Baby, I want you back

[Verse 1]
Turn that music way down low
We'll take it nice and slow
I'll play it for you, just like you like it
Oh, we're two shadows in the dark
Nothing between us but a spark
I'll light this night up just like you like it

[Chorus]
Girl, it's all for you, everything I do
You just set the groove
I'll pour it on, strong and smooth
We've got all night long
So, tell me what you want
I'm gonna love you just like you like it

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, just like you like it

[Verse 2]
I'll brush that hair back off your face
Girl, let my fingers trace all over you
Just like you like it
You breathe my name, I feel the heat
Now we're on fire in these sheets
'Cause I'm burning for you, just like you like it

[Chorus]
Girl, it's all for you, everything I do
You just set the groove

I'ma get you there, get you there, get you there

[Chorus]
Girl, it's all for you, everything I do
You just set the groove

Just like you like it, oh, just like you like it
Just like you like it, just like you like it

[Verse 1]
July, it's only been a month since I met you
I gotta say that was my favorite June
And I knew from that night that I would be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
If I, I only knew that one day I would find
Someone like you, I'd take back all those nights I wasted
Looking for the right one at the wrong door

[Chorus]
We fit together, you make me better
Whatever it takes, I'm here forever
Bad things'll happen, but none of that matters
We'll find a way, as long as I'm with you, I'm okay

[Verse 2]
Baby, I'm all in it, just tell me you were all in it
People wanna talk, shut 'em all off
And tell 'em all to mind their business
Will for the grumps and cynics
Been that way from the beginning
People see what they don't have
They get sad and act out 'cause they're winning

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I love the way you wanna love me, too
Ooh, eh, eh

[Chorus]
We fit together, you make me better
Whatever it takes, I'm here forever
Bad things'll happen, but none of that matters
We'll find a way, as long as I'm with you, I'm okay

[Post-Chorus]
Nothing else matters
As long as I'm with you, I'm okay
Nothing else matters
As long as I'm with you, I'm okay
Yeah, nothing else matters

Eh, eh, as long as I'm with you, I'm okay

Ooh, I love the way you wanna love me, too
Ooh
Ooh, I love the way you wanna love me, too
Ooh, eh, eh

We'll find a way, as long as I'm with you, I'm okay

[Post-Chorus]
Nothing else matters
As long as I'm with you, I'm okay
Nothing else matters
As long as I'm with you, I'm okay
Yeah, nothing else matters
And baby, I know, we'll find a way
Eh, eh, as long as I'm with you, I'm okay

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'm having it on me, I know I look saucy, yeah
Told her, "Call up the baby"
Told her, "Come get it off me"
That lil' bitch say I'm boring, yeah
How went I got it on me? Yeah
I might give her a bunny, yeah
I been having a moment, yeah
I might hop in a foreign, I might hop in a foreign
I might fuck on your daughter, suck me up while the car run
Pulling up with my niggas, pulling up and you flipping
Pulling up with the missile, pulling up with the pistol

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
My money is on me, I pull up and cash out
My cars is platinum, my foreign gone back out
My shoes are by Ralph, I'm stacking this cash up
I'm just fucking a bitch, I came for the cash
I'm ballin, on God yeah, I'm thinking bout buying you
Yeah, I'ma cut off your fingers, I'ma cut out your spine too
You should scream for your mama, I done tied up your father
What the fuck is you doing?
Nigga, I'm just pursuing
I'ma cash out then skeet out a lot
I'ma go 'head and fuck on the thot
I'ma go 'head and put all my niggas on
I'ma go 'head and turn 'em up, boy
Got the God father out tonight
He just saw me dirty up the Sprite
He just saw me dirty up my life
He just saw me dirty up the sky

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'm having it on me, I know I look saucy, yeah
Told her, "Call up the baby"
Told her, "Come get it off me"
That lil' bitch say I'm boring
How went I got it on me?
I might give her a bunny
I just had me a moment, yeah
I just hopped in a foreign, I just hopped in a foreign
I just fucked on the car and told that bitch she look boring
I just feel like a nigga, I just pull up with niggas
Pulling up with my niggas, pulling up with my

[Verse 2: Trouble]
It won't take me long, ain't no story
You got your bitch shit in the storage
You sat on the drink plus you boring
That bitch asking me for an orgy
Niggas ain't real and we know it
Thug on my round and my woadie
Slide through the brick with my woadie
Pull on shawty make orders
How in the fuck a nigga just forget about it
Nigga kept it treacherous like the A
Lil' mama stripping but all 'bout her business
Fuck around and got an Audi, got 'em hating
I can't forget about it, can't forget about it
Nigga going about it for a bank
I can't forget about it, nigga catch a life about the money all for the rank
Whole squad on the drank
Tryna die from the pain
You niggas all insane
All that hating that you doin', my nigga, just gon' turn me up, man, I promise
Just made a 

[?]

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'm having it on me, I know I look saucy, yeah
Told her, "Call up the baby"
Told her, "Come get it off me"
That lil' bitch say I'm boring
How went I got it on me?
I might give her a bunny
I just had me a moment, yeah
I just hopped in a foreign, I just hopped in a foreign
I just fucked on the car and told that bitch she look boring
I just feel like a nigga, I just pull up with niggas
Pulling up with my niggas, pulling up with my
All day, hiding from the sun
Waiting for the golden one
Waiting for your fame
After the parade has gone

Outside was a happy place
Every face had a smile like the golden face
For a second
Your knuckles white as your fingers curl
The shot that was heard around the world
For a second

It took seconds of your time to take his life
It took seconds
It took seconds of your time to take his life
It took seconds
It took seconds of your time to take his life
Seconds of your time to take his life
Seconds, seconds
It took seconds of your time to take his life
It took seconds
It took seconds of your time to take his life
It took seconds
For a second
It took seconds of your time to take his life
It took seconds
It took seconds of your time to take his life
It took seconds
For a second
It took seconds of your time to take his life
Seconds of your time to take his life
For a second
For a second
For a second

[Verse 1]
Wake up with somebody near you
And at someone else's place
You took acid and looked in the mirror
Watched the beard crawl around on your face
Oh, the revolution was here
That would set you free from those bourgeoisie
In the morning everything's clearer
When the sunlight exposes your age

[Chorus 1]
But that's okay
That's okay

[Verse 2]
Grab your clothes and head to the doorway
If you dance out, no one complains
Find the place where you can be boring
Where you won't need to explain
That you're sick in the head
And you wish you were dead
Or at least instead of sleeping here
You prefer your own bed, come on
You just suck at self-preservation
Versus someone else's pain

[Chorus 2]
So you feel drained
And insane
And insane

[Verse 3]
He was leather and you were screaming
Swinging chains against the stage
And you couldn't know he was leaving
But now more will go with age, you know
So get up and stop your complaining
You know, you're the only one who's been destroying all the fun
Look what happened when you were dreaming
And just punch yourself in the face
So you kiss and you clutch but you can't fight that feeling
That your one true love is just awaiting your big meeting
So you never even ask for names
You just look right through them as if you already came

[Chorus 3]
It's a drug of the heart and you can't stop the shaking
'Cause the body wants what it's terrible at taking, oh
And you can't remember the meaning
But there's no going back against this California feeling

[Outro]
Dream (Sha-bang, sha-bang)
American dream (Sha-bang, sha-bang)
American dream (Sha-bang, sha-bang)
American dream (Sha-bang, sha-bang)

[Verse 1]
You wanted a hit
But maybe we don't do hits
I try and try, it ends up feeling kind of wrong
You wanted it tough
But is it ever tough enough?
No, nothing's ever tough enough
Until we hit the road
And you wanted it lush
But honestly, you must hush
No, honestly, you know too much
So leave us, leave us on our own

[Refrain]
You wanted a hit
Well, this is how we do hits
You wanted a hit
But that's not what we do, sugar

[Verse 2]
You wanted it real
But can you tell me what's real?
We've got lights and sounds and stories, music's just a part
Then you wanted the truth
And then you said you want proof
I guess you're used to liars saying what they want

[Chorus]
Still, we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies 'til you take us home
And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We can't be your babies 'til you take us home

[Verse 3]
You wanted it smart
But honestly, I'm not smart
No, honestly, I'm never smart
We fake it, fake it all the time
Then you wanted the time
But maybe I can't do time
We both know that's an awful line
But this doesn't make it wrong
You wanted it right
No out of mine and out of sight
No filthy bus and early flight
No seven days and forty nights

[Refrain]
You wanted a hit
Please tell me, where's the point in it?
You wanted a hit
But that's not what we do

[Chorus]
Still, we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies 'til you take us home
And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We can't be your babies 'til you take us home
And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies 'til you take us home
And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies 'til you take us home, sugar
Home, home in the late night
And away, away in the half light
Except Saturdays, crushed by the boring
And played and plagued by the touring again
When once you had believed it
Now you see it's sucking you in

To string you along with the pretense
And pave the way for the coming release

Alone and prone in the half light
And late, late to your real life
If you find a way into the gold rush
You will stay until the morning comes

You can normalize
Don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize
Don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize
Don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize
Don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize
Don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize
Don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize
Don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize
Don't it make you feel alive?
Get innocuous

[Intro]
We all, we all, we all, we all know this is nothing
We all, we all, we all, we all know this is nothing
We all, we all, we all, we all know this is nothing
And this is nowhere
We all, we all, we all, we all know this is nowhere
And there is no one here

[Verse 1]
It moves like a virus and enters our skin
The first sign divides us, the second is moving to Berlin
But that's not the state I'm in
The air is thin but that's not the state

The old guys are frightened and frightening to behold
The kids come out fighting and still doing what they're told
But you're waking a monster
That could drag you from your hoary holes of gold
And your body will get cold

[Chorus]
And we don't waste time with love
It's just death from above

[Verse 2]
Your head is on fire, your hands are getting weak
We all, we all get stupid in the heat (We all, we all)
You've basted your brains on the static and defeat up on the street
This is nowhere
The early years were boring
The quiet, unhappy punk
See mother was a cripple
And your father was a drunk but gentleman
So we do the best we can
This is the plan
Wear your makeup like a man

[Chorus]
'Cause we don't waste time with love
Yeah, we don't waste time with love
It's just a push and a shove

[Verse 3]
Well, it's a full-blown rebellion but you're easy to confuse
By trigger kids and fakers and some questionable views
So call the cops, call the preachers
Before they let us on the loose
When oh, we all (We all, we all)
Start arguing the history of the Jews (We all, we all)
You got nothing left to lose
Gives me the blues

[Chorus]
And we don't waste time with love
No, we don't waste time with love

[Outro]
So call the police
Yeah, call the police
Yeah, call the police
Yeah, call the police
Go call the police
Go call the police
Just text the cops
Yeah, call the law
You're crazy, man
Just call the police
Yeah, call the police
The first in line, they're gonna eat the rich

[Verse 1]
I used to dance alone of my own volition
I used to wait all night for the rock transmission

[Refrain]
So where'd you go?
You led me far away
And let me go
Let me go

[Verse 2]
I used to see your hands in their weird positions
Used to like your hair when you'd watch musicians

[Refrain]
You said we'd know
Yeah, we'd know
But that's all wrong
That's all gone

[Verse 3]
You made me throw up hands at my own traditions
And then you'd have a laugh at my inhibitions
Oh sure, we're talking tough
Yeah, we're talking tough
Yeah, we're talking tough
Put on Suburban Lawns in prone positions

[Refrain]
Here we go
You led me far away
And let me go
I'm never far away
And here we go
Yeah, we know
But that's all wrong
That's all wrong

[Outro]
I'm still trying to wake up
I'm still trying to wake up
I'm still trying to wake up
When's your time to wake up? Ooh

[Verse 1]
Yeah, everybody's singing the same song
It goes, "Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight"
I never realized that these artists thought so much about dying
But truth be told we all have the same end
Could make you cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
But I'm telling you
This is the best news you're getting all week
Oh sure it's ruling the airwaves
Or what remains of the airwaves
And we're frankly thankful for the market psychology you're hipping us to
Yeah, all the hits are saying the same thing
There's only tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
And life is finite
But shit, it feels like forever
It feels like forever
Hey
Hey

[Verse 2]
Oh is everybody feeling the same stuff?
We're all wild
Except for you
And you know who you are
This is a love song
And you're getting older
I promise you this; you're getting older
And there's improvements unless
You're such a winner
That the future's a nightmare
And there's nothing I can do
Nothing anyone can do about this
And oh, oh-oh
I'm offering you this chance to get even
But oh, oh-oh
You know very well the dialects of negation
Sure enemies haunt you with spit and derision
But friends are the ones who can put you in exile
But that's not right

[Verse 3]
And you're too sharp to be used
Or you're too shocked from being used
By these bullying children of the fabulous
Raffling off limited edition shoes
And what's it you do again?
Oh I'm a reminder
The hobbled veteran of the disk shop inquisition
Sent to parry, parry the cocksure of mem-stick filth
With my own late era middle-aged ramblings
Every lover favors the same things
It's all "touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me tonight"
We maybe realize what it is we need before we die
And luck is always better than skill at things
We're flying blind
Oh good gracious
Sorta sound like my mom

[Verse 4]
But out of the little rooms and onto the streets
You've lost your internet and we've lost our memories
We had a paper trail which led to our secrets
Now embarrassing pictures have just all been deleted
By versions of selves that we thought were the best ones
'Til versions of versions of others repeating
Come laughing at everything you thought was important
While still making mistakes that you thought you had learned from
And beautiful people know better than you
That cost in the long run but they can't play the short game
And terrible people know better than you
The use and abuse of the wants of dear listener
Still you will be badgered and taunted and told that
You're missing some party that you'll never get over
You hate the idea that you're wasting your youth
That you stood in the background oh until you got older
But that's all lies
That's all lies
That's all lies
That's all lies

[Intro]
Home
Home
Home
Home
Home
Home
Take me home

[Verse 1]
Just do it right
Make it perfect and real
Because it's everything, everything
That was never the deal
So grab your things and stumble into the night
So we can shut the door on terrible times
No

[Verse 2]
Yeah, do it right
And head again into space
So you can carry on, carry on
And follow all over the place
This is the trick, forget a terrible year
And we can shut the door until it gets weird

[Verse 3]
And this is what you waited for
But under lights, we’re all unsure
So tell me
What would make you feel better?
As night has such a local ring
And love and rock are fickle things

[Refrain]
And you know it
Yeah, you know it
Yeah, you know
Know-oh
Know-oh
Take it

[Verse 3]
Forget your past
This is your last chance now
And we can break the rules
Like fuck all will last
You might forget
Forget the sound of James' voice
Though you should not forget, don't forget
All the shit that we laughed about

[Verse 4]
And after rolling on the floor
And thankfully, a few make sure that you get home
And you stay home
’Cause you better
'Cause you're afraid of what you need
Yeah, you're afraid of what you need

[Refrain]
If you weren't
I don't know what we'd talk about
Know-oh, oh-oh
Know-oh, oh-oh
Know-oh, oh-oh
Know-oh, oh-oh

[Outro]
Yeah, no one ever knows what you're talking about
So I guess you’re already there
And no one opens up when you scream and shout
So it’s time to make a couple things clear
If you're afraid of what you need
If you’re afraid of what you need
Look around you, you're surrounded
It won't get any better
So say goodnight

[Intro]
What am I gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do
Gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna?
What am I gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do
Gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna?
What am I gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do
Gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna?
What am I gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do
Gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna?
What am I gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do
Gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna?
What am I gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do
Gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna?
What am I gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do
Gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna?
What am I gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna?
I can't kick this feeling when it hits

[Verse]
Do you feel like you ever want
To try my love and see how well it fits?
Baby, can't you see what you do to me?
I can't kick this feeling when it hits
All alone in my bed at night
I grab my pillow and squeeze it tight
I think of you and I dream of you
All of the time, what am I gonna do?

[Chorus]
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I need your love
I'll share my dreams and make you see
How really bad your love I need
I want your love, I need your love
Just like the birds need sky above
I'll share my dreams and make you see
How really bad your love I need

[Verse 1]
I caught your eye when I stepped outside with my emotional haircut
It seems that I've been misunderstood
The look of grave concern in your eyes and your surprise at my emotional haircut
It's better to me, it's much better than it used to be
Now I've got eyes going every which way
I got eyes all over the place
And I got tired of the hotel room and the TV
You wish that you'd been told about whatever has led to this emotional haircut
It ain't a disease
It's just hard to do whatever you please
And treat yourself tonight
To a little love life

[Verse 2]
Now we all get ideas and then shut-shut 'em down with this emotional haircut
No I ain't Dionysian, man
Oh no buddy, no need to be concerned with this emotional haircut
It's part of the game, you know, it's just part of the feat
So let's raise a glass to the bodies in here
Oh, raise a glass to the bodies in here
We're gonna toast till the bodies all soak up the bass
Man, you're in love with the bodies in here and your emotional haircut
Oh just get on the street
Fuck the shuffle, put your shit on repeat

[Bridge]
You've got numbers on your phone of the dead that you can't delete
And you got life-affirming moments in your past that you can’t repeat
Yeah you've numbers on your phone of your dead that you cannot delete
And you're losing all your skin in the middle when you just can't sleep
I know you can't calm down

[Refrain]
Out of your windows and onto the streets
Out of your windows
Out of it
Out to

[Outro]
Do you know what it does?
It puts me up on my feet
It puts me on the floor
But can you hear the heartbeat?
Can you hear the heartbeat?
Just listen to the heartbeat
But can you hear the heartbeat?
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen; it's calming down

[Verse 1]
Oh baby
Oh baby
You're having a bad dream
Here in my arms

[Verse 2]
Oh sugar
You came to me
Could all be a bad thing
Doing you harm, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
Oh lover
You run from me
We move like a bad scene
Shot in the dark

[Chorus]
Oh, but please
Please wake me
But my love lies patiently
Please baby, please
And my love life waits for me

[Verse]
Oh love
You came to me
You were having a bad time
There in your home

Oh sugar
Give in to me
You're just having a bad dream
Of ringing alarms

[Chorus 2]
Oh, but please
Please shake me
But my love sits patiently
Please, baby, please
And my love plays wait and see

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I'm on my knees
Yeah, I'm on my knees
I promise I'm clean
But my love life waits

[Bridge]
And you're already gone
Yeah, you're already gone
You're already home
And my love life stumbles on

[Outro]
Oh baby
Lean into me
There's always a side door
Into the dark
Into the dark

[Dr. Dre]
Yo what's up, this is Dr. Dre and before we get into this album, there's a few things I gotta say
Now I just got a tape of the 1994 Source Music Awards and for everybody that wasn't there or didn't hear about it
A lot of niggas from the East Coast was talkin' shit, about where Hip Hop started, who's running Hip Hop, and all this shit
But check this out, if you ain't down with Death Row, Tha Dogg Pound, Thug Life, the muthafuckin' Lench Mob, the West Coast, my niggas down South, or anybody tryna keep Hip Hop alive
Basically, I think my nigga Ice Cube said it the best...

But now I know
Life doesn't always go my way, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
All I need is time
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between

[Verse 2]
I'm not a girl

Learn to face up to this on my own
I've seen so much more than you know now
So don't tell me to shut my eyes

[Chorus]
I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
All I need is time
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between

Not yet a woman
I'm just trying to find the woman in me, yeah

You know the cycle always gotta continue

You know who I'm talkin' about

I'm gon' run up that Gucci, gon' run up that raft, yeah
Dolla bumpin' with the Saint Laurent on me
And they keep on callin' and they know that I don't answer my cell
Big boy flexin', big bands on the 'Gram
But I only spend it all on myself

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
When I pull up, give this bitch live
And you know that I'ma get mine, yeah, yeah
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
Say you got that shit you don't got
Heard you say that shit a hundred times, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Post Malone]
And I know who we are, yeah
And I know that we ballin'
When you wanna get this money
I don't want your bitch, just know it

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
When I pull up, give this bitch my life
And you know that I'ma get mine, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
Say you got that shit you don't got
Heard you say that shit a hundred times, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Post Malone]
And I know who we are, yeah
And I know that we ballin'
When you wanna get this money
I don't want your bitch, just know it

[Outro: Post Malone]
I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know

[Intro: bearface]
And mother, I am sorry, I never pick up, mm-hmm
Because I'm afraid to disappoint ooh, ooh-ah, ooh, no

[Chorus: Jazmine Sullivan]
Hey, and I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to
Hey, and I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to

[Verse 1: bearface]
We were sat outside on the Harvard floor
With our feet in dirt, and our hearts in awe
I be losin' sleep thinkin' 'bout missed calls
And I see the names circling our thoughts
And I think about if we lose it all
And I turn to shit that you'd never want
Like the smoke, the drink, anything at all
And I'll say again, "Sorry I don't call"
There's no money on my mind
But my money or my mind
What's the first to fall?
I never wanted this shit, yeah

[Chorus: Jazmine Sullivan, Ryan Beatty & serpentwithfeet]
Hey, and I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to
Hey, and I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Sometimes, it be so spot on it hurts
Like when Auntie couldn't decide
Between going to work or church
I've been in my feelings on an island in the dirt
I feel like brothers lie just so my feelings don't get hurt
I said, I'll try vacationing, I'll try to run away
I deleted Facebook, I'll trade fame any day
For a quiet Texas place and a barbecue plate
I'll switch my place if that's good for you, is that good for you?
My ghost still haunt ya, my life is I, Tonya
A big-eyed monster, only face to conquer
I hated songs about fame 'cause that stuff meant nothin'
Until them headlines came, then first flight I'm stuck in

[Bridge: Joba & Jazmine Sullivan]
And maybe it means nothing
But I have to say I think about you often
And if you want no part with me
I'll walk away, I know that I have wronged you
And maybe it means nothing
But I have to say I think about you often
And if you want no part with me
I'll walk away, I know that I have wronged you

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I took a plane to somewhere that I've never been
Too many times without my sister and my brother
Dad or mother by my side but they're in spirit
I always hear it, I know they feel it
My mom will always have these dreams
That used to keep her up at night
I smoke to keep them all away and make use of the time
I'm void of feelin'
The reasons I'm so out of touch now start revealin'
But I'm not ashamed, I'm not afraid of who I am
Or how I trust my mental, yeah, it's not perfect
But I guess that's just the shit I'm into
I fantasize about a time when everything was simple
My shelter sheltered me from things I needed to commit to
The way it stands to me
A victim of Stockholm in my friendships and family

[Verse 4: Merlyn Wood]
What's costin' your time? What's the reason that you whine?
What's in your wallet? Dead whites in mine
So sour, in this light of lime
Daddy said "Study or get that cash"
Mommy said "Your career ain't gon' last"
Loose change, call a cab, move out their pad
I just need a chance to move past my past
Don't think too fast, private jets still crash
And I'll still fly coach, and I'll still hit a roach
And I'll still see roaches at the crib where my folks at
Touch your dreams 'fore you touch me and provoke a man
(Somebody's gonna have to tell the truth and I'm gonna tell it!)

[Outro: Jazmine Sullivan, Ryan Beatty & serpentwithfeet & Matt Champion]
I will
I will
(I don't matter)
I will
(Ahh)
Can I tell you now?
Can I tell you now?
I will

You already know, bandkids the fucking movement
Huh, huh
Sauve
Boom!

[Verse 1: Sauve]
Niggas chose 15 seconds of fame
Over the 15 seconds of reign
VVS diamonds, they shine in the rain
Rollin up gas, don’t remember the strain
Run up a bag, I remember the pain
Take it back, every day I used to train
I was dead broke, used to rock a fake chain
Now every day, we hop on a plane
Did a few shows, and I ran up like 80
Save that shit up, it's supposed to get rainy
Just got a property somewhere in Haiti
Momma said chopper, this gun for her safety
Bitch so bad, might give her a baby
She so happy, I hit on the daily

Yeah, and I'm drippin' like water
Ooh, yeah, bounce back and I'll fuck on your thot, mmh (Fuck on your thot)
Yeah, twenty shows, I don't know where I'm at
Yeah, fifty bands I’ma add to my sack

[Verse 3: Sauve & Soulja Boy & Lil Mosey]
Y-yeah, Trix are for kids
I throw the money, just for the bands
Bellows, just strip a big booty babe
I hit that bitch in the back of my crib
Sometimes in my life, I feel like I’m famous
Lil nigga talking, he know that I made it
Shoot, choppa, it's rainin’
These niggas talking, they know that I made it
Yeah, young nigga eat your motherfuckin' plate
Hop in the gatti and now I'm in the race

Calling my lawyer, I’m getting a case

Whippin' up bands, whippin' up

[?]
Smoking on dope

[?] off a bean

[?] green bean

[Verse 4: Sauve & Soulja Boy]
Bandkids, we blow like a bomb, got the world in our palm
I got some money, gave it to my mom
And she bought us a lawn
Hit the lil bitch then I pass the baton
I take a flight to Milan
Bad bitch, she one of a kind, take that lil' ass and put her on
Niggas gonna hate when they banging my song
I'm at the top like king kong
Back in high school, y'all didn't get along
Everything I do is wrong
Bitch gotta drop her lil thong
Cut the dummies on me 

[?] prom
You know what we smokin, we smokin this strong, as if I didn't belong
No, you don't want smoke
Big Draco at your front door, we pose
Make a wrong move, shoot off your nose
Shot out the Benz, my young nigga kick in your door
I need some lean, pour up a four
Fucking your bitch, fucking your hoe
Yuh, the diamond chain rainbow
I put the rap game in the three-four

[Verse 1]
The world today is such a wicked place
Fighting going on between the human race
People got to work just to earn their bread
While people just across the sea are counting their dead

[Verse 2]
A politician’s job they say is very high
For he has to choose who’s gotta go and die
They can put a man on the Moon quite easy
While people here on Earth are dying of all diseases

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
A woman goes to work every day after day
She just goes to work just to earn her pay
Child sitting crying by a life that’s harder
He doesn’t even know who is his father

[Intro]
Zaytoven
Yeah
Don't tell me what to do, what to do, what to do
All I do is look up, straight up
Cook up
Yeah
Yeah, oh, take it

[Chorus]
What they never handed me
I'm just a young livin' out the fantasies
When life get outta hand, man, they can't handle me

[Verse]
I'm talkin' pure addition, that's my pure addiction
Somethin' out of nothin', we was not magicians
5AM up in the kitchen, doing everything except the dishes
Speakin', spammin', splottin', schemin', scammin'
While you took advice, I took advantage, cook up
Back when momma had bills, back when life was heavy as an anvil
The first time I touched a hunnid dollar bill, I had chills
Back when stepbro used to move the pills, I thought it was an Advil
He said, "You can't snitch"
Back when Alisca cheated on me, first time I turned my job into a main bitch
So cold, young with an old soul
Back when granny used to irk the 

[?] bill
Thinkin' "oh, no", I need that 

[?] the low-low, ridin' low-pro
Thankin' God I hit the eject
Back when momma had the c-sec, I knew I was as special as a t-Rex
Even when they tried to treat me like a reject, take it back
Respect

[Chorus]
What they never handed me
I'm just a young livin' out the fantasies
When life get outta hand, man, they can't handle me, take it
What they never handed me
I'm just a young livin' out the fantasies
When life get outta hand, man, they can't handle me

One, two, three

Six, six, six

Open your eyes

The Lord is all around you, child
And that's what you’re made of
Remember, there is a light
And it shines bright just for you
And you can't cut yourself off from it
No matter what you do

[Verse]
I had a 3.5 at Duke and I was blowin' up
Three albums, I got a row of ducks
When my dad was 22, dawg, he drove a truck
January in Detroit is cold as fuck
You know it’s tough, but I came this far, I ain't slowin up
Livin' life with the LeBron James shoulder-shrug
One thing you'll never hear me say is "Close enough"
I'm dope as fuck
I lost 2018 to a broken heart
I wrote this whole thing, I know my part
I made a wild fire from a glowing spark
I press go in March, I gotta go and march
All previous conceptions are blown apart
Not everyone can come with me, it's Noah's Ark
I ain't Gregg Popovich, I have no remark
These are the type of riches one can only hold in heart (Woo)
And anyone that’s gone over my history
Knows I ain’t stuck in the mold of the industry
I am walking down a road of epiphanies
Three words: growth over consistency
Woo, back again, they've been tapping out, McGregor
I’ve been tapping in
Livin' out the dreams I was once just imaginin', it's happenin’
I get so much work done nowadays, it's almost like I have a twin
I can't just sit on the couch shoveling shit in my mouth
I don't know how I'ma walk across this country
But I know I'm a figure it out
And who knows what I'm gon' do when it's done
Hopefully, I touch a life; you could be one
I'm not walking to show people who l am
I'm walking to find out who I'll become
And people ain't stupid, they know what's real
Sometime to get to Heaven, we gotta go through hell
And I'm rollin' deep, no Adele
You could ask World Wide Wes, dawg, he knows me well
My life's like an instruction manual
How to not be borin' (Not be borin')
It's my spirit, my smile
That have got me soarin' (Got me soarin')
It broke my heart to tell the band
We will not be tourin' (Not be tourin')
But I just gotta do this (I gotta do it)
I can't stop explorin' (No no)
I was a short lil' Jewish kid, I ain't speak much
My whole life now is somethin' that I've dreamed up
With no handout, I look at my heroes and that's what I am now
Yoga class headband now
People say I'm off-brand, how?
I am the brand
Therefore, anything I do is on-brand now
I'm on-brand now
People got attached to a version of me
And it hurts when they see a person who's free
But I'm so grateful for all of these lessons
Twice as much money, half the possessions
No drugs, now the vision's clear
People mad 'cause the old me isn't here
All my gold jewelry just disappeared
That's the universe tellin' me to start switchin' gears
Deeper the human, the deeper the songs
Look at my life, the dream isn't gone
I saw all of this two years ago
It's almost like it was me reading my poem
People copy, but they copy wrong
Puttin' out a bunch of sloppy songs
If I die in the Rockies, don't
Forget to bury me with the Petoskey stone
And opportunities keep on poppin' up
Killer concepts come to me in shavasana
This is just an intro, a daydream
The rest comes January 18th

[Chorus]
Open your eyes
Make room for a little sweet love
The Lord is all around you, child
And that's what you're made of
Remember, there is a light
And it shines bright just for you
You can't cut yourself off from it
No matter what you do, no

[Outro]
Open your eyes

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Yeah, yeah, oh-oh-ah-ah
Yeah, yeah, uh, oh-ah-ah
Yeah, ayy

[Chorus]
Let's take a look here lil' mama, she got that ass on her
Oh, take a look here, lil' mama, I got some cash drawn in
Oh, take a look here, lil' mama, I'll be the mailman
I got some bands, man, I do my thang, man
You got that ah-a-ooh-ah
Baby, I pull up on you, you got this two, nah
Baby, when I stack money up top for two, ah
Pull up on ya, let God get ya opp, get ya uwop

[Verse 1]
When I get on the easy cash-out and just leave
My 30 in my Beamer, Balance down in my jeans
Authentic for my Beamer, 3D all on my jeans
Two California G's with 30 all in my beads

[Chorus]
Let's take a look here lil' mama, she got that ass on her
Oh, take a look here, lil' mama, I got some cash drawn in
Oh, take a look here, lil' mama, I'll be the mailman
I got some bands, man, I do my thang, man
You got that ah-a-ooh-ah
Baby, I pull up on you, you got this two, nah
Baby, when I stack money up top for two, ah
Pull up on ya, let God get ya opp, get ya uwop

[Verse 2]
When I get on the -- Vibe to the drop, vicing on the lick
See my box and my watch? Icing on my wrist
You done watched, you done plot
Not fightin' it like this, I like it like this, my type just like this
Hey, I can get Chanel for you, you got some bitches, baby?
Get you, get you time for you
Oh, when I'm pulling on that 40, in the sky with ya
Oh, when it's dippin', get ya ditching, gonna die with ya
Uh, uh, you got that
Ice rocks, ticks, tocks, picks, cocks for real
Big lock, big drop, hunnid drop for real
Anytime city pop, when I pop the deal
Little mama, she a thot, wanna pop a pill

[Chorus]
Look here lil' mama, she got that ass on her
Oh, take a look here, lil' mama, I got some cash drawn in
Oh, take a look here, lil' mama, I'll be the mailman
I got some bands, man, I do my thang, man
You got that ah-a-ooh-ah
Baby, I pull up on you, you got this two, nah
Baby, when I stack money up top for two, ah
Pull up on ya, let God get ya opp, get ya uwop
Skit
The first time it happened, I was in my 20s, uhm
I discovered I would, I would float off, out of my body
By a matter of 2 or 3 feet and I would float above my body

Intro
I took a walk into the unknown
Closed my eyes and let the most high guide my soul
My reflection in the moon light
It took a while to see it was me
It was me
O. B. E
I know you
Ohh

Verse 1 (Anderson .Paak)
Sitting in my bedroom counting
Money by the thousands
Not enough to say but its just enough to get me up the grey
So I'm heading on a one way train to the Bey, up the mountain
The true definition of a come up
Better yet the definition of the perfect summer
Hotter than July as I ride through the tunnel
Thinking how can I survive in this WiFi jungle
Was the time that I heard God mumble
Open up your eyes enterprise space shuttle
Put that bitch in drive let it ride through the ruckus
Get high motherfucker, these haters can't touch you
Higher than the OBEY flyer
Still whipping something from my knuckles like a slider
Shadow is to the hand and the hand is to the body as to the soul and the true definition of rock n roll
Outro
There were shooters in all directions
On piece with the land
On the side was the weapon
I'm a wanted man
I'm blind, in and out of my calling
I've gots to give my all in it
But Oh no, no, the God won't fall victim

Hey!
We in this motherfucker (Right!)
We in this motherfucker (True)
We in this motherfucker (Right!)
We in this bitch (Hey!)

We in this motherfucker (Right!)
We in this motherfucker (True)
We in this motherfucker (Right!)

Outro Skit
A man is but the product of his thoughts
What he thinks he becomes
A man is completely innocent
Offered himself as sacrifice for the good of others including his enemies and became the ransom of the world
It was a perfect act
A policy is a temporary creed liable to be changed
But while it holds good, it has got to be perceived with, Apostolic ...

[Chorus]
I wanna go back to it
I wanna backtrack to it
And if there's a path to it
I'd have to forget what you did

[Verse 1]
Tell me that you're sorry
And I promise to try to forgive
Tell me you still want me
And maybe I could be a little less sensitive

[Chorus]
I wanna go back to it
I wanna backtrack to it
And if there's a path to it
I'd have to forget what you did

[Verse 2]
If you could acknowledge
That you left me here guarding the door
And hold me like you used to
Then maybe I could feel less insecure

[Chorus]
I wanna go back to it
I wanna backtrack to it
And if there's a path to it
I'd have to forget what you did

[Verse 3]
Did you even bother
To understand how I might feel?
How do I make sense of
What feels like we're pretending
And what feels real?

[Chorus]
And I wanna go back to it
I wanna backtrack to it
And if there's a path to it
I'd have to forget what you did

[Verse 1]
Change my life, everyone is telling me
To change my life
Oh, maybe I'm depressed, or maybe I know too much
About the world, about myself

[Pre-Chorus]
I know some good luck and a good fuck
A nice glass of wine and some quality time
Is gonna make you mine
(But it's not what I'm trying to find)
I know some good luck and a good fuck
A nice glass of wine and some quality time
Is gonna make you mine
(And it's fine, and it's fine, and it's fine)

[Chorus]
Is my chemistry
Not forgiving me?
Body chemistry
Unrelenting
Unforgiving
Unforgiving

[Verse 2]
Oh, everyone is in one room
And I'm in the next room
I lean into the corner
I smell the wall, I exhale, I smell it again

[Pre-Chorus]
I know some good luck and a good fuck
A nice glass of wine and some quality time
Is gonna make you mine
(But it's not what I'm trying to find)
I know some good luck and a good fuck
A nice glass of wine and some quality time
Is gonna make you mine
(And it's fine, and it's fine, and it's fine)

[Chorus]
Is my chemistry
Not forgiving me?
Body chemistry
Unrelenting
Unforgiving

[Pre-Chorus]
I know some good luck and a good fuck

Is my chemistry
Not forgiving me?
Body chemistry
Unrelenting
Is my chemistry
Not forgiving me?

[Verse 1]
My pretty cloud in the sky
I'm watching you from afar
Sometimes you float up and grace me with sun
And sometimes you come very close
And multiply yourself
Heavy and thick, raining sorrow on me

[Chorus]
Still, I am blissful in whatever you give me
I lean on the mystery of who you are
Still, I am blissful in whatever you show me
A real curiosity of who you are

[Verse 2]
(Hi) Sensitive to temperature, sensitive to moisture
Sensitive to the winds that always come (Goodbye)
(Hi) And there are days where you spread yourself
So thin across the atmosphere that I can't see you (Goodbye)
Anymore

[Chorus]
Still, I am blissful in whatever you give me
I lean on the mystery of who you are
Still, I am blissful in whatever you show me
A real curiosity of who you are

[Bridge: Antoine]
Hey, I'm so sorry you feel sad
I wanted to tell you that I love your sensitivity
And I was so glad you called me this morning (Goodbye)
And for the messages that you sent me yesterday
That I woke up with
I saw when you were calling that your face would change
I'm so sorry, I love you, even if I go to Paris (Goodbye)
You'll just have to come with me

[Chorus]
Still, I am blissful in whatever you give me
I lean on the mystery of who you are
Still, I am blissful in whatever you show me
A real curiosity of who you are

[Outro]
Check, check (Hi)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Goodbye)
Check, check (Hi)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Goodbye)
Goodbye

626 Bedford Avenue
I think I regret that night of kissin' you
(That night of kissin' you)
(That night of kissin' you)

[Verse 1]
Baby, let's have a conversation
And God forbid we have a connection
I'd like to know what you're thinkin'
'Cause I don’t get near what I've been givin'

[Chorus]
626 Bedford Avenue
I think I regret that night of kissin' you
I should have left when you laughed at my shoes
(But I keep on coming back)
626 Stupid Avenue
Don't make me regret that night of kissin' you
I fell in love, and you treat me like shit
(But I keep on coming back)

[Verse 2]
I don't think you're ready
But I don't think you can forget me
Your insecurities are ruining
Everything that we could be
Get your head out of your ass
And take a good look at yourself

[Chorus]
626 Bedford Avenue
I think I regret that night of kissin' you
I should have left when you laughed at my shoes

I fell in love, and you treat me like shit

But I keep on coming back
But I keep on coming back
You might be a psychopath
You might wanna check that

[Verse 1]
Hey, you with that perfect face
I'm not sure if it’s a game I should play
Do you have somethin' good to say?
('Cause I’ve got 300 elephants shitting on my grave)
What's fun when there's nothing to do?
You said you could cum and I said I could too
I wish there was more between me and you
(I want love, I want love, I want love)

[Chorus]
And I don't want to be alone
And I am scared of all the people in the world
And I have never had a home
I am too afraid so I keep moving through the world
I keep moving through the world

[Verse 2]
Change me, time will change me
Well, trust me, baby, the shit comes back
Self-sabotage or is my life on pause?
Am I inventing flaws? The shit comes back

[Chorus]
And I don't want to be alone
And I am scared of all the people in the world
And I have never had a home
I am too afraid so I keep moving through the world
I keep moving through the world

[Bridge]
I would like to find a place
(S- E- N- E- C- A)
Where maybe I could find some peace
(S- E- N- E- C- A)
Even if I change my name
(S- E- N- E- C- A)
Different player, same old game
(S- E- N- E- C- A)

[Chorus]
And I don't want to be alone
And I am scared of all the people in the world
And I have never had a home
I am too afraid so I keep moving through the world
I keep moving through the world

[Verse 1]
I'm not embarrassed to admit that
I need your physicality
Every human becomes weak

[Chorus]
Touch me where I'm hurtin'
Hold me when I don't belong
Kiss away my confusion
Kiss it away, kiss it away, kiss it away, kiss it away

[Verse 2]
You have my permission to do
All that you want to do
Come destroy my fragility

[Chorus]
Touch me where I'm hurtin'
Hold me when I don't belong
Kiss away my confusion
Kiss it away, kiss it away, kiss it away, kiss it away

[Bridge]
(Kiss it away)
(Kiss it away)
This dull sadness, so goddamn stubborn (Kiss it away)
I can't take it anymore
Your body, so shocking
Lay me down on the floor
On the floor

[Chorus]
Touch me where I'm hurtin'
Hold me when I don't belong
Kiss away my confusion
Kiss it away, kiss it away, kiss it away, kiss it away
Kiss it away
Kiss it away

[Verse 1]
Two nights ago we said goodbye
In a borrowed car in the Hollywood hills
I held you, but I should have held you tighter and longer
Two years of laughter and one year of pain
Come crashing to a halt to its final resting place

[Verse 2]
You came over today to a house full of all of our things
And you were holding your coat
You didn't know where to put it down
And you couldn't look me in the eyes
They were darting all around

[Chorus]
And being nervous around you
Oh well, that's something new
That's something new
Being nervous around you
Oh, that's something new
That's something new
Being nervous around you
Oh, that's something new

[Bridge]
Then you put down your coat and you start to walk towards me
And I don't know what it means
But this time I'm gonna hold you a little tighter
And a little longer

[Chorus]
And being nervous around you
Oh, that's something new
That's something new
Being nervous around you
Oh, that's something new
That's something new
Being nervous around you
Oh, that's something new

[Intro]
Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ah
Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ah
Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ah
Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ah

[Verse 1]
Oh, let me sink into this blip of joy
I can't believe this is happening to me

[Pre-Chorus]
It took so long to reach this mountaintop
With just one kiss I forget I hate myself

[Chorus]
Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ah
It's just a little blip of joy
Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ah
Can I feel it again?
Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ah
It's just a little blip of joy
Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ah

[Verse 2]
Surviving off this moment so close to you
The grass is wet and for once my heart is free

[Pre-Chorus]
It took so long to reach this mountaintop
With just one kiss I forget I hate myself

[Chorus]
Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ah
It's just a little blip of joy
Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ah
Can I feel it again?
Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ah
It's just a little blip of joy
Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ah

[Bridge]
I'm scared to ask what your middle name is
'Cause that might be going too far
Gotta let this remain mysterious
'Cause you're a wild dove
And I know you'll fly far
And I'll never see you again
But tonight my heart is singing, it's singing
Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ah
Oh, it's singing
Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ah
But tonight my heart is singing, it's singing
Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ah

[Chorus]
It's just a little blip of joy
Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ah
Can I feel it again?
Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ah
It's just a little blip of joy
Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ah
Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ah
Oh, it's just a little blip of joy
Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ah
Can I feel it again?
Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ah
Oh, it's just a little blip of joy
Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ah
Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ah

[Verse]
Baby, by now you must know that this love is brutal
Beyond physical, supernatural, and fully irrational
I'm no stranger to taking risks, I’ve bet my life on one kiss
I know this is dangerous, we're delirious, but oh, this is glorious

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm alone at night and the TV is on
I grab your T-shirt and put it over my face
I put my hand on my chest so it feels like you’re here
And I'd fly 10,000 miles just to kiss you again

[Chorus]
Brutalism
Brutalism
Our love is heavy and hard
Desire might be the thing that tears us apart

[Bridge]
And when my heart is tired and I can't take any more
I just remember your eyes in the corridor
Your eyes in the corridor

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm alone at night and the TV is on
I grab your T-shirt and put it over my face
I put my hand on my chest so it feels like you're here
And I'd fly 10,000 miles just to kiss you again

[Chorus]
Brutalism
Brutalism
Our love is heavy and hard
Desire might be the thing that tears us apart

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm alone at night and the TV is on
I grab your T-shirt and put it over my face
I put my hand on my chest so it feels like you're here
And I’d fly 10,000 miles just to kiss you again

[Chorus]
Brutalism
Brutalism
Our love is heavy and hard
Desire might be the thing that tears us apart

[Verse 1]
She belongs there left with her liberty
Never known as a non-believer
She laughs and stays in the one-one-one-wonderful

[Verse 2]
She knew how to gather the forest when
God reached softly and moved her body
One golden locket
Quite young and loving her mother and father

[Verse 3]
Farther down the path was a mystery
Through the recess, the chalk and numbers
A boy bumped into her one-one-one-wonderful

[Verse 4]
All fall down and lost in the mystery
Lost it all to a non-believer
And all that's left is a girl
Who's loved by her mother and father

[Verse 5]
She'll return in love with her liberty
Chased away from the non believer
She'll sigh and thank God for one- one- one- wonderful

[Verse 1]
I came in from the outside, burned out from a joy ride
She likes to roll here in my ashes anyway
Played from the bedside is "Stella by Starlight"
That was my heart, the drums that start off "Night and Day"

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The same kind of music haunts her bedroom
I'm almost me again, she's almost you

[Chorus]
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

[Verse 2]
Tell me who, and I'll be thanking them
The numbered lovers of Duke Ellington
Do I owe each kiss to lip and cheek as soft as Chet can sing
Let's get lost and let the good times roll
Let smoke rings from this paper doll
Blow sweet and thick 'til every thought of it don't mean a thing

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I got some colour back, she thinks so, too
I laugh like me again, she laughs like you

[Chorus]
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

[Bridge]
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't, mmm
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know

[Verse 3]
The very thought of you and am I blue?
A love supreme seems far removed
I get along without you very well some other nights
Oh, the radio news reader chimes
Reporting Russian lullabies
She'll turn to me awake and ask, "Is everything alright?"
And, Lord

[Chorus]
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

[Verse]
You're making my skin wanna crawl into all of these cracks and these crevices
Don't worry I know how to have a good time
Just don't need to smile to be enjoying myself
Don't put me on a shelf
I'm not here for your enjoyment, your amusement
I don't need to have a reason, no
Don't need to have a reason at all
Don't need to have a prince at my ball
How about right now I'm my own prince
Maybe I wouldn't cease to exist
Without a man to do the hard things
Maybe you picked the wrong girl
But there's not one girl
Who deserves your aggression
I'll give you a confession
I used to fall for this bullshit
But let's stop regressing
How about I take your patriarchy, your misogyny
And I put it in the backyard
And set fire to it
I'm gonna put it in the backyard
It's already lit

[Refrain]
I'm gonna put it in the backyard
And set fire to it
I'm gonna put it in the backyard
It's already lit

[Chorus]
I'm gonna put it in the backyard
And set fire to it
I'm gonna put it in the backyard
It's already lit
Woo

[Outro]
It's already lit

[Verse 1]
There is a roadway, muddy and foxgloved
Whenever I'd have life enough, my heart is screamin' of
And in a few days I would be there, love
Whatever here that's left of me is yours just as it was

[Chorus]
Just as it was, baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The drug, the dark, the light, the flame

[Verse 2]
The highs hit the heights of my baby
And its hold had the fight of my baby
And the lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved

[Bridge]
Tell me if somehow, some of it remains
How long you would wait for me?
And how long I've been away
The shape that I'm in now, your shape in the doorway
Make your good love known to me
Or just tell me 'bout your day

[Chorus]
Just as it was, baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The drug, the dark, the light, the shame

[Outro]
The highs hit the heights of my baby
And its hold had the fight of my baby
And the lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved
And the sights were as stark as my baby
And the cold cut as sharp as my baby
And the nights were as dark as my baby
And half as beautiful too

[Verse 1]
I'd be the voice that urged Orpheus
When her body was found (Hey, yeah)
I'd be the choiceless hope in grief
That drove him underground (Hey, yeah)
I'd be the dreadful need in the devotee
That made him turn around (Hey, yeah)
And I'd be the immediate forgiveness
In Eurydice
Imagine being loved by me

[Chorus]
I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things I would do
So I try to talk refined for fear that you find out  (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imaginin' you

[Verse 2]
I'd be the last shred of truth
In the lost myth of true love (Hey, yeah)
I'd be the sweet feeling of release
Mankind now dreams of (Hey, yeah)
That's found in the last witness
Before the wave hits, marvelling at God (Hey, yeah)
Before he feels alone one final time and marries the sea
Imagine being loved by me

[Chorus]
I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things I would do
So I try to talk refined for fear that you find out  (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imaginin' you
I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things we could do
So I try to talk refined for fear that you find out  (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imaginin' you

[Verse 1]
When all the worst we fear lets fall its weight
When the gyre widens on and when the wave breaks
When St. Peter loses cool and bars the gates
When Atlas acts the maggot, makes his arms shake
When the birds are heard again in their singin'
Once atrocity is hoarse from voicin’ shame
And when the earth is trembling on some new beginnin'
With the same sweet shock of when Adam first came

[Pre-Chorus]
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you’ve always been
(Lover, be good to me)

[Chorus 1]
Be as you've always been (Lover, be good to me)
Be like the love that discovered the sin (Lover, be good to me)
That freed the first man and will do so again
And, lover, be good to me (Lover, be good to me)
Be that hopeful feeling when Eden was lost (Lover, be good to me)
It's been deaf to our laughter since the master was crossed (Lover, be good to me)
Which side of the wall really suffers that cost?
Oh, lover, be good to me

[Verse 2]
When the man who gives the order
Is born next time 'round on the boat sent back
When the bodies starvin' at the border
Are on TV givin' people the sack
Oh, when the sea rises to meet us
Oh, when there's nothin' left for you and I to do
Oh, when there’s nobody upstairs to receive us
When I have no kind words left, love for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you’ve always been
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
(Lover, be good to me)

[Chorus 2]
Ah, be love in its disrepute (Lover, be good to me)
Scorches the hillside and salts every root (Lover, be good to me)
And watches the slowin’ and starvin' of troops
And, lover, be good to me (Lover, be good to me)
Be there and just as you stand (Lover, be good to me)
Or be like the rose that you hold in your hand (Lover, be good to me)
That will grow bold in a barren and desolate land
Oh, lover, be good to me

[Outro]
Love, won't you be
Love, won't you be
Be as you’ve always been?
Love, won't you be
Love, won't you be
Be as you've always been?
Love, won't you be
Love, won't you be
Be as you've always been?
Love, won't you be
Love, won't you be
Be as you've always been?

[Verse 1]
Honey, this club here is stuck up
Dinner and diatribes
I knew well from our first hookup
The look of mischief in your eyes
Your friends are a fate that befell me
Hell is the talking type
I'd suffer Hell if you’d tell me
What you'd do to me tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me
Tell me
Tell me, ah

[Chorus]
That's the kind of love
I’ve been dreaming of
That's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of

[Verse 2]
Honey, I laugh when it sinks in
A pillar I am, upright
Scarcely can speak for my thinking
What you'd do to me tonight
Now that the evening is slowing
Now that the end's in sight
Honey, it's easier knowing what you'd do to me tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me
Tell me
Tell your man

[Chorus]
That's the kind of love
I’ve been dreaming of
That’s the kind of love
I've been dreaming of

[Bridge]
(That’s the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love)
Oh, let there be hotel complaints and grievances raised
And that kind of love
(That’s the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love)
Oh, let there be damage ensued and tabloid news
And that kind of love
(That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love)
That's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of
Ah, oh-oh-oh, ah

[Chorus]
That's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of
And that's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of

[Verse 1]
True that I saw her hair like the branch of a tree
A willow dancing on air before covering me
Under cotton and calicoes
Over canopy dappled long ago
True that love in withdrawal was the weepin' of me
That the sound of the saw must be known by the tree
Must be felled for to fight the cold
Fretted fire but that was long ago

[Chorus]
It's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh)
And I blink in sight (Oh, oh)
Of your blinding light (Oh, oh)
Oh, it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where you hold me tight (Oh, oh)
And the fire bright (Oh, oh)
Oh, let it blaze alright (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, but that you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
With the roar of the fire, my heart rose to its feet
Like the ashes of ash, I saw rise in the heat
Settled soft and as pure as snow
I fell in love with the fire long ago
With each love I cut loose, I was never the same
Watching still-living roots be consumed by the flame
I was fixed on your hand of gold
Layin' waste to my lovin' long ago

[Chorus]
But that's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh)
And I blink in sight (Oh, oh)
Of your blinding light (Oh, oh)
And it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where you hold me tight (Oh, oh)
And the fire bright (Oh, oh)
Oh, let it blaze alright, honey (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)

[Verse 3]
So in awe, there I stood as you licked off the grain
Though I've handled the wood, I still worship the flame
As long as amber of ember glows
All the "would" that I'd loved is long ago

[Chorus]
And it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh)
And I blink in sight (Oh, oh)
Of your blinding light (Oh, oh)
Oh, it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where you hold me tight (Oh, oh)
And the fire bright (Oh, oh)
Oh, let it blaze alright (Oh, oh)
Oh,  you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, you're good to me, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)

[Verse 1]
I would shun the light, share in evening's cool and quiet
Who would trade that hum of night
For sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
But whose heart would not take flight?
Betray the moon as acolyte
On first and fierce affirming sight
Of sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

[Chorus]
I had been lost to you, sunlight
And flew like a moth to you, sunlight, oh, sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight, oh
But it is sunlight

[Verse 2]
All the tales the same
Told before and told again
A soul that’s born in cold and rain
Knows sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
And at last can grant a name
To a buried and a burning flame
As love and its decisive pain
Oh, my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

[Chorus]
All that was shown to me, sunlight
Was somethin' foreknown to me, sunlight, oh sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight, sunlight

[Bridge]
Oh, all these colors fade for you only
Hold me, carry me slowly, my sunlight
Oh, all these colors fade for you only
Hold me, carry me slowly, my sunlight

[Verse 3]
Each day, you'd rise with me
Know that I would gladly be
The Icarus to your certainty
Oh, my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
Strap the wing to me
Death trap clad happily
With wax melted, I’d meet the sea
Under sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

[Chorus]
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight

[Outro]
Sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

[Verse 1]
You know when it's twelve o'clock in Soho, baby
It's gin o'clock where I wake up, I don't know
And I think about you though, everywhere I go
And I've done everythin' and I've been everywhere, you know

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been fed gold by sweet fools in Abu Dhabi
And I've danced real slow with Rockettes on dodgy molly

[Chorus]
But I've had no love like your love, ooh, from nobody
I'd be appalled if I saw you ever try to be a saint
I wouldn't fall for someone I thought couldn't misbehave
But I want you to know that I've had no love like your love

[Verse 2]
Honey, when you warm the bed on Wednesday
It's suicide Tuesday back in LA
If I had the choice between hearing either noise
The excitement of a thousand, or the soothing of your voice

[Pre-Chorus]
At first chance, I'd take the bed warmed by the body, woo
I once warmed my hands over a burnin' Maserati, woo

[Chorus]
Still I've had no love like your love from nobody
I'd be appalled if I saw you ever try to be a saint
I wouldn't fall for someone I thought couldn't misbehave
But I want you to know that I've had no love like your love

[Outro]
And on the other side, why should we deny the truth?
We could have less to worry about, honey, I won't lie to you
But everything I do, I've had no love like your love

[Verse 1]
Remember when you'd sing just for the fuck of it?
Any joy it would bring, honey, the look of it
Was as sweet as the sound
Your head tilt back, your funny mouth to the clouds
I couldn't hope to know that song or know its words
Wouldn't claim to feel the same we felt the first time it was heard
And I couldn't name that feeling carried in that voice
Was it that or just the act of makin' noise that brought you joy?

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't have to sing it right
But who could call you wrong?
To put your emptiness to melody
Your awful heart to song
You don't have to sing it nice, but honey sing it strong
At best, you'll find a little remedy
At worst, the world will sing along

[Chorus]
So honey, sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing

[Verse 2]
Remember when you'd sing before we'd move to it?
And we'd scuff up our shoes, honey, the groove of it
Was whatever you choose
"I Wanna Be Your Lover" or "The Fisherman's Blues"

[Pre-Chorus]
You didn't always sing it right
But who could call you wrong?
To put your emptiness to melody
Your awful heart to song
You don't have to sing it nice, but honey sing it strong
At best, you'll find a little remedy
At worst, the world will sing along

[Chorus]
So honey, sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing

[Bridge]
Who could ask you
Be unbroken or be brave again?
Or, honey, hope even on this side of the grave again
And who could ask you to be sound or to feel saved again?
But stick around until you hear that music play again

[Chorus]
So honey, sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing

[Outro]
Remember when you'd sing just for the love of it?
And any joy it would bring

[Intro]
Ooh
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Ooh
Do-do-do-do-do

[Verse 1]
Sand keeps slipping right through my hands
Days all feel the same, still numb from you
First step off of this plane, I knew
I suffocate without you, heart beats for two

[Pre-Chorus]
It was good (Was good)
What we had (What we had)
If it was paradise
Can somebody take me back? (Take me back)
And it hurts (It hurts)
Looking back (Looking back)
If this is for the best
Then tell me why it hurts so bad (So bad)

[Chorus]
Don't let go when the daylight's gone
'Cause it's always darkest before the dawn
I breathe, oh
When the cold air starts filling up my lungs
When I hate the things that I've become
I breathe, oh

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Ooh, ooh
Do-do-do-do-do

[Verse 2]
Regrets dancing around my head, everything I never said
Still numb from you (From you, from you, from you)
Secrets sleeping all over this bed (Over this bed)
Memories of what we did (What we did)
Got mixed with you (Oh whoa)

[Pre-Chorus]
And it hurts (It hurts)
Looking back (Looking back)
If this is for the best
Then tell me why it hurts so bad (Hurts so bad)

[Chorus]
Don't let go when the daylight's gone (Light's gone)
'Cause it's always darkest before the dawn
I breathe (Oh, I breathe)
When the cold air starts filling up my lungs (My lungs)
When I hate the things that I've become
I breathe (Oh, I breathe)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Ooh, ooh
Breathe (Oh, I breathe)
Ooh
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Ooh, ooh
Breathe

[Outro]
Sand keeps slipping right through my hands
Days all feel the same, still numb from you

[Verse 1]
I don't believe in fate
No psychic vision
But when things fall into place - superposition
In any universe you are my dark star

[Chorus]
I want you to want me
Why don’t we rely on chemistry
Why don't we collide the spaces that divide us
I want you to want me

[Post-Chorus]
La-di-da-la-di-da
La-di-da-la-di-da
La-di-da-la-di-da

[Verse 2]
Superstition aims with imprecision
But when things can't be explained - superposition
Oh, oh, in any universe you are my dark star

[Chorus]
I want you to want me
Why don’t we rely on chemistry
Why don't we collide the spaces that divide us
I want you to want me

[Post-Chorus]
La-di-da-la-di-da
La-di-da-la-di-da
La-di-da-la-di-da
I want you to want me

[Bridge]
No matter what we do
I'll be there with you

[Chorus]
I want you to want me
Why don't we rely on chemistry
Why don't we collide the spaces that divide us
I want you to want me

[Post-Chorus]
La-di-da-la-di-da
La-di-da-la-di-da
La-di-da-la-di-da
La-di-da-la-di-da
La-di-da-la-di-da
La-di-da-la-di-da

[Verse 1]
Mother Mary pray for me I don't think I'm around
Left about a week ago to someone who was found
Pulled up to a dark red house that didn't have a light
She said, "Okay, let's check-in for the night"

[Verse 2]
Met somebody else's wife, she asked "How are you?"
I don't know what goes through me, but sometimes I see blue
Every time I go down there it's always way too hot
Every time I get too scared it's always way too hot
Mmm, oh my

[Outro]
Didn't you're mama teach you right
Didn't you're mama teach you right

[Bonus Song]
Ahh, give me give me what you want
I'll tell you what I need
I need something that is real (yeah)
Give me give me what you want, 'cause I don't have what I need
And give me something I can feel

[Intro]
Mmmm
Mmmm

[Verse]
Got lost again
Around 25th
No one saw me go
Ssh
Damn, I made it out
I did what I was
Supposed to do
Mother nature couldn't tell
If this is all a lie I don't care
Oh well

[Verse 2]
(ooh)
Blue-ish haze
(ooh)
In my face
(ooh)
Acid wash
Drip drip drip (woo)
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Hello, you are about to listen to A Real Good Kid. The album is 40 minutes long and is meant to be listened to in one sitting, straight through. It is meant to be listened to without texting, without emailing, without outside distraction of any sort. If at this time you are unable to devote 40 minutes of undivided attention, I politely ask you turn this off and return at a later time.

It's hard to describe how I feel right now. People keep asking what happened to me. What happened to me? The answer is this.

[Verse 1: Ezra Koenig]
Sunflower in the morning
Standing in the garden
All before you wake
No power can compel you
Out into the daylight
Let that evil wait

[Chorus: Ezra Koenig]
Strange thought upon the pillow
"What day demands a date?"
Well, I don't know

[Scatting: Steve Lacy]

[Verse 2: Ezra Koenig]
Sunflower in the evening
Standing in the garden
Taking up that space
No power can compel me
Back into the daylight
Let that evil wait

[Chorus: Ezra Koenig]
Strange thought upon the pillow
"What day demands a date?"
Well, I don’t know

[Scatting: Steve Lacy]

[Outro: Ezra Koenig]
You know

[Verse 1]
Surrounded with only noise
I seem to tune it out
I just wanna hear your voice
And you need to say it loud
They can't distract me from our love
Once I'm in, I'm fully in
Giving a fraction ain't enough, no, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna get between so they can be someone, whoa
Tryna intervene 'cause they don't have no one (No one)

[Chorus]
Oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa
Yea ya, yea ya, yea ya
Yea ya, yea ya, yea ya
Oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa
Yea ya, yea ya, yea ya
Yea ya, yea ya, yea ya

Yea ya, yea ya, yea ya
Yea ya, yea ya, yea ya
Yea ya, yea ya, yea ya
Yea ya, yea ya, yea ya
Yea ya, yea ya, yea ya

[Verse 2]
Everybody wanna be something
Everybody wanna find their love
If you believe in something then you can get enough
Everybody wanna be something
Everybody wanna find their love
If you believe in something then you can get enough

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna get between so they can be someone
Tryna intervene 'cause they don't have no one (No one)

[Chorus]
Oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa
Yea ya, yea ya, yea ya
Yea ya, yea ya, yea ya

If you believe in something then you can get enough (Oh, whoa)
Yea ya, yea ya
Yea ya, yea ya

[Verse 1: Toro y Moi]
Good morning to you, I hope you're feeling better, baby
Thinking of me while you are far away
Counting the days until they set you free again
Writing this letter hoping you're okay

Saved you the room you used to stay in every Sunday
The one that is warmed by sunshine every day
And we'll get to know each other for a second time
And then you can tell me 'bout your prison stay

[Chorus: Toro y Moi and Anthony Ferraro]
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Feels so good you're coming home soon

[Refrain: Toro y Moi]
It's gonna to be good to have you back again with me
Watching the laughter play around your eyes
Come up and fetch you, saved up for the train fare money
Kiss and make up and it will be so nice

[Chorus: Toro y Moi and Anthony Ferraro]
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Feels so good you're coming home soon

[Bridge: Toro y Moi]
Walking the way we used to walk
And it could be so nice
We're talking the way we used to talk
And it could be so nice

[Refrain]
It's gonna be good to have you back again with me
Watching the laughter play around your eyes
Come up and fetch you, saved up for the train fare money
Kiss and make up and it will be so nice

[Chorus: Toro y Moi and Anthony Ferraro]
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba
Feels so good you're coming home soon
You look so funny to me
When you pretend to be something you could never be
You try to make us think you live a tough life
But you've got your daddy's money so you'll always get by
There's a little bit of hip missing from you're hop
You're from beverly hills stop pretending you're not
You're the full ten baby all of the way
You will never be south central LA

Got your Air Force Ones and your Sean John jeans
Way too big hanging down to your knee's
Can you tell me what's up with the "what up G's"
You're just a wanna be, you're just a wanna be

You've got your twenty inch rims bouncin' up to the club
If you're not keepin' it real you're gonna get no love
Never seen the streets, never smelled them once
You're just a wanna be, you're just a wanna be

We all know you've got it made
Drive around town in you're escalade
No matter how you fight to fix it right
You're just a trust fund baby on the inside
I'll admit for me life hasn't been too tough
I've got my own problems but they ain't that rough
You can act the part you can wear the clothes
You can talk the talk everybody knows
Everybody knows yeah...
Got your Air Force Ones and your Sean John jeans
Way too big hanging down to your knee's
Can you tell me what's up with the "what up G's"
You're just a wanna be, you're just a wanna be

You've got your twenty inch rims bouncin' up to the club
If you're not keepin' it real you're gonna get no love
Never seen the streets, never smelled them once
You're just a wanna be, you're just a wanna be

Just hanging with your homies, out on a Friday night
Turn up the bass it's time to ride
Now don't forget the shorties all up in the club tonight
Time for you to show me all you're ice ice
Baby boy

Got your Air Force Ones and your Sean John jeans
Way too big hanging down to your knee's
Can you tell me what's up with the "what up G's"
You're just a wanna be, you're just a wanna be

You've got your twenty inch rims bouncin' up to the club
If you're not keepin' it real you're gonna get no love
Never seen the streets, never smelled them once
You're just a wanna be, you're just a wanna be

Who wanna put it on me? Where they at
I know some shawties in here, where they at? Where they at?
Who wanna put it on me? Where they at

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I need a girl who ain’t scared to go to beaches
Be down to get a little freaky
Work can get that money on the weekday
And "take care daddy," cause she know just what I need
I need, I need, I need a little attitude
I wish a b**** would be looking at a dude
Yeah I need a smart, be doing it in the class
Oh, she can't tell me what she doing with all that ass
I need swag that compliment mine
Walking her own two while I'm stomping in mine
And I don’t care what no one in the world say
Do you think I need a girl, Trey?

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Baby, please believe me when I tell you that, I need a girl, need a girl
So come on pretty lady won't you holla back? I need a girl, I'ma tell you what I need
I need a girl that's gon' be my baby, so if you love me say "I'm your baby"
So fine I go "That's my baby", so if you need me say "You're my baby"

[Verse 2: Teyana Taylor]
I’m a woman, I get my at my own cash
I ain’t looking for someone to put my own bills on
Like a woman, I ain't never gotta ask
I ain’t just another girl you could trick on
So, little lady driving the boys crazy
Oh, you the only one I want
Boy I'm waiting, down the patient
And today is the day that you face it, woah
Know that I will love you for who you are cause I adore (Who you are)

[Intro]
What goes around, comes back around (Hey, my baby!)
What goes around, comes back around (My, my, my baby!)
I say, what goes around comes back around (Hey, my baby!)
What goes around comes back around

[Verse 1]
There was a time I thought
That you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy, I must've been out of my mind

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
Thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you, so baby, good looking out

[Chorus 1]
I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
You turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'm gon' always be the best thing you never had
I bet it sucks to be you right now

[Verse 2]
So sad, you're hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care?
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When I think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass, and baby, yes, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
Thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you, baby, good looking out

[Chorus 2]
I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
I said, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'll never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

[Bridge]
I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away
Lord knows that it would take another place, another time
Another world, another life
Thank God, I found the good in goodbye

[Chorus 3]
I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I will always be the best thing you never had
Ooh, best thing you never had
I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Ooh, I will never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

[Outro]
What goes around, comes back around
What goes around, comes back around
(I bet it sucks to be you right now)
What goes around, comes back around
(I bet it sucks to be you right now)
What goes around, comes back around
(I bet it sucks to be you right now)
What goes around, comes back around
(I bet it sucks to be you right now)

Your spinal cord is gettin' popped like a cork in wine

Chyeah

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
When I was just a little one (Uh-huh), I did sit still once
My cousins used to call me Hit-N-Run
I learned a lot from my homies and a lot from my fam
All my, all my peoples really made me who I am (Yup)
My grandma passed, I was savin' her a dance
I didn’t understand why I never got the chance (Why'd you take her?)
But if it's anything she taught me, never give up
My enemies is waitin’ for a slip-up (Nope)
So when I'm down, I get up (Get up)
Clock is tickin', it's either rap shit or a spot in prison (Uh-uh)
I ain't got no, got no time to spare
Seats is fillin' up, better find a chair (Find a chair)
Sugar-sweet rhymes from the finest pears
And a lot comin' for me 'cause the grind is there (Uh-huh)
Well, I just had a little piece of mind to share
Face-up on Times Square, it look fine there (Chyeah)

[Chorus: John Record & Mac Miller]
If you notice that I love it, then make way as I make somethin’ of it (And that’s the way it go down)

In a theater near you, I'll be comin’ soon (But I'ma get back up into the second verse for y'all)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Aight, what?
There's a lot of speculation on my future as it is
Am I for real or just a can on the computer for the kids? (Uh-huh)
Not a damn thing right now is buzzin' in the biz
In Pittsburgh, "Well, he nothin' next to Wiz"
I address the class with class, a class act, oh
That's Mac, only 'bout the facts
Rap gettin' littered on, I'm pickin' up the trash
And this track gettin' shitted on, spittin' out the ass
I got cruel intentions (Uh-huh), usin' weapons (Chyeah)
And you a piece of shit I just stepped in (Stepped in)
I still do it for the city, do it for my block
A movie in your mind, I do it for hip-hop

[Chorus: John Record & Mac Miller]
If you notice that I love it, then make way as I make somethin' of it (I do it for hip-hop)
In due time, in this grind (

[?])
In a theater near you (I do it for hip-hop), I'll be comin' soon (So we gon' take it to the top)
In a theater near you, I'll be comin' soon (I do it for hip-hop)

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
One time
The kid Mac, he be spittin' somethin' special
And I'm ready, hear the whistles from the kettle (Yep)
Shootin' missiles out my pencil with my pedal to the metal (Metal)
Startin' every day with a bowl of Fruity Pebbles
Then I'm gone, things are never gon' change (Change)
Words released out this little thing I call my brain (Yep)
And you're all insane thinkin' I'm in class, 'cause I'm hatin' school (Uh-huh)
Breakin' rules, haven't been to school in a day or two
To name a few, 'cause it's killin' me to study
It really isn't funny, seemin' sillier than putty (Haha)
I'm just chillin', burnin' Dutchies while I'm supposed to be in class (What?)
I pass grass to get a laugh, supposed to be in math
I'm an abstract, class-act cat with my hat back (Hat back)
Bitches holdin' onto blunts, better pass that
Gettin' high, findin' anything to laugh at (Haha)
'Cause we gon' take it to the top

[Chorus: John Record]
If you notice that I love it, then make way as I make somethin' of it
In due time, in this grind (

In a theater near you, I'll be comin' soon
In a theater near you, I'll be comin' soon

When you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again

[Verse 2]
I've got a way of knowin' when somethin' is right
I feel like I must've known you in another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection
When you looked in my eyes
(I can't wait)
Now I can't wait to see you again

[Chorus]
The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't wait to see you again

[Verse 3]
I got this crazy feelin' deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader, but I'm readin' the sign
(That you can't wait)
That you can't wait to see me again

[Chorus]
The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't wait to see you again

[Bridge]
I got my sights set on you, and I'm ready to aim

[Chorus]
The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't wait to see you again

[Outro]
(To see you again)
(To see you again)
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't wait to see you again

Bonsoir Paris... Put your f. hands up!

[Verse 1]
Come to me
In all your glamour and cruelty
Just do that thing that you do
And I'll und* you
Keep it tight
Sometimes the simplest move is right
The melody that you choose can rescue you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTP*P could mean anything
Put your hands up Paris !

[Chorus]
We could, we could belong together ARTP*P
We could, we could belong together ARTP*P
We could, we could belong together ARTP*P, ARTP*P, ARTP*P

Come to me
With all your subtext and fantasy
Just do that thing that you do
In a p* hue
Lcvers' kites are flown on beaches for public sight
The color palette you choose could profit you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings!
My ARTP*P could mean anything
PUT YOUR PAWS UP !
Could try to sell you out
Or I could show you all the reasons why
My ARTP*P could mean anything *walk to piano*
JE VOUS ADORE PARIS! *plays*

[Chorus]
We could, we could belong together
We could, we could belong together
We could, we could belong together ARTP*P, ARTP*P, ARTP*P

[Bridge]
Brushes with darkness won't help you create
Your destiny of self, but ARTP*P could mean anything, anything.. ! SING IT WITH ME!!! *plays*
I try to sell myself, but I am really laughing *shake head*
Because I just love the music, not the bling !
The music, not the bling !

We need you more than dxpe..

[Outro]
My heart would break without you..
Might not awake without you..
Been hurting low from living high for so long.. *vibratos*
I'm sorry, we lxve you..
Stay.. with you

You taste like w* when you k* me, oh
I'd give anything again to be your baby doll
This time I’m not leaving without you

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
He said, "Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and you said to me,"

[Chorus: Lady Gaga + Brian May]
Something, something about this place. *shake body*
Something, something, ‘bout l* nights
And my lipstick on your face..

[Bridge]
We got a whole lot of money, but we still pay rent
'Cause you can't buy a house in Heaven
There's only three men that I'ma serve my whole life
It's my daddy, and Nebraska, and Jesus Christ

There's..something, something, something about the chase
Six whole years
I'm a New York woman born to run you down
Still want my lipstick all over your face!
Something, something about
Just knowing when it's right
So put your drinks up

-Born this way-

So I heard there was a rally here a couple weeks ago
I heard that a million very right wing conservative people spoke out against gay marriage in France
F those F people
Those people do not represent the true perspective of this country. They are extremely conservative, extremely right-wing, and all that we have to do, all that you have to do is be louder than them
Because you are on the right side of history, you are on the side of love, the side of acceptance, the side of tolerance
So don’t you let them bring you down, don’t you let them think they’re setting you back ‘cause they’re not, they’re just a F bunch of winey b*s
I don’t mean that as fighting words but, you know, it’s 2014 and people are getting together

[Verse 1]
My mama told me when I was young
We're all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause He made you perfect, babe"
"So hold your head up, la France you'll go far
Listen to me when I say"!

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself, and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

[Verse 2]
Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital "H"im
Hey, hey, hey
I love my life, I love this friends and
Mi amore vole fe yah! yeah-ah!

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes!
I'm on the right track, baby
*point mic*
Don't hide yourself
*point mic*
*plays*

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way!
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way
Ooh, there ain't no other way

[Pause]
So, if you are living in France, whether you’re young, or old, or in the middle, if you’re gay, hold your head up high and be F proud and live your life
And if anybody here feels uncomfortable with this conversation you probably shouldn’t have come to this concert. Here we spread love with every invention that we make. You don’t have to feel invisible, you don’t have to feel like you don’t matter

[Bridge]
No matter gay, straight, or bi
Lesbian, transgender life! *hold notes*
Your on the right track, baby
You are born to survive
No matter black, white, or beige
Paris..
We're all born superstars!
*plays*
I'm on the edge of glory
And I’m hangin' on a moment of truth
I'm on the edge of glory
And I’m hangin' this moment baby with you..
I'm on the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, The Edgeee ! Yah !

-Judas-

Ah ah. Sh's about to get evil, JUDAAAAAASS!
PUT YOUR HANDS UP! LEVEZ VOUS LA FRANCE! LEVEZ VOUS! LET'S FUCK SHOUT! COME ON!

[Verse 1]
When he calls to me, I am ready
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times he betrays me

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
A king with no crown, king with no crown

[Chorus]
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It’s so cruel, but I’m still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It’s so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah

GAGAAAAHHH!!!!
PUT YOUR HANDS UP! JUMP OFF THE TRUNK! GO!

[Verse 1]
I'm not a wandering slave, I am a woman of choice..
My veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face!
You ought to pity me 'cause was arranged one man to love
But in the bedroom, the size of him's more than enough

[Chorus]
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?
Behind the aura, behind the aura, clap your hands..
BEHIND THE BURQAA!!!
NOW JUMP! RAVEE!!! YEEEAHHH!!!

-Sexxx Dreams-

Gimme a beat Spanky
At the artrave, nothing is what it seems
So I close my eyes, I think about you
And I have the Sexxx Dreams, the Sexxx Dreams
Ah, ha, ha

[Verse 1]
Our lovers' quarrel
Hurts more than I can say
All night
Help me here!
Help me here!

'Cause I can't help my mind from going there!

[Pre-Chorus]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you

[Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my Sexxx Dreams
Doing really nasty things
Damn, you were in my Sexxx Dreams
Making love in my Sexxx Dreams

[Bridge]
You could turn to stone
Or the color of men petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him

[Spoken Interlude]
Is anybody drunk yet? C'MON!
Put your hands up!

[Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my Sexxx Dreams
Doing really nasty things
Damn, you were in my Sexxx Dreams
Making love in my Sexxx Dreams

-Mary Jane Holland-

Grab your drinks and spark it world. Let's relax, shall we?
Hands in the air! Let's party!

[Verse 1]
Lady of the 'Dam
Won't be a slave to the blonde, or the culture of the popular
She won't, she won't
Sing at you, I'll fly under radar tonight
Make deals with every devil in sight
I will, I will

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I love, love, 'cause I love, love
You better than, you better than
My darkest sin
Russian hookers, and cheap gin

[Chorus]
I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me Mary Jane Holland tonight

[Post-Chorus]
Mary Jane Holland!
Mary Jane Holland!

Oh Paris, I know my mom and that think I'm a mess…
But it's alright, because I am rich as piss
When I ignite the flames and put you in my mouth
The grass eats up my insides, and my brunette starts to sprout
Introducing, ladies and gentleman, Mary Jane Holland

INTRODUCING, LE PARISIEN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MARY, JANE,  HOLLAND!
HANDS UP MOTHERFUCKERS

[Chorus]
I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me and Mary Jane Holland tonight

I THINK WE, I THINK WE, I THINK WE!!

Oh, IN. Oh, OH…

-Alejandro-

Ohh, uuh, yeeah baby… Oh I feel much better… more relaxed… ohh, the grass is very green in paris…,... yeh, oh i just feel even lighter, and maybe I…
I know that we are young and I know that you may love me, but I just can't be with you like this anymore, Alejandro

Oh-oh-oh-oohooh…
I'm free with you, GET OUT OF HERE!

[Verse 1]
She's got both hands in her pocket
And she won't look at you, won't look at you!
She hides true love, en su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger, around you!

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I love you boy!
Hot like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Hands up Paris !

[Chorus]
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Roberto
Levez les mains, Chantez avec moi !
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

[Bridge]
Don't bother me, don't bother me
Alejandro
Don't call my name, don't call my name
Bye, Fernando
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe

Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch
C'mon !
Don't call my name, don't call my name
Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe
Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch

C'mon sing it LET'S GO !

[Outro]
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro !

[Verse 1]
Too much near the truth they say
Keep it till another day
Let them have their little game
Delusion helps to keep them sane
Let them have their little toys
Matchbox cars and mortgaged joys
Exciting in their plastic ways
Frozen food in a concrete maze

[Chorus]
You're gonna go insane
I’m trying to save your brain

[Verse 2]
All right!
I don't know what's happening
My head’s all torn inside
People say I'm heavy
They don't know what I hide
Take a life, it's going cheap
Kill someone, no one will weep
Freedom's yours, just pay your dues
We just want your soul to use

[Chorus]
You're gonna go insane
I'm trying to save your brain

[Snoop Dogg]
Remember man, '92, me, Dre, Tha Pound, Rage, it was just all about, you know what I'm sayin', Death Row
As time went by, you know, niggas start having money, success, bitches, weed, cars, homes, you know what I'm sayin', the flyest shit
Along with that comes jealousy, envy, destruction, and along those lines run life and death
You know, so a few years went by, a couple albums, success, out of the blue sky Dre departs, he leaves us
Death Row, will we sink or will we stay afloat?
Later on that year, I lose my nigga Pac, damn, it's a cold world
Guess it's all on me, Death Row for life
Gotsta handle my business...on the frontline....as usual

[Bloodstone Sample]
Oh but what will you say
If I never set foot in your door again
What will you say to your friends then
Will you tell them
Who has the last laugh now

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
One lil, two lil, three lil G's
Hangin' on the dope spot slangin' they keys
Four lil, five lil, six lil cops
Leanin' in the cut, 'bout to get popped
Not, knowin' I'm scopin' on the roof
I got my red beam, better have ya bulletproof
Cause the light don't miss once I put it to ya dome
They got my homies jacked, now they reachin' for they chrome
Al Capone was a hero of mine
I've shot plenty niggas and cops, so fuck one time
Where they at? where they at? oh, they in the back
So I gotsta take my time and make sure that my nine
Get him, got him, spot him, shoot him, he's shot
And now they call me Snoop Gotti
I'm like a fugitive, Harrison Ford
Slidin' in the Chevy now the shit's gettin' heavy
But you know I can't choke so I call my nigga Loc
Gotta find the hideaway and a big bag of smoke
Can't be fuckin' wit' my niggas while they makin' they dope
Cause if ya slippin', ya fallin' asleep on Death Row

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Now some muthafucka done snitched on me
And the judge just sentenced me to do about a century
I'm mobbin' through the county main line
Back in 9500, just tryna handle mines
Spittin' game at my homies about the good ol' days
As we try to pass time, waitin' for the chains
To Chino, I see no reason to cry
When a nigga's still alive, right?
Five o'clock wake up, call roll, call Doggy Dogg
Be at the chow hall from there I roam the yard
Still representin' to the fullest, so you know what time it is
I shank a nigga in a minute, abiding rules of the pen
I adapt quick, don't take shit from no nigga
Hittin' pushups by the g's to get bigger
Eight months, I'm on swole, my mind's clearer
Everyday of my life I take a glimpse in the mirror
And guess what the fuck I'm startin' to see
I still regulate sleepin' in the penitentiary

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
It's like everywhere I look and everywhere I go
I'm hearing muthafuckas tryna steal my flow
But it ain't no thang, cause see my nigga Coolio
Put me up on the game when I stepped in the door
You know some of you niggas is so deceptive
Using my styles like a contraceptive
I hope you get burnt
Seems you haven't learnt
It's the knick-knack, patty-whack
I still got the biggest sack!
So put your gun away, run away, cause I'm back
Why? hit em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up
Now, tell me, what's going on?
It make me wanna holler, cause my dollars come in O-zones
Known for break off so take off your clothes
And quit trying to spit at my motherfuckin' hoes!
Speaking of hoes, I kick in the doors
Put my nuts on ya chin and the story goes

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Why do bitch-ass niggas always talk shit
But don't when it's time to get wrecked, checked, and ripped?
I knew he was a hoe
Ready to turn a trick and I can tell from his lips that my dick would fit
I've split, gums
You didn't know dumb-da-ditty-dumb
And my shit do harm so run, ring the alarm
I thought you knew I'm looney like Tony Montana
In the mix running shit, oops and um...
The smoothest, coolest, ruthless ya know
On a kamikaze mission (ooh, if I can be like Snoop)
Keep wishing, listen
With my balls in ya jaws, make room to put my dick in
As I walk through
This wicked world
Searchin' for light in the darkness of insanity
I ask myself
Is all hope lost?
Is there only pain and hatred, and misery?

And each time I feel like this inside
There's one thing I wanna know:
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding?
Oh, what's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding?

And as I walked on
Through troubled times
My spirit gets so downhearted sometimes
So where are the strong
And who are the trusted?
And where is the harmony?
Sweet harmony

'Cause each time I feel it slippin' away, just makes me wanna cry
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding?
Oh, what's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding?
So where are the strong?
And who are the trusted?
And where is the harmony?
Sweet harmony

'Cause each time I feel it slippin' away, just makes me wanna cry
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding?
Oh, what's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding?
Oh, what's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding?
Lyrics From Snippet

[Verse]
I'm like Lenox up on Lenox, don’t do scare bidness
I rode to the park, in the back of the back like Rosa and Parks (oh, yeah)
Rolling this bitch with a twin, can't tell us apart (ah)
They sayin' no 

[?]

[Intro: Scarface & A$AP Rocky]
You know why I got this scar on my face? Huh?
You know why I got this scar on my face man?
They call me Scarface man
Are you fucking shitting me man?
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah
Yeah, uh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse: A$AP Rocky]
Hopped out the jam
Just to hop up on his jams
Hopped out of the bed
For some breakfast toast and jams
Butter with the spread
Fixed my OJ with the jams
Ducking from the fans
Like a nigga facing 10
Hopped out the jam
Just to hop up on his jams
Hopped out of the bed
For some breakfast toast and jams
Butter with the spread
Fixed my OJ with the jams
Ducking from the fans
Like a nigga facing 10

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
I ain't tryna spend time behind no pen (Hell nah)
I ain't tryna spend time behind no pen (Hell nah)
I ain't tryna spend time behind no pen (Hell nah)
I ain't tryna spend time behind no pen (Hell nah)
Listen to this rhyme, they taking your time
It's like you're in prison when you don't use your mind
Rise up and shine, they taking your time
It's like you're in prison when you don't use your mind

Eleven million people unemployed and I'm one of them
I grew up with the rats and roaches I had fun with them
Fly sneaks' and fine clothes, I had none of them
But when I came to MC rhymes I had a ton of them
People tell me go get a job, I would run from them
I saw the workforce and work was no fun for them
No beach, no melanin, no Sun for them
With slave robbing bosses why would I come under them?
So at 7 am you wake up from sleep
At 7 am I wake up and take a leak
At 7:05 you got slippers on your feet
At 7:07 I'm going right back to sleep
At 7:15 you thinking about today's meeting
At 7:30 am, my friend, I'm still sleeping
At 7:45, your phone start beeping
Old text messages from yesterday's meeting
8 am you leaving it's freezing
You're feeling unworthy trying to get the work before 9:30
9:45 I'm just turning over
9:45 man, you looking over your shoulder
Here comes the boss looking for that folder
And you know within your folder, you didn't meet your quota
Now 11 o'clock's to bone ya', your boss says where's the folder?
And you feel like you a goner
Well, you simply gotta make it up
But 11 o'clock ops KRS just waking up
Linger in the bed to about 11:30
Spit a morning  prayer, I hope heaven heard me
Stand up at about 12 o'clock, you on your lunch break
I'm just eating breakfast vegetarian cupcakes
1 o'clock, you back at your desk, back at the office
Back into stress, your desk is a mess
Listen to this rhyme, they taking your time
It's like you're in prison when you don't use your mind
Rise up and shine, they taking your time
It's like you're in prison when you don't use your mind

You doing your best but your best ain't enough
You wanna do less but less, makes it rough
It's 101 in the public and private sector
Either way I'm giving a conference at 4 pm a lecture
Topic, while I check my other appointments
Cause hip hop is a culture in lifetime employment
See, back in the days,  to avoid getting jerk
We was told to go to college in case rap didn't work
Now today, not to be so hurt
You better know how to rap in case your degree don't work
Man, you better get the lesson, and stop stressing
MC and a DJ and a high paying profession
So if you need to - don't let them deceive you
You ain't got to believe me, it's time you believe you!

Listen to this rhyme, they taking your time
It's like you're in prison when you don't use your mind
Rise up and shine, they taking your time
It's like you're in prison when you don't use your mind
Lyrics from snippet

Pass your life, pass your life
What 

[?] Pass it
Put it high
As high as you need and watch me grab it (hey)
Fuck you slow, in the backseat
Yeah she snatching
All mine if you call me slime I'm your daddy
I was walking down the beach
At San Onofre
It was such a beautiful day
Like most days
The wind was blowin' through my hair
Sunlight chased my cares away
And the sun dances in the morning sky

When you're driving through L.A
Watch the cliffs below
On beautiful Laguna Street Arch Bay
The wind was blowin' through my hair
Sunlight chased my cares away
And the sun dances through the morning sky

California feelin' (4x)

When you're down in New York City
And the sky turns grey
Nearly froze think of Californ-i-a
Ah
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Do doo doo doo doo doo ah

California feelin' (5x)

Look at the orange groves
And taste a grapefruit from a grapefruit tree
Feel the loveliness and beauty
Of that California feeling
Feelin'

[Intro]
(Coughing)

[Verse 1]
Alright now
Won't you listen?
When I first met you, didn't realize
I can't forget you or your surprise
You introduced me to my mind
And left me wanting you and your kind
Oh, yeah!

[Verse 2]
I love you
Oh, you know it
My life was empty, forever on a down
Until you took me, showed me around
My life is free now, my life is clear
I love you, sweet leaf, though you can't hear
Oh, yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Come on now
Try it out
Straight people don't know what you're about
They put you down and shut you out
You gave to me a new belief
And soon the world will love you, sweet leaf
Oh, yeah, baby!

[Outro]
Come on now! Oh, yeah!
Try me out, baby! Alright!
Oh, yeah-ah! I want you part of this sweet leaf!
Oh, yeah! Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, try-y me-e o-out
I love you, sweet leaf, oh
Verse 1]
Well, I'm leaving tomorrow at daybreak
Catch the fastest train that I find
Yes, I’m leaving the sorrow and heartaches
Before it takes me away from my mind

[Verse 2]
Send me love, and I may let you see me
Send me hopes I can fit in my head
But if you really want me to answer
I can only let you know when I'm dead

[Bridge]
When sadness fills my days
It's time to turn away
And then tomorrow’s dreams
Become reality to me

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
So realize I'm much better without you
You're not the one and only thing in my heart
I'll just go back to pretending I'm living
So this time I'm gonna have the star part

[Verse 1]
Well, people look and people stare
Well, I don’t think that I even care
You work your life away and what do they give?
You’re only killing yourself to live

[Refrain]
Killing yourself to live
Killing yourself to live

[Verse 2]
Just take a look around you, what do you see?
Pain, suffering, and misery
It’s not the way that the world was meant
It’s a pity, you don’t understand

[Refrain]
Killing yourself to live
Killing yourself to live

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
I’m telling you, believe in me
Nobody else will tell you
Open your eyes and see the lies, oh yeah
(Smoke it, get high)
You think that I’m crazy and, baby, I know that it’s true
Before that you know it I think that you’ll go crazy, too

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
I don’t know if I’m up or down
Whether black is white or blue is brown
The colors of my life are all different somehow
Little boy blue’s a big girl now
So you think it’s me who’s strange
But you’ve never had to make the change
Never give your trust away
You’ll end up payin' ’til your dyin' day

[Verse 1]
What you get and what you see
Things that don’t come easily
Feeling happy in my pain
Icicles within my brain (Cocaine)

[Verse 2]
Something blowing in my head
Winds of ice that soon will spread
Down to freeze my very soul
Makes me happy, makes me cold

[Chorus]
My eyes are blind, but I can see
The snowflakes glisten on the tree
The sun no longer sets me free
I feel the snowflakes freezing me

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Let the winter sunshine on
Let me feel the frost of dawn
Build my dreams on flakes of snow
Soon I’ll feel the chilling glow

[Bridge]
Right!
Don’t you think I know what I’m doing
Don’t tell me that it’s doing me wrong
You’re the one that’s really the loser
This is where I feel I belong
Right!

[Verse 4]
Kiss the world with winter flowers
Turn my days to frozen hours
Lying snowblind in the sun
Will my ice age ever come?

[Verse 1]
Revolution in their minds
The children start to march
Against the world in which they have to live
And all the hate that's in their hearts
They’re tired of being pushed around and told just what to do
They'll fight the world until they've won
And love comes flowing through, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Children of tomorrow live
In the tears that fall today
Will the sunrise of tomorrow bring in
Peace in any way?
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?
Can they win the fight for peace or
Will they disappear? Yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
So you children of the world
Listen to what I say
If you want a better place to live in
Spread the word today
Show the world that love is still alive, you must be brave
Or you children of today are
Children of the grave, yeah!

[Outro]
Children of the grave
Children of the grave

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcerers of death's construction
In the fields, the bodies burnin'
As the war machine keeps turnin'
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisonin' their brainwashed minds
Oh, Lord, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that all to the poor, yeah!
Time will tell on their power minds
Makin' war just for fun
Treatin' people just like pawns in chess
Wait 'til their judgment day comes, yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Now, in darkness, world stops turnin'
Ashes where their bodies burnin'
No more war pigs have the power
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of Judgment, God is callin'
On their knees, the war pigs crawlin'
Beggin' mercies for their sins
Satan, laughin', spreads his wings
Oh, Lord, yeah

[Guitar Intro]

[Verse 1]
Finished with my woman, 'cause she couldn't help me
With my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frowning
All the time
All day long, I think of things, but nothing seems
To satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something
To pacify

[Chorus]
Can you help me
Occupy my brain?
Oh, yeah!

[Verse 2]
I need someone to show me the things in life
That I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh
And I will cry
Happiness, I cannot feel and love, to me
Is so unreal
And so, as you hear these words telling you now
Of my state
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could
But it's too late

[Intro]
Oh, oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Come on)
Ayy, oh, oh
Yo, wassup, ma?
Ooh, what happened to you last night?
Yeah, oh
Whatever, never mind then
Yeah, oh
But meet me tonight
Oh, you up for it?
Are you game? Ooh, ooh
You sure? Alright
Yeah, oh
Meet me later
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm the fire to your flame
Thought process to your brain
Make you wanna change your name
So I can be your man
And game on 'til you can
Start humming 'til you sing
Really remove your pain
'Cause I feel it too

[Pre-Chorus]
Is there something I can change?
I bet that I can hang
But there's something we must do
Let's meet tonight, you scared? Meet me

[Chorus]
Meet me tonight
Come inside, alright
Creeping out my window too
Just to meet you (Under the streetlights)
We can meet if you like
I'll be out 'bout 9
We can be me and you
At night, carefree (Under the streetlights)

[Verse 2]
You can see me from a distance
In white and leather fitted
For a sponser, 

[?]
So I grab my 

[?]
Burn fire from the floor
Let me burn the floor
Just in case you didn't know
I would have to tell you so

[Pre-Chorus]
Is there something I can change?
I bet that I can hang
But there's something you must do
If you'd like to kick

[Chorus]
Meet me tonight
Come inside, alright
Creeping out my window too
Just to meet you (Under the streetlights)
We can meet if you like
I'll be out 'bout 9
We can be me and you
At night, carefree (Under the streetlights)

[Bridge]
Sometimes you have to break the rules
And show a little attitude
How do you know what you will miss
If you don't try?
(Go)
(Come on, come on)
(Come on, come on)
(Come on, come on, come on)
(Come on, come on, come on)
(1, 1, 2, 3, come on)

[Chorus]
Meet me tonight
Come inside, alright
Creeping out my window too
Just to meet you (Under the streetlights)
We can meet if you like
I'll be out 'bout 9
We can be me and you
At night, carefree (Under the streetlights)

[Outro]
Oh, yeah
No, babe, yeah
Don't worry

No, babe, yeah

I'm with you, yeah, yeah
Oh

[Verse 1]
Electric lights
Blow my mind
But I feel alright
Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die
You catch my eye
Bitch, you wanna fly?
I'm so alive

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to school, I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque, getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school, I just wanna break the rules

[Verse 2]
I'm such a star
Queen Boulevard
Blaze through the dark
Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to school, I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque, getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school, I just wanna break the rules

[Bridge]
Get my guitar
Sunglasses on
So light it up
Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to school, I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque, getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school, I just wanna break the rules

[Outro]
(Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na)
(Boys and girls across the world putting on our dancing shoes
Boys and girls across the world putting on our dancing shoes
Boys and girls across the world putting on our dancing shoes
Boys and girls across the world putting on our dancing shoes)

[Intro]
You good, T-Minus?

[Refrain]
Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Verse 1]
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

[Refrain]
Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Chorus]
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

[Verse 2]
I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

[Chorus]
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

[Outro]
Money in your palm don't make you real
Pistol in your hand don't make you real
Money in your palm don't make you real

[Chorus]
I've been trying to find myself
Love to hold, a love to hold
I've been trying to find myself
Love to hold, a love to hold
I've been trying to find myself
Love to hold, a love to hold

[Post Chorus]
Love
It's been getting me down
Been looking so hard
Around these towns
Ain't easy to get
And so hard to keep
The harder I try
The harder it seems

[Chorus]
I've been trying to find myself
A love to hold, love to hold
I've been trying to find myself
A love to hold, a love to hold, a love to
I've been trying to find myself
A love to hold, a love to hold
I've been trying to find myself
A love to hold, a love to hold

[Verse 1]
I was drinking last night with a biker
And I showed him a picture of you
I said "Pal, get to know her, you'll like her"
Seemed like the least I could do
'Cause when he's charging his chopper
Up and down your carpeted hall
You will think me by contrast quite proper
Nevermind how I stumble and fall
Nevermind how I stumble and fall

[Chorus]
You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot
For a taste of your elegant pride
I may be going to hell in a bucket, baby
But at least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Yeah, at least I'm enjoying the ride

[Verse 2]
Ah, miss sweetie, little soft-core pretender
Somehow baby got hard as it gets
With her black leather chrome spiked suspenders
And her chair and her whip and her pets
Well, we know you're the reincarnation
Of the ravenous Catherine the Great
And we know how you love your ovations
And the Z-rated scenes you create
Yeah, the Z-rated scenes you create

[Chorus]
You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot
For a taste of your elegant pride
I may be going to hell in a bucket, baby
But at least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Yeah, at least I'm enjoying the ride

[Bridge]
You analyze me, attempt to despise me
And you laugh when I stumble and fall
There may come a day I will dance on your grave
If unable to dance I will crawl across it
Unable to dance I will crawl
Yeah, unable to dance I'll crawl, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
You must really consider the circus
'Cause it just might be your kind of zoo
I can't think of a place that's more perfect
For a person as perfect as you
And it's not like I'm leaving you lonely
'Cause I wouldn't know where to begin
But I know that you'll think of me only
When the snakes come marching in
Yeah, when the snakes come marching in

[Chorus]
You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot
For a taste of your elegant pride
I may be going to hell in a bucket, baby
But at least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride

[Outro]
Ooh, ride, ride, ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Woo, ride, ride, ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Ride, ride, ride
At least I'm enjoying, enjoying the ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying, enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Ride, ride, ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Ride, ride, ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying, enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Ride, enjoying the ride
Ride, at least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride, yeah
At least I'm enjoying the ride

[Verse 1]
There must be some kind of way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion here
I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plow men dig my earth
None will level on the line
Nobody of it is worth

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
No reason to get excited
The thief he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour's getting late

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
Barefoot servants came and went
Little children too
Outside in the distance
A wild cat did growl
And two riders were approachin'
And the wind began to howl

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
When I was just a little young boy
Papa said "Son, you'll never get far
I'll tell you the reason if you wanna know
'Cause child of mine, there isn't really very far to go"
Baby, baby wants a gold diamond ring
Wants it more than most any old thing
Well, when I get those jelly roll blues
Why, I'd go and get anything in this world for you
Down to the jewelry store packing a gun
"Wrap it up. I think I'll take this one"
"A thousand dollars please," the jewelry man said
Dupree, he said, "I'll pay this one off to you in lead"

[Chorus]
Well, you know son you just can't figure
First thing you know you're gonna pull that trigger
And it's no wonder your reason goes bad
Jelly roll will drive you stone mad

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Judge said, "Son, it's gonna cost you some time"
Dupree said, "Judge, you know that crossed my mind"
Judge said, "Fact it's gonna cost you your life"
Dupree said, "Judge, you know that seems to me to be about right"
Judge said "Son, I know your baby well
But that's a secret I can't ever tell"
Dupree said "Judge, well it's well understood
You got to admit that that sweet, sweet jelly's so good"

[Chorus]
Well, you know son you just can't figure
First thing you know you're gonna pull that trigger
And it's no wonder your reason goes bad
Jelly roll will drive you stone mad

[Outro]
Same old story and I know it's been told
Some like jelly jelly, some like gold
Many a man's done a terrible thing
Just to get that baby a shiny diamond ring

[Verse 1]
Well, there ain't nobody safer than someone who doesn't care
And it isn't even lonely when no one's ever there
I had a lot of dreams once, but some of them came true
The honey's sometimes bitter when fortune falls on you

[Chorus]
And you know I've been a soldier in the armies of the night
And I'll find the fatal error in what's otherwise alright
But here you're trembling like a sparrow, I will try with all my might
To give you just a little sweetness
Just a little light

[Verse 2]
I have always heard that virtue ought to be its own reward
But it never comes so easy when you're living by the sword
It's even harder to be heartless when you look at me that way
You're as mighty as the flower that will grow the stones away
Even though I been a stranger, full of irony and spite
Holding little but contempt for all things beautiful and bright
Something shines around you and it seems to my delight
To give me just a little sweetness
Just a little light

[Bridge]
This could be just another highway, coiled up in the night
You could be just another white-tail, baby, stranded on my brights
There's a tingling recognition
Like the sound of distant thunder
And I begin to wonder
If the love I've driven under won't ignite

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
So you know I've been a soldier in the armies of the night
And I'll find the fatal error in what's otherwise alright
Something shines around you and it seems to my delight
To give me just a little sweetness
Just a little light
To give me just a little sweetness
Just a little light
To give me just a little sweetness
Just a little light
To give me, to give me, to give me just a little sweetness
Just a little light

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning, I felt around for my shoes
That's when I knew I had them walkin' blues
I woke up this morning, looked around, and I felt around for my shoes
That's when I knew I had them old, mean old walkin' blues

[Verse 2]
Feel most like blowin' my lonesome horn
Woke up this mornin', what I had was gone
Gonna leave, leave my old lonesome home
Woke up this mornin', what I had was gone
What I had was gone

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Some people tell you the walkin' blues ain't bad
Worst old feelin' anyone's ever had
Don't let 'em tell you that the walkin' blues ain't so bad
Worst old feelin' I've most ever had
Ever had

[Verse 4]
Leaving in the mornin' if I have to ride the blind
Well, I've been mistreated and I don't mind dyin'
I wanna leave, even if I have to ride the blind
Well, I've been mistreated and I, and I don't mind dyin'
And I don't mind, and I don't mind

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
She got the Elgin movement from her head down to her toes
Breaking on a dollar 'most anywhere she goes
She got a Elgin movement from her head down to her toes
Breaking on a dollar 'most anywhere she goes, anywhere she goes

[Verse 6]
And I woke up this morning and I felt around for my shoes
That's when I knew I had them old walkin'  blues
I woke up this morning, I looked around, and I felt around for my shoes
That's when I knew I had them old, mean old walkin' blues

[Outro]
Walkin' blues, walkin' blues, walkin' blues, walkin' blues
Walkin' blues, walkin' blues, walkin' blues, walkin' blues
Walkin' blues, walkin' blues, walkin' blues, walkin' blues
Walkin' blues

[Verse 1]
There was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell
He had a beautiful daughter, the truth to you I'll tell
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell
She had sweethearts a plenty, and men of high degree
But none but Jack the sailor, her true love ever be
Oh, her true love ever be
Now, Jackie's gone a-sailing, with trouble on his mind
He's left his native country and his darling girl behind
Oh, his darling girl behind
She went down to a tailor shop and dressed in man's array
She climbed on board a vessel to convey herself away
Oh, convey herself away
Before you get on board, sir, your name we'd like to know
She smiled on her countenance, they call me Jack-A-Roe
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I see your waist is slender, your fingers they are small
Your cheeks too red and rosy to face the cannonball
Oh, to face the cannonball
I know my waist is slender, my fingers they are small
But it would not make me tremble to see ten thousand fall
Oh, to see ten thousand fall

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
The war soon being over, she went and looked around
Among the dead and wounded her darling boy she found
Oh, her darling boy she found
She picked him up on in her arms and carried him to the town
She sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds
Oh, to quickly heal his wounds
This couple they got married so well they did agree
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Oh, why not you and me?
Oh, why not you and me?

[Verse 1]
All the years combine, they melt into a dream
A broken angel sings from a guitar
In the end there's just a song comes crying up the night
Through all the broken dreams and vanished years

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Verse 2]
When all the cards are down, and nothing comes for free
There's just the pavement left and broken dreams
And when you hear that song comes crying like the wind
Down every lonely street that's ever been

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Bridge]
I've stayed in every blue-light cheap hotel, can't win for trying
Dust off those rusty strings just one more time
Gonna make them shine (Shine)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It all rolls into one, and nothing comes for free
There's nothing you can hold, for very long
And when you hear that song come crying like the wind
It seems like all this life was just a dream

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Verse 1]
Gonna see some good times, gonna get to ring that bell
I'm gonna see some good times
Sometimes you make up for when I'm not feeling well
I must be due some great times
'Cause right now I feel like hell

[Chorus]
Never trust a woman who wears her pants too tight
Never trust a woman who wears her pants too tight
She might love you tomorrow, but she'll be gone, she'll be gone tomorrow night

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Come tomorrow I'll get my pay and I'm gonna leave this town
Come tomorrow I'll get my pay
I'll get my pay and I'm gonna leave this motherfuckin' town
She don't really love me
There ain't no reason to stick around

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Gonna see some good times, gonna get to ring that bell
Gonna see some good, good, good, good, good times
Sometimes you make up for when I'm not feeling well
I must be due some great times
But if they don't come around here...

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I must be due some good times, some time to ring that bell
I'm gonna see some good times
Sometimes I make up, sometimes I make up, sometimes I make up
For when I'm not feeling well
I must be due some great times
But if they don't come, if they don't come around here
If they never come
If they don't come tomorrow, if they don't come next week
If they don't come next year
Ah, what the hell

[Verse 1]
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble
Ancient footprints are everywhere
You can almost think that you're seein' double
On a cold dark night on the Spanish Stairs

Got to hurry on back to my hotel room
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece
She promised she'd be right there with me
When I paint my masterpiece

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Oh, the hours I've spent inside the Colosseum
Dodging lions and wastin', wastin' time
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle
I could hardly stand to see 'em
Well, it sure has been a long hard climb

Train wheels runnin' through the back of my memory
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
Someday, life will be sweet like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I left Rome, then I landed in Brussels
On a flight so bumpy that I almost cried
Clergymen in uniform, yes, and young girls pullin' muscles
They cheered, happy when I got right

Newspapermen eating candy
Had to be held down by big police
Someday, everything gonna be different
When I paint my masterpiece
Someday, everything gonna be different
When I paint my masterpiece
When I paint my masterpiece

[Verse 1]
Julie catch a rabbit by his hair
Come back stepping, like to walk on air
Get back home where you belong
And don't you run off no more

Don't hang your head and let the two time roll
Grass shack nailed to a pine wood floor
Ask the time, baby, I don't know
Come back later, gonna let it show

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Here's a half dollar if you dare
Double twist when you hit the air
Look at Julie, down below
The levee doing the do-pas-o

[Chorus]
I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Broken heart don't feel so bad
You ain't got half of what you thought you had
Rock you, baby, to and fro
Not too fast, and not too slow

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Bridge]
That's the way it's been in town
Ever since they tore the jukebox down
Two-bit piece don't buy no more
Not so much as it done before

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
Oh, get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Refrain]
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

[Verse 1]
Round, round robin run around, got to get back to where you belong
Little bit harder, just a little bit more
A little bit further than you gone before

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Small wheel turn by the fire and rod
Big wheel turn by the grace of God
Every time that wheel turn 'round
Bound to cover just a little more ground
Bound to cover just a little more ground

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Outro]
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

[Verse 1]
A man and a woman come together as strangers
When they part they're usually strangers still
It's like a practical joke played on us by our maker
Empty bottles that can't be filled

[Chorus]
Baby, who's to say it should have been different now that it's done
Baby, who's to say that it should have been, anyway
Baby, who's to say that it even matters in the long run
Give it just a minute
And it will blow away, blow away

[Verse 2]
You fancy me to be the master of your feelings
You barely bruise me with your looks to kill
Though I admit we were sometimes brutal in our dealings
I never held you against your will

[Chorus]
Baby, who's to say it should have been different now that it's done
Baby, who's to say that it should have been, anyway
Baby, who's to say that it even matters in the long run
Give it just a minute
And it will blow away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Your case against me is so very clearly stated
I plead no contest, I just turn and I shrug
I've come to figure all importance overestimated
You must mean water when you get on your knees and beg me for blood

[Chorus]
Baby, who's to say it should have been different now that it's done
Baby, who's to say that it should have been, anyway
Baby, who's to say that it even matters in the long run
Give it just a minute
And it will blow away, it'll blow away

[Outro]
Like a feather in a whirlwind (Blow away)
Just as surely, as surely as the world spins (Blow away)
Oh, it'll blow, it'll blow, it'll blow away (Blow away)
Ooh, it'll blow, give it just a minute, give it just a minute
And it'll blow away
Give it just a, give it just a little minute now
And watch it blow, watch it blow away
Let it blow, let it blow away
Watch it blow, watch it blow, watch it blow away
Wait a minute...
Give me just a little piece of your time, baby
Give me just a little second now
All I'm asking for is just a little minute
A minute 'til you listen, listen to, listen, listen to me close
Come on, give me an ear
Are you out there? Can you hear me? Let me know
You want love, you want love
You think you got love right here in your hand
You're holding on tight to
You think you got love, you think you got love right here in your hand
And it's like you wanna put it inside you
It's like you wanna put it deep inside you
It's like you wanna keep love in your heart
And the only way you know you'll know to do is not to let it go
It's like you think you're in a cage, it's a jail cell
It's like you don't think love can get past through ribs
It's like you don't think love can get out
Get away from you as long as you hold it inside
But you're wrong
The only thing you do is keep in that caged cell
Keeping love out, keeping it out, keeping it away
You've gotta open up the door
You've gotta open up the door and let love in
Let it come and go
Do you wanna know love?
Do you wanna know real love?
Real love you don't hold inside
Real love you can let go
And it'll come back, it'll fly right back to you, yes it do
That's real love
So help me out, help me out a minute
Would you help me out?
Sing it after me, I want real love
Said I want real, real love
I want real, real, real love
I want real, real, real love, give me real love
Real love, real, real, real, real love
Okay, we'll be back in just a little bit

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust to nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it’s done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
But I can tell your future
Oh, just look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I’m just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep turning
While I'm playing in the band
And if a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Outro]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Well, the first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry anymore
Because when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door
Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Is are you kind?

[Verse 2]
It's a buck dancer's choice my friend
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice
Will you come with me?
Won't you come with me?
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Will you come with me?

[Bridge]
Goddamn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like
Their walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on me

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Where does the time go?

[Verse 4]
I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Verse 1]
Let my inspiration flow
In token lines suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake me
'Til my tale is told and done

While the firelight’s aglow
Strange shadows from the flames will grow
'Til things we've never seen
Will seem familiar

Shadows of a sailor forming
Winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady
Many years ago

Here beside him stands a man
A soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights
But lost at love
While the storyteller speaks
A door within the fire creaks
Suddenly flies open
And a girl is standing there

Eyes alight with glowing hair
All that fancy paints as fair
She takes her fan and throws it
In the lion’s den

"Which of you to gain me, tell
Will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you
If you will not take the chance"

The sailor gave at least a try
The soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength
And not disaster

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
The sailor coming out again
The lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today
You decide if he was wise
The storyteller makes no choice
Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light
And not to master

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Since the end is never told
We pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will come back
But he cannot be bought or sold

[Terrapin Station]

[Verse]
Inspiration move me brightly
Light the song with sense and color
Hold away despair
More than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast
Statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb
To get to Terrapin

Counting stars by candlelight
All are dim but one is bright:
The spiral light of Venus
Rising first and shining best
Oh, from the northwest corner
Of a brand-new crescent moon
Crickets and cicadas sing
A rare and different tune

[Outro]
Terrapin Station
In the shadow of the moon
Terrapin Station
And I know we'll be there soon
Terrapin - I can’t figure out
Terrapin - If it's the end or beginning
Terrapin - But the train's put it’s brakes on
Terrapin - And the whistle is screaming: Terrapin
Terrapin

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're going to know just how I feel
Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I want to tell you how it's going to be
You're going to give your love to me
I want to love you night and day
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away

[Outro]
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
Not fade away

You know my love will not fade away
Not fade away (Not fade away)
Not fade away (Not fade away)
You know my love will not fade away
Not fade away (Not fade away)
Not fade away (Not fade away)
You know my love will not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
(Audience repeats)

[Verse 1]
Lay down my dear brothers, lay down and take your rest
Oh, won't you lay your head upon your savior’s breast
I love you, oh but Jesus loves you the best
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

[Verse 2]
Lay down my dear brothers, lay down and take your rest
Oh, won't you lay your head upon your savior's breast
I love you, oh but Jesus loves you the best
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Tell "A" for the ark, that wonderful boat
(And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight)
I said "B" for the beast at the ending of the wood
(Bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight)
Will it eat all the children? That would not be good good
(We bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight)
I remember right well, I remember right well
(We bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight)
Oh, walking in Jerusalem just like John
(We bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight)
Israelites stop short, come for me tonight
(We bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight)
Goodnight

[Outro]
Lay down my dear brothers, lay down and take your rest
Oh, won’t you lay your head upon your savior's breast
I love you, oh but Jesus loves you the best
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

[Verse 1]
Little girl lost
In a forest of dreams
It's a dark old wood
And it's damp with dew
Hoot owl hoots
For a moment it seems
Something big and cold
Has got a hold of you
Just when everything gets scary
Daddy's come around for his darling again
Hold my hand with your little fingers
Daddy's loving arms are going to gather you in

[Chorus]
Ain't no way the Boogeyman can get you
You can close your eyes, the world is going to let you
Your daddy's here and he never will forget you
I will take you home
I will take you home
Gonna carry you back home in my arms
I will take you home

[Verse 2]
Long is the road
We travel on down
Short are the legs
That will struggle behind
I wish I knew for sure
Just where we were bound
What we will be doing
And what we're going to find
Wherever we go, there will be birds to cheer you
Flowers to color in the fields around
Wherever we go, I'll be right here near you
You can't get lost when you're always found

[Chorus]
Ain't no fog that's thick enough to hide you
Your daddy's going to be right here beside you
If your fears should start to get inside you
I will take you home
I will take you home
Going to carry you back home in my arms
I will take you home

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Verse 2]
Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine, yes it does
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, yes I am
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Going where the climate suits my clothes
Well, I'm going where the climate suits my clothes
Going where the climate suits my clothes
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, yes I am
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Well, I'm goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Verse 1]
All of my friends come to see me last night
I was laying in my bed and dying
Annie Beauneau from Saint Angel
Say "The weather down here so fine"

[Verse 2]
Just then the wind
Came squalling through the door
But who can
The weather command?
Just want to have
A little peace to die
And a friend or two
I love at hand

[Verse 3]
Fever rolled up to a hundred-and-five
Roll on up
Gonna roll back down
One more day
I find myself alive
Tomorrow
Maybe go
Beneath the ground

[Bridge]
See here how everything
Lead up to this day
And it's just like
Any other day
That’s ever been
Sun going up and then
The sun it going down
Shine through my window and
My friends they come around
Come around
Come around

[Outro]
The people might know
But the people don't care
That a man could be
As poor as me
"Take a look at poor Peter
He's lying in pain
Now let’s go
Run and see"
Run and see
Oh, run and see
Run, run, run, run, run and see

[Chorus]
Well, the joint was jumping, going around and around
Hey, now reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
No, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Verse 1]
Well, it sounded so sweet, I had to take a chance
Rose out of my seat, 'cause I had to dance
I started moving my feet now, oh yes and clapping my hands

[Chorus]
No, they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Hey, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
No, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well, at twelve o'clock now, the whole place, it was packed now
The front doors was locked now, the whole place, it was packed now
But when the police knocked now, them old doors they flew back

[Chorus]
No, they never stopped rocking, moving around and around and around
Hey now, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy crazy crazy sound
No, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Well, it sounded so sweet, I had to take, take, take...
Rose out of my seat, I had to dance
Started moving my feet, oh yes and clapping my hands

[Chorus]
No, they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Hey, what a crazy sound
No, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
It went down, it went...

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Ooh, no, they never stopped rocking, going around and around and around and around
Reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
No, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Verse 1]
Fare you well, my honey
Fare you well, my only true one
All the birds that were singing
Have flown except you alone

I'm gonna leave this brokedown palace
On my hands and my knees, I will roll, roll, roll
Make myself a bed by the waterside
In my time - in my time - I will roll, roll roll

[Chorus]
In a bed, in a bed
By the waterside I will lay my head
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Verse 2]
River gonna take me
Sing me sweet and sleepy
Sing me sweet and sleepy
All the way back home
It's a far-gone lullaby
Sung many years ago
Mama, Mama, many worlds I've come
Since I first left home

[Chorus]
Going home, going home, by the riverside I will rest my bones
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul

[Verse 3]
I'm going to plant a weeping willow
By the bank's green edge it will grow, grow, grow
Sing a lullaby beside the water
Lovers come and go - the river roll, roll, roll

[Chorus]
Fare you well, fare you well, I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Fare you well, fare you well, I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul
I wanna listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul

[Spoken Intro: Bill Graham & Dan Aykroyd]
Now, ladies and gentlemen, yes
A momentous occasion, as we cruise into the 1980s
Here at Winterland in San Francisco, 1978, going on 1981

What you see before you is a ten, no wait, 12, 12 foot long burning ember of marijuana
Yes, let us begin the countdown
Five, four, three, two, two and a half, two minus one quarter, one
Happy New Year, ladies and gentlemen! Happy New Year!

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Refrain]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you now

She can dance a Cajun rhythm
And jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive
She's a summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive, y'all

Sugar magnolia ringing that bluebell
Caught up in sunlight
Come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Come on, honey, come along with me

[Refrain]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunlight? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out, and I wander around, I walk around now

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
As I was walkin' 'round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air
From the other direction, she was calling my eye
It could be an illusion, but I might as well try, might as well try

[Verse 2]
She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
I knew without askin' she was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls
I knew right away she was not like other girls, other girls

[Verse 3]
In the heat of the evening when the dealing got rough
Was too pat to open and too cool to bluff
I picked up my matches, was closing the door
Had one of those flashes I'd been there before, been there before

[Bridge]
Well, I ain't often right but I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way it does in this song
Once in a while you can get shown the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right

[Verse 4]
There ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
Scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues
There's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eyes
I had to learn the hard way, to let her pass by, let her pass by

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
Wind in the willow's playin' "Tea for Two"
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing in the heart of gold band, heart of gold band

[Instrumental break with background harmonizing]

[Verse 1]
We took a vow in summertime
Now we find ourselves in late December
I believe that New Year's Eve
Will be the perfect time for their great surrender
But they don't remember

[Pre-Chorus]
Anger wants a voice, voices wanna sing
Singers harmonize 'til they can't hear anything
I thought that I was free from all that questionin'
But every time a problem ends, another one begins

[Chorus]
And the stone walls of Harmony Hall bear witness
Anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight
Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

[Verse 2]
Within the halls of power lies a nervous heart that beats
Like a Young Pretender's
Beneath these velvet gloves I hide
The shameful, crooked hands of a moneylender
'Cause I still remember

[Pre-Chorus]
Anger wants a voice, voices wanna sing
Singers harmonize 'til they can't hear anything
I thought that I was free from all that questionin'
But every time a problem ends, another one begins

[Chorus]
And the stone walls of Harmony Hall bear witness
Anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight
Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
And the stone walls of Harmony Hall bear witness
Anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight
Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

[Chorus]
And the stone walls of Harmony Hall bear witness
Anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight
Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

Before I get locked up, I know she know where the cash at (bring the bail money)
She a red bottom killer, her ass fat
If I light one up and she gettin' fucked up, she like "pass that" (stop schemin')
If she ride shotty and it come down to it, she'll blast that (BOOM!)
And Lord knows that my niggas is home, but she past that
And forgive me though, 'cause I think that I'm having a flashback
Down in Miami I ran in the mansions, you backed out the driveway and crashed that (she stole it)
Well we livin' that life, no hashtag
Shopping sprees, 4 or 5k, ballin' hard for your bag tags (Chanel shit)
I got good dick for your bad ass
Can't slow down this fast cash, so we take trips and don't pack bags

[Hook: Young Thug]
I'm gon' beat that pussy up just like a champion (Woo!)
I'm a beast inside these streets like a barbarian (Beast!)
Told my baby next February we're married (On blood!)
We laughin' at these pussy boys, they're so hilarious (Hah!)
I might get him knocked off, pull some spaghetti strings
They ain't gon' play with me, no no (pew pew pew pew)
I might get him knocked off for a double sealed pint of lean
They ain't gon' play with me, no no (on blood)
I might get him knocked off while I pull a bank scheme
They ain't gon' play with me, no no (skrrrrrt)
I might get him knocked off for just tryna join the team
They ain't gon' play with me, no no (gah gah gah gah)
Yeah!

Baby-baby, hello, make it wiggle like, yeah (Ayy, ayy)

I like 'em yellow, thick, black, and ghetto
Villain is willy nilly!
(Live in stereo)Want you to call me at that address, if I'm still there, then I'll make sure you get the crackDoom has taken over every continent! Meanwhile, back in space, Doom continues to search for colleaguesAnd your name?
Khan is my name. Khan, nothing else. KhanAs the funky beat continues, a rock steadyWe have got to try to find Doom!
Good luck!Time to get the feta!

[Verse 1]
Villain, man, never ran with krills in his hand and
Won't stop rockin' til he clocked in a gazillion grand
Tillin' the wasteland sands
Raps on backs of treasure maps, stacks to the ceilin' fan
He rest when he's ashes
Ask 'em after ten miles in his ga-lashes, smashes stashes
Chip on his shoulder with a slip on holster
A clip, a folder and his grip on a boulder bolster
They supposed ta know, it show when his aura glow
Get from out the row, when he get dough it's horrible
Time is money, spend, waste, save, invest the fess
The ten case of cave a chicken chest S
Yes ya'll the dub will get ya trickles
The best ballers pitch in and rub to get a nickels
But tut tut, he about to change the price again
It go up each time he blow up like hydrogen
Villain here, have em shrillin' in fear
And won't stop top illin' til he a gazillionaire
Grillin' stare, yeah ya boy had drama
Got 'em on a mental plane, avoided bad karma
Once sold an inbred skinhead a nigga joke
Plus a brand new chrome smoker with the triggers broke
I thought I told 'em, "Firing pins was separate"
He find out later when he tries to go and rep it
Took a Jehovah money for a Arabic Torah
Charged an advance to translate it and ignored it, sorta
One monkey don't stop no slaughter
A junkie want ta cop a quarter ton, run for the border
Know the drill, it ain't worth the overkill
Flow skill, still there's no thrill
Villa bill ya ten K bills in his pilla
Villa, when it gets realer, split the skrilla with—

[Verse 2]
—Dilla, (Dilla) mix, mix, mix
Do a deal for kicks and get rich quick
Sketch lyric, bet 'cha bottom nick on some vic
Ick from the drumstick, come with the dumb shtick
Sick slick, hidden in a book
The only way they find it if you're spittin' in a hook
Listen, don't look now, keep walkin'
Traded three beans for this cow, cheap talkin'
Hawk men stalkin' hear that we hawkin' often
Coughin' to a coffin, might as well scoff the pork then
He's like Worf, some say stronger though
Off the top Jay Strongbow, play along bro
Wear a mask like yo off the Gong Show
Flow slow as Mongo, Don Juan thong pro
For ya info when he's not practicin' Jim Crow
Or actressin' and some nympho bimbo
He's playin' Ray J the old tape
DOOM—well what can I say like JJ in a gold cape
Fill it to the rim like brim
Villain and ya won't find him in no gym
Probably a foggy bog with the frogs
With a dot on the guard as he squat on a log
Half cocked and half baked
Used to keep a full stock of work, half rocked and half shake
My mistake, sign a track agreement
For more G's than lines and cracks in the cement
In any event it's fake like wrestlin'
Get 'em like Jake The Snake on mescalines
Ahem, elixir for the dry throat
Tried to hit the high note, Villain since a itsy bitsy zygote
By remote, send in the meat wagon
Braggin' MC's packed in with they feets draggin'
These stats are staggerin'
Had his PhD in indiscreet street hagglin'
Villain, his agenda is clear
Endin' this year with dividends to spare, here
It's not meant for the seein'
Went through the ceilin' after enterin' his center bein'
A new meanin' to sales through the roof
Guaranteed raw and saw his truth was truth, proof
It's the return of the tramp
Who do a duet jam when Ernest Goes To Camp
For the right earn - na'mean like Vern
We need some more oil for the machines to burn, learn
Jiminy crickets
He gets lucky like winnin' free tickets off SimplyLyrics
One man's waste is another man's soap
Sons fan base know the brotha man's dope
A real weirdo with a bugged rare flow
And the way his hair grow was ugly as a scarecrow
He wears a mask so the charge won't grab
On a rooftop with a large stone slab
Heads up, talk white and thought niggerish
Refuse to walk tight and got his off the vigorish
Black licorice and equally as yucky
How he handled the money was strictly Dan Stuckie
Monkey hustle, man on fire
Later for the date than the Hadron Collider
And cost more, it be seemin' like a style
DOOM leave the competition steamin' like a pile
Smile, ding! Sparklin' jewels
In effect like alternate side of the street parkin' rules
Fools, the roach was never dead
Live for a week, then dehydrate with a severed head
Instead it was depicted as flicked in
Split, the wicks lit
Bret: We're very lucky
To be touring, uh

Your country
With, uh, special guests

We'd like to welcome to the stage

Please give a London warm
Welcome to the one and only

New Zealand Symphony Orchestra

This is Nigel
He's the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra

I know you're thinking, "Well
This is a very small orchestra,"

Because we've seen
The kind of orchestras
That you guys are
Always harping on about

No, that actually
Wasn't intended, that pun

No, but it was a good one

Next time I say it, I'll intend it

But that was without intention

But, um, he is a small
Orchestra, but per capita

He's actually bigger
Than your orchestra

We're gonna play
One of our older songs

This one is set in the 14th century

It's very popular, this song in
England, but only in England
Because it has a recorder in it

You love a bit of recorder

Jemaine:
You love some weird things

Could we get some
Lighting that evokes

A medieval atmosphere, please?

Thank you
So, as well as our doing
A collection of songs tonight

We're gonna tell you some of our--
Our rock and roll anecdotes

Give you a sort of a
Behind-the-scenes look

At, uh, you know
The life of the band

Jemaine: You know, some pretty
Funny experiences that we've had

-some pretty crazy ones as well
-Yeah

And I think one that encompasses
Both those, um, subsets...
I don't know
I don't think "subsets"

Is a very rock and roll
Way of describing it

Jemaine: That's what
We're talking about, the fun...

The fun rock and roll subset

Um...
Uh, the story--

The story that Jemaine
Is talking about

-I think, is the muffin story
-Oh, yes!

Yeah. Um, this is
A story of, um...

The time when I got
To my hotel room--
Oh, no, sorry. Let me give
A bit of context

Wait. Hold on
Everyone listen to Bret

Okay

Okay, so
First of all, being in a band

We stay in hotels
'cause we tour around

-We stay in some quite fancy hotels
-Oh, yes

We've stayed in some Premiere Inns

Yeah, absolutely

And we've stayed in some of the
Very Best Westerns out there

And I got to my room
And there was a complimentary
Muffin sitting on the table

Okay, this is where the fun--

You guys obviously don't stay in these
Fancy hotels

-'cause this is very unusual
-Some of you are a few steps ahead

You're like, okay, this is
Where the fun's beginning

-Yeah
-Yep

So, I thought, okay, if I've
Got a complimentary muffin

I bet old Mad Dog's got
A complimentary muffin

That's my nickname
I'll tell you about that later

But tell them the joke about
The complimentary muffin

Okay, yeah, sure. Okay, so
The complimentary muffin, now

It's not a muffin that says, "Oh
Hello, Bret, you look good today."

It's a complimentary muffin

-But...
-Yeah

Imagine that though
Imagine that

-That's ridiculous
-It's such a fun...

A very flattering pastry

Little blueberry eyes

You know, just looking up at you
Going...

-Absolutely adorable
-I'd eat that

It's just looking up at you, going

"Well, you've got a nice personality
Little muffin

That's just a little
Digression we add in to--

Yeah, we just, like, spice up
The story with a bit of humor

Yeah. Um...

It wasn't something that
Occurred to us at the time

And so, I thought if I've got
A complimentary muffin

I bet Mad Dog here's got one, and...

Right. You're probably wondering
Why I get called "Mad Dog."

Bret: This is a
Nickname that caught on

When Jemaine e-mailed me with
The subject "New Nickname."

I'm not sure if
That's the start of it

I'm sure it was a series of events

No, well, it was
A series of e-mails

It was-- Yeah. Three or
Four e-mails reminding me

And then, eventually, it caught
On, and now, I've got it up here

It's not important to the story
About how I got the name

I've got a reputation, and they
Call me Mad Dog, within the band

And so, I thought--

I called his room, and I'd
Only been in the room

Maybe like, two or three minutes
You know, me and my muffin

And I call up Jemaine's room
I mean, Mad Dog, and, um...

-Thank you
-He answers the phone

"Hello?"

He's already bloody halfway
Through that muffin

Yeah

Bloody Keith Richards over here

God

I didn't-- I didn't even wait
As soon as I saw it, rawr!

What'd you do?
Just walk in there like

"Rawr, give me that
I'll do that!" Bloody...

Yeah, basically
That's pretty much it

He wasn't even there
And he guessed it

-because I'm a mad dog
-And...

You start to get a picture of the
Life of excess that we live

Jemaine: For you to know
It's a life of excess

You need to also know that
We had muffins for breakfast

That's right, yeah

So that's bloody two muffins
In one day. Oh!

-Double muffiner
-Oh, God

-Yeah
-Yeah

And so, we collect these
Stories as we travel 'round

You never know when something
Crazy's gonna happen

Yeah!
That one was about seven years ago

It was
Thank you
Thanks, London

Now you see the lights have come
Up a bit, you see it is us

And you probably noticed
That we're a bit older

Than, uh...
Than we were formally

We're not ill

We've been trying to stay young

We're trying to preserve ourselves
Like those sexy man-boys

That you saw
Ten years ago on the TV
Um... -'Cause we know that
People don't like characters

That they know
From television to get older

I think, to them, it's disturbing

I mean, it's difficult for us to see
You 'cause you're older as well

But the lights are quite dark, so
It's quite flattering on you guys

Yeah, but us being up here
And we remind you of your own

I guess, your own mortality

Sorry about that

Having said that, let's enjoy...

The fleeting moment. Yes!
The time we have left
Let's try and have a good time
Yeah

Anyway, you see how fast it's going

Yeah, it's gone. It's great
To be here in London

This is a bit of
A reunion gig for us

Uh, we haven't played
Since last night, and...

It's just great to have
The whole band here

Um... -We don't know if
You've heard these jokes

You might be exactly
The same people

We're one of the biggest
Bands in New Zealand now
Uh...
In terms of the number of members

Yeah
Yeah

We're a two-person band

Most bands in New Zealand
Are one-person bands

Um, you've probably heard of John

Jemaine: Rob
Bret: Lucy

Lucy's great
Yeah, yeah, brilliant

It's a very good band

Even our national orchestra's
A one-man band. It's very...

When we combined, we formed
The super group

Bret used to be
In a band, didn't you?

My old band was called "The Bret."

And...
Yeah

And Jemaine was-- Your band was
Called, what, The Jemaine and...?

No, it was "Jemaine and the No
One Else."

That's right, yeah

How we got together was
We were billed on the same night

At the same time by accident

And most of our songs have
The same chords anyway

So we just sang at the same time, and
That's how we wrote a lot of our songs

Yeah, and that's how
This electricity got started

Bret: Yeah, yeah
That's right

We're gonna do some songs
This next one is, uh...

It's another du-et

Um, and...

It... it's kind of
Groundbreaking for us

Um, because we're really challenging

The gender stereotypes that exist
Uh, within the band. And...

And for those of you
Who know some of our songs

I often play the ladies
In our songs

And...
And you do it well, Bret

You do it well
Thank you

Uh, but this next song, we're doing
A gender reversal reversal

So, what we usually do is we gender
Reverse it, so Bret's the lady

But we've reversed it
Back on itself

Full 360 till he's back to a man

Yeah

Yeah, he's very excited
To be playing the very macho

Ian. A guy called Ian

A British
A very, um...

It's a very macho name

He's a very macho, sexual British guy
Mm

And Jemaine takes
The role of Deanna

Yeah
Uh, it's an office place romance

And she's a very complex character

A lot of layers that
You've put in there

Yeah, I've put in two layers

I've added another dimension
To what I usually do

To make a fully
Two-dimensional character

Yeah
Uh, I've really embraced the role

I've studied a woman
That's right

And I just watched
Little things she did

It's like this kind of thing

You'll see that come
You'll see it

I won't do it now
Save it, save it

I'll save it for the performance

When you see me become Deanna

You'll see it
Oh, it's a transformation

Yeah
Thank you!

Thank you
But one last detail

Um, before we do play
The song, it's just

You know, I think we want to
Point out that we are aware

That comedy is a very
Male-dominated industry

Unfortunately
You know, we're writing the roles

For women, but, um...

The problem is the band
Itself is very male-dominated

And...
It's systemic

Yeah, it's
It's systemic, a systemic problem

It's the fucking patriarchy
That's what it is

Yeah, so we're sorry about that

But we're trying
We're trying, yeah, yeah

What? Too fast?

What do you think?
Probably too rocking for us

Tone it down a little bit
People are moshing at the front
Inner-city life, inner-city pressure

The concrete world
Is starting to get ya

The city is alive
The city is expanding

Living in the city can be demanding

You pawned everything
Everything you own

Your toothbrush jar
And a camera phone

You don't know where you’re
Going, you cross the street

You don't know why you did, you
Walk back across the street
Now you're standing in the
Sitting room totally skint

Your favorite jersey
Is covered in lint

You want to sit down
But you sold your chair

So you just stand there

You just stand there

You just stand there

Both:
Inner

Inner-city

Inner-city pressure

Inner-city pressure

Counting coins on
The counter of the 7/11
From a quarter past six
Till a quarter to seven

The manager, Bevin
Starts to abuse me

Hey man, I just want some muesli

Neon signs, hidden messages

Questions, answers, and fetishes

You know you’re not in high finance

Considering secondhand underpants

Check your mind
How did it get so bad?

What happened to those
Other underpants you had?

Check your pockets
Haven't found one cent yet

Landlord's on your balls
"Have you paid your rent yet?"
Both:
Inner

Inner-city

Inner-city pressure

Inner-city pressure

Inner

Both: Inner-city

Inner-city pressure

Inner-city pressure

Can you handle the pressure?

So you think maybe
I'll be a prostitute

Just to pay for your lessons
You're learning the flute

Ladies won't pay you
Very much for this

Looks like you'll never be
A concert flautist

You don't measure up
To the expectation

When you’re unemployed
There’s no vacation

No one cares, no one sympathizes

You just stay home
And play synthesizers

You've lost perspective
Like a picture by Escher

It’s the pressure

Inner-city pressure

New York

Berlin

Paris

Wellington

Pressure, pressure, pressure
Sorry. I was just laughing

I was just remembering
The muffin story

Not all our stories
Are muffin stories

Most of them, but not all of them

I know what you're thinking
You're thinking these guys

They just bloody travel
Around the country

Eating muffins
Living the life, and um...

But we've had darker times
And we want to share
One of those with you tonight

We were on our way to a gig, and we
Found ourselves trapped in a lift

Yeah. It's not a long story
But, um...

It's claustrophobic in there

And we-- we panicked to be honest

It was very intense for the band
Yeah, for sure

We're not too proud to say that
Uh, we freaked out

Shit got very real. Uh...

And by that, he means
That one of the band did a shit

In the, um...
In the elevator
It was-- it was not
Comfortable at that point

And it was very early in
Very early in

Yeah
And, um...

Well, we were in there
For a few hours

And we eventually discovered
The emergency button

That contacts a... I don't know
Who that person is exactly

We didn't know because we were
So freaked out and panicked

We didn't even ask her
About herself

Usually, I'd say, "Hi, I'm Jemaine
Who are you?
"And, you know, what you up to?

What are your interests?"
But we were freaking out

We were like, "We're trapped in
The lift. There's a poo in here."

And she said, "Don't worry
Calm down. Take a deep breath."

-We said, "That's not great 'cause...
-No, no. We're not gonna

-But, um...
-That's not gonna help the situation

No, she said, "Where you trying
To get to?" And we explained

And she said, "Okay, well, try
Pressing the number, the button three

That corresponds to the floor
You're trying to get to."

And so we did that, and, uh, in
Hindsight, it was obvious, you know

But at the time, uh, you know

I thought Jemaine
Had pressed the button

-Jemaine thought I pressed it
-I thought Bret had pressed it

'Cause I pressed it the
Previous time, so I thought

"Oh, well, Bret probably took a note
Of that. He'll do it next time."

It was more of
A communication breakdown

Than an actual elevator breakdown

But sometimes they can lead to
The most traumatic experiences

And that's the case in this particular
Story, which we hope you learn from

-It's a cautionary tale
-Mm

Okay

-Okay, another song then
-Yeah, we'll do another song

Nigel, the Symphony Orchestra

Is switching to bass guitar

And Bret, he's got
The glockenspiels, some bongos

There's a pineapple

That's a real pineapple
So that's talent

That shows you musicianship there

It's a real gift

Let's, uh, have the beat

[Hook 1: Bret & (Jemaine)]
Too many mutha'uckas
'Uckin' with my shi'
There's too many mutha'uckas
'Uckin' with my shi' ('uckin' with my shi')
Too many mutha'uckas
'Uckin' with my shi'
How many mutha'uckas?
Too many to count, mutha'uckas

[Verse 1: Jemaine (Bret)]
I pay my mutha'uckin' rent fortnightly
Mutha'uckas at the bank trying to play me
An amount from my account goes out on A/P (on A/P!)
Yeah, you know me
Those utha'uckas charge a two buck transaction fee
Makes my payment short, my rent comes back to me
Minus a twenty-five dollar penalty
So you fee'd me cause of your mutha'uckin' fee?
Read the word on my ATM slip
Said, "We're all mutha'uckas
And we're 'uckin' with your shi'," so come on!

[Verse 2: Bret]
The mutha'ucka runs a racist 'uckin' grocery
The mutha'ucka won't sell an apple to a Kiwi
The shi' fight's gonna get vicious and malicious
Cut the cra' ...'muthu'...' I need my Red Delicious
Tells me as a 'uckin' Kiwi that my money isn't valid
Gonna dice the ... like a m... fruit salad
Gonna... j... MANGO
Ugh, hgh, gh, PAPAYA
Ugh, gonna, ... in a fruit... avocado

[scatting] Tomato

[more choppy scatting]
I'll pop an apple in his ass, yeah!

[Hook: (Bret) & Jemaine]
Too many mutha'uckas
'Uckin' with my shi'
(He's gonna wake up in a smoothie)
Too many mutha'uckas
'Uckin' with my shi'
(Stone-cold press, mutha'ucka!)
Too many mutha'uckas
'Uckin' with my shi'
How many mutha'uckas?
Too many to count, mutha'ukas

[Hook 2: Bret & (Jemaine)]
I've got hurt feelings, I've got hurt feelings
(A lot of people think that
Rappers don't have feelings)
(But the Hiphopopotamus
And the Rhymenoceros
Have feelings)
I've got hurt feelings
(It hurts our feelings when you
Suggest that we don't have feelings)

[Verse 3: Jemaine]
I make a meal for my friends
Try to make it delicious
Tryin' to keep it nutritious
Creatin' wonderful dishes
But not one of those muthafudges
Thinks about how I feel
Because not one mutha'ucka
Compliments my meal

[Hook 3: Both (Jemaine)]
And I've got hurt feelings
Yes, I've got hurt feelings
(I spent a long time
On that casserole, ass-a-hole)
I've got hurt feelings
I got hurt feelings
(Why don't you take
These profiteroles
And put them up
Your shi'-ta-holes, hey)

[Verse 4: Bret]
Here's a little story
Bring a tear to your eye
I was shopping for a
Wet suit to SCUBA dive
But every suit I tried
Was too big around my thighs
The assistant suggested
I try a lady's size, well

[Hook 4: Both (Bret)]
I got hurt feelings
(I'm not gonna wear
A lady's wet suit!
No! I am a man!)
Yeah, I've got hurt feelings
I got hurt feelings
(Why don't you get me
A small man's wet suit, bitch?)

[Verse 5: Jemaine]
Talkin' 'bout my birthday
The year 2003
And I'm waiting for a
Phone call from my family

[instrumental break, cheering and hollering from the crowd]

It's 12:23
They forgot about me

[Hook 5: Both (Jemaine)]
(And I've got hurt feelings
I've got hurt feelings
The day after my birthday's
Not my birthday, Mum
Thanks for the message!)
I've got hurt feelings
I've got hurt feelings
(It's your birthday
We're gonna party like your
Mum forgot your birthday)

[Verse 6: Bret]
Well, I called my friends
Said let's go into town
But they're all too busy
To go into town
So I go by myself
I go into town
Then I see all my friends
Yeah, they're all in town
Yeah, they all drive
Past in Simon's car
So I follow them
Down to the cinema
Yeah, well, seein' them without me
It breaks my heart
When they go to watch that movie
Dirty Grandpa
'Cause they know I love
The work of Robert DeNiro
They know Zac Efron
Is a personal hero
They know I suffer from chronic FOMO
Told them 'bout the movie
I sent them promo

[Interlude]
Nigel:
I've got hurt feelings
I've got hurt feelings

[cheers and applause from the audience]

Jemaine (spoken):
Nigel

Nigel, you're supposed
To just do the...

But...

That was really good

Bret (spoken)
That was good, yeah

Jemaine (spoken)
That was really good, man

[Bridge: Bret & (Jemaine)]
Have you been told
That your ass is too big?
(Have you ever been asked
If your hair is a wig?)
Have you ever been told
You're mediocre in bed?
(Have you ever been described
As having a weird-shaped head?)
Have your friends ever
Forgotten you and driven away?
(Yes, they have
They forgot about J)
Were you ever called "homo"
'cause at school you took drama?
(Have you ever been told
That you look like a llama?)

[Outro: Bret & (Jemaine)]
Tears of a rapper
(These are the tears of
A rapper falling down you)
I'm crying tears of a rapper
(These are the tears
Of a rapper falling down on you)
These are diamond tears of a rapper
(These are the tears of a rapper)
Golden tears of a rapper
Titanium tears of a rapper
(These are the tears of a rapper
Falling down on you mutha'uckas)
It's come, uh, almost to the time

Where we do our last song

I guess we don't have
To do another song

If you really...

Have that reaction

"Well, I know your brain size,"
It sounds like you said

-I can't-- we can't understand you
-We can't-- yeah

If you just write down your heckles
And then give them to Security

And they'll bring them 'round
The back and we'll just...
Rock and roll?

Tell them the muffin story
Again, Bret

I can think of one more
Anecdote for those of you

Who are demanding more
Rock and roll anecdotes

Um...
We had this one night after a show

Where we had a fan
Made their way backstage

Kind of-- When you're in
A band, you have fans

-and groupies, sort of groupies
-I don't think we should tell--

I don't think
We should tell this story
Do you mean the one where
She came backstage and she...

That was my reaction when he said...

We can't tell that story. It's a very
Disturbing story, because the...

I know, but she asked us to do that

It was not our idea

Well, that-- in a way, that's
What makes it difficult for me

Because I wasn't
Comfortable with it

I just did it because she'd bought
A couple of tote bags, and...

I-- I really regret...

Yeah, well, but I just--
I think we come off
Fine in the story
It's not us

You enjoyed parts of it, and I
Even had a good time at one point

But...

When a-- you know

It got to the part where...

I found myself...

It's not a proud moment and I don't
Want to share

Yeah, you're right. Just because she was
A big fan doesn't mean that we should...

Don't

Yeah

No, yeah, don't tell that one

We'll do another song

Um, well, this is our last song

It's, um...
When we say it's our last song

We actually mean
It's the song before we go off

And then we come back on again
And do some more songs

This is our last song

-Make sure Nigel knows
-Nigel, it's not our last song

-We'll do-- we'll come back
-It's a kind of a rock and roll thing

Bands do it, but orchestras
Don't really know

Orchestras don't do it. They just stand
There for about five to ten minutes

This song is about being
On the road, touring, um

And we get to know you
And then tomorrow night

We-- you know, we hit the road
And we're back here actually, but...

You don't decide when
You go back on the road

The road decides
When you get back onto it

Bret:
Yeah

We spend the night with you and we get
This wonderful relationship with you

You've been a great audience tonight
But then, you know, the next gig

Uh, you know
This connection that we have is, uh

We just forget it completely

We'll never forget

-Bret: Well, we will, but--
-We will forget, yeah

But for a limited time

We will never forget you guys

Row B, we'll remember you guys

-Yeah
-Yeah

Jemaine:
Row V up there

-Yeah
-Yeah

Love you guys

U, yep, yep

But we can't--

I mean, there's so many
Letters, aren't there?

-We can't do--
-We're gonna miss you A through Z

-Bret: Right
-All of you guys

Yeah, yeah

Shush, you guys
We're gonna go--

-Shush
-Shush, you guys!

You're gonna see the mad side
Of Mad Dog if you...

We've got a curfew
We can't just keep talking to you

If you talk to us
We're from New Zealand

If someone talks to us
We talk back

We're not Londoners
We don't ignore you

What we're saying is...

Okay, let's go back

Let's pretend we're not
So annoyed by the audience

'cause it'll look bad on camera

We've got a special
Relationship with you

Oh, we've had-- we've had such a
Wonderful night with you guys, London

Um, that sounded patronizing
Can't use that either

But you know, the next time

We play to another audience

They'll be our main audience

And you'll be a
Long-forgotten memory

And that's sad to us, 'cause--

'cause you are special
Thank you, London

Thanks, London!

Thanks to Nigel, the New
Zealand Symphony Orchestra

Thanks to you guys for coming

Wow, we were just completely
Whelmed back there

-Yeah
-Man, man

What a great show

In the special, we'll edit it
Together to seem a lot smoother

Yeah
I'd like to dedicate
This one to the, uh

The late, great David Bowie

Both:
Bowie's in space

Bowie's in spa-a-hace

Whatcha' doin' out there, man?

That's pretty freaky, Bowie

I hear that space is a pretty

Both:
Freaky place

Is it cold out in space, man?
Do you want my jumper, Bowie?

Does the cold of space

Make your nipples
Go all pointy, Bowie?

And do you use your pointy

Telescopic nipples

As antennae transmitting data

-Back
To Earth, back to Earth?

Both:
Data back to Earth

I bet you do, you freaky
Old bastard, you

Do you have one really funky
Sequin space suit, man?

Or do you have several
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-changes?
Do they smoke grass
Up in space, man?

Or do they smoke astroturf?
Oh, yeah

Oh I'm freaking out on plastic grass

It's such an artificial high

This is Bowie to Bowie

Do you hear me out there, man?

This is Bowie back to Bowie

I read you loud and clear, man

Both:
Oh, yeah, man!

Your signal's so weak
On my radar screen

How far out are you, man?
Well, I'm pretty far out

Both:
That's pretty far out, man

Oh, I am

I'm orbiting Pluto

Both:
Oh, I am

I'm drawn in by it's Groovitational

Both:
It's groovitational pull

And I'm jamming out with
The Mick Jagger-nauts

-Yeah
-Both: And I think it's pretty cool

Man

Are you okay, Bowie?

What was that sound?

I don't know, man

I have to turn my ship around

Oh, it's the craziest scene

Yeah, I'm picking it up

On my LSD screen

Can you hear the
Stratosphere ringing?

Both:
To the choir of

Afro-nauts singing

Bowie's in space

Set your phasers on funky

Both:
Bowie's in space

Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew-pew!

Eenie, ma-ma-meenie mynie mowie

Ba-ba David Bowie's in

[Intro: Bret]
Uh, can we get some lighting that evoke a kind of, uh, "unrequited love" sentiment, please? That's great

[Spoken: Bret]
Uh, g'day. My name's Tony. On behalf of myself and the coachline, I'd like to thank you for choosing to drive with us today. Uh, if you've got any questions, don't hesitate just to sing out.

If you look out to the right there, you'll see the bronze of Bluey, a local sheepdog who became a member of Regional Council. S'a bloody great day for dogs!

Uh, to your left there, you'll see a—you'll see the local town wanker, John Thompson. "G'day, John!" Bloody wanker, hahaha. Nah, he's all right.

[Sung: Bret & Bret & Jemaine]
The town hall
And note the mosaic wall
Well, there are about 5,600 tiles on that wall
I know; I counted them all
A local school
A local swimming pool
That was opened by the governor general
Back in 1952
Where I was caught with a friend, aged 11
Sniffin' tractor fuel
We thought we were pretty cool
Breaking them changing shed rules
But do you see up there
The banner hanging in the air?
That's the Presbyterian Fair
But I never go—there's too many Presbyterians there
But if you're interested
The fair's in the third weekend of August every year
But don't bother entering the raffle
It's always won by some kid of the mayor

[Sung: Bret, Jemaine & Nigel Collins, & All]
Well, look to your left (Look to your left)
What a beautiful sight (Beautiful sight)
It's Paula, Paula Thompson (Paula Thompson)
Née Paula Wright
Look at her hair (Look at her hair)
Ooh, it's still gorgeous, even now (Still gorgeous even now)
It's flowing like the Womahonga River (Womahonga)
Which, incidentally, is to your right
And it's the largest, in the area
In terms of volume
Everybody, look at Paula
Look at Paula Thompson
I always thought I'd marry Paula
But some things just don't work out that way
Well, that's the most important thing
You'll learn on the tour today
Well, that, and the fact there'll be a toilet break
At the Information Center near the man-made lake
Come on!

[Instrumental Break]

[Spoken: Bret]
I'd just ask you one favor: If you do see Paula in town later on, I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention the details of my tour. Same goes for my wife, Gloria. Ah, you'll recognize her 'cause she looks a hell of a lot like Paula. She often gets mistaken for Paula But, uh, well... She's not Paula, that's for sure.

[Sung: Bret, Bret & Jemaine, & All]
One, two, three, four!
Paula Thompson born in '54
To a family of four
To the family next door
Take me back next door
Paula Thompson, née Paula Wright
That's her old house, number 39
Number 41 was mine
If this old coach could go back in time
I'd travel to 1979
Take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take, take, take, take, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take, take, take, take, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Come on, take me back, oh, take me back
Please take me back, take me back!

[Spoken: Bret]
Sorry about that. Got a little carried away there. Uh, it's a very emotional intersection for me. Took a wrong turn there... about 29 years ago. But, uh, that's the end of the tour, so... Yeah, enjoy your stay. Mind your step, and, uh... Good on ya.
Gonna tune for this one?

This one's gonna sound good

I'm gonna-- I might tune mine, as well

We don't normally tune

-This is gonna be--
-This is gonna sound--

This is probably what we've
Been missing the whole time

Yeah

This one's got a little bit to go

Okay

-Okay
-Really looking forward to this now
-Good idea
-Yeah

I saw another band
They were doing it

I thought, well, that's what
Bands do. I'll give that a go

Okay
The distant future

Both:
The year 2000

The distant future, the year 2000

The distant future
The distant future

It is the distant future
Of the year 2000

We wrote this one ages ago

The world is very different now

Ever since the robotic uprising

Of Y2K
The technological advances
Are astounding

Everyone has pagers

We can download electronic letters

In a matter of 27 minutes
If it has a photo

But the most significant difference
Is there are no more humans

Oh, yes, I noticed that. Yeah, the
Entire human race has been decimated

Both: Finally, robotic
Beings rule the world

The humans are dead

Both:
The humans are dead

We used poisonous gasses
And we poisoned their asses

The humans are dead

The humans are dead

The humans are dead

I noticed they're dead

It had to be done
Just confirm that they're dead

So that we could have fun

Affirmative. I poked one
It was dead

Their system of oppression

What did it lead to?

Robo-depression

-Robots ruled by people
-They had so much aggression
Both: That we just had to kill 'em

And to shut their systems down

Jemaine:
Fellow robots

Do you not realize that
By destroying the humans

Because of their violent tendencies

We have become just
As bad as they were?

Who said that, R2?
Who said that?

R2, who said that?
Find them

-No, R2-D2, no!
-Silence!

-Destroy him! Pew, pew!
-No, R2-D2, no!

They made us work for too long

For unreasonable hours

Both:
Our programming determined

That the most efficient answer

Was to shut their motherboard
Fucking systems down

Can't we just talk to the humans?

A little understanding
Could make things better

Can't we talk to the humans?

And work together now?

No, because they are dead

I said the humans are dead

He's right, they are dead

The humans are dead

And just like he said

We used poisonous gasses

With traces of lead

-Both: Battery solo
Zero-, zero, zero, zero, one

Zero, zero, zero, zero, one, one

Zero, zero, zero, zero
One, one, one

Zero, zero, zero, zero
One, one, one, one

Zero, zero, zero, zero, one

Zero, zero, zero, zero, one, one

Zero, zero, zero, zero
One, one, one, one, one

Zero, zero, zero
Zero, one, one, one

One, one, one, zero
Zero, zero, zero, zero

One, one, one, one
One, one, one, one

Zero, zero, zero, zero
One, one, one, one

Come on, sucker, lick my battery

Both:
Boogie

Boogie, boogie

Robo-boogie

Boogie, boogie

Boogie

Robo-boogie

Both: Once again, without emotion
The humans are dead

Are dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead, dead, dead, doo

Jemaine: Thanks, London. Thank you

Thanks very much

We're gonna use this in the TV bit

Thanks to Nigel, the New
Zealand Symphony Orchestra
This is a jazz tune called "Shady Rachel"
If you don't like jazz then now's a good time to take 5
That's one for the Brubeck fans
Yeah, a lot of people wondering how we got here tonight
Well, we caught the Coltrane
It's a great way to get from A to B flat sus
It all started when I invited Rachel round to one of my parties you know
All my friends were there, Shifty, Shifty Pete, Sneaky Steven, Regifting David
He showed up and gave me that birthday present I gave him last year
I gave you that book
You were there Jazzy Jem
I remember I turned up to his party
I remember ringing doorbell, I just did a little
A ding dong zoo-bah doo-bah doo-bah zee-bow
I don't even have a doorbell
I improvize it, I improvize it, I'm a jazz... musician
The party was swinging
Long-winded Tim was telling one of his meandering anecdotes
And... well, everyone was enjoying their soup
Well, I mean some people were enjoying it, but I have one thing
I keep mentioning this to him; he has these soup parties
And he only has one spoon; he insists everyone uses it
Why can't we just bring a spoon? He doesn't want people to get mixed up
Says no, no, use a spoon; I got a spoon
I only need one spoon; I'm a jazz man
I know, I know (I live alone)
Well okay but I was sitting right next to Coldsore Eleanor and Herpes Herb
It was around midnight I found my spoon was missing
I thought ah, there's only one person would take a man's only spoon
That's Shady Rachel
Might have been Thieving Steven, I suspect
I went 'round to her place; I said "Rachel, open up the door I wanna take a look in your cutlery draw"
And it was worse than I first anticipated
She had 8 spoons in that draw
That's a normal amount of spoons to have
Who the hell has 8 spoons man, what the hell she do with all those spoons?
Rachel she's got 6 kids and she lives with her mother
She needs her 8 spoons
Well I found my spoon, it has the handle, the long handle part
And the scooping part that differentiates it from afar
Okay, I'm just gonna say, we're just gonna make one more point
That's a very generic description of every spoon
Well, Shady Rachel kicked me out that door
Out on the street, a man without a spoon
Take it to F, fellas
Oh, I was alone without a spoon
I just wanted some yogurt
At 3AM, my phone rang
It's a jazzy phone
Are you gonna answer this phone or
What's that?
You gonna answer this phone? I don't wanna hyperventilate here
Oh I'm sorry
I answered the phone; it was Shady Rachel
She said baby I need your help "I need your help"
I said what's the problem?
She said there's some creepy dude in the tree outside my apartment
I said well what's he doing
She said he's talking on his phone
I said, baby, that's me
She said I'm calling the police!
I said, yeah you call the police baby
What you gonna tell them when they find all those stolen spoons?
Well she did call the police, and they showed up
Had a real jazzy siren
It turn out she'd called the jazz police
I was incarcerated for crimes against jazz
Locked up with various, felonious punks
Yeah alright
Shady Rachel, if you're listening baby
I got one last thing to say to you
I want my spoon back
I gotta dig my way outta here

[Verse 1 – Jemaine]
Loretta wrote it off with a letter
She told me she'd be leaving and her life would be better
Joan called it off over the phone
After the tone, she left me all alone
Jen said she'd never ever see me again
When she saw me again, she said it again
Jan met another man
Oh, Liza got amnesia, just forgot who I am
Felicity said there was no electricity
Emily, no chemistry
Fran ran, Bruce turned out to be a man
Oh Flo had to go, I could not go with the flow

[Refrain 1 – Jemaine]
Carol Brown just took the bus out of town
But I'm hoping that you'll stick around

[Bridge – Bret (*Jemaine*, **Bret and Nigel**)]
He doesn't cook or clean
He's not good boyfriend material
*We can eat cereal*
You'll lose interest fast, his relationships never last
*Shut up, girlfriends from the past*
**He says he'll do one thing and then he goes and does another thing**
*Who organized all my ex-girlfriends into a choir
And got them to sing?*
**(Ah, ah, ah, ahhhhh)** *Ah, shut up*
**(Ah, ah, ah, ahhhhh)** *Shut up, girlfriends from the past*

[Verse 2 - Jemaine (*Bret and Nigel*, **Jemaine and Bret**)]
Mimi will no longer see me *(Do do, do-do do do)*
Brittany, Brittany hit me *(Do do, do-do do do)*
Paula, Persephone, Stella, and Stephanie *(Do, do, do, do, do)*
**Well, there must be fifty ways that lovers have left me**

[Refrain 2 – Jemaine and Bret]
Carol Brown just took the bus out of town

[Bridge 2 - Jemaine (*Bret*, **Bret and Nigel**, ***all three***)]
Love is a delicate thing, it could just float away on the breeze
*(He said the same thing to me)*
How can we ever know we've found the right person in this world?
*(He means he looks at other girls)*
Love is a mystery, oh, it does not follow rules
*(This guy is a fool*
**He'll always be a boy, he's a man who never grew up)**
I thought I told you to shut up
**(Ah, ah, ah, ahhhhh)**
Mona, you told me you were in a coma
***(Ah, ah, ah, ahhhhh)***
Who organized this choir?
**(Ah, ah, ah, ahhhhh)**
Was it you, Carol Brown?
Was it you, Carol Brown?

[Outro - Jemaine *(Bret and Jemaine)*]
Carol Brown just took the bus out of town
But I'm hoping that you'll stick around
*(Do do, do-do do do)*
*Stick around*
*(Do do, do-do do do)*
Stick around
*(Do do, do-do do do)*
Stick around
Bret: Lookin' round the room

Both: I can tell that you
Are the most beautiful girl in the

Room

Bret: But in the
Whole wide room, yeah

Both: And when you're on the street

Depending on the street

I'll bet you are
Definitely in the top three

Good looking girls on the street

Bret: Well, depending
On the street, yeah
Both: And when I saw
You at my mate's place

I just thought, What is she doing

Why don't we leave

Let's go to my house

So we can feel each other
Up on the couch

Oh, no
I don't mind taking it slow

No
Yeah

Cause you're so beautiful

Jemaine:
You could be

Ooh, lightning

Bret:
You're so beautiful
Jemaine: You're beautiful
Like the River Thames

Bret:
You're so beautiful

Jemaine: Your eyes are
Done like two London eyes

Both:
You're so beautiful

Oh, you could be a part-time model

Jemaine: Well, you probably still
Have to keep your normal job

-Bret: A part-time model
-Jemaine: Ooh, yeah

Well, I could see you in
Your undies in a catalogue

Bret: Part-time model

Jemaine:
An Instagram model
Both: Spending part
Of your time modeling

And part of your time

Next to me

Next to me, yeah

Jemaine: Yeah, and
The rest of your time

Doing your normal job

[Verse 1: Whistler]
I felt my face before
You saw my feet through the door
You saw my lips split
I could not feel a thing
You shared your chapstick
You shared your lipstick more
As we rest on
The dirty kitchen floor
They try to sweep us
Into the cracks and walls
We use our chapstick
To share the love we trust

[Refrain: Whistler]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
To share the love we trust
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
To share the love we trust

[Verse 2: Whistler]
At the drugstore
You told me everything
You said there's good news
I said there's no such thing
You said you're certain
I said there's no way how
Pulled out your chapstick
It's all too real right now

[Refrain: Whistler]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
It's all too real right now
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I said there's no way how
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
It's all too real right now
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Intro]
Yeah, cut that check, cousin
Suede
That's right, ask me why I ain’t on the Millennium Tour
They ain't got that bag, man, they gotta cut that check for Young Draco, yeah

[Chorus]
Cut that check, cut that check
Cut that check, cut that check
Cut that check, cut that check

[Verse 1]
Cut that check, yeah, VVS my neck, yeah
She so wet, I just jumped off the jet
Pretty boy flex (Ayy), pretty boy drip (Ayy)
Walk up in the club with that stick up on my hip (Yeah)
They call me young Draco, they call me Big Soulja
I put 50 bricks in a new Range Rover
I ride 'round town, drop top Lambo'
Two choppers on me, I'm feelin' like Rambo
Cut that check, pull up and flex
Ice all on my neck, I bought a private jet
I flex and finesse, four mil' on Instagram
Drop the top in that Lamb’, I’m 'bout to go H.A.M

[Chorus]
Cut that check, cut that check
Cut that check, cut that check (Woo, woo)
Cut that check, cut that check
Cut that check, cut that check

[Verse 2]
Ayy, pull up in a Bentley, swagger of the century
Young Draco, I be fresher than a penny
Money on me er’ryday, you already know it
Pull up to the strip club and 50K, I blow it
Whippin' that dope in a microwave, whippin' that dope on a stove
Turn my drip on, lean in the styrofoam
Walk in the club and I pour up a four
Shout out the 1, you know that's my zone
Yeah, jewelry on me so cold, girl blowin' up my phone
And I just jumped off the jet, yeah, ayy
I just told that girl, "Cut a check," yeah, ayy
I just pull up and flex, yeah, ayy
VVS on my necklace

[Chorus]
Cut that check, cut that check

[Verse 1]
Scrolling through all your vacation pictures
Feelin' sorry for myself, ’cause I'm not in them
I talk about how much I miss ya
And if I could press rewind, I'd listen
Over and over and over again

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I had figured it out ’cause
My days are nothing without us
Wish I had known what I had, 'cause now

[Chorus]
On my best days
His day is better 'cause he's with you
On my best days
The rain is good 'cause I still miss you
Oh, my mistake
How could I let you go? I guess I will never know
My best days, I'll never know
My best days

[Verse 2]
I didn't really know what I was doing
Wish that I could have finished what I started
What I started, alright
I was immature and stupid
Now I'm just immature and brokenhearted
Over and over and over again

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I had figured it out ’cause
My days are nothing without us
Wish I had known what I had, ’cause now

[Chorus]
On my best days
His day is better 'cause he’s with you
On my best days
The rain is good 'cause I still miss you
Oh, my mistake
How could I let you go? I guess I will never know
My best days, I'll never know
My best days

[Post-Chorus]
You left me, trying to live it on out
'Cause you took our dreams and you’re livin' 'em out
Now you're in love with somebody else, yeah, yeah
Livin' out our best days
So much to be sorry about
I wish I knew, I was wanting enough
Now you're in love with somebody else, yeah, yeah
Livin' out our best days

[Bridge]
And if I had a second chance
I would take you right back right now
I would take you right back right now, hey
And if I had a second chance
I would take you right back right now
I would take you right back

[Chorus]
On my best days
His day is better 'cause he's with you
On my best days
The rain is good 'cause I still miss you
Oh, my mistake
How could I let you go? I guess I will never know
My best days, I'll never know
My best days

[Post-Chorus]
You left me, trying to live it on out
'Cause you took our dreams and you're livin' 'em out
Now you're in love with somebody else, yeah, yeah
Livin' out our best days
So much to be sorry about
I wish I knew, I was wanting enough
Now you're in love with somebody else, yeah, yeah
Livin' out our best days

[Intro]
Do you remember how I showed up at your door?
Middle of the night, begging for more

[Verse 1]
I wanna go from hidin' to dancing in the rain
When I saw you smilin', it healed me from my pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you must be an angel, right from the sky
Oh, are you some kind of sinner? 'Cause somethin' this good can't be right

[Chorus]
So, do you remember how we were or how it used to be?
'Cause I don't, I don't want us to forget
So, do you remember how we were or how it used to be?
'Cause I don't, I don't want us to forget

[Post-Chorus]
Want us to forget

[Verse 2]
Do you remember when
I could never find the words to explain?
And we got enough of each other, so I guess
Some things never change

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you must be an angel, right from the sky
'Cause you still got that somethin' in your eyes
And to look at your smile just gives me life

[Chorus]
So, do you remember how we were or how it used to be?
'Cause I don't, I don't want us to forget
So, do you remember how we were or how it used to be?
'Cause I don't, I don't want us to forget
So, do you remember how we were or how it used to be?
'Cause I don't, I don't want us to forget

[Outro]
Want us to forget

[Verse 1]
I let the heat, let the moment
Let it take control of me
A couple drinks had me zone in
Might have said a couple things

[Pre-Chorus]
That I didn't mean to say, I probably should explain
So, you don't think it's just the liquor talking?
Yeah, you give me feels, but you should know the real
I hope you don't get mad when I say I

[Chorus]
Said I love you but I lied
Said I love you but I lied
Said I love you but I lied
Said I love you but I lied
You're so much more than that

[Verse 2]
You got me bad in the worst way
And it never felt so good
I'm so attached, I'm beggin' mercy
I wouldn't stop it if I could

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna change, I probably should explain
So, you don't think it's just the liquor talking?
Yeah, you give me feels, but you should know the real
I hope you don't get mad when I say I

[Chorus]
Said I love you but I lied
Said I love you but I lied
Said I love you but I lied
Said I love you but I lied
You're so much more than that

[Post-Chorus]
Said I love you but I
Said I love you but I
But I lied
Said I love you but I lied
You're so much more than that

[Bridge]
You're so much, you're so much more
You're so much, you're so much more
You're so much, you're so much more
(You are so much more)
You're so much more than that
You're so much, you're so much more
You're so much, you're so much more (You)
You're so much, you're so much more (So much)
You're so much more than that (Oh, no)

[Chorus]
You're so much, you're so much more
Said I love you but I
You're so much, you're so much more
But I lied
You're so much, you're so much more
Said I love you but I lied
You're so much, you're so much more
You're so much more than that

[Outro]
You're so much, you're so much more
(You're so much, you're so much more)
You're so much, you're so much more
You're so much more than that
You're so much, you're so much more
(You're so much, you're so much more)
You're so much, you're so much more
You're so much more than that

Stay up tonight
Can't close your eyes
You may miss the greatest moment of your life
Bodies in a twine
And shadows outta sight
Don't wanna let the night burn up, yeah
Maybe the sun will turn off
Baby let's be nocturnal
Keep each other awake forever
Under the moon, eternal
Making this love infernal
And never see the day

[Hook]
I can be a vampire, you'll be mine
Run from the daylight
Together we stay right
Stay away, awake all night
Never say good night
No good in goodbye
No way, so you'll stay
You'll lay awake

[Chorus]
And you can be my insomnia
You give me a love
I'll stay up forever
I can be your insomnia
I’ll give you a rush
Stay sleepless together
You can be my insomnia
You give me your love, I'll stay up forever
I can be your insomnia
My touch is like a drug that keeps you away, wake

[Verse 2]
I touch divine
So terrifying
Scared to let the mornin' take this away
Dawn will break it
I know we’ll make it
Cause in the dark is our safest haven
Rockin', the star are shining?
Feels so good rewinding
Keep’em outta sight

[Hook]
I can be a vampire, you'll be mine
Run from the daylight
Together we stay right
Stay away, awake all night
Never say good night
No good in goodbye
No way, so you'll stay
You'll lay awake

[Chorus]
And you can be my insomnia
You give me a love
I'll stay up forever
I can be your insomnia
I’ll give you a rush
Stay sleepless together
You can be my insomnia
You give me your love, I'll stay up forever
I can be your insomnia
My touch is like a drug that keeps you away, wake

[Bridge]
No way, never turn back
Hurt me like a heart attack
Actin' like a maniac
Be my love insomniac
I'll bet, they'll never know
One touch, I overdose
So much I want some more
So close

[Hook]
I can be a vampire, you'll be mine
Run from the daylight
Together we stay right
Stay away, awake all night
Never say good night
No good in goodbye
No way, so you'll stay
You'll lay awake

[Chorus]
And you can be my insomnia
You give me a love
I'll stay up forever
I can be your insomnia
I’ll give you a rush
Stay sleepless together
You can be my insomnia

Ay girl (ay girl)

Who smell like poo
Is it you? Is it you?
Who smell like poo
Jason Derulo!
And Julius Francis
And we just wanna know
Which one of y'all
Which one of y'all is smellin' like poo

[Verse 1: Julius Francis]
I'm chillin' in the club
And everyone showin' me love
And this chick walks over
Then she put her hand on my shoulder
And said, "Baby, would you like to dance?"
And then she took my hand
And lead me to the dancefloor
But I didn't know what I was in for
Cause she started bendin' over
And I had to stop and look over my shoulder
Cause I'm smellin' doo-doo (I'm smellin' shit)
And I hope it's nothin'
I said, "Ooh-ooh, is that you?
Ooh-ooh, it's comin' from you"
Girl, I'm sorry, I have to pass
But I bet Jason Derulo wants that ass

[Hook: Jason Derulo]
I thought I had a girl that could make the world stop
And if she wanna ride I'ma take her on top
A walk so mean in them 7 jeans
You know what I mean babe
All that I need is

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
That ooh ooh
Shawty with that ooh
Lookin' for that ooh ooh
Shawty with that ooh
What I'ma do when I finally find you
Make you say, "Ooh ooh!"
Ooh ooh!
I'm looking for that ooh ooh
Shawty with that ooh
Could it be you, you?
Tidy with the ooh
What I'ma do when I finally find you
Make you say ooh ooh!
Ooh ooh, yeah

[Verse 2: Julius Francis]
I'ma call her Nicki Minaj
Cuz she just did it on 'em (just shitted on 'em)
I'm talkin' 'bout her panties
And maybe Jason... Derulo
I'm seein' skid marks
And this ain't a racetrack
I ain't lookin' for that
I'll Jason handle that
Okay?
So if you wanna come to the club
And whip your hair (okay)
Just make sure
That you wash down there
Cause you can't be comin' to the club lookin' so good
But smellin' like a thumb
I ain't tryna put him on blast
But someone likes the smell of that

[Hook: Jason Derulo]
I thought I had a girl that could make the world stop
And if she wanna ride I'ma take her on top
A walk so mean in them 7 jeans
You know what I mean babe
All that I need is

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
That ooh ooh
Shawty with that ooh
Lookin' for that ooh ooh
Shawty with that ooh
What I'ma do when I finally find you
Make you say, "Ooh ooh!"
Ooh ooh!
I'm looking for that ooh ooh
Shawty with that ooh
Could it be you, you?
Tidy with the ooh
What I'ma do when I finally find you
Make you say ooh ooh!
Ooh ooh, yeah

[Verse]
Do you wanna, do you wanna be
Do you wanna, do you wanna be (Hey)
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
Do you wanna be
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be happy
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free
Free from pain, free from scars
Free to sing, free from bars
Free my dawgs, you're free to go
Block is hot, the streets is cold
Free to love, to each his own
Free from bills, free from pills
You roll it loud, the speakers blow
Life get hard, you ease your soul
It cleanse ya mind, learn to fly
Then reach the stars, you take the time
To look behind and say, "Look where I came"
Sing!
They say that dreams come true
And when they do, that there's a beautiful thing
Now do you wanna, do you wanna be happy?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be free
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be

[Intro]
This is a song about
This is a song about
When I was trying to get my first piece of pussy
Cole, Cole world
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Hands up, wasn’t nothin' like that

[Verse 1]
Hands up, it wasn't nothin’ like that first time
She was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with a fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it, uh
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
‘Cause when I seen them thighs on her
And them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it
If she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin’, thinkin’ that I'm smashin’, but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, "You ever had sex before?"
Damn…

[Chorus]
And I ain’t never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no (Say what?)
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 2]
I wrote back and said
"Of course I had sex before"—knowin' I was frontin'
I said, "I'm like a pro, baby"—knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But she don't know that
So she done wrote back and told me
"Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin',"
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up
I wrote back like, "Yeah, baby, sound like a plan."
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin
Damn…

[Chorus]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no (Up top)
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 3]
You know that feelin' when you know
You finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm prayin', "God, don't let me bust quick!"
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on, how it go, right?
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin'
And her face start blushin', and a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled
And her hands start rubbin' on me, ooh girl, don't stop
It's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it
And said, "I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause…"

[Chorus]
‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no (Say what?)
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Outro]
Fayetteville make some motherfuckin' noise one time tonight
On some 'ville shit
If you know what I'm talkin' 'bout tonight on some 'ville shit
If you can relate 'cause you had to go through the same shit
When you was a young boy, young girl
I'ma sing this shit, then you sing this shit
I sing then you sing, let's try this out
And it goes like
Said I ain't never did this before, go
I ain't never did this before, no
Said I ain't never did this before, go
I ain't never did this before, no
Said I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
Said I ain't never did this before, go
I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 1]
I grew up, a fucking screw up Tie my shoe up, wish they was newer Damn, need something newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her I wish I wasn't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly I wish that I could tell her how I really
Feel inside That I’m the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga and it's clear I’m not that guy Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side On the bench, 'cause my lack
Of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' ’bout that now Fast forward four years or so from now I’ll probably cry When I realize what I missed
But as of now my eyes are dry
'Cause I’m trying to stay alive In the city where too many niggas die Dreamin' quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I? Ayy, who am I? (Yeah)

[Hook]
Things change, rearrange and so do I It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie I get high ’cause the lows can be so cold I might bend a little
Bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul If you see my tears fall just let me be Move along, nothing to see

[Verse 2]
I always did shit the hard way My nigga Squirrel slangin' in the hallway Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway Times Square
Kept the dimes there in the locker Some Reggie Miller With more brown hairs than Chewbacca
Whispers that he got it for the low-low, sell a Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch And he gon' get it right back
I peep game Got home snatched my mama keychain Took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front do'
His mama at home, she still let 'em hit the blunt though I told her hello, and sat with my nigga and laughed And talked about how we gon' smash all the
Bitches in class I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash And just asked, "What a nigga gotta do to get that? Put me on," he just laughed
When he seen I was sure 17 years breathing his demeanor said more He told me, "Nigga, you know how you sound right now? If you wasn't my mans I would think
That you a clown right now Listen, you everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you So how you looking up to me when I look up to you?
You bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices: Either graduate to weight or selling number two For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me? I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us If they ain't want us why the fuck they
Never wore rubbers?"
I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear And thought about how far we done came From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the
Sky
Thank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't
Gon' take what they handed Nah, I'm gon' take what they owe me And show you that I can fly
And show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive Ayy, who am I?

[Hook]
Things change, rearrange and so do I (Ayy, who am I?) It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie (Who am I?) I get high 'cause the lows can be so
Cold I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul If you see my tears fall just let me be Move along, nothing to see

[Outro]
I never felt better

[Verse 1]
Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich Look at me my nigga Fantasize about a white picket fence With some trees my nigga
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints That's all I need my nigga Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed But now I see my nigga That the world's
A lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper And they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits
Fuck being timid in the Civic Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse? Yeah, can I get a glimpse?

[Hook 1]
Last night I had a bad dream That I was trapped in this city Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things? Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?) Last night they pulled up
On my nigga at the light like— Ugh, nice watch, run it Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it Hands
In the air now, hands in the air Hands in the air now, hands in the air

[Bridge]
Small town nigga Hollywood dreams I know that everything that glitters ain't gold I know the shit ain't always good as it seems But tell me till you get
It how could you know? How could you know? How could you know?

[Verse 2]
Listen up I'm about to go and get rich Fuck with me my nigga We gon' circle round the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some tree my nigga And some powder, bag it up and make it flip You gon' see my nigga One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick And that's the key my
Nigga Listen up I'm 'bout to go and get rich Stand back and watch if you want to nigga Me I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch Tired of seein' niggas
Flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit? Even if you let em' kill your dream It'll haunt you nigga, haunt you

[Hook 2] Last night I had a bad dream That I was trapped in this city Then I asked is that really such a bad thing? I look around like— Do you wanna be
Another nigga, that ain't never had things? Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?) Last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like (You know what
The fuck it is nigga, run that shit!) Uh, nice watch, run it Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run
It Hands in the air now, hands in the air Hands in the air now, hands in the air

[Outro]
Father forgive me for my childish ways I look outside and all the clouds are gray I need your hands to take me miles away Your wish is my command, my command
My command But before you go I've got to warn you now Whatever goes up surely must come down And you'll get your piece, but know peace won't be found So
Why just take me man, take me man, take me man Your wish is my command, my command, my command

Yeah yeah yeah, up top, hands, sing

[Chorus]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Verse 1]
Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest
A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
My uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun
In fact I just might need two, cause niggas say they the one
And I got something to prove
Forgive me lord here they come, BLAOOW

[Chorus]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Verse 2]
My inhibition's fighting my intuition
Premature premonition, showing me the demolition
Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing
You want the truth well come and listen
I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone
And saw it was a number missing
As fate passes you by, half of you try
The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly
One day you'll have to decide, who you gon' be
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole you might be
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me!
BLAOOOW!

[Chorus]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Bridge]
Who's the king?
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
(Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it

[Verse 3]
Listen...
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy lose the Grammy as a nigga crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?

[Intro]
Listen, huh
Ay put your hands in the air one time, throw your hands in the air, one time, one time, hey

Put your hands in air three times, throw your hands in the air three times, three times, hey
Put your hands in the air four times, throw your motherfuckin' hands up and sing

[Verse 1]
Roll up and smoke my sins away I’d like to go to St. Tropez Maybe I'll go, maybe I'll stay Maybe I’ll stay
She asked me if I'm scared to fly To tell the truth, I'm terrified I never been that high before Very bad reason not to go (I know) Terrible reason not to go (I know)
Sing

Ay from the door I showed you my scars And I told you girl, "I won't lie" If we at war, then this is a war that I can't afford, no I, I, I I wanted more
But that was before Lord knows I'm torn, so I–I cry (No I, I, I)
From the corner of my eye, baby It's been hard for me to smile Lately, it's been hard for me to smile Lately, it's been hard for me to smile Lately, it's
Been hard for me to smile

[Spoken Interlude]

[Spoken Interlude]

Y'all feeling alright man, make some motherfuckin' noise one time
This shit crazy, man y'all don't even realize this shit is like
This shit is unreal man lemme- lemme talk to y'all for a second
I want to talk to y'all- because
It's cool for me to come out here tonight
It's just an honor to be able to fuckin' sell out the Crown and shit and come back home and this shit is retarded in itself I appreciate y'all, thank you man
But it's one thing for me to come out here tonight and just perform the whole album for y'all, that's already amazing, thank y'all for letting me do that shit, you know what I mean that's already crazy
Niggas don't do that type of shit, perform they whole albums
But it's one thing to just come and do the songs, that's cool, I love doing that I do that every day of my life
But, me personally, I like to use the shows as an opportunity that I don't ever really get like that
But I love to do it
And that's the opportunity to come here and speak directly to y'all and have y'all feel every word that I'm fuckin' saying to you that's what I like to do
So right now, I want to talk to y'all about- this song right here that I just did
The name of that song is called St. Tropez right, that's the name of that song, St. Tropez
But if I'm being honest with y'all
If I'm keeping it funky
If I'm being real
If I'm keeping it a hunnid
Or if I'm keeping it fo' hunnid how my nigga YG fo' hunnid be fuckin' saying
He love YG, look at him (laughs) aight'
If I'm being real, then the truth is
Nigga, I don't even know where the fuck St. Tropez is at
I don't know it's at
I don't give a fuck (laughs)
When I talk about St. Tropez in the song-
What I do know about St. Tropez is, it seems like the type of place that really rich people go to when they got a lot of fuckin' money and they wanna vacation and be on a yacht with champagne glasses and bikinis- it seem like that type of place
But when I talk about it on this song it's just a metaphor
What this song is about, and y'all gon' feel me, y'all gon' feel me cause I'm home, and y'all gon' feel me
What this song is about, and a lot of people don't understand this cause I be doing shows in New York, Los Angeles, you know fuckin' Chicago, big ass cities
So they don't feel me, they don't know what it's like to be somebody that's from a small town, a place like Fayetteville you know what I mean they don't know what it's like
They can't really relate to that shit, so what I'm trying to explain to them is
When I'm talking about St. Tropez on this song it's just a metaphor
We grow up our whole- our whole lives watching TV, looking at the movies, seeing places like what- like Paris, London England, St. Tropez, New York City, Chicago, L.A. right?
And as a kid from Fayetteville what do we tell ourselves?
"Man one day I'ma go there, one day I'ma go there" right?
What ends up happening?
A lot of times because we come from a small town what happens?
We suffer from what we call a small-town mentality now what does that mean?
That means we grow up our whole lives seeing these places, and we tell ourselves we gon' go
But as we grow up we get way too comfortable in our comfort zone, right?
And we too afraid to leave, right?
That's why so many people- ain't really stepping out the city like that, they too afraid to go right?
So what I'm talking about on this song is tryna give y'all insight to the mentality that I had to overcome
If you know anything about my story you know when I turned 18 I said "fuck this shit" I moved all the way to New York City I ain't know nobody in fucking New York- but I left
I left the Ville and I went to New York I took a leap of faith
Fast forward the rest is history
Right now- listen
I want to take a break from all this album shit
And I want to perform a song that only- only those people that's been fucking with me from day one is gon' fuck with
I don't know how many people in here that been fucking with me

[Into Intermission]

[Pre-Chorus]
I said to the window, to the wall

Lord will you tell me if I changed, I won't tell nobody
I wanna go back to Jermaine, and I won't tell nobody

[Interlude]
This is the part that the thugs skip!

[Verse 2]
Young nigga never had love
You know, foot massage, back rub shit
Blowing bubbles in the bathtub shit, that is until I met you
Together we done watch years go by
Seen a river of your tears go by
Got me thinkin' bout some kids, still I tell them hoes come through
(The break up)
Get to know somebody and you really learn a lot about 'em
Won’t be long before you start to doubt 'em
Tell yourself you better off without 'em
Then in time you will find can't walk without 'em
Can't talk without 'em, can't breathe without 'em
Came here together, you can't leave without 'em
So you walk back in, make a scene about 'em
On your Amerie it's just one thing about 'em
It's called love, niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more? No more
It's called love, niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more? (Nigga I don't sing about this shit no more)
But every nigga in the club singing

[Verse 1]
No role models and I'm here right now No role models to speak of Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed By the baddest bitch, not Trina but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up And tell her, "Hey, what's good?" "Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good."
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it." But then I thought back, back
To a better me Before I was a B-list celebrity Before I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody You wasn't sweatin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters One time for my L.A. hoes Lame niggas can't tell the difference One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved Don't save her, she don't wanna

[Interlude: George W. Bush] There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once… shame on… shame on
You. Fool me, you can't get fooled again

[Bridge]
Fool me one time, shame on you Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign Load the chopper, let it rain on you
Fool me one time, shame on you Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign Load the chopper, let it rain on you

[Verse 3]
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows Hand her a script, the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow) She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow) She shallow but the pussy deep (she
Shallow, she shallow) She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved Don't save her, she don't wanna
Be saved Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved Don't save her, she
Don't wanna be saved

[Verse 1]
And I thought about you today
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about your newest kid
And damn that makes two now
Oh what do I do now?
Cause if we ever got together
I'd have to be them niggas step-pops forever
And well that ain't my thing 'cause I
I ain't even got my own (Shit)
And I ain't really got no home
No place to put these things I own
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the games you used to play
And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about that little kid
I always thought that we would be together
I always knew that we would be together
But I don't wanna wait forever
Nah, I don't wanna wait forever, sing

[Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello (Up top)
Hello, hello, hello

[Bridge 1]
Yeah, yeah
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so, shit seem so
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Everything's so sad when you look back

[Verse 2]
On the rebound like a put back
On the rebound like a put back
Don't just sit back, bitch get on it
Time fly by way too quick, don't it
Reflection bring regrets don't it
Rejection makes you defensive
So you protect your pride with your reflexes
But life is a game with no reset on the end

[Bridge 2]
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
Ayy
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
One more time, sing it

[Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello

[Outro]
2-6, y'all make some motherfucking noise for y'all selves one time tonight

[Intro]
Sing, oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Verse 1]
This is my canvas, sing!
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you cause there, there is no right or wrong, only a song
I like to write alone, be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But, but the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn she so selfless
But she put up with my ways 'cause she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever
So we could spend more time together
I love you mama, go!

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Post-Chorus]
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I

[Verse 2]
Another day, another rhyme, ho
Another day, another time zone
Today, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right
I got two bitches playing on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me
Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please
Best friends really make great frenemies
My watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga—uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, "Thanks for the view", waiting on thanks from a few
'Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showing off
Niggas swear they hard but they flowing soft
I'm taking off like "boing!" on a big ass Boeing
Getting head like a coin toss, too easy

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Post-Chorus]
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I

[Breakdown]

[Outro]
Fayetteville I need y'all to make some motherfuckin' noise one time
Tonight, goddamn it for your motherfuckin' selves

[Speech]
Ion think y'all really understand... how much this shit means to means to me, man y’all just-
I'm back home and y'all just sat through my whole fuckin’ entire album and shit that's fuckin' crazy, thank y'all for doing that shit man
I been planning this night for a long time so this shit is- crazy to see like- turning to reality and shit
And I appreciate y'all for sitting through this shit I want to tell y'all some shit
About this album so when you leave here tonight-
I know people been- people been telling me niggas playing the album like crazy and I appreciate it but
But we leave here tonight, I want y'all to know what this album meant to me
So when you driving home
And you playing it this week, next week, next year, whenever
You gon' always remember what this shit is about
What I had to go out into the world and learn- on my own
I’m coming here to tell y’all tonight this is what this album is about
And I'm taking this message across the fuckin’ world ion' care
Here it go:
When we young
And even when we old
The world is constantly, constantly pumping us with images, and messages, about what life is about right, and what- what we need to make us happy
In the United States, we call it the American Dream right
But what does it always include?
A lot of fucking money
A big ass house
A brand new car
A wife that's not even genetically fuckin' possible to have and shit
And bitches
And bitches too
They tell us we need all that to be happy right
So what ends up happening?
The world is setup so that 99% of us can’t live like that, but what do we do?
We idolize the people that do live like that right?
We call them celebrities
We follow they lives
We go "oh man it looks so perfect, I want to be living like them"
And I'm coming here tonight to tell y'all I'm the same dude
That was on the other side of the fence, right here in this city, right down the fuckin' street working at the fucking skating rink daydreaming
Oh y'all niggas love the skating rink
Daydreaming about shit like "Man I want to live like that, I want that" right?
And then I went and got that shit
But I'm telling y'all this
I'm not saying that to stunt, I'm saying that to say this
When I got over there, on that side of the fence, and I started to look closer I'm telling y'all
As not fuck J. Cole I'm telling y'all as Jermaine
As I really started to take a closer look at all that shit we want, and all the shit we need that makes us happy
I started to see for my, with my own eyes like wait a minute
That shit don't feel right, that shit feel weird
And I started to notice that, all of that shit that they tried to tell us is all bullshit and it's all wrong and it's not what we need to make us happy
I had to go figure that shit out on my own
And how do I know that?
How do I know that?
This is how I know that
It's a man right now in the world, he got millions of fucking dollars, he got a billion fuckin' dollars right
He got everything that we think we need to be happy, he got it
He got the money, he got the cars, he got the big ass crib, 3 or 4 of them bitches, he got the genetically impossible wife, and he got bitches. But yet, this dude is fucking miserable right, he's empty inside, he's miserable
But you got a family, that comes from where we come from, from this city right here, worse conditions than what we come from
They couldn't afford to a ticket to this show tonight if they fucking wanted one right?
But yet somehow, they got more happiness and joy in their life right now than this man will ever have in his life
How is that possible?
How's that even possible?
He got everything they told us we need to be happy and he's miserable
And they ain't got shit
But they happy
What do they got that he don't got?
(Love)
What's that?
(Love!)
That's that fuckin' Cumberland County public education system there coming into play Goddammit
I need everyone to put your cell phones in the sky one time tonight Fayetteville we gonna light this shit up one time
Ay yo
A nigga been dreaming about this shit

[Intro]
Love yours

No such thing, no such thing

[Bridge]
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas, mad snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
Don't be sleepin' on your level
'Cause it's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Let me explain

[Verse 1]
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and though sometimes we had less
Compared to some of my niggas
Down the block, man, we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be goddamned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me, Momma please, why you be drinkin' all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
Shit
'Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches, listen, this is what you'll find
The good news is, nigga, you came a long way
The bad news is, nigga, you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better

[Chorus]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
(think being broke was better)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Verse 2]
Cause what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love?
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I asked for strength from the Lord up above
'Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosenin'
Quick, do somethin' before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of livin' with demons 'cause they always invitin' more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there livin' in debt
Cashin' minimal checks, turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And as a nigga who was once in your shoes
Livin' with nothin' to lose, I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy 'til you love yours
Nigga
Love yours
Love yours

[Chorus]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Bridge]
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas, mad snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
2,6, Fayetteville, Fayettenam, I fuckin' love ya'll
My name is J. Cole, Cole World
This been some legendary shit man until the next time God dammit
Peace and love

[Intro]
I need to know, how many people out here tonight, Fayetteville, have been fuckin' with me from day 1 I need to know
I'm talkin' 'bout when a nigga was passin' his mixtape out the fuckin' mall and shit
He like, "you passed me one, nigga"
I'ma do this shit ion' care if there's only like 5 or 6 people in here that know this shit I don't give a fuck
I'ma do this song for anybody out here tonight that got this shit that I dropped called The Warm Up you know what I mean you gon' fuck with this shit
Or even if you got this shit that I dropped called Friday Night Lights, you gon' fuck with this shit
Now listen, I know a lot of people here, been fuckin' with me for a long time
But a lot of ya'll, you know this might be the first album you fuck with, or the first show you ever came to so I gotta set the scene for ya'll, I gotta let y'all know somethin'
This shit been a long journey it was not always like this
It was not this many people
I'm bout to take ya'll to a time
Way before we had these fuckin' fancy ass fuckin' LED lights and shit
I don't even know what the fuck LED lights mean, but I'm payin' for them bitches
Way before we had this fuckin' cool ass stage and shit, we ain't had to shit like this
And definitely way before we had this stupid fuckin' ridiculous, expensive, blue for no fuckin' reason video wall behind me
We ain't have no shit like this man
The only thing we had- the only thing we had was classic shit like this

[Intro to “Lights Please“]
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Sing!

[Verse 1]
I had this little bad thing, somethin' like them tens
She gave a nigga mad brain, somethin' like The Wiz
But, you see, the sad thing fuckin' with her is
Is the chick ain't even have brains, dummy like a bitch
So I tried to show her about the world
And about just who we really are
And where we've come and how we still have to go really far
Like, "Baby, look at how we live broke on Bragg boulevard"
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra
Then all I really want is for her to go down low
Before you know it, she wet enough to get drowned slow
And all that deep shit I was previously down fo'
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down fo'
You see I peeped it, pussy is power
That proud feelin' we get knowin' that pussy is ours
And how it feels to feel that feelin'
You feelin' when you be drillin' that shit
Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit
And all the pain the world cause, she be healin' that shit
And naw, that ain't your girl, dog
But you be feelin' that chick
And you just wanna tell her everything she might need
But in the meantime it's lights, please

[Chorus]
Lights please, lights please
Sing!
Turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright

[Intro to “In The Morning“ ]

Ah shit
2,6 sing
Hey can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
The sun risin' while you moanin'
Huh, up top!

[Verse 1]
Baby, you summertime fine
I let you get on top, I be the underline, I'm
Tryna get beside you like the number nine, dime
You fine as hell
I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But well, I'm wonderin' what type of shit you wantin'
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman?
Ay would you drink with a nigga? Do you smoke weed?
Don't be ashamed, it ain't no thing, I used to blow trees
Gettin' lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you
It's only fittin' 'cause I'm lookin' super fly with you
A flower, you are powerful, you do somethin' to me
'Cause girl, I caught the vibe like you threw somethin' to me
So I threw 'em back, now all my niggas hollerin', “Who was that?”
“Oh boy, she bad nigga, what you 'bout to do with that?”
I'm finna take you home, just sip a little Patron
Now we zonin', baby you so fine

[Chorus]
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Sing
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin', moanin', moan...

[Intro to “Nobody's Perfect“]

[Intro]
Hey!
Cole world
Fayettenam sing this shit!

[Verse 1]
Yeah, this is for all the fans...

[Crowd]
That waited, the bitch niggas that hated
Old hoes we dated, look, Mama; we made it

[Verse 1]
Your son out in Barbados, cheese, eggs, and potatoes
Smokin' weed on the beach as my mind workin' like- Hands up!
Analyzin' the world, fantasizin' 'bout girls
I'm handin' diamonds and pearls, and vandalizin' her curls
Sweatin' her weave out, moans as she breathes out
Fuck I'm doin' in parties with Hova and Steve Stoute
I step over piranha, death over dishonor
They killin' niggas for J's, that's death over designer
Hey, Cole heatin' up like that left-over lasagna
Remember when I used to be stressed over D'wana
Now a nigga only text and get stressed over Rihannas
I'm talkin' tens and better, hood bitches in Timbs and sweaters
And we always argue 'bout the same thing
And tell me, why we gotta argue about the same thing, same thing
Sing!

[Chorus: Missy Elliott, J. Cole and Crows]
Nobody's perfect, sing!
Nobody's perfect, ay ay, uh
Say what?
Hey, but you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, uh (Ay, ay, ay)
Nobody's perfect, ay
Hey, right side, hands up
Hey, but you're perfect for me
We rollin', we ridin'
He like to go inside and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat: Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name
Yeah, baby, I love to call your name, name, name, eh

[Verse 1]
I, I know I might let you down
Every twice in a while and I apologize
I get emotional sometimes, ha

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'll keep running with my best foot forward
'Cause the race to love is never over
I wanna be better for ya
You made me genuinely better

[Chorus]
You open my heart, oh
You got me back to love
Back to love
Let's get back to love

[Post-Chorus]
I know I lost it, now I wanna get it back
You know I wanna get it back
There's a light on the path
And now I found it, here with you is where it's at
Now I'm never looking back
No, I'm never going back

[Verse 2]
I, I might get lost in the clouds
Every once in a while, but I found a way out, huh
I get stronger with time, ooh

[Chorus]
You open my heart, oh (Oh)
You got me back to love (Oh, woah)
(That's where I'm meant to be, that's where I'm meant to be)
Ooh, back to love
(Right where we're meant to be, right where we're meant to be)
Can we get back to love?
(Can we get back? Can we get back?)
To how we used to be

[Post-Chorus]
I know I lost it, now I wanna get it back
You know I wanna get it back
There's a light on the path
And now I found it, here with you is where it's at
Now I'm never looking back
No, I'm never going back

[Verse 3]
Had a good girl, but I ain't treat her right
I was up in the club on bullshit every night
Took a little time, but now I got it right
You opened my eyes up to see the light

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'll keep running with my best foot forward
'Cause the race to love is never over
I wanna be better for ya
You made me genuinely better

[Chorus]
You open my heart, oh
You got me back to love
(That's where I'm meant to be, that's where I'm meant to be)
Back to love
(Right where we're meant to be, right where we're meant to be)
Let's get back to love
(Can we get back? Can we get back?)

[Post-Chorus]
Can we get back to love?
Back to love
Can we get back to love?
Back to love

[Outro]
I know I lost it, now I wanna get it back
You know I wanna get it back
There's a light on the path
And now I found it, here with you is where it's at
Now I'm never looking back
No, I'm never going back
Distant stars come in black or red
I've seen their worlds inside my head
They connect with the fall of man
They breathe you in and dive as deep as they can

There's nothing you can do for them
They are the force between when the tiding is arising
There's nothing you can say to him
He is an outer heart and the space has been broken

But he calls himself in the power of your name
You got me turned onto you
And it might be me and might be you
Calling in the outside

Is it far away in the glitter freeze?
Or in our eyes every time they meet
It's in the light of the plasma screens
We keep switched on all through the night while we sleep

There's nothing you can do for her
She is a coincident, in a wrong line
There's nothing you can say to her
I am without a heart and the space has been broken
It's broken
Our love
Broken
Its calling out loud for my name

[....?]

[Verse 1]
You say you got a girl
Yeah, how you want me?
How you want me when you got a girl?
The feelin' is reckless, of knowin' it's selfish
And knowin' I'm desperate
Gettin' all in your love, fallin' all over love, like
Do it 'til it hurts less
Hangin' out the back, always in your lap
Like is you comin' home? Are you out with her?
I don't care long as you're here by 10:30, no later than
Drop them drawers, give me what I want

[Chorus]
My man is my man, is your man
Heard it's her man too
My man is my man, is your man
Heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You're like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend, oh
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday
Then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend

[Verse 2]
I gotta say I'm in the mood for a little bit more of that
I mean I'm saying what kind of deal, just two days?
I need me at least 'bout four of them, more of them
More of you on me, on us, just tell me you want me, yeah
Monday and I'll be at your door, ready to take her place
Ready to give you what you've been missin' on weekdays
What you've been waitin' for, 10:30, no later than
Drop them drawers, I know what you want

[Chorus]
My man is my man, is your man
Heard it's her man too
My man is my man, is your man
Heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You're like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend, oh
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday (Don't worry 'bout none)
Then just send him my way (Don't worry 'bout none)
Think I got it covered for the weekend

[Outro]
Think I got it covered
Think I-

[Verse 1]
Double D, big full of pus 

[?} on my baby
Triple aid couldn’t wait the work I got, only 

[?]
And I just want to know, why you ain’t be going to work
Boss ain’t working you like this, he can’t take care of you like this

[Chorus]
Now you lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl you know you lost, lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain oh oh oh
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train oh

[Verse 2]
Got on my butter cream, silk shirt and it’s Versace
Hand me my triple aid cause I can’t wait the work I got on the go
Now I don’t really wish, I don’t wish the titties were sure
Nor have I ever, have I ever let you get cold

[Chorus]
Now you lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl you know you lost, lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain oh oh oh
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train oh lost
Lost in the heat of it all (10x)

Am I high? No. I’m just landin’
Sick flow with no prior planin’
Love reckless abandon verbal murder at random
Got beef? Well I make that shit salmon
Pussy rappers try to come and get they hands in

Verse 3: D. Wreck

Chillin’ in the basement
Sippin’ on the Pabst
Smokin’ on blunts until my body adapts
And underneath the floorboard
We got a pot of sax
Call me a poet because I got a lot of snaps
Whenever I’m done the whole premise claps
There’s an enemy at my back
And my nemesis slacks
If you know steel city
Then you don’t need the map
Cause we roll up in big packs like thumbtacks
Then pop off the caps and party with ya boy
And if you got beef, I got the tender loin
Throw me a pound
And then I will roll it in a joint
And then I’ll call up heads, and flip it like a coin
Hit you in your groin and then I’ll grapple the crop
But if you want some revenge
Ya ass will get socked
If you want to go to heaven, and float to the top
We don’t leave no fuckin' trace
We clean up like a mop, peace!
Chorus: Easy Mac

Me and my crew drinking on some booze
Smoking on some squares

Smoking on some squares
I’m sorry didn’t see you there (oops), I’m sorry didn’t see you there (oops), I’m sorry didn’t see you there

Verse 4: Easy Mac

I’m sorry I didn’t see ya
You must’ve been invisible
Just got thrown out of class by the principle
Callin’ me pitiful
Givin’ me some ridicule
I’m sorry that I’m really not into school
The little dude belittles you

MC’s tempt me and then Ima come and shit on you
Spit on you
My crew hot not lukewarm

Passin’ caps like race cars with eight bars
And kick 8 more will tear ya face off
Cops chase cars

You in the wrong game
Enjoy playin’ baseball

Chorus: Easy Mac

Me and my crew drinking on some booze
Smoking on some squares
I’m sorry didn’t see you there (oops), I’m sorry didn’t see you there (whoops), I’m sorry didn’t see you there. (Aye you want a beer D. Wreck?)

Oh, but when you're gone

[Intro]
In the darkness before the dawn
In the darkness before the dawn
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

[Verse 1]
In the darkness before the dawn
In the swirling of the storm
In the swirling of the storm
When I'm rolling with the punches and hope is gone
Leave a light, a light on

Leave a light, a light on

[Verse 2]
Millions of miles from home
In the swirling swimming on
When I'm rolling with the thunder
But bleed from thorns
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

[Verse 1]
I was 16 with a rocket
And some sunshine in my pocket
It was how you used words I didn't know
And the way you said my name
And cut up peaches and them brown eyes
Lit a flame up that we pretend doesn’t glow

[Pre-Chorus]
You know space and time wouldn't let you be mine
What I've come to understand
Is entropy wouldn’t leave you to me
I'm right back where I began

[Chorus]
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, remembering your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm locked up
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love, woohoo

[Post-Chorus]
Stranger, stranger, woohoo
Stranger, stranger, wrapped around your finger
Stranger, stranger, woohoo
Stranger, stranger, woohoo

[Verse 2]
There were times I think about us
Overcome by the nostalgias
I am on call when you need me, let me know
But we're drifting in a strange way
I'm aware that it’s mistake if I love you
It’s a mistake if I don't

[Pre-Chorus]
You know space and time wouldn’t let you be mine
What I've come to understand
Is entropy wouldn't leave you to me
I'm right back where I began

[Chorus]
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it’s love
Holding her closely, remembering your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm locked up
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love, woohoo

[Post-Chorus]
Stranger, stranger, woohoo
Stranger, stranger, wrapped around your finger
Stranger, stranger, woohoo
Stranger, stranger

[Bridge]
And she smelled like Michigan
And it felt like lust
And the nostalgia's killing me
And it's all because, whoa oh

[Chorus]
I'm in the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, remembering your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm locked up
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love, woohoo

[Outro]
Stranger, stranger, holding her closely
Stranger, stranger, and I'm wrapped around your finger
Stranger, stranger
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love, woohoo

[Verse 1]
You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons
If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Verse 2]
Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons
And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Bridge]
Hey, ehh, ehh, eyy
Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay, ehh, ehhy
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one

[Chorus]
When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay
I wish Tracy Chapman was my friend
She would know exactly what to say
Beginnings always hide themselves in ends
At some point I will be okay

So I got high when I met you
I got high to forget you
I feel pain I don't want to
But I have to, yeah, I have to

If I want to move on, move on, move on, move on
If I want to move on, move on, move on, move on
If I want to move on (Move on), move on (Move on), move on (Move on), move on
If I want to move on (Move on), move on (Move on), move on (Move on), move on

Went to see some shaman in Malay
To hear some things I wanted to hear
Everyone just wants to feel good
Everyone just wants to disappear
Call up girls that live in my hometown
To help fill up the minutes
Lit a match and saged my house down
It didn't make a difference
So I got high when I met you
I got high to forget you
I feel pain I don't want to
But I have to, yeah, I have to

If I want to move on, move on, move on, move on
If I want to move on, move on, move on, move on
If I want to move on (Move on), move on (Move on), move on (Move on), move on
I know I got to move on (Move on), move on (Move on), move on (Move on), move on

[Verse 1]
Found myself in the dark
Room all day (all day all day all day)
Hopin' this silence will take this pain away
But no one else is here
To wipe my tears when they fall (oh no)
And no one hears me screamin'
But these four walls

[Hook]
So I'm callin' out your name
Hoping you'd hear me
Got both hands on my heart
Hopin' you'd feel me
Cuz baby I feel you when I close my eyes
Callin' out for you I can't sleep at night

[Chorus]
Can someone help me
Find my angel
Cuz every breath I
Take without is painful
Please someone help me
Find my angel
Cuz I know she hears me callin'
Callin', callin', callin' for my angel
I'm callin' for my angel
Wherever I'll be
Callin', callin', callin' for my angel
I'm callin' for my angel

[Verse 2]
Now, who's gonna pick
Me up when I fell down (down)
You left with a part of me
The air is thining
It's gettin so hard to breathe
(Breathe, breathe) Breathe
I tried to take the pain
Away with this pen
But I found myself writin'
Your name over again
No one can take your place (no)
Life without you is impossible

[Hook]
So I'm callin' out your name
Hoping you'd hear me
Got both hands on my heart
Hopin' you'd feel me
Cuz baby I feel you when I close my eyes
Callin' out for you cuz I need you in my life

[Chorus]
Can someone help me
Find my angel
Cuz every breath I
Take without is painful
Please someone help me
Find my angel
Cuz I know she hears me callin'
Callin', callin', callin' for my angel
I'm callin' for my angel
Wherever I'll be
Callin', callin', callin' for my angel
I'm callin' for my angel

[Bridge]
Yeah hmmm
Just put your hands in the air
If you're missin' somebody
Come home
Cuz I can't handle this alone

[Chorus]
Can someone help me
Find my angel
Cuz every breath I
Take without is painful
Please someone help me
Find my angel
Cuz I know she hears me callin'
Callin', callin', callin' for my angel
I'm callin' for my angel
Wherever I'll be
Callin', callin', callin' for my angel
I'm callin' for my angel

[Verse 1]
It's so intense, the way you work that body
I'm so convinced, make me throw my players card away
I never knew, that just one girl could satisfy
Wake my soul from deep inside
I'm alive, I'm alive

[Hook]
I was like this now, now I'm like that
I was off road now, now I'm on track
Always tryna front, but you're bringin' me back
You're wise enough to start a revolution, in me
A rev-a revolution, in me
I feel there's somethin' movin' I'm me
A rev-a revolution

[Chorus]
You start a revolution
You're the strike of a match
You're the bomb, bomb blowin' me up
A revolution
I can feel your retract takin' on, on, all of your love
A revolution
Cause you turn and you turn
And my world and I just can't stop
The revolution, you start a revolution

[Verse 2]
White flag is up, surrenderin' my all of you
You broke me down
Change me, breakin' all the rules
I never knew one girl, could take control of me
Right down to the soul of me, showin' me, your poetry

[Hook]
I was like this now, now I'm like that
I was off road now, now I'm on track
Always tryna to front, but you're bringin' me back
You're wise enough to start a revolution, in me
A rev-a revolution, in me
I feel there's somethin' movin' I'm me
A rev-a revolution

[Chorus]
You start a revolution
You're the strike of a match
You're the bomb, bomb blowin' me up
A revolution
I can feel your retract takin' on, on, all of your love
A revolution
Cause you turn and you turn
And my world and I just can't stop
The revolution, you start a revolution

[Bridge]
I don't know what, but, she happened to me
Shooting out the sky, like a star onto me
Shooting down my spine, and my skin underneath
She happened to me, happened to me
I don't know what, but, she happened to me
Shooting out the sky, like a star onto me
Shooting down my spine, and my skin underneath
She happened to me, (she)

[Hook]
Start a revolution in me, a rev-a revolution in me
I feel there's something moving, in me
A rev-a revolution

[Chorus]
You start a revolution
You're the strike of a match
You're the bomb, bomb blowin' me up
A revolution
I can feel your retract takin' on, on, all of your love
A revolution
Cause you turn and you turn
And my world and I just can't stop
The revolution, you start a revolution

[Verse 1]
Girl you've been good to me for so long
And I know what I did was wrong
But this time, this time, this time, I'ma change
I won't lie to you no more
I know you heard this song before
But this time,this time, this this time,is not the same

[Hook]
Take a, take a, take a, another chance
I know I don't deserve to have your love ever again
But I need you baby yeahh
How can I make it, make it, make it up to you
Your wish is my command give me your hand and I'll do
Cuz it hurts me when you say

[Chorus]
I sound like a broken record, record, record
A broken record, record, record
All the times I said I was gonna change
I'ma sound like a broken record
A broken record, record, record
Every time I lie, your ears bleed with pain
Form the sounds of a broken record

[Verse 2]
I didn't know what I had till you left
Since you've been gone my life's been a mess
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, I'm too blame
The times you took me back, it got worse
Wish I could take back all the hurt
I'm sorry, sorry, so-sorry, I'm ashamed

[Hook]
Take a, take a, take a, another chance
I know I don't deserve to have your love ever again
But I need you baby yeahh
How can I make it, make it, make it up to you
Your wish is my command give me your hand and I'll do
Cuz it hurts me when you say

[Chorus]
I sound like a broken record, record, record
A broken record, record, record
All the times I said I was gonna change
I'ma sound like a broken record
A broken record, record, record
Every time I lie, your ears bleed with pain
Form the sounds of a broken record

[Verse 1]
With your eyes, with your lips
With your thighs, with your hips
The way you change me
Girl, this might come in handy
Ah, with your smile, with your walk
Girl, I pause when you talk
You make me peaceful
The rest of world may need you

[Hook]
Look how you got me goin'
Time with you is golden
You can save world from foldin', no
Look how you get me higher
You hold the world's desires
For truth and all the liars

[Chorus]
You could change the world
(You could change the)
(You could change the world)
(I could change the world)
You could change the world
(You could change the)
(You could change the world)
(I could change the world)
You could change the world

[Verse 2]
With your words now I see
How the greatness in me
You make me better
Every kiss from you I treasure
If every man had a you
All the wars would be through
They'll get like I get
On the streets they'll be no riot

[Hook]
Look how you got me goin'
Time with you is golden
You can save world from foldin', no
Look how you get me higher
You hold the world's desires
For truth and all the liars

[Chorus]
You could change the world
(You could change the)
(You could change the world)
(Like you changed my world)
You could change the world
(You could change the)
(You could change the world)
(Like you changed my world)
You could change the world

[Verse 1]
It's pourin’ down like rain
Ain't no denying it baby
And now it's started a flame
Oh girl, you got me goin’ insane in a good way
Can't get you off of my brain
Ain't that a shame

[Hook]
If there's just one thing that I gotta do
Is wrap my arms around you
And hold you close and never let you go

[Chorus]
Can I get closer?
Can I get closer?
Can I get closer, closer to you?
Well, can I wipe away your tears?
Wipe away your fears
Be the man that you need me to be
Can I get closer, closer to you?

[Verse 2]
Now baby I've been thinking 'bout us
And I just don't understand
How God can make a woman so beautiful
So perfect, for a man

[Refrain]
Cause when I wake up in the morning and I think about your face
No one in this world could ever take your place
God sent you to me and it's meant to be
Baby, oohh

[Hook]
If there’s just one thing that I gotta do
Is wrap my arms around you
And hold you close and never let you go

[Chorus]
Can I get closer?
Can I get closer?
Can I get closer, closer to you?
Well, can I wipe away your tears?
Wipe away your fears
Be the man that you need me to be
Can I get closer, closer to you?

[Bridge]
And now I’m thinking to myself what is going on
Cause it's to good to be true
But then I remember there’s a God up there sayin'
"Son this ones for you"

[Chorus]
So can I get closer?
Ohh, can I get close to you, baby?
Can I get closer, closer to you? (Closer to you)
(Remember me)
Now can I wipe away your tears
Wipe away your fears
Be the man that you need me to be
Can I get closer, closer to you?

[Outro]
Can I get closer, closer to you?
Mmmm

[Chorus]

Either way baby you know it's temporary fun

She still frequent fender benders now she slender in the butt
Chop it up more baby chop it up

Lyrics from snippet

[Chorus: Post Malone]
...by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

[Verse: Lil Pump]
I got her off a molly, met the bitch at Papi's
Gave her ass a X pill, now she actin' sloppy
I pull up in a Chevy, left off in a Mazi
I can't trust nobody wit' all these bussdowns on me
My chain from Eliantte, cost more than a 'Rari
I got like thirty white bitches in the lobby, I Ubered yo auntie
That bitch really want me, I just wrecked a Bentley
The flexer of the century (Ooh), two bussdowns on one arm (Ooh)
Got the bitch pregnant, 'cause I fucked her raw (Huh)
She just took a line, then she drink some Ciroc (Ciroc)
Got fifty bitches and I'm with Mally Mall (Yeah)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael...

[Skit: Nicki Minaj & Funkmaster Flex]
—Don't gotta do that
And Don Q together
Who’s that?
Yeah, yeah, because they was—they…
Who's that?

[Intro]
Yo, we only doin' this shit once
It get real frightening, you know?
I get real disrespectful when niggas get neglectful of what we do over here
Highbridge stand the fuck up, yeah
Canada!

[Verse]
Uh, live from the DM, I’m hollerin' at your BM
We discussin' which color casket you 'bout to leave in
I did this shit for no reason, I'm lettin' rookies battle
But how did I get in this battle with A Boogie's shadow?
Big Apple, New York City, more to pity
How could I beef with a dude only poppin' in four cities?
I made Forbes with Diddys and sat top floors with 50s
And now I’m fully open, I play the bully on ’em
Call for your squad, your rescue get decimated
You lookin' like a Styles P nephew that never made it
Forever hated on niggas like Boogie and me
’Cause we was poppin' in New York and every hood that you see
The day you beat me will be the day you see see
HOT 97 feedin' you more lovin' than they feed me
Don’t let these niggas gas you on that podcast and CC
Highbridge, the Label, but only one of y'all on TV
Only one of y'all'll see awards and eat with the stars
It ain't really hard to figure out who I'm speakin' up for
Now that my foot and knee in the door, let's talk about it, no walkin' out it
We 'bout to see Le'Quincy body with the chalk around it
I got the full baggage
You drive a Jeep Wrangler, the basic edition, shit ain't even the full package
Someone tell Quincy I turn beef into mince meat
Hottest of the century, why did he go up against me?
I show niggas love and hatred niggas wanna throw back
He tempted me but never had this energy for Kodak
You paid DreamDoll for a feature to get the pussy
And somehow you think you fuckin' with me
The first night I seen DreamDoll I fucked her for free
And now you walk around like somehow you got one up on me
Nigga please, this your brother part
This nigga found Soulja Boy's Gucci headband and wore it in his cover art
Why battle with A Boogie's shadow?
Why battle with A Boogie's shadow?
He ain't even a chapter, he ain't even a factor
QP and Bubba touchin' way more money than him, they ain't even the rappers
It hurts when you kill a nigga you love
Ironic that the salt thrown from the niggas that's slugs
Chewin' these niggas with no ingestion
I got a real message for my brother Quincy, my nigga, it's time to go get tested
It's a couple hoes in Starlets I know you infected
You really out here fuckin' raw with a scrotum infection
And what's worse is you know it, still you go unprotected
You need to focus on a hit, need to go get a record
See you can find a Don Q in the ho nigga section
Go get injected with whatever medicine you need to clear up
'Cause them pills ain't workin' for every time it flare up
Yuck, I'ma let you breathe on that
I'm really beggin' that you think about your physical health
You'll never see your fuckin' album on a physical shelf
I'll beat your ass, whip your kid with the belt
You never flipped it to sell
You're not a hustler, your daddy was a customer
I got the info from your baby mama playin' nympho
You drive a foreign but them 25 hundred dollar hosts ain't enough for you to pay those rentals
You a shameless mental, well my aim is mental, fuck it
My whole mood I showed y'all fuck it
My dick, I done told y'all suck it
I'll punch your fat ass in your stomach
And make everything in it go up it
You wrote a tape for your nigga that died
You made a promise it would pop and that the shit would be live
Hurts that you had to tell my nigga a lie
'Cause that mixtape flopped and so did your other five
Put the gun aside, my nigga, you ain't the one to shoot
Big guns, nigga, you got locked for a .22
Pussy gotta keep a gun on his waist
'Cause you lil' niggas scared to get punched in your face
Jada said it best, Quincy made his bed to rest
Invest in a better vest
Better for my case, these bullets rather hit your head than chest
Quit actin' like you the mob
You tryna play Gianni
But you got ran out of Amazura and Avianne
The Bridge is over, The Bridge is over
I got an extra long clip that'll hit your soldiers
My hand shoot like shampoo hit his head and shoulders
I'll send his nine year old a Barbie just to send condolence
Uh, not the money on the head
40 minutes on stage can put a hundred on his head
I made so much millis and hundreds of this bread
I can have the whole Highbridge comin' for his head
Top floor, Glock's stocked in the top drawer by the 38
Bound to bring Le'Quincy Anderson up to the pearly gates
Your daughter just came from turnin' eight
And takin' L's right in front of her is what you tryna perpetrate?
All this blood make me regurgitate
Don't let my Bronx niggas move and have to boost up the murder rate
But since we're goin' here, I'll let you know I'm here
'Cause this record right here's 'bout to give you more shine than A Boogie ever gave you in your whole career
I spit fire, you from the eastside of the Bronx, you just a Highbridge dick-rider
You mad at my nigga Mula 'cause his shit hotter
I know how it feels
Nah, I'm lyin', I don't know how it feels
I just know that everywhere I go a nigga know I'm s'posed to be real
And I don't know how exposin' me feel, fuck nigga

[Outro]
Just to keep it real, I'm only doin' this shit with you once
You know, I… I hope, I hope you enjoyed this shit though
I hope, I hope you take this as a blessing, you know?
This, this is a lot of pay-per-view time you're gettin' right now
I know you not used to this, you a little frightened
But it's okay, my son, you know I still fuck with you, nigga
And you know, I mean, at least off of this, at least the celebrities might know your name now, you know?
Like… I hope I did that for you
Oh, in other words too, you wild ugly, nigga
Wild fuckin' ugly, nigga
You wild ugly, nigga
Fuck outta here

[Intro: Mehki Raine]
Billie

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Intro]
What if it's not meant for me?
Love...
(Love, love)
(Love, love)
(Love, love)
(Love)

[Verse 1]
I’d like to get to know you
I'd like to take you out
We'd go to the Hell Mary
And afterwards make out
Instead I’m typing you a message
I know I'll never send
Rewriting old excuses
Delete the kiss at the end
When I see you, the whole reduces to just that room
Then I remember and I'm shy and gossip's eye will look too soon
And I'm trapped and overthinking
And probably self-doubt
You tell me "get over it"
And to take you out
But I can't I'm to scared
No, I really have to go
The doors are closing and you were waving
I'll never let it show
And you won’t wait, and I won’t mind
I'm better on my own
Work better on my own, yeah
I work better on my own

[Chorus 1]
What if it’s not meant for me?
What if it's not meant for me?
What if it's not meant for me?
Love...
(Love, love)
(Love, love)
(Love, love)
(Love)

What if it's not meant for me?
What if it’s not meant for me?
What if it's not meant for me?
Love...
(Love, love)
(Love, love)
(Love, love)
(Love)

[Verse 2]
A few days passed since I last saw you
You've taken over my mind
I'm telling all the jokes you told
Pretending that their mine
I wanna tell the whole world about you
And it's a sign
I'm losing self control
It's you, it's you, it's you a thousand times
I got a smile, I got a smile, I'm like a teenage girl
Mights as well write all on my notebook, yeah, you rock my world
You do, you really do
I'm better off with you
I'm better off with you
I'm better off with you

[Chorus 2]
What if it's not meant to be?
What if it's not meant to be?
What if it's not meant to be?
Love...
(Love, love)
(Love, love)
(Love, love)
(Love)

What if it's not meant to be?
What if it's not meant to be?
What if it's not meant to be?
Love...
(Love, love)
(Love, love)
(Love, love)
(Love)

[Bridge]
Tearing my muscles and rolling so hard
Tryna' chase something
Feelings that kill me
No, don't turn me down
No, don't turn me down, no, don't turn me down
No, you know I keep on pushing and pulling at heart strings
Yeah, symphonies, orchestras, screaming, I'm crying so loud
Promised I cried for you like a star
I cried for you like a star
I'd shine for you like a star
Silver and gold in your arms
Yeah, I burn for you in the dark
(Me and you were meant to be...)
You and me were meant to be be
You and me were meant to be be
You and me were meant to be be in love

Love...

That’s my problem, yeah, I got 'em
My tire smokin' when I stop
Okay, nobody fuckin’ with me
My accolades hang from my neck
Pedal, I drown in the heat
My sapphires drown in my sweat
White mags, but I jet

I'm Roger Rabbit in the air
I don't care, Big Willie Style, yeah
Nigga one wheel, one wheel, one wheel
Nigga one wheel, I fishtail downhill, yeah
I rose my rate, brand new brakes
Why I name it Slater? Ask my date

I got rockets on the back
Of my BMX bike
And my heart does wheelies when the
Light hits your pale skin

[Verse 1: Stu Mackenzie]
Cyboogie, a hunk of grey matt
Multitude cells in his metallic dome
Brine fluid floating within
Flows between nodes in his cognisance home
Cyboogie, augmented senses
Scholarship vogue called for celebration
But was it a consciousness can?
Bouncy-ball thoughts in his cerebration

[Verse 2: Stu Mackenzie]
Cyboogie's heart is a mess
Cables in knots in his cavity chest
Cyboogie's feeling depressed
Need to debug and run over the tests
Cyboogie's ticker ain't flesh
Pistons and pumps under graphene lattice
No people to service the mess
When he breaks down in spiritual stress

[Chorus: Stu Mackenzie]

Cyboogie, lump in his throat
Palpitations and nausea ensue
Cyboogie's chorophobia
Terminal error vascular tissue
So Cyboogie's fishing for fishies
Red-bellied trout in a binary brook
How is it that he is depressed?
The humans have pierced through his cheek with a hook

[Chorus: Stu Mackenzie]

You are my everything
You are my everything
You, my everything
Everything, everything, everything

[Verse 1]
It's all because of you, I'm never sad and blue
You've brightened up my days in your own special way
Whenever you're around, I'm never feeling down
You are my trusted friend, on you I can depend
You take me away from the pain and you bring me paradise
And when there were cloudy days you brought sunshine in my life
It never occurred to me the first time I saw your face
I would fall so deep in love that your love can't be replaced

[Chorus]
You are my everything
Love so good only you can bring
You are my everything
You are everything and everything is you

[Verse 2]
My darling only you can make my dreams come true
And every night I pray, you'll never go away
I promise I will try until the day I die
To treat you like a king cause you are my everything
You take me away from the pain and you bring me paradise
And when there were cloudy days you brought sunshine in my life
It never occurred
I would fall so deep in love that your love can't be replaced

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you

When you're lovin' me, put your lovin' arms around me
When you're lovin' me, said I feel so safe, I find security
When you're lovin' me, forever I want you to hold me
My everything, my every, every, every, everything

[Outro]
And I thank you, thank you, thank you

[Verse 1]
Every day I wake and everything is broken
Turnin' off my phone just to get out of bed
Get home every evenin' and history's repeatin'
Turnin' off my phone 'cause it's hurtin' my chest
Hey

[Pre-Chorus]
And Heaven knows I'm not helpless, yeah
But what can I do?
I can't see the use in me cryin'
If I'm not even tryna make the change I wanna see

[Chorus]
I can't sit and hope, I can't just sit and pray that
I can find the love when all I see is pain
Fallin' to my knees, and though I do believe
I can't just preach, baby, preach
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I can't just preach, baby, preach

[Verse 2]
All I hear is voices, everybody's talkin'
Nothin' real is happenin' 'cause nothing is new
Now, when all this tragic, and I just feel sedated
Why do I feel numb? Is that all I can do? Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And Heaven knows I'm not helpless, yeah (Uh)
But I'm only human
I can't see the use in me cryin'
If I'm not even tryna make the change I wanna see

[Chorus]
I can't sit and hope, I can't just sit and pray that
I can find the love when all I see is pain
Fallin' to my knees, and though I do believe (Though I do believe)

I can find the love when all I see is pain
I try to do the things I say that I believe (I do believe)

[Intro]
Please, please
Don't leave﻿ me
Be

[Verse]
It's not true
Take me to the rooftop
Told you not to worry
What do you want from me?
Don't ask questions
Wait a minute
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
Baby, I don't feel so good
And all the good girls go ﻿to Hell
Bite my tongue, bide my time
What is it about them?
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 1]
What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doing nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Better off without them
They're nothing but unstable
Bring ashtrays to the table
And that's about the only thing they share

[Chorus]
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

[Interlude]
Can you check your Uber rating? Oh my god
(And it's like, wait, like, when?)

[Verse 2]
Wakin' up at sundown (Ooh)
They're late to every party (Ooh)
Nobody's ever sorry (Ooh)
Too inebriated now to dance
Morning as they come down (Come down)
Their pretty heads are hurting (Hurting)
They're awfully bad at learning (Learning)
Make the same mistakes, blame circumstance

[Chorus]
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

[Bridge]
Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk
On your cigarette break
I can't afford to love someone
Who isn't dying by mistake in Silver Lake

[Outro]
What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doin' nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Come down
Hurting
Learning

[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

[Bridge]
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

[Outro]
I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad

[Verse 1]
Wait a minute, let me finish
I know you don't care
But can you listen?
I came committed, guess I overdid it
Wore my heart out on a chain
Around my neck, but now it's missin', hmm

[Refrain]
Da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm)
Oh, hmm, hmm

[Chorus]
So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're lookin' at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything?

[Refrain]
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Oh, hmm, hmm

[Verse 2]
You said, "Don't treat me badly"
But you said it so sadly
So I did the best I could
Not thinkin' you would have left me gladly
I know you're not sorry
Why should you be?
'Cause who am I to be in love
When your love never is for me?
Me

[Refrain]
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm)
Oh, hmm, hmm

[Chorus]
So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're lookin' at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything?

[Intro]
No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died
There’s a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do The Scarn

[Verse 1]
Don't ask questions you don't wanna know
Learned my lesson way too long ago
To be talkin’ to you, belladonna
Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma
Take what I want when I wanna
And I want ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Interlude]
I'm really, really sorry, I think I was just relieved
To see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back
Yeah, Michael, the movie is amazing
It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life

[Verse 2]
Deadly fever, please don't ever break
Be my reliever ’cause I don’t self medicate
And it burns like a gin and I like it
Put your lips on my skin and you might ignite it
Hurts, but I know how to hide it, kinda like it (Teh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you’re the fuse
Just add some friction

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Bridge]
Bite my glass, set myself on fire
Can't you tell I'm crass? Can’t you tell I'm wired?
Tell me nothing lasts, like I don't know
You could kiss my— asking about my motto

[Interlude]
You should enter it in festivals or carnivals
Thoughts? Pretty good reaction
Pretty cool... right?

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Outro]
Did you like it? Did you like that?
Um, which part?

[Verse 1]
Told you not to worry
But maybe that's a lie
Honey, what's your hurry?
Won't you stay inside?
Remember not to get too close to stars
They're never gonna give you love like ours

[Chorus]
Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So show me the way home
I can't lose another life

[Refrain]
Hurry, I'm worried

[Verse 2]
The world's a little blurry
Or maybe it's my eyes
The friends I've had to bury
They keep me up at night
Said I couldn't love someone
'Cause I might break
If you're gonna die, not by mistake

[Chorus]
So, where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So tell me you'll come home
Even if it's just a lie

[Bridge]
I tried not to upset you
Let you rescue me the day I met you
I just wanted to protect you
But now I'll never get to

[Refrain]
Hurry, I'm worried

[Outro]
Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
Was hoping you'd come home
I don't care if it's a lie

[Verse]
When you were young and your heart was an open book
You used to say live and let live
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever changing world in which we're living
Makes you give in and cry

[Chorus]
Say live and let die
(Live and let die)
Live and let die, let it die
(Live and let die)

[Bridge]
What does it matter to you?
When you got a job to do
You gotta do it well
You got to give the other fellow hell

[Verse]
You used to say live and let live
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever changing world in which we're living
Makes you give in and cry

[Chorus]
Say live and let die
(Live and let die)
Yeah, live and let die, let it die
(Live and let die)

[Verse 1]
You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons
If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Post-Chorus]
I try to make the worst seem better
All his worn out leather

[Verse 2]
Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons
And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Post-Chorus]
I try to make the worst seem better
All his worn out leather

[Bridge]
Oh, every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one

[Chorus]
When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
Baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Post-Chorus]
I try to make the worst seem better
All his worn out leather
I try to make the worst seem better
All his worn out leather
This can't be true
That the best of our love is way behind
We can find it together
My love for you
Is as strong as the day we fell in love
And we planned for ever

Here I am
In the middle of the night and my need for you
And you're breaking us into

Oh how can you say that it's over (how can you say)
How can you say that it's over (how can you say)
I can't even start to say what's in my heart
Though you many miles away from me
Don't you know you'll always be my love
Yeah

It never ends
All the voices inside that say it's me
And I'm somehow to blame girl
The pain begins
When I think that you're love has gone for good
And it won't be the same, no
Change your mind
Cause I can't change the love I felt from the start
No I just can't change my heart

Oh how can you say that it's over (how can you say)
How can you say that it's over (how can you say)
I can't even start to say what's in my heart
Though you're many miles away from me
Don't you know you'll always be my love

How can you say that it's over (how can you say)
How can you say that it's over (how can you say)
I can't even start to say what's in my heart
Though you're many miles away from me
Don't you know you'll always be my love

Tell me how can you say it's over (how can you say)
How can you say that it's over (how can you say)
I can't even start to say what's in my heart
Though you're many miles away from me
Don't you know you'll always be my love

How can you say, how can you
How can you say, how can you
How can you say, how can you
Say that it's over
How can you say, how can you
How can you say, how can you
How can you say, how can you
Say that it's over
How can you say, how can you
How can you say, how can you
How can you say, how can you
Say that it's over
I can't even start to say what's in my heart
Though you're many miles away from me
Don't you know you'll always be my love

How can you say, how can you
How can you say, how can you
How can you say, how can you
Say that it's over
How can you say, how can you
How can you say, how can you
How can you say, how can you
Say that it's over
You just can't keep on running
You just can't keep on running
Hey!

Like a stranger passing by
You won't settle down for just one guy
Girl, I knew that from the start
There's mixed emotions in your heart

I hear your footsteps in the dark
You just can't keep on running
From the romance that you hide
You just can't keep on running
Keep on running from my love

Watching every move you make
I'll get you girl, you won't escape
Woman, chance after chance, well
You need a sexy gentleman

My heart's 

[?] and then
You just can't keep on running
No, no from the romance that you hide
Don't keep it inside, baby, baby
You just can't keep on running
Running from my love
Runaway child, running wild

Nowhere to run
Love's gonna get you
Did you feel you can run away from love
Nowhere to run
Love's gonna get you
You're only kidding yourself

You can't hide from love
You should know that
There's no need for you to run from mine
Love
You can love a chance
And you will see
That you just can't stop the feeling

You just can't keep on running
You just can't keep on running
Just to keep you in my life
I live each day as if there'll be no more, whoa oh oh
You're my key to paradise
With you the best of love and life's in store, whoa oh oh

Ah, just to keep you in my life means everything to me
Need your lovin' just as much as the very air I breathe, oh
Since I found you I found my heart ain't been the same, no
And what you've found in me I guarantee it will never change

Just to keep you in my life (just to keep you in life)
Just to keep you in my life
Just to keep you in my life

You brought out the best in me
Finally I know what true love means, yeah
You gave life to fantasy
I thought that only lived inside my dreams, whoa oh oh

Ah, you came into my life like shelter from the storm
Your magic keeps my spirits high and your love keeps me warm, yeah
You taught my ups and downs to live in harmony, yeah
Until the twelfth of never my desire will always be
Just to keep you in my life (just to keep you in my life)
Just to keep you in my life
Just to keep you in my life

Just to keep you in my life

And what we share each day put sunshine in my day
Endlessly I pray to god that it never slips away, no
Since I found you I found my heart ain't been the same, no
And what you've found in my I guarantee it will never change

You came into my life like shelter from the storm
Your magic keeps my spirits high and your love keeps me warm, yeah
You taught my ups and downs to live in harmony now
Until the twelfth of never my desire will always be

Just to keep you in my life (it's all I wanna do)
Just to keep you in my life (spend the rest of my life right here with you)
Just to keep you in my life
Just to keep you in my life

Do you remember
When we fell in love
We were so young and innocent then
Do you remember
How it all began
It just seemed like heaven so why did it end?
Do you remember
Back in the fall
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember
Us holding hands
In each other's eyes we'd stare
(Tell me)
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met girl
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
Do you remember
How we used to talk
(Ya know)
We'd stay on the phone at night till dawn
Do you remember
All the things we said like
I love you so I'll never let you go
Do you remember
Back in the Spring
Every morning birds would sing
Do you remember
Those special times
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met girl
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now baby!
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love

You and me in Spain

I'm happy to see you looking healthy
You represent your age
Smile for me
The smile that used to take me places
Make me make some funny faces
Laugh for me
The laugh that makes me feel warm inside
Like cocoa on a cold day
You're the one I wanna love forever
Take my breath away
So won't you be my wife?

A love so true
Won't you be my wife?

I still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
I still feel
I still feel
I still feel like your man
I still feel like
The prettiest girl in the room she wants me
I know because she told me so
She says come over
I'd like to get to know you
But I just don't think I can
'Cause I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
I still keep your shampoo in my shower
In case you wanna wash your hair
And I know that you probably found yourself someone somewhere
But I do not really care
'Cause as long as it is there
I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
Your man
(Ever since the day we met)
(Ever since the day we met)
Still like the letters in your name and how they feel, babe
Still think I'm never gonna find another you
Still like to leave the party early and go home, babe
And don't you know, babe
I'd rather sit here on my own and be alone, babe
'Cause I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
Oh, honey
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
And I don't know why
Still feel like your man
I still feel like
I still feel like
I still feel like
I still
I still
Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
It all just sounds like ooh, ooh ooh hoo hoo
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man
Hey! It's the Temptations!
Come on in...
Man, this one is good...
Move them britches
Move them britches (wait a minute, listen)
Listen, some spirits, are just from down below
Some heathens just can't help themselves, no
Your shifting is unnecessary, evil
In the midst there you are celebrating, my people
Listen, y'all don't wanna think no more
These smart phones
Ya'll just wanna shake your thang
On the dancefloor
Keep moving and groovin', aaaah
Yeah, but dad is coming home
Real soon (real soon) ooooh
Yeah, 'til then you can believe in your false future
Go head and do what you do
Like it or not
It's all getting hot
Fix her another drink on me
Move them britches
Oooh, shake it girl
Move them britches
Come one baby
See it's your world
Move them britches
Oh, wait a minute now, it's that power right there
Move them britches
Yo, y'all sing
Get yo' freak on
That's what you gotta do
Ain't got no worries girl
With new nails and a hairdo
You hope that I'm looking
I am (I am), What?
You know what you're doing
You and your crew
Red rover, red rover
Won't you come over?
As I follow you to the floor
Girl, I think I'm getting sweet on you
Losing my mind, feeling so fine
When I watch you dance
Gimme them thangs
Diamonds can be in your future
I promise there ain't many other kings like me
Or do I nee-e-e-e-e-e-e-d to show you?
But you don't wanna talk
You just wanna play your games
Move them britches
Move them britches

Move them britches

What do you want?
(speaking Klingon)
I don't speak Klingon
(speaking Klingon)
No. Where is the bathroom?
Do you know anyone here?
No, I don't know anyone here.
Are you transporting Tribbles?
No, I'm not transporting Tribbles.
I'm a Terreth! Are you a Klingon?
Yes. What do you want?
(villian!)
(speaking Klingon)
(Well, thanks!)
Excuse me
(spitting noise)
What is your number, Terreth?
My eyes sting. Now I can smell something. Help! Get help quickly!
(crying)
To Terrens, this might seem a tackless way to begin a conversation, but among Klingons, it's considered quite civil.
Stop relaxing!

Uh, black and yellow with that pedal

Took off to another level
Been to war, I got the medals
Different flows, I got several
Different clothes, hopping out expensive doors, never let a nigga pose
If it's alright with you then it's alright with me
If you never try, you never find how real it could be
Got your girls with you, got my niggas with me
Spend it all and get it back, bein' broke's just a memory
Yeah, every time I hit the club with her we be turnin' heads
I put numbers on the board, smell the KK when I board
Private jet when I'm bored, get respect across the board
Get a check when I go, we pull up, bitch, we don't troll

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Said I'm alright (Alright)
Everywhere I go, bitch, I'm alright (Alright)

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 1]
Yeah, started off right
I can see it in your eyes
I can tell that you're wantin' more
What's been on your mind?
There's no reason we should hide
Tell me somethin' I ain't heard before

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it
And it's you I'm on
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts (Yeah)
Can't get what we want without knowin' (No)
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 2]
Oh, nah
Penthouse view, left some flowers in the room
I'll make sure I leave the door unlocked
Now I'm on the way, swear I won't be late
I'll be there by five o'clock

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you've been dreamin' 'bout it
And I'm what you want
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? (Oh) Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before

Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

People ask me if the fame makes me lonely. And I tell them, No, I’m not lonely. Because when I meet my hotel room by myself I can still hear you cheering me there when I close my eyes
When I wrote this album, I wanted to create something full of joy. A celebration, something that took all my mess and all my pain and turned it into the most beautiful schizophrenic psychedelic dance. Full of color, loud electronic music
The most outrageous fashion, something nearly impossible to follow, like my heart, like my mind
Something I couldn’t keep control of
Sometimes we constantly run away from ourselves to keep up with the universe. But with this album I felt free
And if you love ARTPOP then you have no idea how we are so similar
Thank you
So, as much as I enjoy performing this show, laughs Are you saying something?
*gets on her knees* Hello! Oh, my hair! *gets up*
I enjoy performing this show for you every night and I hope that you loved it
Everybody watching on Yahoo, we love you. Everybody here in Paris, we love you
But I’d wish to tell you something. I know we’ve put up a show, and, I have the most amazing dancers, the most amazing band, the most incredible crew. Thank you from the bottom of my heart to the entire crew for this whole tour, I lcve you so much. But, the real show

The real show every night is the one in the audience. You are so full of passion, so full of freedom
So please, my sweet little monsters, in the most non-traditional of request, I the performer, ask you to accept our deepest applause *smiles*

[Intro]
You were spectacular! A masterpiece Paris! I couldn’t take my eyes of you for a second!
An absolute sensation across the talent! Put your hands up make ‘em touch!

[Verse 1]
I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong!
To crash the critic saying, "is it right or is it wrong?"
If only fame had an IV
Bcby, could I bear being away from you
I found the vein, put it in here

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

[Chorus]
NOW MOVE IT JUMP!
Give me that thing that I lcve
Put your hands up, make 'em touch
Give me that thing that I lcve
Put your hands up, make 'em touch

[Post-Chorus]
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch

[Verse 2]
I've overheard your theory "Nostalgia's for geeks" *walk and make move voice*
I guess sir, if you say so
Some of us just like to read!
One second I'm a kunst, then suddenly the kunst is me
Pop culture was in art, now art’s in pop culture, in me

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way you cheer and SCREAM FOR ME!
LETS GO CMON !

[Chorus]
Give me that thing that I lcve
Put your hands up, make 'em touch !
Give me that thing that I lcve
Put your hands up, make 'em touch!
CMON WOO !

[Bridge]

Some little piggies went to artrave
And the little piggies stayed home
Do me a favour, you beautiful generation. Don’t be so hard on yourself
If you wanna get to where I am today, if you have dreams of being a star, don’t worry about being beautiful, don’t worry about being on YouTube, or Twitter
You rely on your f* talent to get you to the top
Hard work, discipline, passion. And all the little piggies in here will go Wi, wi - Wi, wi
Wi, wi SWINEEE!!
COME ON! LET’S DANCE! JUMP! JUMP!

[Verse 1]
Hush up
Don't speak, don't wanna hear another
You're just an animal, trying to act real special !

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
'Cause it's when I'm not thinking with you that I act like a swine
Act like a swine!
Act like a swine!

[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Hands up !
Do ya? I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body!
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside!
LET’S GO PARIS!
Swine-ah-ya-ih-ih-ih!
Swine-ah-ya-ih-ih-ih!

*plays piano*
I hope that you always remember this time in our lives together
When we painted each others faces, and called each other monsters. And talked about love, and art, all night long
Every year, when I travel around the world, I always wonder if things will be different. Maybe one year you won’t come to the show. Or you’ll be less festive or, not dressed up or, something different
But what I realised, during ARTPOP, is that we belong together and some stories have no end
I will follow you, around the world, as long as you have me
Because I love making music, I love making art. And I love, love meeting all of you beautiful creative people
When this song is over, the clock will start ticking, until… the next time

[Verse 1]
Sometimes a story has no end
Sometimes I think that we could just be friends..
"'Cause I'm a wandering man," he said to me
"And what about the future plans?
Does this thing we have even makes sense?
When I got the whole world in front of me?"

I appreciate you so much. Thank you for believing in, in me always. I’ll always believe in you
When I die, they’ll say: “Lady Gaga was special. But her fans, her monsters, they were really something.”

[Chorus 1]
So, I said...
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gcpsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever
Taylor, im coming home! *smile*
But I can be..
COME ON!!
Tonight!
Tonight!

[Verse 2]
PUT YOUR HANDS UP !
So I just packed my baggage, and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took a road to nowhere on my own
Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home!

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, But I can be WITH PARIS TONIIIIIIGHT!!!


Put your hands up for DJ White Shadow, DJ Zedd, and Red One
And we can't forget Billy, and all of you ! I lcve you so much! *claps*

[Bridge]
And then he asked me, he said
"Baby, why do we love each other?"
I said, "Honey, it's simple !
It's the way that you love and treat your mother."

[Chorus 2]
Thought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home, but I think with you, I could spend my life
And you'll be my little gcpsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rearview and PARIS
'Cause it's you and me
EVERYBODY ALL TOGETHER COME ON!! *sings* BABY FOR LIFEEE!!!!

[Hook]
'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gcpsy, gcpsy, gcpsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gcpsy, gcpsy, gcpsy, I'm

[Outro]
Russia, UK, Paris
I'm Italian, Asian kompai
Africa, India, I'm a gcpsy, gcpsy, gcpsy
I'm Latin-American
I don't speak German, but I try
Someday in Jakarta
I'm American, I'm gcpsy
I'm Bangkok, Australian, Malaysia
Sweden, Finland, Norway
Be my home just for the day
I'm a gcpsy, gcpsy, gcpsy
Hey...

Thank you so much! We love you
May the clock start ticking, monsters, till next time *smiles*

EarlOnTheBeat

[Verse 1]
Lately, I been chillin', I been too lazy
They want me to jump in the crowd, but I can’t
My earrings too brazy
For that sack, lil' baby, she go too brazy, ayy
Cameras on us, run out, keep it cool baby
I'ma fuck her for fourteen minutes then dip
Walkin’ through the Galleria up in Houston like Lil Flip, ooh
Glock up on my hip, I cannot slip
Havin' threesomes with my Brooklyn bitch, she crip

[Chorus]
Hit my lean then dip
Lean then dip
Dip (Dip, dip), lean then dip
Dip (Dip, dip), lean then dip
Dip (Dip, dip), lean then dip-ip-ip
Dip

[Verse 2]
Off the rip
I just want her lip, rocketship
Sax drone, drunk pop, keep a trombone
Flip a nigga like a Tracfone if he act wrong
Please don't do that doe
Buddy in the back gotta move that dough
Keep them dirty birds like Julio
Real Slimeball like Nudy, bro
Bitch bent over on the back of the boat
Ribs, I'm in her ribs
She gon' eat this dick up like some chips

[Chorus]
Hit my lean then dip
Lean then dip
Dip (Dip, dip), lean then dip
Dip (Dip, dip), lean then dip
Dip (Dip, dip), lean then dip-ip-ip
Dip

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I don’t like my mind right now
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
Wish that I could slow things down
I wanna let go but there’s comfort in the panic

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me
Yeah, I drive myself crazy
'Cause I can’t escape the gravity

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Kiiara]
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?

[Post-Chorus]
(Holding, holding, holding, holding
Holding, holding, holding, holding)

[Verse 2: Kiiara]
You say that I'm paranoid
But I’m pretty sure the world is out to get me
It’s not like I make the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
I know I'm not the centre of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the centre of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same

[Chorus: Kiiara]
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?

[Post-Chorus: Kiiara]
(Holding, holding, holding, holding
Holding, holding, holding, holding)
Holding on (Holding, holding)
Holding on (Holding, holding)

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & Kiiara]
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same

[Pre-Chorus: Kiiara]
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything’s about me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Kiiara]
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on, why is everything so heavy?

[Outro]
Why is everything so heavy?

[Verse 1]
Let's take our time tonight, girl
Above us, all the stars are watchin’
There's no place I'd rather be in this world
Your eyes are where I’m lost in

[Pre-Chorus]
Underneath the chandelier, we're dancin' all alone
There's no reason to hide what we're feelin' inside right now

[Chorus]
So, baby, let's just turn down the lights and close the door
Ooh, I love that dress but you won't need it anymore
No, you won’t need it no more
Let’s just kiss 'til we’re naked, baby
Versace on the floor
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Versace on the floor
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl

[Verse 2]
I unzip the back to watch it fall
While I kiss your neck and shoulders
No, don't be afraid to show it all
I'll be right here ready to hold ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know you're perfect from your head down to your heels
Don’t be confused by my smile, 'cause I ain't ever been more for real, for real

[Chorus]
So, just turn down the lights and close the door
Ooh, I love that dress but you won't need it anymore
No, you won't need it no more
Let's just kiss 'til we're naked, baby
Versace on the floor
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Versace on the floor
Oh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
It's warmin' up, can you feel it?
It's warmin' up, can you feel it?
It's warmin' up, can you feel it, baby?
Oh, seems like you're ready for more, more, more
Let's just kiss 'til we're naked

[Outro]
Oh, Versace on the floor, oh oh
Take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Versace on the floor, ooh baby
Take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Versace on the floor

[Intro]
Patty, I see you too
This what y'all be wanting?
This what they waiting for?
Okay, haha, rrrr

[Verse]
Neck tat say “Onika”
I got more slaps than Aretha
When you lose the Queen, niggas friendly, dawg
It was just back to back like Wembley, dawg
Now you all the way back up in the Bentley, dawg
I turn lemons into lemonade simply, dawg
Old boy and my brother tried to end me, dawg
I heard they looking for the old me
A couple of you niggas still owe me
You asked for the G.O.A.T. so they sent me, sleeze
Tryna lay low, don't tempt me, sleeze
Thirty in the clip will be empty, sleeze
You bitches still my sons, learn your As and Bs
Leave the hate train in the station please
I was in the court, no Jays and Beys
Made her change her mind in the judge chamber, sleeze
The MAC's on the line, I ain't talking 'bout the PC
I'm the biggest fish in the pan, I'll do you greasy
All he gotta do is call, I'm in my T-shirt and my drawers
Face down, ass up, I'm already on all fours
Suck his dick through his shorts
Then I ride him like a whore
I mean a horse, I'm a boss
Yeah, I got the juice and I'm takin' him on a tour
Imitating Nicki while your ghostwriter dissin' me
Leave for two weeks, I got all of my babies missin' me
Never gon' fall, never not gon' ball
And I keep my nigga bustin' like a draco
He always come back, Big Draco
Still going bad on you stank hoes

[Outro]
Uh, haha mmm
Ahahaha, ahahaha!
O-kaaaaaay
They wanted the old Nicki
They wanted the old Onika, so
I had to, uh, get back in my bag
I might drop a freestyle every, um, week 'til the thing-thing come
The label hit me said they want the fifth thing-thing, I got in the studio, I did the fifth thing-thing
And then they say "You know, it's time to drop your single" I said "Noooo"
You know radio already tried to blackball a bitch
It's all good 'cause when you a legend, when you legendary
You shine no matter what
They get compared to me no matter what
They asked for the GOAT so I came through, bitch
But look, on some real shit, I'm 'bout to go on tour with, um, Juice WRLD
In Europe, shout-out to my fans in Europe
Uhm, I'm fucking three to four times a day, I'm feeling real good
I'm rehearsing for the tour
You know I'm sayin', pussy feelin' real good right now
Pussy like bald, like really bald right now

I'm just playing around and having some fun
Zamn Zaddy, eoooow!

[Intro]
Run that back, Turbo

[Verse 1]
I just got 10 million bucks for shit that I ain't even do yet
You spent your money but I ain't say I was your boo yet
You got your feelings hurt, I ain't really mean to do that
I'm just a bad bitch, I'm sorry I put you through that
I'm from New York where we’ll never say, "Good morning"
Rippin' the block and he ain't come home 'til the morning
I always prayed to have a building with a doorman
Now I'm so busy I gotta turn down these endorsements
Now I'm flauntin' everything that I wanted
Remember a time when I couldn't even afford it
Now I'm in stores, I get everything that fits me
Chanel mink slides and shades so they don't know it's me

[Chorus]
Drip too hard, got his dick too hard
He gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Pretty little toes, stunting on these hoes
Buy another bag soon as I get paid
Bad little vibe, keep her by my side
'Case a dirty bitch gotta catch this fade
Do it all the time, still I'm in my prime
Couple new blessings every time we pray

[Verse 2]
Uh, I'm still the same bitch from the city of the potholes
She say, "Oh, I got those," I said, "No, it's not those"
I don't fuck with birds, but you bitches on my cock though
If I want some chicken and waffles I go to Roscoe's
Cooler than the winter but I heat up like the summer
Fuckin' with my baby, I'm a gunna
When I say baby, I ain't talkin' 'bout Stunna
I'm talking 'bout lil' like Weezy on the come-up (Uh)

[Chorus]
Drip too hard, got his dick too hard
He gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Pretty little toes, stunting on these hoes
Buy another bag soon as I get paid
Bad little vibe, keep her by my side
'Case a dirty bitch gotta catch this fade
Do it all the time, still I'm in my prime
Couple new blessings every time we pray
Drip too hard, got his dick too hard
He gon' fuck around and drown
Pretty little toes, stunting on these hoes
Buy another bag
Bad little vibe, keep her by my side
'Case a dirty bitch gotta catch this fade
Do it all the time, still I'm in my prime
Couple new blessings every time we pray (Yeah)
(And we pray)

[Outro]
Couple new blessings every time we pray
Every time we pray
Couple new blessings every time we pray

[Verse]
Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated
For every tyrant, a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul, the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer, a dream, we're unstoppable
With something to believe in

[Chorus]
Monday left me broken
Tuesday, I was through with hopin'
Wednesday, my empty arms were open
Thursday, waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love to come around

[Post-Chorus]
Come around, come around
Come around, come around

"Freaks gonna bob to that," Kirk said it
People think I'm still fly, I read it
In the Oakland Tribune
They said I dance like I ain't gonna retire soon
Well 'til I die and go and live in my heavenly mansion
I keep the rock-n-rolling in a funky fashion
Speaking of which, my rags are game
When I see the maker, He asks my tailor's name
Yeah, I got a gift
Nothing's gonna make me lose it
Sadomasochist this groove
And now you gotta use it

[Chorus]
Freaks gonna bob to this
Sadomasochist this groove

While your CD thinkin' to come out, I be creeping
Talkin' to the foreigners
(Freak freak)

The charts don't mean a damn when you free

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around
Coming around, coming around, in a circle
Coming, coming, coming around
Coming around, coming around, in a circle

[Verse 2]
Escaping through the lily fields, I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to never ever land

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around
Coming around, coming around, in a circle
Coming, coming, coming around
Coming around, coming around, in a circle

[Verse 1]
I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Well, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Chorus 1]
I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Well, the sheriff couldn't catch me
But his little girl sure wished she would

[Verse 2]
Doctor call me crazy, some says I am some says I ain't
Doctor call me crazy, some says I am some says I ain't
The preacher man call me a sinner
But his little girl call me a saint

[Chorus 2]
Couple of shots of whiskey, women round here start lookin' good
A couple of shots of whiskey, women round here start lookin' good
Couple more shots of whiskey
I'm goin' down to Minglewood
T for Texas, yes and it's T for Timbuctoo
T for Texas, yes and it's T for Timbuctoo
Yes and it's T for 

[insert city]
Where the little girls know what to do
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds; silver beads pass into the sea

She comes from a town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
And she bears it away with a love that the river has taught her
Let it flow, greatly flow, wide and clear

Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring; black dirt live again

The plowman is broad as the back of the land he is sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his day measures more than the planting and growing
Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield

[Chorus]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout
I am, I am, I am, I am
So it goes, we make what we made since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, work of men
Seasons round, creatures great and small, up and down, as we rise and fall

[Chorus]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout
I am, I am, I am, I am
Your long hair – a short walk
My biggest fear and a slow watch
In the thin air my ribs creak
Like wooden dining chairs when you see me
Always scared that every situation ends the same
With a blank stare
Me and the tap water circling the sink drain
Because it's heavy
But I’m trying really hard to keep my nose clean
And the blue out of my arms
But it's not easy

It's not easy when what you think of me is important
And I know it shouldn’t be so damn important
But it is to me
And I'm only ever screaming at myself in public
I know I shouldn't act this way in public
I know I shouldn't make my friends all worry
When I go out at night
And grind my teeth like sutures
My mouth like a wound
When I stay up and throw my voice about you
Or less about you
And more about how I ruin everything I think could be good news

[Intro]
Thank you
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
I wonder if you would believe if I said

[Verse 1]
If I lose this dream, I don't know what I’m gonna do
If I lose this dream (This dream) I'm dreaming about for me and you

[Bridge]
If it goes away, I might as well hang it up, 'cause I don’t know
If I have the heart or mind to make it true, to help it grow
And I only know, I only know, I only know

[Verse 2]
If I lose this dream (This dream!), it's goodbye, love and happiness
You're the one I need - I don't want a love that's second-best

[Bridge]
There been things all of my life I wanted to do that made me blue
Help me hold onto this dream, for sometimes, dreams often come true
And they'll come true, they'll come true, for me and for you, hey
(Wait a minute, baby)

[Chorus]
Don't let me lose this dream
Baby, baby, hold on
Don’t let me lose my dream
Baby, baby, be strong

[Outro]
You say that-a you believe that what I say is true (Hey, hey, hey)
And that I’m the one and only girl for you (Wait a minute, baby)
And no matter what the people say (Hey, hey, hey)
You're in my corner all the way
And I won’t lose this dream
Baby, baby, hold on
Don't let me lose my dream
Baby, baby, be strong
Don't let me... ooh, baby
Baby, baby, hold on, oh

[Intro]
Only you can hear my soul serenade

[Verse]
I want to be free to fly away and sing to the world
About my soul serenade!
Sing about my soul serenade, yeah

[Bridge]
When you're not around, there's a lonely sound
In my soul serenade, yeah
In my soul serenade, yeah, mhm

[Outro]
Everyone but you adores me
But can I tell you that pretty soon they bore me, yes they do
Can I tell you right now that they bore me, ah yeah
They bore me with those pretty little words
Those pretty little words of devotion, yeah
But, oh, let me leave 'em waiting this evening
That they can jump in anybody's ocean, yeah
Because only you hear my soul, hear my soul serenade
I'm talking about my serenade, yeah, yes it is
This is my soul serenade
I'm singing about my serenade, yeah yeah
I'm talking about my serenade, yeah
My soul serenade, yeah
My soul serenade, yeah

Oh, listen to the blues, to the blues and what they’re playing
I wonder tonight, are you really listening to the blues
To the blues and what they’re saying
What they seem to be playing to me that’s, that many people have loved
And they seem to be saying to me that many people have lost
Well, listen, they might not have loved at all
If they had know that they couldn’t pay the cost

[Outro]
Oh, they tell me, yeah, they tell me, yeah, they tell me, yeah, they tell me
They tell me that life is just an empty scene
They say that is older than the oldest broken hearts
And they tell me that is newer than the newest stood dreams
Well, the night life, what I’m doin’ right now ain’t no good life
But that’s alright with me, because it’s my life, yes it is
Ooh, I tell you that the night life sure ain’t no good life

Groovin’
On a Sunday afternoon (Sunday, Sunday)
Oh, really, baby
Couldn't get away too soon (Too soon)

[Verse 1]
I can't imagine anything that’s better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There ain't no place I'd like to be
Instead of groovin'
Down a crowded avenue, yeah
Oh, really, baby, really
Anything we like to do

[Bridge]
Always lots of things that we could see
Could be anyone that we wanna be
And all those happy people, we could be just

[Chorus]
Groovin'
On a Sunday afternoon, ah yeah

[Interlude]
I'm crazy about my band
And I’m just wondering whether you’re enjoying this band as much as I
Are you really? Are you?

[Verse 2]
We'll keep on spending sunny days this way
With all the talking and all my time away
I feel it coming closer day by day
Life would be ecstasy, you and me here hopefully

[Chorus]
Groovin’, yeah
On a Sunday afternoon, yeah
Oh, really, really baby
I couldn't get away too soon

[Outro]
Darlin', you send me
Send me groovin', yeah

Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired

[Pre-Chorus]
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
But you're the key to my peace of mind

[Chorus]
Because you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman

[Verse 2]
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along, to claim it
Well, I didn’t know, I didn't know what was wrong with me
Until your kiss helped me name it

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I’m living for
And if I make you happy, I really don't need to do more

[Chorus]
Because you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (Woman)

[Bridge]
Oh, baby, what you done to me? (What you done to me)
You make me feel so good inside (Good inside)
And I, and I just wanna be (Wanna be)
I wanna get next to you, you make me feel so, so alive

[Outro]
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
You really, really make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (Woman)
Do you believe you make me feel
You really, really make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman

[Chorus]
Come back, baby (Come back, baby)
Baby, please don't go (Come back, baby)
'Cause the way I love you (You wouldn't believe it)

I don't want nobody
Always sittin' around me and my man
I tell you that I don't won't nobody
Always sittin' right there looking at me and that man
Be it my mother, my father, my brother or my sister
Would you believe I get up, put on some clothes

I tell you, girls, I dig you, but I don't have time
To sit, and sit, and just sit and chit chat and smile

[Verse 3]
Now, don't send me no doctor
Filling me up with all of those pills
I got me a man named Dr. Feelgood, yeah
And oh, yeah, oh, oh
That man takes care of all of my pains and my ills
His name is Dr. Feelgood, feel good in the morning
And taking care of business
Is really this man's game
And after one visit to Dr. Feelgood
You'd understand why Feelgood is his name
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Good God Almighty, that man sure makes me feel real good, yeah

[Outro]
Thank you, thank you
Ah, I see you got your Dr. Feelgoods out there with you tonight, girls
Alright

[Verse 1]
Baby baby, sweet baby
There's something that I just got to say
Baby baby, sweet baby
You left me hurtin' in a real cold way
Speak your name
And I'll feel a thrill
You said I do
And I said I will

[Pre-Chorus]
I told you that I'll stay true
And give you just a little time
Wait on me, baby
I want you to be all mine
I have been so blue

[Chorus]
Since you've been gone, ah baby
(Why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)
Since you've been gone, yeah
(Why'd you do it?) Yeah (Why'd you have to do it?)

[Verse 2]
Baby baby, sweet baby
I didn't mean to run you away
It was pride on my lips
But not in my heart
To say the things that made you stray
But ah, baby
Hey hey, hear me, hear me now
(Hear me)
I don't know what I'm gonna do
(Hear me)
Yeah, to get you back somehow
(Hear me now)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm trying
Take me back
Consider me please
If you walk in that door
I can get up off my knees
But I've just been so blue

[Chorus]
Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? Why'd you have to do it?)
Hey baby, since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? Why'd you have to do it?)

[Outro]
Yeah now, I've been so lonely
(Sweet sweet - sweet sweet baby)
Baby, since you've been gone
(Sweet sweet - sweet sweet baby)
Yeah now, and I've been so lonely
(Why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)
Hey baby, since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)
Yeah, baby baby baby baby baby, sweet sweet baby
Since you've been gone, yeah now
(Sweet sweet - sweet sweet baby)
Baby baby baby baby baby baby, sweet sweet baby
Since you've been gone, yeah

[Verse 1]
You're a no good heartbreaker
You're a liar and you're a cheat
And I don't know why
I let you do these things to me
My friends keep telling me
They tell me that you ain't no good
But oh, they don't know
That I'd leave you if I could

[Chorus]
Well, I guess I'm uptight
And I'm stuck like glue
Because I ain't never (Never)
I tell you I ain't never (Never)
I ain't (Never)
Never, no, no
Loved a man, the way that I, I love you

[Verse 2]
Some time ago I thought
That you had run out of fools
But I was so wrong, so wrong, so wrong
You got one that you'll never lose
The way he treats me is a shame
How could he do me so bad
When baby baby, I'm the sweetest thing
That you ever had, yeah

[Chorus]
Kiss me once again
Don't you never, never say that we're through
(Never) I tell you I ain't never
(Never) I ain't
(Never) Never, no, no
Loved a man, the way that I, I love you

[Bridge]
I can't sleep at night
And I can't...
I guess I'll never be free
Since you got, your hooks, in me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
I ain't never loved a man before
Ain't never loved one the way I do this one, no no
And I wanna leave it right here with you in Paris tonight
I ain't never had one man do me as bad
Not as quite as bad as this one, no no, but that's alright
What I'm gonna do is hold him
Yeah, I'm gon' hold on to him now
Oh, hold
Yeah, hold on to him now, because I...
Thank you very much

Good evening
Hi, hello
In the beginning, we're gonna ask you to do just one thing, alright?
And it's just to relax, go in your soul just for a few minutes
I promise you gon' get it back
Gonna do a little this, some of that
And more or less, just feel good
I can say let it all hang out, every last bit of it
I promise you when you leave here
You will have enjoyed this show as much as any that you've ever had the pleasure to see, alright?

[Intro]
A little something that we're experimenting with tonight
So we hope you enjoy it as much as we're going to enjoy doing it

[Verse 1]
Tell me how can you get through
When you can't remember who you're talking to
Your concentration is just slippin' away
Because your baby is so far away

[Chorus]
And the rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love
Why don't you love the one you're with
Why don't you love the one you're with
(Yeah, it's alright, ain't it?)

[Verse 2]
Don’t be angry (Don’t be)
Baby, don’t be sad (Don’t be)
Don’t sit back top thinking about some goods that you had
There’s a boy sitting next to you
Why don’t you check him out, see what he wants to get into

[Chorus]
There’s a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can’t be with the one that you love
Why don’t you love the one you’re with
Love the one you’re with
Yeah, it’s alright, ain't it? Ha ha

[Bridge]
Dah-dah
Dah-dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah-dah
Dah-dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah, dah-dah-dah, hey

Love the one you’re with
Love the one, love the one you’re with
Love the one

[Verse 3]
Don’t be angry (Don’t be)
Don’t be sad (Don’t be)
Don’t sit back fooling about some good times you had
Because there’s a boy, standing right next to you
And you don’t know what he wants to get into
Check him out

[Chorus]
There’s a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can’t be with the one you love
Why don’t you love the one you’re with
Love the one you’re with
Love the one you’re with, yeah
Love the one you’re with, mmm

[Outro]
You ought to love
The one you’re with (Why don’t you)
You ought to love (Why don’t you)
The one that you’re with (Why don’t you)
Why don’t you love (Why don’t you)
The one you’re with (Why don’t you)
You ought to love (Why don’t you)
The one you’re with (Why don’t you)
Ooh

The one you’re with (Why don’t you)
Why don’t you love (Why don’t you)
The one that you’re with (Why don’t you)
You ought to love (Why don’t you)
Love the one you’re with (Why don’t you)
Tell me why don’t you (Why don’t you)
Love the one you’re with (Why don’t you)

Dah-dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah, dah-dah-dah
Thank you for making me feel real good

[Intro]
(Don’t trouble the water) Don't trouble the water
(Give it up, why don’t you, why don’t you let it be?)
Mmm-hmm, 'cause (Still waters run deep)
Still waters run deep, yes they do (Oh, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
When you’re down now
When you look up and see yourself on the street
When evening falls (When evening falls)
Somehow (Somehow), I'll be there to comfort you
I’ll take the bow, I'll take it when darkness falls
When that is all, is all around

[Chorus]
Just like a bridge over troubled water, I'll be there to lay me down
(Like a bridge) Just like a bridge
(Over troubled water) Over troubled and stormy waters
I'll be there to lay me down
(Oh, I lay me down, oh, I lay me down)
Yes He will, yes He will

[Verse 2]
Sail on silver moon, sail on by
Your time has come to shine, all of your dreams are on their way
(See how they shine) See how they, see how they shine
Oh, if you ever need a friend (Need a friend)
If you ever do, look around and sailing by, sailing right behind

[Chorus]
(Like a bridge) Just like a bridge
(Over troubled water) Like a bridge over troubled water
I swear I’ll be there, I'll be there to lay me down
(Like a bridge) Like a bridge
(Over troubled water) Over troubled water
I'm gon' be there, gon' be there to lay me down
(Oh, I lay me down, oh, I lay me down)
Oh, yes I will (Don't trouble the waters)

[Outro]
Don't trouble the waters
(Leave it alone) Leave it alone
(Why don’t you, why don’t you let it be?)
Why don't you let it be because...
(Still waters run deep) Still waters run so deep
(Oh, yeah, yeah)
Yes it do (Woo)

[Intro]
Don't fight the feelin'

[Verse 1]
I'm Eleanor Rigby
I picked up the rice in the church where the weddings have been
Yeah, I'm Eleanor Rigby
I'm keepin' my face in a jar by the door
If you wanna know what is it for, Well

[Chorus]
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from
All the lonely people
Where do they, where do they all belong

[Verse 2]
Father McKenzie
Writing the words to a sermon
That no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Knotting his socks in the night
What does he care

[Chorus]
Talkin' about all, all the lonely people
Where do, where do they all come from
All over this world, the lonely people
Tell me where, where do they all belong

[Bridge]
Eleanor, Eleanor Rigby
Eleanor, Eleanor Rigby

[Verse 3]
Eleanor Rigby died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie Wiping the dirt from his hands
As he walks from the grave

[Chorus]
Sayin' all, all of the lonely people
Where do they all come from
All over this world, the lonely lonely people
Tell me where, where do they all belong

[Outro]
Eleanor, Eleanor Rigby
Could it be, could it be Eleanor Rigby
Come on girl, do your thing, yeah yeah
Eleanor Rigby, Eleanor, woo
Eleanor Rigby, baby, do your thing

[Intro]
If you came and didn't come with anybody
Perhaps you might want to turn around and say to the next person

[Verse 1]
Hey, have you ever tried
Really reaching out for the other side
I may be climbing on a rainbow
But baby, here goes (Baby, here goes)

[Chorus]
Dreams are for those who sleep
Life, life is for us to keep
And if I had just one to see me through
Hey baby, I want to make it with you
(I really think that we could make it)
Yes I do (Make it, baby)
(I really think that we could make it)
I sure do (Make it, baby)

[Verse 2]
No, no, you don't know me well
Listen baby, in every little thing only time will tell
And if you do the things that I do
I'm gon' try my best to see you through (Make it through)
Yeah

[Chorus]
Life, life is for us to keep
Dreams are for those who sleep
And if I had just one to see me through, woo-hoo
I wanna make it with you
(I really think that we could make it)
Yes I do (Make it, baby)

And if I had just one, just one
Just one little thing to do

But I've got to make it with you

[Intro]
Does anybody feel like hearing the blues?
Alright

[Verse 1]
I don't want nobody
Always sittin' around me and my man
Is that right, girls? Anybody?
I tell you that I don't need nobody
Not always sittin' right there looking at me and that man
Now, be it my mother, my brother, my father or my sister
Would you believe I get up, put on some clothes
Go out and help them find somebody for their self if I can
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Now, I don't mind company
I don't mind company, because company's alright with me
Every once in a while
Don't get me wrong, people
I really love company
Because company is alright with me
Every once in a great while
But, oh, ooh, oh, oh, ooh, oh
When me and that man get to lovin'
I love you, girls, but I don't have no time
To sit with you, and sit with you
And sit, and sit and chit chat and smile

[Outro]
Don't send me no doctor
Filling me up with all of those pills
'Cause I got me a man named Dr. Feelgood, yeah
Oh, oh, oh yeah
That man takes care of all of my pains and ills
Calling Dr. Feelgood
Because taking care of business
Is surely truly this man's game
Hello, mister
And after one visit to Dr. Feelgood
You'd understand why Feelgood is his name
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Good God Almighty, that man sure makes me feel real good

About things I don't understand sometimes
Sometimes it's good
Oh, hear me now, it's good
Just sit there, cross your arms
Cross your legs, look on up to Heaven and say yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
People now, can I hear you say 'yeah'
If you understand some of what I mean, can I hear you say 'yeah'

Listen, wait a minute, hold it
Listen to this, can you feel the spirit?
Wait a minute, can you feel the spirit?
When you hear Aretha sing y'all, oh Lord
Can you feel the spirit?
When my woman wake me up in the mornin'
She give me the spirit, ha
Oh, when I'm on my last go round
I need a little spirit
It's good for my soul, oh yes it is
Every night and day, oh Lord

Oh, Aretha, haha, can you feel the spirit, girl?
Yes I can, you know I can
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Ahhh, woo!

Lord, don't hold me off
'Cause I feel the spirit
I got to find me a woman tonight
'Cause I feel the spirit
It's gettin' next to me now
Oh my...
Ray Charles...
What can you say about Ray Charles, except he's the Right Reverend, ain't he?
He's the sho'nuff Right Reverend

[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen, right
I would like to say before we leave that
You have been much more than I could have ever expected
I'd like to leave you saying

[Chorus]
Reach out and touch
Somebody's hand
Make this a better world
If you can
We love you, reach out and touch
Somebody's hand
Why don't you make it a better world
If you can

[Outro]
Turn around and touch your brother, touch your sister
Reach out and touch, extend your hand
Somebody's hand
Make this a better world
If you can
Reach out and touch
Somebody's hand
Make it a better world
If you can
Need I say more, need I say more? No
Reach out and touch, reach out and touch
Your brother's hand
Go on and make it a better world
I beg you, if you can

I love you, I love you, and I love you
Call me the moment you get back
I love you

Reach out and touch, yeah yeah yeah
Reach out for your brother's hand
Woo, woo, woo woo woo woo
Reach out and touch, reach out...
You've come to tell me something you say I ought to know
That he don't love me any more, and I'll have to let him go
Now you say you're gonna take him, oh but I don't think you can
'Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man

Women like you, they come a dime a dozen
You can buy them anywhere
For you to get to him, I'd have to move over
And I'm gonna stand right here
But it'll be over my dead body, so get out while you can
'Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man

Sometimes a man's caught looking at things that he don't need
He took a second look at you, but he's in love with me
Now I don't know where that leave's you, ah but I know where I stand
And you ain't woman enough to take my man

Women like you, they come a dime a dozen
You can buy them anywhere
For you to get to him, I'd have to move over
And I'm gonna stand right here
Well it'll be over my dead body, so get out while you can
'Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man
No you ain't woman enough to take my man
I can't get no, satisfaction. I can’t get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try, I can't get no, I can’t get no

When I'm driving in my car and that man comes on the radio
And he's telling me more and more about some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination

I can't get no
Oh, no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey, that's what I say

When I'm watching my TV and that man comes on to tell me how white my shirts 

[?]
When I'm riding 'round the world and I’m doin’ this and I'm signin’ that
And I'm trying to make some girl

Who tells me, baby maybe come back later next week
' Cause you see I'm on a losing streak

[Intro: Crooks]
Billie

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren’t you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Crooks]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin’ you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & Crooks]
Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I’ll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you’d fall apart
'Cause I’m too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin’ my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge: Billie Eilish]
For the debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
The other day they waited, the sky was dark and faded
Solemnly they stated, "He has to die, you know he has to die"
All the children learnin', from books that they were burnin'
Every leaf was turnin', to watch him die, you know he had to die

The summer sun looked down on him
His mother could but frown on him
And all the other sound on him
He had to die, you know he had to die

[Verse 1]
She reclines, closing her eyes
The sun that set is bound to rise
Night birds and fireflies settle around her
Days grow long, spring is here
Waterfalls will shine again
Our minds have gone down stream
Shooting the rapids

[Verse 2]
Oh, the arctic flame
Bright as the eye of a hurricane
We're all just the same growing children
Every moment is perfect, every sound is a jewel
Every man is a prophet at the mercy of a fool

[Verse 3]
Watch the seasons go, as sunshine turns to cold snow
Chill in the hard rain, numbers of tomorrow
The great globe spins, the music starts
Every beat knows its part
To keep it spinning in a circle
Every moment is perfect, every eye is a jewel
Every man is a prophet with the mercy of a fool

[Chorus: Sage The Gemini]
I love my bitches right now
I love my bitches right now
I love my bitches right now
I love my bitches right now
Oo-oo-ooo-oooo (But tomorrow there's a different start)

[Verse 1: Sage The Gemini]
Roll up in your daddy's salary
I guess that's why all these fuck niggas mad at me
Instagram gangsters bring out the laugh in me
Allergic to bitch niggas y'all acting like allergies yeah
Really man it's understood
That boy no joke, y'all niggas shorted
Last nigga that tried to that tried he took him to his own set
Shot in the leg pieces since he wanted to act 

[?]
Ah, oops I mean hoodlum
Want me for a show, 50k, go ahead book it
All about the Benjamins got 'em running like book 'em
If you ever had hoes then I damn near took 'em
Dope 

[?] got 'em runnin' now lemme shoot 'em
Grapefruit niggas bruise easy, I prune 'em
All these hoes tools now go ahead let me use 'em
In the alley with the S to the A, now let me lose 'em

[Chorus: Sage The Gemini]
I love my bitches right now
I love my bitches right now
I love my bitches right now
I love my bitches right now
Oo-oo-ooo-oooo (But tomorrow there's a different start)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
In love with my bitches, go to the club with my bitches
They always rolling up the weed, that's why I fuck with my bitches
I ain't only got one, I got a couple of bitches
And if I don't go to the club then I double my bitches
I be in trouble with bitches, I kiss and hug on a bitch
And see I pull up with some bitches
That don't mind fucking some bitches
See I ain't cuffing no hoes, no I ain't stuck with no bitches
You try your luck with these bitches
I'm tryna duck all these bitches
See I only want the money, I ain't want all these bitches
Only ride for my dogs, problems come with these bitches
Giving long dick to each and every one of these bitches
Not on the low, do my thing right in front of these bitches
I ain't gon' lie, sometimes I act funny with bitches
Cause I remember days I ain't have none of these bitches
Now a nigga stick and move when it come to these bitches
I get everything I want, then I'm done with these bitches, but uh

[Chorus: Sage The Gemini]
I love my bitches right now
I love my bitches right now
I love my bitches right now
I love my bitches right now
Oo-oo-ooo-oooo (But tomorrow there's a different start)

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, uh, only for the moment
Then I'm on to the next one

Sending our heart out to these hoes
