 out the door
Turn around come back for more
If they won’t let you in line
Say “Fuck you I had a great time”
You ask what I’m fighting
You wanna know what I’m fighting
Curriculum ain’t exciting
Teach given’ em ain’t exciting
Oh it don’t fit the timing
'Cause you always lying
Surprised that we ain’t whining
We we we are trying
Screw you and your chauffeur
We’re taking your sons and daughters
It’s time for social order
Musical social order
And now our lives are shorter
Got the drugs inside the water
Get that news reporter
Now turn on your camcorder

[Chorus: Santigold]

[Hook: Santigold]

[Chorus: Santigold]

[Hook: Santigold]
Lengthy instrumental intro

Got my tweed pressed, got my best vest, all I need now is the girl
Got my striped tie, got my hopes high
Got the time and the place and I got the rhythm
Now all I need's the girl to go with'em

If she'll just appear we'll take this big town for a whirl
And if she'll say "My, darling, I'm yours"
I'll throw away my striped tie and my best-pressed tweed
All I really need is the girl

Lengthy instrumental while Franks hums and scats off and on

Got my tweed pressed, I got my best vest, all I need now is the girl
Got my striped tie, got my hopes 'way up high
I got the time and the place and the rhythm
All I need's the girl to go with'em

Mm, if she'll just appear we'll take this, this great big town for a whirl
And if, if she'll say "My, darlin', I'm yours"
I'll throw away my striped tie and my best-pressed tweed
All I real, really need is the girl
More instrumental with scat

All I need is the girl

[Chorus]
Well, well, it's gon' be nice
It's gon' be nice, mhm
Whatever's in store for me
It's gon' be nice
It's crazy right now, Lord
But that's when You shine
I can't stop shouting knowing it's gon' be nice

[Verse 1]
Well, well, you never promised to me
That my days would be problem-free
But you did promise to
Always take care of me
Right now it seems that my troubles will never end
I know You promise to be my closest friend
And it's gonna be nice

[Chorus]
It's gon' be nice
It's gon' be nice
(Whatever you got in store for me, Lord, Lord, Lord)
Whatever's in store for me

But that's when You shine (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I can't stop shouting knowing it's gon' be nice
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Well, well, I gotta remind myself daily
Who lives inside of me
And when I stay close to you
Close to me you're gonna be
No more crying about my situation
I know what I gotta do
I gotta pray, gotta trust
Gotta believe, depend on you yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
It's gon' be nice (It's gonna be nice, woo)
It's gon' be nice (Whatever you got for me, ha)
Whatever's in store for me (It's gonna be nice)

But that's when You shine (Lord)

It's gon' be nice

[Bridge]
Oh, oh

It's gon' be nice (It's crazy right now)
Whatever's in store for me (Crazy right now but I know)
It's gon' be nice (I can't see my way through this)
It's crazy right now, Lord, but that's when you'll shine
(But I know You're working in the midst)
I can't stop shouting knowing it's gon' be nice
(I can shout right now it's crazy)
It's crazy right now Lord, but that's when you'll shine
(Hey, hey, hey, that's when You come through for me every time, every time)
I can't stop shouting knowing it's gon' be nice
(It's gonna be nice)
If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be travelling on now
There's just too many places I've got to see

But if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

And this bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I can't change

Bye bye, baby, it's been a sweet love yeah, yeah
And though this feeling I can't change
But please don't take this so badly
'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame

But if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And this bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I can't change
Lord, help me, I can't change

Lord, I can't change
Won't you fly high free bird?
Yeah
Well, I'm a voodoo chile
Lord I'm a voodoo chile

Well, the night I was born
Lord I swear the moon turned a fire red
The night I was born
I swear the moon turned a fire red
Well my poor mother cried out "Lord, the gypsy was right!"
And I seen her fell down right dead
(Have mercy)

Well, mountain lions found me there waitin'
And set me on a eagles back
Well, mountain lions found me there
And set me on a eagles wing
(It's the eagles wing, baby, what did I say)
He took me past to the outskirts of infinity
And when he brought me back
He gave me a Venus witch's ring
Hey!
And he said "Fly on, fly on"
Because I'm a voodoo chile, baby, voodoo chile
Hey!
Well, I make love to you
And Lord knows you'll feel no pain
Say, I make love to you in your sleep
And Lord knows you felt no pain
(Have mercy)
'Cause I'm a million miles away
And at the same time I'm right here in your picture frame
(Yeah! What did I say now)
'Cause I'm a voodoo chile
Lord knows I'm a voodoo chile Yeah!

(Yeah, but I say now yeah)

Well my arrows are made of desire
From far away as Jupiter's sulfur mines
Say my arrows are made of desire, desire
From far away as Jupiter's sulfur mines
(Way down by the Methane Sea, yeah)
I have a humming bird and it hums so loud
You think you were losing your mind, hmmm...

Well I float in liquid gardens
And Arizona new red sand
(Yeah)
I float in liquid gardens
Way down in Arizona red sand
Well, I taste the honey from a flower named Blue
Way down in California
And the New York drowns as we hold hands

'Cause I'm a voodoo chile
Lord knows I'm a voodoo chile
Yeah!
(Pass me by, pass me by, if you don't happen to like it, pass me by)
I got me ten fine toes to wiggle in the sand
Lots of idle fingers snap to my command
A loverly pair of heels that kick to beat the band
Contemplating nature can be fascinating
Add to these a nose that I can thumb, and a mouth by gum have I
So tell the whole wide world, if you don't happen to like it
Deal me out, thank you kindly, pass me by

(I got me ten fine toes to wiggle in the sand,)
(Lots of idle fingers snap to my command,)
(A loverly pair of heels that kick to beat the band,)
(Contemplating nature can be fascinating)
(Add to these a nose that I can thumb, and a mouth by gum have I)
(So tell the whole wide world, if you don't happen to like it,)
(Deal me out, thank you kindly, pass me by.)
(Pass me by, pass me by, if you don't happen to like it, pass me by.)
Behold me two great shoes that never saw a shine
Houses I could hold up with a laundry line
A loverly patch that hide an awful lot of spine
Shirtails flying, I'm a blooming dandelion
Add to these, a grin from ear to ear, all the proper gear have I
So tell the whole wide world, if you don't like the thought of it
Bail me out, thank you kindly, pass me by
Keep on, keep on doing it
Right on, right on doing it
Baby, keep on
Right on
Keep on doing it
Now, my baby, keep on
Keep on, keep on
Wherever, wherever girl, I'll do it
Forever and ever, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll see you through it
I've got to keep you pleased
In every way I can
Gonna give you all of me
As much as you can stand
Make love to you right now
That's all I want to do
I know you need it, girl
And you know I need it, too
'Cause I found
What the world is searching for
Here, right here, my dear
I don't have to look no more
And, oh, my babe
I hoped and I prayed
For someone just like you
To make me feel the way you do
I'm never, never gonna give ya up
I'm never, ever gonna stop
Not the way I feel about you
Girl, I just can't live without you
I'm never ever gonna quit
'Cause quitin' just ain't my shtick
I'm gonna stay right here with you
Do all the things you want me to
Whatever you want
Girl, you got it
And whatever you need
I don't want to see you without it
You've given me much more
Than words could ever say
And oh, my dear, I'll be right here
Until my dying day
I don't know just how to say
All the things I feel
I just know that I love you so
And it gives me such a thrill
'Cause I found
What this world is searching for
Here, right here, my dear
I don't have to look no more
And all of my days
I hoped and I prayed
For someone just like you
To make me feel the way you do
I'm never, never gonna give ya up
I'm never, ever gonna stop
Stop the way I feel about you
Girl, I just can't live without you
I'm never ever gonna quit
'Cause quitin' just ain't my shtick
I'm gonna stay right here with you
Do all the things you want me to
Oh, I'm never gonna give ya up
I'm never, ever gonna stop
All the things I feel about you
Girl, I just can't live without you
I'm never ever gonna quit
'Cause quitin' just ain't my shtick
Fat man lookin' in a blade of steel
Thin man lookin' at his last meal
Hollow man lookin' in a cottonfield
For dignity

Wise man lookin' in a blade of grass
Young man lookin' in the shadows that pass
Poor man lookin' through painted glass
For dignity

Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave
I went into the city, went into the town
Went into the land of the midnight sun

Searchin' high, searchin' low
Searchin' everywhere I know
Askin' the cops wherever I go
Have you seen dignity?

Blind man breakin' out of a trance
Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance
Hopin' to find one circumstance
Of dignity
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou
She said "Don't want nobody see me talkin' to you"
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew
About dignity

I went down where the vultures feed
I would've got deeper, but there wasn't any need
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Wasn't any difference to me

Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade
House on fire, debts unpaid
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid
Have you seen dignity?

Drinkin' man listens to the voice he hears
In a crowded room full of covered up mirrors
Lookin' into the lost forgotten years
For dignity

Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used
He wanted money up front, said he was abused
By dignity

Footprints runnin' cross the sliver sand
Steps goin' down into tattoo land
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
In the border towns of despair
Got no place to fade, got no coat
I'm on the rollin' river in a jerkin' boat
Tryin' to read a note somebody wrote
About dignity

Sick man lookin' for the doctor's cure
Lookin' at his hands for the lines that were
And into every masterpiece of literature
For dignity

Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
Combin' his hair back, his future looks thin
Bites the bullet and he looks within
For dignity

Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed
Dignity never been photographed
I went into the red, went into the black
Into the valley of dry bone dreams

So many roads, so much at stake
So many dead ends, I'm at the edge of the lake
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take
To find dignity
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take you
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go

Jamaica, off the Florida Keys
There's a place called Kokomo
That's where you wanna go
To get away from it all

Bodies in the sand
Tropical drink melting in your hand
We'll be falling in love
To the rhythm of a steel drum band
Down in Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby, why don't we go

Ooh, I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go, way down in Kokomo
Martinique, that Monserrat mystique

We'll put out to sea
And we'll perfect our chemistry
By and by, we'll defy a little bit of gravity

Afternoon delight, cocktails and moonlit nights
That dreamy look in your eye
Give me a tropical contact high, way down in Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take you
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby, why don't we go

Ooh, I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go, way down in Kokomo

Port au Prince, I wanna catch a glimpse

Everybody knows a little place like Kokomo
Now if you wanna go and get away from it all
Go down to Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take you
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby, why don't we go
Ooh, I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go, way down in Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take you
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go
For all you done and what you gon' do
For all your blessings we give praise to You
Mercy, loving, kindness and grace
For directing our steps and guiding our way

So with thankful hearts and spirits
And all of our hands raised
We come to the throne of the Father
And we give You continual praise

Continual praise, let us all join together
Continual praise, from the past to forever
We were created like angels to praise Him
To raise Him and lift Him high
So let us all just lift His name high to the sky
As we sing shout with our might in continual praise

The sun, the moon and all of the stars
Display the awesomeness of our God
His marvelous works and awesome display
His mighty acts we witness everyday
So with thankful hearts and spirits
And all of our hands raised
We come to the throne of the Father
And we give You continual praise

Continual praise, let us all join together
Continual praise, from the past to forever
We were created like angels to praise Him
To raise Him and lift Him high
So let us all just lift His name high to the sky
As we sing shout with our might in continual praise

Continual praise, let us all join together
Continual praise, from the past to forever
We were created like angels to praise Him
To raise Him and lift Him high
So let us all just lift His name high to the sky
As we sing shout with our might in continual praise

Let your praise go on, praise go on
Let your praise go on, praise go on
Let your praise go on, praise go on

Praise go on
Praise go on
Praise go on
I let it go on, let it go on, let it go on, let it go on
Let your praise go on
Let your praise go on
Let your praise go on

For all He's done, you oughta praise Him
For what He will do, praise Him
For wakin' you up, praise Him
Starting you on your way, and letting you see another day
Praise Him, praise Him
Dear Prudence, Won't You Come Out And Play ? Dear Prudence Meet The Brand New Day
The Sun Is Up, The Sky Is Blue, It's Beautiful and So Are You

[Verse 1]
Tell us, once again, this morning, old friend
How did you win the war?
Everybody loves a hero
It won't matter if we've heard your tale before
Tell us of the time when almost everybody knew you were a star
And how intelligent you are
Prove that you're alive, Mr. Shuck 'n' Jive

[Verse 2]
Tell us of the man who stole your fortune
And nearly ruined your life
Or, better still, the one about the TV and the couch
And your best friend's wife
Tell us of grand projects never finished with somebody else to blame
And all the reasons that your fame
Never did arrive, Mr. Shuck 'n Jive

[Scat Interlude]

[Verse 3]
If you can get yourself together
Kindly write a criticism of this song
How it's exquisitely constructed, yet mechanical
And somehow slightly wrong
Put it in your book about the enemy you never even met
You know, you just might make it yet
But I don't think you'll survive, Mr. Shuck 'n Jive

[Outro]
You know, you just might make it yet (Yet)
Mr. Shuck 'n Jive
The greatest lost track of all time
The late greats', "Turpentine"
You can't hear it on the radio
You can't hear it anywhere you go
The best band will never get signed
K-Settes starring Butcher's blind
Are so good, you won't ever know
They never even played a show
You can't hear 'em on the radio
The greatest singer in rock and roll
Would have to be Romeo
His vocal chords are made of gold
He just looks a little too old
The best song will never get sung
The best laugh never leaves your lungs
So good, you won't ever know
You can't hear it on the radio
You can't hear it on the radio

[Verse 1]
May I have this dance
I've been waitin for this chance
All night long (All night long)
And this night I'll always treasure
If I could have the pleasure
To escort you

[Verse 2]
Don't you know I've bit my nails in two
Wantin to dance with you
But I was much too shy
I never had the nerve
Before you'd dance across the floor with another guy

[Verse 3]
The way he held you in his arms
With his many charms
I knew my chances were slim
In order to get to you
There's only one thing to do
So I got rid of him
Hey

[Verse 4]
Ooh hoo I told him that a girl
By the name of Pearl
Was looking for him
And when I turned around
He was nowhere to be found
So here I am

[Verse 5]
Ooh I gotta have this dance (Gotta have this dance with you)
Honey I (Gotta have this dance with you)
Honey I, honey I, honey I, have this dance
Honey I (Gotta have this dance with you)
Gotta have this dance
Oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah..
I was a lover, a leader of men
All of the women I knew were my friends
I was so happy, my feet on the ground
I didn't know I was on the way down
Cause you don't feel the same
It's only a game, it's only a game, it's only a game

Ah, ah, ah, ah..
I had a billion or two in the bank
I gave to charity, ain't got no thanks
You gave me all that a woman could give
Less your affection, I don't want to live
Cause you don't feel the same
It's only a game, it's only a game, it's only a game

Cause you don't feel the same

I was a lover, a leader of men
All of the women I knew were my friends
I was so happy, my feet on the ground
I didn't know, I was on the way down
Cause you don't feel the same
It's only a game, it's only a game, it's only a game
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...
Will I live tomorrow?
Well I just can't say
Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say

But I know for sure
I don't live today

No sun coming through my windows
Feel like I'm sitting at the bottom of a grave
No sun coming through my windows
Feel like I'm sitting at the bottom of a grave

I wish you'd hurry up 'n' rescue me
So I can be on my mis'rable way

I don't live today;
It's such a shame to waste your time away like this

Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say
Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say
I know for sure
I don't live today
When tides at ease on the evening breeze
And the scarlet moon starts its gentle rise
The drowsy whale spouts a misty trail
And the stars gather slowly in the skies

These are the times when I know
How alone one can be
And I yearn to go once again
Back to my girl down in Port of Spain

On some distant shore as I walk the sand
And watch the lovers meet
They stand in the moonlight hand in hand
With the surf breaking over their feet

These are the times when I know
How alone one can be
And I yearn to go once again
Back to my girl down in Port of Spain

In Mandalay at a gay cafe
In the wee little hours of morn
When guitars and violins end their play
With a hymn to the goddess of dawn
These are the times when I know
How alone one can be
And I yearn to go once again
Back to my girl down in Port of Spain
I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows i'm miserable now

I was looking for a job, and then i found a job
And heaven knows i'm miserable now

In my life
Why do i give valuable time
To people who don't care if i live or die ?

Two lovers entwined pass me by
And heaven knows i'm miserable now

I was looking for a job, and then i found a job
And heaven knows i'm miserable now

In my life
Oh, why do i give valuable time
To people who don't care if i live or die ?

What she asked of me at the end of the day
Caligula would have blushed
"oh, you've been in the house too long" she said
And i (naturally) fled

In my life
Why do i smile
At people who i'd much rather kick in the eye ?

I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows i'm miserable now

"oh, you've been in the house too long" she said
And i (naturally) fled

In my life
Oh, why do i give valuable time
L: All this violence is puzzling
Maybe the law should intervene
M: All this violence is threatening
Hate is in need of censoring

L+M: Ban hate and violence for our convenience (x2)
(Repeat once)

L: Don't we all know the dangers
Of two conflicting viewpoints?
M: An active troublemaker (?)
Banning the flame of dissent
L+M: So much aggravation!
L: To all haters: We'll create some laws to stop you

To...

Something like: "once you catch them, kill them, kill
Them")

(Repeat once)
You're gonna fix my heart
You're gonna free my soul
Not many learn what
The two of us can do
Or what we do it for
Sign my name
I'm gonna join your club
You give me love and there's
Two of us to feel
Just say the word
And I'm giving my love to you

You got me backtafunk
And I'm still turning
Got me backtafunk
And I'm still turning
I can't explain, no alibi
The rhythm got me paralyzed
You got me

You call it deja vu
Of being there before
So many lose what
The few of us can find
And never mention
You're gonna break my will
You're gonna take me down
So many pay
When the two of us can steal
So give what I want
And I could be a king for you
You got me
Backtafunk
And I'm still turning
Got me backtafunk
And I'm still turning
You got me backtafunk
I was so disorganized
Rhythm cut me down to size
You got me

Help me I'm in trouble deep
High as I can go
It's no crime
There may be love on the street
And I'm bad enough
You got me drowning in my sleep
But I will find you when I wake
And it's time
You got me backtafunk

Backtafunk to back
Backtafunk
Backtafunk to back
Backtafunk
Backtafunk to back
Backtafunk
Oh, oh I'm still turning
Backtafunk
Oh, oh I'm still burning
Backtafunk
Oh, oh I'm still learning
Did you know that you could be wrong
And swear you're right?
Some people been known to do it all their lives
But you find yourself alone just like you found yourself before
Like I found myself in pieces on the hotel floor

Hard times have helped me see

I'm a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I'm right here and I'm right now
And I'm open knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now

Well I ain't no troublemaker
And I never meant her harm
But it doesn't mean I didn't make it hard to carry on
Well it sucks to be honest
And it hurts to be real
But it's nice to make some love that I can finally feel
Hard times, let me be

I'm a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I'm right here and I'm right now
And I'm open knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now

I'm a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I'm right here and I'm right now
And I'm open knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now
Fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love
My heart above my head

Though I see
The danger there
If there's a chance for me
Then I don't care

Fools rush in
Where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love
So how are they to know

When we met
I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let
This fool rush in

[Spoken Intro: R. Kelly & Nivea]
Baby, I wanna do something different tonight a'ight?
Okay, what you wanna do?
I want you to sing to me, while I sing to you
Why don't we do this?
Okay

[Verse 1: R. Kelly & Nivea]
Touching you, touching me, satisfying your every need
You won't have to work for nothing
After I give you this loving
Touching you, touching me, sexual chemistry
Girl, seems like your body's ready
And I know you won't regret it
Turn the lights down low, ready to let my juices flow
Baby, double lock the door, let's start right here on this floor
Sounds like the perfect plan, we're seconds away from loveland
All you gotta do is take my hand
Now tell me, baby, who's your man?
You babe
Who?
You, babe
You
I'm your lady, all friends are gone, perfect
Now come and take it, baby

[Chorus: both + R. Kelly & Nivea]
Let it go, let it flow
It's alright, it's okay, we're alone, baby
Baby, I don't mind if you take off my clothes
Let it go, let it flow
It's alright, it's okay, we're alone, baby
Baby girl, you can be loud, no one will know
Let it go, let it flow
It's alright, it's okay, we're alone, baby
Baby, we can take our time
Let it go, let it flow
It's alright, it's okay, we're alone baby
So let's keep on touchin', baby

[Interlude: R. Kelly & Nivea]
Yeah, I liked that
Me too
Keep going
Okay

[Verse 2: R. Kelly & Nivea]
Raindrops falling, love angels calling
Something tells me this could be, the greatest sex in history
All these nights, girl, I vow
To make you cry when I go down
I am here to please you, baby
Taste your love and drive you crazy
Like a summer breeze, bursting trees
Loving the way you pleasing me
Bite my lips to keep from screaming
Baby boy, it's like I'm dreaming
For me the same when positions change
Making me wanna scream your name
It's like heaven matched us up
Such a blessing we hooked up
You babe
Who?
You babe
You

All friends are gone, perfect
Now come and take it, baby

[Chorus: both + R. Kelly & Nivea]
Let it go, let it flow
It's alright, it's okay, we're alone, baby
Baby, I don't mind if you take off my clothes
Let it go, let it flow
It's alright, it's okay, we're alone, baby
Baby girl, you can be loud, no one will know
Let it go, let it flow
It's alright, it's okay, we're alone, baby
Girl, sing it to me
Baby, we can take our time
Let it go, let it flow
It's alright, it's okay, we're alone baby
So let's keep on touching, baby

[Bridge: both + R. Kelly + Nivea]
You
You, oh baby
Oh, boy
Let's keep on touching, baby
Yeah
Oh I love the way you touch me right there
You, you send chills up and down my spine
Go deeper (deeper), deeper (deeper)
Tell me how you like it, baby
Give it more or draw back, baby
Deeper (deeper), deeper (deeper)
Don't hold back, faster, babe
All alone so let's go crazy
Make love to me, like you never made love before
I wanna hear you screaming
I wanna hear you screaming, screaming baby, give me more

[Chorus: both + R. Kelly & Nivea]
Let it go, let it flow
It's alright, it's okay, we're alone, baby
Everyone's gone...
And it feels so right, it can't be wrong
Let it go, let it flow
It's alright, it's okay, we're alone, baby
Ooh, I'm so glad that we're alone
Ooh, this sex kinda turnin' this house into a happy home
Let it go, let it flow
It's alright, it's okay, we're alone, baby
Just like tasting raindrops, pretty lady, don't you stop
Got me going round and round, just bring my loving right on down
Let it go, let it flow
It's alright, it's okay, we're alone baby
I love you...and I love you
Let's keep on touchin', baby

[Outro over chorus: R. Kelly & (Nivea) + both]
Keep on touching, baby (Touch me)
Keep on touching, baby (Touch me)
Keep on touching, baby (Touch me)
Keep on touching, baby (Touch me)
Keep on touching, baby (Touch me)
Keep on touching, baby (Touch me)
Keep on touching, baby (Touch me)
Keep on touching, baby (Touch me)

Let it go, let it flow
It's alright, it's okay, we're alone baby
Let's keep on touchin', baby

[Verse 1: David Ruffin]
Ooh, lonely man am I
Ever since you said goodbye
Girl, I know that I should have woke up
'Cause I see it now that we've broke up
Your farewell kiss is haunting me
My tooting lips cry out constantly
Let your heart, let your heart be your guide
Forget about your foolish pride

[Pre-Chorus: David Ruffin & (The Temptations)]
Starting tomorrow I keep telling myself
(I need ya; baby, I need ya)
I'm gonna get out and find somebody else
(I need ya; baby, I need ya)
Somebody that's sweet and kind
(I need ya; baby, I need ya)
Who will erase you out of my mind

[Chorus: David Ruffin & (The Temptations)]
But tell me, how could I find somebody new, baby?
(It's you that I need)
When my two arms keep reaching out for you?
(It's you that I need)
And my two lips keep right on repeating
It's you that I need (Baby, I need you)

[Verse 2: David Ruffin]
You know that even when I close my eyes to forget ya
I see your face and your memories too
Girl, I've never felt this loneliness before
And hoo, girl, I just can't take it no more
Every night a million tears I shed
Girl, next morning going out of my head
Just take a good look and you'll see
What this loneliness is doing to me

[Bridge: David Ruffin & The Temptations]
Baby, it's you that need
Don't you know that it's you that I need?
Oh, I can't take this loneliness
It's you that I need
Oh baby, I need ya
It's you that I need; baby, I need ya

[Outro: David Ruffin & (The Temptations)]
Some fool I'm gonna be no more
'Cause I'll soon be knocking, knocking on your door
Gonna get down on my bended knees
Beg and plead, girl, come back to me
It's you that I need
(Every night a million tears I shed)
Girl, it's you that I need
(Very soon going out of my head)
Girl, take a good look and you'll see
What does this loneliness is doing to me
Just friends
Lovers no more
Just friends
But not like before
To think of what we've been
And not to kiss again
Seems like pretending
It isn't the ending
Two friends
Drifting apart
Two friends
But one broken heart
We loved we laughed we cried
Then suddenly love died
The story ends
And we're
Just friends
We loved we laughed and we cried
Then suddenly love died
The story ends
And we're
Just friends
Funny
All she needs is love
And this Sony light
Is all there is tonight
Oh yeah

Funny
She dreams about his touch
Where his skin must end
And where her own begins

She moves through shadows
Bathes in the lush
Luxurious hush alone
Ever alone

Miss Lonely
Needs company
As she breathes this room
Of deepest blue perfume
Love's where you find it
Open your heart
You've lived in the dark too long
Too long alone

Miss Lonely
Open up your heart
Let the morning light
Fill your sky tonight

Funny
All she needs is love
And this Sony light
Is all there is tonight

Yeah right
Feeling so alone tonight
So inside
So deep inside
Granada, I'm falling under your spell
And if you could speak, what a fascinating tale you would tell
Of an age the world has long forgotten
Of an age that weaves a silent magic in Granada today

The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada
For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wander along
Entranced by the beauty before me
Entranced by a land full of flowers and song
When day is done and the sun starts to set in Granada
I envy the blush of the snow-clad Sierra Nevada
Soon it will welcome the stars
While a thousand guitars play a soft cabanera
Then moonlit Granada will live again
The glory of yesterday, romantic and gay

(musical interlude)

And soon it will welcome the stars
While a gang of guitars play a soft cabanera
Then moonlit Granada will live again
The glory of yesterday, romantic, ay Granada
Oh, I know you've been cheatin' on me, baby
And I know you don't mean me no good
Hey, I know you've been cheatin' on me, baby
And I know you don't mean me no good
That's why I blame myself, baby
Because I didn't treat you like I should

Oh, I was too good to you baby
I gave you everything I own
Oh, I was too good, too good to you, baby
Gave you everything I own

That's why I blame myself, baby
Every time you do me wrong

Hey, you've got your eyes wide open, baby
But you're traveling down the wrong road
Oh, your eyes is wide open, baby
But your traveling down the wrong road
A wine drinkin' and a cheatin' woman
Is one thing I can't afford

[Verse 1]
She pulls the shade, it's just another sunny Sunday
She dodges the light like Blanche DuBois
Bright colors fade away on such a sunny Sunday
She waits for the night to fall

[Verse 2]
Then she points a pistol through the door
And she aims at the streetlight while the freeway hisses
Dogs bark as the gun falls to the floor
The streetlight's still burning, she always misses

[Bridge]
But the day she hits, that's the day she'll leave
That one little victory, that's all she needs

[Outro]
She pulls the shade, it's just another sunny Monday
She waits for the night to fall
There's a beautiful girl
And a handsome guy
She's sitting all alone
He's giving her the eye

They approach one another
They don't realize the danger

What will they say
What do you think
She'll crack another smile
He'll buy another drink

That isn't the important part
That happens later

You should have listened to your mother
Don't ever talk to strangers

Lust turns to boredom
Boredom turns to lust
Diminishing returns
With each and every thrust
The energy's preserved
Just converted into anger

Don't take candy
Don't get in someone's car
Don't let anybody touch you
No matter who they are

The police are at your door
Turns out the killer was your neighbor

He seemed like such a normal guy
A little quiet, nothing major

You should have listened to your mother
Don't ever talk to strangers
So cool, calm and collected
You had a style, a rakish style
Well, my poor heart never connected
You'd stay so long on my mind

Well, isn't it midnight
On the other side of the world?
Do you remember
The face of a pretty girl?
Isn't it midnight
On the other side of the world?
Do you remember
The face of a pretty girl?

Looking back so long ago
You had a knack, a knack of making women know
Ooh, there wasn't the time
And I knew you'd never be mine

Well, isn't it midnight
On the other side of the world?
Do you remember
The face of a pretty girl?
Isn't it midnight
On the other side of the world?
Do you remember
The face of a pretty girl?
Isn't it midnight
On the other side of the world?
Do you remember
The face of a pretty girl?
Isn't it midnight
On the other side of the world?
Do you remember
The face of a pretty girl?
Isn't it midnight
On the other side of the world?
Do you remember
The face of a pretty girl?

[Verse 1]
Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be? You're not here with me
You never said goodbye, someone tell me, why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself, "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
You are not alone

[Post-Chorus]
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

[Verse 2]
Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand, then forever can begin

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself, "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
And you are not alone

[Bridge]
Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone

[Chorus 1]
Well, you've got me dancing in a figure of eight
Don't know if I'm coming or going, I'm early or late
Round and round the ring I go
I want to know
I want to know

[Verse 1]
Why can't we travel a continuous line?
Make a love a reliable covenant all the time
Up and down the hills I go
I got to know
I got to know

[Chorus 2]
Is it better to love one another
Than to go for a walk in the dark?
Is it better to love than to give in to hate?
Yeah, we'd better take good care of each other
Avoid slipping back off the straight and narrow
It's better by far than getting stuck in a figure of eight

[Bridge]
Well, figure it out for yourself, little girl
I don't go nowhere at all
It's nothing more than a tape loop in a big dance hall

[Chorus 1]
Well, you've got me dancing in a figure of eight
Don't know if I'm coming or going, I'm early or late
Round and round the ring I go
I want to know
I want to know

[Chorus 2]
Is it better to love one another
Than to go for a walk in the dark?
Is it better to love than to give in to hate?
Yeah, we'd better take good care of each other
Avoid slipping back off the straight and narrow
It's better by far than getting stuck in a figure of eight

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
The feeling we used to get whenever our lips met
Like smoke from a cigarette, it's fading away
Fading away, fading away
It hurts me to think about how love where there was no doubt
Like a cloud when the sun comes out, it's fading away
Fading away, fading away

[Chorus]
You've changed and it's showing, baby
You've changed and it's showing, tell me
Where is your love going?

[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
The plans we were making up, for I'll never breaking up
Like dreams when you're waking up, are fading away
Fading away, fading away
The good times we shared a lot, when you really cared a lot
Like steam from a coffee pot, it's fading way
Fading away, fading away

[Chorus]
You've changed and it's showing, baby
You've changed and it's showing, tell me
Where is your love going?

[Verse 3: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
Like smoke from a cigarette or dreams that you soon forget
Our love from the day we met, it's fading away
Fading away, fading away

[Chorus]
You've changed and it's showing, baby
You've changed and it's showing, tell me
Where is your love going, going?
You've changed and it's showing, baby
You've changed and it's showing, tell me
Where is your love going, going?

[Outro]
You've changed and it's showing, baby
Baby
Listen baby

Through the mirror of my mind
Time after time
I see reflections of you and me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world of a distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
'Cause although you're gone
I keep holdin' on to those happy times
Oh, when you were mine

Oh and I peer through the window of lost time
Lookin' over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain

All the love
All the love that I've wasted
All the tears
All the tears that I've tasted all in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt that you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects the love that used to be

Oh, into you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust
Oh, after all the nights
I sat alone and wept
Just a handful of promises
Are all that's left of lovin' you

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me
I've got reflections of love
That used to be
I've got reflections of love
That won't set me free
I've got reflections baby

You took my world to dust
Yes you did, yeah

Miscellaneous
Candy
Candy, I call my sugar Candy, because I'm sweet on Candy, and Candy's sweet on me
She understands me, my understanding Candy, and Candy's always handy
When I need sympathy, I wish that there were four of her
So I could love much more of her
She has taken my complete heart, got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart
Candy, it's gonna be just dandy, the day I take my Candy
And make her mine, all mine
I found a friend
Who says he hasn't any fears
He has a brother
Who's been sailing here for years

But if I have this friend for long
He'll hear this sad confusing song
And look away from all he thinks he knows
And wonder where it goes

Turn his head and look away
Alone, alone
Turn his head and look away
Alone, alone

And I found a friend
Who says he's shedding no more tears
Got him a woman
Who will love him through the years

If I've ever known his dreams
Things are all the way they seem
He'll walk away from all his promises
And laugh about betrayal
Turn his head and look away
Alone, alone
Turn his head and look away
Alone, alone

And I found a friend
Who has not been here very long
He goes 'round and 'round
And spins you out a song

He says his memory's to blame
When nothing ever sounds the same
Here, "I'm going inside the words", he said
And crawl back out the hole

Turn his head and look away
Alone, alone
Turn his head and look away
Alone, alone

And I found a friend
Who says he cannot sleep at night
He lies awake
And balls his fists to beat the fright

He says it's hard to get ahead
And things are better done than said
It's a lonesome situation here
Hard and long and gone
Turn his head and look away
Alone, alone
Turn his head and look away
Alone, alone

And I found some friends
Who turn their heads and look away
(Man, what's wrong with you)
With all their reasons
Sounding good for things they say

If I have these friends for long
I'd get so lost inside this song
I'd get away from what I'm leaning on
Go on and on and on

Turn my head and look away
Alone
Turn my head and look away
Alone, alone

Turn my head and look away
Alone, alone
Turn my head and look away
Alone, alone
When I was a young man
I ran away from home
I went to join the circus

Went to see the cotton candy whirl
And make me lots of money on my own
For Molly, oh my pretty Molly
But she's waiting all alone
Someday soon I will return to her

Then I made the big time
Bright lights show biz
I'm really in the circus
There's only one thing wrong

I haven't saved a penny on my own
For Molly, oh my pretty Molly
But she's writing everyday
Molly understands so it's okay

Ride a windy box car
See a thousand children young and old
Oh that grease paint smile
Can hide your soul
Here comes a carousel
Guess which town it is
Feel the thrill
Grease paint covers everything
But winters chill
I'm reading Molly's letter
The ink is fading
And the page is turning yellow
Long ago I promised Molly
Don't you know I

I will close my eyes and go to her
If I look like home to you, if I am your sign
Don't try to understand it, girl, when I draw the line
It hasn't come to this that you can say I waste my time
Looking everywhere, going nowhere

For the skies they look so lazy now, heavy are the clouds
There's nothing here that I could learn or what it's all about
You haven't said a thing to me and you talk so very loud
Looking everywhere, going nowhere

Well I think I'll try the circus or go back to Mexico
It's time to make mistakes again, it's time to change the show
It's time and time and time again to find another way
It's time to gather forces and get out of yesterday

Because I lost what I was looking for, there's nothing left to share
I need to take myself away to be some other where
A face, a life, a minute more, I don't think I can spare
Looking everywhere, going nowhere

Cause I tell you when you hurt me and you just don't seem to know
I inform you that I'm lonely and you still don't think I'll go
So if I lie to you and smile a thought, it's only half way here
It's just the circus, and I'm singing I'm never really near
If I look like home to you, If I am your sign
Don't try to understand it, girl, when I draw the line
It hasn't come to this that you can say I waste my time
Looking everywhere
Looking everywhere
Looking anywhere, going nowhere

[Verse]
Funny how secrets travel
I'd start to believe if I were to bleed
Thin skies, the man chains his hands held high
Cruise me, blond
Cruise me, babe
A blond belief beyond, beyond, beyond
No return, no return
I'm deranged
Deranged, down, down, down
I'm deranged, down, down, down
So cruise me, babe, cruise me, babe, beyond

[Chorus]
And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
Cruise me, cruise me, cruise me, baby

[Outro]
The clutch of life...

[Verse 1]
About four years ago while I was on the grind
Everybody was telling me I was just wasting my time
But then about two weeks ago my n**ga I got signed
So I had to leave Columbia without saying goodbye
And now I'm finishing my album up while at the same time catching up on algebra
Everybody where's Bobby ???
But I ain't round now, I'm in California
But I still rep the ?? where it's greater
Born in North Carolina, raised up like a razor
Sharp enough to turn some player haters to a plate of taters
I ain't fucking with y'all, I'm trying to fuck in my Mercedes
Benz, blowing on they grinch, I'm gone in the wind
Everybody popping up, they trying to be my friend
Playing that pretend, so I just pretend
That I don't even seem em', so to me they don't exist

[Verse 2]
Peace
But no, I ain't gone Hollywood
I'm still in the hood and I blow a lot of good
And when I'm out I don't roll without my buds
My buddy and my slut and the best, best buds
Gotta get a ??? just to roll it up
So If you in the need baby come on take a puff
Come and stay with us if you wanna make a fuss
In the middle of the night tell ya boyfriend hush (DAMN)
But no don't take it personal
You so bad when you move with earth my soul
And this nigga wanna hop and just ???
But be careful, this thing it'll hurt you fool
Oh yes yes I'm a beast and now I hunt ya sleep to put it honestly
I'm like a monster at lunching season (HEY)
And the game is my prey and I'm munching people

[Verse 3]
I'm going 20 times gold out the gate
Cause the game is a hoe and I'm holding her waist
I'm holding her tight so she know when to sway
When I'm holding a mic they won't know what to say
I got what you need like a bowl of chilly
And my flows stone cold like I froze it in a tray
In the middle of the ocean, I'm floating away
That's why they call me B.O.B
I ain't really in this for the Benjamins and dough
I'm just trying to get me a percentage of the globe
And when I'm done with it, man I'm finished, I'ma ghost
I'm just trying to put the truth in your earlobes
So be easy, but the bitterness away
Cause I'm critically acclaimed and I'm clinically insane
I'm finna get up in it, I ain't finna hesitate
Like a n**ga on the building finna take his life away

[Verse 4]
But I don't want to die, I just want to ride
Off a ???, that's where I reside
This is where the struggle is and this is why we strive to breathe
Pinching pennies to make ends meet day and night
Even though this ain't no paradise, n**gas carry knives or a pair of nines to make sure they still survive
We just trying to make it out to see a better life
But they call us thugs cause' the sun never ever shines
So if you know what I'm talking about and you really feel me
We puffin killa killas, so we got us feeling silly
That's why I'm repping for my town and my city
Cause when you from the hood they treat you like you no good

[Verse 5]
That's why I got all the brother calling me
I spit that real shit, and yes it's quality
If you don't like it dawg, my apologies
But nobody saying nothing back when I ain't had nothing
Now ever single body trying to get up on my
But I tell em get to stepping while I'm stepping
I was broke but now I'm kind of riding like a
Cause the east side in Dakota's where I'm repping
Yeah, I got the crack you scratch and sniff and then you get addicted
I got that shit, It'll have you sick, and no you can not fix it
I'm about to drop some classic hits so I'ma snatch the hitlist
So put your aprons on cause it's hazardous to listen

[Verse 6]
I ain't really into making baller music
Cause I was never balling
I'm in love with a real fine woman and she gives me everything
I said I'm in love with a real fine woman and she gives me everything
And it makes me feel so good, just to hear my baby call my name

My baby's sly way of loving, makes me feel so good I could sing
Hey my baby's sly way of loving, makes me feel so good I could sing
I feel just like I'm a millionaire, when I hear my baby call my name

Oh, there ain't nobody like my baby, that's the reason I love her so
Oh, ain't nobody, nobody like my baby, that's the reason I love her so
People, I would even die for her, I want the whole round world to know

When I'm down she'll picks me up, she says, "Daddy, you can't lose"
Oh, when I'm down, when I'm down, she picks me up, tells me, "Baby, you can't lose"
When all of my friends forget about me, my baby keeps away all these blues

[Verse 1]
Surprise
Girl, I bet you thought I had went and forgot
It's a special day
Tonight, your gift will be something you will remember
For the rest of your days, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
(So get ready and I'll take you out) and show you some love
(Show you what partying is all about) once we hit the club

[Chorus]
(It's your birthday) so let's party and have some fun
(It's your birthday) we'll dance 'til the morning comes, yeah
(Happy birthday) girl, let's step the night away
(Happy birthday) yeah, and we're gonna celebrate, yeah

Do do do do do do do do do do do...

[Verse 2]
Ooh, we'll be laughing and singing and grooving on the way, yeah
With smiles upon our face, oh yeah
Nothing but VIP, darling, for you and me
And there's so many dancing feet
Dancing in harmony

[Pre-Chorus]
(So get ready and I'll take you out) and show you some love, yeah
(Show you what a party is all about) once we hit the club, yeah

[Chorus]
(It's your birthday) we're gonna party and have some fun, girl
(It's your birthday) and we'll dance 'til the morning comes, yeah
(Happy birthday) oh, let's step the night away
(Happy birthday) we're gonna celebrate, let's go

Do do do do do do do do do do...

You said you want to love my baby
But now you changed your mind
You said you're gonna be true babe
Until the end of time
Then you started messin' round with me baby
Tryin' to do lovin' daddy no good
Since you've been bad with my lovin' baby
I don't think I'm gonna move into your neighbourhood
Eh, I don't need no grocery boy
I'm gonna fetch them ev'ry day
I don't want no grocery boy
You gotta keep that boy, keep that boy away
I've been sittin' here thinkin'
About that baby, baby, on my mind
Well, I've been lovin' you baby
But, oh baby, always treat me unkind
I'll buy you fur coat for Christmas
And a diamond ring
No matter how you treat me baby
I can hear my lonely heart sing
Yeah. I been sittin' here thinkin' baby
I've been missin' her, thinkin' about
That baby on my mind
I've gotta leave you baby
Babe, woman you been, uah-ha-ha, aha-ha-ha
She's been sittin' here thinkin'
About that baby, on my mind
Whoa-whoa-whoa

[Verse 1]
It all started last week when I went on a date
She was beautiful, blonde hair, I picked her up at 8
I decided to take her to a magic show
My mom said I shouldn't, but what does she know?
"A lobster for my lady friend, cooked extra nice
And some amaretto afterward would be just right
Thank you, garcon, this is gonna be magnificent
Oh, the lights went down, time for the entertainment"
The magician took the stage and sawed a lady in half
I could see her legs, so fake, made me laugh!
Then they asked for a volunteer from the audience
I hid my face - no way, leave me out of it!
Next thing I know, my girl is volunteering for me
She tells me she thinks "Men on stage are very sexy!"
So I play along, and go up on stage
Hoping the stunt will get me... you know!

[Verse 2]
So now they want to hypnotize me
They'll ring a bell, and I'll cluck like a turkey
I say "Yeah right! Do your best!
This whole thing's faker than Pam Anderson's chest!"
Big laugh from the audience, they loved that joke
Then appeared the hypnotist in a cloud of smoke
"At the count of three and the sound of a bell
You'll close your eyes and be under my spell"
"Ready, here we go, one, two, three, ding!"
I opened my eyes and... nothing!
But wherever I looked, the crowd wouldn't stop laughing
What had I done to elicit this reaction?
Now hold on, y'all, this is the beginning of our story
And I promise later on, it's gonna get gory
So parents, grab your kids, and tuck them off into bed
Because I think I might have killed the President!

[Verse 3]
One week later, I haven't seen the girl since
And I get to school and we're having a field trip
"Class participation is a must"
The sign said "Washington, D.C. or bust"
First thing on the agenda, the reflecting pool
And it made me remember that America's pretty cool
Then off to the White House for a special tour
Our guide was very knowledgeable in American folklore
She told us about Lincoln and George Washington
And even let us go into the room they smoke pipes in
"Time to go downstairs!" she called the elevator up
It arrived, I heard a DING! and felt my eyes shut
I awoke on the floor, the walls felt all curvy
I was soaking wet, and my stomach topsy-turvy
I was covered in blood, holding a knife - I dropped it
I looked around, I was in the Oval Office!

[Verse 4]
What had I done? I couldn't remember a thing!
But then some memories came back to me
I remember finding the president and stabbing him in the neck
Then cutting him into little pieces and stuffing him in his desk
Oh me! Oh my! I didn't mean to!
It must have been that hypnotist and his evil voodoo!
Now some things are bad, like not paying your rent
But I think I might have killed the president!

[Verse 5]
Well, it's been a year now since that fatal event
I framed a hobo to take the cops off my scent
And every time I hear a bell I stab someone in the face
But besides that I'd say that everything is going great!
Please learn from my story, don't be a fool
And never let a communist hypnotize you
Or you might... kill the president!
Out!

The best of everything - that's (that is) what I wish you all
The best of everything - a Rembrandt (hanging) on your (the) wall

A yacht that wins you cups
Skateboards with style and speed
Show dogs or loving pups
The pride of the pound or the pedigreed

I hope you win that prize - pass that blue ribbon test
I hope your good keeps getting better - 'til your better's best

With every wine you taste
With every song you sing
By now you may have guest
I hope you get the best of everything

[Verse 1]
Tell me if dreams do come true
If so, then I know that I'm losing you
And you know the address where we live
But I swear there'll be no turning back to you, I won't forgive

[Chorus]
When do I and when do I
Know if there's an answer why?
I wonder if I know where I fit in
How do I and how do I
Stop myself from gonna cry?
I wonder if I know where I fit in

[Verse 2]
Tell me if dreams do come true
If so then I know that I'm losing you
And you know the address where we live
But I swear there'll be no turning back to you
I won't forgive

[Chorus]
When do I and when do I
Know if there's an answer why?
I wonder if I know where I fit in
How do I and how do I
Stop myself from gonna cry?
I wonder if I know where I fit in
And when do I and when do I
When do I
When do I know if I fit in?
I can wait another day
Until I call you
You've only got my heart on a string
And everything a-flutter

But another lonely night
Might take forever
We've only got each other to blame
It's all the same to me, love
'Cause I know what I feel to be right

No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night, I'm always there

May I never miss the thrill
Of being near you
And if it takes a couple of years
To turn your tears to laughter
I will do what I feel to be right
No more lonely nights, never be another
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night, I'm always there
And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away

Yes, I know what I feel to be right

No more lonely nights, never be another
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night, I'm always there
And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away
And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away
No more lonely nights, no no
Summer, you old Indian Summer
You're the tear that comes after June-time's laughter
You see so many dreams that don't come true
Dreams we fashioned when Summertime was new

You are here to watch over
Some heart that is broken by a word that somebody left unspoken
You're the ghost of a romance in June going astray
Fading too soon, that's why I say
"Farewell to you, Indian Summer"

Extended sax solo

You are here to watch over
A heart that is broken by a word that somebody left unspoken
You're the ghost of a romance in June going astray
Fading too soon, that's why I say
"Farewell to you, Indian Summer"

You old Indian Summer

[Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
They call me The Wild Rose
But my name was Elisa Day
Why they call me it I do not know
For my name was Elisa Day

[Verse 1 : Chris Martin]
From the first day I saw her I knew she was the one
She stared in my eyes and smiled
For her lips were the colour of the roses
That grew down the river, all bloody and wild

[Verse 2 : Kylie Minogue]
When he knocked on my door and entered the room
My trembling subsided in his sure embrace
He would be my first man, and with a careful hand
He wiped at the tears that ran down my face

[Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
They call me The Wild Rose
But my name was Elisa Day
Why they call me it I do not know
For my name was Elisa Day

[Verse 3 : Chris Martin]
On the second day I brought her a flower
She was more beautiful than any woman I'd seen
I said, "Do you know where the wild roses grow
So sweet and scarlet and free?"

[Verse 4 : Kylie Minogue]
On the second day he came with a single red rose
Said: "Will you give me your loss and your sorrow"
I nodded my head, as I lay on the bed
He said, "If I show you the roses, will you follow?"

[Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
They call me The Wild Rose
But my name was Elisa Day
Why they call me it I do not know
For my name was Elisa Day

[Verse 5 : Kylie Minogue]
On the third day he took me to the river
He showed me the roses and we kissed
And the last thing I heard was a muttered word
As he knelt (stood smiling) above me with a rock in his fist

[Verse 6 : Chris Martin]
On the last day I took her where the wild roses grow
And she lay on the bank, the wind light as a thief
And I kissed her goodbye, said, "All beauty must die"
And lent down and planted a rose between her teeth

[Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
They call me The Wild Rose
But my name was Elisa Day
Why they call me it I do not know
For my name was Elisa Day
Aah, Backstreet
Yes yes y'all
One time, here we go (yes yes y'all)
Ooh, ooh (2X)
Yes yes y'all
I could tell when I stepped in the room
And I saw you standing there
And about by the way that you moved
I couldn't help the way I stared
There were some mysterious force
Leading me here to you
Lead me (lead me) to you (to you)
So I stood there watching
And I was hypnotised
By the rhythm of your body
And the music in your eyes
And I was lost in your world with you
Ooh, ooh, ooh...

Chorus:
Hey Mr. DJ keep playin' this song for me
Out on the floor in my arms, she's gotta be
Let's get it on (let's get it on)
Jam all night long
Mr. DJ, Mr. DJ
Will you play it for me?
Ooh, ooh (2X) (yes yes y'all)
Now it feels like it could be romance
As we dance across the floor
Every move that your body makes
Only makes me want you more
And it seems like time's moving fast
How can we make it last?
Make it (make it) last (last, so long)
As we keep on dancing
I am hypnotised
By the rhythm of your body
And the music in your eyes
Ooh, ooh...
Chorus
Close your eyes
And imagine us alone
Let the music put you in the zone
I am lost, lost inside a rhythm
When you do the things you do
Come on and work your body, work your body
Hey Mr. DJ, jam all night long
Hey Mr. DJ play that song for me
(2X)
Chorus to fade
Keep it coming Mr. DJ... (repeat to fade)

[Verse 1:]
You're there to pick me up

Sometimes her pride is like a big tall building
It hides the street that leads 2 a sweet mystery
(Sometimes) Sometimes we blow the chance 2 be so happy (Happy)
If we could only make up our minds
We could have such a good time

I know she wants me (Neon telephone)
I know she cares (I don't care)
Tell me what's stoppin' me (I don't care 2 know)

I'm goin' crazy, yes I am (Neon telephone)
Why can't U understand? (He needs 2 change)
I can't stop (can't stop) thinkin' about U, baby
This time I'm gonna lose my mind (This time I'm gonna lose it)

Why can't U call me, baby? Pick up the phone
U know your little Prince can't be alone
I need some of your sweet, sweet... oooh!

(Neon telephone)

Can't you feel me, babe; oh baby
(My secret lover)
Can't you feel me, baby? I love you, girl; la da da da da da
(My secret lover)
My mystery girl
(My secret lover)
You're my secret lover
(My secret lover)
I don't feel as if I know you
You take up all my time
The days are long and the nights will throw you away
Coz the sun don't shine
Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play

We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
Cos the years are falling by like the rain
And it's never gonna be the same
'Til the life I knew comes to my house and says
Hello!

There ain't no sense in feeling lonely
They got no faith in you
But I've got a feeling you still owe me

So wipe the shit from your shoes
Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play
We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
Cos the years are falling by like the rain
And it's never gonna be the same
'Til the life I knew comes to my house and says
Hello!
Hello! Says it's good to be back, good to be back!
Hello!
Hello! Says it's good to be back, good to be back!
Hello!
Hello! Says it's good to be back, good to be back!

Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Coconut woman is calling out
And everyday you can hear her shout
Coconut woman is calling out
And everyday you can hear her shout
Get your coconut water, four for five
Man it's good for your daughter, four for five
Coco got a lotta iron, four for five
Make you strong like a lion, four for five

A lady tell me the other day
No one can take her sweet man away
I ask her what was the mystery
She say coconut water and rice curry
You can cook it in a pot, four for five
You can serve it very hot, four for five
Coco got a lotta iron, four for five
Make you strong like a lion, four for five

Coconut woman says you'll agree
Coconut make very nice candy
The thing that's best if you're feelin' glum
Is coconut water with a little rum
It could make you very tipsy, four for five
Make you feel like a gypsy, four for five
Coco got a lotta iron, four for five
Make you strong like a lion, four for five

[Verse 1]
I was wrong to let you walk right out of my life
I was dumb to think that I could survive
Was a fool to think the grass was greener on the other side
Now it hurts to know that it means that I...

[Chorus]
I'll never love again (Never, never)
I'll never love again (Never, never)
I'll never love again (Never, never)
I'll never love again (Never, never)
Hey, hey
I'll never find nobody who can love me like you do
I'll never find nobody to treat me the way you do
I'll never find nobody else babe, hey
I'll never fall in love again, eh

[Verse 2]
I was stupid to think that any love could compare
To the love that you gave to me from you
Was a fool, yes a fool to think that I'd find anywhere
Anyone is better for me then you..

[Chorus]
I'll never love again (Never, never)
I'll never love again (Never, never)
I'll never love again (Never, never)
I'll never love again (Never, never)
Hey, hey
I'll never find nobody who can love me like you do
I'll never find nobody to treat me the way you do
I'll never find nobody else babe, hey
I'll never fall in love again, eh

[Bridge](4x)
And now my heart is stone cold
Because you've gone, gone away (away), gone away (away)

Gone away (5x)

[Chorus]
I'll never love again (Never, never)
I'll never love again (Never, never)
I'll never love again (Never, never)
I'll never love again (Never, never)
Hey, hey
I'll never find nobody who can love me like you do
I'll never find nobody to treat me the way you do
I'll never find nobody else babe, hey
I'll never fall in love again, eh
I'll never find nobody who can love me like you do
I'll never find nobody to treat me the way you do
I'll never find nobody else babe, hey
I'll never fall in love again, eh
I'll never get over you
No I'll never get over you
I just can't ( ? )
( ? ) see her anymore
Whoah no no

It wasn't so long ago
That you told me you love me so
Then you went and said goodbye
And found another guy
I, i, i, i

I know someday
Somewhere I'll find
One love to take your place
One love to take your place

But in the meantime

I'll never get over you
No I'll never get over you
I just can't ( ? )
( ? ) see her anymore
Whoah no no

[Intro]
Wake-up
Wake-up, wake-up
Signs tell the time
You're wasting

Wake up
Wake-up, wake-up
Life you will find
Is changing

[A1]
O the city life
Endless confusion
Hanging on too tight
To this illusion

[B1]
I'm not what I appear to be
I couldn't take the honesty
It seemed to be
Too easy for reality

[A2]
O the city life
What have I come to?
Faces in the night
Friendly to fool you

[B2]
I always try to justify
The way I am and wonder why
I couldn't be
The same to you I am to me

[Break]
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up

[Unison saxophone and guitar solo: Mel Collins and Andrew Latimer]

[B3]
I'm not what I appear to be
I couldn't take the honesty
It seemed to be
Too easy for reality

[Outro]
Oh, the city life
(Picks you up, lets you down)
Oh, the city life
City life
Hello !
Farewell to these marshes
Hemmed in like a boar between arches
Her very lowness with a head in a sling
I'm truly sorry - it sounds like a wonderful thing

I said charles, don't you ever craze
To appear on the front of the daily mail
Blessed in your mother's bridal veil ?
Oh ...
And so, i checked all the registered historical facts
I was shocked into shame to discover
I am the 18th pale descendant
Of some old queen or other

Oh, has the world changed, or have i changed ?
Oh has the world changed, or have i changed ?

Some 9-year old tough who peddles drugs
I swear to god
I never even knew what drugs were
So, i broke into the palace
With a sponge and a rusty spanner
She said : "i know you, and you cannot sing"
I said : "that's nothing - you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But when you're tied to your mother's apron
No-one talk about ...

Past the pub who breaks your body
And the church who'll snatch your money
The queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb
Past the pub who wrecks your body
And the church - all they want is your money
The queen is dead, boys
You can trust me, boys

Life is very long, when you're lonely
Life is very long, when you're lonely
Need someone's hand to lead me through the night
I need someone's arms to hold and squeeze me tight
Now, when the night begins, whoa, I'm at an end
Because I need your love so bad

I need some lips to feel next to mine
Need someone to stand up - to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin'
And when the lights are low - and it's time to go
That's when I need your love so bad

So why don't you give it up, baby and bring it home to me
Or write it on a piece of paper, woman - so it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me - and stop drivin' me mad
Whoa, because I - I need your love so bad

Need a soft voice - just to talk to me at night
Don't want you to worry, baby
I know we can make everything alright
Listen to my plea, baby, come on bring it to me
'Cause I need - your love so bad
Baby, I need, I need - woman, I need your love so bad

[Verse 1]
When you refuse me
You confuse me
What makes you think I'll let you in again?
Think again my friend
Go on, misuse me and abuse me
I'll come out stronger in the end

[Chorus]
And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone?
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown?

[Verse 2]
You do not know how much this hurts me
To say these things that I don't want to say
But have to say them anyway
I would do anything to end your suffering
But you would rather walk away

[Chorus]
And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone?
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown?
I'll bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown

[Bridge]
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home

[Chorus]
And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone?
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown?
I'll bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown
And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone?
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown?
I'll bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown

[Outro]
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home

[Chorus]
Do you really wanna rock tonight
Come on come on come on come on
And if you feel that the vibe is right
Come on come on come on come on
Say you really wanna get your
Body on tonight (Come On)
We can dance if you wanna dance
All night come on come on

[Verse 1: Nathan & Wanya]
We can clear that floor tonight
And so much more tonight
I'm feeling so good
Wanna dance the night away, with you
Hey D.J. play my song
Wanna party all night long
If you feel what I'm feeling
Don't be scared to join in
Come on

[Chorus]
Do you really wanna rock tonight
Come on come on come on come on
And if you feel that the vibe is right
Come on come on come on come on
Say you really wanna get your
Body on tonight (Come On)
We can dance if you wanna dance
All night come on come on

[Verse 2: Shawn & Wanya]
Girl I've been peeping you
And you've been peeping me
Baby let's not waste anymore time
('Cause I know you want to)
Got real close to me
'Cause we felt so easy
The way you move your body
Looks so fine, fine (You got me hypnotized)
The way you look into my eyes
And how you wear your hair
And oh the stylish clothes you wear
When you walked in the room
I knew that it was on
And I hope that this feeling
Goes on and on, come on

[Chorus]
Do you really wanna rock tonight
Come on come on come on come on
And if you feel that the vibe is right
Come on come on come on come on
Say you really wanna get your
Body on tonight (Come On)
We can dance if you wanna dance
All night come on come on

[Bridge]
If you wanna dance
Come and take a chance
If you wanna dance with me
Do you wanna move
I can make you move
Do you wanna move with me, with me

[Chorus]
Do you really wanna rock tonight
Come on come on come on come on
And if you feel that the vibe is right
Come on come on come on come on
Say you really wanna get your
Body on tonight (Come On)
We can dance if you wanna dance
All night come on come on
Tonight I'm gonna make you a star
I'm gonna play you like my new guitar
I'll put some polish on your strings
I'll make you sing like an angel sings
Lay back and love it baby stand up and shout
'Cuz tonight you'll see what bein' a star's all about

One touch you tremble one more you'll moan
I'll show you something you've never learned at home
You'll see how good baby it all can be
I'll show you everything you need to see
I've got a feeling baby you'll go far
'Cuz tonight you'll see what bein' a star's all about

I'm gonna rock you a little while
And then we'll roll in a down-home style
If it gets funky we won't mind
We're gonna reach for whatever we can find
You're gonna play all my favorite songs
I'll show you right now where the beat belongs
Come step aboard my midnight flight
We're gonna ride babe till the mornin' light
And when the tour is at the end
We'll go back over everywhere we've been
You got the message baby now answer the call
Step into the spotlight and give it your all
Can you talk to me with your body, baby?
Can you tell me what I wanna hear?
Can you lay on me a good enough reason to cross the line?
Yeah, ho!
Yeah, ho!

Can you be my lover and still be my friend? (Can you be my friend?)
Can you stick with me till the bitter end? (The bitter end)
Can you lay on me a good enough reason to cross the line?
Yeah, ho! (Cross the line)

[Chorus]
The line, line - it's a happy step to make
It takes time, time - all is what it takes
The line, line - and soon your life is so much better
The water's so much better on the other side
Cross the line

Can you tolerate? Why am I not so free?
How I did the plan
Can you understand I'm a free man?
But will I stop the dam if I don't cross the line?
Yeah, ho!
Yeah, ho!
Ow!
Hey
Cross the line sugar, cross the line
Cross the line sugar, cross the line
Cross the line

[Chorus]
The line, line - it's a happy step to make
It takes time, time - all is what it takes
The line, line - and soon your life is so much better
The water's so much better on the other side
Cross the line

Cross the line

Cross the line sugar, cross the line
Cross the line sugar, cross the line
Cross the line sugar, cross the line

I want you to cross the line, hey!
Talk to me, say the things I wanna hear, oh!
Cross the line

Cross the line

Cross the line
Baby, baby, baby, can you make me cross the line?
Cross the line, sugar, cross the line
You know you got to cross the line!

Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on, help me stand
I try, I have need, I am whole
Through the door, through the shore
Precious Lord, I believe in your name
Only just a friend the love story begins
Now here's a happy ending to believe in
You're always there for me, now you're with me in my dreams
It's got me wondering if you ever dream of me
I don't wanna risk losing everything
But I'll take the chance and tell you what I'm thinking

Girl, you've been my best friend
Can we put this to bed then
Tonight's the night to cross the line
Baby won't you be mine
Not just my home girl
Time that I take you home girl
Tonight's the night to cross the line
Let me love you tonight

I ... I ... I ...

Kiss (kiss) kiss (kiss) kiss me on my lips
We've been dancin round the moment now we're doin it
Then breathe (breathe) breathe (breathe) a sigh of sweet relief
We been holding it so long the wait was killing me
Oh and we oh and we have been waiting for
So baby open your mind while I close the door
Oh girl
You've been my best friend
Can we put this to bed then
Tonight's the night to cross the line
Baby won't you be mine
Not just my home girl
Time that I take you home girl
Tonight's the night to cross the line
Let me love you night

I ... I ... I ...

Don't let this moment slip away
Cause we'll never know unless we try it someday
If you're ready I'm so ready
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night

Oh girl
You've been my best friend
Can we put this to bed then
Tonight's the night to cross the line
Baby won't you be mine
Not just my home girl
Time that I take you home girl
Tonight's the night to cross the line
Let me love you night
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble
Ancient footprints are everywhere
You can almost think that you're seein' double
On a cold dark night on the Spanish Stairs

Got to hurry on back to my hotel room
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece
She promised that she'd be right there with me
When I paint my masterpiece

Oh, the hours I've spent inside the Coliseum
Dodging lions and wastin' time
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle
I could hardly stand to see 'em
Yes, it sure has been a long hard climb

Train wheels runnin' thru the back of my memory
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
Someday, everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece
Sailin' 'round the world in a dirty gondola
Oh, to be back in the land of Coca-Cola!

I left Rome and landed in Brussels
On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pullin' muscles
Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside

Newspapermen eating candy
Had to be held down by big police
Someday, everything is gonna be diff'rent
When I paint my masterpiece
I may not always love you
But long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it
God only knows what i'd be without you
If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me
God only knows what i'd be without you
God only knows what i'd be without you
If you should ever leave me
Well life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me
God only knows what i'd be without you
God only knows what i'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what i'd be without you
God only knows what i'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what i'd be without you
God only knows what i'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what i'd be without you
God only knows what i'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what i'd be without you
God only knows what i'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what i'd be without you
God only knows what i'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what i'd be without you
I'll never forget you, but should I forget you
Then let my eyes forget that they have seen the day, my love
And let my ears not hear sweet children at their play, my love
And let my lips forget that they have learned to pray, my love
If I forsake you, if I forsake you
I'll never forget you, but should I forget you
Then may I ever know the bitter, not the sweet, my love
And may I never find a friendly hand to greet, my love
And let this heart of mine forget that it must beat, my love
If I forget, if I forget you

[Verse 1]
Out of the fire like Catholic saints
Comes Scarlett and her deep complaint
Mimicking tenderness she sees
In sentimental movies

[Verse 2]
A celluloid rider comes to town
Cinematic lovers sway
Plantations and sweeping ballroom gowns
Take her breath away

[Verse 3]
Out in the wind in crinolines
Chasing the ghosts of Gable and Flynn
Through stand-in boys and extra players
Magnolias hopeful in her auburn hair

[Verse 4]
She comes from a school of southern charm
She likes to have things her way
Any man in the world holding out his arm
Would soon be made to pay

[Verse 5]
Friends have told her not so proud
Neighbors trying to sleep and yelling "not so loud"
Lovers in anger "block of ice"
Harder and harder just to be nice

[Verse 6]
Given in the night to dark dreams
From the dark things she feels
She covers her eyes in the X-Rated scenes
Running from the reels

[Verse 7]
Beauty and madness to be praised
'Cause it is not easy to be brave
To walk around in so much need
To carry the weight of all that greed

[Verse 8]
Dressed in stolen clothes she stands
Cast iron and frail
With her impossibly gentle hands
And her blood-red fingernails

[Outro]
Out of the fire and still smoldering
She says "A woman must have everything"
Shades of Scarlett conquering
She says "A woman must have everything"

[Instrumental Intro]

[Outro]
You know you need it
Hey!
I need it too
Maybe I won't find
Any old love letters
Maybe I won't wish
You'd come down the hall
Maybe my picture frames
Won't look so empty
I have to take 'em down
Off the wall
Maybe the rain will come
After I'm sleeping
Maybe in my dreams
I won't feel this pain
Maybe I'll find my way
Back to morning
Without hearing whispers of your name
Maybe I'll find some things
To keep my mind busy
Maybe I'll sell this car
Sell this ol' ring
Maybe that'll be enough
To finally convince me
That you're not here
And I really don't have anything
Maybe I'll try
Try to get out some
Maybe our favorite places
Will still feel the same
Maybe when I sit alone
At our old table
I won't hear whispers of your name
I won't hear whispers of your name
Yeah, oh, yeah
Baby, wake up, yeah!
Girl, your phone been going crazy
Somebody acting real real foolish
And I know you're tired or way too lazy
To be waken up to all that bullshit
Yeah, let her go, let her go
She'd be with me, she didn't worry about you, you
I wanna call and let you know, let you know
So you won't think it came out of blue

Man, I hope yall break up
You'll be calling in the middle of the night
I'm listening to both of yall fight
Making me to wake up, yeah
Please tell me what's the use
She ain't even try to find an excuse
To make up, oh, oh
And I really think she don't care anymore
So man to man you're stupid
And I'm like man
You should have known what she was doing
Yall need to breakup, oh, oh
Yall need to break up, oh, oh!
Yall need to break up!
I've been sitting here watching her getting stressed out
Cause you've been claiming that she was cheating on you
Man, and if you think about it
You really pushed her to do what she do

Cause man, I hope you break up
You'll be calling in the middle of the night
I'm listening to yall fight
Making me to wake up, yeah
Please tell me what's the use
She didn't try to find an excuse
To make up, oh, oh
And I really think she don't care anymore
So man to man you're stupid
And I'm like man
You should have known what she was doing
You need to breakup, oh, oh
You need to break up, oh, oh!
You need to break up!
I can't wait until you break up
She's gonna be mine when you break up
You want me to leave, you want me to stay
You ask me to come back, then you turn and walk away
You wanna be lovers, then you wanna be friends
I'm losin' my patience, you're nearin' the end

One of these days you're gonna reach out and find
The one that you count on has left you behind
Don't wanna be no mother, you know I'm no saint
Oh my, my baby, before it's too late

Treat me right, treat me right, open your eyes, maybe you'll see the light

Do you think I'm a fool, well you'd better think twice
I've had enough, baby, it's time you realize
That you can't have it both ways, that's no way to live
You've done all the takin', it's your turn to give

One of these days you're gonna reach out and find
The one that you count on has left you behind
Don't wanna be no mother, you know I'm no saint
Oh my, my baby, before it's too late
Treat me right, treat me right
Open your eyes, maybe you'll see the light, oh, treat me right

You want me to leave, you want me to stay
You ask me to come back, you turn and walk away
You wanna be lovers, then you wanna be friends
I'm losin' my patience, you're nearin' the end

Treat me right, treat me right
Open your eyes, maybe you'll see the light, oh, treat me right

Treat me right, treat me right
Treat me right, treat me right
What are they seeing when they look in each other's eyes?
What are they feeling when they see each other's smile?
Is it a love I've never known or an emotion that I've outgrown?

Did I take a wrong turnin' on life's winding road?
Won't somebody help me find the, find the right way to go?
My life need some correction, alteration in direction
Won't someone come with me for a while, for a while, yes, yes I'm lost

What is the secret of this tie that binds
Two souls in communion, both body and mind
Is it special magic or just the nature of things?
Conceived of great spirit, not for beggars but kings

You who have found it, please help me along
I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm not, I'm not made out of stone
My needs they are simple, I don't want many things
But I truly want to fly on them wings of love one more time

That's all I need
I wanna fly on them wings
I wanna fly on them wings of love
I'm a stranger here
Won't somebody help me now
I wake up early in the morning
You know, you know, you know my pillow gets soaking wet
All I need, all I need

That's to fly on them wings
I'm in love one more time
I'm a stranger in your town
Don't 

[Incomprehensible] on them wings

[Verse 1: David Ruffin and (Melvin Franklin)]
The sun is shining (Oh yeah)
There's plenty of light
A new day is dawning
Sunny and bright
But after I've been crying all night
The sun is cold
And the new day seems old

[Chorus: David Ruffin & (The Temptations)]
Since I lost my baby
(Since I lost my baby)
Oh, since I lost my baby
(Since I lost my baby)

[Verse 2: David Ruffin and (The Temptations)]
The birds are singing
And the children are playing (Doo-doo-doo)
There's plenty of work
And the bosses are paying
Not a sad word should
A young heart be saying
But fun is a bore
And with money I'm poor

[Chorus: David Ruffin & (The Temptations)]
Since I lost my baby
(Since I lost my baby)
Oh, since I lost my baby
(Since I lost my baby)

[Bridge: David Ruffin & (The Temptations)]
Next time I'll be kinder
(Next time I'll be kinder)
Won't you please help me find her
(Won't you please help me find her)
Someone just remind her
(Someone just remind her)
Of this love she left behind her
(Of this love she left behind her)
'Til I find her I'll be trying
('Til I find her I'll be trying)
Every day I'm more inclined to find her
Inclined to find her
(Inclined to find my baby)
Been looking everywhere (Baby)
Baby, I really, really care

[Verse 3: David Ruffin & (The Temptations)]
Oh, determination is fading fast (Oh yeah)
Inspiration is a thing of the past (Oh yeah)
Can't see how my hope's gonna last
Good things are bad
And what's happy is sad

[Chorus: David Ruffin & (The Temptations)]
Since I lost my baby
(Since I lost my baby)
Oh, since I lost my baby
(Since I lost my baby)

[Outro: David Ruffin & (The Temptations)]
I feel so bad (Since I lost my baby)
I feel so sad (Since I lost my baby)
Everything is wrong (Since I lost my baby)
This heart is hard to carry on (Since I lost my baby)
I'm lost as can be (Since I lost my baby)
What's gonna happen to me?
What'll I do
When you are far away
And I am blue
What'll I do?

What'll I do
When I am wondering who
Is kissing you
What'll I do?

What'll I do
With just a photograph
To tell my troubles too?

When I'm alone
With only dreams of you
That won't come true...

What'll I do?

What'll I do
With just a photograph
To tell my troubles too?
When I'm alone
With only dreams of you
That won't come true...

What'll I do?
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Well I gave you everything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me oh so bad
All I do is hang my head and moan
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
If there's something I have said or done
Tell me what and I'll apologise
If you don't really can't go on
Holding back these tears in my eyes
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Well I beg you on my bended knees
If you'll only listen to my pleas
Is there anything I can do
Cos I really can't stand it, I'm so in love with you
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
(Marc Cohn)

Don't know much about you
Don't know who you are
We've been doin' fine without you
But we could only go so far
Don't know why you chose us
Were you watching from above
Is there someone there that knows us
Said we'd give you all our love

Will you laugh just like your mother
Will you sigh like your old man
Will some things skip a generation
Like I've heard they often can

Are you a poet or a dancer
A devil or a clown
Or a strange new combination of
The things we've handed down
I wonder who you'll look like
Will your hair fall down and curl
Will you be a Mama's boy
Or Daddy's little girl
Will you be a sad reminder
Of what's been lost along the way
Maybe you can help me find her
In the things you do and say

And these things that we have given you
They are not so easily found
Oh, but you can thank us later for
The things we've handed down
The things we've handed down
Down,down,down,down,down

You may not always be so grateful
For the way that you were made
Maybe some feature of your father's
That you'd gladly sell or trade
And one day you may look at us
And say that you were cursed
But over time that line has been
Extremely well rehearsed

By our fathers and their fathers
In some old and distant town
From places no one here remebers
Come
The things we've handed down
The things we've handed down, down
The things we've handed down
Jessie went away last summer, couple of months ago
After all our time together it was hard to see her go
She called me right up when she arrived asked me one more time to come
Livin' on a LA freeway ain't my kind of havin' fun

I think I'd rather be a cowboy
I think I'd rather ride a range
I think I'd rather be a cowboy
Than to lay me down in love and lady's chains

We were just beginning, it was such an easy way
Layin' backup in the mountains makin' songs for sunny days
She got tired of pickin' daisies and cookin' my meals for me
She can live the life she wants to, yes, and it's all right with me

I think I'd rather be a cowboy
I think I'd rather ride a range
I think I'd rather be a cowboy
Than to lay me down in love and lady's chains

I'd rather live on the side of a mountain
Than wander through the canyons of concrete and steel
I'd rather laugh with the rain and sunshine
And lay down my sundown in some starry field
Oh, but I miss her in the mornin' when I awake alone
The absence of her laughter is a cold and empty sound
But her memory always makes me smile and I want you to know
I love her, yes I love her, just enough to let her go

I think I'd rather be a cowboy
I think I'd rather ride a range
I think I'd rather be a cowboy
Than to lay me down in love and lady's chains
I think I'd rather be a cowboy
I think I'd rather ride a range
I think I'd rather be a cowboy
Than to lay me down in love 

[and] lady's chains
I don't have to know your name
Unless you really want me too
All I really want to know
Is what you want to do
Hope there's something you like
In something that you see
I don't have that much to say for me

I've always been lonely
But don't be afraid
I've always been lonely
Like a song never played
I've always been lonely
But if you come with me tonight
And stayed
At least we'd know
It wasn't loneliness we made

You don't have to know my past
It's much too much for me and you
If the sadness has to show
I guess I'll let it through
We can go till it's gone
And give it all we've got
Sometimes anything can mean a lot
After all the jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering down the street
Footprints dressed in red
And the wind it screams mary

A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broke pieces of yesterdays life
Says Somewhere a queen is weeping
And Somewhere a king has no wife
And the wind it whispers Mary

The traffic lights turn blue tomorrow
And shine emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags on down the stream
'cause the life that lived is dead
And the wind it screams Mary
And the wind it cries Mary

Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past
With its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
It whispers "no, this won't be the last"
And the wind cries Mary
And the wind cries Mary
I like this picture in the moonlight
It just fell straight into my eyes
I could not stop myself from dreaming
As she appeared there by disguise

I go up and down now
I can feel the heat wave
I can't stop to face my freedom
With my dreams

Can't you feel my love?
(And I don't know how to say it)
Whoa
(And I don't know what to do)
Can't you feel my love?
(And I don't know how to say it)
Whoa
(Don't know how to get to you)

Came into the situation
I think 'bout starting an affair
But that should be a big frustration
'Cause there is something in the air
I go up and down now
I can feel the heat wave
I can't stop to face my freedom
With my dreams

Can't you feel my love?
(And I don't know how to say it)
Whoa
(And I don't know what to do)
Can't you feel my love?
(And I don't know how to say it)
Whoa
(Don't know how to get to you)

Believe me, I don't wanna hurt you
Don't lose your spare time over me
But I'm in love, can I be rescued?
And can't you hurry to set me free?

I go up and down now
I can feel the heat wave
I can't stop to face my freedom
With my dreams

Can't you feel my love?
Oh
Can't you feel my love?
(And I don't know how to say it)
Oh
(Don't know how to get to you)
Nashville tears are lonely signs that point to broken hearts
Broken lives and families that love has split apart
Children who miss daddy, mommy's on the run
The pleasure that is painful and hidden from the sun

Nashville hearts are lonely words that speak of love gone wrong
Sad and soulful stories and beautiful love songs
For each and every melody of happiness denied
You know that there's another one that shows the other side

Country love is kisses in the kitchen
Country love is honest and it's true
Country love is home with your family
County love's the way that I love you

Country love is silky nights and warm familiar hands
Someone who's been there before and always understands

Nashville nights are lonely roads that we've all travelled on
Sometimes they take you far away or they can bring you home
If you're lost out on the highway, do not deny the dove
When Nashville night's the question, the answer's country love
Country love is kisses in the kitchen
Country love is honest and it's true
Country love is home with your family
County love's the way that I love you

Country love is kisses in the kitchen
Country love is honest and it's true
Country love is home with your family
County love's the way that I love you
Take my love, hold me tight
Take my love, share this night
Share my lips, share my heart
Say that we'll never part

Take my love, hold me tight
In its thrill find delight
Let each kiss build a dream
Let our love be its theme

True love begs for your hand
Mine is the true love
My anxious heart await your command

Take my love, hold me tight
Take my love, say it's right
Say that you feel as I
Say we'll love till we die

True love begs for your hand
Mine is the true love
My anxious heart await your command
Take my love, hold me tight
Take my love, say it's right
Say that you feel as I
Say we'll love till we die

Take my love

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]
Touch me, baby
Give me what I desire, yeah
Love me, honey
All through the night
Girl, I think I've fallen in love with you again, baby

Forever without an end
Without an end, baby

[Chorus: Ronald Isley, The Isley Brothers]

(Keep touching me, baby)
(Baby) Ooh
(Keep touching me, baby)
(Baby) Love me, girl
(Keep touching me, baby)
All over and over and over and over
(Baby) Baby
(Keep touching me, baby)
Would you do that for me?
(Baby) You see I like it
(Keep touching me, baby)
I like it, I like it, ooh, I like it, baby

[Outro: The Isley Brothers]
Baby
Keep touching me, baby
Baby
Keep touching me, baby

Keep touching me, baby
It was twenty years ago today
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to break a smile
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

I don't really want to stop the show
But I think you might like to know
That the singer's gonna to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along
So may I introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Choices that we make in life
May take us far
Chances that we take tonight
May lead us into darken places
But at the end of Godly choices
Are higher dreams
But in the game of chance
Theres only a guilty wave or stream
Sometimes I don't know which road I should take
Sometimes I don't know which move I should make

But it's only if God says yes
I'll make my move
And it's only if God says yes
Then I will choose
For it's only if God would just
Bow his head
Then I will do it
Thats what I will do

I started down the right road
Only to end up wrong
The endless journey carried me so far away
From my home and family
But I'm learning I was never meant to go alone
Neither was it meant for me to go on my own no
Sometimes I don't know which road I should take
Sometimes I don't know which move I should make
I'll never go on my own
I'll never go all alone

Sometimes I don't know which road I should take
Sometimes I don't know which move I should make

But it's only if God says yes
I'll make my move
For it's only if God says yes
Then I will choose
For it's only if God would just answer me
And it's only if God would just hear my plead
And it's only if God would just bow his head
Then I will do it
That's what I will do

That's what I will do
Yeah yeah yeah...

I was born in Lil' Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I wore hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pigtails
I know I loved her even then
You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boo-hooed it
But I told them time and time again
"Don't you know I was made to love her
Built my whole world around her"
Yah! Hey, hey, hey

She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossmed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years
I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey
All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby
Ahhh!

My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere
I was knee high to a chicken
When the love bug bit me, yeah
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there
'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ah, I was made to love her
Built my whole world around her
Hey, hey, hey

Ooh baby, I was made to please her
You know daddy ain't gonna leave her, no
Hey, hey, hey

My baby loves me
My baby needs me, yeah, oh yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh wee, I was made to love her
And I know she was made to love me too
Yeah yeah yeah

Oh oh oh, oh, yeah yeah yeah
See I was made to love her
Built my whole world around her
Yeah yeah yeah

Oh baby, oh baby, yeah yeah yeah...

[Verse 1]
So bold and fine, I′ve known you for some time
Whole life changed while bones like yours and mine
Go dance in the woods and down we go, down, down

Oh boy, you're mine, do you remember old times?

[Chorus]
Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You′re a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too
Oh, dear boy, I'm hollow without you
In a world with everything, but it won't do
Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You′re a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too
Oh, dear boy, it′s so hollow in the blue
It's a chance, boy, everything and I can know you

[Verse 2]
Old love of mine, destruction ain′t a crime
For those who find love as a game, like you and I
Go dance in the waters of all the tears we've cried
Oh boy, we′re fine, do you remember our time?

[Chorus]
Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too
Oh, dear boy, it′s so hollow in the blue
It's the time for everything and I found you
Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too
Oh, dear boy, it′s so hollow in the blue
If you down, boy, everything and I can know you
My grandfather's clock was too tall for the shelf
So it stood ninety years on the floor
It was taller by half than the old man himself
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more
It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born
And was always his treasure and pride
But it stopped short never to go again when the old man died
Ninety years without slumbering his life second's numbering
It stopped short never to go again when the old man died
My grandfather said that of those he could hire
Not a servant so faithful he found
For it wasted no time and had but one desire
At the close of each week to be wound
And it kept in its place not a frown upon its face
And its hands never hung by its side
But it stopped short never to go again when the old man died
It rang and alarmed in the dead of the night
An alarm that for years had been dumb
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight
That his hour for departure had come
Still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime
As we silently stood by his side
But it stopped short never to go again when the old man died
Ninety years without slumbering...
So I walked a little too fast, and I drive a little too fast
And I'm reckless it's true, but what else can you do
At the end of a love affair?
So I talk a little too much, and I laugh a little too much
And my voice is too loud when I'm out in a crowd
So that people are apt to stare
Do they know, do they care
That it's only that I'm lonely, and low as can be
And the smile on my face isn't really a smile at all
So I smoke a little too much, and I drink a little too much
And the tunes I request are not always the best
But the ones where the trumpets blare
So I go at a maddening pace
And I pretend that it's taking her place
But what else can you do at the end of a love affair?

So I smoke a little too much, and I drink a little too much
And the tunes I request are not always the best
But the ones where the trumpets blare
So I go at a maddening pace
And I pretend that it's taking her place
But what else can you do at the end of a love affair?

[Intro]
This song goes out to my mother
The one I love and the one I lost
When it comes down to thinking about what my mother's done for me, the love she's given me
It makes it easy to do a song like this
So this one's for you ma, I love you

[Verse 1]
Early one Sunday morning
Breakfast was on the table
There was no time to eat
She said to me, "Boy, hurry to Sunday school"
Filled with the long of glory
We learned the holy story
She'll always have her dreams
Despite the things
This troubled world can bring

[Chorus]
Oh Sadie, don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie
Place no one above you, sweet Sadie
Well, well, well
Living in the past
Sometimes it seems so funny
No money can turn your life around

[Verse 2]
Sweeter than cotton candy
Stronger than papas' old Brandy
Always that needed smile
Once in a while she would break down and cry
Sometimes she'd be so happy
Being with us and daddy
Standing the worst of times
Breaking the binds with just a simple song

[Chorus]
Oh Sadie, she's loving my song in a special way
Sweet Sadie, living in the past
Oh, she's never sinning in love she's always winning
My my my my my
I love you mama
I just can't forget how you gave me love oh no
If there's a heaven up above, I know she's teaching angels how to love
It's a mean world without ya
And I surely miss you much mother
And now that your gone I'm gonna carry on
'Cause you're crying lady
Ooh Sadie
When I think about the things that you done for me
Hey it brings a joy way down deep inside of me

[Outro]
Oh oh oh oo oh
See I love you mama
Yes I do
I'll never forget you mama no
Oh oh oh
Are you going to Scarborough Fair
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She was once a true love of mine

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Without no seams nor needle work
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to find me an acre of land
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Between the salt water and the sea strands
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Are you going to Scarborough Fair
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She was once a true love of mine

Hey Jamaica

Peas and rice
They are awful nice
But not as nice as you
Peas and rice
They are awful nice
But not as nice as you
Peas and rice
They are awful nice
But not as nice as you
...
I played a weddin' for the money and I wished I could have told the bride and groom
Just what I think of marriage and what's in store after the honeymoon
And I was rumblin' through the verses 'bout how men and women ought to live apart
And how a promise never made could not be broken and could never break a heart

Suddenly from out of nowhere, this little girl came spinnin' across the floor
And all her crinolines were billowing beneath the skirt of calico she wore
As her joy fell on the honored guests, each one of them was draw into her dream
And they laughed and stamped and clapped their hands and hollered at her, "Dance Little Jean"

And they said, "Dance Little Jean this day is for you
Two people that ya love stood up to say, 'I do'"
"Dance Little Jean a prayer that ya had
Was answered today your mamma's marryin' your dad"

Well, this cynic's heart just melted as I figur'd what this get together meant
And how it ended years of tears and sad confusion that the little girl had spent
They told the band to pack it up about time the couple cut the cake
But we stayed and we played all night long for love and laughs and Little Jeanie's sake

And we played "Dance Little Jean this day is for you
Two people that you love stood up to say, 'I do'"
"Dance Little Jean a prayer that ya had
Was answered today your mamma's marryin' your dad"
We said "Dance Little Jean this day is for you
Two people that you love stood up to say, 'I do'"
"Dance Little Jean a prayer that ya had
Was answered today your mamma's marryin' your dad"

[Verse 1]
Watch the sunrise
Say your goodbyes
Off we go
Some conversation
No contemplation
Hit the road

[Verse 2]
Car overheats
Jump out of my seat
On the side of the highway, baby
Our road is long
Your hold is strong
Please don't ever let go, oh no

[Chorus]
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh no, they can't

[Verse 3]
I'm driving fast now
Don't think I know how to go slow
Oh, where you at now?
I feel around
There you are

[Verse 4]
Cool these engines
Calm these jets
I ask you how hot can it get
And as you wipe off beads of sweat
Slowly you say "I'm not there yet!"

[Chorus]
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh no, they can't

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh no, they can't
I have a girlfriend
She says I'm her only one
We wanna get married
But we're so young
So young
Can't marry no one
They say our love is
Just a teenage affection
But no one knows
Our hearts' direction

So young
Can't marry no one
I'm I'm I'm so young
I'm I'm I'm so young
I'm I'm I'm so young
Can't marry no one, no one

Pretty soon now
I'll go to sea
Their mother's baby
Will have seen the last of me
So young
Can't marry no one, no one
Can't marry no one
Can't marry no one
Can't marry no one
Can't marry no one
Can't marry no one
Can't marry no one
I haven't seen all there is to see
But I've seen quite a bit
Some things I'll always remember
Some things I wish that I could forget
I haven't quite been around the world
But I've been around the block
I know that distances are meaningless
Like the hands that move around a clock
And I know that love is everywhere
Always safe, always true
And exactly where it comes from
Is where it's going to

Your heart to mine
My heart to yours
Talk about opening windows
Talk about opening doors
My heart to yours
Your heart to mine
Love is a light that shines
From heart to heart
Here I am sitting in old Hong Kong
The harbor and the lights
They're like diamonds in the heavens
Enough to brighten the darkest of nights
There's another side to sorrow
As there is to everything
Like the other side of lonely
Is falling in love again
And then you know that there's an answer
To the suffering we see
And though it isn't easy
It's still as simple as you and me
And you'll know that love is everywhere
Always safe, always true
And exactly where it comes from
Is where it's going to

Your heart to mine
My heart to yours
Talk about opening windows
Talk about opening doors
My heart to yours
Your heart to mine
Love is a light that shines
From heart to heart
Your heart to mine
My heart to yours
Talk about opening windows
Talk about opening doors
My heart to yours
Your heart to mine
Love is a light that shines
From heart to heart

[Verse 1]
Here I am lovin' you
You're like a dream come true
For so long I've waited for this time
Girl. what you mean to me
In reality, you're all I ever hoped for
You will always be more than right for me
Each day I'll love you more

[Chorus]
Well, what it comes down to
(What it comes down to, what it comes down to)
This is all I want from you
(What it comes down to, ooh, ooh)
Yeah, same you want from me that can only be
Love and understanding
For what we have at stake, a little give and take
It's better than demanding

[Verse 2]
Why do we stay together?
Talkin' about you and me
You got your reasons, I got mine
Oh, if it had to be, one and only me
Sure would be a drag now
Need somebody who, needs somebody to
Keep from bein' sad now

[Chorus]
Well, what it comes down to
(What it comes down to, what it comes down to)
This is all I want from you
(What it comes down to, ooh, ooh)
Same you want from me that can only be
Love and understanding
What we have at stake, a little give and take
It's better than demanding
Hey

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Ah, what it comes down to
(What it comes down to, what it comes down to)
This is all I want from you
(What it comes down to, ooh, ooh)
Same you want from me that can only be
Love and understanding
What we have at stake, a little give and take
It's better than demanding

[Outro]
Well, what it comes down to
That's all I want, baby
What it comes down to
That's all I want from you (Oh, oh)
What it comes down to
That's all I want, baby, hey, hey, hey
What it comes down to
That's all I want, baby, oh oh
What it comes down to
That's all I want from you
What it comes down to
That's all I want, baby
What it comes down to
That's all I want from you
What it comes down to
That's all I want from you
Ridin' on a tradewind
Fillin' my sails with a soft and southerly breeze
Livin' on the ocean blue

Dreaming' of the islands
Rappin' myself in the glow of a tropical moon
I never shiver when the sun goes down

All the Earth she sings to me
Every shallow, every tree
Surely my loves shining like the sea

I can make you happy
If I can I'll take you away on a wave in my arms
Never leave you on the edge all alone

If you feel like dancin'
Rollin' like the water across my sleepless night
Makin me a peaceful place

All my life to be with you
All I ever want to do
Knowing you are feeling that way too
Distant thunder, heavy seas
Rocky Mountain memories
Surely I was lost till I found thee

Ye Ye Ye

[Chorus]
Suddenly you came on to me
Was it wrong for you to belong to me?
Maybe we can find a way
Everyday is like a dream to me

[Verse 1]
You said I need a place to go
So we said lets go
I let you out of my sight
But you were stir-crazy
Looking for the next best thing
To fight is your escape route, and so is mine
It was the best thing for you and me to unite
No matter where we go the winds still blow
Cause matters of the heart always lead you from the start

[Chorus]
Suddenly you came on to me
Was it wrong for you to belong to me?
Maybe we can find a way
Everyday is like a dream to me

[Verse 2]
Another day, another show
And the wind just blows, In and out of my life
You think I'm crazy cause all I want to do is relive the day that I first met you
Was right on time, It was a bright day and you were like a heavenly sign
At the end of our tale, the loneliness prevails

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Suddenly you came on to me
Was it wrong for you to belong to me?
Maybe we can find a way
Everyday is like a dream to me

[Outro]
It's plain to see for you and me, love
It can't hold on, just be who you are
We were always sweethearts
Different in our ways
Together we spent happy hours
And oh happy days
Laughing in the sunshine
And crying in the rain
Together we knew happy days
We never knew no pain... yeah

Cloudy day
Sunny sunshine
Happy days will never be the same

I was her man
And she my queen
Together we knew happy days honestly
Lying in the grass
And laying on our butts.. yeah yeah

We were always different
Different in our ways
Together we knew happy hours
And oh happy ways
Lying out together
And never mind the weather
Together we knew happy days
We never had it better.. yeah
Cloudy days
Sunny sunshine
Happy days will never be the same
No no no no no
Aaah.. get it

Oh times can be
So hard you'll see
Never never know in stormy weather
Times can be
So hard to be
Never never knowing we´re together... yeah
Mmmm

We were always sweethearts
Different in our ways
Together we spent happy hours
And oh happy days
Laughing in the sunshine
And crying in the rain
Together we knew happy days
We never knew no pain.. yeah

Cloudy days
Sunny sunshine
Happy days will never be the same
Na, na, na, na, na na yeah...
Na, na, na, na, na na yeah...
Na, na, na, na, na na yeah....
Spoken:
Wherever we may be along about this time of year, our hearts become sentimental pilgrims and head for home. Because home is where we all discover that Christmas is one time of the year when we don't have to be wealthy to be rich. Some of us remember Christmas as the time when Dad gave us our first gold watch. Others remember it as the time when a charity organization delivered a Christmas basket to the doorstep before dawn, so the neighbors wouldn't see and Mother wouldn't be embarrassed. But whether the hearth that cheered your family was a fireplace of marble or a kitchen stove of cast iron, you'll remember that your home was the richest place on earth, warmed by the richest spirit on earth, the spirit of Christmas. And that's why I've chosen this next song to sing as a Christmas song. It's not a carol, it's just a beautiful pathway of friendly and understanding music up which our hearts may travel as they make their Yuletide pilgrimage goin' home

Goin' home, goin' home
I'm a'goin' home
Quiet-like, some still day
I'm a'goin' home

It's not far, just close by
Through an open door
Work all done, care laid by
Goin'ta fear no more

Mother's there, 'spectin' me
Father's waitin', too
Lots of folks gathered there
All the friends I knew

Spoken:
One of the most precious gifts we have throughout the year is one we often forget, the precious gift of freedom. Freedom to work, to play, to worship as we please. Freedom to decided how we'll handle our own future, 'cause we can make our future and that of our families a secure one though saving. We can buy Savings Bonds to take care of that new home or an education for our kids. No one says we hafta buy 'em, we wanna buy 'em, 'cause they're not only an investment in our own future, they're an investment in the finest country in the world. So let me urge you sincerely, as we look toward a new year, to plan for making it a secure year, for the regular purchase of US Savings Bonds. So long, everybody, and Merry Christmas

I think I, I think I, think I wanna file the nails
And I, that's good, quit now, quit
Let's get the hell outta here
I'm a good man
In a dark room
In a big town
Under a full moon
It's a friday and I'm almost home

I'm in a good place
Full of head space
Got a brand new pack in my suitcase
But it's dinner and then it's bed alone
How do you break a mended heart?
I'm bored and want something to do

I wanna fall, fall asleep
Asleep in the arms, the arms of a woman
A woman who doesn't, doesn't deserve my love

I wanna lie, lie to myself
Myself and someone else
Just to feel something, something that hurts me
The hurt makes me feel alive
Gonna make it, like I need her
Gonna miss her the moment I meet her
And it's only gonna get worse from there

I'll be rappin' there in the shower
She'll be here by the end of the hour
I can do better
But I can't do better now

How do you break a mended heart?
I'm bored and want something to do

I wanna fall, fall asleep
Asleep in the arms, the arms of a woman
A woman who doesn't, doesn't deserve my love

I wanna lie, lie to myself
Myself and someone else
Just to feel something, something that hurts me
The hurt makes me feel alive

So long is over
Nice to skip the chance you get to know you
Why did I think this was true?
Because I want to
I wanna fall, fall asleep
Asleep in the arms, the arms of a woman
A woman who doesn't, doesn't deserve my love

I wanna lie, lie to myself
Myself and someone else
Just to feel something, something that hurts me
The hurt makes me feel alive

I wanna fall
I wanna need
I wanna laugh, cry, say goodbye
Beg, lie, cheat and steal

[Verse 1]
I need a camera
To my eye
To my eye, reminding
Which lies have I been hiding
Which echoes belong

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm counting out
The days in Central Park
With gravel in my heart
With echoes in my palm

[Chorus]
Phone my family
Tell 'em I'm lost on the sidewalk
And no, it's not okay

[Verse 2]
I smashed a camera
I wanna know why
To my eyes, reminding
Which lies have I been hiding
Which echoes belong

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm counting on
The days to see how far
I've driven in the dark
With gravel in my heart

[Chorus]
Phone my family
Tell 'em I'm lost on the sidewalk
And no, it's not okay

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm counting on
Those days in Central Park
With echoes in my heart
With gravel in my palm

[Chorus]
Phone my family
Tell 'em I'm lost on the sidewalk
And no it's not okay
No, it's not okay
No, it's not okay
Aye What's Happenin'
All you haters should get at me cause I hear ya and
I'm watchin' but I'm serious haters so all I gotta say is

[Chorus]
What up, what's happenin'
All u haters can get at me (hey)
Cause I hear ya and I'm watchin' (hey)
But I'm still here I ain't stoppin'
So What up, what's happenin'
All u haters should get at me
Cause I hear ya and I'm watchin'
But I'm serious haters so all I gotta say is what up

What it is bro (bro)
What it do mane (man)
Still the man from the pan to the blue flame
Still gettin' dough and make it rain with the loose change
I bet that what he did a show, now that's a damn shame
I guess that what he hatin' for boy u so damn lame (Sucker nigga)
Ya Click the same, a destined bunch of walkin' shit stain
Disgraced the A ya give the city such a bad name
You way back in my rear view mirror I'm in the fast lane
Still I hear ya loud and clear on ya lil' song
Go on getcha dissin' on while the king on
Your self esteem gone (why) cause I'm back now
Let's see if we can't teach these niggas how to act now
Ya Kissin' ass then, ya just as bad now
I check ya ass then, I shut ya ass down
And I deliver front and center, never back down
Who get the last laugh now sucker nigga

[Chorus]
I got a front street swag and a side street hustle
Center Hill, Cedar Ave. that's where I be sucker
South Grand Church Street, the first with that work
But we can get it to commercial, if ya need somethin' chirp with
Hey what I care bout who you askin', sayin' they ain't heard of me
I'm certified, certainly
Them videos ain't hurtin' me
I still ride with the window rolled down all around the A town like it's finn'a go down
If it was ever any questions, niggas finna' know now
Won't retire my thrown or surrender no crown
I never bow down (Never)
And never say die (Never)
Just to whom it may concern and who so ever may try
I'm forever Westside
And the featherweight dies
Tell them take your best shot
Goin' get yourself hot
Cause I yell Bankhead and you felt left out
I ain't mention yo name
That's what all this bout?

[Chorus]
From Summer Hill to the hills up in Hollywood
A house full, gettin' to it, you know how we do it (Yeah)
Yeah we smoke great (great)
And we drink good (good)
Then we ball hard, just like G's should
Buy what we want
Drive what we want
G4 up up and away we go, we fly where we want
Haters smile like they like it when they really don't
Wish they could just wish me away
That's what they really want
"I really hate his ass"
"I don't like him either"
"We'll do a song together, maybe then we can beat him"
"Somehow he must be stopped"
"Somethin' must be done"
"If we can't knock him off, let's just try him when he get caught with guns"
"Then if he really done (Yeah) and we really won (Yeah)
"Any more ideas? "
"Suggestions anyone? "
"How bout we stay up all night, on the blog sites
Spread vicious lies and nasty rumors we could all write"
But that's alright
Let the nerds hate
Cause in my face though, them words get ate
And hatin's hard work, when I just bounce back
This God's work
Tell all the haters I'm back!

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I am the only one that got through
The others died wherever they fell
It was an ambush
They came up from all sides
Give your leaders each a gun and then let them
Fight it out themselves

[Verse 2]
I've seen devils coming up from the ground
I've seen hell upon this earth
The next will be chemical
But they will never learn
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah
Ther will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
You see really I don't
Give a damn what you may think of me
(That's right you're a bad ass nigga)
I'mma do what I'mma do, I'mma say what I'mma say
(You think you're a bad ass nigga)
Ya understand what I'm saying?
Well you better

I was born in these streets
Raised in these streets
Walked in these streets
Taught by these streets
Lived in these streets
Hustled in these streets
Arrested in these streets
Protected by these streets

Yeah you know I walk
Through the valley of these streets
I shall not fear these streets
Because I run these streets
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
And I've paid my own dues
With my own pennies and now

1 - I'm a bad man
I'm not ashamed of
A bad man yeah
And don't need your love
I'm a bad man yeah
I'm not ashamed of
I'm a bad man
My life's made me tough

I've stood on these blocks
More hood on these blocks
Got paid on these blocks
Sprayed on these blocks
Moved in on these blocks
Went out on these blocks
I've been around the block
Been watched on these blocks

Yeah you know I walk
Through the valley of these blocks
I shall not fear these blocks
Because I run these blocks, yeah
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Paid my own dues with my own pennies
And I'm

Repeat 1

Now I believe the day will come
When my heart will decide to change
But until then
See everything will remain the same

Repeat 1

See sometimes I gotta tell myself
(I'm a bad man)
To keep surviving
And no matter what the cause
(I'm a bad man)
I gotta keep on keeping on yeah
Came up in these streets
(I'm a bad man)
There was no father there for me, hey ooh
(I'm a bad man)
Cause sometimes we would just have to go without eating
Hey how you like me now?
(I'm a bad man)
Give my life for my brother
See I'm a bad mother SHUT YOUR MOUTH
(I'm a bad man)
Go on, go on, go on, go on...

[Intro: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
This is what you do, this is what you do
This is what you do, this is what you do

[Chorus: Usher]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

[Verse 1: Usher]
Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to when me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it would be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
All I seem to think about is you

[Chorus: Usher]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

[Verse 2: Usher]
Now, what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should've been you
What's sad is I love her, but I'm falling for you
What should I do?
Should I, tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I, do exactly what I feel inside?
'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

[Chorus: Usher]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

[Verse 3: Usher]
At this point, the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her, but I gotta let her go
And she may not understand it while all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it, but the feeling's just too strong
You make, make, make me

[Bridge 1: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
Come along with
You're making me, you're making me
You make me wanna...

[Chorus: Usher]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

[Bridge 2: Usher]
Before anything began between us...
The one I used to run and talk to...
You used to say it would be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
All I seem to think about is you

[Chorus: Usher]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
I wonder why nobody don't like me
Or is it the fact that I'm ugly?
I wonder why nobody don't like me
Or is it the fact that I'm ugly?

I leave my whole house and home
My children don't want me no more
Bad talk inside de house dey bring
And when I talk they start to sing

Mama, look at boo boo they shout
Their mother tell them shut up your mouth
That is your daddy, oh, no
My daddy can't be ugly so

Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look at boo boo dey
Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look at boo-boo dey

I couldn't even digest me supper
Due to the children's behavior
John, come here a moment
(Yes, pa)
Bring de belt, you're much too impudent
John says it's James who started first
James tells the story in reverse
I drag my belt from off me waist
You should hear them screamin' round de place

Mama, look at boo boo they shout
Their mother tell them shut up your mouth
That is your daddy, oh, no
My daddy can't be ugly so

Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look at boo boo dey
Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look at boo-boo dey

So I began to question the mother
These children ain't got no behavior
So I began to question the mother
These children ain't got no behavior

They're playing with you my wife declared
You should be proud of them, my dear
These children were taught too bloomin' slack
That ain't no kind of joke to crack

Mama, look at boo boo they shout
Their mother tell them shut up your mouth
That is your daddy, oh, no
My daddy can't be ugly so
Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look at boo boo dey
Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look at boo-boo dey
Shut your mout', go away
If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be travelling on now
There's just too many places I've got to see

But if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

And this bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I can't change

Bye bye, baby, it's been a sweet love yeah, yeah
And though this feeling I can't change
But please don't take this so badly
'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame

But if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And this bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I can't change
Lord, help me, I can't change

Lord, I can't change
Won't you fly high free bird?
Yeah

Oh, how I miss you tonight, miss you while lights are low
Oh, how I need you tonight, more than you'll ever know
Each moment, though we're apart, you're never out of my heart
But I'd rather be lonely, and wait for you only
My dear, how I miss you tonight
(musical interlude)
Each moment, though we're apart, you're never out of my heart
But I'd rather be lonely, and wait for you only
My dear, how I miss you tonight
A roving, a roving since roving's been my ruin
I'll go no more a roving from you, fair maid

In Amsterdam there lives a maid
Mark, well, what I do say
In Amsterdam there lives a maid
And she was mistress of her trade

I'll go no more a roving from you, fair maid
A roving a roving since roving's been my ruin
I'll go no more a roving from you, fair maid
I'll go no more a roving from you, fair maid

Her eyes are like two stars so bright
Mark, well, what I do say
Her eyes are like two stars so bright
Her face is soft, her step is light

I'll go no more a roving from you, fair maid
I'll go no more a roving from you, fair maid
Her cheeks are like the rosebud's red
Mark, well, what I do say
Her cheeks are like the rosebud's red
There's a wealth of hair upon her head

I'll go no more a roving from you, fair maid
A roving, roving, roving, roving, roving's been my ruin
I'll go no more a roving from you, fair maid

A roving, a roving since roving's been my ruin
I'll go no more a roving from you, fair maid
I used to sit by my fireplace
And dream about you
But now that won't do
There's a flaw in my flue

Your lovely face in my firplace
Was all that I saw
But now it won't draw
My flue has a flaw

From every beautiful ember a memory arose
Now I try to remember and smoke gets in my nose

It's not as sweet by the unit-heat
To dream about you
So darling, adieu
There's a flaw in my flue

And left me standing, how long, how long
Ain't had no loving since my babe been gone
Now listen to me mama, why did you make me go around here
Ain't had no loving, how long, how long?
Oh-oh why
Why should I feel
So discouraged

Should the shadows come
Hmm-hmm-hmm

Oh tell me why, why, why
Why should I feel so, so lonely, so lonely
And long, long for heaven and a home
Oh yeah

Since Jesus, since Jesus
Since Jesus is my potion
I wanta tell the world my constant
My constant friend
Oh is he
Please stay with me Jesus

I know, oh I know his eyes
His eyes are on the sparrow, yes it is
And I know Jesus watches
He watches over me
Oh thank you Jesus
I sing
People I can sing my song
'Cause, 'cause I'm happy, help me Jesus
Oh I sing, Lord I sing because I'm free
Oh, oh Jesus, Jesus, Jesus his eyes
His eyes on, on, yes it is, on the sparrow
And I know, Jesus, Jesus
Jesus watches me
Why even in France the best upper sets do it
Lithuanians and Letts do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
In old Japan, all the Japs do it
Up in Lapland little Laps do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the Fins
Folks in Siam do it, think of Siamese twins
In shallow shoals English souls do it
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
The chimpanzees in the zoos do it
Some courageous kangaroos do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
I'm sure giraffes on the sly do it
Even eagles as they fly do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
Electric eels I might add do it
Though it shocks 'em I know
Why ask if shad do it, garcon de "shad roe"
The world admits bears in pits do it
Even Pekingeses at the Ritz do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
The royal set sans regret did it
And they considered it fun
Marie Antoinette did it with or without Napoleon
Parliament pleasure bent did it
Mademoiselles every time their short of rent did it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
Roll up, roll up for the magical mystery tour
Step right this way

Roll up, roll up for the magical mystery tour
Roll up, roll up for the mystery tour
The magical mystery tour is waiting to take you away
Waiting to take you away, take you today

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away

Wo, wo, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see?
Can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
Whoa

I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away
She's got a ticker to ride
She's got a ticker to ride
She's got a ticker to ride
And she don't care

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Do

[Chorus]
Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy
Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy

[Verse 1]
It's like spendin' time with you
Just doin' absolutely nothing
That makes me happy
When you're at work, puttin' on your t-shirt
And I love it, absolutely love it

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the smile of a child
It's your eyes, it's your hair
It's the touch of your skin
That's what gets me there
It's also enticing
Waking up from a nice dream
To a beautiful morning with you by my side
That's nice

[Chorus]
Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy
Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy

[Verse 2]
It's like walkin' through the sprinklers
Smellin' every flower one by one
Mmm, yeah, makes me happy, yeah
It's like telling me you love me
Showin' me you love me, baby, my pretty baby

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the smile of a child
It's your eyes, it's your hair
It's the touch of your skin
That's what gets me there
It's also enticing
Waking up from a nice dream
To a beautiful morning with you by my side
That's nice

[Chorus]
Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy
Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy

[Verse 3]
It's like Saturday, ohh
Four day weekend, ohh
Hiding and seeking with you
Like we do, it's beautiful
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy
Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy
Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy
Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy
Life is dull
It's nothing but one big lull
Then presto you do a skull
And find that you're reeling
She sighs and you're feeling
Like a toy on a string
And your heart goes: "Ring-a-ding ding, ring-a-ding ding, ring-a-ding ding"

How could that funny face
That seemed to be common place
Project you right in to space
Without any warning
Don't know if its morning, night-time, winter or spring
What's the difference
Ring-a-ding ding, ring-a-ding ding, ring-a-ding ding

She takes (grabs) your hand - this captivating creature
And like its planned - you're in the phone book
Looking (Hunting) for the nearest preacher

Life is swell
You're off to that small hotel
And somewhere a village bell
Will sound in the steeple
Announcing to people
Love's the loveliest thing
And the bell goes: "Ring-a-ding ding, ring-a-ding ding, ring-a-ding ding"

[Funkmaster Flex]
Yeah Dirty South baby - Ludacris
Shout to Shaka Zulu, my man Shawn Taylor

[DTP]
Yeah, Funk Flex, Volume Fo'
Disturbin The Peace, Def Jam South
'Cris (yeah) you ready?

[Ludacris]
Oh it's my turn? Aiight..
I got permission to put ya mamma in a headlock (what?)
She tried to jook me in a figure-fo' leg lock (ohh)
She said she like the way I stick and make the bed rock
Or how I lick and leave her twisted like a dreadlock, and it's on
So stop the sweatin like a wristband
And get some balance like a bike without the kickstand
I think I changed the definition of a hit man
Cuz I could really give a fuck about that bitch man, c'mon!
We puttin holes in your residence
And lose anybody for the right president
We thugged out street niggas with intelligence
So all that bullshit you yappin is irrelevant
Oh yeah, I represent the Dirty Southside
I'm a dentist makin women open they mouth wide
You be in jail still runnin it on the outside
Thank not then won't ya open up ya mouth riiiight, but who cares?

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I got my corner on lockdown
About to hold this whole block down
Ludacris tell em how the South sound
BOOOO-GRAAA  AH, UH UH UH GRAAA-AAH
UHH GRAAA AH uh oh uh oh uh oh

[Verse 2]
Comin to Shady Park is like a peep show
It's some respectable ladies and there some freak hoes
I know killers that go to church up in they street clothes
You'll end up missin more than Shaq when shootin free throws
They packin and bout to open up the dope spot
My neighborhood is stoppin cars like a roadblock
They movin' weight like Atlanta was movin boat rock
And catchin ums like seeun Muslims eatin pork chops - never happen
And meanwhile I been thinkin man
Niggas been slangin tapes like they slangin 'caine
Cuz in the hood its gettin ugly like orangutang
So if you tryin to stop the hustle get the dangalang
Okay, we tryin to make our own White House
Paint it black and start yellin our fuckin pipes out
You try to tackle some players and you'll get psyched out
They can't fuck with us niggas you think they dyked out, so don't play

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Disturbin The Peace, we do that monkey shit
Hey, what can I say? We got a monkey clique
See Dre'll throw on them shades, and make that funky shit
And keep y'all women away if they got funky clit
Understand, we got that dough and it get rolled up
You pay the price and still we got the block sold up
Ain't nothin nice a full house don't make you fold up
You full of heist and try to jet and I'm like -
Hold up, god damn - I need to say it on a megaphone
And tell your sister get the fuck up off the telephone
These fools is tickin me off like fifty metronome
I'm takin all of ya money just call me Pebbletone!
Alright? I got the pistol and the safe key
You betta tell your bitch to follow you to safety
How dare you wanna be heroes and tryna' chase me
It's Ludacris won't leave no evidence to trace me, you know why?

[Chorus]
Funky shit oh
Do that monkey shit oh
Do that monkey shit oh
Do that monkey shit oh
Do that monkey shit uh
Do that monkey shit uh
Do that monkey shit

[Intro]
Gone, gone, gone spinning slack through reality
Dance my way, falling up through the years
Until I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly
Losing breath underwater well I'm gone, gone, gone
Spin slack through reality
Dance my way, falling up through the years
Until I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly
Losing breath underwater when I'm gone, gone, gone
Spinning slack through reality
Gone, gone, gone spinning slack through reality
Dance my way, falling up through the years
Until I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly
Losing breath underwater well I'm gone, gone, gone
Spin slack through reality
Dance my way, falling up through the years
Until I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly
Losing breath underwater when I'm gone, gone, gone
Spinning slack through reality

Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking

[Chorus]
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past
And I'm gone

[Outro]
He swivels his head
He swivels his head
He swivels his head
He swivels his head
He swivels his head
All night and day, just chippin' away
It's all in a day's work
Tryin' hard to defend
The time that I spend alone

The crown that you lose, exploiting the blues
Won't get the job done
As hard as it bites
I'm keepin' my sights on you

What'cha gonna do for me?
What'cha gonna do for me?
What'cha gonna do for me?
When the chips are down, in the cool of the night

When nothing seems right
The feeling can take you
Strange as it seems
You make your own dreams come true

If you try to conceal
The way that you feel
You're asking for trouble
Just as sure as I cry, I'm keeping my eye on you
What'cha gonna do for me?
What'cha gonna do for me?
What'cha gonna do for me?
When the chips are down, in the cool of the night

What'cha gonna do for me?
What'cha gonna do for me?
What'cha gonna do for me?
When the chips are down, in the cool of the night

You don't have to tell me
I'm to blame for this
'Cause what you hold against me
Is what I miss
Will your high hopes get you there
Goal so far and yet so near
You can't ignore the writing on the wall
Every time you rise you fall
End nowhere in sight at all
Why should you pick it up and try again

Chorus:
Give it up, 'cause you can't win
Let it go while you still can
Gave it all you had, now you're feelin' bad
So you're gone, ready to roam
You come on so strong with that same sad song
Wherever you go
Run along, take your ball and go home
Promised yet another chance
Forbidden just a single glance
So much rides on what you say and do
Discarded truths and famous myths
Tales that life deceives you with
Certain things you always thought you knew
Chorus:
Helpful hands that pull you down
Smaller minds turn you around
Friends in need are never really true
Why should you put trust in this
Bridge above the dark abyss
You never learned you can't make all the rules

Chorus:
Dddd-doctor Ffff-funkenstein

We love you, Doctor Funkenstein
Your funk is the best
Take my body and give it a mind
To funk with the rest

We love you, Doctor Funkenstein
Your funk is the best
Take my body, give it a mind
To funk with the rest

No, yeah, yeah

Shut up!
Around and around
I say the joint was rockin'
A goin' 'round and round
Yeah reelin' and a rockin' what a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rockin' till the moon went down
Twelve o'clock
Well the place as packed
Front doors was locked
Well the place was packed
When the police knocked
Both doors flew back
But they kept on rocking
Rockin' Going 'Round and around
Yeah reelin' and a rockin' what a crazy sound
A well they never stopped rockin' till the moon went down
Oh it sounds so sweet I gotta take me a chance
Rose out of my seat I just had to dance
Started movin' my feet well a clappin' my hands
Well the joint started
Rockin' Going 'Round and around
Yeah reelin' and a rockin' what a crazy sound
A well they never stopped rockin' till the moon went down
Twelve o'clock
Well the place as packed
Oh twelve o'clock
Well the place was packed
When the police knocked
Ouh Both doors flew back
Mama they kept on rocking
Rockin' Going 'Round and around
Yeah reelin' and a rockin' what a crazy sound
They never stopped never stopped never stopped never stopped never stopped
Rockin' till the moon went down

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Word! thinking of a demo, late nights alone in my lemo
Not a Pictum my man, I'm talking black sadan
Stretched like a fine truck, E counts the grants
My plan; write a rhyme like nobody can
Totally unpredictable, understand? (WORD!!)
Talent is mine, but the judgement is yours
You vibe my records, my crew tours (YEAH!!)
You make request in my sale sore
You clear the shelves of the record store (UHH!!)
Soft core I'm not, but knowledge I got
I keep my posse in effect when I rock the spot
Grand hot, or maybe you forgot
You should've cracked the jams early before the cops block the lights
Mack magnifier, Hitman for hire
Drop when I fire, watch the guard wire
Ice ain't no lier, I'm never retire
Cause my back went ?? with young troops I inspire
Cold as nitrogen and fold as hydrogen
Thought you had a chance to wax, you better try again
Hip-Hop commando, Bum Rush Rambo (UHH!!)
Intelligence is my weapon, dum dump my ammo
It's okay plea it, call it as you see it
I'm from L.A. ~ this joint is like Viet-nam gangs illing
Wilding and killing, bars on your door please protect your children
I ain't no bad guy though suckers may try, they say I'm violent WHY?!!
Because I'm fly, got girls to date, therefore
Don't wanna hear no more, chauffeurs shut the damned door (WORD!!)
Cause I'm a player, I ain't no Beat-boy
I love the ladies and money is my real joy

[Ice-T as a Radio Request Line employee]
Don't worry about it homeboy, we've just rocked it but we'll rock it again
Cause that's our most requested record!
Oh come all you young fellers so young and so fine
Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul
Till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal

Where it's dark as a dungeon damp as the dew
Danger is double and pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that, that I've seen in my day
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine

And a pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home
And pity the miner digging my bones

Where it's dark as a dungeon damp as the dew
Danger is double pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine
’Twas in the town of Griffin
In the year of sixty-five
A well known famous drover ...

’Twas in the town of Griffin
In the year of sixty-five
A well known famous drover
Stepped up to me and talked
Sayin’ "How do you do, young cowboy
And how’d you like to go
Spend the summer pleasantly
In the hills of Mexico"

Well, me being out of work right then
To this drover I did say
"Well, this going out on the buffalo range
Depends on your pay
But if you pay good wages
Transportation to and fro
I think I might go with you
To the hills of Mexico"
Well, we crossed the ?? river, boys
Our troubles they begun
Lightening, flashlight, hell-fire
Had made the cattle run
I tread towards the hiding place
??
Comanches waiting to pick us off
On the hills of Mexico
Worry, worry, worry, worry is all I can do
Oh, worry, worry, worry, baby, worry is all I can do
Oh, my life is so miserable, baby
Baby, and it's all on account of you
You hurt me so bad, baby, when you said we were through
Oh, you hurt me, you know you hurt me so bad, baby
When you said we were through
Oh, but I would rather be dead, baby
Than to be here so alone and blue
Someday baby, oh, someday baby
Oh, someday baby, oh, oh, oh, oh, yes
Oh, someday baby
Ladies, I said ladies, "Ladies, if you got a man
And the man don't do like you think he should
Don't you hurt him? I said, don't you hurt him
Man happens to be God's gift to women"
So, ladies you must know that the man is already grown
So you can't raise him over again
So, the thing to do is throw your arms around him
Hold him close to you, look him straight in the eyes
And then you tell him, you tell him
You say, "Now baby, you been messing up
But I know you gonna do me better"
And when he look at you as if he wanna know when
Then you tell him,"Someday baby"
And if it seem like he's a little hard of hearing
Or not paying you much attention or something
Do like you ladies normally do, put your hands on your hip
And then you say it again, ow
He have to be a mighty hard hearted person
To not to listen to you
But I don't think it's fair to just talk to the ladies
I think I should say a few words to the men too
So, fellas, I said fellas
"Fellas, if you got a woman
And the lady don't do like you think she should
Don't you be goin' upside of her head now"
You know what I'm talkin' about
Don't you be beatin' on her
The judge says, much cheaper if you don't beat her
And you see if you hurt her, you only do one thing
I said, you hurt her, you only do one thing
You make her a little smarter
And she won't let you catch her the next time
So, the thing to do is throw your arms around the pretty little thing
Now, listen to me, listen to me
I don't care if she weigh thirty-two and a half pounds wet
Or five hundred and fifty pounds on her feet
If she's your lady and you dig her, then she's your pretty little thing
And then you tell her
You say, "Baby, baby, I don't care what they say about you
In the next block, your my old lady and I dig you
Let 'em talk, let 'em say what they want to say"
And fellas, you must know too that the ladies
God bless their sweet little souls
Ladies happen to be God's gift to man too, fellas
You all agreed? You better say it because your wife is listening
But is one more thing I must say to you fellas
Just one more thing, don't be too proud to beg
I said don't be too proud to beg, if you have to fall on your knees
To let your woman know that you love her, go on down there
I can see some of you cats got dirty minds in the place this evening
What I'm tryin' to say
Ladies love to hear their men say, "Baby I love you"
Don't you ladies?
I said ladies love to hear their men say, "Baby I love you"
Don't you ladies?
So fellas, tell your lady that you love her
She might think you're lying though
Tell your lady that you love her
Even if you are lying
But seriously speaking, when I goof
When I goof, I usually slide up to my woman
And I look straight at her, I have to get my look first
I usually say, I look like a little puppy
Begging for that last bone you been holding out on
I look straight at her and I say
"Baby, please forgive me, honey"
And then I wait a few minutes and see how she'll take it
And then I say "Baby, please forgive me, honey"
And then I stand back far enough
So that when she swing, I can duck
And then I say, "Baby, honey
You know when I goofed last week, I was high"
If she let me get away with that
Then I look at her real pitiful like this
Say, "Baby, honey, you know when you're high
Don't count"
And then I tell her, I say
"If you forgive me honey I'm gonna do better"
And when she look at me as if she wanna know when
Then I tell her, "Someday baby"
On my word of honor
All my love belongs to you
Please put your faith in me
You see how true I'll be
On my word of honor
You can trust me with your heart
And i pledge mine to you
It's yours my whole life through
Baby, lips never kiss you
Again if they're telling you a lie
And forever, ever, ever, ever and ever
I cross my heart and hope to die
On my word of honor
You mean everything to me
I swear by stars above
I'll keep my word, my love
Baby, lips never kiss you
Again if they're telling you a lie
And forever, ever, ever, ever and ever
I cross my heart and hope to die
On my word of honor
You mean everything to me
I swear by stars above
I'll keep my word, my love
Nobody knows where you are, how near or how far
Shine on you crazy diamond
Pile on many more layers and I'll be joining you there
Shine on you crazy diamond
And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph
Sail on the still breeze
Come on you boy child, you winner and loser
Come on you miner for truth and delusion and shine
Have you seen the mystic queen
Riding in her limousine
Over hills and over dales 'til morning

If you like I'll take you there
Find some colours you can wear
Colours that you've only seen while sleeping

Have you seen the mystic queen
Riding in her limousine
Over hills and over dales 'til morning

If you like I'll take you there
Find some colours you can wear
Colours that you've only seen while sleeping

[Verse 1]
Is love behind me?
Though I need you to satisfy me
Destiny will prove to divide me
For you're a part of me
I feel the love within you
Your beauty lies deep within you
Touching me when you feel the need to
Become as one with me

[Chorus]
So let me down easy
If ever you were to leave
My love, let me down easy
For all I know is you

[Verse 2]
Take you for granted?
That could never, never be
An advantage
All this love, and free from demanding
You have always felt the need to be pleased
And you stay close beside me
Though our minds are free for deciding
The life to lead and desiring
To see what they can see
Ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Let me down easy
If ever you were to leave
My love, let me down easy
Ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
Ah! Spending time, time with you
Counting the days of my life
Oh, hoping that, that with me
You will stay

[Chorus]
So let me down easy
If ever you were to leave
My love, let me down easy
For all I know is you

[Verse 3]
Being around you
Lovely things I feel are about you
Being strong until I'm without you
For you're the strength in me
And you give me inspiration
Realizing that it has taken
More love and more love makin'
To fulfill my every need

[Outro]
So for me
Let me down easy
If ever you were to leave
My love, let me down easy
If ever you were to leave
My love, let me down
Oh, easy
If ever you were to leave
My love, let me down, let me down, let me down
Easy, baby
Oh-ho! Let me down, hey, down, down, down, down
Easy
Hey, if ever, if ever, ever, ever you were to leave me

[Spoken Intro: Ewan McGregor]
This story is about love
The woman I loved is... dead

[Verse 1: David Bowie]
There was a boy
A very strange, enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far
Very far, over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

[Verse 2: David Bowie]
And then one day
One magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me:
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return"
Dear Sir or Madam, will you read my book?
It took me years to write, will you take a look?
Based on a novel by a man named Lear
And I need a job, so I want to be a paperback writer
Paperback writer

It's the dirty story of a dirty man
And his clinging wife doesn't understand
His son is working for the Daily Mail
It's a steady job but he wants to be a paperback writer
Paperback writer
Paperback writer

It's a thousand pages, give or take a few
I'll be writing more in a week or two
I can make it longer if you like the style
I can change it round and I want to be a paperback writer
Paperback writer

If you really like it you can have the rights
It could make a million for you overnight
If you must return it, you can send it here
But I need a break and I want to be a paperback writer
Paperback writer
Paperback writer
Paperback writer - paperback writer
Paperback writer - paperback writer

[Nikki Costa]
(Lala lalalala, lala lalalala, lala lalalala, lalala.)

As one human to another, I'd like to question you (what's the question?)
If it takes the sun and the rain to make a tree grow, (that's a hard one)
If it takes the moon and the tide to make the sea flow
What does it take to love a child? (to love a child)
To love a child (to love a child)

To love a child (to love a child), hmm, hmm, hmm (hmm, hmm, hmm)

[Said the bigger to the smaller raccoon, do you need someone to move you,]

[Said the smaller to the bigger raccoon, if you move I will follow.]
(Up they went to climb a tree, they end the day most happily.)
(Anything that they can do, humans can do too.)
As one human to another, I'd like to question you
If it takes the sun and the rain to make the tree grow, (to make the tree grow)
If it takes the moon and the tide to make the sea flow, (to make the sea flow)
What does it take to love a child? (to love a child)
To love a child (to love a child)
To love a child (to love a child), to love a child (hmm, hmm, hmm)
To love a child (lala, lalala, lala lalala, lala lalala, lala lalala, lala lalala)
(lala lalala, lala lalala, lala lalala, lala lalala, lala lalala, lala lalala,)
(lala lalala..)
Take a silver dollar and put it in your pocket
Never let it slip away
Always be a man, not a boy gone astray
When ya get half cra-zy from the August heat
Or on a frozen, rotted road
With no one to complain to about your achin' feet

[Chorus:]
You're gonna walk that endless highway
Walk that high-way till you die
All you children goin' my way
Better tell your home-life sweet goodbye

When I see a detour up ahead
Well, I leave it far behind
Who knows what you're apt to find there
With the cost of livin, and the price of dyin'
Well it look like t'me this time I won't be buyin'

[Chorus]
When they get a scapegoat by the throat
It's hard labour and cold beans
If ya get away real quick
You'll be eatin from the poison peanut machine
Well, I sing by night, wander by day
I'm on the road and it looks like I'm here to stay

[Chorus]
Just the other day, I heard my friend say
Life was oh so bad, love was all he had
You know all day long I sing sad songs
Got the blues feel, things no doctor can heal

You know that's okay, I never change my ways
Maybe I am wrong but I'll soon be gone

If I fail no one can ever tell
And if I'm wrong, I'll soon be gone

If I fail no one can ever tell
If I'm wrong, I'll soon be gone

I don't need no friends, I don't play no games
I need lots of room to roam before I go home
You know someday, Lord, if things go my way
I'll have a son of my own left here to carry on

If I fail no one can ever tell
And if I'm wrong, I'll soon be gone
Just the other day, I heard my friend say
Life would treat him so bad, love was all he had
You know all day long, I sing sad songs
Got the blues feel, things no doctor can heal

You know that's okay, I never, never change my ways
Maybe I am wrong but I'll soon be gone

[Intro]
Number thirteen:
Standing with your feet apart
And your hands on your waist
Then forward and back
Forward and back, forward and back
It's the wrong time and the wrong place
Though your face is charming, it's the wrong face
It's not her face, but such a charming face
That it's all right with me

It's the wrong song in the wrong style
Though your smile is lovely, it's the wrong smile
It's not her smile, but such a lovely smile
So it's all right with me

You can't know how happy I am that we've met
I'm strangely attracted to you
There's someone I'm trying so hard to forget
Don't you want to forget someone, too?

It's the wrong game with the wrong chips
Though your lips are tempting, they're the wrong lips
They're not her lips, but they're such tempting lips
That if some night you're free
Dear, it's all right
Yes, it's all right with me
This is a mean ole' world
Baby, to live in all by yourself
I said a mean, mean, mean ole' world
To live in all by yourself
When you can't get the woman you're loving
Because she's loving somebody else

I smile to keep from worrying
And I laugh just to keep from crying
Smile to keep from worrying

Laugh just to keep from crying
Trying to keep the public from knowing
Baby, what I've got on my mind

Someday, baby
When the blood runs cold in my veins
Someday, baby
When the blood runs cold in my veins
You won't be able to mistreat me no more then, baby
'Cause my heart won't feel no pain
We wish you the merriest, the merriest, the merriest, the merriest to you
We wish you the merriest, the merriest, the merriest, yes the merriest
We wish you the merriest, the merriest, the merriest Yule cheer
We wish you the happiest, the happiest, the happiest, yes the happiest
We wish you the happiest, the happiest, the happiest New Year
May your tree be filled with happiness, happiness and friendliness for all
May your heart be filled with cheerfulness
With happiness and cheerfulness and friendliness for all
We wish you the happiest, the happiest, the happiest, yes the happiest
We wish you the merriest, the merriest, the merriest Yule cheer
And the happiest New Year
The happiest and the friendliest, and the merriest, the cheerfullest
And the happiest New Year
I'll wake each morning and I'll promise to laugh
I'll say good morning to your old photograph
Then I'll speak to you, dear
Just as though you were here

When purple shadows start to welcome the dark
I'll take the same old stroll we took through the park
And I'll cling to you, dear
Just as though you were here

But I know so well that distance
And time will finally tear us apart
The farther you go, the longer you stay
The deeper the doubts in my heart

Each night before I wander off into sleep
I'll bring to light the tears I've buried so deep
Then I'll kiss you, my dear
Just as though you were here

And when I hear a lonesome train, I'm afraid
I'll think of all those trips we never quite made
Fragile dreams that we planned, then I'll reach for your hand
Just as though, just as though you were here

[Verse 1]
Back down memory lane
I began as my mother's bright idea
A short time later
They all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father
So I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark
But it was only because I was a believer

[Pre-Chorus]
I was told when I was two years old
She swore that I would be special
I took a good look around and thought, "Don't worry, Mama
This city's gonna help you"

[Chorus]
(Thank you) Georgia (Georgia)
You'll always be home to me
Georgia (Georgia)
I belong to you, and yes, you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from, uh
I'm proud to say that I'm your son

[Verse 2]
I'm movin' on
Using mostly dirt roads until I find my way
Campbellton Road
Can't forget Cascade or remember old MLK
There's somethin' about Atlanta
That doesn't cease to amaze me
Oh, after all
You even raised the people that raised me

[Pre-Chorus]
And my old man is buried there
Can't be mad now, why bother?
And you have been my Mother Nature
Also my godfather

[Chorus]
(Thank you) Georgia (Georgia)
You'll always be home to me
Georgia (Georgia)
I belong to you, and yes, you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from, uh
I'm proud to say that I'm your son

[Bridge]
I surrender my soul, flesh and bone
Inspired by the greatest love I know

[Chorus]
Georgia (Georgia)
You'll always be home to me
Georgia (Georgia)
I belong to you, and yes, you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from, uh
I'm proud to say that I'm your son

[Outro]
Georgia
Georgia
One sound, one single sound
One kiss, one single kiss
A face outside the window pane
However did it come to this?
A man who ran, a child who cried
A girl who heard, a voice that lied
The sun that burned a fiery red
The vision of an empty bed
Use of force, he was so tough
She'll soon submit, she's had enough
The march of fate, the broken will
Someone is lying very still
He has laughed, he has cried
He has fought, he has died
He's just the same as all the rest
He's not the worst, he's not the best
And still this ceaseless murmuring
The babbling that I brook
The seas of faces, eyes upraised
The empty screen, the vacant look
A man in black on a snow white horse
A pointless life has run its course
The red rimmed eyes, the tears still run
As he fades into the setting sun
{You're going on that plane to take you where you belong
But no, I have
You have got to listen to me
Do you have any idea what you have to look forward to if you stay here?
Nine chances out of 10 we both end up in a concentration camp and that
You're only saying these things to make me go

[Inaudible]
Inside us, we both know we belong in different

[Inaudible]}

[Verse]
No one will ever know my heart is breaking
Although a million teardrops start to flow
I'll cry myself to sleep and wake up smiling
I'll love you but no one will ever know

[Chorus]
I'll tell them we grew tired of each other
And that I was glad the day you set me free
I'll even make believe I never loved you
And no one will ever know the truth but me

[Chorus]
I'll tell them we grew tired of each other
And that I was glad the day you set me free
I'll even make believe I never loved you
And no one will ever know the truth but me
You know a love so fine, so high above
Goes on forever but the road is rough
Reaching for another as truth will show
Try to live without it but you can't let go

We don't talk about it, we got no doubt
We can love each other when the lights go out
I got nobody, my bird has flown
Anyone can see I'm walking alone, walking alone

In your quiet moments, in your silent prayer
I'll be with you baby, I'll be there
In your darkest hour, on your longest night
I'll be with you baby, make it right
On your longest night

You know it breaks my heart and it hurts my pride
To know I lost you to the world outside
Feelings when you touch me, they rise and fall
Try to live without it, ain't no love at all
We don't talk about it but somebody knows
We can love each other when the candle glows
Open my eyes and the moment is gone
Anyone can see I'm walking alone, walking alone

In your darkest hour, on your longest night
I'll be with you baby, make it right

Nobody cries, nobody cries, cries
For the pain I feel
Nobody knows, nobody knows
And it makes me wanna die

In your quiet moments, in your silent prayer
I'll be with you baby, I'll be there
In your darkest hour, on your longest night
I'll be with you baby, make it right
On your longest night

Oh baby, so in love with you
It could be your longest night
Gonna be here all night, standing all night
Be your longest night

Gonna be here all night, standing all night, tonight
Gonna be here all night, standing all night
Gonna be here all night, standing all night
Gonna be here all night, standing all night
Be your longest, longest, longest night
Gonna be here all night, standing all night
Gonna be here all night, standing all night
Gonna be here all night, standing all night
When no one cares, and the phone never rings
The nights are endless things, you're like a child that cries
And no one hears the crying, you're like a falling star that dies
And seems to go on dying, when no one cares
You just count so many years and they glisten
With each tear, you can't believe that a love like hers
Could come from someone new, when no one cares but you
We've been writing letters each day
Hoping that you'll come home
And we're wondering if you're okay
As you're not on the phone

Face the facts now
Take a chance
Come on back now
Fast

Please come home
Please come home
Everyone cares for you
Please come home
Please come home
Everyone cares for you
Everyone

We've been writing letters each day
Hoping
That you'll...
Come home
Before I begin, I would like to note that I am not a "Barb" – that’s not to be taken as a negative statement, but rather to let you, the reader, know that my opinions aren’t biased

With that out of the way, I am someone who extremely respects the accelerated rise of a superstar - and not just someone who tops the Billboard Hot 100 with one or two songs to later fade into non-relevance

Don’t get me wrong, I'm all about artists having their "moment" - but creating that moment, while still a pretty monumental task, is the easy part. What's hard is sustaining that rapid ascendance to the top

To become a mainstay in the music industry, it takes multiple hit songs, impressive live performances, educated sit-down interviews, and an extremely hard work ethic to create a superstar. It also requires you to earn the respect of your fellow peers – because, let’s face it, how can someone be labeled a “superstar” without having earned the respect from fans, the media, and even other artists?

And while it’s not often that a new superstar emerges, if I had one word to describe Nicki Minaj and her meteoric rise to fame, it would be just that – superstar

We all know the backstory – Nicki was born in Trinidad, moved to New York City as a child with her family, had a rough childhood as her father, attended LaGuardia High School (not because of her rapping, but acting), and was eventually signed to Lil Wayne’s Young Money label

During the lengthy bidding war for Nicki Minaj, which involved various record labels, Lil Wayne had hopes that she would eventually sign with him and become the “First Lady of Young Money”. After some persuasion, as well as a $5 million dollar signing-bonus, his dream became a reality

That following year, as we all know with the release of her debut album, “Pink Friday”, a superstar began to emerge…

What’s so ironic about the accelerated rise to fame for Nicki Minaj is that the adversity she had to deal with as a child isn’t even the biggest obstacle that she had to overcome to be a star

The real hurdle in her way, and one that has caused problems for many female rappers of this past decade, was making a name for herself in the male-driven and male-dominated world that is rap

With a large amount of guest appearances to her name – including being featured on songs by hip hop heavyweights Kanye West, Jay-Z, and Beyoncé and on songs by pop icons Mariah Carey, Madonna, and Britney Spears – Nicki made a name for herself by outshining her more-established peers on their own songs
As the most successful commercial female rapper of all-time, Nicki also proved that she could compete for airplay on Top 40 radio with smash hits like “Superbass”, “Starships”, and “Moment For Life”. No longer was she confined to creating singles for urban radio, but she was now a bonafide-hit across all genres

Now, with a staggering net worth of over $50 million, Nicki has proven that she can hang with any male rapper in the game bar-to-bar, create radio-friendly and chart-topping hits that rival those of pop’s biggest acts, and attract the attention of huge brand names like Coke, Pepsi, MAC, and Adidas for multi-million dollar endorsement deals

If that’s not the power of a superstar, then I don’t know what is
What you gon do with all that meat
All that meat down to your feet
I'ma f**k you and skeet skeet skeet
Skeet skeet skeet, skeet skeet skeet

It's all it takes to live a dream
We're walking hand in hand, you've got to understand
And one day soon, we'll live in harmony

Just a little more love, just a little more peace
It's all it takes to live a dream

And one day soon, we'll live in harmony

Just a little more love, just a little more peace

And one day soon, we'll live in harmony

Just a little more love, just a little more peace

We're walking hand in hand, you've got to understand
And one day soon, we'll live in harmony

Just a little more love, just a little more peace
It's all it takes to live a dream
We're walking hand in hand, you've got to understand
And one day soon, we'll live in harmony
Just a little more love, just a little more peace
It's all it takes to live a dream
We're walking hand in hand, you've got to understand
And one day soon, we'll live in harmony

Just a little more love, just a little more peace
It's all it takes to live a dream
We're walking hand in hand, you've got to understand
And one day soon, we'll live in harmony

Just a little more love
Just a little more love
Just a little more love

Ah....
Lord bless all. lord let all be blessed
And when you sleep. london streets are silent
All the world is full of song
And when you have woken , after dawn has broken
Snow filled fens will vaguely fill your eyes 
You'll be guided by good will
Now the bells in your town are ringing 
Far away the joy of carols singing 
Bringing all a song to share
Lord bless all. lord let all be blessed
And when you sleep . london streets are silent

(break)

Ah....
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
With an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home and i miss my loved one so
In the early morning rain with no place to go

Out on runway number nine big 707 set to go
But i'm stuck here on the grass where the cold winds they do blow
And where whiskey was and bars and the women they were fine
There she goes my friend, she rolling down at last

Here the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly
There the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time

This old airport's got me down it ain't no earthy good to me
Because i'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as i can be
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a railroad train
So i'd best be on my way in the early morning rain

[Verse 1]
So far this love is delightful
The face of seduction was you
But I listened for each and every footstep
In this Real Cool World

[Verse 2]
Questioning saintlike and fantastic heroes
Feeling like lost little children in fabled lands
So I listen for each and every friendship
In this Real Cool World

[Refrain]
Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

[Verse 3]
Starry-eyed life but somehow believing in nothing
You whisper sweet nothing but reading between your lines
I listen color me doubtful
In this Real Cool World

[Refrain]
Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

[Bridge]
You came from nowhere
You came from nowhere
You held me you shook me
Hey

[Interlude]
It's a Cool World
It's a Cool World
It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World

[Refrain]
Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

[Refrain]
Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

[Outro]
Mmmm
Real Cool World

Ah, yes, well I myself, Larry Olivier, am a method actor, and I studied at the prestegious school of Julliard, and you know, I feel as if, you know, the rappers, and the musicians, and what not, get into acting, you know, you know, it's disrespecting the craft. I feel as if, you know, they're taking jobs from us, from us trained actors and I feel as if they should just leave it to the pros

[Big Boi]

[Big Boi]
Hell yeah. Aye, you gonna buy me some popcorn?

[Chorus]
Sunshine go away today
I don't feel much like dancing
Some man's gone, he's tried to run my life
He don't know what he's asking

[Verse 1]
He tells me I'd better get in line
Can't hear what he's saying
When I grow up I'm going to make it mine
But these ain't dues I been paying

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna ask y'all
How much does it cost?
I'll buy it
The time is all we've lost
I'll try it
He can't run his life
No, he can't run his own life
He can't even run his life
He can't run his life
I'll be damned if he'll run mine
Ah, sunshine

[Chorus]
Sunshine go away today
I don't feel much like dancing
Some man's gone, tryin' to run my life
He don't know what he's asking

[Verse 2]
Working starts to make me wonder where
The fruits of what I do are going
He says in love and war all is fair
But he's got cards he ain't showing

[Outro]
I wanna ask y'all
How much does it cost?
I'll buy it
The time is all we've lost
I'll try it
He can't run his life
No, he can't run his own life
He can't run his life
Ah, he can't
He can't run his life
The man can't run his life
He can't run his life
Ah, he can't
He can't run his life
Ah, he can't
He can't run his life
Ah, he can't
He can't run his life
Ah, he can't
He can't run his life
No, he can't
He can't run his life
No, he can't
He can't run his life
Ah, he can't
He can't run his life
How can you tell me
He can't run his life
When a man can't run his own
He can't run his life
I don't need
He can't run his life
I'll be damned
He can't run his life
If he'll run mine
Ah, sunshine
Go away
Go away
Ah, sunshine, go away
I have never been so much in love, in love before
What a difference how true love made in my life
So nice and so right
Lovers come and then lovers go
That's what the people say
Don't they know that how it feels when you love me
And hold me and say you care
And what we have is much more than they can see
And what we have is much more than they can see
Baby, what we have is much more than they see
Oh baby, whoa yeah
I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in love
I'm in love with you, girl
I say love, I never knew that a touch
Could mean, could mean so much
What a difference and when we walk hand in hand
I feel, I feel so real
Lovers come and then lovers go, that's what the people say
Don't they know that how it feels when you love me
And hold me and say you care
And what we have is much more than they can see
Yes, what we have is much more than they can see
And what we have is much more than they can see
Oh, yeah
Train roll on
On down the line, won't you
Please take me far away

Now I feel the wind blow
Outside my door means I'm
I'm leaving my woman at home, Lordy

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Oh my baby's gone with the wind

And I don't know
Oh where I'm going
I just want to be left alone

Well when this train ends
I'll try again oh but
I'm leaving my woman at home, Lordy

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind
Train roll on
Tuesday's gone
Train roll on
Many miles from my home, see I'm
I'm riding my blues away, yeah

Well Tuesday you see
Oh she had to be free, Lord but
Somehow I got to carry on, Lordy

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind, oh
My baby's gone with the wind
Train roll on
Roll on
'Cause my baby's gone
I'm riding my blues babe
Trying to ride my blues
Ride on train
Ride on train
Ride my blues babe
Come back to me babe
Come back to me oh train
Roll on train
Wooaahh...
Ride on train
Tuesday
One, two, three, four
Here comes Santa in his sleigh
Those silver bells they sound so gay
His shiny sleigh is heaped with toys
To give to all good girls and boys
With dolls and gollywogs and clockwork trains
Trams, tin soldiers and little model planes
Going to fill your stocking so long as you've been good
And I'm sure that you have because you know you should
Middle eight!
"Have I got to sing that?"
"Yes!"
"No you don't sing, you just say it"
"Okay"
"All right?"
"Right"
"One, two, three . . ."
Cheerful face is wreathed in smiles
Can see him coming for miles and miles
As he passes by he'll catch your ear
With "Merry Christmas, guys, and a happy New Year!"
"Man!"
"Shout that as a cheery Christmas greeting, Alan"
"Yeah, shout that one out, right?"
Turkey and sausages and Christmas pud
"Have another helping John!"
Oh, I don't think I could
Christmas parcels under the tree
None for you and six for me!
Trip to heave and ho, up down, to and fro'
You have no word
Trip, trip to a dream dragon
Hide your wings in a ghost tower
Sails cackling at every plate we break
Cracked by scattered needles
The little minute gong
Coughs and clears his throat
Madam you see before you stand
Hey ho, never be still
The old original favorite grand
Grasshoppers green Herbarian band
And the tune they play is "In Us Confide"
So trip to heave and ho, up down, to and fro'
You have no word
Please leave us here
Close our eyes to the octopus ride!
Isn't it good to be lost in the wood
Isn't it bad so quiet there, in the wood
Meant even less to me than I thought
With a honey plough of yellow prickly seeds
Clover honey pots and mystic shining feed...
Well, the madcap laughed at the man on the border
Hey ho, huff the Talbot
The winds they blew and the leaves did wag
They'll never put me in their bag
The raging seas will reach and always seep
So high you go, so low you creep
The wind it blows in tropical heat
The drones they throng on mossy seats
The squeaking door will always squeak
Two up, two down we'll never meet
Please leave us here
Close our eyes to the octopus ride!

I feel how I feel, I'm real like I'm real
Tension in my shoulder cause a nigga feelin older
Cold cuts for dinner, not a winner now its obvious
I'm probably just better off, quit spittin'
I feel how I feel, I'm real like I'm real
Tension in my shoulder cause a nigga feelin older
Cold cuts for dinner, not a winner now its obvious
I'm probably just better off, quit spittin'

Something magical had to happen, we got to rapping
The dj started scratching, behind his back we started clapping
Man in the middle, stand and deliver, this is one to remember
From city to city, we getting busy digging the scene, check it
A brand new record, only gets better from here
Something new to bump for the new year
Got good where I once stood, now I see clear
And it feels good to live life with ought no fear, yeah
We can take it there if you pay your fare, oh yeah
If you make it there you can taste the air
Just another piece of my collection
Look we're all connected, from all directions
I play my part and spread the message
I feel how I feel, I'm real like I'm real
Tension in my shoulder cause a nigga feelin older
Cold cuts for dinner, not a winner now its obvious
I'm probably just better off, quit spittin'
I feel how I feel, I'm real like I'm real
Tension in my shoulder cause a nigga feelin older
Cold cuts for dinner, not a winner now its obvious
I'm probably just better off, quit spittin'

Political, incorrect, with no intellect
Folks don't know the hole scenario
Brain washed, got diluted, you and I included
Why the true living god got executed
Privacies intruded, overseas invasion to get that new shit
Mad abrasion, on that rude shit while folks still pledge allegian' with that bullshit
Rally up the folks, tally up the vote
Hieroglyphics on a hundred dolla' c- note
To get specific we in the boat with no paddle, up shit creek, many get sent to battle

I feel how I feel, I'm real like I'm real
Tension in my shoulder cause a nigga feelin older
Cold cuts for dinner, not a winner now its obvious
I'm probably just better off, quit spittin'
I feel how I feel, I'm real like I'm real
Tension in my shoulder cause a nigga feelin older
Cold cuts for dinner, not a winner now its obvious
I'm probably just better off, quit spittin'
Yeah, hell yeah, know what I'm sayin, yeah

(Verse Three: Dre and Snoop)
Now understand this my nigga Dre can't be touched

Musta, thought I was sleazy
Or though I was a mark cause I used to hang with Eazy
Animosity, made ya speak but ya spoke

Gap teeth in ya mouth so my dick's gots to fit

To show you how Death Row pull off that whoride
Now you might not understand me
Cause I'ma rob you in Compton and blast you in Miami
Then we gon creep to South Central
On a Street Knowledge mission, as I steps in the temple
Spot him, got him, as I pulls out my strap
Got my chrome to the side of his White Sox hat

[Verse 1]
Who said the sea can't move in winter
Or the clouds stand still in a storm?
Who said a man can't cry and be lonely?
Who says a man can't tend to be bored?
And if you could see inside my heart
You would see loneliness
And if I could show you my mind
You would be depressed

[Chorus]
So I I sit away lonely
And I get away only in my mind
Said, I sit away lonely
And I get away sometimes

[Verse 2]
So I gather my things and be on my way
Into my lonely place
Said, I'm feelin' lonely and lonesome
And I just need to get away
And if you could know what I'm afraid of
You would be frightened
If you could feel the pain that I'm feelin'
Then you would know why

[Chorus]
So I sit away lonely
And I get away only in my mind
Said, I sit away lonely
And I get away sometimes

[Breakdown]
So I sit away
Said, I get away
Said, I sit away
Said, I get away

[Bridge]
Oh, why do I feel like I will never be loved again?
There I go back in my mood again
Lonely, lonely, sit away
Help me, just get away
Can you hear me?

[Chorus]
Said I sit away lonely
And I get away only in my mind
Said, I sit away lonely
And I get away sometimes
Said, I sit away lonely
And I get away only in my mind
Said, I sit away lonely
Sometimes, I just go, and I get away
Said, I sit away lonely
And I get away only in my mind
Said, I sit away lonely
And I get away sometimes
Said, I sit away lonely
And I get away only in my mind
Said, I sit away lonely
And I get away sometimes
Said, I sit away lonely

[Intro]
Love, let me know, let me know
Love, let me know, let me know, let me know

[Verse 1]
When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard for me to tell you so
You may not be in the mood
To learn what you think you know
There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see

[Chorus]
But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Love, let me know, let me know

[Verse 2]
When you feel what you feel
Oh, how hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place
Before this love affair began
But if you feel, oh, like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say I'm all about, all about

[Chorus]
But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
No, no, no, no

[Bridge]
Tell me what it is (Tell me what it is)
There's no need to make believe
(Make believe, no need to make believe)
Look beyond your world (look beyond your world)
Try to find a place for me
(Try and find, find a place for me)

[Chorus]
'Cause at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
And if you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know

[Outro]
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, oh
Love
Oh, baby
Stay at your best, baby, yeah
Please do it for my sake, sweet lady

[Intro]
O Holy Night

[Verse 1]
Oh Holy Night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appears and the soul felt its worth

[Pre-Chorus]
The thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees, oh
And hear the angels' voices

[Chorus]
Oh, night divine
Oh, night
When Christ was born
Oh, night divine
Oh night
Oh, Holy night

[Bridge]
Is it in the air
A feeling of love everywhere
What a joyous thing
When Jesus was born, yeah

[Verse 2]
Truly He taught us
To love one another
His law is love and
And His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break
For the slave is our brother
And in His name
All oppression shall cease

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet hymns of joy in
Grateful chorus raise we
All within us
Praise His holy name
He knows our need, oh yeah
To our weakness, ah yeah, he's no stranger, no no
Behold your King, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Behold the lonely dream

[Chorus]
Oh, night divine
Oh, night
Oh, night divine

[Outro]
Behold our King
Behold our King

O holy night
O holy night
Everything is gonna be wonderful, joyous, righteous

[Intro]
Oooo Merry Christmas Saint Nick
Christmas comes this time each year
Oooo

[Verse 1]
Well, way up north where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year working out on his sled

[Chorus]
It's the little Saint Nick (Ooo little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (Ooo little Saint Nick)

[Verse 2]
Just a little bobsled we call it old Saint Nick (Ooo)
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick (Ooo)
She's candy-apple red with a ski for a wheel (Ooo)
And when Santa hits the gas, man, just watch her peel (Ooo)

[Chorus]
It's the little Saint Nick (Ooo little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (Ooo little Saint Nick)

[Bridge]
Run, run, reindeer
Run, run, reindeer (Woah, woah-oh)
Run, run, reindeer
Run, run, reindeer
He don't miss no one

[Verse 3]
And hauling through the snow at a frightening speed (Ooo)
With a half a dozen deer with Rudy to lead (Ooo)
He's gotta wear his goggles because the snow really flies (Ooo)
And he's cruising every pad with a little surprise (Ooo)

[Chorus]
It's the little Saint Nick (Ooo little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (Ooo little Saint Nick)

[Outro / Fadeout]
Ohh, Merry Christmas Saint Nick (Ooo)
Christmas comes this time each year
Ohh, Merry Christmas Saint Nick (Ooo)
Christmas comes this time each year
Ohh, Merry Christmas Saint Nick (Ooo)
Christmas comes this time each year
I am dreaming Dear of you, day by day
Dreaming when the skies are blue, When they're gray;
When the silv'ry moonlight gleams, Still I wander on in dreams
In a land of love, it seems, Just with you

Let me call you "Sweetheart," I'm in love with you
Let me hear you whisper that you love me too
Keep the love-light glowing in your eyes so true
Let me call you "Sweetheart," I'm in love with you

Longing for you all the while, More and more;
Longing for the sunny smile, I adore;
Birds are singing far and near, Roses blooming ev'rywhere
You, alone, my heart can cheer; You, just you

Let me call you "Sweetheart," I'm in love with you
Let me hear you whisper that you love me too
Keep the love-light glowing in your eyes so true
Let me call you "Sweetheart," I'm in love with you
Hey girl, is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand
So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you babe
Me and you until the end
But I guess I was wrong
Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without ya
Tell me is this fair?
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
Now girl, I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were moving on now
And maybe I should do the same
Funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, babe
And now, it's all just a shame
And I guess I was wrong
Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without ya
Can you tell me is this fair?
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
(Should've known better that you were gonna make me cry)
That you were going to make me cry
Now it's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around comes around
Yeah
What goes around comes around
You should know that
What goes around comes around
Yeah
What goes around comes around
You should know that
Don't want to think about it
(No)
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
(Yeah)
I just can't do without ya
Tell me is this fair?
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
(Should've known better that you were gonna make me cry)
That you were going to make me cry
Now it's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
But that's okay baby 'cause in time you will find
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
Listen Lady, let me lie low, lie low with you
To be lie-high-high-high-high-high, my! Oh my!
Slowly, we get too good and too holy
Helping one another, just a righteous brother
Night time, get me back in the night time
I don't want to be angel, just a little bit evil
I feel the devil in me

Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
Let go of me

Listen Lady, let me lie low, lie low with you
To be a lie-high-high-high-high-high, my! Oh my!

Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
Let go of me
I want a little girl, call my own
She must be someone who's all alone now
Say, I want a little girl to fall in love with me, oh yeah
I want a little girl, but she may not look
Just like a picture in a story book
If she can cook chicken, yeah, she'll suit me to a T

And she don't have to wave her hair
Or even wear fancy clothes, I wouldn't even care
She don't wear nylon hose, ohh

I want a little girl to love a lot
You know that I'd give her everything I got
I want a little girl to fall in love with me

[Ramsay]
If there’s one thing Theon might’ve taught ya

[Theon]
(one thing I’ve taught ya)

[Ramsay]
Is once I’ve got ya

[Theon]
(once he’s got ya)

[Ramsay]
You will be tortured

[Theon]
(it will be torture!

[Ramsay]
I’m a real bastard

[Theon, Myranda]
(he’s a bit of a bastard)

[Ramsay (and Chorus)]
A little more mean (a little more mean) than anyone you’ve ever seen (than anyone you’ve ever seen, ever seen)
Memories frozen in a picture frame
Days go on things will never be the same, anymore
Thoughts of you and the life we never lived
How can I pull through, when you left to soon

I belief, A part of you will always stay with me
I can feel that images of you will never fade away
I can’t move on, pretending everything’s gonna be the way we where
Why can’t you hear me, I am inconsolable

I wish I’d know you better, time was running out
The quilt I left is more than I can describe
And I keep on calling your name to feel that I’m alive
In this empty space, I could never be replaced

I belief, A part of you will always stay with me
I can feel that images of you will never fade away
I can’t move on, pretending everything’s gonna be the way we where
Why can’t you see me, when I am inconsolable

Everyday I try to carry on, everyday I try to find a meaning
Living in a place where I belong, as cold ice can be
If I could take you back to yesterday
But not for ever gone it’s in considerable
It almost that acceptable
Memories frozen in a picture frame
How can I pull through, when you left to soon

I can’t go on, pretending everything could be the way we where
How can you see me, when I’m inconsolable

A part of you will always stay with me
I can feel that images of you will never fade away
I can’t go on, pretending everything’s gonna be the way we where
Why can’t you see me, when I am inconsolable
South of the border, down Mexico way
That's where I fell in love when the stars above came out to play
And now as I wander, my thoughts ever stray
South of the border, down Mexico way

She was a picture in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while, I kissed the smile apon her face
'Cause it was fiesta and we were so gay
South of the border, Mexico way

Then she sighed as she whispered "mañana"
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied as a whispered "mañana"
'Cause our tomorrow never came

South of the border, I jumped back one day
There in a veil of white by the candlelight, she knelt to pray
The mission bells told me that I mustn't stay
South of the border, Mexico way

The mission bells told me, ding-dong, that I must not stay
Stay south of the border, down Mexico way
Aye, aye, aye, aye (aye, aye, aye, aye)
Aye, aye, aye, aye (aye, aye, aye, aye)
Aye, aye, aye, aye (aye, aye, aye, aye)
Aye, aye, aye, aye (aye, aye, aye, aye)
Hmmhmmmm hmhmmmm hmhmmmm

Some folks drink and some folks smoke
Some folks love and some folks don't
Some folks laugh and some folks frown
Some folks hear to gun you down
Goodbye John - six white horses come to take you home
Goodbye John -  took you away before you sang your song

Hmmhmmmm

Some preach black and some preach white
Which is wrong and which is right
Takes every kind to make the world go round
Only takes one to gun you down
Goodbye Martin - six white horses come to take you home
Goodbye Reverend - took you away before you sang your song

Hmmhmmmm hmhmmmmmmmmmmmmm

Some people stick pretty close to home
Some people are born with the urge to roam
Welcome welcome to our town
Hope nobody tries to gun you down
Goodbye Bobby - six white horses come to take you home
Goodbye Robert - took you away before you sang your song
Hmmhmmmm

Goodbye John goodbye Martin goodbye Bobby
Took you away before you sang your song

Hmmhmmmm hmhmmhmmhmmhmhmm
I'm in the wrong business
I swear I ain't lyin'
I stay hungry, broke all the time
I'm gonna send my guitar home
Leave these blues alone
I'm in the wrong business
I ain't lyin'

Should have been a boxer
Makin' the movie "Rocky 3"
I would be a star
Like the wrestler Mr. T
Should've been like Michael Jackson
When I was the age of five
But chose this guitar
Now I'm broke and can't survive

I'm in the wrong business
I ain't lyin'
'Cause I stay hungry, broke all the time
I'm gonna send my guitar home
Leave these blues alone
I'm in the wrong business
I ain't lyin'
These guitar freaks
Have made my blood sugar go up
Be better off
If I was driving a trailer truck
Like Boxcar Willie
I played these blues and made me a bum
I'm gonna give up this music
Move back to the farm

I'm in the wrong business
I ain't lyin'
'Cause I stay broke, hungry all the time
I'm gonna send my guitar home
Leave these blues alone
I'm in the wrong business
I ain't lyin'

I've played these blues
Now I'm full up to my neck
If I keep on playin' I tell you
I'm gonna do like Johnny Paycheck
He had a job
Got money for years
I'm gonna shelve my guitar
I ain't got no job to shelve
I'm in the wrong business
I ain't lyin'
Stay broke, hungry all the time
I'm gonna send my guitar home
Leave these blues alone
I'm in the wrong business
I ain't lyin'

I'm in the wrong business
I ain't lyin', folks
Stay broke, hungry all the time
I'm gonna send my guitar home
Leave these blues alone
I'm in the wrong business
I ain't lyin'

Miscellaneous
Everyday I Love You
Ev'ryday I love you just a little bit more, just a little bit more, just a little bit more'
Ev'ryday I want you just a little bit more than I did the day before
You'll never guess how deep my love is, not even in your wildest dream
But just so you'll get it clear; compared to my love, my dear
The Mississippi River's just a stream
Ev'ryday I love you just a little bit more, just a little bit more, just a little bit more, Ev'ryday I
Want you just a little bit more, than I did the day before
Weighin it with the balance
Smokin on the Cali
The way a nigga valet, you think i'm doin ballet
Live my life ruthless, feelin real coupe-ish
Yellow feet, yellow Vette, and that bitch roofless
Suede guts in the Benz same color Scooby
Bracelet like 'I'm him' Jacob sayin 'Who he?'
Ring sayin 'What's up' Chain sayin 'Oohwee'
Grill say 'Drugged up' Tats say 'So street'
Underwear Burberry, Favorite fragrance Wall Street
Type of girl? Real thick, favorite color money green
Candlelight dinner gave her Cristal & x-pill
Wake up in the morning give her crab legs and oatmeal
Lobster tail and cheese grits, you ain't never seen this
Money tall like skyscrapers and i really mean this
Lobster tail and cheese grits, you ain't' never seen this
Money tall like skyscrapers and i really mean this

Long paper, tall paper
Stick to skrill like flypaper
Car look just like now and later
Shoes right there are alligators
Goin to my old school from bumper to bumper fool
Chunk a hundred stacks now we got more than ?!?!? school
Just like my diamonds my car is so colorful
Rims pimped out, what the fuck I need Xzibit for?
I change lanes and i change hues from lime green to dark blue
Had it paint chameleon so they swang and they change too
Shine harder, grind harder, air ones look like tapwater, chrome rims look like silver quarters, got a see through top like bathwater
Dark green donks and the rims look like pickle juice
Twentysix inches sittin on the ??
Sittin in the hottub with the shawty off the Bentley Coupe
Paint look like bloodred and the guts look like tomato soup

Long paper, tall paper
Stick to skrill like flypaper
Car look just like now and later
Shoes right there are alligators

Big ol' chain, and a big ol' Range
My '74 Olds got a big ol brain
Yellow vette same color as the Dom champagne
2007 centerfielder Gucci Mane
Damn Gucci Mane your car so clean, got 5 girlfriends like a b-ball team
Got a gasoline catalina listerine, got a clearcoat Chevy call that bitch chlorine
Wall street cologne cost $3000 bucks, on my first date went and got my dick sucked
Goddamn Gucci Mane you too damn much, lockin down the brake and i'm holdin the clutch
There's just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Cause all I want for Christmas is...
You

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There's just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Cause all I want for Christmas is you
Ooh baby
I won't ask for much this Christmas
I don't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeers click
I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
Ooh baby

All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me...

[Chorus]
Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
Ooh baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
Oh by loving you
Loving you, my darling
Oh you've become
Much more than a lover to me
Yes, you are my companion
Oh you're my friend
And baby, you know
You're a part of me

Oh and that's why
Why I'm so lonely
Oh I'm so lonely
These passing days
Because I miss you, my darling
Not just one
But in so many, so many ways

Oh there's nothing left
Nothing left inside of me
Oh that loves you
Any less than before
Oh and if you
Wanna know the truth, baby
If you really, really
Wanna know the truth, baby
You know I want you
And need you even more
Oh what's done is done, baby
So I've been told
Oh but I can't stop loving you
Seems like I love you more
And I'll keep on loving you, baby
Until, until I'm dead and cold

Oh there's nothing left
Inside of me
Oh that loves you
Any less than before
M, and if you really
If you really, if you really
Wanna know the truth, baby
I love you, I love you
I love you even more

What is done, what is done
What is done is done
Oh but you know
I just can't stop loving you
I tell you the truth
I love you more, baby
And I'll keep on loving you
Until I'm dead
Until I'm dead and cold
Don't like good-byes, tears or sighs
I'm not too good at leaving time
I've got no taste for grieving time
No, no, not me

You've been my near ones, always my dear ones
I never thought that I would find
Another love, a different kind
But it came to be

Well if you think I'm telling you lies
Go try your luck and look into her eyes
But remember, you must remember she's mine
And my world overhead has a clear new shine

Don't want to leave you
Sorry to grieve you
It's traveling time, and I must move on
Found the girl (gal) to lean upon

And if I could arrange it
Oh would I care to chance it - not me

[Verse 1]
I thought my searching was done when I found you
So sure that you were the one it was all leading to
I can't believe that you're walking away
Now that no other will do

[Chorus]
You say, to give it time, that I will see
You're only doing what is best for me
But I say my chances now can only be
None to none
Of finding another only one

[Verse 2]
I would so love to believe, it's best you go
Right now, I could use anything to soften the blow
I can't deny what I know to be true
What you want from me, I just can't be for you

[Chorus]
You say, to give it time, that I will see
You're only doing what is best for me
But I say my chances now can only be
None to none
Of finding another only one

[Bridge]
Some people never get as far
As finding their only true love
And would they ever go so far as to say that I'm lucky
I don't feel so lucky tonight.... tonight... tonight...

[Chorus]
You say, to give it time, that I will see
You're only doing what is best for me
But I say my chances now can only be
None to none
Of finding another only one
Finding another only one
Ooo

It feels like
I
Can't survive
Like im not alive
But you can revive, me
We love

And i won't even try
To act like

Can't say goodbye
Cuz u can revive, me
We love

I want u to hold me
Console me
And i will give u, the whole me

Cuz u got me

Yea

Let it breathe
Let it breathe
Oooooo
I want you to hold me
*sigh*
Ooooo
Leeee-yeaaa-ooooo
Yea-ee
Wanna let it breathe
Move over, sun, and give me some sky
I got me some wings I'm eager to try
I may be unknown but wait till I've flown
You're gonna hear from me

Make me some room, you people up there
On top of the world, I'll meet you, I swear
I'm stakin' my claim, so remember my name
You're gonna hear from me

Fortune, smile on the road before me
I am fortune's child
Listen, world, you can't ignore me

I've got a song that longs to be played
Raise up my flag, begin my parade
Then watch the world over start comin' up clover
That's how it's gonna be

I've got a song that longs to be played
Raise up my flag, begin my parade
Then watch the world over start comin' up clover
That's how it's gonna be, watch me
You're gonna hear, you're gonna hear from me

Konvict Muzic... it's time to do it
I can't handle all these bills and payments
This stuff is overstressin me (but I still gotta do it)
Baby mama put me on them papers and get nothing for the baby (but I still gotta do it)
I can't keep on working, (keep on working)
Seems like the whole world's ignoring me (but I still gotta do it)
Schemers keep on dirking (keep on dirking)
Everybody's getting more than me (but I still gotta do it)

[Chorus]
So pass that drag, pass that dro, it's my life
So what you think, what you know?
Yes all right and I paid the price, but still I'm
Going thru a lot, sittin on the block now
Thru a lot, slangin out my drop now
Thru a lot, nobody's helping me whether they see it or not
Going thru a lot, I'm hittin on the cops now
Thru a lot, wishin they would stop now
Thru a lot, nobody's helping me whether they see it or not

[T-Pain]
All this music got me going crazy
Can't even concentrate on my family (but I still gotta do it)
Plus I gotta go thru all this family hatred
I don't know why everybody's hatin me (but I still gotta do it)
Even one of my homeboys thinking that I'm bangin his lady
I don't know why he would think that outta me (but he gotta go thru it)
To all the nappy headz I got you baby
We bout make it yes indeed (and we gon get thru it)

[Chorus]

[Bone Crusher]
I work a nine to five shawty and they think it's funny
And how they feel that my stress don't count homie
I hit the beat like a cop when I hit the block
Because my baby's gotta eat, I ain't gon never stop
I see them laughin at me fo cuz my pants red
And my do' won't shut and my car's shabby
But I see the future man like I'm nostradamus
And in my heart all I see is a future star
But in my brain ain't nothing but these notes man
But ya'll don't feel my stress ya'll don't understand
The next step is my pistol and it goes down
Wiggle it out fat boy just calm down
And sing this song, and sing that song
Cause god gon make a way for me to get my hustle on

[T-Pain]
Going thru a lot, sittin on the block now
Thru a lot, slangin out my drop now
Thru a lot, nobody's helping me whether they see it or not
Going thru a lot, I'm hittin on the cops now
Thru a lot, wishin they would stop now
Thru a lot, nobody's helping me whether they see it or not

Going thru a lot, thru a lot, thru a lot
Going thru a lot, thru a lot, thru a lot
Pedro lives out of the Wilshire Hotel
He looks out a window without glass
The walls are made of cardboard, newspapers on his feet
His father beats him 'cause he's too tired to beg

He's got 9 brothers and sisters
They're brought up on their knees
It's hard to run when a coat hanger beats you on the thighs
Pedro dreams of being older and killing the old man
But that's a slim chance he's going to the boulevard

He's going to end up, on the dirty boulevard
He's going out, to the dirty boulevard
He's going down, to the dirty boulevard

This room cost 2,000 dollars a month
You can believe it man it's true
Somewhere a landlord's laughing till he wets his pants
No one here dreams of being a doctor or a lawyer or anything
They dream of dealing on the dirty boulevard
Give me your hungry, your tired your poor I'll piss on 'em
That's what the Statue of Bigotry says
Your poor huddled masses, let's club 'em to death
And get it over with and just dump 'em on the boulevard

Get to end up, on the dirty boulevard
Going out, to the dirty boulevard
He's going down, on the dirty boulevard
Going out

Outside it's a bright night
There's an opera at Lincoln Center
Movie stars arrive by limousine
The klieg lights shoot up over the skyline of Manhattan
But the lights are out on the Mean Streets

A small kid stands by the Lincoln Tunnel
He's selling plastic roses for a buck
The traffic's backed up to 39th street
The TV whores are calling the cops out for a suck

And back at the Wilshire, Pedro sits there dreaming
He's found a book on magic in a garbage can
He looks at the pictures and stares at the cracked ceiling
"At the count of 3" he says, "I hope I can disappear"
And fly fly away, from this dirty boulevard
I want to fly, from dirty boulevard
I want to fly, from dirty boulevard
I want to fly-fly-fly-fly, from dirty boulevard

I want to fly away
I want to fly
Fly, fly away
I want to fly
Fly-fly away (Fly a-)
Fly-fly-fly (-way, ooohhh...)
Fly-fly away (I want to fly-fly away)
Fly away (I want to fly, wow-woh, no, fly away)

[Cee-Lo Green]
Another dust I discovered (Look what I've discovered)
A book without a cover (Ah, little black book)
I take to my favorite chair, by the fire..
The art of storytelling (I'm involved now)
Characters so compelling (I think I love her)
The words of a woman's willing mission:
To make my reality stranger than fiction

She's a novel, a mystery book
Looks like I found a future in her history book
So beautiful, that I'm blinded by the light..
(Blinded by the light..)
She's a sweet (sweet), sweet love story
Written especially for me
And I like to thank you for, all the adventure
And that excitement in my life
Al-riiiiiiiiight...

It's you I'm chasing after (sha-la-la-la-la-da-da)
From chapter to chapter (la-la-la-la-laaa-laaaaaah)
You led me to it (from inside me..)
Just got me through it (got me...)
I dream about you in my sleep
The hardest secret that I had to keep
Did she write me so that someone imagine this woman?

[Repeat 2X]
I wish you were here and I wish I was there
I wish that you, were here and, I wish I was there
The more I realize I could see her
I'm a believer, ahhhhhh...

[Cee-Lo sings over the second time]
She's a novel... a mystery book...
I like to thank you for, all the adventure
And that excitement in my life
Al-riiiiiiiiight...alright
Ooh alriiiiight baby
Aliright, you make everything alriiiiight...
Oooooh Lord, alright...
Everything alright {*fades*}
How much longer will it be?
I told myself that it was all just make believe
Close my eyes and try to breathe
I sat right down and hoped to god I'd never leave
How much longer will I dream?
I get so tired of just waking up to me
Close my eyes and try to sleep
I toss and turn until I roll back on the street
(Eddie Holland, Lamont Dozier & Brian Holland)

You are so wonderful
Being near you is all
That I'm living for
You've shown me more kindness
In little ways
Then I've ever known
In all my days

Tell me we'll stay together
Let me love your forever
'Cause you're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

In you, there is a rare quality
Your love baby
It means the world to me
For me, you're always concerned
And you ask nothing in return
You're really more than I deserve
From my heart I mean these words
You're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one
You're really more than I deserve
From my heart I mean these words
You're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

Sometimes I'm up
Oh, sometimes I'm down
But your love
You're always around
Words of confidence
You speak to me
Baby, then you place a tender kiss
On my cheek

It makes my burden
A little bit lighter
It makes my life
A little bit brighter
'Cause you're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

[Lost Lyrics]

[Lyrics from "Brian Wilson presents Smile" (2004)]

[Verse 1]
A pirate with a tune on a holiday
Ol' lazy Mr. Moon wanna getaway
And isn't that a moon for a milky way?
A ukelele lady around a lei

[Hook]
Rock, rock, roll (Child!)
Rock, rock, roll Plymouth Rock, roll over
For a holiday
With a roundelay

[Bridge]
Abash and forth, a starboard corse
With north abeam; Sherrie, of course!
The men will share some sports a-now, me hearty
Not the rum of 'carib scum, it's port tonight, drink up and come!
Aweigh the anchor, Yank! And we will party...

[Verse 2]
A shanty town, a chanty in Waikiki
And juxtapose a man with a mystery
A blue Hawaiian captures his melody
And Liliuokalani will sing for me

[Hook]
Rock, rock, roll (Child!)
Rock, rock, roll Plymouth Rock, roll over
For a holiday

[Outro]
Long, long ago, long ago

Whisperin' wind send my wind chimes a-tinklin'
Whisperin' wind send my wind chimes a-tinklin'
Whisperin' wind send my wind chimes a-tinklin'

[Verse 1]
Overhead ether flow moment
Colours run
Time, so

[Chorus]
Slow
Slow

[Verse 2]
I've never seen the arrow of time fly so

[Chorus]
Low

[Bridge]
And time flows on
Have you ever been to South Beach, tipsy with your bottles to the sky, sky, sky
There's a widows puertoricans precious gal's got that look up on her eye
Well what you drinkin'? I'm drinkin' champagne
Well I was thinkin. What, what's your campaign?
Champagne make me tipsy, patron make me sick, attitude and vodka does the trick

Somebody pour me a sex on the beach, (that's how I like it) sex on the beach, (i wanna have) sex on the beach, (your body drive me crazy) sex on the beach, (I wanna rock)

Have you ever been to Paris with a model workin on your French?
And you let her know your ballin' and the coldest players comin off the bench
Well what you smokin'? I smoke that good shit
Across the ocean, but I'm on that hood shit
Champagne make me tipsy, patron make me sick, attitude and vodka does the trick

Somebody pour me a sex on the beach, (that's how I like it) sex on the beach, (I wanna have) sex on the beach, (your body drive me crazy) sex on the beach, (I wanna rock)

If your drinking like I'm drinking put your hands in the air
If your drinking like I'm drinking put your hands in the air
If your smoking like I'm smoking put your hands in the air
If your smoking like I'm smoking put your hands in the air
If your humping like I'm humping put your hands in the air
If your humping like I'm humping put your hands in the air
If your drinking like I'm drinking put your hands in the air
If your drinking like I'm drinking put your hands in the air
Sex on the beach, (that's how I like it) sex on the beach, (I wanna have) sex on the beach, (your body drive me crazy) sex on the beach, (I wanna rock)
There are children raised in sorrow
On a scorched and barren plain
There are children raised beneath the golden sun
There are children of the water
And children of the sand
And they cry out through the universe
Their voices raised as one

I want to live I want to grow
I want to see I want to know
I want to share what I can give
I want to be I want to live

Have you gazed out on the ocean
Seen the breaching of a whale?
Have you watched the dolphins frolic in the foam?
Have you heard the song the humpback hears five hundred miles away
Telling tales of ancient history of passages and home?

I want to live I want to grow
I want to see I want to know
I want to share what I can give
I want to be I want to live
For the worker and the warrior the lover and the liar
For the native and the wanderer in kind
For the maker and the user and the mother and her son
I am looking for my family and all of you are mine

We are standing all together
Face to face and arm in arm
We are standing on the threshold of a dream
No more hunger no more killing
No more wasting life away
It is simply an idea
And I know its time has come

I want to live I want to grow
I want to see I want to know
I want to share what I can give
I want to be I want to live
If my words did glow
With the gold of sunshine
And my tunes
Were played
On the harp unstrung
Would you hear my voice
Come through the music
Would you hold it near
As it were your own?

It's a hand-me-down
The thoughts are broken
Perhaps they're better
Left unsung
I don't know
Don't really care
Let there be songs
To fill the air

Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow
Reach out your hand
If your cup be empty
If your cup is full
May it be again
Let it be known
There is a fountain
That was not made
By the hands of men

There is a road
No simple highway
Between the dawn
And the dark of night
And if you go
No one may follow
That path is for
Your steps alone

Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow

You who choose
To lead must follow
But if you fall
You fall alone
If you should stand
Then who's to guide you?
If I knew the way
I would take you home
La de da da
La da da da da da
La de da
Da da
La da da da da
La de da da da
La da da da da da
La da da da
La da da da da
Well it was early in the morning
When my blues come falling down
I want to tell you, it was early in the morning now
When my blues come falling down
Well you know, you know, it felt so, so bad
When my baby, yeah, she's been around

Whoa it was but a while after midnight
When the rooster crowed for day
Whoa it was but a while after midnight
When that rooster began to crow for day
Well I been mistreating my baby
That's about a crime that I need to pay

Come back baby
Whoa, please don't go
I said come back baby
Come on darling, please don't go
Well you know the way I love you rider
More than you ever know
Yes Lord, please stop her
I won't get drunk no more
Whoa Lord, please stop her now
I want to tell you that I won't drunk no more
Well you know she put me out in the morning
She drive this poor boy from her door
Alright...hmm...alright...hooo

A rose is a beautiful flower
To me the prettiest in the world
And that goes double, double for a girl cause she's like no other flower in the world
Remember, they're not perfect you see. So you got to take the bitter with the sweet
And remember fellas: he who picks a rose must accept the thorns it bears. (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Talking about the goood and the bad in a woman

A rose remains so pretty if you treat it with loving care (yeah yeah yeah)
And that goes double double for a girl
Treat her right and her love she'll truly share
But you've got to take the bitter with the sweet and return the lowly moments of despair
And remember fellas he who picks a rose must accept the thorns that's there...yeah yeah yeah yeah

Talking 'bout the good and bad in a woman...

I tell ya, tell ya...that a rose remains the same if you handle it with care (yeah yeah yeah)
And now that goes double double for a girl;
Treat her right and she'll stand besides you anywhere
I know sometimes they get carried away, say some things they don't mean to say
Just remember fellas: he who picks a rose must accept the thorns it bears...yeah
Talking bout the good and bad in a woman
(He who picks a rose must accept the thorns it bears)

Gotta remember when you choose your lover
(He who picks a rose must accept the thorns it bears)

The day you take one, you've got to take the other
(He who picks a rose must accept the thorns it bears)
One for the road
One for my baby
One for the road

I cry alone at night
Please tell me it's only night
And she's calling me back at night
And she's already home

One for my baby
One for the road
One for my baby
One for the road

I cry alone at night
There is no friend in sight
I love getting back at night
But I wish I don't

One for my baby
One for the road
One for my baby
One for the road
This bottle is dried up too
And I'll be all cried up soon
I can't see no God on the moon
It's a long way to go

One for my baby
One for the road
One for my baby
One for the road

I cry alone at night
He's not alone at night
I'll be there my whole night
But I wish it was whole

One for my baby
One for the road
One for my baby
One for the road
Once I had a secret love
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
And why I'm so in love with you

Now I shout it from the highest hill
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my heart's an open door
And my secret love's no secret anymore

Now I shout it from the highest hill
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my heart's an open door
And my secret love's no secret
My secret love's no secret
My secret love's no secret anymore
Sometimes it happens that you are friends
And then you are not friends
And friendship has passed
And whole days are lost and among them
A fountain empties itself

And sometimes it happens that you are loved
And then you are not loved
And love is past
And whole days are lost and among them
A fountain empties itself into the grass

And sometimes you want to speak to him
And then you do not want to speak
Then the opportunity has passed
Your dreams flare up, they suddenly vanish

And also it happens that there is nowhere to go
And then there is somewhere to go
Then you have bypassed
And the years flare up and are gone
Quicker than a minute
So you have nothing
You wonder if these things matter and then
They cease to matter
And caring is past
And a fountain empties itself into the grass

And sometimes it happens that you are loved
And then you are not loved...

[Verse 1]
The sun rose on the wrong side of the Earth this morning
Nobody noticed but you
So you winked at the sun
And the sun winked back, and you kept it to yourself
Alright

[Verse 2]
The stars are gonna give up hope this evening
Nobody knows this but you
When the small ones have imploded
And red giants have supernova'd
Then sorry the Earth will be

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
The sun rose on the wrong side of the Earth

[Verse 1]
Now that you've won me
I hope that you'll remember how
Don't you forget it, no baby
'Cause you know I love you now
Keep on bein' sweet and kind in the same old way
Keep on sayin' that you're mine, each and every day

[Refrain]
Now that you've won me
Now that you've won me

[Verse 2]
Now that you've got me
I hope our heartaches don't begin
I hope my heart was not just a bet you had to win
Keep on kissin' me day and night
Don't you ever change
Keep holdin' me tight, baby
Don't you dare start actin' strange

[Refrain]
Now that you've won me
Now that you've got me

[Verse 3]
I felt it quite a while ago, but I had to say "No"
I wouldn't admit it to myself
But I guess it's right that the truth comes to the light
I'll admit, this is it, baby
I'll admit, this is it

[Verse 4]
Now that I'm yours
I hope you keep me for you own
Don't misuse me and then leave me all alone
Keep on doing the things that you did when we first met
I hope you still remember them
I hope you don't forget

[Refrain]
Now that you've won me
Now that I'm yours
Now that you've got me
Now that you've won me
Now that I'm yours
There'll be a hot time
In the town of Berlin
When the Yanks go marchin' in
I wanna be there boy
And spread some joy
When they take old Berlin

There'll be a hot time
In the town of Berlin
When the Brooklyn boys begin
To take the joint apart
And tear it down
When they take old Berlin

They're gonna start a row
And show them how
We paint the town back, in Kokomo
They're gonna take a hike
Through Hitler's Reich
And change his 'Heil' to 'What ya know, Joe'
There'll be a hot time
In the town of Berlin
When the Yanks go marchin' in
You could never keep 'em happy down on the farm
After they take Berlin

I'm gonna grab a Frau
And show her how
We paint the town back, in Michigan
I'm gonna take a hike
Through Hitler's Reich
And change that 'Heil' to 'Gimme some skin'

There'll be a hot time
In the town of Berlin
When the Yanks go marchin' in
You know that you could never keep 'em happy down on the farm
After they take Berlin
Alright baby
Yeah

And I can erase the past oh
I can make the future shine so bright
And I can make right now alright yeah

My baby woke up this mornin'
Says B, you must clean out and go
Well, my baby woke up this mornin'
Says B, you must clean out and go
'Cause the way that you been doin'
Can't take those treatments no more

If you ever lay down at night
And wake up cold in hand
Your baby's gone and left you
She's got another man
Why, I'm gonna move, gonna move to the deep blue sea
Well, I'm tired of being all alone and livin' in misery

Well, when I woke up this mornin'
She was sittin' down before the glass
And when I start to talk
All she would do was laugh
I'm gonna change my ways
I'm gonna move to the deep blue sea
Well, I'm tired of being all alone and livin' in misery

And you knock me out, girl, come on

'Cause in the 90's you gotta respect the ladies
So step up to 'em and say, we love you sweet Sadie, uh
That's how you get your true mack on but
Brothers be stepping up, popping that sad song
Hey don't I know you from somewhere?
Can we go somewhere to be alone?
I pull up in the lot, pop the trunks, make their heads bob
And it's sunny so it's time to get a summer bunny, yeah

[Chorus]
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
(Oh, baby, you know you drive me crazy)
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
(Yeah, yeah, girl, you got it going on)
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
(Summer bunnies driving me)
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
(I really love the way you're driving me)

[Verse 2]
Uh, it's five o'clock and my voice code is 22
So beep, beep, beep, it's time for me to make a move
I'm on my way to his picnic
(Ayo R, we got time, it don't start 'til 2)
Yeah, but I wanna be early, fool
So I can catch the new bunnies coming in just like the old school
Strolling the block so I can check the scenery
The sun plays, the day is feeling good to me, huh
I can just smell the funky beats
You know the flavor "In Between the Sheets"
I saw my boy Big Al, I said, "Just keep it straight"
He said, "I know I got a novelty to validate"
So who's the bunny looking sweet like a honeycomb?
He say, "No my brother, you gots to get your own summer bunny, yeah

[Chorus]
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
(Oh, summer bunnies, oh, drive me crazy)
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
(Girl, you know you knock me out)
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
(Said I'll admit it later)
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
(I really love the way you're driving me)

[Verse 3]
This party is packed tops, word to the mother
I love it when there's three bunnies to one brother
And wine coolers is what I'm packing, yeah
And when I get my buzz on is when I start bunny-jacking
Jacking fools for their bunnies
'Cause I'm the K, the E, the double L, the Y, they wanna get with me
And the PAs in the house (huh, what up?)
So check, check, check it out
My stomach is growling so it's time to get my hungry on
Some soul food, Kool-Aid and you know it's on
Then after that I hate to eat and run but I'm outtie, my homie
Tamieka invited us to a block party
So we roll up and all I saw was thighs and daisy dukes
The fellas yelling summer bunnies, yeah

[Chorus]
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
(Oh, summer bunnies drive me crazy)
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
(Hey, hey, and you know, you know you knock me out)
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
(Hey, hey, girl, you know me out)
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
(I really love the way you knock me out)

[Bridge]
Let's break it down
You're looking feel good with your dukes on, baby (baby)
You're looking feel good with your dukes on, baby (ooh)
Yeah, yeah
You're looking feel good with your dukes on, baby (oh baby)
(Ayo Dre) ayo what up? (Check it out)
Girl, you know you knock me out
Girl, you know you knock me out
Girl, you know you knock me out
Girl, you know you knock me out, oh yeah
Girl, you know you knock me out
Girl, you know you knock me out
Girl, you know you knock me out
Girl, you know you knock me out

[Chorus]
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
(Summer bunnies)
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
(Driving me crazy, oh yeah)
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
(Oh, woah)
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
(I really love the way you knock me out)
Because he called the forest brother
Because he called the earth his mother
They drove him out into the rain
Some people even said the boy from the country was insane

Because he spoke with fish in the creek
He tried to tell us that the animals could speak
Who knows, perhaps they do
How do you know they don't
Just because they've never spoken to you

Boy from the country, he left his home when he was young
Boy from the country, he loves the sun

He tried to tell us that we should love the land
We turned our heads and laughed
And we did not understand
Sometimes I think that the boy from the country
Is the only one who sees
Because the boy from the country
Doesn't want to see the forest for the trees
Boy from the country, he left his home when he was young
Boy from the country, he loves the sun
His deeds were never published for the public
The things he did were never done for show
His name was never printed in the paper
Until about two days ago

He only filed a short form for his taxes
No one asked him how he felt about the war
He always had a good word for his neighbor
Now his good words won't be heard anymore

And through the rain I heard the choir singing
"Nearer my God to Thee"
Through the mist I saw some children crying
And I felt nearer my God to Thee

His table was never full of plenty
His silverware was never the real thing
But the tears on the faces of his family
Were just as real as if he were a king

The preacher said he'd always been a good man
But preachers love to throw that phrase around
But the tears I tasted gave his words new meaning
Watching old friends putting daddy in the ground
And through the rain I heard the choir singing
"Nearer my God to Thee"
Through the mist I saw some children crying
And I felt nearer my God to Thee
"Nearer my God to Thee"
I love you
For sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I'll give you my heart

I love you
And you alone was meant for me
Please give your loving heart to me
And say, we'll never part

I think of you every mornin'
Dream of you every night
Darling, I'm never lonely
Whenever you are in sight

I love you
For sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart

I think of you every mornin'
Dream of you every night
Darling, I'm never lonely
Whenever you are in sight
I love you
For sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart

[Verse 1]
You've changed
The sparkle in your eyes is gone
Your smile is just a careless yawn
You're breaking my heart, you've changed

[Verse 2]
You've changed
Your kisses now are so blasé
You're bored with me in every way
I can't understand, you've changed

[Chorus]
You've forgotten the words I love you
And the memories that we've shared
You've ignored all the stars up above you
I can't realize that you ever cared
You've changed

[Bridge]
You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me, I know we're through
It's all over now
You've changed

[Chorus]
You've forgotten the words I love you
And the memories that we've shared
You ignore all the stars up above you
I can't realize that you ever cared
You've changed

[Bridge]
You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me, I know we're through
It's all over now
You've changed

[Verse 1]
The street was loud from an angry crowd
And I thought of you, I thought of you, dreamer
Land of the free, no hungry bellies
Impossible, impossible dreamer

[Pre-Chorus]
In the darkest part of the night
Blue shadows conjure you
And in the brightest height of the daylight
Sometimes I blink 'cause I think I see you dreaming like you do

[Chorus]
Impossible dreamer
Impossible dreamer
Impossible dreamer
Impossible dreamer

[Verse 2]
The moon was bright, like day for night
And I thought of you, I thought of you, dreamer
No acid rain, love without pain
Impossible, impossible dreamer

[Pre-Chorus]
In the darkest part of the night
Blue shadows conjure you
And at the brightest height of the daylight
Sometimes I blink 'cause I think I see you dreaming like you do

[Chorus]
Impossible dreamer
Impossible dreamer
Impossible dreamer
Impossible dreamer

[Verse 3]
The room was dark and full of sharks
And I thought of you, I thought of you, dreamer
Give peace a chance, don't think, just dance
Impossible, impossible dreamer

[Pre-Chorus]
In the darkest part of the night
Blue shadows conjure you
And at the brightest height of the daylight
Sometimes I blink 'cause I think I see you dreaming like you do

[Chorus]
Impossible dreamer
Impossible dreamer
Impossible dreamer
Impossible dreamer
Oo-oo-oo-ooh
Oo-oo-oo-ooh
Oo-ooh

There's a world where
I can go and
Tell my secrets to
In my room
In my room
(In my room)

In this world I
Lock out all my
Worries and my fears
In my room
In my room
(In my room)

Do my dreaming and my scheming
Lie awake and pray
Do my crying and my sighing
Laugh at yesterday
Now it's dark and
I'm alone but
I won't be afraid
In my room
In my room
(In my room)

(In my room)
(In my room)
(In my room)
(In my room)
(In my room)
(In my room)
(In my room)
Could have been a spoonful of coffee
Could have been a spoonful of tea
Just a little spoon of your precious love is good enough for me
Man lies about that, man cries about that
Man dies about that, spoonful, spoonful, spoonful
Could have been a spoonful of water
Spread out on the desert sand
Just a little spoon fortifies, save you from another man
Man lies about that, man cries about that
Even dies about that, spoonful, spoonful, spoonful
Could have been a spoonful of diamonds
Could have been a spoonful of gold
Just a little spoon of your precious love to satisfy my soul
Everybody's talking about spoonful
Spoonful, spoonful, spoonful
Everybody's fighting about spoonful
I was on Miami Beach
Saw the girl of my fantasy
She was into finer things
Bathing suits and diamond belly rings

She was something like I've never seen
Made me blow the whistle like the referee
Inside her is where I plan to be
And so to get her I'd do anything
Maybe even start a family
Or even get a house in Sandy Springs
She's so lovely like a melody
So baby, won't you come and jam with me?

And she was so cool
Like the other side of a pillow
So baby, let's groove
Like an instrumental

And she was so cool
Like the other side of a pillow
So baby, let's groove
Like an instrumental
Well come on over to my place
No need to be wasting time
You really must be from Outer Space
Cause' you really is blowing my mind
Now I done been from state to state
But I ain't never seen your kind
Cause' every single time I look at you
Sends a tingling down my spine

Well girl, you must be mighty exhausted
Running these laps through my mind so often
Cause' I been falling, and I been calling
I think I need a map cause' I'm so lost in
The things you do when you brush your hair
When you take it to the side and toss it over there
And it ain't that fair, cause' the way she move
I stare

And she was so cool
Like the other side of a pillow
So baby, let's groove
Like an instrumental
And she was so cool
Like the other side of a pillow
So baby, let's groove
Like an instrumental
And she's so cool
Cool like a pool in the middle of June
I sweep her off her feet
I guess you could say that I give her the broom
And she gets so international with it
Whenever she get in the mood
Cause' she's so Australlian
Down under on my didgeridoo
And she be killing it too, yeah
When she go in for the gold
Like a gymnast move
Oh, and what they saying is true
Yeah, a lady in the bed but a freak in the room
That's why she's cooly, cooly, cooly
Like a smoothie and jacuzzi
The opposite of Judge Judy
When she on duty
And she feeling me too

And she was so cool
Like the other side of a pillow
So baby, let's groove
Like an instrumental
And she was so cool
Like the other side of a pillow
So baby, let's groove
Like an instrumental
Somebody loan me a dime
I need to call my old time, used to be
Somebody loan me a dime
Mmm, I need to call my old time, used to be
Oooo, little girl's been gone so long
You know it's worryin me
Hey, it's worryin, worryin me

I know she's a good girl
But, at that time I just didn't understand
I know she's a good girl
But, at that time I just didn't understand

You know I need, I need a helpin hand
Somebody

But, at that time I just didn't understand
Oooo, I know she's a good girl
But, at that time I just could not understand
Whoa, no

To ease my worried mind
Whoo

Ooo, you know I cried, just cried
Just like a baby, all night long

I need my baby, I need my baby here at home
Oooo, yeah
People gather round me... This is to who it may concern
I'm not tryin' to run your life but you're never too old to learn
Stop worryin' about your neighbors and the fancy things they got
'Cause if you do you'll find it's true, you're gonna wind up on the spot

Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Joneses get you down
Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Joneses get you down

You may not believe it but nine times out of ten it's true
The people you're tryin' to keep up with are tryin' to keep up too
Remember that old sayin'; "All that glitters ain't gold"
Take heed, don't ignore it, and to your money tightly hold

Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Joneses get you down
Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Joneses get you down

You're a leader yourself but you don't even know it
You're so busy followin' Joneses you ain't got time to show it
Keeping up with the Joneses, it only makes your life a mess
Bill collectors, tranquilizers and gettin' deeper in debt
You better leave the Joneses alone
You better leave ---oh leave--- the Joneses alone

Joneses got a new car today
Here's what you should say; Hooray for the Joneses
Instead you worry 'til your whole head turns gray
Worryin' about the Joneses
Remember it's their car and they're the ones who had to pay
So leave (boom boom) the Joneses alone
Your car might be old but, remember; It never fails to get you where you want to go

Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Joneses get you down
Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Joneses get you down

You're doing fine
Don't let the Joneses blow your mind

If you see somethin' you want and you know you can't afford it
Well the very next thing for you to do is start saving towards it
The Joneses have been the downfall of many a person you see
So, people, take my advice and let the Joneses be

Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Joneses get you down
Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Jones... Don't let the Joneses get you down

You're doing fine
Don't let the Joneses blow your mind
You're doing fine
Don't let the Joneses blow your mind
I went down to the crossroads
Fell down on my knees
Down to the crossroads
Fell down on my knees
I said I'm beggin' for mercy won't you take me
If you please

I went down to the crossroads
Tried to beg a ride
I went down to the crossroads
Tried to beg a ride
Nobody seemed to know me
Everybody passed me by
Take a ride

Going down toward Rosedale
Took Loretta by my side
Going down to Rosedale
Took Loretta by my side

On the riverside
One more time
You can run, you can run
Tell all my friends I'll be by
You can run, you can run

Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn!
I've grown accustomed to her face
She almost makes the day begin
I've grown accustomed to the tune that
She whistles night and noon
Her smiles, her frowns
Her ups, her downs
Are second nature to me now;
Like breathing out and breathing in
I was serenely independent and content before we met;
Surely I could always be that way again-
And yet
I've grown accustomed to her look;
Accustomed to her voice;
Accustomed to her face

(Spoken)
"Marry Freddy." What an infantile idea. What a heartless
Wicked, brainless thing to do. But she'll regret, she'll
Regret it. It's doomed before they even take the vow!
(Sung)
I can see her now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill
In a wretched little flat above a store
I can see her now, not a penny in the till
And a bill collector beating at the door
She'll try to teach the things I taught her
And end up selling flowers instead
Begging for her bread and water
While her husband has his breakfast in bed
In a year, or so, when she's prematurely grey
And the blossom in her cheek has turned to chalk
She'll come home, and lo, he'll have upped and run away
With a social-climbing heiress from New York
Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!
How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite
Will I take her in or hurl her to the walls?
Give her kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take her back or throw the baggage out?

But I'm a most forgiving man;
The sort who never could, ever would
Take a position and staunchly never budge
A most forgiving man
But, I shall never take her back
If she were even crawling on her knees
Let her promise to atone;
Let her shiver, let her moan;
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!
(Spoken)
"Marry Freddy"-h a!

(Sung)
But I'm so used to hear her say
"Good morning" ev'ry day
Her joys, her woes
Her highs, her lows
Are second nature to me now;
Like breathing out and breathing in
I'm very grateful she's a woman
And so easy to forget;
Rather like a habit
One can always break-
And yet
I've grown accustomed to the trace
Of something in the air;
Accustomed to her face
The boy gets crazy when he's sittin' at the bar
Don't you mess with Jake don't you push him to far
Rot gut whiskey and home made wine
Make a good country boy just lose his mind

Like a run away train rollin' through the night
The boy ain't got no fear
Like a race car hittin' the wall he gets hard to steer
Waitin' for the smoke to clear

OOOOHH
Betty got caught in the back of Bobby's car
Bobby got caught with his hand in the cookie jar
Her daddy blew a fuse and he went for his gun
EEEEE
Now Bobby and Betty thier on the run

Like a run away train rollin' through the nite
Nothin's gonna stop them now
Gotta keep on movin', coverin' tracks somehow
Like a run away train rollin' through the night
The kids ain't got no fear
Daddy's (wizz?) bang is the last sound Bobby's gonna hear
Ooohhh
Waitin for the smoke to clear

Daddy finally caught him in the end of his gun
Put a dead end to all of Bobby's fun
OOhh
Good God almighty, Oh heaven sakes
Betty's Daddy turned out to be Jake

Like a run away train rollin' through the nite
Jake ain't got no fear

Know the hangman judge gonna give the boy 99 years
Here sits Jake at the back of this bar
Sippin' on a nice cold beer

If the law had a clue all they'd do is look right here
When they see Jake..... waitin' for the smoke to clear

Waitin for...OOOOHHHAAA
Lightning strikes
Inside my chest to keep me up at night
Dream of ways
To make you understand my pain

Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare

If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?

Drop his name
Push it in and twist the knife again
Watch my face
As I pretend to feel no pain
Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare

If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
Just say so

How come the only way to know how high you get me
Is to see how far I fall?
God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me
But I can't break through it all
It's a heart, heartbreak

I don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight
Let's just fix this whole thing now
I swear to God we're gonna get it right
If you lay your weapon down

Red wine and Ambien
You're talking shit again
It's heartbreak warfare
Good to know it's all a game
Disappointment has a name
It's heartbreak
It's heartbreak warfare
It's heartbreak warfare
"There must be some kind of way out of here"
Said a joker to the thief
"There is too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Ploughmen dig my earth
None of them anywhere along the line
Know what any of it is worth"

"No reason to get excited"
The thief he softly spoke
"There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I we've been through that
And this not our fate
And let us not talk falsely now
The hour's getting late"

All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl
One, two, three

Now I'll tell you plainly baby, what I plan to do
Say I may be crazy woman, but I ain't no fool
Your daddy's rich mama, you're overdue
Now I ain't the one baby, been messin' with you
Got bells in your mind lady, and it's easy to see-uh
I think it's time for me to move along, I do believe

Aww, you're tryin' to put a hook in me, baby, oh, no

Now you're talkin' jive woman, when you say to me
That your daddy's gonna take us in baby, take care of me
You know and I know woman, I ain't the one
I never hurt you sweetheart, I never pulled my gun
Got bells in your mind mama, and it's easy to see-uh
I think it's time for me to move along, I do believe

Time for me to put my boots out in the street missy
Are you ready boots?
Walk on!
Well now alright there missy
Let me tell you a thing or two
How about it baby?

Now you're talkin' jive woman, when you say to me
That your daddy's gonna take us in baby, take care of me
You know and I know woman, I ain't the one
I never hurt you sweetheart, I never pulled my gun
Got bells in your mind mama, and it's easy to see-uh
I think it's time for me to move along, I do believe

Oh, I must be in the middle of some kinda conspiracy

Ohhh, nooo!

Wooooo!
Down in Utah
The guys and I dig a city called Salt Lake
It's got the grooviest kids
That's why we never get tired of Salt Lake
And the way the kids talk so cool
Is an out of sight thing
And the number one radio station
Makes the town really swing yeah
Salt Lake City we'll be coming soon

There's a park near the city, yeah
All the kids dig the Lagoon now
It's full of all kinds of girls
And rides and we'll be flyin' there soon now
And girl for girl
They've got the cutest of the Western states
They got the sun in the summer
And winter time the skiing is great yeah
Salt Lake City we'll be coming soon

Salt Lake City we'll be coming soon
We'll be coming soon
We'll be coming soon
We'll be coming soon
Softly the night wind singing
Tells me it's bringing my love to me
With every breath it's sending
Love never ending across the sea
My heart and I are trying
To keep from crying
But we are lonely
Fly little bird go winging
And please lead him home safely to me

Cucurrucucu Paloma
Cucurrucucu no llores
Las piedras jamas paloma
Que van a saber de amores

What good is my tomorrow
When filled with sorrow just like today
I need him here to hold me
Here to enfold me, always to stay
So little bird please find him
And then remind him I am so lonely
Fly little bird, go winging
And please lead him home safely to me
Cucurrucucu Paloma
Cucurrucucu no llores
Las piedras jamas paloma
Que van a saber de amores

Cucurrucucu
Cucurrucucu
Cucurrucucu
Paloma ya no lo llores

[Intro:]
Hey... Say pimp, this to everybody stretched out behind the wall
Countin' days on their calendar...
Flippin' pages, month to month
Hey man... I don't give a damn 'bout how other folks treat you man
I just wanna let you know pimp
You ain't missin' nothin' homeboy
Real talk

[Chorus:]
I know the times seem long
Just try and keep strong
Put on your headphones and rewind this song
Remember you ain't missin' nothin' homes
I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes

Hey, just now the club on hold and the broads on pause
You get home, it's gonna be waitin' on y'all
So dog, just know, for real
You ain't missin nothin' homes
I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes
On Everything

[Verse 1:]
My uncle did a decade
Came home, hit the ground runnin' gettin' paid
Like he never did a day
Hit the streets, nigga still in the same place they were
'fore we went in the chain gang
And doin' the same thing
'Cause the game go on, you only did two days in the joint
The day you get locked up and the day you go home
I know it feels like the world passin' you by
Like shit happenin' every day out there that you don't know 'bout
Everytime you call home your baby momma show out
And your partners don't even send you flicks from when they go out
But don't worry 'bout it or stress it, cause shawty know what?
The time'll do itself, all you gotta do is show up
Keep layin' down wakin' up
And thankin' the Lord
And 'fore you know it they gonna open the doors
True story, just prepare yourself for it
If you ain't got a plan what you need was a second chance
Shit, you gonna blow it!
Learn and visualize what you try to do
And do the time homeboy, don't let the time do you
They say the time just flew on the street
Hard to believe from me never but you'll see soon as you on the street

[Chorus:]
I know the times seem long
Just try and keep strong
Put on your headphones and rewind this song
Remember you ain't missin' nothin' homes
I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes

Hey, just now the club on hold and the broads on pause
You get home, it's gonna be waitin' on y'all
So dog, just know, for real
You ain't missin nothin' homes
I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes

[Verse 2:]
Probably thinkin' it's easy for me to say from here in the booth
But they showed ya, they'd put me in there with you
Right now, locked down in the state of the fed, lay in the bed
Prayin' it's over and over as you say in your head
Yeah, next time I'm a be straight
Just count down to my release date... peace of cake
My nigga Kap right now, servin' a life sentence for a murder he committed
In self defense
And in such good spirits, shawty ain't even trippin
And I could be right in there with him, no bull shittin'
He on his ninth year now, just waitin' to get out
Got me thinkin' my shit ain't even worth complainin' about
'Cause it could still be worse for sho'
So you waitin' on me to lose ho, you got to kill me first
I talked to my nigga Big Meedge, had to tell him the
Streets miss him just as much as he miss the streets
Had to let him know whenever he released
We hittin' the club like '03, this time it's on me
Yeah we laugh, reminisce for a minute and then I tell him
Just nobody ever did it as big
It'll never be the same in this city again, closest
You'll get is me and Jeezy and them
So dog, if it seems like you left behind, ten steps
Behind, just know it only gets better with time

[Chorus:]
I know the times seem long
Just try and keep strong
Put on your headphones and rewind this song
Remember you ain't missin' nothin' homes
I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes

Hey, just now the club on hold and the broads on pause
You get home, it's gonna be waitin' on y'all
So dog, just know, for real
You ain't missin nothin' homes
I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes
On Everything

[Verse 1]
Three waitresses all wearing black diamond earrings
Talking about zombies and Singapore slings
No trouble in their faces, not one anxious voice
None of the crazy you get from too much choice
The thumb and the satchel or the rented Rolls-Royce

[Chorus 1]
And you think she knows something by the second refill
You think she's enlightened as she totals your bill
You say "Show me the way to Barangrill"

[Verse 2]
Well some say it's in service, they say "humble makes pure"
You're hoping it's near Folly 'cause you're headed that way for sure
And you just have to laugh 'cause it's all so crazy
Ah, her mind's on her boyfriend and eggs over easy

[Chorus 2]
It's just a trick on you, her mirrors and your will
So you ask the truck driver on the way to the till
But he's just a slave to Barangrill

[Verse 3]
The guy at the gas pumps, he's got a lot of soul
He sings Merry Christmas for you just like Nat King Cole
And he makes up his own tune right on the spot
About whitewalls and windshields and this job he's got

[Chorus 3]
And you want to get moving and you want to stay still
But lost in the moment, some longing gets filled
And you even forget to ask "hey, where's Barangrill?"
Well, I've heard of heartbreakers but you take the cake
Ladies' man
You could charm the diamonds off a rattlesnake
Ladies' man

Ladies bring it on over when you give 'em the glance
They don't stand a chance
First, you unfold them
Then you pigeon-hole 'em, ladies' man

Well it sure takes a lot of good natured self-control
Ladies' man
When I'm so hot for you and you're so cold, so cold
Ladies' man

Why do you keep on trying to make a man of me?
Couldn't you just love me
Like you love cocaine?
Cocaine head games

Cross my heart, I swear I'm not trying to trick you
No tricks, ladies' man
It's just a straight-ahead feeling I have for you
Nothing slick, ladies' man
I guess you learn to refuse
What you think you can't handle
You're acting like a vandal
Wrecking the dream at the first bad scene

Ladies' man
Ladies' man
Ladies' man
Ladies' man
I see my dog lying under the table
I see him licking my brother's girlfriend's hand
La de da da da
La de du da de du da de du du

I can't understand those eyes that keep staring at me
I can't understand how you do what you do to me
I keep on looking for you everywhere
I can't get used to the feeling you're giving me

Bowzey wow wowzey
Bowzey wow wowzey bow wowzey bow wowzey
Du du du du
La la la la la la la la la

[Verse 1]
Oh show me the way to the next whiskey bar
Oh don't ask why, no don't ask why
For we must find the next whiskey bar
Or if we don't find the next whiskey bar

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die
I tell you, I tell you
I tell you we must die

[Chorus]
Oh moon of Alabama, it's time to say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have whiskey or you know why

[Chorus]
Oh moon of Alabama, it's time to say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have whiskey or you know why

[Verse 2]
Oh show us the way to the next little dollar
Oh don't ask why, oh don't ask why
For we must find the next little dollar
Or if we don't find the next little dollar

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die
I tell you, I tell you
I tell you we must die

[Chorus]
Oh moon of Alabama, it's time to say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have dollar or you know why

[Chorus]
Oh moon of Alabama, it's time to say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have dollar or you know why

[Verse 3]
Oh show us the way to the next little girl
Oh don't ask why, no don't ask why
For we must find the next little girl
Or if we don't find the next little girl

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die
I tell you, I tell you
I tell you we must die

[Chorus]
Oh moon of Alabama, it's time to say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have little girl or you know why

[Chorus]
Oh moon of Alabama it's time to say "auf wiedersehen"
We've lost our good old mama
And must have little girl or you know why

[Outro]
You know why
You know why
Music: Phil Lesh

Played a few times by the Grateful Dead in 1968--and not to be confused with the traditional "Oh My Darling Clementine". The lyric is not in Robert Hunter's book "Box Of Rain", but he has confirmed he wrote it

Chopped olive sandwiches, roses and wine
Cold ripe persimmons, my sweet Clementine

There's a chill in the meadow, of bottomless time
I go on, I go on, I cannot fill my cup
There's a hole in the bottom, the spring has dried up

I run through the forests of linear time
Chop through the branches and cut through the vines

I'll be back in a moment, though it may take me years
In the lava rock canyons corroded with fears
Of corruptible bodies and grief beyond tears

I'll go on till I hear the sweet voices behind
That I've left for the comfort of cold Clementine
This is the 2 Feb 1968 version:

Chopped olive sandwiches, roses and wine
Red ripe persimmons, my sweet Clementine (note 1)
I go on, I go on, I can't fill my cup
There's a hole in the bottom, the well has dried up

I run through the forest, I cut past the vine
Head through the thickets of linear time
(A field full) of voices, sweet voices behind (note 2)
I've left for the comfort of cold Clementine

Notes
(1) the 20 Jan 1968 version is "Cold ripe persimmons"
(2) the 23 Jan 1968 version is "... never was mine"

The 20 Jan 1968 version is essentially the same as the 2 Feb one, but with the first verse only. The 23 Jan 1968 version has Jerry singing the first verse, then repeating the first two lines of the first verse, followed by the third and fourth lines of the second verse

The 26 Jan 1969 version is a more complete one:

Chopped olive sandwiches, roses and wine
Cold ripe persimmons, my sweet Clementine
There's a chill in the meadow of bottomless time
I go on, I go on, I can't fill my cup
There's a hole in the bottom, the spring has dried up
Just a thought for the moment, it never was mine
Just like a (fat through) and cut past the vines
I run through the forests of linear time
I go on, I go on, I can't fill my cup

I go on, I go on, though it might take me years
In the lava rock canyons all corroded with fears
Corruptible bodies and grief beyond tears
I go on till I hear the sweet voices behind
That I've left for the comfort of cold Clementine

[Chorus: Cassie]
I still believe in your eyes
I just don't care what you've done in your life
Baby, I'll always be here by your side
Don't leave me waiting too long, please come by
And I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you

[Verse 1: Kev Nish]
Yo I'm flipping through this bizzies on the radio
Stop, something tells me you someone I never seen before
Let's go, I'm on your dial, I hit you with my style
What's you name and your sign, anything to make you mine

[Pre-Chorus: J-Splif]
All night, turn it up, that's the way we live it up
Show me love, tip it off, that's the way we'll live it up
Dirty bass, make it boom, that's the way we'll live it up
Breaking dawn going hard with you I just can't get enough

[Chorus]
I still believe in your eyes
I just don't care what you've done in your life
Baby, I'll always be here by your side
Don't leave me waiting too long, please come by
And I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you

[Verse 2: J-Splif]
I see the way that you're staring at me and not just my watch
If we ride a bucket, we'll be fly cause we hot
Me and my baby by my side, we on top
It's just me and my lady ride or die
We won't stop

[Pre-Chorus: J-Splif]
All night, turn it up, that's the way we live it up
Show me love, tip it off, that's the way we'll live it up
Dirty bass, make it boom, that's the way we'll live it up
Breaking dawn going hard with you I just can't get enough

[Chorus]
I still believe in your eyes
I just don't care what you've done in your life
Baby, I'll always be here by your side
Don't leave me waiting too long, please come by
And I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you

[Outro: Proghess]
Let me see you go up, now down
Let's turn this party up
If you got that dirty bass
Girl let me see you bounce
Let me see you go up, now down
Let's turn this party up
If you got that dirty bass
Let me see you bounce
What child is this who laid to rest
On Mary’s lap a sleeping
Who angels greet with voices sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping

This, this is Christ the king
Who shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him praise
The son the babe of Mary

So bring him incense gold and myrrh
Come peasant king to praise Him
The king of kings a glory brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him

Raise, raise the song on high
Let singing fill the earth and sky
Joy, joy for Christ is born
The babe the son of Mary
Goodnight, my love, sleep tight, my love
It's almost dawn
Remember me in your dreams

Just one more kiss and after this
I must be gone
Remember me in your dreams

The hours seemed like minutes while I held you near
The minutes will be hours till we meet again, so dear

Before we part, please take my heart
And don't forget
To remember me in your dreams

Remember me in your dreams
Remember me in your dreams

The hours seem like minutes while I held you near
The minutes will be hours till we meet again
So dear
Before we part, please take my heart
And don't forget
To remember me in your dreams

Maybe this time, I'll be lucky
Maybe this time she'll stay
Maybe this time, for the first time
Love won't wander away

She's gonna hold me fast
And I'll be home at last
Not a loser anymore
Not like the last time, and the time before

Everybody loves a winner
But nobody loves me
Mr. Peaceful, Mr. Happy
That's what I want to be

All of the odds are, in my favor
Something's bound to begin
It's gotta happen, happen sometime
Maybe this time I'll win
Mm damn this sound familiar
This sound real familiar

What remix is this (feelin' on yo booty)4x

Verse 1

Yeah
All that I hear doesn't feel right
Don't call me 'till you're all right
I listened and I heard but don't tell me. La de da
Once in a while he says good night
Will I care if sometimes he is right?
What a shame, it's the same each day. La de da...
Oh how I tried!
I just sat and then I cried
Maybe I'm wrong or will I find out when I'm gone?
There is so much fun in my leisure
Don't bother me, man, just stay there
If it's a sin, I'll convert me astray. La de da...
Come be home with me, it's not a shame for you to see
Oh let it be and you'll miss reality
If every word I said
Could make you laugh
I'd talk forever (together my love)
I ask the sky just what we had
Mmm It shone forever
(together my love my my my my my my my my my my my my my)
If the song I sing to you
Could fill your heart with joy
I'd sing forever (together my love my my my my)
Forever
Forever
I've been so happy loving you

Do do do do do do do do do together my love

Let the love I have for you
Live in your heart
And beat forever (together my love)
Forever
Forever
I've been so happy loving you
Baby just let me sing it my baby
I wanna be singin' my baby
Baby baby baby my baby
I wanna be singin'
I wanna be singin' my baby
Oh oh oh oh
My my my my my my

So I'm goin' away
Mmm but not forever
Na na na na
I gotta love you anyway

Forever
I was a stranger in the city
Out of town, were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do?

The outlook was decidedly blue
But as I walked through the dreary streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London town
Had me low and it had me down
I viewed the morning with much alarm
The British museum had lost it's charm

How long I wondered, could this thing last
But the age of miracles, it hadn't passed
For suddenly, I saw you standing right there
And in foggy London town
The sun was shining, shining, shining, shining, shining everywhere

How long, I wondered, could this thing possibly last?
But the age of miracles, it hadn't passed
For suddenly, I saw you right there
And in foggy London Town
The sun was shining everywhere
Oh baby, please, baby please set a date
Baby, please, baby, please set a date
Don't you wait until tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow may be too late

When I get you in my arms
You know my heart gets full of proud
When I get you in my arms
You know my heart gets full of proud
When you whisper, "Daddy, daddy"
You know my love comes tumbling down

Well, I love you so much, baby
I love you better than I do myself
Well, I love you so much, baby
I love you better than I do myself
Well, if I can't have you, baby
I don't want nobody else

Oh baby, please, baby please set a date
Baby, please, baby, please set a date
Don't you wait until tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow may be too late
Oooooooooooh (I know what you're going through)
Come to me (I can see it in tour eyes)
Oh baby (c'mon)
Come to daddy (you know I ain't got no problem with this)
Oooooh (just say the word, I come and get you)
Come to me, yeah
(whatever you want me to do, I'll do it for you)

Well it's obvious to me that he don't love you
Baby can't you see I'm that player for you
Baby talk to me help me understand
How can you go on putin up with this man
Going out your way to make him happy
Don't'appreciate all that you give
Time to take a stand no more second chance
If you feel this way than baby take my hand

Chorus Come to daddy let me
Please your body tonight
(since he) Since won't do it right
Come to daddy let me (let me)
Please your body tonight
(since he) Since he won't do it right
It seams like everything you do for him just stop right
Same got damn excuse
Got a head ake tonight
How can you ignore
The slammin'of a door
Open up your eyes it's not the same no more
Girl you need a life with someone who is gonna love you
Treat you like god let you free and
Guide you
Time to say ok
About to make a change
Don't mean no player hate
But baby come my way

Chorus

All I wanna do is get next to you
Baby I can understand what you're going through
It don't have to be this way if you don't want it to
Baby call him up and tell him that "I'm leaving you'

Chorus 2x
Rainy day, rain all day
Ain't no use in gettin' uptight
Just let it groove its own way
Let it drain your worries away yeah
Lay back and groove on a rainy day hey
Lay back and dream on a rainy day
Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Lay back
Oh yeah !

Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Lay back and dream on a rainy day
Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Lay back and dream on a rainy day
Lay back and, lay back, lay back, lay back and groove

Ooh
Aaaah !

Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Lay back and dream on a rainy day
Still rainin' still dreamin'
Do I have to have sleepless nights?
Do my days have to be so blue?
Do I have to have sleepless nights?
Do my days have to be so blue?
Will I have to suffer for the rest of my life?
Just because I'm so in love with you

Will the sun have to shine
In this poor heart of mine?
Will the sun have to shine
In this poor heart of mine?
Or will it just keep on rainin'
Will it just keep on rainin' all the time?

The nights in my lonely room
I wake up from my sleep just to cry
The nights in my lonely room
I wake up from my sleep just to cry
You know I'll be thinking about you, baby
Every night about this time
The people think I'm crazy
Think I don't have too much to say
The people think I'm crazy
Think I don't have too much to say
But you'll never know how I feel, people
Until you've been hurt this way
Stuck inside these four walls
Sent inside forever
Never seeing no one nice again
Like you, mama
You, mama, you
If I ever get out of here
Thought of giving it all away
To a registered charity
All I need is a pint a day
If I ever get out of here
If we ever get out of here
Well, the rain exploded with a mighty crash
As we fell into the sun
And the first one said to the second one there
"I hope you're having fun
Band on the run
Band on the run
And the jailer man and Sailor Sam
Were searching everyone
For the band on the run
Band on the run
For the band on the run
Band on the run
Well, the undertaker drew a heavy sigh
Seeing no one else had come
And a bell was ringing in the village square
For the rabbits on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run
And the jailer man and Sailor Sam
Were searching everyone
For the band on the run
Band on the run
Yeah, the band on the run
The band on the run
The band on the run
Band on the run
Well, the night was falling as the desert world
Began to settle down
In the town they're searching for us everywhere
But we never will be found
Band on the run
Band on the run
And the county judge, who held a grudge
Will search forever more
For the band on the run
For the band on the run
The band on the run, yeah
The band on the run, yeah
Lord, I've got to keep on moving
Lord, I've got to get on down
Lord, I've got to keep on moving
Where I can't be found
Lord, they're coming after me

I've been accused for the killin'
Lord knows I didn't do
For hangin' me, they are willin', yeah, yeah
And that's why I've got to get on thru
Lord, they're coming after me (a-one more time)

(I say) Lord, I've got to keep on moving
Lord, I've got to get on down
Lord, I've got to keep on moving
Where I can't be found
Lord, they're coming after me

(Now, listen) I've got two boys and a woman
They're just gonna suffer now
Lord, forgive me for not goin' back
But I'll be there anyhow
I'll be there anyhow (one more time)
(I say) Lord, I've got to keep on moving
Lord, I've got to get on down
Lord, I've got to keep on moving
Where I can't be found
Lord, they're coming after me

Now, maybe someday I'll find a piece of land
Somewhere not by near anyone
Then I'll send for my love, love, love, love, sweet woman
And my two grown up son
My two grown up son (yeah, yeah ...)

(I say now) Lord I've got to keep on moving ...

[Verse 1]
Marlena under Foster Grants
She's undercover from the dawn's advance
That girl is travel-drained
And the neon mercury vapor stained Miami sky, it's red as meat
It's a cheap pink rose
Otis in the driver's seat
Watches the street lights fade away
On louvered blocks in green sea air
In fluorescent fossil yards
Slippers are shuffling into folding chairs
Freckled hands are shuffling cards

[Chorus]
They've come for fun and sun
While Muslims stick up Washington

[Verse 2]
Otis empties out the trunk
On the steps of that celebrated dump
Sleazing by the sea
Bow down to her royal travesty
In her ballrooms heads of state
In her bedrooms rented girls
Always the grand parades of cellulite
Jiggling to her golden pools
Through flock and cupid colonnades
They jiggle into surgery
Hopefully beneath the blade
They dream of golden beauty

[Chorus]
They've come for fun and sun
While Muslims stick up Washington

[Verse 3]
Marlena, white as stretcher sheet
Watches it all from her 10th floor balcony
Like it's her opera box
All those Pagliacci summer frocks
Otis is fiddling with the TV dial
All he gets are cartoons and reruns
She taps her glass with an emery file
Watching three rings in the sun
The golden dive, the fatted flake
And sizzle in the mink oil
It's all a dream she has awake
Checked into Miami Royal

[Chorus]
Where they've come for fun and sun
While Muslims hold up Washington

[Outro]
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Today I passed you on the street and my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side and he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly, I got that old time feeling
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

It's hard to know, another's lips will kiss you
And hold you just the way I used to do
Oh, Heaven only knows how much I miss you
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

If you turn me down once more, I'll join the French Foreign Legion
Bet you, they would welcome me, with open arms

First you love me, yes; then you love me, no
I don't know where I stand
Do we march together down the isle
Or do I march that desert sand

If you think I won't find romance, in the French Foreign Legion
Think about that uniform with all its charm
Just one more time are you gonna be mine, or au revoir cheri
It's the French Foreign Legion for me
Weep they will, will the lads down the street
When they find that you're promised to me
Weep they will, as their hearts lose a beat
At the thought you'll no longer be free

Oh, smug am I, warm and snug am I
When you're close in my arms, just like this
It's so easy to see they're jealous of me
There's so much love they will miss

Weep they will at the sound of the news
That we're seen all over the town
Eyes will fill but they still will refuse
To believe that you've turned them all down

I don't blame them, I don't blame them
They've lost a sweet victory
And weep they will, oh, weep they will
When they find you're promised to me

I don't blame them, I don't blame them
They've lost a sweet victory
Oh, weep they will, oh, weep they will
When they find you're promised to me
Get up and jump, get up and jump, get up, get up, get up and jump
Jump on up
Jump on down
Just jump a jump a jump a jump a jump around
Jump the day away
Jump all over town
'Cause jumpin' is okay in a jumpin' kinda way, hey hey

Jump for joy

Keep your heart muscle pumpin'
Hillel be jumpin' on that little baby frumpkin
Say what, You got a pumpkin in your pants?

When you're just standing or sitting still
Think about the frogs gettin' a thrill
Take a little lesson from the kangaroos
Don't you know they're jumpin' foos, jump you!
Jump a nun
Jump a Jack
Jump for fun
Jump back
How's about us jumpin' in the sack?
And now, it's time for a jump attack

[Verse 1]
Light up, light up, light up your lazy blue eyes
Moon's up, night's up, takin' the town by surprise
Night time, night time, day left an hour ago
City light time, must you get ready so slow?
There are places to come from and places to go

[Chorus]
Night in the city looks pretty to me
Night in the city looks fine
Music comes spilling out into the street
Colors go flashing in time

[Verse 2]
Take off, take off, take off your stay-at-home shoes
Break off, shake off, chase off those stay-at-home blues
Stairway, stairway, down to the crowds in the street
They go their way looking for faces to greet
But we run on laughing with no one to meet

[Chorus 2]
Night in the city looks pretty to me
Night in the city looks fine
Music comes spilling out into the street
Colors go waltzing in time

[Verse 1: Wanya Morris]
I used to think that you were down, yeah, yeah
I used to think that you were down
Oh, but when times got rough I saw the truth
I thought I found a design of love that could be real life, yeah
But our hearts drifted apart
They no longer bind, yeah yeah
Nothing's alright, you're out of my mind, yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
I remember when you wouldn't come around
(Whoa whoa yeah)
Now you wanna be down
(Wanna be down with me)
And I'm supposed to let you back, no way
(No, no way, no way)
I remember that day so well
(So well, so well, yeah)
When you wouldn't talk to me
Now you see me every day on TV

[Verse 2: Wanya Morris]
You tried to play me and got played in return, yeah, yeah
Messed up on a real man, now your bridges are burned, woo, huh
Gave me time to figure out your scheme, it's all a dream now, whoa oh
Trying to get back in and you don't know how
Now you're out of order and out of mind, yeah yeah, hey

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
I remember when you wouldn't come around
(Oh)
Now you wanna be down
(Now you wanna be down with me)
And I'm supposed to let you back, no way
(No way, woo)
I remember that day so well
(I, I, I)
When you wouldn't talk to me
Now you see me every day on TV
I remember when you wouldn't come around
(I remember)
Now you wanna be down
(Now you wanna be down)
And I'm supposed to let you back, no way
(No way)
I remember that day so well
(So well, so well, so well)
When you wouldn't talk to me
Now you see me every day on TV

[Bridge: Wanya Morris]
Gave me time to figure out your scheme it's all a dream now
Whoa oh, oh oh oh
You're trying to get back in and you don't know how
There's no way no how

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
I remember when you wouldn't come around
Now you wanna be down

And I'm supposed to let you back, no way

Oh oh, oh oh, yeah yeah

No way, yeah yeah, oh oh
There's a change in your loving
Strange kind of loving
A change in your loving
You are cold to the touch
Change in your loving
Strange kind of loving, baby
A change in your loving
Once you loved me so much

You started a fire
Inside of me
My burning hot body
Was a hundred and three
But lately I'm feeling
A drop in temperature
You're cooling down, baby
And I'm begging for more

There's a change in your loving
Strange kind of loving
A change in your loving
You are cold to the touch
Change in your loving
Strange kind of loving, baby
A change in your loving
Once you loved me so much

With you I was feeling
So secure
When I was down and had the blues
You had the cure
Now things are so different
But I believe I understand
I may be sharing your lips
With another man

Change in your loving
Strange kind of loving

A change in your loving
You are cold to the touch
There's a change in your loving
Strange kind of loving, baby
A change in your loving
Once you loved me so much

A change in your loving
A change in your loving
There's something missing in the way you say hello, baby
Your words don't have that feeling anymore
Every time you hold me in your arms
It seems we're miles apart
Am I the one you're holding in your heart?

There's something missing in the way your lips touch mine, baby
I miss the flame that came with every kiss
Is it only my imagination at play
That tells me that there is someone new
Or must I really go on missing you?

Musical interlude
Is it only my imagination at play
That tells me that there is someone new
Or must I really go on missing you?

[Verse 1]
You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey baby, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's stay out tonight
You like me and I like it all
You love dancing and you look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast

[Pre-Chorus]
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Chorus]
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so

[Verse 2]
You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey baby, let's stay out tonight
You like me and I like it all
You love dancing and you look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast

[Pre-Chorus]
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Yeah

[Chorus]
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so

[Verse 3]
You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey baby, your hair's alright
Hey baby, let's stay out tonight
Stay out tonight
Stay out tonight
(I saw you first.) Now wait a minute. (Nobody else is gonna get you)
(I saw you first.) Yeah, I mean it. (Nobody else is gonna catch you.)
(You smiled at me, that was my lucky break,)
(Gave you that double take, except to myself)
Quote (Oh Frankie!) unquote (You gave advice) I did?
(I suddenly found myself in clover.)
(I tumbled flat) You sure did. (that was the time that you took over)
(If someone else wants to try this love scene,) with me?
What do I tell em, baby? (Just tell them I saw you first.)
I'll try to remember that I saw you first. (Lay?) Baby I should have seen you sooner
I saw you first. (Oh gee) think you could ever stand the crooner? (Uh huh)
You smiled at me, that was my lucky break, gave you that double take
Except to myself (What did you say?) That does it!
You gave it this, I was like a clown in clover
And that first kiss, that was the time that you took over
So if my other love affair should go and burst, remember I saw you first
I don't drink as much as I used to
Lately it just ain't my style
And the hard times don't hurt like they ought to
They pass quicker like when I's a child

Somehow I've learned how to listen
For a sound like the sun goin' down
In the magic the morning is bringing
There's a song for the life I have found
It keeps my feet on the ground

Don't the midsummer days sit so heavy
But don't they flow like a breeze through your mind
And nothin occurs in a hurry
To make up for someone's lost time

Somehow I've learned how to listen
For a sound like the sun goin down
In the magic the morning is bringing
There's a song for a friend I have found
She keeps my feet on the ground
Somehow I've learned how to listen
For a sound like the breeze dyin down
In the magic the morning is bringing
There's a song for the life Ihave found
It keeps my feet on the ground

[Intro: R. Kelly]
Oooooo weee!
Ho, ho
Guess who?

Nelly you ready?
(Uh-huh)
Y'all ready?
(Uh-huh)
Okay, let's go

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
I pull up to the club stepping fresh up out the hummer
Got a lot of cash on me, I'm a number one stunner
In the middle of the winter, make it feel like summer
What I'm doing? (Hey hey)
I'm tryna get a number
I pull up to the club stepping fresh up out the hummer
Got a lot of cash on me, I'm a number one stunner
In the middle of the winter, make it feel like summer
What I'm doing? (Hey hey)
I'm tryna get a number

[Verse 1: Nelly]
Half you niggas goin' 'bout it all wrong (all wrong)
Lemme tell you what might help to get her home (get her home)
You think that lame ass demeanor gon' make her wan' come and see ya
Should've listened to B.I.G., you dead wrong (dead wrong)
First, you get your swagga right
Then, go stand right by that light
Let that light hit off that ice
Lookin' like you landin' flights
That shit there like kryptonite
She tryna put up a fight
But she can't help it, she enticed
She done looked like more than twice
St. Louis (yeah), Chi-town (yeah)
This a lot of money mama this ain't even fair
They climbin' on the tables and they standin' on the chairs
They tryna get a glimpse of what the hell is over there
Then pop, pop, pop, go a round of bottles
Then pop, pop, pop, R. Kelly follows
This shit here like hard to swallow
Only real niggas endure this power
Only real niggas give paper showers, 3 or 4 grand like every hour
And I don't give a fuck who else in town
Midwest come through, shut this bitch down!

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
I pull up to the club stepping fresh up out the hummer
Got a lot of cash on me, I'm a number one stunner
In the middle of the winter, make it feel like summer
What I'm doing? (Hey hey)
I'm tryna get a number
I pull up to the club stepping fresh up out the hummer
Got a lot of cash on me, I'm a number one stunner
In the middle of the winter, make it feel like summer
What I'm doing? (Hey hey)
I'm tryna get a number

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
I'm in the club and I'm sipping on Patron
And I'ma be up in this bitch all night long
So many my baby mommas, I'm scoping out like a hunter
I'm tryna see which of them I'm taking home
Look at her, look at her, I like her, go get her
Fuck it, go get them, let all of them bitches in
Got a lot of cash and I'm ready to spend it all
I'm so high in this muh'fucker I can't see y'all
Before you take a picture (hee), give me time to pause
And it go like suit (uh huh), my ice (uh huh), my stunnas now pause
R. Kelly (that's what's up)
Kells and Nelly (that's what's up)
Get that paper (that's what's up)
Fuck them haters (that's what's up)
Hey y'all got the game all misconstrued

And talk some sense in y'all fools, looky here
Playa let me tell ya what's happening
Get that number keep it proud
Tell that bitch to write it down
Shake yo' hand and give you that now

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
I pull up to the club stepping fresh up out the hummer
Got a lot of cash on me, I'm a number one stunner
In the middle of the winter, make it feel like summer
What I'm doing? (Hey hey)
I'm tryna get a number
I pull up to the club stepping fresh up out the hummer
Got a lot of cash on me, I'm a number one stunner
In the middle of the winter, make it feel like summer
What I'm doing? (Hey hey)
I'm tryna get a number

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
I'm gettin my drink on, I got my stunnas on
Just stop the music you can hear this on ya ringtone

Wake up with two chicks, wash our ass and goin' straight to the mall
(Now gimme that number)

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
I pull up to the club stepping fresh up out the hummer
Got a lot of cash on me, I'm a number one stunner
In the middle of the winter, make it feel like summer
What I'm doing? (Hey hey)
I'm tryna get a number
I forgot to remember to forget her
I can't seem to get her off my mind
I thought I'd never miss her
But I found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time
The day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we ever met
But something sure is wrong
'Cause I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget
The day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we ever met
Well, but something sure is wrong
'Cause I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget
She belongs there, left with her liberty
Never known as a non-believer
She laughs and stays in the
Won- won- wonderful

She knew how to gather the forest when
God reached softly and moved her body
One golden locket quite young
And loving her mother and father

Farther down the path was a mystery
Through the recess the chalk and numbers
A boy bumped into her
Won- won- won- wonderful

She'll return in love with her liberty
Never known as a non-believer
She'll smile and thank God
For one won- won- wonderful

Na na na na na na na
We look like we know what we're doing
When they ask us to play
Only takes two or three minutes
To warm up and give it our best
And beat all the rest
The girls in the stands and all of our fans

We're for our team yeah
You'll never lose it
With us you're still number one

We run out onto the court
We're playing our favorite sport
We don't care about the big guys
We're taking them down to our size
And we get a rise
From the girls in the stands and all of our fans

Yeah

We're for our team yeah
You'll never lose it
With us you're still number one
Give it our best
And beat all the rest
For the girls in the stands and all of our fans

We're for our team yeah
You'll never lose it
With us you're still number one

You'll never lose it
With us you're still number one

You'll never lose it
With us you're still number one

You'll never lose it
With us you're still number one
Well it was early in the morning
When my blues come falling down
I want to tell you, it was early in the morning now
When my blues come falling down
Well you know, you know, it felt so, so bad
When my baby, yeah, she's been around

Whoa it was but a while after midnight
When the rooster crowed for day
Whoa it was but a while after midnight
When that rooster began to crow for day
Well I been mistreating my baby
That's about a crime that I need to pay

Come back baby
Whoa, please don't go
I said come back baby
Come on darling, please don't go
Well you know the way I love you rider
More than you ever know
Yes Lord, please stop her
I won't get drunk no more
Whoa Lord, please stop her now
I want to tell you that I won't drunk no more
Well you know she put me out in the morning
She drive this poor boy from her door

[Verse 1: Yolanda Adams]
Christmas is the day
The angels came to say
They said be not afraid
For born on this day
Born to save is Christ the Lord
Shepherds watched by night
When that angel appeared from on high
And said be not afraid for born on this day
Born to save is Christ the Lord
Christ the Lord

[Verse 2]
Wise men from afar
Said they followed the eastern star
Followed it to this place
For born on this day
Born to save is Christ the Lord

[Chorus: Yolanda Adams]
Born this day
Christmas day
Born to save the world is Christ the Lord
Born this day
Christmas day
Born to save the world is Christ the Lord
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Bridge: Yolanda Adams, Choir]
They said be not afraid (Be not afraid)
For born on this day (For born on this day)
Born to save is Christ the Lord
Christ The Lord
He's God the Father, God the Son, and Holy Spirit
Jesus

[Verse 3: Yolanda Adams, Choir]
Christmas is the day
When the angels appeared to say
They said be not afraid (Be not afraid)
For born on this day (Ooh-ooh)
Born to save is Christ the Lord

[Chorus: Yolanda Adams, Choir]
Born this day (Born this day)
Christmas day (Christmas day)
Born to save the world is Christ the Lord
(Born to save the world on this day)
Born this day (Christmas day)
Christmas day (Born to save the world)
Born to save the world is Christ the Lord

Born to save the world is Christ the Lord
(Christ the Lord)
Born this day (Jesus)

Born to save the world is Christ the Lord

[Outro: Yolanda Adams]
Born to save the world is Christ the Lord
He is Lord, Lord of lords
They said be not afraid
For born on this day
Born to save our lives
His name is Jesus Christ
He is Emmanuel
He is Christ
And he is born to save
He's Christ the Lord
Autumn colors have gone
Birds fled south with their song
Snowflakes cover the earth quietly
Night extends through the hours
Cooly lit by the stars
The pulse of life slows silently

Cuddle up in a cozy nook
With a warm drink and a book
Within a winter symphony

Somewhere children outside
Screamin' down a daredevil slide
Rosy-cheeked bundles of cold-weather clothes
Hear the winter winds howl
Pierced by the hoot of an owl
Fingers of frost take a nip at my nose

Cuddle up in a cozy nook
With a warm drink and a book
Within a winter symphony
Winter symphony
Snowflake fantasy
Warms my heart like a tropic sea
There the sun always shines
There you'll always be mine
All in a winter symphony

Winter symphony
Snowflake fantasy
Warms my heart like a tropic sea
There the sun always shines
There you'll always be mine
All in a winter symphony
I'd rather be sloppy drunk than anything I know
I'd rather be sloppy drunk than anything I know
Another half a pint, then you'll see me go

My gal done quit me, for somebody else
Oh my gal done quit me, for somebody else
Now I'm sloppy drunk again
Sleeping all by myself

Oh I love my whiskey
Tell the world I do
Oh I love my whiskey
Telling the world I do
And my reason for drinking'...
Tryin' to get along with you

Oh I drink while I'm up
Drink until I fall
I'm gonna drink while I'm up
Drink until I fall
If you tryin' to stop me drinkin
Ain't saying nothing at all
Oh, hey bartender
Bring another half a pint
Oh, hey bartender
Bring another half a pint
Two or three more drinks
I'm gonna raid this joint

Yes! I'm sloppy drunk again
I don't care who knows
Yeahow!

[Intro: Mike]
It's gettin' kinda dark already, should I light 'em?

[Verse 1: Nathan & Shawn]
Hey baby I'm ready, I'm oh so ready
I wanna make love to you, hey
Take 'em off, throw 'em down
Come here and let me feel what's in front of me
The outside world is of no concern
Just let our bodies and the candles in the room burn
With a feverish passion uncontained

[Chorus: All]
Feels like one of those nights
Lady, I'm in need of love in a hurry
50 candles burn bright
And all is alright, as our bodies unite
Take our time, do it right

[Verse 2: Wanya & Shawn]
Give me your hand touch me right here
Oh so good want it more and more
Each moment yours fingers linger all around
As I kiss you in the place where your composure comes undone
And your mind runs
We'll make love 'til the sun completely rises
Come play with me
Let me be the toy
That fulfills your needs
'Cause I'm yours tonight and you're all mine, roll with me
Don't be afraid let the feeling take you away
To a world of ecstasy
Where all you got to do is be free and give your all and all

[Chorus: All]
Feels like one of those nights
Lady, I'm in need of love in, in a hurry
50 candles burn bright
And all is right, as our bodies unite
Take our time, do it right

[Verse 3: Mike]
Come and get this, waited all my life for your touch and soft kiss
And life will never be the same, while ya moan and groan
I hear your voice call my name
Holding your body like a plastic molding
Your soul I'll be controlling
As the candles burn, we toss and we turn
From night to day, all our pleasures we learn
Come and play with me, (play with me) tonight's our night baby
50 candles burn bright
Come and roll with me
Make love to me
Hold on tight
It's going to be a bumpy ride

[Chorus: All]
Feels like one of those nights
Lady, I'm in need of love in a hurry
50 candles burn bright
And all is right, as our bodies unite
Take our time, do it right
Wait for me
My love, my restless heart must roam
Wait for me
My love and I'll be coming home

But now I can't change
Something strange roars me on
My love can't you see
I'm not free till it's gone

Wait for me, my love
For I am young in dream
And my heart
Must chase those ripples on the stream

So keep faith in your heart
Keep your love ever true
For if you felt like me
I'd wait for you

So keep faith in your heart
Keep your love ever true
For if you felt like me
I'd wait for you
I believe, I believe
I believe in wishing wells
But I also believe in a lot of things
Things the daisy tells
I believe, I believe that a four-leaf clover brings
Lots of luck, lots of joy, lots of happiness
I believe those things
And when it's Christmas time I believe in Santa Claus
Why do I believe, I guess that I believe because
I believe, I believe
I believe that dreams come true
If you wish for a dream by a wishing well
Don't tell your wish or you'll break the spell

It may sound naive, but that's what I believe

And when it's Christmas
I try to believe in Santa Claus
Why do I believe
I guess that I believe because
I believe, I believe
I do believe that dreams come true
And if you wish for a dream by the wishing well
Don't you tell the wish or you'll break the spell
It may sound naive
But that's what I happen to believe
'Twas just a garden in the rain
Close to a little leafy lane
A touch of color 'neath skies of gray

The raindrops kissed the flower beds
The blossoms raised their thirsty heads
A perfumed "thank you" they seemed to say

Surely here was charm beyond compare to view
Maybe it was just that I was there with you

'Twas just a garden in the rain
But then the sun came out again
And sent us happily on our way

'Twas just a garden in the rain
But then that sun came out again
And sent us happily on our way

[Intro: Mike & Wanya]
Hey, what's wrong squirt?
I don't know man. Sometimes around this time of year I just get depressed
Man, this isn't the time of year to be depressed
It's the time to be happy and giving, man
You know
Sometimes I think about things that are happening in the world today
Things I didn't have. I just feel like crying
We all feel that way sometimes. But, it'll be alright
I just, I just wonder why

[Verse 1]
Every day at this time of year
I wonder time and time again
Why are kids suffering?
All of the tears 'cause being caught in the crossfire (Why?)
Somebody tell me why
As the joyous day comes along
The eldest feel there's something wrong
He's looking for Mom but she's not there
Kids are looking for reindeer in the air

[Chorus]
She messed up again
Why?
My brother and my sister
They ain't got no toys
What am I supposed to do
When growing up for me wasn't joy?
It's gonna be a why Christmas
It's gonna be, it's gonna be a
A why Christmas

[Verse 2]
No one was there but Grandma and her friends
A time of heartache is setting in
There's nothing I can do
Just sit and feel pain run me through
I often wished they were never born
The thought of them not having no toys
Their little hearts were torn
I was young and I cried as well
I didn't have a job
But I prayed to the Lord that there'd be better days
Yes, he gave me a reason to live
He gave me a sign
But I still think to that day when

[Chorus]
She messed up again
Why?
My brother and my sister
They ain't got no toys
What am I supposed to do
When growing up for me wasn't joy?
It's gonna be a why Christmas
It's gonna be, it's gonna be a
A why Christmas

[Bridge]
Brother and my
Brother and my
Brother and my
Sister
Brother and my
Brother and my
Brother and my
Sister

[Chorus]
She messed up again
Why?
My brother and my sister
They ain't got no toys
What am I supposed to do
When growing up for me wasn't joy?
It's gonna be a why Christmas
It's gonna be, it's gonna be a
A why Christmas

After all the jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
Footsteps dressed in red
And the wind whispers Mary
A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterdays life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife
And the wind, it cries Mary
The traffic lights, they turn, uh, blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags down stream
'cause the life that lived is
Is dead
And the wind screams Mary
Uh-will the wind ever remember
The names it has blow in the past?
And with this crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
It whispers no, this will be the last
And the wind cries Mary
I remember Monday
Rising up to pack his lunch
We kissed goodbye saying
What a foolish girl was I
Saying, what a fool was she
Near the store where I go shopping
On display there was a golden watch chain
All that week it had me stopping
What a fool was she

Almost Christmas, we were so poor
Where there was will
There were ways
I was sure

In the paper written plain
I saw an ad, I caught a train
And sold my hair to buy the chain
What a fool was she

And he says
I remember Monday rising with her hair
Reflected in my eyes
It caught the sun a million times
What a fool was he
In a window near the office was a comb
Of pearls and beads and tortoise
Oh, the devil'd come to court us
What a fool was he
Almost Christmas, we were so poor
Where there was will
There were ways
I was sure

In the pawnshop coming home
I stopped inquiring for a loan
And sold the watch to buy the comb
What a fool was he

Christmas came up cold and glum
There were no visions of sugar plums
There were no joyous carols sung
Oh, what fools were they
He sat glaring at her bob
As she lay weeping by a chain and fob
And sadly burned the yule log
And wise men lost their way
Wisemen lose their way
Merry Christmas Day
For once in my life
I have someone who needs me
Someone I've needed so long

For once I'm afraid I can go where life leads me
And somehow know I'll be strong

For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew, someone warm like you
Would make my dreams come true

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before

For once I have something I know won't desert me
And I'm not alone anymore

For once I can say; this is mine you won't take it
Long as I know I have love I can make it
For once my life I have someone who needs me
For once I can say; this is mine you can't take it
Long as I know I got love I can make it
For once in my life I've got someone
Yeah, for once in my life I found someone
For once in my life, I've got someone
Who needs me
What am I going to do

Since you went away
I ain't had nothing much to say, no
I been keeping to myself the reasons why you left
I walked around bewildered
Because she caught me in the wrong
There was nothing I could say
To keep her from leaving home

I'll never find another love like yours in a lifetime
In a lifetime baby
I'll never find another love like yours in a lifetime
In a lifetime

I know that I was wrong
Because you can't share love with two

I just took a chance
A chance on losing you
I lost my pride and joy because
I was careless with her heart
I didn't believe nothing could ever tear us apart
I'll never find another love like yours in a lifetime
In a lifetime baby
I'll never find another love like yours in a lifetime
In a lifetime baby

I'll never find (oh never find)
Another love (never ever find)
In a lifetime, in a lifetime
Oh I'll never find (oh never find)
Another love (never ever find)
In a lifetime, in a lifetime

It'll shake your world over
I ain't never found no loving like you do
I'll never find another love like yours in a lifetime
In a lifetime
In a lifetime baby
I'll never find another love like yours in a lifetime
In a lifetime
In a lifetime baby

But I need to know some things about ya

Oh, I wanna be the man that makes you feel

If you roll with me tonight

Baby I wanna do
Whatever's on your mind
You'll make it all come true
If you roll with me tonight
Baby I wanna do
Whatever's on your mind
You'll make it all come true
If you roll with me tonight
Once upon a time there was a toy soldier
And he lived in the play room
Once upon a time there was a toy soldier
With a whip lash in his hand

And every night little girl Sadie would take all her clothes off
And wind up the toy soldier and he'd raise his whip and say to her:

"On your knees little Sadie
Little Sadie on your knees
Taste the whip in love not given lightly
Taste the whip and bleed for me"

Little Sadie loved her little toy soldier
And she run home from school each day
Little Sadie loved her little toy soldier
And she'd lock the door so she could play

Little Sadie got ambitious
And wound the clockwork soldier tighter
So he could whip her harder and harder
"On your knees little Sadie
Little Sadie on your knees
Taste the whip in love not given lightly
Taste the whip and bleed for me"

One day Sadie wound and wound
And wound and wound
And wound and wound

Til suddenly the little toy soldier's spring, went (boing) (screams)

And he beat her to death! (explosions) (nose blowing)

(Speaking Clock)
"At the first stroke it will be two twenty-one and twenty seconds"
Walk down this road
When the road gets rough
I fall down
I get up

I am what I am (am what I am, am what I am, am what I am)
A Family Man (A Family Man)
I am what I am (am what I am, am what I am, am what I am)

Mother... Father... Brother
Mother... Father... Brother

Walk down this road
In the cool of the night
Don't know what's wrong
But I do know what'S right

I am what I am (am what I am, am what I am, am what I am)
A Family Man (A Family Man)
I am what I am (am what I am, am what I am, am what I am)

Lie down, (fair 1//pheromone), and come away
Till the rain is over and gone
G-G-Gimme the beat now (Face the music)
Lead line (Face the music)

If the air is a little thick in this room 2nite
I reckon it's the result of an onslaught of separatist rookies
Overcome by this colorful sight

Talkin' so fast that even they
Talkin' so fast that even they
Don't know what they mean

Of all the things that base a rhyme
How is it that U everytime
Regurgitate the racist lines that keep us apart?

Thank God this ain't Monopoly
U'd make us all go back 2 start

Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Race
Face the music
We all bones when we dead
Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Cut me, cut U
Both the blood is red

I gotcha

Race
Race

Check it

Three seats over there's a lady black
Entrusted 2 her care is a little white girl
And the fact of the matter is

Before her momma or another kid at school
Tells her about the fallacy that 1 race rules over the other
She'd be a much-better-off-left fool (Face the music)

If we never heard about the evils that those before us committed
Then how my dear, tell me now how my dear, tell me now how now would we know

And then the band say

Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Race
Face the music
We all bones when we dead
Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Cut me, cut U
Both the blood is red

I gotcha

Race
Race
(Face the music)

D-d-down with H-I-S-T-O-R-Y and all this BS propagandi
Keepin U from me and me from U as we grow
I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
Why those before us hated each other

I'd rather believe they never did
I'd rather believe (I'd rather, I'd rather believe)
That there's hope 4 a kid

And if he imitates the best
I guess that's what I'll try 2 be
And I will let the rest dissolve with my guitar underneath the sea

Race

Face the music (Face the music)
Face the music
Race

Well, the joint was rocking

Going round 'n' round
Yeah, reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well, they never stopped rocking
'Til the moon went down

Well it sounded so sweet
I had to take me a chance
I rose out of my seat
And had to dance
I started moving my feet
And clapping my hands

Yeah, we kept on rocking

Going round 'n' round
Yeah, reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well, they never stopped rocking
'Til the moon went down
About twelve o'clock
When the place was packed
The front doors were locked
I said the place was packed
When the police knocked
Those doors flew back

But kept on rocking

Going round 'n' round
Yeah, reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well, they never stopped rocking
'Til the moon went down

Yeah

About twelve o'clock
Around lock up time
Well, the doors were locked
Said the place was packed
When the police knocked
Those doors flew back

But it kept on rocking
Going round 'n' round
Yeah, reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well, they never stopped rocking
'Til the moon went down

Yeah, it kept on rocking

Going round 'n' round
Yeah, reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well, they never stopped rocking
'Til the moon went down

I ain't trying to spend no cash if you ain't spending that ass, no
(I been doing these thing for you, now what you gon' do for me?)
I ain't going down on you if you ain't going down on me, no

You could be my silver spring
Blue green colors flashing

I would be your only dream
Your shining autumn
Ocean crashing

And did you say she was pretty?
And did you say that she loves you?
Baby I don’t want to know

I’ll begin not to love you
Turn around
See me running

I said I loved you years ago
I tell myself
You never loved me, no

And did you say she was pretty?
And did you say that she loves you?
Baby I don’t want to know
Oh, no

And can you tell me was it worth it?
Really I don’t want to know

Time casts its spell on you
But you won’t forget me

I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

Time casts its spell on you
But you won’t forget me

I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

I’ll follow you down
’Til the sound of my voice
Will haunt you

You’ll never get away
From the sound
Of the woman that loves you

I’ll follow you down
’Till the sound of my voice
Will haunt you
You’ll never get away
From the sound
Of the woman that loves you

I’ll follow you down
’Till the sound of my voice
Will haunt you

You’ll never get away
From the sound
Of the woman that loves you

You could be my silver spring
Blue green colors flashing
I see trees that are green, red roses too
I watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more, than I'll ever know
And I think to myself, ohh what a wonderful world

The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of the people passing by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, saying, "How do you do?"
But they're really saying, "I love you"

I see trees that are green and red roses too
I watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself, oh what a wonderful world

The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of the people passing by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?"
But they're really saying, "I love you"
I see trees of green and red roses too
I watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself, oh what a wonderful world

I think to myself, ooh what a wonderful world
I've been in this town so long that back in the city
I've been taken for lost and gone
And unknown for a long, long time

Fell in love years ago with an innocent girl
From the Spanish and Indian home
Of the heroes and villains

Once at night Catillian squared the fight
And she was right in the rain of the bullets
That eventually brought her down

But she's still dancing in the night
Unafraid of what a dude'll do
In a town full of heroes and villains

Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done

Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
Stand or fall I know there shall be peace in the valley
And it's all an affair
Of my life with the heroes and villains

In the Catina
Margareta keeps the spirit high
There I watched her
She spun around and whilst (ha-ha-ha)
She kept the warmth in her body and the flame of the dance

Dance Margareta
Don't you know that I'm in love with you

You're under arrest!

My children were raised
You know they suddenly rise
They started slow long ago
Head to toe, healthy, wealthy, and wise

I've been in this town so long
So long to the city
I'm fit with the stuff
To ride in the rough
And sunny down snuff I'm all right
By the heroes and
Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done

Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
HIM: Ooo heartburn, cold chills
Dizzy spells, I bite my fingernails
I don't think I'm gonna pull through
Everything depends on you
Only your love can save this poor heart of mine
Situation: desperate; honey, save this poor heart of mine

HER: Oh dark days, empty nights
Without your arms to hold me tight
I don't know how long I'm gonna last
So come back baby, I'm sinking fast
Only your love can save this poor heart of mine
Situation: desperate; baby, save this poor heart of mine

HER: Baby, you left me in a burning condition
HIM: And my love, to you, has become my affliction
BOTH: Ooo you know my need for you
Is oh so strong it's like fire set up in my bones
Only your love can save this poor heart of mine
Situation: desperate; baby, save this poor heart of mine
HER: Oh I don't think I'm gonna pull through
HIM: Everything depends on you

BOTH: Only your love can save this poor heart of mine
Situation: desperate; honey, save this poor heart of mine
Sometimes, it seems it's harder to live than to regret
But there's nowhere to run girl
But there's nowhere to run
I've found you only live once, so don't look back
'Cause there's nowhere to run, girl
'Cause there's nowhere to run

Hey, we can escape into the masses
Slip out of our shells
'Cause there's no one to impress
So grab onto my hand
Nothing can stop us
Live like there's no tomorrow
Like there's no tomorrow

Sometimes, it's harder to face myself than face the world
But there's nowhere to run girl
But there's nowhere to run
I've found we are who we are, so love your self
'Cause there's nowhere to run, girl
'Cause there's nowhere to run
Hey, we can escape into the masses
Slip out of our shells
'Cause there's no one to impress
So grab onto my hand
Nothing can stop us
Live like there's no tomorrow
Like there's no tomorrow

Lips are talking, eyes are watching now until the end
Wouldn't it be nice to let 'em miss us
Our eyes are locking, lips are sloppily luring us to sins
I'll take my chances now and beg forgiveness

Hey, we can escape into the masses
Slip out of our shells
'Cause there's no one to impress
So grab onto my hand
Nothing can stop us
Live like there's no tomorrow
Like there's no tomorrow
(And that's the way that you want it)
This how you want it
It's like that
It's all good I'll be right back
That's how you see it
That's what it is
This how you feel
Guess it is what it is
After careful consideration I've concluded tribulations
Make you great if you're willing to go through it
They can hate all they want
But in the end whatever god intends to be will be so
Put your trust in He and not the hearts of men
We often question adversity's purpose stressin'
Not recognizin' the blessin' often missin' the message
Who'da thought I'd emerge from the ruins and the wreckage
Even better than I was before the automatic weapons
The lesson I took away made my testimony compellin'
Enough to leave an impression on strugglin' adolescents
Who nobody invested put forth the effort or took a second
To push it to do their best and promote forward progression
Statistically destined to be arrested
Shot in a second
That hopelessness leads to depression
They disguise as aggression
Tell the federal felon pressin' to earn his way into heaven
Show up or show 'em confessions and opportunities present
Potential is mental your destiny is in your possession
Ambition and education is first and talent is second
You get what you can envision if puttin' me in prison
More important than keepin' them out I respect your decision
After the back and forth and you constantly asking for more
Child support I ask what for and you take me back to court, now
I'm in a public tug-o-war for dough I struggle for
I owe money for my sons, Tiny, and nothin' more
Do much more than average for my sons that's just ignoring facts
You can get off ya ass and work you don't wanna be
F-ckin' poor, that's not quite the issue is it?
It's that we don't fuck no more
That's 'sposed to be you who buyin' houses pickin' out the decor
That's 'sposed to be you in benz's, bentley's, fendi and dior that's
Your problem just accept it you and I are never more
And forever we never will just try your best to deal
I rolled around with you for years and I regret it still
And well since you ain't let yourself know
You look a mess just let yourself go I guess
They say misery love guests, but frankly I'm too blessed
To walk around frowning looking all depressed
Where your self respect to get yourself in check
You disgrace women who work need to put yourself in check
I kept it to myself just cause I felt it wasn't fair
But now I'm pissed to the point I don't care, so there!
Chorus
Green fields where we used to wander
Purple valleys, near my home
We would play there, beneath the sky
And then I kissed you, butterfly

Young girl, you came restless
And you left me here to cry
My big teardrops, in red pastures
For I loved you, butterfly

Butterfly, yeah
I dream about you, lonely without you, butterfly
Butterfly, yeah
Each night I'm sleeping, your face goes creeping, butterfly

Green fields where we used to wander
Purple valleys, near my home
We would play there beneath the sky
And I kissed you, butterfly

Butterfly, yeah
I dream bout you, lonely without you, butterfly
Butterfly, yeah
Each night I'm sleeping, your face goes creeping, butterfly

[Intro]
Ooh ooh, mmm, mmm
Yeah, hey, oh no
Na, na, na, na, na, na, yeah
Ah ah, yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Just to feel your body
Your sensual design
You know my heart goes crazy
When your tender lips touch mine
Let's explore our love
Under candlelight and wine
We'll leave the world behind, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
(Girl, do you believe)
In the miracle of love
(Won't you try and see)
I'm the one you're dreaming of
(Baby, close your eyes)
Let the fantasy become real
Oh, yeah (Will I)

[Chorus]
Stay 'til the morning, baby, rock me, girl
Like I wanna rock you (Like I wanna rock you)

Stay 'til the morning, baby, let me know
That you want me too

[Verse 2]
Can you feel me, baby?
'Cause I'm coming from the heart
You're such a sexy lady, ooh
Just tell me where to start
I'll make sweet, sweet love
Like you never felt before
And give you so much more, hey, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
(When you need a friend)
I will come to you
(You just tell me when)
Girl, that's all you got to do
(Let me be your man)
I will be your pleasure
(Anytime) Anytime, anytime you need

[Chorus]
Stay 'til the morning, baby, rock me, girl
Like I wanna rock you
(Ooh, don't you wanna stay with me, girl)
(Do you wanna stay)
Stay 'til the morning, baby (Yeah), let me know
That you want me too
(Ooh, girl, I want you to stay with me, yeah)
Stay 'til the morning, baby, rock me, girl
Like I wanna rock you
(In the morning, in the evening, and all night long)
Stay 'til the morning, baby (Oh), let me know
That you want me too (I want you)
(I wanna rock you, baby)
(Don't you want me too?)

[Bridge]
I'll sing it from the highest mountain (The highest mountain)
Paint the words across the sky (All across the sky)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I can't live without you (You know I can't)
I can love you through the day and all night, and all night, and all night
Of all the riches in the world, you will forever be my girl
(I wanna know)

[Chorus]
Stay 'til the morning, baby (Baby), rock me, girl
Like I wanna rock you
(I, I wanna rock you, baby, I wanna know)
Stay 'til the morning, baby
(I wanna know if you wanna stay with me tonight), let me know
That you want me too
(Girl, rock me, rock me, rock me, and rock me)
(You better rock me, baby) (All night long)
Stay 'til the morning, baby, rock me, girl
(I'd rather, I'd rather, rather make sweet love to you)
Like I wanna rock you (I'm begging you, baby)
(Yeah, baby)
(Help me, y'all)
Stay 'til the morning, baby (Oh), let me know (Ooh)
That you want me too
(That you want it too, Temptations sing)

[Outro]
Stay (I want you to stay, oh, oh)
With me, ooh, ooh (I wanna be your lover, baby)
Stay (I wanna know would you stay)
With me, ooh, ooh
(I'll do just about anything you'll want me to do, yeah)
Stay (Oh, oh, oh)
(Stay with me)
(Oh, oh)
With me, ooh, ooh (Baby, forever)
(Baby, forever)
(Oh, oh, why don't you stay)
Stay (I love, I love everything about you)
With me, ooh, ooh
Oh what did I say?
She's all shook up
Lost in the summer, man
We're burning up
The time don't show
When the sun gets carried
The tide curves off your body
Oh you'll stay with me

I, now I will show you
It's how I lie
When no one told you

Oh what did I say?
She's all shook up
Vision by the seaside
We move
But I don't know
When the fire gets hazy
The flames roll down and off her body
Oh you'll stay with me
I, now I will show you
It's how I lie
When no one told you

So ride, Sherry, ride, Sherry, ride
I will show you
We'll go in the night
Wondering why no one told you

Now I can walk the stones of the shoreline
And taste the ocean salt when the cold shines
My words are rolling soft down your south side

I, now I will show you
It's how I lie
When no one told you

So ride, Sherry, ride, Sherry, ride
I will show you
We'll go in the night
Wondering why no one told you

Why, you know it goes, you know it goes
Why, you know it goes, you know it goes
Why it goes
Woke up this morning I was all alone
Saw your picture by the telephone
I was missing you oh so bad
Wish I had you here to hold
All I've got is this touch-tone phone
So I guess I'll give you a call

Operator help me please
Get thru to my baby way overseas
Time's wastin' oh so fast
Hello baby tell me is that you
I don't know what we're gonna do
But for now I'm glad I got you on the line

Well it feels so fine
Knowing you're all right
But you're miles away
Lord it's not the same

Well I woke up this morning I was all alone
Saw your picture by the telephone
I've been missing you baby oh so bad
I love you baby with all my might
Come on home and squeeze me tight
Long distance lovin's
Gonna drive me out of my mind

[Verse 1]
The sky was clear that night
We were alone and so much in love
A tree stood at the bottom
Of that lonely field and it was lovely
The moon like a big red bun
Stood in the sky and I wondered why

[Verse 2]
We sat upon the grass
It was so cold, but the heat of my mind
Was enough to keep us warm
And you caressed my body
Oh that was lovely, I'll never forget that night
Oh, my darling, my darling

[Verse 1]
Hey, honey
Cat got ya tongue?
Don't look so funny
Mr. Comedian, joke's on you and
You good at bets, so where's my money?
I know you bet I'd never make that move
So, why's the house empty?
Lights off by the end of this week
I leave wit' what I came wit', baby
I'll take the dogs, you keep the Mercedes

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I'm gone, I'm not fazed
I walk these roads with grace
And I'll wave with you behind me
With a new smile on my face, 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm walkin' in new shoes now
I got a new song to sing
When I walk in the room, every head turns
Every eye is on me
Too bad you're not here to see it
And by the time you get this
I'll be so long, gone and far
I'll send you a postcard
I'll send you a postcard

[Verse 2]
Hey, baby
You seen a ghost?
This ain't yo' lady
This is the chick that you held back
Now, all of the things you said were crazy
I checked off my list and I feel good about it
I got the new haircut
The one that you said wouldn't look no good
Took that job you said I could not get
Wore that dress you said I'd never fit

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you're gone, and I'm great
I got rid of your dead weight
And I'll wave at you behind me
With a new smile on my face, 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm walkin' in new shoes now
I got a new song to sing
When I walk in the room, every head turns
Every eye is on me
Too bad you're not here to see it
And by the time you get this
I'll be so long, gone and far
I'll send you a postcard
I'll send you a postcard
Here we are in a room full of strangers
And an open door
Here we are away from all dangers
But that open door is calling out again

Acting like a friend who wants to know
If you might come away
I wonder what you'll say
You wonder out again

On wings of the night
Once again you'll take flight
And I don't hear your voice anymore
Tonight's dream will end
But I'll stay long after then
And you can have me anytime

Here we are
Alone in the shadows of our lonely rooms
Here we are
We are hollows, very lonely rooms
Like a faithless child
Frightened of the wild he runs and hides
To keep from being still
We run around until we lose ourselves again

On wings of the night
Once again you'll take flight
And I don't hear your voice anymore
Tonight's dream will end
But I'll stay long after then
And you can have me anytime

Tonight's dream will end
But I'll stay long after then
And you can have me anytime
Well the first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry any more
'Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door

Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Whoa oh, what I want to know
Is: are you kind?

It's a buck dancer's choice my friends
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice

Will you come with me?
Won't you come with me?
Whoa oh, what I want to know:
Will you come with me?

God damn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like?
Their walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is "don't tread on me"
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone
He's come to take his children home

It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he knows
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go

Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Whoa oh, what I want to know:
Where does the time go?

I live in a silver mine
And I call it Beggar's Tomb
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune

Anybody's choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa oh, what I want to know:
How does the song go?

Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

Whoa oh, what I want to know:
How does the song go?

Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide

Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come along or go alone
He's come to take his children home
Now take me down to the river
Baby, take me down to the river
You can take me down to the river
Where the waters flow, oh yeah
Down to the river
Can you take me down to the river
Baby, take me down to the river
Where the waters flow
Yeah, well, I know
Yeah, I know
Well, I know
I know I wanna go
Now, down to the river
You can take me down to the river
You can take me down to the river
Where the waters flow
Flow, down, down, down
Oh yeah, taking me, taking me down to the river
Oh, down, down, down, down, down, yeah
Down to the river
Where the waters flow
Down, take me down
Take me now
Down, down, down, down
Taking me down to the river
Down to the river
Will you take me down to the river
Where the waters flow
Take me down, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, well, I know
Ah, well, I know
Well, I know,I know I wanna go
Yeah, take me down to the river
You can take me down to the river
Can you take me down to the river
Where the waters flow
I don't believe you wanted to leave me
You cried to much when you went away

I now deep down inside that you still love me
But you listened to those lying tongues and things they had to say
Of course they said I was to blame
True or not you felt ashamed
And they called you a fool each time you listend to my alibi
But I don't believe you wanted to leave me
You cried to much when we said goodbye

There's gotta be a way to win
Your love back once again
'Cause it just ain't right to let a love like we had fade and die
And I don't believe you wanted to leave me
You cried to much when we said goodbye

[Chorus]
I know, I make mistakes
I am what I am
I'm only a man
So don't take my joy away
Don't turn your back on me

[Verse 1: Shawn]
I know this was my fault but
How much should it cost
To make things right
Do I have to pay for life
We all fall short sometimes
And I'm guilty of that crime
But I just wanna make you see
That you can still believe in me

[Chorus]
I know, I make mistakes
I am what I am
I'm only a man
So don't take my joy away
Don't turn your back on me

[Verse 2: Wanya]
Speak to me, let me know how you feel
If you feel like you can hold on and be strong
I will never leave you lonely
I cry sometimes 'cause I make you cry
And that ain't right
I won't make the same mistake twice
Baby please forgive me

[Chorus]
I know, I make mistakes
I am what I am
I'm only a man
So don't take my joy away
Don't turn your back on me

[Bridge: Nathan]
No I can't erase the wrong I've done
But I hope you can give me another chance
'Cause if you were me you would want the same
And I'd give that chance to you

[Chorus]
I know, I make mistakes
I am what I am
I'm only a man
So don't take my joy away
Don't turn your back on me

[Outro]
I know, I make mistakes
I am what I am
I'm only a man
So don't take my joy away
Don't turn your back on me
I know, I make mistakes
I am what I am
I'm only a man
So don't take my joy away
Don't turn your back on me

[Intro]
A one, a two, a one, two, three ...

Do you have another J?
Is that on tape?
(Laughter)

[Chorus]
Now we're makin' love
Now we're makin' love
We're makin' love
Where'd you get such sweet sugar?

[Verse 1]
I'll be lovin' you day and night
In and out, wrong or right
'Cause I want you, baby
For my wife
Oh girl, you're so divine
You're everything I've ever wanted
You're everything that's on my mind
Is it real?

[Chorus]
That we're makin' love (We're makin' love)
That we're makin' love (We're makin' love)
That we're makin' love (We're makin' love)
Oh my my my my my (We're makin' love)

[Bridge]
Keep right on kissing me
Where I'm kissing you
I know you know
What this is leading to
You know real soon, baby

[Verse 2]
I'll be stroking you in and out
Up and down, all around
I love to hear you make those sounds
I'm gonna be lovin' you in and out
Up and down, all around
'Cause I love to hear you
Make those sounds

I'ma be stroking you in and out
Up and down, all around

And all around the world) Ah, baby

Make those sounds

[Outro]
Oh angel, ooh girl

In luxury, baby
Oh, angel
Ah, ah, ow
Live with me
Honey, you're so fine
Uh I say one life to live
So nigga Im a ball till I fucking fall
Like September gone hell a hall
Niggers act like they dont remember when I was selling raw
But since they run their mouth like bitches they can tell them broads
How I came through
Panama fling blue
Everybody bust down
And Im with the same crew
Half my homies selling dope
They dont got the same view
But we got the same goals
I used to work that same old
I used to sell them same
Tryna touch a hundred mill
Twenty four with a ghost
I swear my life is hell a real
Took them babies out the hood
Put my momma up on that hill
Got the weight up off my shoulders
Tell them that its time to kill
All the sudden all these older suckers mad
Cause only 24 and buying shit they wished they had
Is it my bad?
Or Is it my fault?
Life I live and shit I talk
Hoes I hit and the whips I park
When I did that bit they forget that part
And its all so cold
Where grown men cry
And old men die
But I ain't fold
Did them my time
None of them hope he die
But Im gonna live
Like MIA
Sunday we lie
We in that viv
And when we dib
We fly G5 nigga
I used to have a million and a bad bitch
But now I got it I treat it just like my last bitch
Got another one
Hotter than a double sun
Real homies love me cause they feel just where Im coming from
Old heads been balling
I ain't talking running gun
Use to chase the paper now the money I be running from
Ah every day I wake up I just pray to god
That I get my cake up and I stay alive
Pac Man Pac Man
Run because the ghost is out
Ross has bought a new crib
Shit it looked like Oprahs house
I just bought a new crib
My shit looks like his older house
Last of a dying bread its nothing that I told about
Yall get exported when them bricks get imported
Niggas ain't important they informants be informing
Got a crib in Malibu California
About to do Miami
Got a sting I clear my debt
I told them do it for ah
I ride for my niggers dog
I ride for my niggers uh
And I slide for my niggers dog uh
I say money in the building everybody spending
Thirty racks on me shit my pockets say I'm winning
Louboutin sneakers different colors Ill be in them
Keep a bad chick with me
I don't own her she a rental
Cause I
Wear em out
Take em back
She know I ain't stingy wit it let her make a stack
Lurking at the dealer fuck around and take this back
I get so comfy in that bitch I fuck around and I take a nap Zs
She ask me where that paper I'm like bitch please
Shout out to the jeweler make my wrist freeze
This shit that's on my hip will leave you Swiss cheese
Hit you with the whole clip
You get on some bullshit
I'm a blow this paper like its 2012
If getting money was a sin I guess I'm going to hell
If stunting on them was a crime I guess I'm going to jail
And they gonna have to give me life cause I be doing it well
I'm getting money on the regular
We don't smoke regular cause nigga we ain't regular
Got so many pretty hoes number in my cellular
All I get is straight cash shit I'm like a register
I'm balling like there's no tomorrow
Forty on my Audemar
Thirty for this Prezy piece
I think I got every sneak
I done hit so many dimes
Presidentuary sweet
Back and forth to Hollywood
MIA like every week
Can't remember my maps
Cause I got so many but now I'm back
I came from Hollywood to the trap
And I'm right back in these streets
Ridin' round with this Mac
And I ain't talking about my laptop
Talking bout the back block
Riding in a dirty whip
Hammers in the stash box
Huh? What you know about that?
I'm spitting bars off the top and they ain't flowing like that
They ain't flowing like this
Old school flow
Flowing like kiss raspy voice in the VIP
With a hundred bottle
Ace of spade doing my thing
Hot 97 they know that I'm going angry
My neck, my wrist be all bling
A lot of niggers catch cases
They ain't like me, they'll sing
When its time to see their cell
I ain't had no bail
But had a couple   bitches
They was writing me sending mail
So I had to hold it down
And now I got the crown
I ride for my niggers dog
I ride for my niggers uh
Looking like a rag doll
Mama's little girl
Singing like a skylark
Mama's little girl
Better give me some time for this heart of mine
Cause I just can't take it all in
Still I will remember
Mama's little girl

Ohhhh mama's little girl, little girl
Mama's little girl, little girl

Looking like a rosebud
Mama's little girl
Pickin' up a mountain
Mama's little girl
Better give me some time for this heart of mine
Cause I just can't take it all in
Still we will remember
Mama's little girl
Ohhhh mama's little girl, little girl
Mama's little girl

Looking like a rag doll
Singing like a skylark
Growing like a rosebud
Pickin' up a mountain
Mama's little girl
Mama's little girl

Better give me some time for this heart of mine
Cause I just can't take it all in
Still I will remember
Mama's little girl
Still we will remember
Mama's little girl
Still we will remember
Mama's little girl

Ohhhh mama's little girl, little girl
Mama's little girl, little girl
Mama's little girl
My pockets are empty, I feel so low
If somebody loves me, ain't said so
And I got holes in both of my shoes
Don't look now but I've got the blues

There ain't nobody on this old earth
Who'll give a nickel for what I'm worth
I got more worries that I can use
Don't look now but I've got the blues

Troubles everywhere, I act like I don't care
But it's not true
'Cos I remember things, so many many things
But mostly, I remember you

I'm gonna go some place else
And cry these tears all by myself
I ain't got nothing left to lose
Don't look now but I've got the blues

[Verse 1]
O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world, in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth

[Chorus]
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morning
Fall on your knees
O hear, hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born

[Verse 2]
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle to stand
(O Holy night) O Holy night (O Holy night)
Led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here came the wise men from Orient land

[Chorus]
Oh, a thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morning
Fall on your knees
O hear, the angels' voices
Hear them sing, hear them sing
O night, o night, oh, oh

[Outro]
This holy night God gave His Son
So we might have life (This Holy, this Holy night, ooh, ooh)
This holy night God gave His love
God His love (On this Holy night)
And the angels up above said don't be afraid
(This Holy, this Holy night)
For born to you this night is a Savior, so don't be afraid
So fall down, fall down, fall down on your knees
(Fall on your knees, down on your knees)
Can you hear the angels singing Hallelujah, Hallelujah
(O hear, hear the angels' voices)
O night divine
O night (O night) when Christ was born
(When Christ was born)
Oh night, night divine (O night divine)
O night when Christ was born, born
O holy night (Ooh)

[Verse 1]
You're not the man who gave me everything
I've ever wanted
You're not the man
Who stepped inside my life
And haunted every, every day
You're not the man
Who said he'd never leave
Couldn't breathe
And could not sleep without me
That was someone who you left behind
A long time ago

[Chorus]
You're not the man
Who would bleed for me
Never shed a tear
You're not the one
Who said he'd always be near

[Verse 2]
You're not the man
Who threw me a lifeline
And you're not the man
I am so proud to call mine
And you're not the one
Who said he'd never leave
The one who made me believe in me
That was someone who could do no wrong
And you lost him

[Chorus]
You're not the man
Who would bleed for me
But never shed a tear
You're not the one
Who said he'd always, always, always be here

[Outro]
Said he'd always, always be near
But don't get me wrong
Although it seems sad
It's not all bad
You see
I'm not the little girl I used to be

You're not the man
You're not the one
Who said he'd always, always, always be near
He was everything you see
He made me believe in me
Said he'd always, always, always be here
Spin that wheel
Just let go
Where she falls
Nobody knows
Save your breath
Let those snake eye roll

We bounce between the devil and the deep blue sea
We bounce between forever and what may never be
Let the light of love keep bouncing off the diamond in the darker side of me

I never had no education
Just an articulation of the heart
But burning deep inside me there is a diamond in the dark

Catch that flame
Let it warm your soul
Love's cruel game
Is the great unknown
All that fear
Do you know you're not alone
We bounce between the devil and the deep blue sea
We bounce between forever and what may never be
We bounce between decisions, destinations constantly
Let the light of love keep bouncing off the diamond in the darker side of me

I never had no education
Just on inarticulation of the heart
But burning deep inside me there is a diamond in the dark

A shine, a flash and then it's over
A lightning strike, a chance remark
Am I the only one here like a diamond in the dark
Like a diamond in the dark
Calling out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat?
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancing in the street
They're dancing in Chicago
Down in New Orleans
In New York City

All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be swinging and swaying and records playing
Dancing in the street
Oh, it doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, ev'ry guy, grab a girl
Ev'rywhere around the world
They'll be dancing. (Dancing in the street.)
They're dancing in the street. (Dancing in the street.)

It's an invitation across the nation
A chance for folks to meet
There'll be laughing, singing, and music swinging
Dancing in the street
Philadelphia, P.A
Baltimore and D.C. now
Can't forget the Motor City
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be swinging and swaying and records playing
Dancing in the street
Oh, it doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, ev'ry guy, grab a girl
Ev'rywhere around the world
They'll be dancing. (Dancing in the street.)
They're dancing in the street. (Dancing in the street.)

Way down in L.A. ev'ry day
They're dancing in the street
(Dancing in the street.)
Let's form a big, strong line, get in time
We're dancing in the street
(Dancing in the street.)
Across the ocean blue, me and you
We're dancing in the street
(Dancing in the street.)
Listen now boys
My grandmother said -
I'll tell you a story and
Then off to bed
There once was a time
We lived off the land
Harvest would come
And we all lent a hand

But winds blew our lives
And scattered our seeds
Changing the landscape
From flowers to weeds
See in the graveyard
The families gone
The grandest of tombstones
Carry them on...

When you sail from the Harbour
It's your last eyes of Ireland
We tended the fire
And faeries appeased
The flame never died
Until we had to leave
And when we were gone
The house tumbled down
And covered our footprints
We'd left on the ground

When you sail from the Harbour
It's your last eyes of Ireland

My eyes are now tired
And no longer see
But visions of Ireland
Linger in me

So carry your past
In the rooms of your heart
And you'll never he empty
Of love when you part

When you sail from the Harbour
It's your last eyes of Ireland
Ooh

He looked a lot like Che Guevara, drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion, such a humble man
The only survivor of the National People's Gang
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions, they followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

Putting on some clothes, I made my way to school
I found my teacher crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights
Having scored a trillion dollars, made a run back home
Found him slumped across the table, a gun and me alone
I ran to the window, looked for a plane or two
Panic in Detroit, he'd left me an autograph
"Let me collect dust," I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Panic in Detroit
Panic in Detroit

Ow
Hey, little girl, baby, what's wrong with you?
I've done everything I knew to do
I've tried so hard, I tried, sorry, just can't please you

Hey, little girl, I've given you all that you need
And I've been a good man, a good man indeed
I've tried so hard, you misuse me
But I tried, sorry, just can't please you

I brought you happiness when you were mad
I even made you smile when you are sad
Leaving you, baby, may make you mad
But you will soon realize what a good man you have

Hey, little girl, honey, what's wrong with you?
I say I've done everything for you, baby, I know to do
I've tried so hard, you misuse me, sorry, just can't please you

Hey, I brought you happiness when you were sad
I even made you smile, baby, when you were mad
Leaving you, baby, may make you mad
But you'll soon find out what a good man you have
Little girl, baby what's wrong with you?
Hey, I've done everything for you, everything I knew to do
I've tried so hard, you misuse me
But I tried, sorry, just can't please you

Gave you everything mink coats
Even bought you a brand new home
Everything a full man can do for you
You know I've done it, baby

Can you hear me?
Worked hard everyday
Still can't feed you, baby

[Verse 1: Sleepy Brown]
Cadillacs are coming, from everywhere (Yeah)
Liquor vibing good ‘cause love is in the air
To all you players and you pimps, smoke out and have a ball
And if your hoe is actin crazy, put her on the wall
Now now now everybody's dancing and just feeling right
I see all of you players got your sauce laid in more ice
I hope when all of this is over, as I get old, yeah
My kids'll have a story, that still be told, woo, huh, about

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
All the players came, from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell ya, there's a better day
When the player’s ball is happening all day e'ryday

[Verse 2: André 3000]
It's beginning to look a lot like, what? Follow my every step
Take notes on how I crept, I's bout to go in depth
This is the way I creep my season, here's my ghetto rep
I kept, to say the least no, no it can't cease
So I begin to piece my two and two together
Gots no snowy weather, have to find something to do better bet
I said subtract, so shut up that, nonsense about some silent night
I gots it crunk, if it ain't real, ain't right
I'm like no matter what the season
Forever chill with Smith
I sip my fifth, I chill with Wesson, got my reasons
So tell me what did you expect
You thought I'd break my neck, to help y'all deck the halls
Oh naw, I got other means of celebrating
I'm getting blizzard at HoJo, I got that hoochie waiting
I made it through another year can't ask for nothing much more
It's OutKast for the books, I thought you knew so now you know
Let's go

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
All the players came, from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell ya, there's a better day
When the player’s ball is happening all day e'ryday

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Halle-lu-jah, halle-lu-jah
Y'know I do some things more different than I used to
'Cause I'm a player, doing what the players do
The package store was closed, okay my day is ruined
This is ridiculous, I'm getting serious, I'm getting curious
'Cause the house is smelling stank, the chitlins old as bitches
I made no wishes ‘cause I'm mobbing folk niggas in the back
Getting tipsy off the nog and high as hell off the contact smoke
They having a smoke out in my back seat
They passing herb rewinding verses 'cause it's in the air
I hit the parks, I hit the cuts, I'm hitting switches
'Cause I'm switching from side to side looking for hoes and snitches
I'm wide open on the freeway, my pager broke my vibe
'Cause a junkie is a junkie three-sixty-five
It's just another day of work to me the spirit just ain't in me
Grab my pistol and my ounce see what them junkies gotta give me
'Cause it's like that, yeah
Forever pimpin', never slippin', that's how it is

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
All the players came, from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell ya, there's a better day
When the player’s ball is happening all day e'ryday

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Ain't no chimneys in the ghetto so I won't be hanging my socks on no chimney
I'm fit as a tick, fix me a plate, I got the remedy
Some greens and that ham, not
Don't need no ham hocks, don't play me like I'm smoking rocks
I got the munchies, we got the Mary Jane in the Dungeon
Just to let you niggas know in '93, that's how we coming
So ho ho hoes, check my king-ass 'fro
The gin and juice has got me tipsy so, um…

[Verse 5: André 3000]
It goes, give me ten, and I'll serve you then, now we bend
The corner in my Cadillac
My heart does not go pitty-pat for no rat
I'm leaning back, my elbow's out the window
Coke, rum and indo fills my body, where's the party?
We roll deep, we dip to Underground, see a lot of hoes around
I spit my game awaiting countdown
A five, fo', a three, two, here comes the one
A new year has begun, P-Funk, spark another one…

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
All the players came, from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell ya, there's a better day
When the player’s ball is happening all day e'ryday

[Interlude: Peaches]
Here's a little something for the players out there hustling
Getting down for theirs
From East Point, College Park, Decatur, Da 'Briar
You know, niggas worldwide
Down, for theirs

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening all day e'ryday
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening all day e'ryday
Been too long

I miss you darling
I miss you so hard

I miss you darling
I miss you so hard

Miss you so hard
Now
(Miss you darling)
Come back baby
And don't break my heart
How it goes

And now I'm alone lying down
Looking up at the stars
(Stars)
Relivin' the
Relivin' the times we shared when the moon the stars and the music was all
Been way too long
Been way too long baby
Way too long
Been way too long baby
Way too long
I can't wait too long baby
Way too long
I can't wait too long baby
Way too long
I can't wait too long baby
Way too long
I can't wait too long baby
Way too long
I can't wait too long baby
Way too long
I can't wait too long baby

Baby you know that I
Can't wait forever
Awoke in the night again
We were together
Windows of darkness are
All I can see through
Searching the shadows
Hoping to see you
Baby you know that I
Can't wait forever
Awoke in the night again
We were together
Baby you know that I...

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
So scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them bleed
So let me be, and I'll set you free (Oh yeah)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me, oh

[Post Chorus: Background]
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be completely intertwined
Not that I didn't care, it's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel, it's what I didn't show
So let me be, and I'll set you free

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me (Oh yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Background]
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
You say your faith is shaken, and you may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused, so far away from you
I'm getting there, I don't care where I have to roam
Why do you do what you do to me?
Why won't you answer me, answer me?
Why do you do what you do to me?
Why won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me (Oh yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back, yeah

[Outro: Adam Levine]
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back, yeah
Yeah yeah, oh, no, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, oh
Raven's child
Is chasing salvation
Black beak turned white
From the crack and the snow
On the streets of despair
The answer is simple
A spoonful of mercy
Can set free the soul

The drug king sits
On his arrogant throne
Away and above and apart
Even children
Are twisted to serve him
And greed has corrupted
What once was a heart

Raven's child
Keeps vigil for freedom
Trades for the arms
That once made her strong
With nuclear warheads
And lasers in heaven
Fear does the choosing
Between right and wrong
The arms king sits
On his arrogant throne
Away and above and apart
Bankers assure him
That he needn't care
And greed makes a stone of
What once was a heart

Raven's child
Is washing the water
All of her wing-feathers
Blackened with tar
Prince William shoreline's
An unwanted highway
Of asphalt and anger
An elegant scar

The oil king sits
On his arrogant throne
Away and above and apart
Lawyers have warned him
He mustn't speak
And greed has made silent
What once was a heart

You know there are walls
That come tumbling down
For people who yearn to be free
Still there are hearts
That long to be opened
And eyes that are longing to see
Raven's child is our constant companion
Sticks like a shadow
To all that is done
Try as we may
We just can't escape him
The source of our sorrow and shame
We are one

The true King sits
On a heavenly throne
Never away nor above nor apart
With wisdom and mercy
And constant compassion
He lives in the love
That lives in our hearts

[Spoken]
Uh, thanks. Um... Welcome to my show; it's called:
"If You Sing Along I'll Fucking Kill You."
Uh, this is a song

[Singing]
Every time I go to dinner
It seems like I'm getting a little bit thinner
I'll sit down at the breakfast table
I can talk; they're not able
When I look at them I find
There's a single question on their mind
I wish it could go back to the way it was
It's not easy now because

My whole family thinks I'm gay
I guess it's always been that way
Maybe its cause of the way that I walk
That makes them think I like... boys
That I like boys
The God damn question just won't go away
And, I get asked it every single day
But, the way they ask is not a disguise
Like "How was your day? Do you like to kiss guys?" (That's... funny)
This is the worst; baby, this was my fear
Now, their opinions are crystal-clear because

My whole family now is shocked
I'm in the closet, and the door is locked
Now my glory days are gone
I was John Elway; now I'm Elton John

My whole family now suspects
That watching Spongebob had side-effects
I'm not gay, and that's what I said
If I'm gay, hey God, strike me dead

[Hacking/coughing]

Just cause I'm afraid of the snow
Or my favorite color is the rainbow
I don't mean to yell, but I fear I must
'Cause I'm losing the people that I thought I could trust

Because even my boyfriend thinks I'm gay (Motherfuck--)

You all probably think I'm gay
Man, this song is counterproductive
La la la la la
Because my whole family thinks I'm gay
What do they know anyway?
You gotta look right through the haze
Easy-Bake Oven was just a phase

My whole family thinks I'm queer
That is all I ever hear
But I've been as straight as a ramp
If you don't count Bible camp

[Spoken]
Thanks for comin' out, uh
Hey, so those ASU girls are pretty hot, any of you... any of ya?

[cheering from audience]

Okay, this isn't a great example, but um...
I'm just kidding, you're in the dark, I couldn't see you
I bet you're gorgeous in the dark; um

You like my shirt? (Yeah)
Um, back home they call me the tie-dye shirt kid
Well, that and faggot

All we ever got was cold
Get up, eat jelly

Oh, to be the cream
Oh, to be the cream
There’s a bright golden haze on the meadow
There’s a bright golden haze on the meadow
The corn is as high as an elephants eye
An’ it looks like it’s climbin’ clear up in the sky

Oh, What a beautiful mornin’
Oh, What a beautiful day
I got a beautiful feelin’
Ev’erything’s goin’ my way

All the cattle are standin’ like statues
All the cattle are standin’ like statues
They don’t turn their heads as they see me ride by
But a little brown mav’rick is winkin’her eye

Oh, What a beautiful mornin’
Oh, What a beautiful day
I got a beautiful feelin’
Ev’erything’s goin’ my way

All the sounds of the earth are like music
All the sounds of the earth are like music
The breeze is so busy it don’t miss a tree
And an ol’ weepin’willer is laughin’ at me!
Oh, What a beautiful mornin’
Oh, What a beautiful day
I got a beautiful feelin’
Ev’erything’s goin’ my way

Yes there's something inside of me
And it just won't go away
Yes there's something inside of me
And it just won't go away
Yes it was these blues you gave me
When you left me
Oh when you left me that day

When somebody leaves you
You just lose a friend
But when you left me babe
Thought it was the end

Because there's something inside of me
And it just won't go away
Yes it was these blues you gave me
When you left me
Oh when you left me that day
When somebody leaves you
You just lose a friend
But when you left me babe
Thought it was the end

Because there's something inside of me
And it just won't go away
Yes it was these blues you gave me
When you left me
Oh when you left me that day
This time

[Part I - Encounter]
Listen very carefully, my words are about to unfold
Concerning a lady I've seen but I never could hold
I can see by your smile
Take a long while
The words that come through
I see that they're true
For she reminds me of you

Don't misunderstand me, it's not always easy to say
The words in your head and your heart that you just can't explain
I can see clearly
A face in the sky
Moon's in your eye
You're passing me by
Tell me the reason why

I can see clearly
A face in the sky
Moon's in your eye
You're passing me by

[Part II - Smiles For You]

[Instrumental]

[Part III - Lady Fantasy]
Saw you riding on a moon cloud
Saw you walking on a whirlpool
From the corner of my eye
I saw you

Saw you sitting on a sunbeam
In the middle of my daydream
Oh my Lady Fantasy
I love you
Added to their thirteen colonies Tennessee, Vermont, Kentucky
Louisiana and Ohio and Mississippi and Indiana Alabama Maine Missouri
Added Arakansas and Michigan added Florida and Texas
And in Texas five thousand men under Santa Anna
Had crossed the Rio Grande headed for San Antonio
David Crockett left Tennessee with the volunteers headed for San Antonio
At a Spanish mission near San Antonio they met a knife-fighter
And a gambler named Jim Bowie and a Britisher named Travis
One hundred eighty Americans against five thousand to the death
I don't know why I love you like I do
I don't why, but I do
I don't know why you thrill me like you do
I don't know why, but you do

You never seem to want my romancing
The only time you hold me is when we're dancing

I don't know why I love you like I do
I don't know why, but I do

You never seem to want my romancing
The only time you hold me is when we're dancing

I don't know why I love you like I do
I don't know why, but I do
I always thought that I'd prefer single-blessed-ness
Thought that I'd like to stay free
I never thought my time would come to marry
No wedding bells for me, I've changed my mind after all
You are the one made me fall, for...
I used to smile at all the songs that were popular
Nothing but love in each song
I used to think those kind of songs were foolish
Now I admit I'm wrong
Love songs are part of my plan, show me the minister man, for...

I never knew I could love anybody
Honey, like I'm loving you;
I couldn't realize what a pair of eyes and a baby smile could do
I can't sleep, I can't eat
I never knew a single soul could be so sweet
I never knew I could love anybody
Honey, like I'm loving you

Let me tell 'bout a gal I know
She's my baby and she lives next door
Every morning 'fore the sun comes up
She brings my coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
When I'm in trouble and I got no friend
I know she'll go with me down to the end
Everybody asks me how do I know
I smile a damn and say she told me so
That why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
Now if I call her on the telephone
Tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her on my door
In the evening when the sun goes down
When there ain't nobody hanging 'round
She just kisses me, and then holds me tight
And tells me, baby, everything's gonna be alright
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I just, I love her so
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
Oh!
You're so sexy, yo!

I don’t know, where you’re going
Or when you’re coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don’t know, where you’re going
Just get your ass back home

We both knew this type of life didn’t come with instructions
So I’m trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets downright shitty in fact
When you call and I don’t know what city I’m in at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month

In a year I don’t recall
It’s like my life’s on repeat and the last time we spoke
I told you I wouldn’t be long
That was last November, now December’s almost gone
I’d apologize but I don’t realize what I’m doing wrong
I don’t know, where you’re going
Or when you’re coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don’t know, where you’re going
Just get your ass back home

And you’ve been nothing but amazing
And I never take that for granted
Half of these birds would have flew the coop
But you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me
Every time you heard some bogusness
You deserve a standing o ‘cause they’d a just been over it

Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk
Like we don’t hear what they saying
Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk
We’ll just drive by and keep waving

'Cause you and I above all that
Just let them wallow in it
Now they all choked up, yuck
'Cause they be swallowing it

I don’t know, where you’re going
Or when you’re coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don’t know, where you’re going
Just get your ass back home
No one holds me down like you do sweetheart
You keep doing that, I keep doing this
We’ll be alright in the end
Trust that
We put the us in trust, baby
Let’s go

I don’t care what you’re after
As long as I’m the one, no
I don’t care why you’re leaving
You’ll miss me when you’re gone

I don’t know, where you’re going
Or when you’re coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don’t know, where you’re going
Just get your ass back home

Ha ha
I'm home baby!
I am the searcher of my fortunes
I've got my right hand on the wheel
We've got to dig for buried treasures
I know exactly how I feel
I went walkin'thru a grave - yard
Where the darkness is my friend
I heard all about the beginning
I wanna see just where it ends
I have fed the jaded tiger
And every tiger knows my name
But just as long as long as I can see my face
I can tell myself my name
Don't want to live inside myself
I'm much better of alone
But then you must believe in the fallin'rain
In the morning
Bury me down by the river
Saved by the bell
Man for all seasons
When all the world was very young
And mountain magic heavy hung
The supermen would walk in file
Guardians of a loveless isle
And gloomy browed with superfear
Their endless tragic lives
Could heave nor sigh
In solemn, perverse serenity
Wondrous beings chained to life

Strange games they would play then
No death for the perfect men
Life rolls into one for them
So softly a supergod cries

Where all were minds in uni-thought
Power weird by mystics taught
No pain, no joy, no power too great
Colossal strength to grasp a fate
Where sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers
Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold
A man would tear his brother's flesh
A chance to die
To turn to mold
Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod cries

Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod dies
Oh I used to ask my mother
Would I ever find true love?
She would tell me, true love is hard to find

So I traveled on
Everyone I came upon
I would stop and ask
They would tell me
True love is hard to find
That's what they would say

The years that passed
I'm all alone
No longer do I ask
I just place my faith
In five little words
From way back in my past
My mama said
Seek and you shall find
That's what mama said
Seek and you shall find
Sometimes I get so lonely
It seems useless to groan
But then I remember
Somewhere true love has waited there
But I'll keep on holding on
Keep on keeping on
But I know that I keep trying
I can lose
Seek and you shall find
That's what my mama said
Seek and you shall find
Help me somebody!
Oooh
Oooh
Oh

There is no happy ending
To this story I'm telling you
But I remember somewhere
True love, I know it's waiting there
I'm gonna keep on keeping on
You know that I'm gonna keep holding on
Cause I now if I keep trying
I can't lose, cause there's no denying
Seek and you shall find
I know that's what my mama said
Seek and you shall find
Ohhh
Seek and you shall find
If it's love that you're looking for
Seek and you shall find
It must be right around the corner
Seek
You can't erase the Paper Chase
She'll make you play it
In the bright merry morning
She'll run and hide
And leave you the paper promises
Behind her as she runs across the square

You can't win the race, She'll set the pace
You will hear her laughing
Just behind the foolish fences
Throw back the gate and find the
Piece of paper lying on the curbstone
But the lady won't be there

Later in the day
You'll be searching for a way
To let her know you're ready
For her little game to end
Cause it's getting dark, and then-

You'll see her face, a glimpse of lace
And you'll go running
Through the last sweet dying daydream
Calling her name, but she's been home an hour
Laughing at the mirror
As she combs her paper hair
Where is the sun
That shone
On my head
The sun in my life
It is dead
It is dead
Where is the light
That would play
In my streets
And where are the friends
I could meet
I could meet
Where are the girls
I left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind
Where are the girls
I left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind
Where is the girl
Where is the girl
I loved all along
The girl that I loved
She's gone
She's gone
All of my life
I call yesterday
The spicks and the specks
Of my life've gone away
All of my life
I call yesterday
The spicks and the specks
Of my life've gone away
Everybody
Spicks and specks
Spicks and specks, yeah
Ahh, spicks and specks
There's no business like show business like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing, everything that traffic will allow
Nowhere could you get that happy feeling when you are stealing that extra bow

There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Even with a turkey that you know will fold, you may be stranded out in the cold
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold, let's go on with the show

The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
Are secretly unhappy men because
The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
Get paid for what they do but no applause
They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye for anything theatrical and why?

There's no business like show business and I tell you it's so
Traveling through the country is so thrilling, standing out in front on opening nights
Smiling as you watch the theater filling, and there's your billing out there in lights

There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Angels come from everywhere with lots of jack, and when you lose it, there's no attack
Where could you get money that you don't give back? Let's go on with the show
(There's no business like show business like no business I know)
You get word before the show has started that your favorite uncle died at dawn
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted, you're broken-hearted, but you go on

(There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low)
Yesterday they told you you would not go far, that night you open and there you are
Next day on your dressing room they've hung a star, let's go on with the show!!
Hey hey good lookin' whatcha got cookin'
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me
Hey hey sweet baby don't you think
Maybe we could find us a brand new recipe

I got a hot rod Ford and a two dollar bill
And I know a spot right over the hill
There's soda pop and the dancin's free
If you wanna have fun come along with me

Hey hey good lookin' whatcha got cookin'
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me
I'm free and ready so we can go steady
How's about savin' all your time for me

No more lookin' I know I've been token
How's about keepin' steady company
I'm gonna throw my date book over the fence
Find me one for five or ten cents

Keep it till it's covered with age 'cause
I'm writin' your name down on every page
Say hey good lookin' whatcha got cookin'
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me
By the way the land is layin'
I think I'd be safe in sayin'
That over the next hill we'll be home

It's a straight and narrow highway
No detours and no byways
And over the next hill we'll be home

From the prophets I've been hearin'
I would say the end is nearin'
For I see familiar landmarks all along

By the dreams that I've been dreamin'
There will come a great redeemin'
And over the next hill we'll be home

By the speed that we'd been makin'
I would say there's no mistakin'
That over the next hill we'll be home

There's a place that we are nearin'
That so many have been fearin'
And over the next hill we'll be home
When we get there we're all hopin'
That we'll find the gate is open
And there'll be a refuge from the comin' storm

For the way's been long and weary
But at last the end is nearin'
And over the next hill we'll be home
Everytime my baby and me go up town
Police come and they knock me down
Cocaine, all around my brain

Hey baby, better come here quick
This old cocaine is making me sick
Cocaine, all around my brain

Yonder comes by baby, she's dressed in red
She's got a shot-gun, says she's gonna kill me dead
Cocaine, all around my brain

Hey baby, better come here quick
This old cocaine is making me sick
Cocaine, all around my brain

Early one morning, half past four
Cocaine came knockin' on my door
Cocaine, all around my brain

Hey baby, you better come here quick
This old cocaine is making me sick
Cocaine, all around my brain
Cocaine's for horses and it's not for men
Doctor said it kill you, but he don't say when
Cocaine, all around my brain

Hey baby, you better come here quick
This old cocaine is making me sick
Cocaine, all around my brain

[Verse 1]
So long child, I'm on my way
And after all is done, after all is done
Don't be down, it's all in the past
Though you may be afraid

[Chorus]
So long child, it's awful dark
And I've never felt the sun
I dread to think of when
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
When the wind blows

[Verse 2]
Life burns a savage wound, angry and wrong
Trusting a twisted word, you'll run, run away
You'll take him home
You'll spit and taunt him
But they won't believe you
No matter what you'll say

[Chorus]
So long child, it's awful dark
I never felt the sun
I dread to think of when
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
Steady rock easy
Rock stead easy
Steady rock easy
Rock stead easy
Steady rock easy
When first I heard rock steady
Thrilled me to the bone
When I talk about rocking steady
You need a baby for your own
Rock stead easy
Steady rock easy
Rock stead easy
Steady rock easy
Talk about the cha-cha
Talk about the mambo
When I talk about rocking steady
You better be ready
To rock stead easy

Steady rock easy
Rock stead easy
Steady rock easy
When first I heard rock steady
Thrilled me to the bone
When I talk about rocking steady
You need a baby for your own
Rock stead easy
Steady rock easy
Rock stead easy
Steady rock easy
Rock stead easy
Steady rock easy
You're doing good
Rock stead easy
Just like you should
Steady rock easy
You're looking fine
And I love you so though people ask me how
How I've lived till now, I tell them I don't know
I guess they understand how lonely life has been
But life began again the day you took my hand

And yes I know how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me and the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me

And you love me too your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free, I'm happy that you do
The book of life is brief and once a page is read
All but love is dead that is my believe

And yes I know how loveless life can be
The shadows follow me and the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening bring me down
Now that you're around me

And I love you so though people ask me how
How I've lived till now, I tell them I don't know

[Intro]
Deck
You start by doing that first, okay?
Okay, here we go
Deck, deck
Not you, not you
Deck, deck, deck
Deck, no, deck

[Chorus]
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
'Tis the season to be jolly
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Don we now our gay apparel
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Something something Yuletide carol
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Merry Christmas
Just in time
I found you just in time
Before you came, my time
Was running low

I was lost
The losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed
Nowhere to go

Now you're here
And now I know just where I'm goin'
No more doubt or fear
I've found my way

For love came just in time
You found me just in time
And changed my lonely life
That lovely day

Now you're here
And now I know just where I'm goin'
No more doubt or fear
'Cause I've found my way
For love came just in time
You found me just in time
And changed my lonely life that lovely
Lonely life that lovely
Lonely life that lovely day
Oh Willie, oh Willie, I'm scared of your ways
Oh Willie, oh Willie, I'm scared of your ways
I'm scared you will lead my poor body astray

Pretty Polly, Pretty Polly, you guessed just about right
Well, Polly, Pretty Polly, you guessed just about right
For I dug on your grave the best part of last night

She through her arms around him and she began to cry
She through her arms around him and she began to cry
I can't kill a woman that loves you such as I

There's no time to talk now, there's no time to stand
There's no time to talk now, there's no time to stand
He drew out his dagger all in his right hand

He pierced her in the heart and her lifeblood did run
He pierced her in the heart the lifeblood did flow
Deep in her grave Pretty Polly did go

He threw the dirt around her and then he went home
He threw the dirt around her and then he went home
With nobody there but the wild birds to moan
A debt to the devil Willie must pay
A debt to the devil Willie must pay
For killing Pretty Polly and running away

Oh, where is Pretty Polly? Yonder she stands
Oh, where is Pretty Polly? Yonder she stands
The rings on the fingers of her lilywhite hand
The rings on the fingers of her lilywhite hand

[B.O.B]
Well you know who it is
You ain't even got to ask it
I am not the best I am the next level past it

[x3]

Haters see me passing like damn that bastard (dammit)
Cause they outta style like the water bed mattress
Yeah yeah, they thought I'd fade to the blackness
Now they see me everywhere like Samuel L Jackson (mothafucka)
But I ain't actin=', I'm only givin' classes
And by the looks of these grades niggas ain't passin'
No, it's crazy how these niggas think
They be actin' like I ain't like Howard in the paint
Like trees and Cali man, all I do is blaze
And they say I'm like a zombie
Cause all I want is brains
Mine
Yes, mine mine mine
Yeah you look good girl but what is on your mind?
Think about it
Cause all these dimes
Like Nationwide, they just wanna be on my side
But baby this is all I can provide
The whole town'll have water if I lay this pipe
I'm on top of the world and I'm so high
I gotta drop down just to catch my flight
Yikes
What amazing heights
Gee wilikers Batman, holy satellites
Who the hell are you to tell me ease up on this mic?
You, sadly have mistaken me for someone that I'm nite
I mean not
I messed up
But I rock with this stuff
So my stocks just went up
You know my flow
Yeah it's B dot O
Yeah it's B dot O
Yeah it's B dot O
And you know my flow
Yeah I hear them talkin' with that raspy shit (shhh)
But what's an upper class man to a graduate?
I said {mumbling} and you laugh to it
I'm just playin' with these niggas I ain't mad at 'em
But since you critics want to be that adamant
I guess I give you reason to type on your keypad again
Yeah I buy buzz and got the whole web chatterin'
How ironic? In my past it ain't matter then
Well, it comes with the territory
My life is not an ordinary story
Naw, and I ain't talking big
This is just how I feel about the situation that I'm in
Yeah
No you can never walk in my shoes dawg
Even if I got my dude to make your shoes dawg
You know about that south we act like fools dawg
Your girl says she like that country smooth drawl
That's why there's groupies ready to remove draws
They be going heavy duty til that Goose gone
Every single day I wake up to a new song
That's the sound of my formal introdushon
I mean "tion"
What's up?
You know, my flow
Cause it's B dot O
And it's B dot O
And it's B dot O
And you know, my flow
So to all the people that's about to hate it
Here's how I feel about you {burps}
There, I demonstrated
Ha, a politician so opinionated
So my style is addictive like simple lemonade is
I'm in the building and I'm finna hit the stage
You can feel the tension and the sense of mental stimulation
If she's with me than she's not your lady
And as we can see, she loves my babies
Me go so crazy
Me go so loco lately
Mostly because they raised me
No heat, no cold, no A.C
Yeah I'm just saying how I feel up in this booth
One of y'all surprise me and do something new
I love you, there's nothing to hide
It's better than burning inside
I love you, no use to pretend
There! I've said it again

I've said it, what more can I say
Believe me, there's no other way
I love you, I will to the end
There! I've said it again

I try to drum up
A phrase that will sum up
All that I feel for you
But what good are phrases
The thought that amazes
Is that you love me
And it's heavenly

Forgive me for wanting you so
But one thing I want you to know
I've loved you since heaven knows when
There! I've said it again

[Verse 1]
Some day, when I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight
Yes, you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
And the way you look tonight

[Verse 2]
With each word, your tenderness grows
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh wrinkles your nose
It touches my foolish heart
Ooh, you're lovely, never, ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it?

[Chorus]
'Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight

[Bridge]
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
It touches my foolish heart, oh
You're lovely, never, ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it?

[Chorus]
'Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight, mm, mm
Just the way you look tonight
You gonna do somethin' to
Who (who), What (what), When (when)
Never that
If they got a problem
Tell em call me we can settle that
Matter of fact
You ain't gotta them em
I'll tell em that (I'll tell em)
And if these niggas sigh we gon slide down where they mother at
Ak-47 with the double strap
How your shit stay at the funeral
Bring my rubber back
Chicks are fuckin' with the wrong one
Yea I gotta show
Tell em but I got a long gun
Call the mac the chicken wing cause it got it's own drum
I know these niggas sick of me
'Cause I done had a long run
Countin' all this money
Fuckin' all these hoes
They was lookin' at me funny
When I pulled up in that rose
Ya'll good for talkim' on Twitter (twitter)
We good for sparkin' on niggas (sparkin')
Broad day
Walk up on a niggas head and homicide
You gonna put the chopper on a nigga

[Chorus]
Hey, you gon do somethin to
Who, what, when
You say you want it with
Who, what, when
Them shots come in with
Who, what, when
You were sayin that to
Who, what, then, fuck nigga
You'd better get that fuck shit off your mind
'Cause I'm a up that strap
You crossed the line
Cut these apples out you niggas startin spreadin the new
When I choose shit on a corpse
Hide head with the two

Where you can find me
You can find me
At the top of the list
And if they ever let me in I ain't stoppin for shit
See that motivation make you say I'm cocky as shit
Watever, fuck it tell em suck and help part of my dick
Now a day, play, I coulda possibly get em, get paid
Get out the Maybach and go hop in the jet
Know they hatin on the rise and the chilled I spin
In the Phantom, I'm lookin fly in whatever I'm in
Mostly you big niggas soft like the Michelin man
When you see other niggas standin with a pencil in hand
Carry me on stage rappin with my dick in my hand
Tryna distiguish the difference between a bitch and a fan
Outa bed, rolled one homie, never again
Cause I sold dough once now I sell it again
Fur weed 500, I sell it again
Tell the mice mane win let the elfs keep sayin

[Chorus]
Hide head with the two

I'm ballin half around, half a jet, nigga pound for pound
Only time we showin up, the shut this motha fucker down
Ridin round in the Kia, no spare tires
Chopper round shots fired
Nigga flatlines zip came to it and keep the powder savoral
Drive bys on dirt bike with Meek Milli O
Crow rock shells
I bleach em and watch em fade away
And leave a nigga block
Wetter than a rainy day
West beat Beavis when you scared to leave the crib
Guzzi and he inspired for some of the dolla mill
I'm worth mills and I beat a niggas ass still
Ya'll niggas get wasted I ain't talkin spilled bills
School a hunt knox I'm a hate a cheetah
One ya a dick sucka get your head up with the nina
And YM still strapped snookin with the cleava
Ya best bet: to run the other way when I see ya

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna call in a day
The company's gone and I'm all alone
All by myself, and I'm meeting you, baby, yeah
Inside my mind now I realized shadows will fall
Oh, I wish you would call
Call on me, baby, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I've found my dream
You're the key to my heart, my heart
You're the only one for me
I knew it right from the start, the start

[Chorus]
Girl, you hold the key
The key to my heart, oh, my heart
You hold the key
The key to my heart, oh, my heart

[Verse 2]
There's love in your mind and love in your heart
You show it to me so naturally
And you know we're gonna be forever, baby, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Sharin' our lives and sharin' our love, it's never too late
When you make a mistake
'Cause you know I'm lookin' out for you, baby, yeah

[Chorus]
You know you are my dream
You're the key to my heart, my heart
You're the only one for me
You're the key to my heart, my heart

[Outro]
You hold the key
The key to my heart, my heart
You hold the key
The key to my heart, my heart

[Verse 1: Shawn Stockman & Nathan Morris]
Cry
The tears you shed alone
The reason for your pain
I'll never ask you why
But baby, will you
Try
It's something you can do
I promise that one day, the rain will go away
To the sound of your laughter

[Pre-Chorus: Wanya Morris]
When the weight of the world is on you
Broken up and you're playing the fool
Just remember this is a chapter in the story of me and you
This ain't no fairytale

[Chorus: Boyz II Men & Wanya Morris]
Baby, you're never gonna be alone
(Baby, you'll never)
Inside my arms you'll find a happy home
Anytime that life has got you down
You know I'll watch over you like the stars above
Maybe there's not a lot that I can do
So baby, this I dedicate to you
We sing this song for you tonight (Tonight)

[Verse 2: Nathan Morris]
Stars
It's hard to imagine how
The sparkle in the skies are reflections of the sun
And the color in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Stockman]
Every time that you stumble and fall
You bear the power to shoulder it all
One by one they're written in the chapters in
The story of me and you
This ain't no fairytale

[Chorus: Boyz II Men & Shawn Stockman]
Maybe you're wandering again, oh no
I know you're hurting, what you running for?
Every time you break away from me
You know you're sailing alone on the stormy seas
You've cried a river, and can't cry no more
I've got the key, it's time to open that door
We sing this song for you tonight (Tonight)

[Post-Chorus: Wanya Morris]
No one can replace this story of you and your life
This ain't no fairytale

[Bridge: Boyz II Men & Wanya Morris]
Close your eyes and I can make you smile
Together we can reminisce a while (Reminisce)
Open up so you can breathe again
And find a way to portray what your heart is saying
(Find a way, oh)
I'll make a wish so it'll all come true
So baby, this I dedicate to you
We sing this song for you tonight
This song for you tonight, help me

[Outro: Boyz II Men & Wanya Morris]
Baby, you're never gonna be alone
(Never gonna be alone)
Inside my arms you'll find a happy home
(Find a happy home)
Anytime that life has got you down
You know I'll watch over you like the stars above
Maybe there's not a lot that I can do (I can do)
But baby, this one I dedicate to you
We sing this song for you tonight (Tonight)
And I sing this song for you tonight
The things that I used to do, lord, I won't do no more
Said the things that I used to do, say I won't do no more, yeah
I used to run and hold your hand baby and cry, oh babe do not go child

I used to search all night for you baby
All my search would all end in vain
Said I search all night for you
Lord, and my search would all end in vain
But I knew all the time baby now
That you was hid out wit' your other man

I'm goin' to lead you on home dear baby
Try somewhere else love one more time
Gonna lead you home dear baby
Try somewhere else love one more time
The way you mistreat me child
I'm about to lose my mind

[Spoken: CeeLo & Man]
I mean, shit Lo, what don't you do?
Fuck around, oh
Hahaha, get 'em, Kingston, hit it

(drums playing)

Hehehe

That year in Oakland High
When I was seventeen
The grass from there to San Jose
Was high and cool and green
I see it now

Too brash and young was I
To know what time could mean
The old Acacia lawn cut down
Was felt but never seen
I see it now

That world I knew is lost to me
Loves have come and gone

The years go racing by
I live as best I can
And all at once I know it means the making of a man
I see it now
I see it now
I see it now
People
Keep on learnin'
Soldiers
Keep on warrin'
World
Keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long
Powers
Keep on lyin'
While your people
Keep on dyin'
World
Keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long

I'm so darn glad He let me try it again
'Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Gonna keep on tryin' till I reach the highest ground

Teachers
Keep on teachin'
Preachers
Keep on preachin'
World
Keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long
Oh no
Lovers
Keep on lovin'
While believers
Keep on believin'
Sleepers
Just stop sleepin'
'Cause it won't be too long
Oh no
I'm so darn glad He let me try it again
'Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Gonna keep on tryin' till I reach the highest ground

And Stevie knows that, uh, nobody's gonna bring me down
Till I reach the highest ground
'Cause me 'n' Stevie, see, we're gonna be a sailin' on the funky. funky sound
Till I reach the highest ground
Bustin' out, and I'll break you out, 'cause I'm sailin' on
Till I reach the highest ground
Just, uh, sailin' on, sailin' on the higher ground
Till I reach the highest ground

[Intro: Daddy Watsie]
?

[Verse 1: Mark Morrison]
All of these girls trippin' on me (trippin')
See here now I'm goin' crazy ever since
I went Number One (like a bomb)
My whole world pandemonium

[Chorus: Mark Morrison]
Everybody crazy turnin' on me
Can't dis a brother for going silly
Everybody crazy trippin' on me
Ain't nothin' wrong standing strong

[Verse 2: Mark Morrison]
Walking my 'hood day and night (day and night)
People saying Mark ain't right no (you're crazy)
Doing wrong souped on my song (step off)
Ain't nothing changed leave me alone

[Chorus: Mark Morrison]
Everybody crazy frontin' on me (step off)
Why dis a brother (jungle) for keeping street
Everybody crazy (you're crazy) trippin' on me (you're crazy)
Tell me what's wrong movin' on

[Verse 3: Daddy Watsie]
Well true we are badder than that
We rougher than that
We tougher than that
We are the wickedest wickedest yout's on the counteract
That nuff a' them wants to see us rise then go see us drop
We're not gonna stop rise until we done hit the top
So don't dispute the wrong just dispute the facts
That if we're coming back we're coming back well phat
So don't believe the hype just go and back your chat
Because round the corner you will find the golden jackpot

[Verse 4: Mark Morrison]
Gonna live my life doing my thing (my thing)
Despite the trippin' strong I said yeah
Ain't up on type doggin' my swing (for real)
My prerogative can never change

[Chorus: Mark Morrison]
Everybody crazy turnin' on me
Can't dis a brother for going silly
Everybody crazy (you're crazy) trippin' on me (you're crazy)
Tell me what's wrong moving on

[Verse 5: Daddy Watsie]
(Crazy) true they are turning crazy crazy
Yes definitely crazy
Like to say they want to change our personalities
No crazy crazy like mentally crazy
But hip-hop ragamuffin DJ
Is not going to let them get to we (crazy)
Because nuff a' them try hard just to blank we
But they can't get us out of their memory
Those who can't believe it or even see we
Might as well hear we out in reality

[Chorus: Mark Morrison]
Everybody crazy all of these girls (everybody)
Trippin' on me (everybody) see me now (everybody)
I'm going crazy (I don't wanna talk to you no more)
(Crazy) all of these girls
Trippin' on me

(Crazy) all of these girls
Trippin' on me
See me now
I'm going crazy
(Crazy) all of these girls
Trippin' on me
See me now
I'm going crazy
Oh baby, don't you want a man like me
Oh baby, don't you want a man like me
I can love you baby
Better than your used-to-be

Oh baby, don't you need a man like me
Oh baby, don't you need a man like me
I can love you baby
Better than any man in town

Oh baby, don't you want a man like me
Oh baby, don't you want a man like me
I can love you baby
Better than your used-to-be

[Verse 1]
I'll try to keep myself open up to you
That's a promise that I made to love when it was new
"Just like Jericho" I said, "Let these walls come tumbling down"
I said it like I finally found the way to keep the good feelings alive
I said it like it was something to strive for

[Verse 2]
I'll try to keep myself open up to you
And approve your self expression, I need that, too
I need your confidence, baby, and the gift of your extra time
In turn I'll give you mine
Sweet darling, it's a rich exchange, it seems to me
It's a warm arrangement

[Bridge]
Anyone will tell you just how hard it is to make and keep a friend
Maybe they'll short sell you, or maybe it's you, Judas, in the end
When you just can no longer pretend
That you're getting what you need
Or you're giving out anything for them to grow and feed on

[Verse 3]
I'll try to keep myself open up to you
It gets easier and easier to do
Just like Jericho, let these walls come tumbling down now
Let them fall right on the ground
Let all these dogs go running free
The wild and the gentle dogs kenneled in me
I can hear my name ringin', ringin' all up and down the line
Yes I can hear my name ringin', ringin' all up and down the line
I don't believe my woman loves me, I believe I'm just messin' up my time

Yes, I have the blues before sunrise, with the tears gettin' to my eyes
I have the blues before sunrise and the tears gettin' to my eyes
Yes, I get that funny feeling, it's the feeling I do despise

Yes, last night as I laid there dreamin', I was layin' there by myself
Yes, last night as I laid dreamin', I was layin' there by myself
I was just thinkin' if my woman don't love me, I hope she's not in love with nobody else
Tell me a line - make it easy for me
Open your arms
Dance with me until I feel all right
It's good in the dark, good in the dark
But into the lover's light
Here comes another fight

So ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Bore me and hold me and cling to my arm
Here it comes, here it comes

And what you're asking me now, disastrous now
Hoping and hoping and hoping
The feeling goes away

Never change, never change, never change, never change
Never change, never change, never change
This is why I fell in love .. oooh

Never change, never change, never change, never change
Never change, never change, never change
That's just who I fell in love with
(in love...)
Oh this is the time, the very best time
So give me a line and take me home
Take me over

But dashing the hopes, dashing the hopes
And smashing the pride
The morning's got you on the ropes .. ooh

And love is a murderer, love is a murderer
But if she calls you tonight
Everything is all right
(Yeah we know)
And love is a curse shoved in a hearse
Love is an open book to a verse of your bad poetry
And this is coming from me

But I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(in love)

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(in love)
Turn on the light - make it easy for me
Fill the divide fumble in the kitchen
'til it's right
(What an awful sight)

But there's love in your eyes
Love in your eyes, love in your eyes
But maybe that's just your love of fights
All night!

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(in love)

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(in love)

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you feel real love
(real love)

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(in love)

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I wake up early in the morning and it feels so good
Smoking on some shit that you wish you could
Jealousy envy, please don't feel bad
This weed is mine get your own bag
A sack full of og under locking key
None for the homies this is all for me
Got a blunt looking like a Cali palm tree
Police roll by, I got nothing on me
Cause the smoke is already in the air
I am loped up two braids in my hair
All Star with the khaki suit
I'm gonna fuck around and take it to the classic snoop
On the east side standing on the vip
Back then the only red was my DYE
Used to PYT and you're looking so fine
I am sorry baby girl but tonight

[Chorus: Wiz khalifa]
This weed is mine
This weed is mine
You can't have it
This weed is mine
This weed is mine
You can't have it
This weed is mine

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Get back to the episode, sacks for the chronic
Out of this world, could relax on a comet
This is church music listen to the choir
To burn my kush you must use fire
Dogg like never heard before
Smoking that bomb like THC-4
West coast world wide sea shore to sea shore
When is the last time you've seen a g in a g4
Don't worry i'll wait
Time is ticking i'm tripping
I'm slipping, i'll wait
Into a zone where the whores on my dog bone
A dog whistle and they download my ring tone
And she so hypnotized by this pimp poem
What i got here is mine go get your own
I put this to rhymes get piece of mind
OZs to dimes and this weed is mine

[Chorus: Wiz khalifa]
This weed is mine
This weed is mine
You can't have it
This weed is mine
This weed is mine
You can't have it
This weed is mine

[Verse 3: Wiz khalifa]
I hear niggas talking about what they rolling up
Smell what i smoke fore the bag open up
Good chance if you see me there I'm smoking one
Licensed to get a fundamental load of shit
Real nigga blow reefer i is old enough
If i am in a building is hard not to notice it
Hit a really sad dog, i got some whores to fuck
IIma follow through with a ounce of that potent shit (oh oh)
Don't trip bitch we gonna all sit blow the whole zip
Let you hit mine plus you supplyin your own little bit
My nigga get high and let the whores twist
Say you don't fuck with twista? how you rolled it
They ain't smoking like  ours I'm rolling up  papers they be burning for hours
And if it's fine i am smoking the whole thing inside

[Chorus: Wiz khalifa]
This weed is mine(a a a a yeah)
This weed is mine
You can't have it
This weed is mine
This weed is mine
You can't have it
This weed is mine

[Verse 4]
I got a roll for you
Do you wanna smoke with me
I wanna smoke with you(i wanna smoke with you)
Do you wanna smoke with me
I got a roll for you(I got a roll for you)
Do you wanna smoke with me(do you wanna smoke)
I wanna smoke with you do you do you (do you)
Do you wanna smoke with me(i said wanna smoke with you)
Do you wanna smoke with me(i wanna smoke with you)
I have never loved a lady
Never touched no silken knee
Macon baby, you drove me crazy
You were so easy to me

Lay me down in Georgia pine cones
Whisper to me through the trees
You're the one I always dream of
You're the only one I see

Whoa, slow dancer, sweet romancer
Shine your light on me
Slow dancer holds the answer
Only you can set me free

Never see your face in sunlight
Moonlight sends you straight to me
You never even got my name right
You were so easy to me

Whoa, slow dancer, sweet romancer
Shine your light on me
Slow dancer give me the answer
Only you can set me free
Slow dancer, sweet romancer
Shine your light on me
Slow dancer give me the answer
No I'm not the type of girl to say
Baby, if you wanna play you pay
No way, I'm not that kind
Oh yeah, I've got love on my mind
Down in the quarter
Out on the corner, walkin' the line
They say romance without finance
That's a crime

Mercy me, heavens above!
What's money got to do with love?
I need a squeeze without a doubt
Won't put my hold on your bank account
I need a lover
Under the cover of the night
And if it's romance without finance
That's all right

Let us give you some free advice
Say that love must have its price
Can't you see girl, you're wastin' your time
That boy, he ain't got a dime
They don't know if your love is true
They don't see what I see in you
You got a touch, feelin' so fine
I don't care about your bottom line

Down in the quarter
Almighty dollar's on their minds
But I'll take romance over finance
Every time

I don't care what your daddy do
I don't care if your blood is blue
Legal tender's bringin' me down
It ain't what makes my world go round

I need a lover
Seens me some tender eyes that shine
I'll take my romance over finance
Every time

Romance without finance
And I'll take romance over finance
Every time
The teacher of truth told tales
Of trouble times that would begin
And the cynical sower sowed
The sorrowful seeds of seven sins

The people placed a price upon
The prince of perfect peace
And the one who wooed the world was wounded
Look unto the east

The morning moved in mournfully
With many moments marred
By brawny beast who beat the beauty
Bound and bit and barred

They laid the lash upon him low
His lips moved not the least
Watch him come from where he did go
Look unto the east

The devil drew his darts
And the dearest dove came droppin' down
But the spirits slips in soft and sweetly
Unseen with no sound
The comforter, the counselor
With us till time is ceased
And the groom will return for his bride
Look unto the east
Well you can't be my lovin' baby
You ain't gotta style
I'm gonna get some real good love
Gonna drive those cool cats wild

I'm gonna move, move on down the line
Wanna get some love, a love that's truly fine

Oh I'm gonna show you a-way so hot
I'm gonna get what you ain't got
She'll be cool, she'll be wrong
She'll be cool and twice as strong

Gonna roll roll on down the line
Wanna get some love, a love that's truly fine

Why! come on now

Yeah, Move on down the line
Wanna get some love that's truly fine
She'll be cool, she'll be long
She'll be cool and twice as strong
Gonna roll, roll on down the line
Gonna get some love, a love that's truly fine

Oh let's sing it again one time now

Yeah, move on down the line
Wanna get some love that's truly fine
She'll be cool, she'll be long
She'll be cool and twice as strong

Gonna roll, roll on down the line
Wanna get some love, a love that's truly fine

Yeah, move (Yeah gonna move)
I'm gonna move (Yeah gonna move)
I'm gonna move (Yeah gonna move)
What good am I?
Long live time
For all kind
There poems
Song in my heart
Skull in my pocket
What good am I?
Time takes a stage
Drowned out
Wine, women and advertsiing
No, no, no
Currency exchange
That's easy for you to say
I dont need anything x2
I don't need ..
I need you
Funny thing about this little heart of mine
All the ways that it can say
(I love you)
Longer than forever
Till the end of time
No matter baby come what may
(I love you)
Look at me now sittin' all by myself
Face another sleepless night all alone
All I look forward to is lying here living this song

I can't escape thinking every day about you
Can't escape wishing dear you were still mine
Can't escape thinking maybe I still love you
Can't escape caring for you all of the time

Listen to the music on the radio
Top forty hits of yesterday
(I love you)
Leavin' on a Jet Plane
Blowin' in the Wind
The Silly Games that People Play
(I love you)
Each of them carries your memory still
I can still see that look in your eyes
The one that preceded your kisses and followed your sighs
I can't escape thinking every day about you
Can't escape wishing dear you were still mine
Can't escape thinking maybe I still love you
Can't escape caring for you all of the time

Every rain in the morning reminds me of you
Every night when it's cold outside
Every time that I ache inside
(I love you)
(I love you)

Sometimes I wish it was ten years ago
We were starting all over again
Yet the way that I feel is much more than just remembering when

I can't escape thinking every day about you
Can't escape wishing dear you were still mine
Can't escape thinking maybe I still love you
Can't escape caring for you all of the time

All of the time
All of the time
I got a gal who's always late
Any time we have a date
But I love her
Yes I love her

I'm gonna walk right up to her gate
And see if I can get it straight
'Cause I want her
I'm gonna ask her

Is you is or is you ain't my baby
Way you're acting lately makes me doubt
Youse is still my baby, baby
Seems my flame in your heart's done gone out

A woman is a creature that has always been strange
Just when you're sure of what you'll find
She's gone and made a change

Is you is or is you ain't my baby
Maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true
Is you is or is you ain't my baby
Maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true
Jesus, our brother, kind and good
Was humbly born in a stable of wood
And the friendly beasts around Him stood
Jesus, our brother, kind and good

I said, the donkey, shaggy and brown
I carried His mother up hill and down
I carried His mother to Bethlehem town
I said, the donkey, shaggy and brown

I said, the sheep with curly horn
I gave Him my wool for a blanket warm
He wore my coat on Christmas morn
I said, the sheep with curly horn

I said, the dove from the rafters high
I cooed Him to sleep that He should not cry
We cooed Him to sleep my love and I
I said, the dove from rafters high

Thus, every beast by some good spell
In the stable dark was glad to tell
Of the gift he gave Emmanuel
Of the gift he gave Emmanuel
Mary had a little lamb
His fleece was white as snow
Ev'rywhere that Mary went
That lamb was sure to go
And you could hear them singing:
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

He followed her to school one day
It was against the rules
Made the children laugh and play to
See a lamb at school

You could hear them singing:
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Soon the teacher turned it out
Still it lingered near
Waited patiently about till
Mary did appear
You could hear them singing:
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

"But the lamb loved Mary so"
The eager children cry
"And Mary loves the lamb, you know"
The teacher did reply

And you could hear them singing:
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
(Ev'ry body singing)
I reached the age of forty somewhat sooner than expected
Living at a fairly hectic pace
When I count the years that I have happily collected
The future shows its apprehensive face
(But now, Francis, what the hell do you do now, Francis?)
Quite a different song must be sung
When the singer is no longer young
Before the music ends, before it fades away
There are several very necessary things I must do
Friends I must see again, certain places
Where I must be again
Before the music ends
I must go to Hoboken one more time

I wanna run down that street where that thin Italian kid ran
Then slow down at the school
Where those nice old ladies tried to teach me
Unaware that I knew much more than they did
And stop at the poolroom for a beer
And sadly say to myself, I don't know anybody here
(Francis, don't go home again.)
One thing I'd like to do
Before the music ends
Is to thank some wonderful life-long friends
I've never met but have known so well
From one Frank to another, thank you for your dream
Your dream is now my own
And thank you Ludwig Van
For the flights of fancy you sent me on
Thank Mrs. Verdi, for Joe and a special thanks to Giacomo

All of you took turns in delivering sunrise a little sooner to my window

Before the music ends, with company by Dino and Sarge
I'd like to make one more charge at Vegas
You won't find me at that idiot wheel that spins, and spins and spins
I won't play the slot machine
The management always wins
Not for me the game where the Jack is called Black:
Hand me them dice and stand back!
(Put five hundred on the line
And a hundred on the come
If Sinatra makes his Nine, blow the trumpets, beat the drum!)
You won't hear me talk about baby‘s new shoes, baby's got 57 pairs...
All I ask is a Nine, just a plain and simple Nine
(just a little five and four, just a little six and three
Nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine)
Nine!!! 

[dice rolls]

[cello solo]
In years to come, I may forget if I lost or if I won
But I'll always remember how much fun it was
(just a little five and four, just a little six and three)

And when the music ends
I'd like it to end this way
I'll ask Chester to write me one more song
I'll get Lefty to make me one more chart
And I'll make one more record with the best musicians in the world

And when that cat with the scythe
Comes tugging at my sleeve
I'll be singing as I leave
(Sinatra, Sinatra, Sinatra)
Joe Cool... Back in school
Hangin' round the water fountain
Playin' the fool

Joe Cool... Take it light
If the principal catches you
You're out of sight
(Take those shades off... Walkin' round the halls.)

Joe Cool... Makin' the rounds
Checkin' all the kiddies
Up and down

Joe Cool... Play it straight
If the principal catches you
It's gon-na... Be... Too late
(Yeaaahhh... Better learn to add now.)

A few years later, in the tv special "There's No Time
For Love, Charlie Brown, " the song collected a few more
Verses. To reflect Snoopy's temporary responsibilities
As a supermarket check-out clerk, these lines were
Added:
Joe Cool... After school
Workin' in the supermarket
Just like a mule

Joe Cool... Do it right
And be careful of the manager
He's dy-na-mite

Check each item... Get those prices right!

Joe Cool... Straighten things out
Take it easy, buddy...
You don't have to shout

Joe Cool... Just relax
If you bug the poor ol' manager
You get the ax

Pay attention... Don't you mess things up!

Joe Cool... After school
Working in the supermarket
Breaking the rules

Joe Cool... Playin' the clown
Just be careful of the shopping carts
They're goin'... To bring... You down
Yeah... Goin' for a ride now...
Time for supper now
Day's been hard and I'm so tired
I feel like eating now
Smell the kitchen now
Hear the maid whistle a tune
My thoughts are fleeting now

Still I dream of it
Of that happy day
When I can say I've fallen in love
And it haunts me so
Like a dream that's
Somehow linked to all the stars above

Young and beautiful
Like a tree that's just been planted
I found life today
I made mistakes today
Will I ever learn the lessons
That all come my way
Still I dream of it
Of that happy day
When I can say I've fallen in love
And it haunts me so
Like a dream that's
Somehow linked to all the stars above

When I was younger
My mother told me
Jesus loved the world
And if that's true then
Why hasn't he helped me to find a girl
And find my world

'Til then I'm just a dreamer
I'm convinced of it
The hypnosis of our minds can take us far away
It's so easy now
You see someone up there high
And heaven's here to stay

Still I dream of it
Of that happy day
When I can say I've fallen in love
And it haunts me so
Like a dream that's
Somehow linked to all the stars above
I'll find my world
I'll find my world
Someday I'll find my world
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah

[Refrain]
I am Lakota
Lakota

[Verse 1]
Looking at money man
Diggin' the deadly quotas
Out of balance, out of hand
We want the land

[Verse 2]
Lay down the reeking ore
Don't you hear the shrieking in the trees?
Everywhere you touch the earth she's sore
Every time you skin her all things weep

[Verse 3]
Your money mocks us
Restitution, what good can it do?
Kenneled in metered boxes
Red dogs in debt to you

[Refrain]
I am Lakota
Lakota

[Verse 4]
Fighting among ourselves
All we can say with one whole heart
Is we won't sell, no, we'll never sell
We want the land

[Verse 5]
The lonely coyote calls
In the woodlands, footprints of the deer
In the barrooms, poor drunk bastard falls
In the courtrooms, deaf ears, sixty years

[Verse 6]
You think we're sleeping
But quietly like rattlesnakes and stars
We have seen the trampled rainbows
In the smoke of cars

[Chorus]
I am Lakota, brave sun, pity me
I am Lakota, broken moon, pity me
I am Lakota, grave shadows stretching
Lakota, oh pity me
I am Lakota, weak grass, pity me
I am Lakota, faithful rocks, pity me
I am Lakota, meek standing water
Lakota, oh pity me

[Refrain]
I am Lakota
Lakota

[Verse 7]
Standing on sacred land
We never sold these Black Hills
To the missile-heads, to the power plants
We want the land

[Verse 8]
The bullet and the fence
Broke Lakota, the black coats and the booze
Broke Lakota, courts that circumvent
Choke Lakota, nothing left to lose

[Verse 9]
Tell me, grandfather
You spoke the fur and feather tongues
Do you hear the whimpering waters
When the tractors come?

[Chorus]
I am Lakota, brave sun, pity me
I am Lakota, broken moon, pity me
I am Lakota, grave shadows stretching
Lakota, oh pity me
I am Lakota, weak grass, pity me
I am Lakota, faithful rocks, pity me
I am Lakota, meek standing water
Lakota, oh pity me

[Outro]
Sun, pity me
Mother earth, mother moon, pity me
Father sky, father shadows stretching on the forest floor
Mother earth, oh pity me
Father sky, father grass, pity me
Mother earth, mother rocks, pity me
Father sky, father water standing in a wakan manner
Mother earth, oh pity me
Down, down, down deeper into love
All around, I can feel your love
All my life I've been dreaming
Night into morning
Till you opened my eyes

Love, love, love such a mystery
Golden light shining down on me
Soft and warm as the warming
But I never saw it
Till you opened my eyes

Floating in circles, I'm flying
It feels so good that I'm crying

Down, down, down deep inside of me
Love sweet love's all that I can see
Golden light keeps on shining
Shining forever, since you opened my eyes

[Verse]
Bones, sinking like stones
All that we fought for
Homes, places we’ve grown
All of us are done for

[Chorus]
We live in a beautiful world
Yeah, we do, yeah, we do
We live in a beautiful world

[Verse]
Bones, sinking like stones
All that we fought for
Homes, places we’ve grown
All of us are done for

[Chorus]
And we live in a beautiful world
Yeah, we do, yeah, we do
We live in a beautiful world

[Piano Solo]

[Chorus]
And we live in a beautiful world
Yeah, we do, yeah, we do
We live in a beautiful world

[Outro]
Oh, all that I know
There's nothing here to run from
'Cause yeah, everybody here's got somebody to lean on
Out on the lonely hillside in a cabin low and small
Lived the sweetest rose of color my Rosie McFall
Her eyes were bright and shining and her voice was sweet to me
Knew that I would always love her and I hoped that she loved me

My eyes turned to me, my darlin' and this is what she said:
You know that I would always love you when you and I are wed
Then God way up in heaven one day for her did call
I lost my bride, oh how I loved her, my Rosie McFall

I searched this wide world over through cities great and small
But I never found another like my Rosie McFall

[Verse 1]
I've been the needle and the thread
Weaving figure eights and circles round your head
I try to laugh but cry instead
Stretch my hands and feet to the corner of your bed

[Pre-Chorus]
Fumbling through your dresser drawer
Forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you cry

[Chorus]
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out

[Verse 2]
This is not goodbye, she said
It is just time for me to rest my head
She does not walk, she runs instead
Down these jagged streets and into my bed

[Pre-Chorus]
When I was fumbling through your dresser drawer
Forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you cry

[Chorus]
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out

[Bridge]
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Take 1!

[Verse 1]
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone
But it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

[Verse 2]
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in
But it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad

[Chorus 1]
Let me take you down
Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever

[Verse 3]
Always know sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know I mean, ah yes
But it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

[Chorus 2]
Let me take you down
Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields forever

[Outro]
Tonight I'm gonna break away
Just you wait and see
I've never been imprisoned by
A faded memory
Just when I think I'm over her
This broken heart will mend
I hear her name and I have to cry
The tears come down again

[Chorus]
It happens all the time
This crazy love of mine
Wrapped around my heart
Refusing to unwind
Ooh-ooh, crazy love, ah
Count the stars in the southern sky
That fall without a sound
And then pretend that you can't hear
These teardrops coming down

[Chorus]
Tonight I'm gonna break away
Just you wait and see
I've never been imprisoned by
A faded memory

[Chorus]
Tonight I'm gonna break away
See here's the thing

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

[Verse]
Excuse me miss
I couldn't help but to notice how alone you are
I dig the attitude and how you're actin' like you own the bar
Got me flashing keys and I don't even own a car
Like you ain't feeling my charm, because I know you are
I'm trying to see how your lips feel
Oh I'm sorry, my name is Travie and I'm pretty much a big deal
Oh, you've never heard of me?
Hmm, that sounds absurd to me
The way you stole my attention was flat out burgulary
What do you say let's exit stage left so me and you can
Possibly reconvene and play some naked peekaboo
Cause after all the blouse you're wearing is kinda see through
And it's obvious I'm heading wherever you're leading me too
Such an angel with a devilish angle
I'm quite the certified sweet talker
And you're buying every line of it girl
And I don't really blame you
If I was in your shoes I'd probably do the same too

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

[Verse]
Now here's another bar, I'm coming for the slow gunners
Put your helmets on and take a seat on the short bus
Next stop, right around the corner from your mom and 'em
No turning back so you better buckle up
Shit, don't be concerned with mine
I feel like a Speak and Spell way I got you learning my lines
Fine, pull the string, replay that shit
I change my name to "Did He Really Just Say That Shit?"
Yep
I'll take a mile if you let me
6-5, 200 plus and so sexy
My legs going numb for keeping my phone on vibrate
To hide the fact your girlfriend keeps textin' me
And I've been tryin' to never mind it man
But every time I get a new number, she finds it damn
And you thought you had it sewn up
Until right around amazing o'clock when I showed up

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks

[Verse]
Good god girl, you're giving me goosebumps
Standing there in your underwear and new pumps
It's like the more time we waste and less time I get to taste you
Honestly I could easily replace you
It's not a scam girl
That's how I am girl
Peter Pan, I'm a sucker for Smucker's jam girl
It's clear I'm only here for good clean fun
Shut up and kiss me like the antidote's under my tongue
Whoa

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie rock chicks, and hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie rock chicks, and hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Damn

[Verse 1]
My mind is made up 'cause you're so cold
I want your love to have and to hold
I'll have your love but you are so fine
Mind over matter, gonna make you mine

[Verse 2]
And I believe that someone wants to fall in love
The way I want you for you're the one that I love
I'll command all my powers to make you fall in line
Mind over matter, gonna make you mine

[Chorus]
I'll put a spell on you, put a hex on you
I'll make you love me too and I'll be so nice to you
You have to fall 'cause I'll be so dog gon' tired
Mind over matter, gonna make you mine

I'll put a spell on you, I'll put a hex on you
I'll make you love me too and I'll be so nice to you
You have to fall 'cause I'll be so dog gon' tired
Mind over matter, gonna make you mine
Oh baby, so nice, ohh
Oh baby
Stormy nights, I've been waiting
Satisfy you, oh yeah
But his love is just a game
And he's sellng you the same old lies

And I'm hangin' on the wire
And no closer to the fire
And you don't hear me when I cry

You may need someone to lean upon
When he's gone, when he's gone
And what is left is a love so strong
When he's gone, when he's gone
You wouldn't believe to what extent
My mind is going to
You wouldn't deny me in your dreams
You couldn't belong to someone else
If you could see me now
And I'd be the only one
When he's gone
My understanding that you remember
For whom the bell tolls, oh yeah
I swear to you I pray
That you feel the battle rage
For the saving of my soul

And it's a struggle to survive
You know it's keepin' us alive
And baby I don't wanna die

I will be someone you lean upon
When he's gone, when he's gone
And what is left is a love so strong
When he's gone, when he's gone
You wouldn't believe to what extent
My mind is going to
You wouldn't deny me in your dreams
You couldn't belong to someone else
If you could see me now
And I'd be the only one
When he's gone

I will be someone you lean upon
When he's gone, when he's gone
And what is left is a love so strong
When he's gone, when he's gone
I will be someone you lean upon
When he's gone, when he's gone
Don't tell me it's too late
And your love don't make me wait
I can see the end of time
With a love that makes you mine
And tonight I let you know
There's a love that won't let go
My old man had a rounder's soul
He'd hear an old freight train
Then he'd have to go

Said he'd been blessed with a gypsy bone
That's the reason I guessed
He'd been cursed to roam

Came into town back before the war
Didn't even know what it was
He was looking for

Carried a tattered bag for his violin
It was full of lots of songs
The places that he'd been

He talked real easy had a smiling way
To pass along to you
When his fiddle played

Making people drop their cares and woes
To hum out loud those tunes
That his fiddle bowed
Till the people there began to join that sound
Everyone in town was laughing
Singing, dancing round

Like the fiddler's tune was all they heard that night
As if some dream said
"All the world is right"

His fiddler's eye caught one beauty there
She had that rollin' flowin'
Golden kind of hair

He played for her as if she danced alone
Played his favorite songs
Ones he called his own

He played until she was the last to go
He stopped and packed his case
Said he'd take her home

All the nights that passed a child was born
All the years that passed
That love would keep them warm

All their lives they'd share a dream come true
All because she danced
While his fiddle tuned
My old man he had a rounder's soul
He'd hear an old freight train
Then he'd have to go

All that I recall he said when I was so young
No one else could really
Sing those songs he sung
I was standing on the corner, wondering what's become of me
I was standing on the corner, wondering what's become of me
Well things don't seem to be the way they used to seem to be

I think I'll go up on a mountain, I'll fling myself off into space
I think I'll go up on a mountain, I'll fling myself off into space
I'm not doing it because I'm desperate, I'm just trying to save some space

If you ask me what my name is, I'll just stop and scratch my head (note 1)
If you ask me what my name is, I'll just stop and scratch my head
Well they took away my name and gave me a number instead

Well all the things I used to know seem so far behind
There's a lot of new things that are running around my mind
I'm growing tired of the big city nights
Tired of the glamour and tired of the sights
In all my dreams I am roaming once more
Back to my home on the old river shore

I am sad and weary far away from home
Miss the Mississippi and you dear
Nights are dark and dreary everywhere I roam
Miss the Mississippi and you

Roaming the wide world over
Always alone and blue, so blue
Nothing seems to cheer me under heaven's dome
Miss the Mississippi and you

Memories are bringing happy days of yore
Missing Mississippi and you
Mocking birds are singing around the cabin door
Missing Mississippi and you

Rolling the wide world over
Always alone and blue, so blue
Longing form my homeland, muddy water shore
Miss the Mississippi and you
Written by Danny Kirwan

What time is it?
Under a blanket of blue
Just you and I beneath the stars
Wrapped in the arms of sweet romance
The night is ours
Under a blanket of blue
Let me be thrilled by all your charms
Darling, I know my heart will dance
Within your arms
A summer night's magic, enthralling me so
The night would be tragic
If you weren't here to share it my dear
Covered with heaven above
Let's dream a dream of love for two
Wrapped in the arms of sweet romance
Under a blanket of blue
Covered with heaven above
Let's dream a dream of love for two
Wrapped in the arms of sweet romance
Under a blanket of blue
Close your eyes my pretty child, though the night is dark and the wind is wild
I will stand beside your bed, tonight there is nothing you need fear or dread
You can sleep now, go to sleep, the rain falls and the windows weep
I'm standing by to sing a lullaby

Close your eyes my sister fair, though the snow is falling and the trees are bare
And I will hold you by the hand, tonight there is nothing you need try to understand
You can sleep now, go to sleep. The daytime's dying and the nighttime's so deep
I'm standing by to sing a lullaby

Close your eyes my mother wise when the waves are angry and the north train cries
I stopped those ghosts outside your door, Mama, don't worry about those ghosts no more
You can sleep now, go to sleep, tomorrow comes but it will keep
I'm standing by to sing a lullaby, another lullaby, another lullaby, another lullaby
Frankie: Janie Jane Powell, spare us a few minutes before the hour. Something must be said for a
Song, from what was undoubtedly Jerome Kern's most memorable score. It's you and I, sweetie, with the
One of the loveliest songs in that show, Show Boat

Frankie: We could make believe I love you, only make believe that you love me
Janie: All that fine piece of mind in pretending, couldn't you, couldn't I, couldn't we?
Frankie: Make believe our lips are blending in a phantom kiss or two or three
Janie: Might as well make believe I love you, for to tell the truth, I do
(interlude)
Frankie: Make believe our lips are blending in a phantom kiss or two or three
Both: Might as well make believe I love you, for to tell truth, I do
Some change comes down for the better
You feel it move
Then some come around like the weather
You take that in too
But like some change in your pocket
Sometimes it seems to be too little too late

I guess it's time to break out a few pesos
Cause I'm getting to where I like the view
And if you're feeling lucky and
You ain't just passing through
You might change some too

There was a time I was lowdown for action
Red hot as a rule
Certified guaranteed satisfaction
One happening fool
And now I know I was missing the boat
Now I know I was missing it by a country mile

Like Noah said you'd better wake up
You don't want to get stuck in this zoo
Cause when he leaves the dock
He ain't waiting round for you
Be prepared to change some too
Some change comes down for the better
You feel it move
Then some come around like the weather
You take that in too
Well well
You take that in too

And if you're feeling lucky
Be prepared to change some too
Mmm hmmm

Yeah well
Alright
Yeah well

Some change...some don't
Yeah well
Need someone's hand to lead me through the night
I need someone's arms to hold and squeeze me tight
Now, when the night begins, whoa, I'm at an end
Because I need your love so bad

I need some lips to feel next to mine
Need someone to stand up - to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin'
And when the lights are low - and it's time to go
That's when I need your love so bad

So why don't you give it up, baby and bring it home to me
Or write it on a piece of paper, woman - so it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me - and stop drivin' me mad
Whoa, because I - I need your love so bad

Need a soft voice - just to talk to me at night
Don't want you to worry, baby
I know we can make everything alright
Listen to my plea, baby, come on bring it to me
'Cause I need - your love so bad
Baby, I need, I need - woman, I need your love so bad
Little bitty boy, with a heart of steel
I know you can't boggie now, but your sister sure will
Feel good music in your soul
Makes your body wanna rock 'n' roll
Say Hey Hey Hey, Hey Pocky Way
Hey Hey, Hey Pocky Way
Laugh back foolin' in your car
Makes no difference who or where you are
Feel good music in your soul
Makes your body wanna rock 'n' roll
Hey Hey Hey, Hey Pocky Way
Hey Hey, Hey Pocky Way
Laugh back foolin' in your car
Makes no difference who or where you are
Feel good music in your soul
Makes your body wanna rock 'n' roll
Hey Hey Hey, Hey Pocky Way
Hey Hey, Hey Pocky Way
Hey Hey Hey, Hey Pocky Way
Hey Hey, Hey Pocky Way
Hey Hey Hey, Hey Pocky Way
Hey Hey, Hey Pocky Way
Hey Hey Hey, Hey Pocky Way
Hey Hey, Hey Pocky Way
Life is like a mountain railway
With an engineer that's brave
We must make the run successful
From the cradle to the grave

Heed the curves and watch the tunnels
Never falter, never fail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail

Blessed Savior, Thou will guide us
Till we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us
In that train forevermore

Oh, Blessed Savior, Thou will guide us
Till we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us
In God's grace forevermore

[Verse 1]
Oh, a father waits upon his son
A mother prays for his return
I just called to see
If you still have a place for me
We know that life took us apart
But you're still within my heart
I go to sleep and feel your spirit next to me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'll make it home again
I pray you'll fall in love again
Just say you'll entertain the possibility
I learned enough from my mistakes
Learned from all I didn't say
Won't you wait for me?

[Chorus]
It may be long to get me there
Feels like I've been everywhere
But someday I'll be coming home
Round and round the world will spin
Oh, the circle never ends
So you know that I'll be coming home

[Verse 2]
We fight to stay alive
But somebody's got to die
It's so strange to me
A new year, a new enemy
Another soldier gone to war
Another story told before
Now it's told again
It seems the wars will never end

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But we'll make it home again
Back where we belong again
We're holding on to when
We used to dare to dream
We pray we live to see
Another day in history
Yes, we still believe

[Chorus]
It may be long to get me there
It feels like I've been everywhere
But someday I'll be coming home
Round and round the world will spin
Oh, the circle never ends
So you know that I'll be coming home

[Bridge]
Coming home (I'm coming, I'm coming)
Coming home  (I'm coming, I'm coming)
(I'm coming, I'm coming)
You know that I'll be coming home
(I'm coming, I'm coming)
Coming home (I'm coming, I'm coming)
I'll be coming  (I'm coming, I'm coming)
You know that I'll be coming home
I'll be coming home
Won't you lift me?
Won't you pray for me? Yeah
I'll be coming home

[Chorus]
It may be long to get me there
Feels like I've been everywhere
But someday I'll be coming home

Don't go jumping waterfalls
Please keep to the lake
People who jump waterfalls
Sometimes can make mistakes

And I need love
Yeah, I need love
Like a second needs an hour
Like a raindrop needs a shower

Yeah, I need love
Every minute of the day
And it wouldn't be the same
If you ever should decide to go away

And I need love
Yeah, I need love
Like a castle needs a tower
Like a garden needs a flower

Yeah, I need love
Every minute of the day
And it wouldn't be the same
If you ever should decide to go away
Don't go chasing polar bears
In the great unknown
Some big friendly polar bear
Might want to take you home

And I need love
Yeah, I need love
Like a second needs an hour
Like a raindrop needs a shower

Yeah, I need love
Every minute of the day
And it wouldn't be the same
If you ever should decide to go away

Don't run after motor cars
Please stay on the side
Someone's glossy motor car
Might take you for a ride

And I need love
Yeah, I need love
Like a castle needs a tower
Like a garden needs a flower

And I need love
Yeah, I need love
Like a raindrop needs a shower
Like a second needs an hour
Every minute of the day
And it wouldn't be the same
If you ever should decide to go away

Don't go jumping waterfalls
Please keep to the lake

The way things go
You get so low
Struggle to find your skin
Hey ho
Look out below
Your prayers will never be answered again
Phones still ring
And singers sing
Speakers are speaking in code
What now
Well anyhow
Our prayers will never be answered again
You know it's all beginning
(It's all beginning)
To feel like It's ending
(Feels like It's ending)
No loves as random
As God's love
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
The way things get
You get so high
Funny how we make new friends
Oh hey ho
I gotta go
My prayers will never be answered again
You know It's all beginning
(it's all beginning)
To feel like It's ending
(Feels like It's ending)
No loves as random
As God's love
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
Speakers speaking
Speakers speaking
Speaking in code
Speakers speaking
Speakers speaking
Speaking in code
You know It's all beginning
(it's all beginning)
To feel like pretending
(To feel like pretending)
No loves as random
As my love
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
Your prayers will never be answered again 

[Repeats]
I love you, I love you
Is all that I can say
I love you, I love you
The same old words I'm saying in the same old way

I love you, I love you
Three words that are divine
And now my dear, I'm waiting to hear
The words that will make you mine

Little girl, I love you
Can't you see I love you
I love you
Can't you see I love you

I love you, I love you
Three words that are divine
And now my dear, I'm waitin' to hear
The words that make you mine
When I was a young man
Just gotten out
I didn't know
What this world was all about
I was lied to, I was cheated
I played all kinds of fools
It didn't take me long
To learn the rules

Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, shame on me
Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, shame on me

Lady swore she loved me
Loved through and through
And then my pal said
She said she loved him, too
And the milkman and the postman
And in a dream
I saw her with the local
Football team
Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, shame on me
Fool me once
Do me as bad as you can do
Shame on you
Shame on you
Fool me twice
I'll be as mad as I can be
Shame on me
Shame on me

Banker took my money
Bought him a stake
The banker swore that one day
We'd both feel great
Then the 80's turned to the 90's
And my money can't be found
Banker's on a long trip
Out of town

Fool me once
Do me as bad as you can do
Shame on you
Shame on you
Fool me twice
I'll be as mad as I can be
Shame on me
Shame on me

Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat
Please put a penny in the old man's hat
Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat
Please put a penny in the old man's hat
Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat
Please put a penny in the old man's hat
Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat
Please put a penny in the old man's hat
If you haven't got a penny, a ha' penny will do
If you haven't got a ha' penny, then God bless you
Soft as a raindrop, fresh as the sea
Warm as the sunshine shining on me
This was my love, this was my love

Light was her laughter, few were her tears
Gentle her beauty, tender her years
This was my love, this was my love

So young, so fair, such bright golden hair
A smile always on her face
No other love can ever compare
No other can take her place

Others may cherish fortune or fame
I will forever cherish her name
For this was my love
This was my love!

[Intro: The Temptations]
Forgive this fool, my darlin'

[Verse 1: David Ruffin]
Oh, this heart of mine
Carries a heavy load
When I think about
How I've hurt you so
After you've been
Been so good to me
I've been unfaithful, darlin'
I've caused you misery
A feeling of guilt
How it tortures me
And only you, my darlin'
Oh, can set me free and

[Chorus: The Temptations]
And darlin', all
All I need
Is just to hear you say
You'll forgive me
Forgive me, baby
All, all I need
To have you touch my hand
Say you'll understand, baby

[Bridge: David Ruffin]
A moment of weakness, darlin'
Caused me to stray
Your trust in me, dear
I threw away

[Verse 2: David Ruffin]
When I look
Look into your eyes
I can see the hurt, baby
That you feel inside
Although I hurt you, baby
You never once complained
It makes me feel, sweet darlin'
That much more ashamed
Tears of guilt, tears of guilt
Runnin' down my face
Tears that only you, baby
Only you can erase

[Chorus: The Temptations]
And darlin', all
All I need
Is just to hear you say
You'll forgive me
Forgive me, baby
All, all I need
To have you touch my hand
Say you'll understand
Ooh
Forgive this fool, my darlin'

[Verse 3: David Ruffin]
I know I made a big mistake
When all your love, darlin'
Yes, I did forsake
It's on my mind
It's in my heart
This guilty feeling
Tearin' me apart
With every step I make
Every breath I take
I'll make it up to you
I'll make it up to you
Undo the wrong I've done
Undo the wrong I've done
I've been unfaithful
I know it's true
But I'll make it up to you, baby

[Chorus: The Temptations]
All, all I need
Is just to hear you say
You'll forgive me
Forgive me baby
All, all I need
To have you touch my hand
Say you'll understand
African sunrise, shine on a brand new day
African sunrise, show us a brand new way
Give us a brand new morning
Show us forever beginning to stand on our own
African sunrise, smile on my African home

In this hour of quiet contemplation
The stillness of the dawning calms my mind
I face the day with heartfelt exaltation
The light is both a promise and a sign

In the darkness we have lost the son of our sister
Though the beauty of his spirit lingers still
This was a child of love, a child of laughter
Who cannot understand the way I feel

Is it not the sun that gives the seasons
Is it not the sun that brings the rain
Our throats are choled with dust, but we're still singing
Our song will not be silenced by the rain
All around the village I could hear the roosters crowing
There was a time it was like music to my ears
Now all I can hear is the sound of hungry babies crying
I pray for rain to wash away their tears

African sunrise, light of a brand new day
African sunrise, light of a brand new way
With one who will be our brother
And one who will be our partner and teach us to know

African sunrise, smile on my African home
African sunrise...
African sunrise...
Yo, yo, yo, what's up, Nat the Cat?
(What's up?)
You know what i'm sayin', Donald D in the house
Homeboy Randy "King Quality" Mac in the motherfuckin' house
(You know what time it is)

Yo, yo, yo, trip off this homeboys, you know what i'm sayin', this motherfuckin' article right here says "Ice-T is violent", they trying to say i'm violent
(What kind of shit is that, Ice, man?)
Motherfuckers are tryin' to say that Rhyme Syndicate ain't about nothing but blood and violence...
(Ah, man, I ain't violent, man)
(Kill that noise)
(Suckers)

You know what i'm sayin', But trip off this, man, have you ever wondered what it'd sound like if a motherfucker took a drill, half-inch, and drilled right into the top of a motherfucker's head?
(Oh man, you'd need some Black & Decker 

[?], man)
(The cordless kind)
I wonder what that shit would sound like

[Sound effects]

Probably sound like that
(Shit, man)
I told you that I loved you, you said that is so good
I called you my darlin', I thought I always would
But now you've gone and left me, I don't know what to do
So my little darlin', I write these words to you

You dun stomped on my heart and you mashed that sucker flat
You just sorta stomped on my aorta
You started going out with guys, I felt us drift apart
And every step you took was a stomp upon my heart

I only hope that someday, you get them low down blues
In some smokey honky tonk, you looked down at your shoes
You'll think about that tender heart that you crushed beneath them soles
With your clod bustin' stompers, you left my heart so full of holes

You dun stomped on my heart and you mashed that sucker flat
You just sorta stomped on my aorta
You started going out with guys, I felt us drift apart
And every step you took was a stomp upon my heart
Every step you took was a stomp
Upon my heart

[Spoken Intro]
Well, boys and girls, it's Christmas time again

[Chorus]
So you better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Verse 1]
He's making a list
Checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Bridge]
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

[Chorus]
Oh, you better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Bridge]
(Now listen) He sees you when you're sleeping
(He sees you when you're sleeping)
(Oh yeah) and he knows when you're awake
(And he knows when you're awake)
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

[Chorus]
Oh, you better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Outro]
Ooh ooh, with little tin horns
And little toy drums
Rootie-toot-toot
And rum-pa-tum-tum
Santa Claus is coming to town
Oh, so, you better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Oh, I know there is no place you can go to
And I know you don't know anyone at all
So come walking in the sun with me my little one
And remember that the only time is now

Oh well, strange is the story your eyes tell me
And quiet all the few words that you say
So come and hold my hand, for you see, I'd understand
And remember that the only time is now

Oh, I come to you a ragged laughing stranger
And you come to me an angel of the night
So I'll dance and we will sing, for it doesn't mean a thing
To remember that the only time is now

So forget about your yesterdays of sorrow
And forget about the darkness you have seen
For there's only you and me at the edge of an endless sea
And remember that the only time is now

[Verse 1]
Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
That thin stewardess
Her skirt in a mess
You don't stand a chance

[Refrain]
What do you look like when you're nude
What do you look like when you're nude
What do you look like nude

[Verse 2]
Soulless reflection
In the other person's eyes
Death bed, first home
Damaged good, subject
Object none

[Verse 3]
So don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You'll go to hell
For what your dirty mind
Is thinking

[Refrain]
What do you look like when you're nude
What do you look like when you're nude
It's weirding me out
Oh, we want to call him Zachary
We'll raise him in the mountains
He'll bathe in the crystal fountains
Shining laughter in the sun

And we want to call her Jennifer
She'll dance in fields of flowers
She'll sing in summer showers
Lending music to the time

Oh, we want to live forever
In this mirror sea tomorrow
All the joy and all the sorrow
We can only hope to share
In the long, hot, thirsty summer of about 32 A.D
Along a dusty highway, there came a man of Galilee
And as he went through Samaria, he stopped at Jacob's well
And there he met a woman whose deep secrets he would tell

"Could I have a drink of water?", Soft and quietly asked he
And she said, "Sir, I'm Samaritan, how dare you speak to me?"
He said, "If you would ask of me than either son of man
Would give you living water and you'd never thirst again'

Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water
Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water
Dip in' to the endless well, pour it on the fires of hell
Have a drink and sing and shout as the flames of hell go out
Have a drink of water, everlastin', endless water

Then the woman said, "Sir, you have no way to draw out of this well
Our father Jacob dug it and the stories it could tell
From this well drank his children and his kettle by the score
Where is your well, Sir, tell me, that will flow forever more"
And he answered and said, "Unto her your water will go dry
And my well is everlastin', if you drink you'll never die€
My father God's a spirit and he set me under men
To give you living water so you'll never thirst again

Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water
Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water
Dip in' to the endless well, pour it on the fires of hell
Have a drink and sing and shout as the flames of hell go out
Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water

Well, there now are many thirstin' in this modern century
Whose thirst could be quenched quickly by the man from Galilee
For the water flows eternal from the well that never dries
For it flows right out of Heaven where the soul never dies

So if you're hot and tired and thirstin'
And if you crave a cool, tall drink
He will pour it right out for you a lot quicker than you think
He already knows you're thirsty so just let him come on in
And he'll give you livin' water and you'll never thirst again

Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water
Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water
Dip in' to the endless well, pour it on the fires of hell
Have a drink and sing and shout as the flames of hell go out
Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water
Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water, bro
Have a drink of water, ever last
Clap your hands and sing and shout
Hey gipsy boy
Where do you come from?
From the land (of the) new rising sun
Hey gipsy boy
Where do you plan to go to?

I'm gonna spread a lot of love
And of peace of mind, too
May i come along?

May i come along?
May i come along?
May i come along?

May i come along?

May i come along?
May i come along?

Hey gipsy boy
Where do you go to?
I'm gonna spread a lot of love
And of peace of mind, too
May i come along?
May i come along?
May i come along?
May i come along?

[Verse 1]
On the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is making music with my friends
And I just can't wait to get on the road again

[Verse 2]
On the road again
Goin' places that I've never been
Seein' things I may never see again
And I just can't wait to get on the road again

[Chorus]
On the road again
Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our way
And our way

[Verse 3]
Is on the road again
I just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
I just can't wait to get on the road again

[Chorus]
On the road again
Goin' places I've never been
Seein' things I may never see again
Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway

[Verse 4]
I just can't wait to get on the road again

[Outro]
That was good. That was a funky one. (Yeah yeah yeah)

[Verse 1]
Remember last summer
Under the shooting stars?
We made a wish were together forever
And let nobody tear us apart
And how fun was that ride down to Mexico?
We took a chance on those road side tacos
And we got sick by the side of the road

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And the fall came
And we had that big pot lot party;
And your little sixteen year old brother
Spilt wine all over my carpet
And I got mad, you thought it was funny
I stayed mad all winter;
It's so sad
A thing like that
Becomes such a splinter

[Chorus]
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So, I guess the driveway
Is the end of the road
For us it's too, late
Let the credits start to roll

[Verse 2]
I'm almost twenty-three
And I'm barely hanging on
I can't keep crashing couches
And going to sleep at dawn
And when were you going to take me somewhere that I can dress up?
Where we can act grown up
Do you ever wanna clean up?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We share a car, you thought it was okay
You couldn't have cut it closer
I'm sick of it, this is it;
And now the party's over

[Chorus]
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same, and
The story's getting old
So, I guess the driveway
Is the end of the road
For us it's too, late
Let the credits start to roll

[Bridge]
Someday, you'll make, some girl, happy;
I know, you'll get though
You'll know, just what, to say, to do;
Because I showed you

[Chorus]
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So, I guess the driveway
Is the end of the road
For us it's too, late
Let the credits start to roll

[Outro]
Let the credits start to roll
Oh, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yeah
Oh, it's too late, it's too late, it's too late
I guess the driveway; will be the end of the road

[Verse 1]
On lover's eve, I came to you
On hands and knees to beg
For all the things you meant to me
On lover's eve I cried as lover's day went by, ooh

[Verse 2]
On lover's eve, I laid with you
You wanted to be free
I felt your words so painfully
On lover's eve I cried as lover's day went by
Oh oh oh yeah, la da da, la da da da da da
Ooh, ooh ooh

[Verse 3]
As time goes on, I think of you
We just were not to be
You always say the need in you
On lover's eve I cried as lover's day went by

[Outro]
On lover's eve I cried as lover's day went by
On lover's eve, oh, lover's eve
As lover's day went by
Oh oh oh, la da da, la da da da da
La da da da da da, oh hoo hoo
Oh, lover's eve, lover's day
Hey, goodbye
Goodbye lover's eve
La da lover's eve
La da da da da, da da da da
Mhm, mmm, lover's eve
I can wait another day
Until I call you. (call you, call you)
You've only got my heart on a string
And ev'rything a'flutter, ooh

And another lonely night
Might take forever. (forever, forever, ever)
We've only got each other to blame
It's all the same to me, oh!

No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
I don't want no more lonely nights

May I never miss the thrill
Of being near you. (near you, near you, near you)
If it takes a number of years
I'll turn your tears away

But another lonely night
Might take forever. (forever, ever, ever...)
We've only got each other to blame
It's all the same to me, oo-ee, yeah
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Want no more, no more lonely nights

Mm-mm-mm-mm

Well, I don't want no more lonely nights
No, no more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
I don't want no more lonely nights

I couldn't take it again, ah, I'd be lonely
I couldn't take it
I couldn't take it again, ah, no, no

May I never miss the thrill
Of being near you. (near you, near you, near you...)
And if it takes a number of years
I'll turn your tears away

Mm-mm, I can wait another day until I call you
You've only got my heart on a string
Ev'rything a'flutter
But another lonely night
Might take forever. (forever, ever, ever)
We've only got each other to blame
It's all the same to me, to me, to me

No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Don't want no more, no more, no more lonely nights

No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Don't want no more, no more, no more lonely nights

No more lonely nights
Night, night, night, night
Night, night
Mm-mm-mm, baby, baby

[Intro]
To all the DJ's out there I appreciate the love
Let's show 'em why Pitbull one of the rawest (Mr. 305)

[Verse]
I'm one of the best, one of the rawest
Nah I ain't perfect but bitch I'm flawless
Nah I ain't stupid but the flow is retarded
Barely made high school, the streets was my college
Rappin here for years, workin and grindin
On the streets if you copped it, I supplied it
I've worked everything, every drug you name it
I've seen families get tied up for missin payments
Keep thinking that this thing is just entertainment
Disrepect, get introduced to the pavement
Catch me somewhere on the islands of Caymen
Me, I see the future, ya'll boys cavemen
Now it's cartoons and tv shows
First album gold, remix did fo, El Mariel in stores
I hustle (I hustle), I grind (I grind)
That's why they call me Mr. 305
Punctured bicycle
On a hillside desolate
Will nature make a man of me yet?

When in this charming car
This charming man

Why pamper life's complexity
When the leather runs smooth
On the passenger seat?

I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said "it's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care"

Ah! A jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said "return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said "it's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care"
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man
Oh, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man

Ah! A jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said "return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things

I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear

I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
Oh, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man
Oh, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man

Ah! A jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said "return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things

Is this just a carnival ride?
In..in..incubated society
Goldnigga
Be your own man

U stick around, but remember I'm the boss
And I give all the orders {laughter}
In this quiet place I stand alone
From my homeland far away
And my empty heart cannot recall
The forgotten dreams that brought me joy

Had I ways to shed the wasted years
I would travel to my kin
And with strength and faith in God above
There in Ireland I would gladly die
15 minutes, excuse me but I was wondering when
You were gonna speak 'cause I saw you look in
Back to the wall talking to all your friends
Thinking... loud... do you see me again
Let me find out, you ain't get that love like you should
Let me find out, he ain't putting it down, like you know I would
Girl I know what is what you're looking for
Girl I know what is just you need
And you're tired of rolling business
'Cause you need messing with me
Come and find out, just the reason why we're running now
Come and find out, what's all the hoopla, what's all the buzzing about
'Cause baby, you can get it, you can get it
Tell me to say the world and I ain't kill it
I'm no wasting your time, running my mind saying lies, to say what it's on my mind

[Chorus:]
If you give me 15 minutes I'll make you feel like a woman tonight
All I need is 15 minutes to take you on the ride of your life
Baby, all I need is 15 minutes anymore than that will kill the vibe
'Cause I bet you after 15 minutes, you need another 15, another 15 minutes of love
Is about to get crazy, about to go down
Seems like you're ready for the first round
Hope you can handle what I give out
This ain't a scandal, you stick around, is done now
Baby hold on to me don't let go
Don't act shy now, promise you be back begging for more
Im throwing that D as Im doing my thang
You looking back like I'm crazy, deranged
Told you to deal told you this ain't a game
You screaming out like you're going insane

Oooh, finally getting what you deserve
You can breathe now, giving you all of me that's my word
Baby, baby you can get it, you can get it
Tell me to save the world and I ain't go kill it
I'm no wasting your time, running my mind saying lies
To say what it's on my mind

[Chorus:]
If you give me 15 minutes I'll make you feel like a woman tonight
All I need is 15 minutes to take you on the ride of your life
Baby, all I need is 15 minutes anymore than that will kill the vibe
'Cause I bet you after 15 minutes, you need another 15 minutes, another 15 minutes to love

Time to re-up, time for my second win
Time to go in, that was just the beginning
Baby by now you should really know
Do what it was when you opened the door
Lets' get the school all night
I promise it will be all right

[Chorus]

Do you want another 15 minutes (it don't take long when you know what you're doing)
On the battlefield I am not commandeering
The war between the worlds, time to wield the cannons in
I am out here salamander-ing, they out here slandering
Try to smear nigga’s image down
Who’s the camera man?
Where’s the man to man talk
What a fuck?
Get up off the nipple, man
Let your momma have a mammogram
Busting like Sammy Sam
Niggers can’t even see me on the beat
Like a blind pianist at a band exam
But fuck a punch line, fuck a metaphor
Fuck the nigga who say they wasn't feeling me before!
Life is like a movie, I just write the score
Let me dumb it down, maybe you can understand me more!
I got no time for this shot jock, get up above my cock
Put the mic down, you’re looking sixty four!
I’m guessing I’m the nigga that they love to hate
But they still watch a nigga, and they pay attention more!
Closer to my words, and closer you observe
Trying to decipher he flow you niggers know this shit is absurd!
You notice every verb and every adjective and every syllable
And why compared to me there is nobody who’s identical
Instrumental general, grand hustle admirable
I’m balling over here, give a fuck about your interviews
Niggas talk, hoes too, but they know I’m one of the coldest overall and general
The more I ball the more the haters run
When you fuck the game, the problems gonna come
Back down never, I'm never gonna run
Fuck life and get high, that’s what I call overcoming obstacles
Get up off my testicles, I got this under control
I'm calling audibles. I know what I gotta do
When you travel on this road, man after a while
Nobody’s on the either sides of you!
Reaching out to other artist for a wider view
In reality artists just don’t have the time for you
It is what it is, I don’t take it personal
But it’s a jungle out, lions don’t eat vegetables
I mean veggies I’m all about my...
I don’t smoke .. and I’m never on a...
I’m going full speed, but I don’t know where I’m heading
So keep up my yard and never touch my...
I’m on the edge, you should never cross the line
Niggers feel safe when they’re online...
I’m about to show what a hell is...
So let me do this for East Side bitch ... on six!
Call it what you want, but real recognize real
So the ... true niggers don’t even exist!
Ah, grand hustle, it’s B.o.B
It’s free.. not a lot of niggers bet
So now we gonna see what’s up and what’s good
Bobby Ray coming to your neighborhood!
Yeah that’s what’s up, good news
Thanks to madailui

It's been ten long years since
The devil laid his fiddle at Johnny's feet
And it burned inside his mind
The way he suffered that defeat

In the darkest pits of hell
The devil hatched an evil plan
To tempt the fiddle player for
He's just a mortal man

"The sin of pride," the devil
Cried is what will do you in
"I thought we had this settled
I'm the best there's ever been"

Johnny did you ever know
That time keeps marching on?
The coldest hour is the one
Comes just before the dawn

The devil's back in Georgia
Will you stand up to the test
Or will you let the
Devil be the best?
In truth, I haven't played much
Since the baby came in June
But give me half a minute an'
I'll get this fiddle back in tune

The devil grabbed the golden
Fiddle out of Johnny's hand and said
"Though I'm the fiddle player
Underground and I walk upon the land"

Y'all just better be just turnin'
Back if you want this boy to win
'Cos practice is the only cure for
The predicament he's in

Now devil it would be a sin
For you to get my bow
You go on back to hell and to
The wood shed I will go

Johnny are you practicing or
Will your hands grow cold?
The devil walks the land and
Plays a fiddle made of gold

Can you hear the babe a crying
Will he ever know?
The devil wants
His daddy's very soul?
Before we play, I want to thank you
For letting God's own Word ring true
He said, "You can't be trusted
Yes but what you gonna do?"

Well you get your fiddle devil if
You think that you can win
'Cos I beat you once you old dog
And I can whip your butt again

John Brown's green, the devil is red
Mama's little baby loves short-nymph bread
The devil's dream is that he can win
But Johnny is the best that's ever been
It's not worth one night on earth
Baby I know, baby I know
I won't know whose lips you're kissing
Baby I know
You don't know what you have done
Baby I know, baby don't go
You don't know what you are missing
Baby and so

There's not a sacrifice too strong
I've been alone for far too long
I'd be a fool to fail, I follow you
You must believe

Promise the earth
Give her the ocean
A kiss on the wind, goes straight to the heart
Promise the earth
With tears of emotion
If fate is a force that tears you apart
Please believe me, I would sell my soul for you
It's not too late
And we can turn back the time

Baby I know
I lay down with you in dreams
Baby I know, baby don't go
I was driven by this vision
Baby and so
If I could testify to you
Then I could prove my aim is true
If I am guilty or I'm innocent
You must believe

Promise the earth
Give her the ocean
A kiss on the wind, goes straight to the heart (baby believe)
Promise the earth
With tears of emotion
If fate is a force that tears you apart

You know I'm only human, so what am I supposed to say
'Course I'm gonna miss you, and curse the day you went away
What I would surrender, if I could make you turn around
The world we've got together, forever is on solid ground
Oooh, baby don't go
Baby don't go
Baby don't go
Baby
You're part of every dream
Before the dawn
You must believe

Promise the earth
Give her the ocean
A kiss on the wind, goes straight to the heart (make her believe)
Promise the earth
With tears of emotion
If fate is a force that tears you apart

Baby believe
Promise the earth
Give her the ocean
A kiss on the wind, goes straight to the heart
Promise the earth
With tears of emotion
If fate is a force that tears you apart

Baby believe
Promise the earth
Promise the earth
Promise the earth
Promise the earth
You better believe
(It starts with one)
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind; I designed this rhyme
To explain, in due time
All I know (all I know)

Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal (it's so unreal)

Didn't look out below
Watched the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
I wasted it all just to
Watch you go (watch you go)

I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

One thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind; I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard (I tried so hard)

In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised
It got so (got so far)

Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me
In the end (in the end)

You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I got a friend named Whiskey Sam
He was my boonierat buddy for a year in Nam
He said is my country just a little off track
Took 'em twenty-five years to welcome me back
But, it's better than not coming back at all
Many a good man I saw fall
And even now, every time I dream
I hear the men and the monkeys in the jungle scream

Drive on, it don't mean nothin'
My children love me , but they don't understand
And I got a woman who knows her man
Drive on, it don't mean nothin', it don't mean nothin'
Drive on

I remember one night, Tex and me
Rappelled in on a hot L.Z
We had our 16's on rock and roll
But, with all that fire, was scared and cold
We were crazy, we were wild
And I have seen the tiger smile
I spit in a bamboo viper's face
And I'd be dead, but by God's grace
Drive on, it don't mean nothin'
My children love me , but they don't understand
And I got a woman who knows her man
Drive on, it don't mean nothin', it don't mean nothin'
Drive on

It was a real slow walk in a real sad rain
And nobody tried to be John Wayne
I came home, but Tex did not
And I can't talk about the hit he got
I got a little limp now when I walk
And I got a little tremolo when I talk
But my letter read from Whiskey Sam
"You're a walkin' talkin' miracle from Vietnam"

Drive on, it don't mean nothin'
My children love me , but they don't understand
And I got a woman who knows her man
Drive on, it don't mean nothin', it don't mean nothin'
Drive on
Poor you, I'm sorry you're not me, for you will never know what loving you can be
Poor you, you'll never know your charms
You'll never feel your warmth, you're never in your arms
When it is you I'm kissing, I pity you constantly
You don't know what you're missing, 'cause you're only kissing poor me
Poor you, you live your whole life through
And yet you'll never know the thrill of loving you
Woke up this morning, felt around for my shoes
That's when I knew I had them old walking blues
I woke up this morning, felt around, felt around for my shoes
That's when I knew I had them old, mean old walking blues
Leaving in the morning if I have to, robbed blind
I've been mistreated and I don't mind dying
I'm leaving in the morning if I have to, robbed blind
I've been mistreated and I just don't mind dying
She got that Elgin movement from her head down to her toes
Breaking on a dollar 'most anywhere she goes
Well I got a good woman coming my way
Tried to try, some electric pantin', some electric chillin' cryin'
But, ooh, mistook, misgiven
Got me up and walking Baby, but I'm walking blue, walking blue
Well some people say boy, the walking blues ain't bad
It's the worst old feelin' I 'most ever had

[Verse 1]
You're sweet (you're sweet) as a honey bee
But like a honey bee stings
You've gone and left my heart in pain
All you left (all you left) is our favorite song
The one that we danced to all night long
It used to bring (ooh) sweet memories (memories)
Of a tender love that used to be

[Chorus]
Now it's the same old song
But it's a different meaning
Since you been gone
Now It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone

[Verse 2]
Sentimental fool am I
To hear a old love song
And wanna cry
But the melody keeps haunting me
Reminding me how in love we used to be
Keep hearing the part that used to touch our hearts
Stay together forever darlin'
Breaking up never

[Chorus]
Now it's the same old song
Different meaning since you been gone
Now It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone



(Reach out)
Come on, girl
Reach out for me
(Reach out)
Reach out for me baby

Now if you feel like you can't go on
Because all of your hope is gone
And your life is filled with much confusion
Until happiness is just an illusion
And your world around is crumbling down
Well darlin'
(Reach out) Come on, girl, reach out for me
(Reach out) Reach out for me

I'll be there with a love that'll shelter you
I'll be there with a love that'll see you through
When you're feeling lost and about to give up
'Cause your life just ain't good enough
And you feel the world has grown cold
And you're drifting out on your own
And you need somebody's hand to hold, darlin'
(Reach out) Reach out, reach out for me baby
(Reach out) Reach out

I'll be there to love and to comfort you
And I'll be there to cherish and care for you

Oh, and I'll be there to always see you through
And I'll, I'll be there for you, baby, just look over your shoulder, oh...
I like cake, no mistake, but baby if you insist
I'll cut out the cake, just for your sake
Baby! C'mon and knock me a kiss

I like pie, I hope to die, just to get a load of this
When you get high, doggone the pie
Baby! C'mon and knock me a kiss

When you pressed your little lips to mine, that was then I understood
They taste like candy, brandy and wine, peaches, bananas and everything
Good
I love jam and no film flam, scratch that off my list
This ain't no jam, the jam can scram
Baby! C'mon and knock me a kiss

When you pressed your sweet little lips to mine, that was then I understood
They taste like candy, brandy and wine, peaches, bananas and everything
Good
I like cars and big cigars but baby they won't be missed
If everyday I hear you say
Baby! C'mon and knock me a kiss
Baby! C'mon and knock me a kiss
Now the summer's gone
And the winter's coming on
And I wait for you
But I know that you have gone away from me
And I know, yes I know
It's gonna be a lonely winter

Just to walk alone
And leave all the love we've known
Autumn leaves will fall
Wish winter would only call you back to me
And I know, yes I know
It's gonna be a lonely winter

It, I know, could be a very long time
I can't make your love mine
Mine and mine alone
But I know that I can't make you love me
I can't make you want me
Till the winter's gone
Leaves begin to fall
And the trees begin to bare
Then I wait for you
But I know that you're not here
You've gone away
And I know, yes I know
It's gonna be a lonely winter

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind-man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Verse 1]
Been walking all morning went walking all night
I can't see much difference between the dark and light
And I feel the wind And I taste the rain
Never in my mind to cause so much pain

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind-man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Verse 2]
From day to day just letting it ride
You get so far away from how it feels inside
You can't let go cause you're afraid to fall
But the day may come when you can't feel at all

[Verse 3]
The words come out like an angry stream
You hear yourself say things you could never mean
When you cool down you find your mind
You got a lot of words you've got to stand behind

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind-man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill, only love can fill, only love can fill
I know they're gonna run to me
When they get across the sea
Every chance to win when Washington lands in France
All safe for now sugar baby

Oh mama don't you weep and moan
Uncle Sam got your man and gone
Now they're doing that Lindy Bird across the sea

Oh mama how can it be
You went way across the sea
Just to keep from doing that Lindy Bird with me
Oh baby, well, I done told you now

You should have seen me with my uniform on
I could Lindy just as sure as you're born
And then I'd do that Lindy Bird with you

[Guitar solo]

I asked her for a piece of banana
She said, "Let me play the blues on your piano
And then I'll do that Lindy Bird with you"
She said she had a dream about a submarine
Now, I asked her for a glass of k-ola
She said, "Let me play the blues on your Victrola
And then I'll do the Lindy Bird with you"

[Intro:]
Real skills, Bronx styles, Cypress Ave meets Cypress Hill
Real hip-hop, bounce to this shit motherfuckers, READ EM!
You know what's up, SHRAP!
Commissioner Gordon rock on
Tony Touch why'all rock on
Kid Capri yeah rock on
DJ Kenny Coffin yo rock on

[Verse 1:]
In 199-sess, KRS is in his peak-in
You are weak-in and collapse like Mike, collect the beacon
You talk more ish than a cellullar
You can't last, just call me Enema
'cause I give that ass-troid, heaven and mergatroid
I'm that six, umm, microphone-holdin humanoid
Pyschological like Sigmund Freud
But I get annoyed 'cause these rappers have no brain
These hardcore rappers crack me up like cocaine
They got no skill or game
They sellin that commercial let me say it
"Ask for Minoxadil with Rogaine"
True skills I will explain
The teacher breaks this whole shit down plain

[Chorus:]
West Coast beef must dead, no-ho-ho
East Coast beef must dead, no-ho-ho
Time for us to move ahead, no-ho-ho
Be -boy hip-hop is dead, no
We must move ahead (x8)

[Verse 2:]
People always say when they see us, teach us
So we move by the inch, teachin only some of it, believe us
Hustlas and players and hoes will never leave us
They been around since Mary Magdalene and Jesus
Run wit it, pimps and players run the government
We been raised on a tonne of it that's why we're lovin it
Bein a player is cool when you a kid
Until you get sent up for a eight year bid
Now you use and abuse and serve like hell
Til one day you are found face down upon the ground
Two shots to the dome, we need to switch quick
Dyin over what you players, I think, call a bitch
I'm not a player hater 'cause I hate no one
But when you start destroyin hip-hop, you gots ta go, son
Government attack one who's brainwashed
Government attack two who is, yes, brain rinsed
Government attack three is for you and me
To constantly dream about the Lex with bulletproof tints
It's pointless to think I'm knockin ya
If you a pimp, be a pimp, I'll be a philosopher
So the....

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Why-yes are the intelligent, we descend on every establishment
In the East or West, microphone grabbin it
Chess-to-chess, lyrical confrontation is dope
For the hip-hop nation, yet our hope, your scope
Is broader than who can kill who and who got the biggest crew?
That's why black people cannot seem to break through
It's like crabs in a pot when one crab reaches the top
Other crabs wish to pull down and blood (BLOODS)
I'm not understandin what's all the fuss
Hip-hop belongs to all of us
The East created it, the West decorated it
Learn the lesson, the unified picture is black expression
When black expression heights itself
It becomes black digression leadin to depression in health
Now question these ideas today
If hip-hop was destroyed could we blame the CIA
Or the FBI, you'd be a motherfuckin lie-
-er, li-are, pants on fire-er
Conspiracy theories are contrise or we keep them on the shelf
We got no one to blame but ourselves
So....

[Chorus]
We must move ahead (x8)
All beef is dead!

She's got an american accent
From her head to her toes
If she's involved in an accident
You wouldn't see her underclothes
She is perfectly spotless
A fact that sticks out a mile
But people have got more talent
But this little lady's got style
Style, style
See her when she's walking
She's got style, style
Even when she's making me say
Ooooh-oo
Ooooh hey hey
Ooooh
She was born on the wrong side
Of these imaginary tracks
That used to divide each other
Into two convenient packs
She became a survivor
Always armed with a smile
You've only have to look at her picture to know
That this little lady's got style
Style, style
See her when she's talking
Style, style
Even when she's staying her place
As an only child
In a hostile world
Her only chance
Was to run away
Yeah yeah woh
Ooh
She's got style, style
See her when she's walking
She's got style, woh, style
Even when she's talking away
Oh style, yeah, style
I see her when she's talking
She's got style, style
Even when she's staying her place
Oooh, way
Ooh, oh, yeah, ooh, ooh, yeah
Stuck in a maze, a labyrinth of hate. Shattered doors in
A mask of haze. Struggling madly in a cage. Desperately
Searching for a way out of the maze. Running blindly not
Feeling the floor, nothing to stand on we fall. Lost in
The halls, I'm looking for the doors. Confusion! My
Senses are dying. My soul is crying. Let me out, let me
Out! I'm screaming! Running blindly through the visions
Barefoot and defenseless. Running blindly through the
Dark, infested woods. Time and time again. Disillusion
I'm deeper in the maze. Further from the light. I scream
Out of the confusion. I'm being consumed by confusion. My

World has been shattered. Crippled. All we have left is
Fragments of doors. Though we once had but never had
We've all been fooled. Confusion. My senses are dying my
Soul is crying. Let me out. Let me out. I'm screaming
I'm living in a demented labyrinth. tortured. Lost
Crippled. I'm a part of this confusion. Shattered
Confusion. Shattered vision. All that I have left is
Illusion. I'm screaming at the confusion. I'm being
Consumed by confusion. In an abstract, in a world of
Confusion!

(Woo!)
I've been around the world, and back
Seen a little bit of everything

And if the price is right, I mean the night is right, I mean the time is right
So do her thing, and I know the price, night, and time is right
So dimelo mami, don't play no games

Before I go, I'd like to say a few things. This album was completed on January 15th 1991
By now, the war has probably started and a whole bunch of people have probably died out there in the desert over some bullshit
There's a war goin' on right now in my neighborhood, but I can't really determine which one is worse
I think the one that we are all fightin' is fucked up, and that's the war inside our brains, you know?
But, uh, I feel bad about all the brothers and sisters gettin' pulled right out of their neighborhoods, all the cities, and small towns in America that go over there and fight for that bullshit That most of them don't really have anything to do with, so I gotta send peace out to 'em
Also peace out to all my homies in jail, brothers that are dead locked up right here on earth. Talkin' about the brothers in Soledad, San Quentin, all the way up to Pelicans' Bay, Tracy, Chino, and all my homeboys out there in the east coast lockdown facilities. I'm talkin' about Clinton, Rikers, Joliet, you know every prison in the whole fuckin' world man, that's like, you know, all bullshit, you know?
They say slavery has been abolished except for the convicted felon; y'all need to think about that. That lets you know what the fuckin' Constitution is really about, you know?
A lot of my homeboys have been locked down my whole entire career, and thats some bullshit
So for them from the Rhyme Syndicate and Ice-T, I'd like to send this special shout out: Fuck the police, fuck the FBI, fuck the DEA, fuck the CIA, fuck Tipper Gore, Bush and his cripple bitch! This is Ice-T, I'm out of here. Told ya you shoulda killed me last year!
When you're alone and life is making you lonely
You can always go - downtown
When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry
Seems to help, I know - downtown
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty
How can you lose?

The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
So go downtown, things'll be great when you're
Downtown - no finer place, for sure
Downtown - everything's waiting for you

Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows - downtown
Maybe you know some little places to go to
Where they never close - downtown
Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova
You'll be dancing with him too before the night is over
Happy again
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
So go downtown, where all the lights are bright
Downtown - waiting for you tonight
Downtown - you're gonna be all right now

(instrumental)
And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
Guide them along

So maybe I'll see you there
We can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares
So go downtown, things'll be great when you're
Downtown - don't wait a minute for
Downtown - everything's waiting for you
Downtown, downtown, downtown, downtown ...

[Intro: Dennis Edwards]
Well
Get down
Nah nah
Hi yah hi hi hi
Ahh yah ha

[Verse 1: Dennis Edwards & (The Temptations)]
Hey (Let your hair down) Oh, doctor and lawyer
(Get up...) And let your reputation sit a while
Hey hey (Let your hair down)
Hey, Mister Businessman (Let it down)
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
Hey Mister Businessman you're always on the go
You've made your fortune
Yet you're working harder than ever before
All those pills you're taking daily will never see you through
Cause none of them are prescribed for what's really ailing you (Let it down)
It don't take no doctor long to see what you got, well
Your life has turned into one great big knot
Hey yay hey now
(Let your hair down)
Can you let it down?
Let it down, let it down, awww
(Get up...) And let your reputation sit a while
Hey (Let your hair down)
Don't ever be ashamed of what you're doin' (Let it down)
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy - Hey hey hey

[Bridge: Dennis Edwards & (The Temptations)]
How do you do, Miss Saditty?
Uptight - You look such a pity
I've got some advice for you
Take this record in your room
Lock the door, and get some groove
Let it down (Let it down)
Let your hair down (Let it down)
Ayy hey
(Let it down, Let it down, let it all the way down)
All you got to do is let the music take your mind
Show your partners
Anything they can do, you can do better
(Anything they can do, you can do better) Well, well, well, well
This is the part of the song where the horns take the throne
Down (blow) dih down down hey

[Outro: Dennis Edwards & (The Temptations)]
Let it down, let it down - hey
Let it down, let it down - hey
Let it down, let it down
Hey, let it down
Let your hair down
Hey, doctors and lawyers
(Get up) And let your reputation sit a while
Hey hey (Let your hair down)
Hey, Mister Businessman (Let it down)
Don't you know - all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
Hey hey hey (Let your hair down)
Let it down, let it down, let it down, let it down
(Get up) And let your reputation sit a while - do it, hey
Whilst his mother's womb contained the growing Baal
Even then the sky was waiting quiet and pale
Naked, young, immensely marvellous
Like Baal loved it, when he came to us

That same sky remained with him in joy and care
Even when Baal slept peaceful and unaware
At night a lilac sky, a drunken Baal
Turning pious as the sky grows pale

So through hospital, cathedral, whiskey bar
Baal kept moving onwards and just let things go
When Baal's tired, boys, Baal cannot fall far
He will have his sky down there below

When the sinners congregate in shame together
Baal lay naked, revelling in their distress
Only sky, a sky that will go on forever
Formed a blanket for his nakedness

And that lusty girl, the world, who'll laughing yield
To the men who'll stand the pressure of her thighs
Sometimes gave him love-bites, such as can't be healed
Baal survived it, he just used his eyes
And when Baal saw lots of corpses scattered round
He felt twice the thrill, despite the lack of room
"Space enough" said Baal, "then I'll thicken the ground
Space enough within this woman's womb"

Any vice for Baal has got its useful side
It's the man who practices it, he can't abide
Vices have their point, once you see it as such
Stick to two for one will be too much

Slackness, softness are the sort of things to shun
Nothing could be harder than the quest for fun
Lots of strength is needed and experience too
Swollen bellies can embarrass you

Under gloomy stars and this poor veil of tears
Baal will graze a pasture till it disappears
Once it's been digested to the forest's teeth
Baal trod singing for a well earned sleep

Baal can spot the vultures in the stormy sky
As they wait up there to see if Baal will die
Sometimes Baal pretends he's dead, but vultures swoop
Baal in silence dines on vulture-soup

When the dark womb drags him down to its prize
What's the world still mean to Baal, he's overfed
So much sky is lurking still behind his eyes
He'll just have enough sky when he's dead
Once the Earth's dark womb engulfed the rotting Baal
Even then the sky was up there, quiet and pale
Naked, young, immensely marvellous
Like Baal loved it when he lived with us
Day-o, day-o
Daylight come and me wan' go home
Day, me say day, me say day, me say day
Me say day, me say day-o
Daylight come and me wan' go home
Work all night on a drink a rum
Daylight come and me wan' go home
Stack banana till the mornin' come
Daylight come and me wan' go home
Come, Mister tally man, tally me banana
Daylight come and me wan' go home
Come, Mister tally man, tally me banana
Daylight come and me wan' go home
Lift six foot, seven foot, eight foot bunch
Daylight come and me wan' go home
Six foot, seven foot, eight foot bunch
Daylight come and me wan' go home
Day, me say day-o
Daylight come and me wan' go home
Day, me say day, me say day, me say day, me say day, me say day
(Daylight come and me wan' go home)
A beautiful bunch, a ripe banana
(Daylight come and me wan' go home)
Hide the deadly, black tarantula
(Daylight come and me wan' go home)
Lift six foot, seven foot, eight foot bunch
Daylight come and me wan' go home
Six foot, seven foot, eight foot bunch
Daylight come and me wan' go home
Day, me say day-o
Daylight come and me wan' go home
Day, me say day, me say day, me say day, me say day, me say day
(Daylight come and me wan' go home)
Come, Mister tally man, tally me banana
Daylight come and me wan' go home
Come, Mister tally man, tally me banana
Daylight come and me wan' go home
Day-o, day-o
Daylight come and me wan' go home
Day, me say day, me say day, me say day, me say day, me say day-o
Daylight come and me wan' go home

[DMX]
Uh-huh (Y'KNOW?)
..
ARF!
Uhh..

Take it for what it's worth, my birth was a blessing
Sent to live and die, on earth as a lesson
We each have a star, all we have to do is find it
Once you do, everyone who sees it will be blinded (WHAT?)
They'll tell you that you're bright, and say you have a future
When you turn your back, same cats'll try to shoot ya
Niggas ain't shit, I can live on both sides of the fence
Forget what you do, when you talk, see what you really meant (aight?)
That's what I thought, them niggas was bluffin (uh)
They talk all day but say, nothin (uh)
It gets so dark (WHAT?) haze so intense
Since this first rain it's like it's rained ever since (WHAT?)
Never got paid for a rhyme but I flow (whoo)
Never got a plate on time but I grow (whoo)
Nigga life STAY on the line but I go (UHH)
Went from doin crime to bein kind cause I know
I'm gon' live forever, I'm never gon' die
Only thing I fear is that I'm never gon' fly
Carry my weight but I'm never gon' cry
Shit I tell y'all niggas straight cause I'm never gon' lie

I'm gon' live forever, I'm never gon' die
Only thing I fear is that I'm never gon' fly
Carry my weight but I'm never gon' cry
Shit I tell y'all niggas straight cause I'm never gon' lie

What is about who I am that makes me unforgettable (HMM)
What it is about what I've done that makes it so incredible (uhh)
"More money, more problems" -- well the fame was worse (uh-huh)
I reached out for love and what came back was thirst (WHAT?)
Blessed with the curse (uh) niggas don't hear me
Niggas don't hear me, Y'ALL NIGGAZ, don't hear me (uh)
What'd I just say? "Nigga g'head" - you see that?
You gots to FEEL ME to catch what I'm sayin, BELIEVE THAT (UHH!)
But leave that, alone (WHAT?)
We gon' make a nigga wanna be at, your home (WHAT?)
Oh you kinda quiet with the heat at, your dome (UHH!)
If the dog got he's gonna bring back a bone
Cause we got the chrome (C'MON!)
This is what I live for, or die for
I'm the nigga with the high score, you try for
What you niggas wanna lie for? It changes nothin
I'm true for cats, yet some strangers bluffin
I'm gon' live forever, I'm never gon' die
Only thing I fear is that I'm never gon' fly
Carry my weight but I'm never gon' cry
Shit I tell y'all niggas straight cause I'm never gon' lie

Now if I take what he gave me and I, use it right (uh-huh)
In other words if I listen and, use the light (uh-huh)
Then what I say will remain here, after I'm gone
Still here, on the strength of a song, I live on (HMM)
No second-guessin on what I stood for, I was good for
Stoppin niggas from killin each other in the hood war (UHH)
Comin through showin love, throwin up (UHH)
Them cats not throwin love, you know whassup (WHAT?)
Dark Man baby, that's my name
And I gots to be the realest nigga (UHH) up in this game
Cause ain't no shame, they don't make em like, this no more
Real to the core, big heart but built for war
I stand for what I believe in
Even if what I believe in stops me from breathin
Relatives grievin, but I ain't went nowhere
Listen to the song (C'MON) I'm right there

I'm gon' live forever, I'm never gon' die
Only thing I fear is that I'm never gon' fly
Carry my weight but I'm never gon' cry
Shit I tell y'all niggas straight cause I'm never gon' lie
Where is the sun
That shone
On my head
The sun in my life
It is dead
It is dead
Where is the light
That would play
In my streets
And where are the friends
I could meet
I could meet
Where are the girls
I left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind
Where are the girls
I left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind
Where is the girl
Where is the girl
I loved all along
The girl that I loved
She's gone
She's gone
All of my life
I call yesterday
The spicks and the specks
Of my life've gone away
All of my life
I call yesterday
The spicks and the specks
Of my life've gone away
Everybody
Spicks and specks
Spicks and specks, yeah
Ahh, spicks and specks
I've had my moments, I will confess
My fleeting moments of tenderness
I sang of true love, I've played guitars
Then found a new love 'neath tropical stars
This time's the last time, this time it's new
Love as a pastime for me is through
I've had my moments, my big bad moments
But now my one big moment is you

I sang of true love, and I've played guitars
Then found a new love 'neath tropical stars
This time's the last time, this time it's new
Love as a pastime for me is through
I've had my moments, my big bad moments
But now my one big moment is you
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where it starts﻿
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
And I don't have any plans
I wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is a prize
So wake﻿ me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost

[Intro]
Let me love you 'til I overdose
Woohoo, woohoo

[Verse 1]
The time we spent plays in my head like a record
You got me up, I put it down, it gets better
I tried a million nights to sleep, it was too hard, too hard (uh, yeah)
Your body’s banging, like 808’s and hammers knocking
I wake up saying I need you, baby, I was lost when
You tried to tell me I was fine, right from the start, the start

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you got the room spinning
I don’t wanna lose this feeling (yeah)
Girl, you get me high, you know just what I like
And I want some more (oh), I want some more (oh)

[Chorus]
So let me overdose (overdose)
'Cause I’m feining for your touch
Let me overdose (overdose)
'Cause baby, I can’t get enough
Let me overdose
It’s so good
But your love is just too much
Your love is just too much
Let me love you 'til I overdose
Let me love you 'til I overdose
Let me love you 'til I overdose

[Verse 2]
My life’s a mess, but no regrets, you are really
My favorite drug, I need a fix, can you help me?
I tried a million night to quit, it was too hard, too hard, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you got the room spinning (the room spinning)
I don’t wanna lose this feeling (yeah) (no, no, yeah)
Girl, you get me high, you know just what I like
And I want some more (oh), I want some more (oh) (so let me)

[Chorus]
So let me overdose (overdose)
'Cause I’m feining for your touch
Let me overdose (overdose)
'Cause baby, I can’t get enough
Let me overdose
It’s so good
But your love is just too much
Your love is just too much

[Bridge]
Ain’t no rehab
Gon' take what we have (we have)
'Cause what we have (we have)

Ain’t no rehab
Gon' take what we have (we have)
'Cause what we have (we have)

[Chorus]
So let me overdose (overdose)
'Cause I’m feining for your touch, yeah, baby
Let me overdose (overdose)
'Cause baby, I can’t get enough (woohoo)
Let me overdose
It’s so good
But your love is just too much (it's too much)
Your love is just too much (too much)
Let me love you 'til I overdose, yeah
Let me love you 'til I overdose ('til I, 'til I)
Let me love you 'til I overdose

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning
With the burning of love hanging over my head
As I walked into the living room
Sit with you
Discuss what's going on

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it me?
Is it you?
Is it something I forgot to do?
Oh, tell me so that I understand

[Chorus]
I just need some time
Gather all my thoughts
To make up for the love I just lost
You've been so good to me
Given me everything
Take what you want 'cause it doesn't belong to me

[Verse 2]
I woke up this morning with a hurting
That I would never ever wish upon
Even my worst enemy
Who is she?
What the hell do you people want?

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it me?
Is it you?
Is it something I forgot to do?
Oh, tell me so that I understand

[Chorus 2]
Oh, I just need some time
Gather all my thoughts
To make up for the love I just lost
You've been so good to me
Given me everything
Take what you want 'cause it doesn't belong to me anyway

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Hey, hey
Oh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah'
Oh

[Chorus]
I just need some time
Gather all my thoughts
To make up for the love I just lost
You've been so good to me
Given me everything
Take what you want 'cause it doesn't belong to me
I just need some time
Gather all my thoughts
To make up for the love I just lost
You've been so good to me
Given me everything
Take what you want 'cause it doesn't belong to me
Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things don't seem the same
Actin' funny, but I don't know why
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky

Purple haze all around
Don't know if I'm comin' up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me

Help me
Help me
Oh, no, no

Hammerin'
Talkin' 'bout heart 'n' s-soul
I'm talkin' about hard stuff
If everybody's still around, fluff and ease, if
So far out my mind
Something's happening, something's happening
Ooo, ahhh
Ooo, ahhh
Ooo, ahhh
Ooo, ahhh, yeah!

Purple haze all in my eyes, uhh
Don't know if it's day or night
You got me blowin', blowin' my mind
Is it tomorrow or just the end of time?

Ooh
Help me
Ahh, yea-yeah, purple haze, yeah
Oh, no, oh
Oh, help me
Tell me, baby, tell me
I can't go on like this
You're makin' me blow my mind, mama
N-no, nooo
No, it's painful, baby
You won't listen to nothing I tell you, baby
You keep on doing just as you please
Hey, you won't do nothing I tell you, baby
Keep on doing as you please
I've taken as long as I can, baby
When is this foolishness gonna cease

I've worried myself crazy, baby
Cried both night and day
I said I've worried myself crazy, baby
Cried both night and day
You don't believe me, baby
But I'm gonna leave one of these days

Well, you told me that you love me
But actions speak louder than words
Oh, you said you love me, baby
But action speaks louder than words
I won't be fooled no longer, baby
That line everybody's heard
Well, If you're gonna change, baby
You better do it real soon
Hey, If you're gonna change
For the better, baby
You better do it real soon
Because you'll wake up one of these mornings
Find yourself in a empty room
She's a real heartbreaker, don't you know?
Oh, real heartbreaker, don't you know?
She's a real heartbreaker, mean man hater
She's a real heartbreaker, don't you know?
When she holds my hand I get warm inside
Something happened that I can't describe
She never talk serious 'bout love or romance
She's the kinda babe that won't give your heart a chance

A real heartbreaker, don't you know?
She's a real heartbreaker, don't you know?
She's a real heartbreaker, mean man hater
She's a real heartbreaker, don't you know?

No one man ever enters her mind
She loves to flirt with maybe eight or nine
When she goes out, man, she has a ball
She don't date one, she'd love to date them all

She's a real heartbreaker, don't you know?
She's real heartbreaker, don't you know?
A real heartbreaker, mean man hater
She's a real heartbreaker, don't you know?
Well, no one man ever enters her mind
She loves to flirt with maybe eight or nine
She made up her mind, man, to really live
She gonna go out and live for real

She's a mean manhater, don't you know?
She's a real heartbreaker, don't you know?
She's a real heartbreaker, a mean man hater
She's a real heartbreaker, don't you know?

A real heartbreaker, a real heartbreaker
A mean man hater, a real heartbreaker
Each time I look into your eyes
I see that there, there heaven lies
And as I look
I see the love of the loved

Someday they'll see that from the start
My place has been deep in your heart
And in your heart
I see the love of the loved

Though I said it all before
I will say it more and more
Now that I'm really sure
You love me

And I know that from today
I'll see it in the way
That you look at me
And say ah you love me

So let it rain, I'll never care
Deep in your heart, I'll still be there
And when I'm there
I see the love of the loved
Though I said it all before
I will say it more and more
Now that I'm really sure
You love me

And I know that from today
I'll see it in the way
That you look at me
And say ah you love me

So let it rain, I'll never I care
Deep in your heart, I'd still be there
And when I'm there

If you don't want me baby, mama you sure don't got to stall
If you don't want me baby, mama you sure don't got to stall
I've had more pretty women than a passenger train could haul

I'm gonna buy myself a shotgun, one with a long shiny barrel
I'm gonna buy myself a shotgun, one with a long shiny barrel
I'm gonna shoot me a rounder oh that stole away my gal

I'd rather drink your muddy water, sleep down in a hollow log

Than to be in Atlanta, Georgia, treat me like a dirty dog
(I don't have to go for that)

If you don't want me baby, mama you sure don't got to stall
If you don't want me baby, mama you sure don't got to stall
'Cause I've had more pretty women than a passenger train could haul

Than to be in Atlanta, Georgia, treated like a dirty dog

Oh Give me a T for Texas, give me a T for Tennessee

Well they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me

Everybody's trying to be my baby

Everybody's trying to be my baby, now

Well half past nine, half past four
Fifty women knocking on my door

Everybody's trying to be my baby

Let us put men and women together
See which one is smarter
Some say men, but I say no
Women run the men like a puppet show
It ain't me
It's the people that say
Men are leading the women astray
But I say, it's the women today
Smarter than the man in every way

Chorus:
That's right
The women are smarter
That's right
The women are smarter
That's right
The women are smarter
The women are smarter
That's right
Little boy sit on the corner and cry
Big man come and he asked him why
He said, "I can't do what the big boys do"
The man sat down and he cried too
It ain't me
It's the people that say
Men are leading the women astray
But I say, it's the women today
Smarter than the man in every way
Chorus:
That's right
The women are smarter
That's right
The women are smarter
That's right
The women are smarter
The women are smarter
That's right, that's right
Ever since the world began
Women been banned from the ways of man
Listen boy 'cause I've got a plan
Give it up, don't try and understand
It ain't me
It's the people that say
Men are leading the women astray
But I say, it's the women today
Smarter than the man in every way

Chorus:
That's right
The women are smarter
That's right
The women are smarter
That's right
The women are smarter
The women are smarter
That's right
Let us put men and women together
See which one is smarter
Some say men, but I say no
Women run the men like a puppet show
It ain't me
It's the people that say
Men are leading the women astray
But I say, it's the women today
Smarter than the man in every way
Chorus:
That's right
The women are smarter
That's right
The women are smarter
That's right
The women are smarter
The women are smarter
That's right, that's right
Repeat chorus and fade out
Yeah
This is goin out to all those muthafuckas
That like to use the word 'gangster'
Although I am the O.G
I'm representin that hustlin game
To the end, nigga
I'm tryin to make the loot loop

[ VERSE 1 ]
I ain't no muthafuckin gangsta, wish you'd quit callin me that
Although I still pack straps I roll in Benzes and Lacs
Best believe the gats in my promo shots ain't props
I hang out sunroof tops and pop Glocks at cops
(Yo, how ya livin?) On the mellow, coolin with my fellow
Hustlers, players, super bitch-layers
Mackaronies on the true d-l - hell, most
Fuckin with my niggas you could end up ghost
I made a million, got my shit out pawned
Bailed out the homies, now the shit's back on
Moved out the ghetto, cause I hate it
But I roll through your fuckin hood and regulate it
Cause I wasn't born to be broke, I let the .45th smoke
Before I let my baby boy go under, no wonder
I'm addicted to the cash flow, stacks of green
Flashback, I'm nudgin weights down a triple beam
I'ma make the loot loop

[ Chorus ]
As fast as I spend it
I'm tryin to get back in it
I make the loot loop
It's cop and blow
Nigga, that's all I know
I make the loot loop
As fast as I spend it
I'm tryin to get back in it
I make my loot loop
Nigga
I'm tryin to make my bank roll bigger

[ VERSE 2 ]
I must admit, I got a lust for loot, quick to shoot
Ostrich, fruits and Austin Martin coupes
Fill my dreams with cream, I got wet sheets
I'm bustin nuts over currency, kid, fuck freaks
We be the niggas in the back of the club with the Moët
Bitches, shrimps, mackin like pimps
Wearin fly shit you never seen before (raw)
I turn a angel to a whore, now need I say more?
My perm got bounce, fuck a 40 ounce
I'm sippin Cristal, pal, and represent I shall
To the end of the game
(That nigga Ice got fame)
And just not over these beats
But on the 4-wheel streets
I make the loot loop

[ Chorus ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Say what you will, I'm the fool on the hill
With the pool, jaccuzzi, laser-beam Uzi
Niggas in LA know the Ice don't play
I'm just a savage for the cabbage and a pimp parlay
I rock a million with the jewels on the paw (don't start)
Cause my niggas ain't the big ones, just big guns
Pushin the limits of this game till I gets my piece
I put my true queen Darlene in a white Corniece
So stay broke if you wanna, hang out on your corner
Step back from the curb when we roll up on ya
20 black cars all tinted, we meant it
'Syndicate forever - posse of the clever'
Rubberbands strap the fat green knots
We're strictly hustlers not gangsters, but we still lick shots
For the goal
Peace, I'm out like Nicole

(Get down
Get down)

Nigga
The bank's getting bigger
Yeah
I'm makin the loot loop
Straight player for life
Yeah
Hustler's side

[Intro]

Girl, gauranteed I'll impress you
Have your body goin' "Ooh, ahh, Kelly, don't stop"
Baby girl, come with me

[Chorus]
Why won't you make up your mind?
Give me a sign
Why won't you make up your mind?

Am I wasting my time living in my head?
You'll be sorry when I make up mine instead

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Why won't you make up your mind?

Am I wasting my time living in my head?
You'll be sorry when I make up mine instead

I wanna make you moan

Not a one night stand

Let my inspiration flow in token rhyme, suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake you, till my tale is told and done
While the firelight's aglow, strange shadows from the flames will grow
Till things we've never seen will seem familiar

Shadows of a sailor, forming winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady many years ago
Here beside him stands a man, a soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights, but lost at love

While the story teller speaks, a door within the fire creaks;
Suddenly flies open, and a girl is standing there
Eyes alight, with glowing hair, all that fancy paints as fair
She takes her fan and throws it, in the lion's den

Which of you to gain me, tell, will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you if you will not take the chance
The sailor gave at least a try, the soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength, and not disaster

The sailor, coming out again, the lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today. You decide if he was wise
The story teller makes no choice. Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light, and not to master
Since the end is never told, we pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will return, but he cannot be bought or sold

Terrapin Station

Inspiration, move me brightly. Light the song with sense and color;
Hold away despair, more than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast, statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb, to get to Terrapin

Counting stars by candlelight, all are dim but one is bright;
The spiral light of Venus, rising first and shining best
On, from the northwest corner, of a brand new crescent moon
While crickets and cicadas sing, a rare and different tune
Terrapin Station

In the shadow of the moon, Terrapin Station
And I know we'll get there soon, Terrapin Station
I can't figure out, Terrapin, if it's the end or beginning, Terrapin
But the train's put it's brakes on, Terrapin
And the whistle is screaming, TERRAPIN

Terrapin Station - At the Siding

While you were gone, these faces filled with darkness
The obvious was hidden. With nothing to believe in
The compass always points to Terrapin
Sullen wings of fortune beat like rain
You're back in Terrapin for good or ill again, for good or ill again
I see them dancing somewhere in the moonlight
Somewhere in Alaska, somewhere in the sun
I hear them singing a song for all lovers
A song for the two hearts beating only as one

Imagine the morning no longer alone
The arms of another, a place to belong
No longer the struggle, no longer the night
And ever becoming in the quickening light

To see the darkness, to listen within
To answer in kindness, to ever begin
To ever be gentle, to always be strong
To walk in the wonder, to live in the song

In a place of enchantment where the wild things are known
Will the future remember when the lovers are gone?

And I see them dancing somewhere in the moonlight
Somewhere in Alaska, somewhere in the sun
I hear them singing a song for all lovers
A song for the two hearts beating only as one
A song for the two hearts beating only as one
I'm a drifter, a lonesome drifter
I got no place to call my home no more
I'm a wanderer, a lonesome wanderer
Got no one to call my own no more

Got no strings to tie me down
Got no cause to hang around
What difference does it make which way I go
Got an empty feelin' deep inside
Still I need to stay alive
And who can tell what waits beyond this road

I'm a drifter, a lonesome drifter
Got no one to call my own no more

Got no strings to tie me down
Got no cause to hang around
What difference does it make which way I go
Got an empty feelin' deep inside
Still I need to stay alive
And who can tell what waits me beyond this road
I'm a drifter, a lonesome drifter
Got no one to call my own no more
Got no one to call my own no more
When I try to sing you say I'm off key
Why can't you see how much this hurts me
With your perfect beauty and your perfect pitch
You're a perfect terror
When I come around, must you always put me down

If you say my singing is off key my love
You will hurt my feelings don't you see my love
I wish I had an ear like yours
A voice that would behave
But all I have is feelings and a voice gone deaf

You insist my music goes against the rules
But rules were never made for lovesick fools
I wrote this little song for you but you don't care
It's a crooked song oh but all my love is there

The thing that you would see if you would play your part
Is even if I'm out of tune I have a gentle heart
I took your picture with my trusty Rollaflex
And now all I have developed is a complex
Possibly in vain I hope you weaken oh my love
And forget these rigid rules that undermine my dream of
A life of love and music with someone who'll understand
That even though I may be out of tune
When I attempt to say how much I love you
All that matters is the message that I bring
Which is my dear one I love you
Wait a minute baby
Stay with me awhile
Said you'd give me light
But you never told me about the fire

Drowning, in the sea of love
Where everyone would love to drown
But now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
When you build your house
Then call me home

(Oooh)

And he was just like, a great dark wing
Within the wings of a storm
I think I have met my match
He was singing
And undoing
And undoing
The laces
Undoing the laces
In the sea of love
Where everyone would love to drown
But now it's gone
They say it doesn't matter anymore
If you build your house
Then please call me home
Sara, your the poet in my heart
Never change
And don't you ever stop
But now it's gone
No, it doesn't matter anymore
When you build your house
I'll come by

Ooh, Sara, ooh, Sara
Never really drown
Would you swallow all your pride
All I ever wanted)
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
For my Lord, for my Lord

It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
For my Lord, for my Lord

If I was a liar
I tell you what I would do
I'd quit my lying
And work on a building too

If I was a drunkard
I tell you what I would do
I'd quit my drinking
And work on a building too

If I was a gambler
I tell you what I would do
I'd quit my gambling
And work on a building too
If I was a preacher
I tell you what I would do
I would keep on preaching
And work on a building too
Confuse forms, unleashing of passions
Confuse forms, by means of inversion
Emotions carried to the extremes
Orgiastic of chaos of supreme

Has to bring the world's dissolution
In a momentary disruption
Although the moment seems definitive
The urge to escape from time into pre-time

Opposites in juxtaposition
While the orgy lasts ultimate fulfilment
Timelessness of eternal moment
The beginning, the end transmutation

Has to bring the world's dissolution
In a momentary disruption
Although the moment seems definitive
The urge to escape from time into pre-time

And all the single women here are fine

Chillin' at the house on the hill
We gotta sing my my my like Johnny Gill
Rich girl, poor girl get the same respect
You can all drink for free and call Earl collect
At the moment of truth with burden of proof
We stacks the stuff and spread love like it's used
The lyrical genius and R&B messiah
And the roof, the roof, we sets on fire
But as long as the party is jumping, we ain't concerned
We don't need no water let the motherfucker burn
And everybody knew somebody who was there
With they hands in the air bringing in the new year, yeah ay yo, come on

Nuggets on the wrist, it's just the shine
'Cause ain't nobody checkin' out the time
Cash and clothes for days to blow your mind
Maybe it's all good so there's tonight
All we want is a party a reason to celebrate
Now that we got the money we dance the night away
Nothing but the hands up

Hands in the air

[get 'em up y'all], drinks everywhere, party in the hills
Keepin' it real, guests from out of town, ladies all around

How could you?
You are the river
Pour out of this life

[Chorus]
How could you?
You are the morning bird
Who sang me into life every day
Fly away

[Verse 2]
You are the blood of me
The harvest of my dreams
There's nowhere I can find peace
And the silence won't cease

[Bridge]
Nothing's quite how it seems
The ghost of my joy
Won't let me be

[Outro]
If you set me free, I will not run
I will not run
I will not run
Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn't get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R

Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R

Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my mind
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R

Show me round your snow peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear your balalaika's ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R
Oh, you're on the top now, baby, but don't nothing stay the same
I said you're up on the top now, baby, but don't nothing stay the same
Every once in a while, baby, lady Luck deals another hand

Are you calling me your pal now, baby, when I used to be your man
Are you calling me your pal now, when I used to be your man
You're flying real high now, baby, go on and raise your sand

Oh, you're up on the top now, baby, but don't nothing stay the same
I said you're up on the top now, baby, but don't nothing stay the same
Every once in a while, lady Luck deals another hand

Oh, I realize now, baby, your kind of love wasn't true
Oh, I realize now, baby, your kind of love won't do
What could have been, baby, hey, now has done fell through
Have you ever wanted someone
And you thought they didn't want you
Have you ever, ever wanted someone
And you thought they didn't want you
You know what you wanted
To say to them, people
But you were afraid she may walk away

Someone like you, baby
Someone like you I ain't never had
Oh someone, someone like you
Someone like you I ain't never had
Maybe I'm asking too much, baby
Oh but I want you, I want you so bad

Oh you look so good to me, baby
Baby, I just got to let you know
Yeah, you look so good
So good to me, baby
I just got to let you know
I wanna keep you forever, baby
I don't wanna ever let you go
So whatever you do, baby
Please leave me a way
To get in touch with you
Oh whatever, ever you do, baby
Please leave me a way
To get in touch with you
I need you so bad, baby
When you leave I'll be so sad
There's something old and something new
And something borrowed, something blue
Packed in her suitcase
I never thought that she would be
A blushing bride but, golly gee
Just look in her suitcase
When I asked her if she'd hurry up and answer
She didn't tell me, she let me guess
So here we go to Buffalo or maybe Maine or Kokomo
Here comes the bride, she said yes

When I asked her if she'd hurry up and please answer
She didn't tell me, she let me guess
So here we go to Buffalo or maybe Maine or Kokomo
Here comes the bride, she didn't say maybe
Here comes the bride, she said yes
I keep hearin' your concern about my happiness
All that thought you've given me is conscience I guess
If I were walkin' in your shoes, I wouldn't worry none
While you and your friends are worryin' 'bout me
I'm havin' lots of fun
Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me, I've nothin' to do
Last night I dressed in tails, pretended I was on the town
As long as I can dream it's hard to slow this swinger down
So please don't give a thought to me, I'm really doin' fine
You can always find me here and havin' quite a time
Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me, I've nothin' to do
It's good to see you, I must go, I know I look a fright
Anyway, my eyes are not accustomed to this light
And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete
So I must go back to my room and make my day complete
Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me, I've nothin' to do
Don't tell me, I've nothin' to do
'Twas on the Isle of Capri that I found her
Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree
Oh, I can still see the flowers bloomin' 'round her
Where we met on the Isle of Capri

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri

Summertime was nearly over
Blue Italian sky above
I said "Lady, I'm a rover
Can you spare a sweet word o'love?"

She whispered softly "It's best not to linger"
And then as I kissed her hand I could see
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger
'Twas goodbye at the Villa Capri

Instrumental-horns with mandolin
Summertime was nearly over
Blue Italian sky above
I said "Lady, I'm a rover
Can you spare a fine word o'love?"

She whispered softly "It's best not to linger"
And then as I kissed her hand I could see
She wore a plain golden ring on her finger
'Twas goodbye on the Isle of Capri
'Twas goodbye on the Isle of Capri
'Twas goodbye on the Isle of Capri
You go in that team
I go on this team
Divide everything
A flag or a number
Make 'em opposites
So there's a reason
Stigmatization
Okay, now we can fight
Divide everything
Just put it all flat
Justification
Don't think now, you just fight
You go in that team
I go on this team
Divide everything
A flag or a number

Divide everything
Just put it all flat
Justification
Don't think now, you just fight
Make 'em opposites
So there's a reason
Stigmatization
Okay, now we can fight
You go in that team
I go on this team
Divide everything
A flag or a number

It is correct
It is correct
It is correct
And reasonable
Well there's a fire up the road burning about five foot three
I feel the heat all the way down here so she's getting to me

It's coming on strong like a beautiful bolt from the blue
She puts the heat in my Havana the bee in my boogaloo

(Call that love)
I call it lighting up the grid
(Call that love)
I call it blowing off the lid
(Call that love)
I call it brimstone lightning
Soul uptightening
Cos that's what it is

It's like you don't know what it is till you open up a bottle of wine
It's some well kept secret that was waiting there all the time

She's raging through my main frame burning out my circuitry
And there's a full blown Frankenstein monster waking up in me
(Call that love)
I call it burning down the main frame
(Call that love)
I call it speeding up the end game
(Call that love)
I call it running in the red
Sitting on a powder keg
Cos that's what it is

Lord how can this be..
All of this for me

Call it dreams on fire
Call it heart's desire
It's a lowdown feeling
The best that you ever had

It's no sign from above
It's called love sweet love
Well you can call it what you want to
But don't try to understand

(Call that love)
Call it rocking my world
(Call that love)
I call it lightning bolts
(Call that love)
Call it turning the key
(Call that love)
Just you and me
(Call that love)
Call it cooking on the range
(Call that love)
Mmmm getting signal again
(Call that love)
Is it too soon to know
(Call that love)
Well maybe so
(Call that love)
(Call that love)
Beaming on broadband
(Call that love)
Drowning on dry land

(Call that love)
Call it getting through
(Call that love)
Call it me and you
(Call that love)
Mmmm call it getting down
Mmmm going to town
Lover, when I'm near you, and I hear you - speak my name
Softly, in my ear you - breathe a flame

Lover, it's immoral, but why quarrel - with our bliss
When, two lips of coral - want to kiss

I say (that) the devil is in you, and to resists you - I try
But if you didn't continue - I would die

Lover, please be tender, when you're tender - fears depart
Lover, I surrender - to my heart
Dark is the night
High is the fire
Touches the sky
Love with no shape or form
I am in your mind's eye
Just let your dreams run wild
I don't mean to hurt you, baby and I'm sorry if I do
I don't really mean to hurt you, woman and I'm sorry if I do
Why should I make myself miserable, baby?
Baby, you know I'm human too
Oh, please don't hate me
Because I know we just don't belong
Oh baby, please don't hate me
I know we just don't belong
I found me someone who wants me
Baby, won't you please set me free?

I have to admit you've been an angel, baby
And I'm grateful for the wife you've been
Oh, I have to admit you've been an angel, baby
And I'm grateful for the wife you've been
Oh, but now my heart belongs to another
So to hold me baby, is really sin

I want you to try to forgive me
Babe, and please try to understand
I want you to please, please forgive me, baby
Babe and please try to understand
You know I didn't make myself, woman
And it's not my fault, got somebody else
Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All these things that won't change
Come what may
But the good times all are gone
And I'm bound for movin' on
I'll look for you if you ever come this way

Think I'll go down to Alberta
Where there's good there in the fall
I've got some friends that I can go workin' for
But I wish you'd change your mind
If I ask you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times or more

Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All these things that don't change
Come what may
But the good times are all gone
And I'm bound for movin' on
I'll look for you if you ever come this way
(A few lines are inaudible)
But by then it would be springtime
There ain't too much for you to do
So I see you when I pass this way again

Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All these things that won't change
Come what may
But the good times are all gone
And I'm bound for movin' on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way

[Hook 3x]
GO TO SLEEP, hoe to sleep, GO TO SLEEP, hoe to sleep
IF YOU'RE TIRED BE QUIET AND GO TO SLEEP, hoe to sleep

[Ludacris]
Maaan, I tell a hoe to go to sleep (go to sleep)
They turn around and frown, gotta make 'em six feet deep
'Cause we knock 'em unconscious with that non-sense
Read inbetween that fine print, think about lyrical con-tent
Then about where your time spent
Mess around get your guys hit; a ten HUUUT!
I send Three-Six ol' sheeyit, nigga WHAAAT?
If ya tired ya tired, if ya snooze ya lose
But'chu you won't wrap up ya bandages, or hell you would

[Infamous 2-0]
Nigga I got shotty's and semi's - I love 'dro and Henne' ?
All brown and skinny, but I've fucked up so many
I got QP's and halves - if we beefin' I blast
You sleepin' I laugh, ask Tit (Titi boi), I'm off the rip
I had this hoe who talked too much; I had to off the bitch
2-0, Mr. Crayola; niggas know what I mean
'Cause I slang brown, white, yellow, purple and green
And all you faggot-muthafuckas gotta know the routine

[Hook 4x]

[Crunchy Black]
Bitch it's me again, kickin' in your fuckin' doors
I look for div-idends - I ain't lookin' for you hoes
You bitch can't com-prehend; let me put one in ya bro
Let me put one in ya bro, so you niggas can go to sleep
So, lay down bitch; gimme all that you dreamed for
Gimme fancy cars, gimme bling-bling-bling, boi
It don't mean a thing, boi, for me that ain't gon' swing, boi
Them god damn toys; do you know what I mean, boi?

[DJ Paul]
Now if you warrin' and runnin' from them Three-Six niggas
This forty-five gon' give a reason to sleep, nigga
Or bustin' massive 'round some S.K
My last trip to A-T-L I fucked yo' cascade
I'm strippin' bitches and I'ma ball fucker with a limp
They call me infer-stripper, sexy, red hoe's pimp
And quick to sink her on the nigga 'cause this what it's 'bout
We rob that trick and stick his dick off in his fuckin' mouth
We Memphis niggas

[Hook 4x]

[Juicy J]
North, north, south, south, Westwood, Orange Mound
Nigga we be smokin' lite; never Cha Cha Charlie Brown
Memphis niggas in this bitch; pockets full, ya know we bail
Hooked up with my nigga 'Cris, then we head to A-T-L
Playas wild, throwin' bows, tellin' chickens, "Fuck you hoe!"
Niggas rollin' Optimo, snortin' that white shit up they nose
Mayne this town is like my town, so we stayed and hung around
Juicy J be high as fuck; catch me in the lost and found

[Lil' Fate]
Better use common sense checkin' me out for bitch I can stand for
And up, get yaself in this clique
Without my tongue licks, behind me gettin' handcuffed by a slut
Look, I'm from Gittero what?
Southside niggas throw it up when it's time to get buck
Niggas in the back of the club postin' up
Waitin' for a nigga that's new to make it up
As in, ain't no askin'; it's no tolerance as long bitch check in
She wit' me, comments will only get'chu basically eternally resting
So abide by the code of the streets
If ya got a bitch better keep her on a leash
Cuz Lil' Fate gonna creep in ya home while you gone
Have you comin' back findin' nutt on yo' sheets

[Hook 4x]

[Verse 1]
After school, walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails
And I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
Trying to recreate images life gives us from our past
And sometimes it's a sad song

[Chorus]
But I, cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama, I've been crying
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun

[Verse 2]
Now, moving on, down my street
I see people I won't ever meet
Think of her, take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps
And sometimes it's a sad song

[Chorus]
But I, cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama, I've been crying
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun

[Verse 3]
The rhythm of her conversation
The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt when she first saw me
Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player
Back and forth and here and gone
And on and on and on and on

[Chorus]
I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama, I've been crying
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun
Yeah, oh oh, yeah
Several miles from the sun
Writer(s): Warren/Dubin

My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
And dear, I wonder if you find love
An optical illusion, too?

Are the stars out tonight?
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear
The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
'Cause I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you
I wouldn't trade Christmas, no, no, never would I
Wouldn't trade Christmas, I love you the best
I wouldn't trade Christmas, no, no, never would I
Wouldn't trade Christmas, I love you the best

It's time for the holly
The fun and the folly
And all of that jolly jazz
The people are glowing
The Santas' ho-ho-ing
Each window is showing it has
All the latest in toy things
The daddy and boy things
And all of that razzamatazz

But I wouldn't trade Christmas
Wouldn't trade Christmas for New Year's Eve
Thanksgiving, Halloween and the rest
Christmas we love you the best

I wouldn't trade Christmas, no, no, no, never would I
Wouldn't trade Christmas, I love you the best
The traffic gets poky
The turkey gets smoky
And all of that hokey stuff
The people are shopping
For things they'll be swapping
Like filigree boxes of snuff
So you pour the hot toddy to toast everybody
But can't pour the toddy enough

But I wouldn't trade Christmas
Wouldn't trade Christmas
For Father's Day or Mother's
Valentine and the rest
Christmas we love you the best

I wouldn't trade Christmas, no, no, no, never would I
Wouldn't trade Christmas, we love you the best

The jingle bells jingle
You feel the old tingle
You buy the Kris Kingle scene
The idea is clever but subways will never
Quite handle that huge evergreen
And the old office party where Stanley and Marty
Keep drinking until they turn green
But I wouldn't trade Christmas
Wouldn't trade Christmas for Labor Day
Or Easter, Washington and the rest
Christmas we love you the best

I wouldn't trade Christmas, no, no, no, never would I
I wouldn't trade Christmas, no, no, no, never would I
I wouldn't trade 'cause we love you the best
Another day...
I might have found the words to say
All the things i meant to say
All the years that passed between
You never understood the meaning of my way
Another day there might have been
Some other way to make
The sacrifice

Another day...
I would try to be a friend
You would never let me in
If I could have it otherwise
I'd chase the demons from your eyes to ease your soul
But now you've reached this other side
Where hopes and broken dreams can't turn the tide

SHOUT!
To the top
SHOUT!
Through your defenses...
SHOUT!
To the top
SHOUT!
Another day...
You might have found your destiny
Knowing that it's meant to be
A self-effacing prodigy
You gave it up for infamy
And fell from grace
And so I wrote this song for you
The only way I know to wish you peace

SHOUT!
To the top
SHOUT!
Through your pretenses...
SHOUT!
To the top
Lay down your defenses
SHOUT!
To the top
Boogie Down Productions will always get paid
We'll take the wackest song and make it better
Remember to let us into your skin
'Cause then you'll begin to master
Rhymin', rhymin', rhymin'

Criminal minded, you've been blinded
Lookin', for a style like mine you can't find it
They are the audience I am the lyricist
Sometimes the suckas on the side gotta hear this

Page, a rage and I'm not in a cage
Free as a bird to fly up out on stage
Ain't here for no frontin', just to say a little somethin'
Ya suckaz don't like me 'cause you're all about nothin'

However, I'm really fascinatin' to the letter
My all around performance gets better and better
My English grammar comes down like a hammer
You need a style, I need to pull your file
I don't beg favors, you're kissin' other people's
I write and produce myself just as fast
Keep my hair like this, got no time for Jheri curls
Attractin' only women, got no time for little girls

'Cause girls look so good
But their brain is not ready, I don't know
I'd rather talk to a woman
'Cause her mind is so steady, so here we go

I'm not a musical maniac or b-boy fanatic
I simply made use of what was upstairs in the attic
I've listened to these MC's back when I was a kid
But I bust more shots than they ever did

I mean this is not the best of KRS, it's just a section
But how many times must I point you in the right direction
You need protection, when I'm on the mic
Because my mouth is like a 9 millimeter windpipe

You're a king, I'm a teacher, you're a b-boy, I'm a scholar
If this was a class well, it would go right under drama
See kings lose crowns but teachers stay intelligent
Talkin' big words on the mic but still irrelevant

Especially when you're not, college material
Wake up every mornin' to your Lucky Charms cereal
DJ Scott LaRock has a college degree
Blastmaster KRS writes poetry
I won't go deeper in the subject 'cause that gets me bored
It's a shame to know some MC's on the mic are fraud
Sayin' styles like this to create a diss
But if you listen, who you dissin'? See I am a musician

Rappin' on the mic like this to me is fine
'Cause if I really want to battle I will put out a nine
You can see that Scott LaRock and I are mentally binded
In other words we're both criminal minded

We're not promoting violence, we're just havin' some fun
He's Scott LaRock, I'm KRS-One
Never off-beat 'cause it don't make sense
Grab the microphone, relaxed and not tense

You waited, debated and now you activated
A musical genius that could not be duplicated
See I have the formula for rockin' the house
If you cannot rock a party do not open your mouth

It's that simple, no phony cosmetics to your pimple
Take another look because the gear is not wrinkled
The K, the R, the S, the O, the N, the E
Sayin' rhyme for eighty-seven not from 1983

Well versed, to rehearse and my rhymes are my curse
Originality come first but the suckers get worse
Allow me to include I have a very stable mood
Poetic education of a high altitude
I'm not an MC, so listen, call me poet or musician
A genius when it comes to makin' music with ambition
I'm cool, collected with the rhyme I directed
Don't wanna be elected as the king of a record

Just respected by others as the man with the solution
An artist of the 80's came and left his contribution
On wax, relax, there's 24 tracks
After years of rockin' parties now I picked up the knack

Because everythin' that flows from out my larynx
Takes years of experience and bottles of Beck's
I cannot seem to recollect the time I didn't have sex
Is it real or is it Memorex?

I'm livin' in a city known as New York State
Sucka MC's gotta wait while I translate
I hang with real live dreads with knowledge in their heads
People with ambition and straight up musicians

Although our lives have been so uprooted
I have it included, you all get zooted
So take each letter of the KRS-One
Means knowledge reigns supreme over nearly everyone

You look at me and laugh, but this is your class
It's an all-out discussion of the suckas I be crushin'
So now you are awakened to the music I be makin'
Never duplicated, and also highly cultivated

Don't get frustrated 'cause nothin' has been traded
Only activated, it came out very complicated
Not separated, from my DJ, you see my voice is now faded
I'll see you folks around the way, criminal minded
Criminal minded, criminal minded, criminal minded
Sonny T.?

[Verse 1]
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck
If a woodchuck could chuck wood?
You can catch Pit in a bed with a mommy on his vet
No questions, you know I'm all good
And if you blink for a minute, I think for a minute
I'ma drink for a minute stops a girl in a mini like
Oh no, wait one minute
For that, feel fair, I'll open it like

[Bridge]
Down down down down

[Pre-Chorus]

If you're sexy and you know it and you really wanna show it
If you're sexy and you know it, clap your hands

[Verse 2]
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck
If a woodchuck could chuck wood?
You could catch me in the city in the state in the country
In the hood, you know I'm all good
'Cause I been raised by them wolves, but I don't play by the rules
As you can see, I made my own moves
Mami's like, "Dammit chico, that's smooth"
Thank you mami, now I move (Dale)

[Bridge]
Down down down down
Down down down down
Turn that booty off
Round 'round 'round 'round

[Intro]
Kumba ya-ya
Oh my soul, of my whole ya-ya-ya
Price so right, my whole ya-ya-ya

[Verse 1]
Born into this world a baby
You're mind is clear as the air
Time passes
You learn to walk and talk
Time passes
You learn right from wrong
Time passes
You leave home seeking a life
Of your own

[Chorus]
I'm tellin' you the natural facts
For way this world
Listen to me people
You make your own heavens and hell
Right here on earth
I'm tellin' you the natural facts
For way this world
You make you own heaven and hell
Right here on earth
On earth, on earth, on earth

[Verse 2]
Time passess
And your values change
Life becomes a strange, confusing game
Suddenly you want the finer things in life
But you find it takes lots of hard work and sacrifice
Now you're standing
At the crossroads of life
To satisfy your personal wants
Will you do wrong
Or will you do right?
Well one thing you must admit
And you know it's true
The final decision
Is still up to you

[Chorus]
I'm tellin' you the natural facts
For way this world
Listen to me people
You make your own heaven and hell
Right here on earth
Let me tell you one more time
I'm tellin' you the natural facts
For way this world
You make your own heaven and hell
Right here on earth

[Verse 3]
Listen people
Life is a giant, invisible scale with two sides;
Good and bad
You and your beliefs
Are the weights
The things you do each day
Determine the balance
Your conscience is a flawless
Judge and jury;
The only question is what you want

[Chorus]
I'm tellin' you the natural facts
For way this world
You make your own heaven and hell
Right here on earth
One more time, now listen
I'm tellin' you the natural facts
For way this world
You make your own heaven and hell
Right here on earth
Listen to me
You make your own heaven and hell
Right here on earth
Hate, Love and War
Force emotions to the fore
But not for me of course, of course
I keep mine hidden

I keep mine hidden
But it's so easy for you
Because you let yours flail
Into public view

Yellow and green, a stumbling block
I'm a twenty-digit combination to unlock
With a past where to be touched
Meant to be mental

I KEEP MINE hidden
The lies are so easy for you
Because you let yours slide
Into public view

(Use your loaf!)

By a country road wild roses grow that need my special care
So I haven't time to be a millionaire
And a cheerful brook on a mountain side, is sad when I'm not there
So I haven't time to be a millionaire
And a friendly gang of robins are peeved when I forget

That I'm the second tenor in their quartet
So with all the things I have to do, I'm very much aware
If I wished for wealth it wouldn't be quite fair
'cause I haven't time to be a millionaire
When I saw you this morning, baby
Tell me why did you walk away
When I saw you this morning, baby
Tell me why did you walk away
Can't believe that you don't love me
Thought our love was here to stay

Now buzz me, baby
I'll be waiting for your call
Buzz me, buzz me, buzz me
Buzz me, baby
I'll be waiting for your call
If you forgot the number
Come on over
You won't have to call at all

I never lied to no one
I ain't gonna lie to you
When I say I'm yours forever
Every word I say is true
Buzz me, baby
I'll be waiting for your call
If you forgot the number
Come on over
You won't have to call at all
Yes, buzz me, baby
I'm like the ship that's lost at sea
Buzz me, buzz me, baby
You mean so much to me
If I ever get my arms around you
I ain't gonna let go till 1973
Turn off your mind relax and float down stream
It is not dying, it is not dying

Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining

Yet you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

Love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing

And ignorance and hate mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not leaving, it is not leaving

So play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Nobody knows where you are, how near or how far
Shine on you crazy diamond
Pile on many more layers and i'll be joining you there
Shine on you crazy diamond
And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph
And sail on the steel breeze
Come on you boy child, you winner and loser
Come on you miner for truth and delusion, and shine!
I'll be waiting
Right here waiting

Talk to my brother
Just the other day
He was feeling kind of low
If he could not turn to me
Where could I go
Don't know how
I strayed so far away
I wanna come home
But I'm afraid it's a little too late

I replied to him
Don't say too late
Jesus is waiting with
Open arms
He's right there
He's right there
With open arms
Cast upon him all your cares
Open arms
He's right there
With open arms just for you yeah
He looked at me with tears in his eyes
Oh it's breakin' my heart
To see a grown man cry
Hardcore image
Digested lies
No rest for the weary
He needed peace inside
I replied to him
Never say too late
For Jesus is always waiting
With open arms
He's sayin' I love you
And there's nothing you can do
That I will turn my back on you
Open arms
Open arms

I'll be I'll be waiting
Gonna be right here waiting
I'll be I'll be waiting
You say you don't know where to go
But I've come to let you know
That jesus is waiting
He's right here waiting
If you're heavy laden
He'll give you rest
If you have a burden
He wants you to give that burden to you
Will you let him in
He has open arms
He has wonderful open arms
Give it all to the master
He's waiting
With open arms
Give it all to him
Give it all to him
He's waiting
With open arms
I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting
Heart full of compassion
He wants to do for you
What he's done for so many others
He's right there waiting
With open arms
Arms of love
Arms of peace
Arms of joy
I'll be waiting
Right here waiting
I'll be waiting
He's right there waiting
Just for you
Just for you
Waiting
I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting

[Intro:]
Y'all ready?
Well, well
Can I get a witness
I wanna talk about something tonight, ooh

[Verse 1:]
Everybody wants somebody
You can't show me a woman that don't want nobody
Everybody needs somebody
And that's alright, ah
But tonight you out there lookin' for somebody
But you'll never find nobody
That will believe in
And love you like me baby
And treat you the way you wanna be treated

[Verse 2:]
Mistakes, oh I made a few baby
Oh, but I'm not perfect, woman
Neither are you, babe
You'll never find nobody, hey
To give you all the stuff you need
You know what that stuff is, babe
And Lord, and make love, ah
Just the way you like it girl
I give you head, oh but don't be mislead, babe
(Pay attention, girl)
Oh, you need to remember what I taught you in bed
I showed you baby
Oh now you got me down on my knees baby, begging

[Bridge:]
I know your friends don't like me
But they ain't about nothing
They ain't got nothing
They always tryin' to stab and start something
But before you leave

[Vamp:]
You need to think about it baby
You know you doin' it wrong baby
Oh and you about to see that babe
We come too far, we come too far to turn around baby
Oh I put too much in you little girl
Hey, oh yeah

[Verse 3:]
I know everybody wants somebody
That makes sense
Everybody needs somebody
And that's alright too
Oh but girl, tonight you out there lookin' for somebody
That ain't no good
You'll never find nobody
That love you like me baby
And treat you, treat you, treat you
The way a woman needs to be treated
Oh don't let your friends
Don't let your friends ruin your home baby
They ain't got nothing
They ain't got nothing
They send it home, send it home all alone

[Vamp:]
But before you leave, oh think
Whoa, use your head girl
Oh you need to think baby
Call your lover's
Call 'em off baby
They like dogs
Greedy like hogs
Yeah, yeah
Oh, you better think
Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud I can't understand
I get misty just holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello, that music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left, my hat and my glove
I get misty and too much in love
Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may noy last long

We can work it out
We can work it out

Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight, or say good night

We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting my friend
I have always thought, that it's a crime
So I will ask you, once, again
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long

We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting my friend
I have always thought, that it's a crime
So I will ask you, once, again

Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long

We can work it out
We can work it out

[Verse 1: Wanya & Nate]
I long for
The warmth of
Days gone by
When you were mine
But now those days are memories in time
Life's empty
Without you
By my side
My heart belongs to you
No matter what I try

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn]
When I get the courage up to love somebody new
It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
Your love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

[Chorus]
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean
Where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves
The trees are bare when you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same, oh)

[Verse 2: Nathan & (Mike)]
Remember
The nights when (remember the night)
We closed our eyes (when we closed our eyes)
And vowed that you and I
Would be in love for all time

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn]
Everytime I think about these things I shared with you
I break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional
Until you release me I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

[Chorus]
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here
It doesn't feel the same

[Bridge: Wanya & (Mike)]
This loneliness has crushed my heart (it's killing me, baby)
Please let me love again (I just wanna know if I can fix this)

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn]
'Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain
Or four seasons will bring the loneliness again

[Chorus]
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same)

[Outro: Nate]
Remember
The warmth of
Days gone by
Well I guess that you probably know by now
I was one who wanted to fly
I wanted to ride on that arrow of fire right up into heaven
And I wanted to go for every man
Every child, every mother of children
I wanted to carry the dreams of all people right up to the stars

And I prayed that I'd find an answer there
Or maybe I would find a song
Giving a voice to all of the hearts that cannot be heard
And for all of the ones who live in fear
And all of those who stand apart
My being there would bring us a little step closer together

They were flying for me
They were flying for everyone
They were trying to see a brighter day for each and everyone

They gave us their light
They gave us their spirit and all they could be
They were flying for me
They were flying for me
And I wanted to wish on the Milky Way
And dance upon a falling star
I wanted to give myself and free myself, and join myself with it all

Given the chance to dream, it can be done
The promise of tomorrow is real
Children of spaceship Earth
The future belongs to us all

She was flying for me
She was flying for everyone
She was trying to see a brighter day for each and everyone

She gave us her light
She gave us her spirit and all she can be
She was flying for me
They were flying for me
They were flying for everyone
They were trying to see a brighter day for each and everyone
They gave us their light
They gave us their spirit and all they could be
They were flying for me
I went down to Virginia and no one sent for me
I went down to Virginia to see what I could see
Well I found the horses that some of the gals took bets
The spirits of the states are guaranteed high sets
So I stayed down in Virginia 'cause that looked good to me
I went down to Virginia and I didn't know a soul
No wonder folks befriend ya, their hearts are made of pure gold
While the civic minded citizens are all so kind
They feed you with you hook a fish on every line
So I stayed down in Virginia, that's how much I've been sold
So bless the day that brought me here
And bless the folks I love so dear
Well, brother, if you ever plan a'coming this way
You find the things that's just exactly like I say
I stayed down in Virginia, Virginia USA

Yes, I went down to Virginia, I went by my request
No one needs recommend ya, 'cause you are a welcome guest
Well, I never thought I'd find a place where I could be
Just happy as a jaybird in a cherry tree
So I stayed down in Virginia, 'cause that's the very best
So bless the day that brought me here
And bless the folks I love so dear
Why, I plumb forgot to mention 'bout the biggest deal
My gal is named Virginia, that's Virginia real
So I stayed down in Virginia, Virginia, Virginia, USA
When I was just a wee little boy, full of health and joy
One Christmas morning I received The Marvellous Little Toy
A wonder to behold it was with many colours bright
And the moment I laid eyes on it, it became my heart's delight

It went zip when it moved and bop when it stopped whirrrrr when it stood still
I never knew just what it was and I guess I never will

The first time that I picked it up I had a big surprise
For right on it's bottom were two big buttons that looked like big green eyes
I first pushed one and then the other, then I twisted its lid
And when I set it down again, this is what it did

It went zip when it moved and bop when it stopped whirrrrr when it stood still
I never knew just what it was and I guess I never will

It first marched left and then marched right, then marched under a chair
And when I looked where it had gone it wasn't even there
I started to cry but my Daddy laughed 'cause he knew that I would find
When I turned around my marvellous toy would be chugging from behind
It went zip when it moved and bop when it stopped and whirrrrr when it stood still
I never knew just what it was and I guess I never will

The years have gone by too quickly it seems, I have my own little boy
And yesterday I gave to him my marvellous little toy
His eyes nearly popped right out of his head and he gave a squeal of glee...
Neither one of us knows just what it is but he loves it just like me

It still goes zip when it moves and bop when it stops, whirrrrr when it stands still
I never knew just what it was and I guess I never will

[Outro: Jennifer Lopez]
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
Listen to me lady
So it's understood
This runnin' round life
Ain't doing me no good
I get tired
Get so tired of paying dues
But it seems there ain't no way around it
No end to runnin' blue

But I like to have my fun
Like to run around
And I ain't no stranger
In nobody's town
But I get tired
Get so tired of changing views
And the road don't get no shorter
Runnin' round and runnin' blue

Well this runnin' round life
Might seem nice and easy
But when you're blowing with the wind
Sometimes it gets real breezy
A man gets tired
I feel like I was born to lose
And there ain't no way around it
No way round runnin' blue
Got no holes in my pockets
No holes in my shoes
But I don't know if I'm leaving Detroit
Or coming into Baton Rouge
I get tired
So tired of changing views
And there ain't no way around it
No way round runnin' blue

Left my billfold at the airport
My suitcase on a train
Now I can't find my umbrella
And it sure looks like rain
I get tired
So tired of playing to lose
And the road don't get no shorter
When you got the runnin' blues

Well the night life ain't a good life
But it's my life too
Once you're bound to this highway
Ain't nothing you can do
Except get tired
Oh get tired of paying dues
And there ain't no way around it
No way round runnin' blue

[Chorus]
I don't need to ever exchange, you know I
I don't need to ever replace, you know I
I'm not going any damn place, you know I
You should know that I, I, I, (oh) I
I don't need no other one, I don't need no other one, I don't (oh)
I don't need no other one, I don't need no other one
All I need is you (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
All I need is you (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 1]
Baby can't you see, baby can't you see (oh, oh, oh)
You're the one I need, only one I need (oh, oh, oh)
That I can't believe, no I can't believe (oh, oh, oh)
Would ever think, I would ever leave (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm staying here, I ain't going nowhere
You should know I, I, (oh) I

[Chorus]
I don't need to ever exchange, you know I
I don't need to ever replace, you know I
I'm not going any damn place, you know I
You should know that I, I, I, (oh) I
I don't need no other one, I don't need no other one, I don't (oh)
I don't need no other one, I don't need no other one
All I need is you (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
All I need is you (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
Baby one more thing, baby one more thing (oh, oh, oh)
You should hold this ring, you should hold this ring (oh, oh, oh)
'Cause it means my heart, 'cause it means my heart (oh, oh, oh)
It'll never part, it'll never part (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm staying here, I ain't going nowhere
You should know I, I, I

[Chorus]
I don't need to ever exchange, you know I
I don't need to ever replace, you know I
I'm not going any damn place, you know I
You should know that I, I, I, (oh) I
I don't need no other one, I don't need no other one, I don't (oh)
I don't need no other one, I don't need no other one
All I need is you (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
All I need is you (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Bridge]
Look, I don't need change but you know what that's funny
Can't you see that Taio Cruz got money
Money, cash I'll leave on my tip
On a ten dollar meal no change for my hundred
Rockstar shades got me looking so stunning
Stunning, that's how it looks when we be
Hand in hand, and walking the streets
When nobody else can match our flavor
How would you ever think that I was ever gonna change ya
I ain't never gonna change ya

[Chorus]
I don't need to ever exchange, you know I
I don't need to ever replace, you know I
I'm not going any damn place, you know I
You should know that I, I, I, (oh) I
I don't need no other one, I don't need no other one, I don't (oh)
I don't need no other one, I don't need no other one
All I need is you (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
All I need is you (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I said baby I don’t)

[Outro]
I don't need no other one, I don't need no other one, I don't (oh)
I don't need no other one, I don't need no other one
All I need is you (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
All I need is you (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
All I need is you

[MG:] Oh baby, there's a letter on the floor
That I just can't read no more
'Cause the words upon its face are sayin' goodbye
There's a plate upon the table
Filled with food I could not eat
There's a made-up bed in the bedroom where I couldn't sleep
I just sit & weep
Oh baby, that's how it is since you've been gone
That's how it is, I'm so all alone

[TT:] Now the curtains are drawn in my lonely room
& the darkness fills the air
& this old empty heart of mine is in despair
Even though the tears I shed
Washed the words away
I could still remember every word you had to say
They just wouldn't go away
Oh baby, that's how it is since you've been gone
That's how it is, I'm so all alone

[MG:] Oh baby, you knew right from the start
That my heart was in your hands

[TT:] & your every, every wish, boy, was my command
That's why I can't understand
How you could leave me here helpless, dear
Alone & afraid, oh how could such a mistake be made?
But that's how it is since you've been gone
That's how it is, I'm so alone, oh baby
That's how it is since you've been gone
That's how it is, I'm so alone
Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
Snapshot in the family album
Daddy what else did you leave for me?
Daddy, what'd'ja leave behind for me?
All in all it was just a brick in the wall
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall
Willow weep for me
Willow weep for me
Bend your branches green along the stream that runs to sea
Listen to my plea
Listen, willow, and weep for me

Gone, my lovers dream
Lovely summer dream
Gone and left me here to weep my tears into the stream
Sad as I can be
Hear me, willow, and weep for me

Whisper to the wind and say that love has sinned
Leave my heart a-breakin' and makin' a moan
Murmur to the night to hide her starry light
So none will find me sighing and crying all alone

Weeping willow tree
Weep in sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
When the shadows fall
Bend, oh willow, and weep for me
Oh, weepin' willow tree
Weep in sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
When the shadows fall
Hear me, willow, and weep for me
Virgil Caine is the name, I served on the Danville Train
So much cavalry came and tore up the tracks again
In the summer of sixty-five we were hungry just barely alive
By May the tenth Richmond had fell it's a time I remember so well

The night they drove old Dixie down and the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down and the people were singin'
They went la na na na na na la na na na na na na na

Back home in Tennessee my wife called out for me
Say Virgil come quick and see there goes Robert E Lee
I don't mind choppin' wood and I don't care if da money ain't good
You take what you need and save the rest but they should never have taken the
Very best

The night they drove old Dixie down and the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down and the people were singin'
They went la na na na na na la na na na na na na na

Like my father before me he was a workin' man
Like my brother above me he took a rebel's stand
He was just eighteen proud and brave when a Yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the blood beneath my feet you can't raise a Caine back up when he's
In defeat
The night they drove old Dixie down and the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down and the people were singin'
They went la na na na na na la na na na na na na na

The night they drove old Dixie down and the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down and the people were singin'
They went la na na na na na la na na na na na na na...
My daddy told me always be strong son
Don't you ever cry
You find the pretty girls and then you love them
Then you say goodbye
I never dreamed that you would leave me
But now you're gone
I never dreamed that I would miss you
Woman won't you come back home

I never dreamed that you could hurt me
And leave me blue
I've had a thousand, maybe more
But never one like you
I never dreamed I could feel so empty
But now I'm down
I never dreamed that I would beg you
Woman I need you now

It seems to me I took your love for granted
It feels to me that this time I was wrong, so wrong
Oh Lord how I feel so lonely
I say woman won't you come back home
I tried to do what my daddy taught me
But I think he knew
Someday that I would find one woman like you
I never dreamed that it could feel so good, Lord
That two could be one
I never knew about sweet love
So woman won't you come back home
Oh baby won't you come back home
We got fizzin' appointments
Which lead to agreements
And now we're in different regions
When will we meet again
So let's set the record straight
The needle's in my vein
Can we start a brand new slate
Oh can we wait another day

You're on an undeveloped road
You need to travel what you know
It would help you more
It would help you more
It would help you more

It's not as far as it could be
And I ain't lookin' where you are
This type of thing ain't too bad
Oh girl, you know I made those plans
Dance dammit dance
I rule
Dance dammit dance
I rule
Dance dammit dance
I rule
Dance dammit dance
I rule

I was bored
I needed new drugs
An' everybody bitin' shit
Is gettin' fucked up
M.I.A. rollin' wit Blaqstarr
Anyone talking shit
I'm gonna blow em up

Who's mad, who's crazy, who's fucked up?
It's about time I rack em all up
More fire, more power, more wound up
I'm the queen of this shit
Don't bother steppin' up
Dance dammit dance
I rule
Dance dammit dance
I rule
Dance dammit dance
I rule
Dance dammit dance
I rule

What I got you can't get from ya mama
What I got you can't get from ya ho
What I got you can't get from ya mama
What I got you can't get from ya ho

I got alien aphrodisiacs
Found visiting planets of the zodiac
Got a six pack so you don't get side track
Be in Baltimore tonight on the amtrack

Got a Mac with PCP for ya lap
Same effects as LSD and smack
Boom boom I'm bringin you the new crack
Like a club track made from Iraq

What I got you can't get from ya mama

Get to you in high tech pro tool
Woop woop chop screw in hotels
Club cars in the street front of people
At home we can play some scruples
But tonight I'll wait 'til the nightfall
Like a ninja glide over waterfalls
Get to you to give you a lil rock and roll
Tap tap that bed to the wall
Tap tap that bed to the wall
Tap tap that bed to the wall
Tap tap that bed to the wall

What I got you can't get from ya mama

It will come to us as a shock
But we're letting it happen
People with their carelessness
Governments with their laissez faire

Are going to lead us straight to it
That's for sure
History will only repeat itself
Once more

The western world is going
More and more right wing yearning
For some sort of protection
Too scared to do anything

Not to take the path that's
Dragging us down, oh, no
Remember it's in our
Power not to go down

It will come to us as a shock
But we're letting it happen
People with their carelessness
Governments with their laissez faire
I can feel it more and more
Within ten years we'll have a war
I can feel it more and more
Within ten years we'll have a war

It will come to us as a shock
But we're letting it happen
People with their carelessness
Governments with their laissez faire

The western world is going
More and more right wing yearning
For some sort of protection
Too scared to do anything
A tint of blue , deep down inside my heart, each time I see you
It would take a lot to ease my pain from all these chains

A tint of red , each time I see you with another
Just because I was your lover , jealous I
I get so angry I could cry

A tint of blue , why do you make me feel so sad
Why do you leave me feeling bad they way I do
A tint of blue

A tint of red , each time I see you with another
Just because I was your lover, jealous I
I get so angry I could cry
You broke your promise, baby
You don't love, honor or obey
You won't do nothing I tell you
You go on mistreating me everyday
You're hardly acting your part, baby
You won't do nothing the preacher says

You don't love me, baby
You don't even wish me well
Honor's just a joke with you, baby
You don't love me, I can tell
Married life with you, baby
I'd rather be living in a cell

You deceive me, baby
You use me like a child
You tricked me into loving you, baby
I was loving you all the while
You played with my heart, baby
I said I was loving you all the while

[Intro: T-Pain]

Well there's two trains running
And they're running this way
One leaves at midnight
The other at the break of day
At the break of day
At the break of day
Oh Lordy

I've been troubled, I've been a fool
I've been crazy my whole life
Well, I done fell in love
With another man's wife
With another man's wife
Oh, Lordy

I'm gonna find me a woman
Who shines like a morning star
I'm gonna find me a woman
Ride like a Cadillac car
Ride like a Cadillac car
Ride like a Cadillac car
Oh, lordy
Oh, lordy
Well I'm afraid of everybody
And I can't trust myself
Well, the woman I love has
Put me on top of the shelf
Put me on top of the shelf
Put me on top of the shelf
Oh, Lordy
Oh, Lordy

Well ther's two trains running
And they're running this way
One leaves at midnight
Other at the break of day
At the break of day
At the break of day
At the break of day
Soft as a raindrop, fresh as the sea
Warm as the sunshine shining on me
This was my love, this was my love

Light was her laughter, few were her tears
Gentle her beauty, tender her years
This was my love, this was my love

So young, so fair, such bright golden hair
A smile always on her face
No other love can ever compare
No other can take her place

Others may cherish fortune or fame
I will forever cherish her name
For this was my love
This was my love!
I know so many people who think they can do it alone
They isolate their heads and stay in their safety zones

Now what can you tell them
And what can you say that won't make them defensive

I know there's an answer
I know now but I have to find it by myself

They come on like they're peaceful
But inside they're so uptight
They trip through their day
And waste all their thoughts at night

Now how can I come on
And tell them the way that they live could be better

I know there's an answer
I know now but I have to find it by myself

Now how can I come on
And tell them the way that they live could be better
I know there's an answer
I know now but I have to find it by myself
Big bikes squish lanes
When we hit the town, yeah it's going down
Poe up 'til we toe up, but the party never end
Then wake up tomorrow we gon' do this shit again
Do this shit again (2x)

Wake back up tomorrow we gon' do this shit again
The money keep comin' so the party never end
Wake back up tomorrow we gon' do this shit again

[Verse 1]
What child is this, who, laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?

[Chorus]
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him laud
The babe, the son of Mary

[Verse 2]
Why lies he in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christian, fear: for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading

[Chorus]
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him laud
The babe, the son of Mary

[Verse 3]
So bring him incense, gold, and myrrh
Come, peasant, king, to own him
The King of Kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone him

[Chorus]
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him laud
The babe, the son of Mary
Every day in the week I'm in a different city
If I stay too long people try to pull me down
They talk about me like a dog
Talkin' about the clothes I wear
But they don't realize they're the ones who's square

Hey!
And that's why
You can't hold me down
I don't want to be down
I gotta move
Hey

Stone free do what I please
Stone free to ride the breeze
Stone free I can't stay
I got to got to got to get away

Alright
Listen to this baby
A woman here a woman there try to keep me in a plastic cage
But they don't realize it's so easy to break
Oh, but sometimes I get--ha
I can feel my heart kind of runnin' hot
That's when I've got to move before I get caught

And that's why
Listen to me baby, you can't hold me down
I don't want to be tied down
I gotta be free
Ow!

I said
Stone free do what I please
Stone free to ride the breeze
Stone free I can't stay
Got to got to got to get away
Yeah, ow!
Turn me loose baby

Yeah!
Stone free to ride on the breeze
Stone free do what I please
Stone free I can't stay
Stone free got to got to get away
Stone free I'm gonna leave right now
Stone free don't try to hold me back baby
Stone free I'm movin' on down the highway, yeah
Stone free got to got to got to got to
Stone free bye bye baby
Stone free

From daybreak to sunset you are the heart of me
Saying what you don't really mean
Now I know where you go and all the plans you made
Playing for a love not a dream
All that I want is you now and somehow I let you down
Lost in my pain, that where I lie

You got to stop, think again, before you give it to him
Stop, baby, one of us got to lose
You gotta stop, think again, before you lost the heaven
Stop, baby one of us got to try

Oh, It's a great big world that we live in
Pleasure and pain, that's where I lie
You got to stop, think again, before you give it to him
Stop, baby, one of us got to try

Midnight you leave me taking the part of me
That loves you like he loves you, only more
Birds cry ,my sky falls
Darkness becomes my life, he got you
I got nothing to be living for
Oh, It's a great big world that we live in
Pleasure and pain, that's where I lie
You got to stop, think again before you give it to him
Stop, baby one of us, one of us, one of us
You got to stop, think again before you lose the heaven
Stop baby one of us got to try
Chorus
You got the vocab
I got the vocab
You got the vocab
You know I got the vocab
You got the vocab
I got the vocab
Hey, yo pass the mic so I can tell 'em I got the gift o' gab
Monkey see, monkey what? Monkey, monkey be yourself. (x3)
Hey yo catch me when I'm sober, but now I drink for the belt
So pass the root straight to the right hand side
Make no mistake that the buzz is a natural high
I said it's big emergency mind your busy body
He hit me. I broke his nose. The referee's Mr Fuji
So hey to the blue jay, mocking bird don't mock
The last bird who mocked he got caught in my roughneck chicken pot
So Mr Rooster give me a crookedy croo at 6am
He looked at me a laughin' said my music would make F.M
Station. You're Haitian. You'll never get nowhere
But I sweared on my grandmother grave we'd be here
So now when I back track
I back track far enough to make a nigga run and leave his tongue back
You think I'm cool I think you're cruel so here's a shell cap
On your gluteus maximus and leave ya handicapped
Ratatatat
Chorus

Hoboes above leave the boat for the Pope (?) (x3)
Boat people here we go Hi De Hi De Hi De Ho Yeah
Some quest for the truth, some bust a loop
And search for some knowledge that come runnin' in the woods
And if I should a choose to be one
Then I will be a ???? hoodin' with books and look to kill
My proof is in my puddin'
If I chill in the hood would you be say that I'm hoodin'?
Now. Let me exercise a new style that will brutalise
MCs into a warpath genocide
Nobody move, nobody get hurt. It's a homocide
So jump jump punks ready to get stuck
Evil Kenevil was my man, someone for the stunts
I'm mostly fillies, I'm just straight up front, ha
Meat ya tryin' to light up you get blast like nitrogen
Runnin' for mercy, runnin' for oxygen
Bad L.A. meat you're better off comittin' suicide
I shoot the lip so high I strip you of your carbon dioxide
Rock-a-bye the lullaby he be singin' 'Oh my'
Boof Baff another son a go die
What's the matter with the black man? (Black man) (x2)
Now a statistic. So dreams of her become realistic

Poor bastard gets mystic I don't believe you checked the psychic
Emancipate your mind. Don't set the limit. Reach the summit
Free your spirit 'cause your blunted
From the lyrics I just stuttered
'Live off the streets' says the brother with the machete
'Live off the lady' says the brother with the Glock in patrol
I live logically, no weak slave to poverty
You see it's very easy to slip between the asphalt sheet
Brothers from my way they used to get mad plays
Till they caught us bustin' doughnuts 'til the break of day
Brother, my brother, you played me undercover
She wouldn't be your lover so now you tried to dis her
For sister. You missed her but ask yourself a question
Can I make a suggestion? I need a true confession
Is she skivs 'cause the skin that she's in makes you sin?
Does you hit her just to get her integrate another sister?
Mister. I asked him for a hanky. He asked if he could spank me
So why'd you disrespect me, sir?
Were you thinking I'm misguided or were you tryin to hide it
That you had no father figure
Which? Check out your wackness. It won't distrust my blackness
I wonder for a smack, but don't think that it would help this
What's the matter with the black man (Black man)
All original gunman dem original good (Bahahahahahahaha) (x2)
Come jackin' it up an' I bad an' me fell in ma booby trap
With a rappin' up for the eight track play back laid back sit back
An I'll ???? an me runnin' ???? as a matter a fact
'Cause I trappin' a back like a cool six pack now bring it back. Woah!
United we stand, divided we crumble
What's the flavour? More Babylon, more Babylon, more Babylon fall (x2)
These days every man want to be a god
Lay down the gun every man on the floor
But the real gunman him not play Hollywood role
Because he pull out his gun and send another boy down
Watch us bleed. Another gunman go bleed
Watch us bleed. If I used up all my dust I got ????
Watch us bleed. Me up an' comin' ready
Watch us bleed. Watch us for original Tranzlator Crew
Oh, er, every time we come, we come correct, see
We out
If the music makes you move
'Cause you can't get the groove, then groove on
If you feel like you wanna make love
Under the stars above, then love on girl
Then love on
If it something that you wanna say
And talking is the only way, then rap on
Brother, then rap on
But whatever you wanna do
Oh, you gotta do your thing, yeah, yeah
(Do your thing, do your thing, do your thing)
Do your thing
If you feel like you wanna scream
'Cause that's your way of letting all speak
Scream on, scream on
If you feel like you wanna sing
'Cause singing is your only thing
Sing on, sing on
If you wanna make love all night
And you feel it's right
Ride on, ride on
Oo, 'cause whatever you wanna do
Oh, you gotta do your thing, thing, thing, thing, yeah, yeah
(Do your thing, do your thing)

Do your thing (ay, ay)
Do it right (oh, do it, yeah) hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm
Do your thing (can you do it, can you do it, can you do it?)
The waves in my fade will make a bitch need a surfboard
I ain't on the track like GDs, Crips, and Vice Lords
Plus Latin Kings, if ya bang throw yo rag up
Whole clique flagged up, zone ghetto tags up
Black car, white guts, you can call it Oreo
Gucci bring pies to yo door like he Dominoes
Soldier like Geronimo my house big as the
Pinnacle
Used to trap at Texaco but now I'm finna buy the one
Rims on my M, bitch a trim, wanna lay with him
Slim with the tilted grill, flossin all the diamond gems
Actually trapping got me counting cash rapidly
Wheels spin backwardly, Bricksquad factory

Ooh my smoke my Glock my bro I'm strapped in here with no seat belt
And I move the punchlines I'm pimpin the track

Million worth of jewelry on, when now, right now

Chopper size of you shower, rims bigger than your house
When you see me girl smile, I stay for a lil while
In the back with a strap and the clip don't crack

My dead homies could see me now

Bouldercrest my stomping ground
Stand 10 toes down to stomp you down

Gucci Mane invisible mane I'm right man can't see me lame

For it's there that I belong and we'll never part
Love me tender, love me true, all my dreams fulfill
For, my darlin', I love you and I always will

Love me tender, love me dear

[Verse 1]
I awoke today and found a frost perched on the town
It hovered in a frozen sky, then it gobbled summer down
When the sun turns traitor cold
And all the trees are shivering in a naked row
I get the urge for going but I never seem to go

[Chorus]
I get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
Summertime is falling down
And winter's closing in

[Verse 2]
I had me a man in summertime, he had summer-colored skin
And not another girl in town my darling's heart could win
But when the leaves fell on the ground, bully winds came around
Pushed them face-down in the snow
He got the urge for going and I had to let him go

[Chorus]
He got the urge for going
When the meadow grass was turning brown
Summertime was falling down
And winter was closing in

[Verse 3]
Now the warriors of winter, they gave a cold triumphant shout
And all that stays is dying and all that lives is getting out
See the geese in chevron flight
Flapping and racing on before the snow
They got the urge for going and they got the wings so they can go

[Chorus]
They get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
And summertime is falling down
And winter's closing in

[Verse 4]
I'll ply the fire with kindling now, I'll pull the blankets up to my chin
I'll lock the vagrant winter out and I'll fold my wandering in
I'd like to call back summertime
Have her stay for just another month or so
But she's got the urge for going so I guess she'll have to go

[Chorus]
She gets the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
All her empire's falling down
And winter's closing in

[Outro]
And I get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
And summertime is falling down

[Intro]
Don't leave me, don't leave me here
On the dark side of the world (Oh baby)
Don't leave me, don't leave me here
On the dark side of the world

[Verse 1]
'Cause my days are darker than your nights
Since I lost you, babe, since I lost you, babe
I'm like an ember fading out of sight
One more tear and I know I'll disappear
(Bring back the sunshine) Ooh, come back, baby
(That you took away) Oh, 'cause I need you and I want you
And I just don't think I'm gonna make it without your love

[Chorus]
Don't leave me, don't leave me here
On the dark side of the world

[Verse 2]
'Cause such loneliness I've never known
Since I lost you, babe, since I lost you, babe
I'm like a man who once knew splendor
Now all his wealth and riches, they're all gone
(Bring back the sunshine) Listen, honey
(That you took away) Listen to me, if you can't come yourself
Please, don't send nobody else, oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Bring back the sunshine, baby, that you took away
Now my future lies in back of me
Since I lost you, baby, since I lost you, baby
I'll walk this lonely road into eternity
Just despair and emptiness everywhere
(Bring back the sunshine) Bring it on back, baby
(That you took away) 'Cause I need you and I want you
And I just don't think I'm gonna make it without your love

[Outro]
Don't leave me, don't leave me here (Woo)
On the dark side of the world
(Don't leave me, so dark out here)
Don't leave me, don't leave me here (Baby)
On the dark side of the world
(Baby, woo, don't leave me, darling)
Don't leave me, don't leave me here
(I don't want you to leave me, baby)
On the dark side of the world
(Woo, oh baby)
Don't leave me, don't leave me here
(Don't leave me)
On the dark side of the world
(I can't see — where will I go?)
Grease is the word, is the word that you heard
It's got groove, it's got meaning

We solve our problems and we see the light
We gotta plug and think, we gotta feed it right
There ain't no danger, we can go too far
We start believing now that we can be who we are

Grease is the word

They think our love is just a growing pain
Why don't they understand it's just a crying shame?
Their lips are lying, only real is real
We start believing now that we can be who we feel

Grease is the word

Grease is the word, is the word that you heard
It's got groove, it's got meaning
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Grease is the way we are feeling
We take the pressure and we throw away
Conventionality belongs to yesterday
There is a chance that we can make it so far
We start believing now that we can be who we are

Grease is the word

Grease is the word, is the word that you heard
It's got groove, it's got meaning
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Grease is the way we are feeling

Grease is the word, is the word that you heard
It's got groove, it's got meaning
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Grease is the way we are feeling

Grease is the word
Is the word
Is the word
Is the word
Is the word
Is the word...
Looking back over my years
I guess, I've shed some tears
Told myself time and again
This time I'm gonna win

But another fight things ain't right
And I'm losing again
Takes a fool to lose twice
And start all over again

Think I'd better let it go
'Cause it looks like another love T.K.O., oh, yeah
Said, "I'd better let it go
Because it looks like another love T.K.O."

I tried to take control of my love
Love took control of me
See, you lose all thought and sense of time
You have a change of mind

Takin' the bumps and the bruises
And all the things of a two-time loser
See, I try to hold on but my faith is gone
It's another sad song
So I'd better let it go
'Cause it looks like another love T.K.O
Said, "I'd better let it go, na, na, na, na
'Cause it looks like another love T.K.O."

You got me going in circles, a-ha
Can't get my feet back on the ground, oh, oh

I tried to take control of my love
Love took control of me
See you lose all thought all sense of time
You get a change of mind

Takin' the bumps and the bruises
And all the things of a two time loser
And I try to hold on but my faith has gone
It's another sad song

Said, "I'd better let it go now
'Cause it looks like another love T.K.O
Better let it go
Because it looks like another love T.K.O

Let it go, T.K.O., yeah
Got to let it go now
'Cause it looks like another love T.K.O

[Verse 1]
Well she come around here
Just about midnight
Lord, she make me feel so good
She make me feel alright

[Chorus]
And she spell her name G-L-O-R-IIIIII-A, G-L-O-R-I-A

[Verse 2]
Now she come around to my house
Just about midnight
And uh she walks up to my street
And knocks on my door
She come up my stairs, now, can you dig it
And knock on my one more time door again
She comes across my room
And I'm layin' up there sleeping
She kiss me on my belly
She make me feel like plum jelly

[Chorus]
And said our uh, hey baby
Hey hey hey hey baby
Whoa baby
I come to, come to make love to you
And I say uh, "hey girl what's your name?"
Said "that don't make no difference anyway
Well in the meantime, while I play to you
You can call me Gloria
Gloria now, Gloria, Gloria
And she make me feel so good
Whoa and it feel so good baby
Ohh make it feel so good, ha
Make me lose my voice
Yeah... it's alright baby
Hey baby

[Verse 3]
And I called her, I say woo-ee, yeah
Yeah, you sure make me feel good, baby
I'm sure some of y'all out there got some girls name Gloria
Like Mitch Mitchell has one name Gloria
And I seen it all happen
You know, we was at a scene one night
And I seen this little boog-a-bear come around
She look like a draggin' in her carlisle
Her hair was like, that long
But anyway I see her walk up the stair
Walk up to his room and she said
"Hey baby, I think my job is to make love to you"
And he played his drums...
Yeah, yeah
A ha ha ha, you see, ah I gotta explain this to you
He didn't know she was coming, all right

[Verse 4]
Noel Redding also got a girl name Gloria
She looks something like an alley bad boy, ain't nothin' wrong with that
One time Noel was playing with himself
And she come knockin' on his door
And little Noel gonna take a solo on the bass, then
Showing that he appreciates her love
Even though she did look like home made sin
And her breath smelt like wet pussy
And while all that was happening
I looked out the window
And here comes the man with all the groovy grass
And here we are freakin' out man
You know we be gettin' into somethin' good
And we layin' back, freaking and smoking and joking
All a sudden, I hear the man coming
The man the cops they came in, oh, Lord, have mercy

[Chorus]
I said hey Gloria
I think it's time to get the hell outta here
I said Gloria get off my chest
It's time to get outta here
I'm talking about G-L-O-R-IIIIII-A, G-L-O-R-I-A. G-L-O-R-I-A
Yeah yeah, make me feel so good
Yeah, make me feel so good, baby
I'm talking about talkin' about, talkin' about, talkin' about Gloria!
Wa-hey!
I know perfectly well
I'm not where I should be
I've been very aware
You've been patient with me

Every time we break up
You bring back your love to me
And after all I've done to you
How can it be

You still believe in me

I try hard to be more
What you want me to be
But I can't help how I act
When you're not here with me

I try hard to be strong
But sometimes I fail myself
And after all I've promised you
So faithfully
You still believe in me

I wanna cry...

[Verse 1: David Ruffin]
When I had you here
I treated you bad, bad, bad, and wrong my dear
And since, since you went away
Don't you know I sit around with my head hanging down
And I, I wonder who's loving you

[Verse 2: David Ruffin]
I, I, I, I, I, I
I should have never, never made you cry
And since, little girl, since you've been gone, I want you to know
Don't you know I sit around with my head hanging down
And I, I wonder who's loving you
Listen

[Bridge: David Ruffin]
Life without love is oh so lonely
I don't think that I, I want you to go
Now I don't think that I'm gonna make it
All of my life (my life)
All my love (my love) belongs to you only
Come on home, girl, come on and take it

[Verse 3: David Ruffin]
Because I, all I could do
All I could do, baby, since you've been gone is cry
And if you, you, you, baby
Ever wonder and worry your pretty little head about what I do
Don't you know I sit around with my head hanging down
And I, I wonder, who's loving you

[Verse 1]
Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
And I say to myself, "You're such a lucky guy"
To have a girl like her
Is truly a dream come true
Out of all the fellas in the world
She belongs to you...

[Chorus]
But it was just my imagination
Running away with me
It was just my imagination
Running away with me...

[Verse 2]
(Soon) Soon we'll be married..
And raise a family (oh yeah)
In a cozy, little home out in the country
With two children, maybe three
I tell you I, I can visualize it all
This couldn't be a dream
For too real it all seems

[Chorus]
But it was just my imagination
(Once again)
Running away with me, yeah
I tell you it was
Just my imagination
Running away with me...

[Bridge]
Oh, every night, on my knees I pray
(Dear Lord) hear my plea
Don't ever let another
Take her love from me
Or I will surely die
Ooh, her love is heavenly
When her arms enfold me
I hear a tender rhapsody
But in reality
She doesn't really know me

[Chorus]
Just my imagination
Running away with me
Tell you it was just my imagination
Running away with me
(You don't even know my name)
Just my imagination
Running away with me
Just my imagination
Running away with me
(Running away with me, running, oh oh...)
Sleep all day, out all night
I know where you're goin'
I don't think that's acting right
You don't think it's showin'

Jumping up, falling down
Don't misunderstand me
You don't think I don't know your plan
What you tryin' to hand me

Out all night, sleep all day
I know what you're doin'
If you're gonna act that way
I think there's trouble brewin'

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
She believed in fairy tales and princes
He believed the voices coming from his stereo
He believed in rock and roll
She left her past and those lily-white fences
And headed out to Hollywood in search of her soul
But she had to pay the toll
Yes, she did

[Chorus]
They were bound to find each other
He needed proof, she needed a brother
That’s when stars collide
When there’s space for what you want
And your heart is open wide

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute
He gave up women for the stripes of the road
And learned the meaning of grace
That’s when his cup overflowed
Hmm
And she said: “Hello”
He said, “My faith keeps me from willin’
But you know that I’m able
And if there’s some room, I’d like to sit at your table”
She said “It’s tight, but I think I can fit you in”

[Chorus]
This kind of love don’t come from a prayer
Ain’t talking rebound, born of despair
Yellow sun rising on their bodies in bed
Two people in love
With nothing but the road ahead

[Bridge]
Ah yeah, oh ho
All right, hmm
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh
Let’s go
Mmm

[Verse 3]
She believed in fairy tales and princes
He believed in jazz, rhythm and blues, and this thing called soul
He believed in rock and roll
Hear me
She wanted to see her name appear on the big screen
He just wanted to hear her scream his name
Can you scream my name?
Do you know what I mean?
Hmm

[Chorus]
This kind of love don’t come from a prayer
Ain’t talking rebound, born of despair
Yellow sun rising on their bodies in bed
Two people in love with nothing but the road ahead

[Outro]
Rock, rock, love affair
Rock, rock, love affair
Rock, rock, love affair
Well, that's all right, mama
That's all right for you
That's all right mama, just anyway you do
Well, that's all right, that's all right
That's all right now mama, anyway you do

Well, mama she done told me
Papa done told me too
"Son, that gal you're foolin' with
She ain't no good for you"
But, that's all right, that's all right
That's all right now mama, anyway you do

I'm leaving town, baby
I'm leaving town for sure
Well, then you won't be bothered
With me hanging 'round your door
Well, that's all right, that's all right
That's all right now mama, anyway you do

[Skit: Keith B-Real & Will Smith]
Yeah, this is Keith B-Rizzeal
Uh, looks like this brother, Will Smith, is just avoidin' me
But I will not be ignored, you understand?
Uh-uh-uh, 'cuse me, uh, uh-uh Will, Will!
One more question, my brother
Look, I see you brought your DJ Jazzy Jeff with you now keep it real
Are you just flauntin' DJ Jazzy Jeff around for the cameras
So you don't look like some big time bougie Hollywood sell out that you really are?
Process that, along with your hair
Keith, Keith, Keith!
Yeah, I know, Charlie
Charlie, you gonna get enough of grabbin' up on me, man
Ain't no reason why I should feel this way
I got everything going for now
Might have it all, some people say

But each time I think of your smiling face
For I took upon inside now
In your sweet love I can take

'Cause I lost the best thing
I miss you more everyday
And I know deep inside me
No one can take your place, oh no

Sometimes when I am lonely
And I can feel your presence near
Well, I look at your picture
And your sweet voice I can often hear

But every time I really see you
Oh, my heart often smiles
And at that precise moment
I break up all inside
'Cause I lost the best thing
I miss you more everyday
And I know deep inside me
No one can take your place, oh no

Oh, all alone, I've lost you
T'was nothing you could do
I lost my only creation
And now I'm paying all the due

But every time I really see you
Oh, my heart often smiles
And at that precise moment
I break up all inside

'Cause I lost the best thing
I miss you more everyday
And I know deep inside me
No one can take your place, oh no
Lord, I've got to keep on moving
Lord, I've got to get on down
Lord, I've got to keep on moving
Where I can't be found
Lord, they're coming after me

I've been accused for the killin'
Lord knows I didn't do
For hangin' me, they are willin', yeah, yeah
And that's why I've got to get on thru
Lord, they're coming after me (a-one more time)

(I say) Lord, I've got to keep on moving
Lord, I've got to get on down
Lord, I've got to keep on moving
Where I can't be found
Lord, they're coming after me

(Now, listen) I've got two boys and a woman
They're just gonna suffer now
Lord, forgive me for not goin' back
But I'll be there anyhow
I'll be there anyhow (one more time)
(I say) Lord, I've got to keep on moving
Lord, I've got to get on down
Lord, I've got to keep on moving
Where I can't be found
Lord, they're coming after me

Now, maybe someday I'll find a piece of land
Somewhere not by near anyone
Then I'll send for my love, love, love, love, sweet woman
And my two grown up son
My two grown up son (yeah, yeah ...)

(I say now) Lord I've got to keep on moving ...
Angel you set em up right

Look at earth from outer space
Everyone must find the place
Give me time and give me space
Give me real, don't give me fake
Give me strength, reserve control
Give me heart and give me soul
Give me love, give us a kiss
Tell me your own politik
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Give me one 'cause one is best
And in confusion, confidence
Give me peace of mind and trust
And don't forget the rest of us
Give me strength, reserve control
Give me heart and give me soul
Wounds that heal and cracks that fix
My love, tell me your own politik
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
And give me love over, love over, love over this
Ahh, give me love over, love over, love over this
Ahh
Unconditional, unconditional
Unconditional, unconditional

Who else would let someone nail them to a cross
For the sake of others so they would not be lost
No one, No one, will go that far for us
Who else would let someone get away with so much wrong
But still extend them gret (**grace**)
No one, No one, have so much love for us

The kind of love he shows is unconditional
His love don't come and go it's unconditional

Who else but him
He's a constant friend
Even when others turn them backs against
No one, No one is always there for us
So what kind of love

So even when your closest friends and family give up on you
Theres not a day when you can't depend on him
If you find some error in the lyrics
Would you please submit your corrections to me?
One two three four
(When this began)
I had nothing to say
And I get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused)
And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me)
But all that they can see the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(Nothing too real)
Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own and the fault is my own
I wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real
I wanna let go off the pain I've felt so long
(Erase all the pain till it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong
And I've got nothing to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(I was confused)
Looking everywhere only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I?)
What do I have but negativity
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me
(Nothing to lose)
Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own
I wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real
I wanna let go off the pain I've felt so long
(Erase all the pain till it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong
And I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else until my wounds are healed
And I will never be anything till I break away from me
And I will break away, I'll find myself today
I wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real
I wanna let go off the pain I've felt so long
(Erase all the pain till it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I am somewhere I belong
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I am somewhere I belong
Somewhere I belong, yeah
I ain't never missed a woman
Anytime or anyhow
I ain't never missed a woman
Anytime or anyhow
I ain't never missed a woman
Oh, just like the way I miss my baby now
Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue
My disposition, it depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am so what can I do
I'm happy when I'm with you
Sometimes I am happy other times I am blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the sky
If I can find that sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's because I love you
That's how I am so what can I do
I'm happy, so happy when I'm with you

When I watched you walk with him
Tears filled my eyes
And when I heard you talk with him
I couldn't stand his lies
And now before he tries it
I hope you realize it

Let him run wild
He don't care
Let him run wild
He'll find out
Let him run wild
He don't care

(Guess you know I waited for you)
He'll do the same to other girls
That he did to you
But then one day he'll run in to one
That's gonna hurt him too
Before he makes you over
I'm gonna take you over
Let him run wild
He don't care
Let him run wild
He'll find out
Let him run wild
He don't care

(Guess you know I waited for you girl)
All the dreams you shared with him
You might as well forget
I know you need a truer love
And that's what you'll get
And now that you don't need him
Well he can have his freedom

Let him run wild
He don't care
Let him run wild
He'll find out
Let him run wild
He don't care
Let him run wild
He'll find out
Let him run wild
He don't care
Let him run wild
He'll find out
Let him run wild
The blazing sunset in your eyes will tantalize
Every man who looks your way
I'll watch them sink before your gaze
Señorita sway
Dance with me before their frozen eyes
I'm so much in love like a ragged soldier
Catching butterflies

No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too?

In the heat of the morning
In the shadows I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning

I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organise the breeze
Light my candle from the sun
I'll give you daylight for a friend, I'll do all of these
I'll prove that it can be done
Oh I'm so much in love like the little boy
Who races with the wind
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too?

In the heat of the morning
In the shadows I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning

Johnny Yuma was the rebel he roamed through the west
Yeah Johnny Yuma the rebel he wandered alone
He got fightin' mad this rebel lad he packed no star as he wandered far
Where the only law was a hook and a draw the rebel Johnny Yuma
Johnny Yuma was the rebel he roamed through the west
Yeah Johnny Yuma the rebel he wandered alone
He searched the land this restless lad he was panther quick and leather tough
Witht the figure that he's been pushed enough the rebel Johnny Yuma (Johnny Yuma)
Johnny Yuma was the rebel he roamed through the west
Yeah Johnny Yuma the rebel he wandered alone
Fightin' mad this rebel lad with the dreams he's hold till his dyin' breath
He searched his soul and gambled with death the rebel Johnny Yuma
(Away awayway he rode the Rebel Johnny Yuma Johnny Yuma)
Life is so good
Life is so good these days
Life is so good these days
Life is so good

Life is so good
Life is so good these days
Life is so good these days
Life is so good
Kevin Jones said, there's a bear in the woods
And if you don't believe it
Just ask Wesley Orbison and Lance Johnson
'cause they saw him, too
I was drivin' my jeep across the field
And when I came in to the edge of the woods
I saw Kevin Jones
Comin' down out of a tread
I stopped my jeep
And Kevin jumped up on the running board
And there it's when he said
There's a bear in the woods
And I looked right at Kevin
And I said, now Kevin, tell me the truth
And he looked at me right in the eye
He said, I'm not kiddin' you, Uncle John
He said, there's a bear in the woods
And if you don't believe it
Just ask Wesley Orbison and Lance Johnson
'cause they saw him, too
I kept on lookin' right at Kevin and I said
Now tell me truth, Kevin
He said, it is, it's a bear, it's a black bear
He said, it's not a big bear, but it's a bear
It's a black bear
I've seen him goin' down the trail there
I kept on lookin' at Kevin and I got to thinkin'
Now Kevin Jones said, there's a bear in the woods
Kevin was seven years old and I'm a lot older than he is
And I've done a lot of things that he hadn't done
And one of those things that I've done that he hadn't, is to lie
So I got to thinkin', if Kevin Jones says
There's a bear in the woods, who am I to doubt it
Well, I kind o' grinned at Kevin
And he jumped down off of the running board
And I started my jeep back up
And headed down the road in the woods
As I went away
I hollered back at Kevin and I said
Hey Kevin, watch out for that bear in the woods!
Well now it's three o'clock in the morning
And I can't even close my eyes
Three o'clock in the morning baby
And I can't even close my eyes
Can't find my baby
And I can't be satisfied

I've looked around me
And my baby she can't be found
I've looked all around me, people
And my baby she can't be found
You know if I don't find my baby
I'm going down to the Golden Ground
That's where the men hang out

Goodbye, everybody
I believe this is the end
Oh goodbye everybody
I believe this is the end
I want you to tell my baby
Tell her please please forgive me
Forgive me for my sins
Could have danced all night, Could have danced all night
And still have begged for more
I could have spread my wings, and done a thousand things
I've never done before

I'll never know what made it so exciting
Why all at once my heart took flight
I only know when she, began to dance with me
I could have danced, danced, danced, danced, danced all night

I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night
And still have danced some more
I could have spread my wings and done a thousand things
That Ive never done before

I'll never know what made it so, so exciting
Why all at once my heart took flight
I only know when she, began to dance with me
I could have danced, danced, danced, danced, danced all night
Wake up in the morning I don't feel blue
?Cause I know I got you
Get a funny feeling all day and night
I get the funny feeling you don't treat me right

Should have read your letters
And then I'd know
I would have felt much better
Because I know you love me so

Wake up in the morning I don't feel blue
?Cause I know I got you
Get a funny feeling all day and night
I get the funny feeling you don't treat me right

Should have read your letters
And then I'd know
I would have felt much better
Because I know you love me so
She sparkles like a diamond
Look at all her people
Look at them dance, look at them laugh
Singing a song
They make like happy children
Wearing friendly faces
Everyone knows, everyone knows they belong
Where they belong

Capetown, I'm drowning in your beauty
Capetown, but my hearts not feeling nicely
Capetown, angel black, white sin
Capetown, there's a shadow on your mountain
Capetown, there's a flaw in your sparkle
Capetown, there's a crying at your crossroads
Let me in, let me in, let me in

The rush of silky color
The sound of Dixie Banjos
Mongrel melodies in quarter tones
Streets of Malay marchers
Hatted in their feathers
The lilt, the lilt of xhosa Saxophones, xhosa saxophones
Capetown, there's a hole at the heart of you
A hole where district six used to be
Capetown, now brown ghosts are dancing
To be free, oh to be free
Capetown, there's an island in your ocean
Capetown, where black blood is running
Capetown, hear the voices calling from your sea
You belong to me, oh you belong to me, hmm

Tidy whitewashed houses
Sprays of wild flowers
The heart and soul of gentility
The vineyards, and the orchards
Warm white sandy beaches
Old and graceful luxury

Capetown, they're squatting in your desert
Capetown, in shanties made of plastic
Capetown exiles in your homeland
Capetown, struggling with your reason
Capetown, holding back your madness
Capetown, it's a bitter fruit you harvest
Capetown, oh, oh

Capetown I'm drowning in your beauty
Capetown, but my hearts not feeling nicely
Capetown, angel black, white as sin
Capetown there's a shadow on your mountain
Capetown, there's a flaw in your sparkle
Capetown, there's a crying at your crossroads
Let me in, let me in, let me in

Capetown, it's a bitter fruit you harvest
Capetown, let me in, ah let me in
Capetown you belong to me
Capetown you belong to me

Operation Doomsday
I let my heart fall into careless hands
Careless hands broke my heart in two
You held my dreams like worthless grains of sand
Careless hands don't care when dreams slip through
I brought you joy
And girl I loved you so
But all that sunshine didn't make the roses grow
If you don't change
Someday you'll know the sorrow of careless hands
That can't hold onto love
I let my heart fall into careless hands
Careless hands broke my heart in two
You held my dreams like worthless grains of sand
Careless hands don't care when dreams slip through
I brought you joy
And dear I loved you so
But all that sunshine didn't make the roses grow
If you don't change
Someday you'll know the sorrow of careless hands
That can't hold onto love
Careless hands that can't hold onto love
Talking 'bout those hands
That can't hold onto love
Talking 'bout those hands
That can't hold onto love
I let my heart fall into careless hands
Careless hands broke my heart in two
You held my dreams like worthless dreams

[Intro: Pitbull & (Vein)]
Vein! (Let's go)
Let's welcome everybody to Planet Pit
And show 'em what worldwide music is

[Chorus: Pitbull & Vein]
They call me Mr. Worldwide
Let's show 'em why they call me Mr. Worldwide
Why you think they call me Mr. Worldwide?
Let's show 'em why they call me Mr. Worldwide
Hold up, 'cause bitch, I'm worldwide

[Verse: Pitbull]
I-I-I-I'm involved in the music business
But the funny thing is half of these fools don't know music
Don't know business
Have no business in music, what is this?
I learned from the best, stayed away from the worst
Now I send off every verse in a hearse
Now that every day is 15th and the 1st
No more food stamps; church
These boys can't get past third base
They a bunch of MC's searchin'
I can care less and you can give
A fat baby's ass if they car's got curtains
They rap for the block, I speak to the globe
I got them models, they holla at them hoes
Better do your homework, papito
I took the 305 worldwide
I took the 305 worldwide

[Chorus: Pitbull & Vein]
Why you think they call me Mr. Worldwide?
Let's show 'em why they call me Mr. Worldwide
Why you think they call me Mr. Worldwide?
Let's show 'em why they call me Mr. Worldwide
Hold up, 'cause bitch, I'm worldwide
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger
You may see a stranger across a crowded room
And somehow you know, you know even then
That somewhere you'll see her again and again
Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room
And night after night, as strange as it seems
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams
Tell me who can explain it? Who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love
When you hear her call you across a crowded room
Then run to her side and make her your own
Or all through your life you may dream all alone
Once you have found her, never let her go
Once you have found her, never let her go
Never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger
You can hear her laughing, calling from across a crowded room
Who can explain it? Who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try, I'll never know
You better run to her side, let her know that you're alive
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
...
A time to swing a little melody
To make you all feel something sexually
And now we're gonna get it on in the groove
The groove that makes those smooth hips move
We are pumpin' that drivin' bad rythm
To make those pretty little pussy lips schism
Kissum kissum kissum
In the mind is one design to make you feel fine
Suckin' on mine with a 69
I'm inclined to funk, funk, funk, funk your brains out
For the moment, come on now, make her shout
Push it all in and pull it all out, pump that leman 'til it pouts
Open up your legs to the sensual sound
With the beauty of the beat on your pretty wet mound
I can tell you're like a horny bloodhound
Feel the bass, hug the ground
Just drop your knees and come unbound
And now you make your mouth to get on down
Our lust for notes will boil your blood
When they slither and slide on under your hood
Or makin' me shoot my power packed pud
Like a wild lady lovin' a viable stud
Because of what is know as a juicy wet pud
Gettin' it gettin' it gettin' it good
In my head, as a hellified hum
I take to rubbin' her on the bum
Adjust the lips some on the tongue
With my thumb I strum her plum
Start to make her orgasm
Tastes a little bit like, ooh, how rum
I like to make her come, to the rythm of the drums
Make her come, make her come, her come

[Verse 1: Nathan]
There was a time, when I thought life was over and out
When you went away from me
My dying heart made it hard to breathe
Would sit in my room because I didn't want to have to go out
And see you walking by
One look and I'd break right down and cry
Now you say that you made a big mistake
Never meant to take your love away
But you can save your tired apologies
Cause it may seem hard to believe, but I

[Chorus]
I'm doin' just fine, getting along very well
Without you in my life
I don't need you in my life
But I, I'm doin' just fine
Time made me stronger
You're no longer on my mind

[Verse 2: Shawn]
You were my earth, my number one priority
I gave my love to only you
Anything you'd ask of me, I would do
But somewhere down the road
You felt a change in the weather and told
Me that you had to journey on
A kiss in the wind and your love was gone, all gone
Now you say you never meant to play your games
But girl don't you know it's far too late
Because you let our love just fall apart
You no longer have my heart

[Chorus]
I'm doin' just fine
Getting along very well without you in my life
I don't need you in my life
But I, I'm doin' just fine
Time made me stronger
You're no longer on my mind
I don't need you anymore

[Verse 3: Wanya]
When you said goodbye, I felt so all alone
There were times at night I couldn't sleep
My heart was much too weak to make it on my own
Baby after all the misery and pain you put me through
So unfair to me girl, you're no longer my world
And I ain't missin' you at all

[Chorus]
I'm fine, (I'm doin' just fine baby)
Getting along very well
Without you in my life
I don't need you in my life
I'm fine (said I'm doin' just fine)
Time made me stronger
You're no longer on my mind

[Outro]
See, baby when you walked away
(I'm doing just fine)
You didn't think it would end up this way
(getting along very well without you in my life)
But I knew you'd be coming 'round someday
(I don't need you in my life)
Just as sure as my name is Wanya
Said I'm, I'm doin' just fine
Time made me stronger your no longer on my mind
All the fellas roll a fat blunt and
Smoke some green, smoke some green, smoke some (green)
All the ladies rub on your cunt and
Smoke some green, smoke some green, smoke some (green) x2

Because I got high in this bitch
You can't see my burgundy eye in this bitch
T burg Mississippi p-dale in this bitch
T-shirt, cds for sell in this bitch
Inhale and get high, my my my
You need to give beer and marijuana a try
I ride thirteens and hit the three will switch
I'm from Eastside Palmdale Cali, Biaatch
Hungry Hustler records with the marijuana leaf
Still pimpin' poor bitchs even though we got beef
Get an ounce, Get an ounce
Now I'm about to smoke some green
Flick my ashes, drink my glasses, and I keep my clothes clean
Two or three hoes wanna pose with Afroman
Marijuana, malt liquor, butt cheeks in my hand
Real women groping me
Cheater haters scoping me
Cops know I got some liquor plus I got some dope on me
All the fellas roll a fat blunt and
Smoke some green, smoke some green, smoke some (green)
All the ladies rub on your cunt and
Smoke some green, smoke some green, smoke some (green) x2

First my head start ta spin then my beer cup falls
Falls on all y'all. Oh shit ah nah
Started slapping hoe bitch
Took that bitch to berlin
Told that bitch to suck my dick till' the fucking world ends
All my homies got some bitches
All them bitches bring me riches
Put them riches in my britches
Leave them bitches in some ditches
Beers, blunts, bag of weed
Everything a brother need
No stems no seeds roll it up with speed
Palmdale cali anti-dope alley
So much weed my house look like a galley
I'm never on MTV, I'm never on BET
I talk too much about W-EED
Love me a sugar bear, great big derriere
Real long pretty hair, marijuana everywhere
Ride cross country, smokin' in the country
At the waffle house *chicken* I got the muchies
All the fellas roll a fat blunt and
Smoke some green, smoke some green, smoke some (green)
All the ladies rub on your cunt and
Smoke some green, smoke some green, smoke some (green) x2

[Verse 1]
Words are floating through the windows
And in the house, she blows them away
Faded in the morning time

[Verse 2]
Haters with their hearts asunder
Will ruin our parade
Faded in the morning time

[Verse 3]
Walking through the winter markets
And all the horses floated away
Faded in the morning time

[Verse 4]
Sun is rising, stings my eyes
And don't wanna die today
Jaded in the morning time

[Verse 1]
Words are floating through the windows
And in the house, she blows them away
Faded in the morning time

[Verse 2]
Haters with their hearts asunder
Will ruin our parade
Faded in the morning time

[Verse 3]
Walking through the winter markets
And all the horses floated away
Faded in the morning time

[Verse 4]
Sun is rising, stings my eyes
And don't wanna die today
Jaded in the morning time
I know how i feel
Lonely in the black of night
There can be no love for me now
Nobody listens when the words ain't right
And you get into someone else
It's hard for me to know
Who's lovin' who
And where do i stand
What did i do it all for
There's no one i could love more
I did it for your heart alone
All that i try to be growin' inside to me
I can be strong if you're there

And there is someone belonging to someone
And i got no one belonging to me
I live in a world where the face of an angel
Is all that a fool can see
You got the power to find me whenever i'm lost
Where are you ? who are we?
I believe in time
Can eat away a heart of stone
And baby if i leave you too late
It's just a feather and the bird has flown
It's colder when the fire dies
With all the trouble i'm in if i lose you too

Then what is my life
If i don't wanna go through
Anything without you
Couldn't be life at all
I could be lyin' on
You are the only one
We didn't make it by chance
And there is someone
Belonging to someone
And i got no one belonging to me
I'm caught in a world on
The edge of tomorrow
It's all that a fool can find
I don't belong in the arms
Of a love that is lost
Nowhere to cry
There must be something we
Can say my love
Something except goodbye
And there is someone belonging to someone
And i got no one belonging to me

Repeat above

[Verse 1]
Comparisons are easily done
Once you've had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I picked the ripest one
I still got the seed

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You said move on, where do I go?
I guess second best is all I will know

[Chorus 1]
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes

[Verse 2]
You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter
Like a hard candy with a surprise center
How do I get better once I've had the best?
You said there's tons of fish in the water
So the waters I will test

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He kissed my lips, I taste your mouth, oh
He pulled me in, I was disgusted with myself

[Chorus 1]
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into...

[Bridge]
You're the best
And yes, I do regret
How I could let myself let you go
Now the lesson's learned
I touched it, I was burned
Oh, I think you should know

[Breakdown]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
What you would do if...

[Chorus 2]
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Won't you walk through
And bust in the door and take me away?
Yeah, no more mistakes
'Cause in your eyes I want to stay

[Outro]
Oh-oh, woah-oh, woah
Stay

[Verse 1]
I can hear my baby saying my name
But I don't see my baby in time
Without you in here, it ain't the same
I didn't mean word I said to you last night

[Pre-Chorus]
If you decide to pick up the phone, oh baby
I'll be waiting for you
Tell me what's wrong, I didn't mean to ignore you
Don't quit me baby I can fix it baby
Being by myself is now my biggest fear

[Chorus]
Cause I want you here when I come back
(There ain't nothin' I look more forward to than that)
And I want you here when I come home
(Cause I can't stand to be alone, you gotta be here)
When I come back (x4)

[Verse 2]
I can hear you telling to come home
But you may not even be there
We not gon' make it if I'm always gone
Plus you told me you ain't going anywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
If you decide to pick up the phone, oh baby
I'll be waiting for you
Tell me what's wrong, I didn't mean to ignore you
Don't quit me baby I can fix it baby
Being by myself is now my biggest fear

[Chorus]
Cause I want you here when I come back
(There ain't nothin' I look more forward to than that)
And I want you here when I come home
(Cause I can't stand to be alone, you gotta be here)
When I come back (x4)
Hey, Hey, Hey Come on in baby (Hey Baby)

The warden led the prisoner down the hallway to his doom
I stood up to say goodbye like all the rest
And I heard him tell the warden just before they reached my cell
Let my guitar playin' friend fill my request
Let him sing me back home a song I used to hear. Make my old memories come alive
Sing me away and turn back the year. Sing me home before I die
I recall last Sunday morning when the choir from off the street
Came in to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers there's a song my mother sang
Can I hear it before you travel on
Sing me back home a song I used to hear. Make my old memories come alive
Sing me away and turn back the year. Sing me back home before I die
She told me she'd been loved before
If I took a little less
She'd give a little more
She told me she'd been hurt a lot
But somehow she still knew
What a woman's love was for

She said if I would take a second-hand woman
The night wouldn't be so long
She said if I would take a second-hand woman
She'd put love where love belonged

I said that's alright with me
I'll do everything I can
After all baby I'm a second-hand man

I showed her Where I hid the scars
From all the battles I had fought
In lost and lonely wars
It took al night for us to understand
Life had led to us
Loves old soft and healing hand
Hey, you say you won't you can't give me any more love

But girl, I got to have you for myself
So, I'm gonna keep on trying, just keep on trying till I win your love, woo
Gonna keep on trying, just keep on trying till I win your love, woo
A fallen star that's what you are, from the heavens above

Sentimental baby, sweet and gentle baby
Just the way a baby oughta be
Heaven in the morning, heaven in the evening
How did such an angel get to me?

Cuddle and caress me, snuggle up and "Yes" me
I'm a guy who loves a clinging vine
Kiss me, baby, kiss me and then
Do it, baby, over again
Sentimental baby, tell me you're my baby
Sentimental baby of mine

Instrumental-first line of second verse
I'm a guy who loves a clinging vine
Kiss me, baby, kiss me and then
Do it, baby, all over again
Sentimental baby, tell me you're my baby
Sentimental baby of mine
Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah

All because I wanna hold you tight
(To hold you tight)
But every time I reach for you, baby
And try to kiss you, you're just jumping out of sight
(Out of sight)
Oh, I've got news for you
Baby, that I've made plans for two

Got my mind made up to love you
Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah

With you I'll share each day
(I'll stay by your side)
Now I know you've heard about me
Bad things about me, baby, please let me explain
(Don't you listen to that jive)
Oh, I have kissed a few
I tell you, a few have kissed me too
I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up to love you

[Repeat and fade:]
Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah
I've known her valleys, I've known her mountains
Her missions and her courtyards and her fountains
The giant redwoods towering in the skies of her
That grow as though as they know they show the size of her

I've often wandered her farthest reaches
Her deserts and her snow and, yes, her beaches
A land that paradise could well be jealous of
That's California, California, blessed by heaven from above
That's California, land I love

(I've known her valleys, I've known her mountains)
(Her missions and her courtyards and her fountains)
(The giant redwoods towering in the skies of her)
(That grow as though as they know they show the size of her)

I've often wandered her farthest reaches
Her deserts and her snows and, yes, her beaches
A land that paradise could well be jealous of
That's California, California, bless'd by heaven from above
That's California, the land I love
Evening shadows make me blue when each weary day is through
How I long to be with you, my happiness
Everyday I reminisce, dreaming of your tender kiss
Always thinking how I miss my happiness
A million years it seems, have gone by since we shared our dreams
But I'll hold you again, there'll be no blue memories then
Whether skies are gray or blue, any place on earth will do
Just as long as I'm with you, my happiness
Hey, hey, everybody!

What a wonderful, wonderful world this would be
What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world

Don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about a science book
Don't know much about the French I took
(But I do know)
But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me, too
What a wonderful, wonderful world this would be

Don't know much about geography
Don't know much trigonometry
Don't know much about algebra
I don't know what a slide rule is for
(But I do know)
But I do know "one and one is two"
And if this one could be with you
(A wonderful world)
What a wonderful, wonderful world this would be
What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world

Now I don't claim to be an 'A' student
But I'm tryin' to be
I think that maybe by bein' an 'A'-student, baby-baby
I could win your love for me

Don't know much about the Middle Ages
Looked at the pictures then I turned the pages
Don't know nothin' 'bout no "Rise and fall"
Don't know nothin' 'bout nothin' at all
(But I do know)
Girl it's you that I've been thinkin' of
And if I could only win your love (oh girl)
What a wonderful, (what a) wonderful world this would be
What a wonderful, wonderful world this would be

What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world
What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world
You and me, we wanted it all we wanted it all
Passion without pain, sunshine without rainy days
We wanted it always

You and me, we reached for the sky, the limit was high
Never giving in, certain we could win that prize
I should have seen it in your eyes

Look how all our dreams came true
See how I've got me and, baby, you've got you
Through it all, just one thing died
A little thing called love, something deep inside

You and me, we're not like the rest, we once were the best
Back when we were dumb, how did we become so smart
And learn to break each other's heart?

Look how all our dreams came true
See how I've got me, baby, you've got you
Through it all, just one thing died
A little thing called love, something deep inside
You and me, we're not like the rest, we once were the best
But look what we became, isn't it a cryin' shame
That we almost made it?

But we wanted it all
Baby, you and me
We wanted it all

Mm., mm , mm
There's a Red House over yonder
That's where my baby stays
There's a Red House over yonder, baby
That's where my baby stays

Well, I ain't been home to see my baby
In ninety nine and one half days
'Bout time I see her
Wait a minute something's wrong here
The key won't unlock the door

Wait a minute something's wrong baby
Lord, have mercy, this key won't unlock this door
Something's goin' on here
I have a bad bad feeling that my baby don't live here no more

That's all right, I still got my guitar
Look out now...

I might as well go on back down
Go back 'cross yonder over the hill
I might as well go back over yonder
Way back over yonder 'cross the hill
That's where I came from
'Cause if my baby don't love me no more
I know her sister will
I guess I'll have to change my plan
I should have realized there'd be another man
I overlooked that point completely
Until the big affair began

Before I knew where I was at
I found myself upon the shelf and that was that
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there
All that I could get was the air

My feet are back upon the ground
I lost the one girl I'd found

Before I knew where I was at
I found myself upon the shelf and that was that
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there
All that I could get was the air

My feet are back upon the ground
I lost the one girl
The one girl I'd found
My boiling point is much too low
For me to try to be a fly Lothario
Writer(s): Howard

I've seen that face before
That face that I see in the mirror
I know that face
I've seen that face before

I knew that dopey guy
When he didn't know how to tie his tie
He stood right there and he had hair galore

The man in the looking glass
Who can he be
The man in the looking glass
Can he possibly be me

Where's our young romeo
The lad who used to sigh
Who's the middle age lothario
With the twinkle in his eye
He seem so much wiser now
Less lonely but then
Could be he's only pretending again
Man in the looking glass smiling away
How's your sacroiliac today

Where's your first love affair
That trajedy d'amour
The true love you thought would be
The end of you for sure

The man in the looking glass
Have no regrets
The man who's wise never forgets
That life is worth living if once in a while
You can look in that looking glass and smile

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks]
You, you need a love like mine that you can depend on
When your whole world's falling in
When you need a friend, you can depend on me
You can depend on me

[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks]
I'll be by your side
When you need me
When the whole world seems unfair
And no one seems to care
You can depend on me
You can depend on me

[Bridge: Eddie Kendricks]
When life seems not worth living
And nothing seems to be going right
The comfort my love will be giving, giving
Will change your darkness to light

[Verse 3: Eddie Kendricks]
I, I, I, I, I'll be by your side
When you need me
When the whole seems unfair
And no one seems to care
You can depend on me
Ooh, you know you can depend on me
Yeah, yeah
You can depend on me
Yeah, yeah, every day
Where are you (where are you)
Night is day and day is night
Where are you (where are you)
Need you girl you re not in sight
Our love would grow, but you leave and I know
That you don't love me (where are you)
I need you girl, you're not in sight
I told you (I told you)
I was never coming back -ah
You told me (You told me)
You would give my love the sack-ah
Now as I fly, you won't tell me goodbye
Cause you don't love me (where are you)

Now you give my love the sack-ah
Now as my heart lies in pieces of eight
You were a part of my love but too late
I love you (I love you)
This I think that you should know
I' ll be blue (I'll be blue)
You are still cause I must
I'd like to stay but I know you won't play
And see things my way (where are you)
You are still cause I must go
You are still cause I must
I must go (where are you)
Don't go changing to try and please me
You never let me down before
Don't imagine you're too familiar
And I don't see you anymore

I would not leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far
I took the good times, I'll take the bad times
I'll take you just the way you are

Don't go trying some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair
You always have my unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care

I don't want clever conversation
I never want to work that hard
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are

I need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
What will it take till you believe in me
The way that I believe in you
I said I love you and that's forever
And this I promise from the heart
I could not love you any better
I love you just the way you are

I don't want clever conversation
I never want to work that hard
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are
She's a ghetto woman, waitin for her man to come home
Oh poor ghetto woman waitin for her man to come home
She's just a ghetto woman waitin for her man to come home
To come home

A rat run cross the floor, a roach turn up the wall
Everything is noisy around her, that don't seem to bother her at all
Cause she's a ghetto woman, sittin there all alone
She's just a ghetto woman waitin for her man to come home
To come home

Yes, the tv's on, radio blastin' the news
Somebody down the hall, playin the low down dirty blues
My ghetto woman, she's all alone
She's just a ghetto woman, waitin for her man to come home
To come home

Cause she's a ghetto woman, said she's a ghetto woman
Oh, ghetto woman, what's on your mind
Sometimes I look in your face, can't help but cry
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!
Would you please welcome Columbia recording artist Bob Dylan

Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me
Must have been the hand of the lord

While I was praying, somebody touched me
While I was praying, somebody touched me
While I was praying, somebody touched me
Must have been the hand of the lord

Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me
Must have been the hand of the lord

Well, it was on a Sunday, somebody touched me
It was on a Sunday, somebody touched me
It was on a Sunday, somebody touched me
Must have been the hand of the lord
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me
Must have been the hand of the lord

Hey, the shark has pretty teeth, dear
And it shows them pearly white
Just a jackknife has Mac Heath, dear
And he keeps it, way out of sight
When that shark bites with his teeth, dear
Scarlet billows they begin to spread
Fancy white gloves, has Mac Heath, dear
So there's never, never a trace of red

On the sidewalk, one Sunday morning
Lies a body, oozing' life
Someone's sneaking', 'round that corner
Could that someone perhaps per chance be Mack the Knife?

From the tugboat, on a river going slow
A cement bag's dropping down
You know, that cement is for the weight, dear
You can make a large bet that bums in town

JIMMY:
(Yeah he's in town)
FRANK:
My man Louie Miller
He split the scene babe
After drawing' out all the bread from his stash
Now Mac Heath spends like a sailor
Do you suppose this guy he did something rash?

Old Satchmo, Louie Armstrong, Bobby Daron
They did this song nice, Lady Ella too
They all sang it, with so much feeling
That old blue eyes here ain't gonna add anything new

JIMMY:
(oh yes you do)

FRANK:
But with this big, fat, band jumping behind me
Swinging hard Jack

JIMMY:
(That's Jimmy)
FRANK:
I know I can't loose, When I tell you
All about Mack the Knife, babe
It's an offer you can never refuse
We've got Patrick William
Bill Miller playin' that piano
And this wonderful, great, big, band
Bringin' up the rear
All these bad cats, in this bad town
They make the greatest sound you ever gonna hear

Oh Sukey Tawdry
JIMMY:
(Oh Sukey Tawdry)

FRANK:
Jenny Diver
JIMMY:

FRANK:
Polly Peaches

JIMMY:

FRANK:
Ms Lulu Brown
Yeah, the line forms on the right, dear
Now that Mack he
JIMMY:
(Oh Mack he)

FRANK:
Yeah that bum is back

JIMMY:
(Oh that bum he's back)

FRANK:
And I'm gonna tell you
What I think that you should know

JIMMY:
(What should I do)

FRANK:
You better lock your door
And call the law
Because Mack he
He's come back to town

Get under the bed hide

JIMMY:
(Look out old Mack is back)
New York I love you
But you're bringing me down
New York I love you
But you're bringing me down
Like a rat in a cage
Hauling minimum wage
New York I love you
But you're bringing me down
New York you're safer
And you're wasting my time
Our records all show
You are filthy but fine
But they shuttered your stars
When you opened the doors
To the cops who were bored
Once they'de run out of crime
New York you're perfect
Oh please don't change a thing
Your mild billionaire mayor's now convinced he's a king
So the boring collect
I mean all disrespect
In the neighbourhood bars I once dreamt i would drink
New York I love you
But you're freaking me out
There's a ton of the tiwst
But we're fresh out of shout
Like a death in the hall
That you hear through your wall
New York I love you
But you're freaking me out
New York I love you
But you're bringing me down
New York I love you
But you're bringing me down
Like a death of the heart
Jesus, where do I start
But you're still the one pool where I'd happily drown...
And oh! Take me off your mailing list
For kids who think it still exists
Yes, for those who think it still exists
Maybe I'm wrong
And maybe you're right
Maybe I'm wrong and maybe you're right
Maybe you're right
Maybe I'm wrong
And just maybe you're right...
And ohhhh
Maybe mother told you true
And there'll always be somebody there for you
And you'll never be alone
But maybe she's wrong
And maybe I'm right
And just maybe she's wrong...
Maybe she's wrong
And maybe I'm right
And if so, here's this song!
Here is a special bulletin
Ma Baker is the FBI's most wanted woman
Her photo is hanging on every post office wall
If you have any information about this woman
Please contact the nearest police station

She was the meanest cat
In old Chicago town
The meanest cat
She really moved them down
She had no heart at all
No, no, she had no heart at all

(Ma-Ma-Ma-Ma, Ma Baker)
She taught her hardened sons
(Ma-Ma-Ma-Ma, Ma Baker)
No one could argue with the guns
And she could never ever cry
But she knew better how to die
(Ma Baker)
She left a trail of crime
Across the USA
And when one boy was killed
She really made them pay
She didn't care at all
Oh no, she didn't care at all

(Ma-Ma-Ma-Ma, Ma Baker)
She taught her hardened sons
(Ma-Ma-Ma-Ma, Ma Baker)
No one could argue with the guns
And she could never ever cry
But she knew better how to die

(Freeze)
Here is a special bulletin
Ma Baker is the FBI's most wanted woman
(I'm Ma Baker)
If you have any information about
(Ma Baker)
Please contact the nearest police station

But she knew better how to die

[Intro]
2004
Still at war
And everybody hates Americans
Let's go

[Verse 1]
Flyin' in an aero-plane with pen in hand
Over miles and miles of deep blue
Wonderin' if it was all part of a master plan
Forget the one and become two
How could your brother hear the same music?
(Music, music, music)
Yet somehow dance to a different tune
I guess that once you go divide this precious land
This precious land will divide you
Sing!

[Chorus]
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Everybody stop fighting
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Everybody make love

[Verse 2]
Drivin' a brand new Cadillac through my neighborhood
Everything still look the same, uh
Everything except the fact I wish I could
Take away all the hurt and pain
We let Supafly straighten up our curly hair
He took the Afro out the game
It's kinda cool but the guns and drugs too much to bear
Ten years later Scarface came
Sing the hook

[Chorus]
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Everybody stop fighting
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Everybody make love

[Bridge]
A united state of mind will never be divided
The real definition of unity is one
People can slam their door, disagree and fight it
But how you gonna love the Father but not love the Son
United States of Division
Walkin' down the street
No flag in hand
No stars and stripes
No claim to land
No crescent moon
Just a holy man, holy man

How far from heaven must we go?
Before the winds of change will blow and show
This world how it's supposed to be, land of peace and harmony

Everybody stop fighting
Everybody make love
Everybody stop fighting
United States of Division

People can slam their door, disagree and fight it
But how you gonna say you love the Father and not love the Son?

United States of Division
BLACK (Division)
WHITE (Division)
STRAIGHT (Division)
GAY (Division)
CHRISTIAN (Division)
MUSLIM
Why must I say "God Bless America"?
And not the rest of the world
Oh say can you see?
I love my country but I love God more
Every man, women, boy and girl

Oooh, can you say it with me?

Doo doo doo doo doo doo, come on
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, everybody
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, oh
Everybody stop fighting! Put your gun down
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, hey
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, everybody gather round
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Everybody make Love!

Doo doo doo doo doo doo, oow

Talkin' 2 United States, United States, United States of Division!

Everybody make love
It's funny how you sound as if you're right next door
When you're really half a world away
I just can't seem to find the words I'm looking for
To say the things that I want to say
I can't remember when I felt so close to you
It's almost more than I can bear
And though I seem a half a million miles from you
You are in my heart and living there

And the moon and the stars are the same ones you see
It's the same old sun up in the sky
And your voice in my ear is like heaven to me
Like the breezes here in old Shanghai

There are lovers who walk hand in hand in the park
And lovers who walk all alone
There are lovers who lie unafraid in the dark
And lovers who long for home
Oh, I couldn't leave you even if I wanted to
You're in my dreams and always near
And especially when I sing the songs I wrote for you
You are in my heart and living there
And the moon and the stars are the same ones we see
It's the same old sun up in the sky
And your face in my dreams is like heaven to me
Like the breezes here in old Shanghai

Shanghai breezes, cool and clearing, evening's sweet caress
Shanghai breezes, soft and gentle, remind me of your tenderness

And the moon and the stars are the same ones we see
It's the same old sun up in the sky
And your love in my life is like heaven to me
Like the breezes here in old Shanghai

And the moon and the stars are the same ones we see
It's the same old sun up in the sky
And your love in my life is like heaven to me
Like the breezes here in old Shanghai

Just like the breezes here in old Shanghai
If you wanna live
Treat me good
If you wanna live, and live, and live
Treat me good

I'm like a walkin' razor
Don't watch my size, I'm dangerous
I'm like a walkin' razor
Don't watch my size, I'm dangerous

If you are a bully
I beg you look for me good
If you are a bully, a folly, a bully
Treat me good

I'm like a steppin' razor
Don't watch my size, I'm dangerous
I'm like a steppin' razor
Don't watch my size, I'm dangerous

You are a bully
Treat me good
If you are a bully, a bully, a bully
Look for me good
I'm like a walkin' razor
Don't watch my size, I'm dangerous
I'm like a walkin' razor
Don't watch my size, I'm dangerous

[Incomprehensible]
I beg you look for me good
Be quiet
I beg you treat me good

I'm like a stepin' razor
Don't watch my size, I'm dangerous
I'm like a stepin' razor
Don't watch my size, I'm dangerous
Oh there's nothing to be ashamed of
If you stub your toe on the moon
When the dream's at the top of the sky
Well, you'll just have to jump pretty high
But don't give up too soon
If you stub your toe on the moon
Now young Harry Hodgett loved making gadgets
Life needs some new things was his claim
Hope one or two things might bring fame
This is the last time you'll hear his name
Nobody mentions Harry's inventions
But do you think that got him down?
Here comes the end when there're gadgets to mend
He's the best repairman in town
So there's nothing to be ashamed of
If you stub your toe on the moon
When you start out to climb to a cloud
Well, it may get a laugh from the crowd
But don't give up too soon
If you stub your toe on the moon
Sweet Sally Springer, she was a singer
Lived in a hall room up one flight
Thought of the ballroom big and bright
Where she would make her debut some night
And then for her trouble, pop went the bubble
Say that it's sad, but wait, don't weep
Now they admit, every night she's a hit
When she sings her children to sleep
No, there's nothing to be ashamed of
If you stub your toe on the moon
Though it may be a blow to your pride
You're a hero because, well, you tried
So don't give up too soon
If you stub your toe on the moon
If you stub your toe on the moon
Oh Brother I Can't, I Can't Get Through
I've Been Trying Hard To Reach You 'Cause I Don't Know What To Do
Oh Brother I Can't Believe It's True
I'm So Scared About The Future And I Wanna Talk To You

Something That's Never Been Done, Do

Barbie, Barbie, queen of the crew
Turned down dates with Eddie and Todd
Everyone loves her, she's lovely to see
But Barbie, my Barbie, she loves only me

Barbie, Barbie, still in her teens
Bell of the parties, a tom boy in jeans
She's everything that a girl wants to be
And Barbie, my Barbie, she loves only me

This is a year, we have prayed for
This is a moment sublime
All of our lives we have waited for
For this one perfect time

Barbie, Barbie, always I knew
Can come here for one moment with you
Everyone loves you and everyone knows
That Barbie, my Barbie, you love only me

You love only me
You love only me
You love only me
Outside my window a robin builds a nest
At last winter's gone away to rest
Once again the leaves has return to the trees
I can just feel that soft summer breeze
There's magic in the air
Winter disappear, it's summer
Children will be playing in the park
Days will be longer till the dark
Nights will be warm with star filled skies
A perfect setting for a girl and a guy
There's magic in the air
Green grass every-everywhere
It's summer

[Instrumental]
Don't you know it's summer time... (Time) (Time) (Time)
And the livin' is easy. Oh, so easy
Everybody sing summer time... (Time) (Time) (Time)
Now that summer's here there be million things to do
Vacation near or far, whatever pleases you
Melvin: Summer is the happiest season of them all
So everybody get together and have yourselves a ball
There's magic in the air
Green grass every-everywhere
It's summer
Oh
There's magic in the air
Green grass every-everywhere
It's summer
Woo
It's summer time. (Magic in the air, green grass everywhere)
Oh, it's summer
Take a look around you
It's summer time. (Magic in the air, green grass everywhere)
Oh, it's summer
Hmm
It's summer time
Drunk girls (x4)

(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls cause a couple of heart attacks
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls are unusually mild
(Drunk boys)
Drunk boys keep in pace with the pedophiles
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls are boringly wild

(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls get invitations from nations
(Drunk girls)
They got the patience of a million saints
(Drunk boys)
They steal, they steal from the cupboards
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls like to file complaints

(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls are like a night of simplicity
(Drunk girls)
They need a lover who is smarter than me
(Drunk boys)
Drunk boys, we walk like pedestrians
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls wait an hour to pee
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls know that love is an astronaut
(Drunk girls)
It comes back, but it's never the same
(Drunk boys)
Drunk boys, drunk boys, drunk boys, drunk boys
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls can be just as insane

Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
So oh oh
That means making eyes across the room

(Drunk girls)
Just 'cause I'm shallow doesn't mean that I'm heartless
(Drunk girls)
Just 'cause I'm heartless doesn't mean that I'm mean
(Drunk boys)
Sometimes love gives us too many options
(Drunk girls)
Just 'cause you're hungry doesn't mean that you're lean

(Drunk girls)
I've heard lies that could curdle your heartstrings
(Drunk girls)
A couple truths, maybe burn out your eyes
(Drunk boys)
Drunk boys leave their irons in the fireplace
(Drunk girls)
'Cause drunk girls give them too many tries
Drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls...

Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
Oh oh oh
I believe I'm waking up, but no promises
Oh oh oh
I believe in waiting out the weather
Oh oh oh
I believe in making up

The day becomes the night (x4)
Honestly, honestly, honestly
Unless it hurts, why do it?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Oh
Girl, you're my sunshine
You chase away the raindrops
Make it all worthwhile
Make all the pain stop
Just like a river you keep love flowing
Don't let our world stop, keep it growing

Oh I like you just the way you are
Honey, don't change on me
Don't change on me
Please don't change on me
Girl, you're my lucky star
Don't change on me
Don't change on me
Please don't ever change

I used to wonder where would I find
Some kind of happiness and peace of mind
I was living in darkness
Oh but then you came
Bringing in the sunlight
And easing my pain
Oh I like you just the way you are
Honey, don't change on me
Don't change on me
Please don't change on me
Girl, you're my lucky star
Don't change on me
Don't change on me
Please don't ever change

If there's a heaven
Then this is my prayer
Lord knows I want to know you
If we ever should meet there
And then forever we'll walk together
Nothing but sunshine
And no more stormy weather

Oh I like you just the way you are
Honey, don't change on me
Don't change on me
Please don't change on me
Girl, you're my lucky star
Don't change on me
Don't change on me
Please don't ever change

[Verse 1]
Back in black, I hit the sack
I've been too long, I'm glad to be back
Yes, I am let loose from the noose
That's kept me hanging about
I've been looking at the sky
'Cause it's gettin' me high
Forget the hearse 'cause I never die
I've got nine lives, cat's eyes
Abusin' every one of them
And running wild

[Chorus]
Yes, I'm back
Oh, yes, I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Back in black

[Verse 2]
Back in the back of a cadillac
Number one with a bullet
I'm a power pack
Yes, I'm in a bang with a gang
They've got to catch me
If they want me to hang
'Cause I'm back on the track
And I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
Just look at me now
Just makin' my play
Don't try to push your luck
Just get out of my way

[Chorus]
Yes, I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Back in black
'Cause I'm back in black

Back in black
Yes, I'm back in black

Back in black
Yes, I'm back in black
Just let me hear some of that Rock 'n' Roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be Rock 'n' Roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I have no kick against modern Jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until it sounds just like a Symphony
That's why I go for that Rock 'n' Roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be Rock 'n' Roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she could her my man a-whalin' sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man they were goin' like a hurricane
That's why I go for that Rock 'n' Roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be Rock 'n' Roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Way down South they gave a Jubilee
I tell you folks they had a Jamboree
And drinkin' home, brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancin' got all shook up
They started playin' that Rock 'n' Roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be Rock 'n' Roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Say if you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
A Speedy Car
I don't know where
The Cameras are everywhere

Across the road
Onto the sand?
Every class has little girls?
I met you once before the first time
Cinema 1 or 2, I noticed you
Standing in line, your eyes met mine
And I could not look away

There we were, in a perfect moment
A perfect moment in time
For a moment, you were mine

So later on I knew the first time
That it would be alright for us that night
Trust in our eyes, we made a bridge of sighs
When we crossed over it was day

There we were, in a perfect moment
A perfect moment in time
For a moment, you were mine

I wasn't ready for the last time
But wasn't I supposed to let you go into the blue?
But still I'm holding you
Though you're a million miles away
There we were, in a perfect moment
A perfect moment in time
For a moment, you were mine

In a perfect moment
A perfect moment in time
For the moment, you are mine
For a moment, you are mine
Just for a moment, you were mine
I didn't know what time it was, then I met you
Oh what a lovely time it was, how sublime it was too!
I didn't know what day it was, you held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was and I'll say it was grand
Grand to be alive, to be young, to be mad, to be yours alone!
Grand to see your face, feel your touch, hear your voice say I'm all your own!
I didn't know what year it was, life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was shining out of your eyes
I'm wise and I know what time it is now

[Infatuation: Playa, Girl]

You ain't comin' in? BOY STOP
You're still the best person I ever knew
There were a thousand little things
That I was always just about to
Say to you
But now the time it grows shorter
For the speeches;
Let me leave you with a line-

Might help you pass the time...
Sometime
You might as well smile
Ain't no tears gonna drown the rain
Keeps on falling
You might as well smile
Ain't no pain gonna change what
Still remains
You might as well maintain, babe
Protect your sanity, your sanity, and
Shine it on, babe. Shine It On Me

I remember times when you'd touch me
And you'd, you'd freeze my spine
We were looking in the mirror at the time
I got confused and thought your eyes were mine
Might help you pass the time... sometime
You might as well smile
Ain't no tears gonna drown the rain
Keeps on falling
You might as well smile
Ain't no pain gonna change what
Still remains
You might as well regain, babe
Your lost serenity, serenity, and
Shine it on, babe. Shine It On Me
Glass house, that once was mine, the sun will shine in on me
You, change your mind, you weren't the kind to live on me
I remember yesterday, turn my tears to laugher
Then you left and like a stray, I came running after

I remember you at night, palm trees softly swaying
I remember all the words you were softly saying

Glass house upon the hill so big and still, the shady lane
It's ours, my love, until the day we say auf wiedersehen

[Intro]
"Jimi's gonna do a thing that he, he wrote called 'Message of Love'"

[Verse 1]
Well, I travel at a speed
Of a reborn man
I got a lot of love to give
From the mirrors of my hand
I send a message of love
Don't you run away
Look at your heart
Come along with me today

[Verse 2]
Well I am what I am, thank God
Some people just don't understand what I'm about
Find yourself first
And then your tool
Find yourself first
Don't you be no fool

[Verse 3]
Here comes a woman
Wrapped up in chains
Messin' with that fool baby
Your life is pain
If you want to be free
Come on along with me
Don't mess with your man
He'll never understand
I said find yourself first
And then your talent
Work hard in your mind
So if you come alive
And then prove to the man
You're as strong as him
'Cause in the eyes of God
You're both chewin' it to him

[Outro]
Everybody come alive
Everybody love all night
Everybody love alive
Everybody hear my message
Make me a mask
That I can wear
'Till day is done
The wind in the trees
The falling leaves
The world's spinning

Make me a mask
So I can laugh
'Till nighttime comes
No more can I stay
How long must I play
This game of winning

If I had known this was only a dream
I would have awakened from this sleep

Make me a mask
So I can last
'Till the right time comes
A tear in my eye
To light I fly
And end is beginning

[Intro: Madonna]
If you wanna talk to me
That's exactly what you're gonna have to do
Talk
To me

[Verse 1: Madonna]
When we first met
You had a lot to give
I said, "If I was in your shoes, I could not lose"
But now, baby
I just don't know
I'm so confused
All this abuse is strange
'Cause you don't act like my friend and
I can't pretend
I don't want this to end

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
My daddy said
My momma said
My sisters' saying
My heart says

[Chorus: Madonna]
Lose your attitude, ring my bell
Say you're sorry, ring my bell
Got something for me, ring my bell
Then you can (Ring my bell)
Show some gratitude, ring my bell
Something nice to say, ring my bell
You will appreciate, ring my bell
Then you can (Ring my bell)

[Verse 2: Madonna, Pharrell Williams]
Y-y-y-you really have some nerve (Get it!)
Playing stupid games
Calling me names
And now
You wanna eat those words
Once you attack
You can't take it back
It's strange
I guess off your high horse you're fallin'
You're callin' and callin', I don't understand at all (Come on)

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna,  Pharrell Williams]
My daddy said (What?)
My momma said (Huh?)
My sister's saying (What they saying?)
My heart says

[Chorus: Madonna]
Lose your attitude, ring my bell
Say you're sorry, ring my bell
Got something for me, ring my bell
Then you can (Ring my bell)
Show some gratitude, ring my bell
Something nice to say, ring my bell
You will appreciate, ring my bell
Then you can (Ring my bell)

[Refrain: Madonna]
Ring my, ring my bell (You can't)
Ring my, ring my bell (You can't)
Ring my, ring my bell (My bell)
Ring my bell
Ring my, ring my bell (You can't)
Ring my, ring my bell (You can't)
Ring my, ring my bell (My bell)
Ring my bell

[Verse 3: Madonna, Pharrell Williams]
When you look in the mirror, don't know what you see?
Life's not the same
Until you're in pain
I know
It's just no good to hate
I don't want to say
It might be too late for you
I'm not answering your phone call
Babe, if you want more
You come to my front door (Come on)

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna,  Pharrell Williams]
My daddy said (What?)
My momma said (Hehe... Uh?)
My sister's saying (What they saying?)
My heart says

[Chorus: Madonna]
Lose your attitude, ring my bell
Say you're sorry, ring my bell
Got something for me, ring my bell
Then you can (Ring my bell)
Show some gratitude, ring my bell
Something nice to say, ring my bell
You will appreciate, ring my bell
Then you can (Ring my bell)

[Refrain: Madonna]
Ring my, ring my bell (You can't)
Ring my, ring my bell (You can't)
Ring my, ring my bell (My bell)
Ring my bell
Ring my, ring my bell (You can't)
Ring my, ring my bell (You can't)
Ring my, ring my bell (My bell)

[Outro]
Ring my bell
Ring my bell
Ring my bell
Ring my bell
Ring my bell
Ring my bell
Ring my bell
Ring my bell (Hey!)

Do you hear that whistle down the line, I figure that it's Engine #49
She's the only one that'll sound that way on the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe
See the old smoke rising round the bend
I reckon that she knows she's gonna meet a friend

Folks around these parts set the time of day
From on the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe
Here she comes, whoo oo oo oo, hey Jim, you better get the rig

Whoo oo oo oo, she's got a list of passengers that's pretty big
And they'll all want a lift to Brown's Hotel
'Cause lots of them been traveling for quite a spell
All the way from Philadelphia on the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe

All aboard, all aboard, oo oo oo
Let her rip, let her rip, Mr. Engineer
Gotta go, gotta go far away from here
While the man at the fire shovels in the coals
Stick your head out the cab and watch the drivers roll

See the towns and the roads go a whizzing by
Fare thee well Laramie and Rocky Mountain High
Yes sirree, here we are, going all the way, mustn't quit 'til we hit California
See the old smoke rising round the bend
I reckon that she knows she's gonna meet a friend
Folks around these parts set the time of day
From on the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe

[Chorus]
Don't get lost in heaven
They got locks on the gate
Don't go over the edge
You'll make a big mistake

[Verse 1]
I got off a plane to the countryside
I drove to the mountain and a hole in the ground
There was crack on the corner and someone dead
And fire coming out of a monkey's head

[Chorus]
Don't get lost in heaven
They got locks on the gate
Don't go over the edge
You'll make a big mistake
Don't get lost in heaven
They got locks on the gate
Don't go over the edge
You'll make a big mistake

[Verse 2]
Put me on a cab to the corner clown
I just took a line but I never was 'round
There was more of it there, when I come back home
But you had left me 'cause you don't know my soul
You're a ho, girl
Yeah, 'cause you're a hobo
You can't get home, girl
You can't get home

[Chorus]
Don't get lost in heaven
They got locks on the gate (Oh yeah)
Don't go over the edge
You'll make a big mistake
Don't get lost in heaven
They got locks on the gate
Don't go over the edge
You'll make a big mistake

[Verse 1]

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Lana drew a picture in school today
One that made her mother cry
A picture of a woman with a drink in her hand
Standing by a child with no eyes

Watching her reaction based upon revenge
Babies blown to kingdom come
Damn the logic, cartoon characters
Look better when they're on the run

Danny dropped the dime on his girlfriend
He said he didn't wanna go to jail alone
The seed lives in the same mind
With the thought that says we all should be stoned

The people lookin' for angels in the sky
Whenever they're broken-hearted
Love is grown, seeds are sown
A fire don't burn unless it's started

[Refrain]
La la la la la la, tra-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la

[Chorus]
Did you ever feel that life was like lookin' for a penny
In a large room with no light?
A sophisticated mass-produced cacophony
Of no-win situations that aren't right?

[Refrain]
Sha-la la la la la, sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2]
Every time you wake up there's a little motherfucker
Talkin' big stuff in your face
(Are you happy?)
You only get the kind of people that open their mouth
Just to swap feet
Welcome to the rat race
Oh, oh, oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh

[Chorus]
Did you ever feel that life was like lookin' for a penny
In a large room with no light?
A sophisticated mass-produced cacophony
Of no-win situations that aren't right?

[Chorus]
Oh, if you could just pass your history class
Maybe life would be alright
Until then you'll be lookin' for a penny
In a large room with no light
Yeah

[Refrain]
Sha-la la la la la, sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la

[Outro]
No light
No light
No light
No light
No light
No light
And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
Jilly loves you more than you will know
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Oh bless you please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
Hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey; hey, hey, hey)

We'd like to know a little bit about you for our file
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
Look around you all you see are sympathetic eyes
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home

The PTA, Mrs. Robinson
Won't OK the way you do your thing
Ding, ding, ding

And you'll get yours, Mrs. Robinson
Foolin' with that young stuff like you do
Boo, hoo, hoo, woo, woo, woo
So how's your bird, Mrs. Robinson
"Dandy", Mrs. Robinson you'd say
Hey, hey, hey

Well have you heard, Mrs. Robinson
Mine is fine as wine, and I should know
Ho, ho, ho
If everybody had ocean across the U.S.A
Then everybody'd be surfin' like Californ-i-a
You'd seem 'em wearing their baggy, Huarachi sandals too
A bushy bushy blonde hairdo, surfin' U.S.A
	
You'd catch 'em surfin' at Del Mar, Ventura County line
Santa Cruz and Trestle, Australia's Narrabeen
All over Manhattan, Lunada Bay P.V
Everybody's gone surfin', surfin' U.S.A

We'll all be planning that route, we're gonna take real soon
We're sanding down our surfboards, we can't wait for June
We'll all be gone for the summer, we're on surfari to stay
Tell the teacher we're surfin', surfin' U.S.A

Haggerties and Swamies, Pacific Palisades
San Onofre and Sunset, San Anoquies and Summer Bay
All over La Jolla, at Wa'imea Bay
Everybody's gone surfin', surfin' U.S.A

Everybody's gone surfin', surfin' U.S.A
Everybody's gone surfin', surfin' U.S.A

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
You've got a smile so bright
You know you could have been a candle
I'm holding you so tight
You know you could have been a handle
The way you swept me off my feet
You know you could have been a broom
The way you smell so sweet
You know you could have been some perfume

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
Well, you could have been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell, the way you do the things you do
The way you do the things you do, the way you do the things you do

[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
As pretty as you are (Hoo-hoo)
You know you could have been a flower
If good looks was a minute (Hoo-hoo)
You know that you could be an hour
The way you stole my heart (Hoo-hoo)
You know you could have been a cool crook
And baby you're so smart (Hoo-hoo)
You know you could have been a schoolbook

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
Well, you could have been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell, the way you do the things you do
The way you do the things you do, the way you do the things you do

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
You made my heart so rich (Hoo-hoo)
You know you could have been some money
And baby, you're so sweet (Hoo-hoo)
You know you could have been some honey

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
Well, you could have been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell, the way you do the things you do
The way you do the things you do, the way you do the things you do

[Outro: Eddie Kendricks & The Temptations]
You really swept me off my feet (The way you do the things you do)
You made my life complete (The way you do the things you do)
You made my life so bright (The way you do the things you do)
You make me feel alright (The way you do the things you do)
You make me feel alright (The way you do the things you do)
You make me feel alright (The way you do the things you do)

[Verse 2: Daz Dillinger]
When I was a little baby boy
My mama gave me a brand new toy
Two turn tables with the mix and I learned to rhyme like a dolomite
Time went by in a fly creation
I knew someday I would rock the nation
So I made up my mind just what to do
Put on some gray and blue and made my own crew

And since you dig, your shit on hit and this is how we rock
I chitty bang my city man and this is for the block
Equipped to hit, I get you whipped and spit that shit you like
Im on like superfly tonight
Cus I dont have no kryptonite

[Bridge]

[Hook](x2)
Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamer's only dream
Heaven's angel, devil's daughter

Say, my mind, should I go with her on silent nights
She'll drive me crazy in the end
And I should leave this paradise
But I can't leave her
While I need her more than she needs you
That's what I'm living for

Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamer's only dream
Heaven's angel, devil's daughter

Say, my thought, should I find out she don't care at all
She'll leave me crying in the end
Wandering through the afterglow
But I can't leave her
While I need her more than she needs you
That's what I'm praying for
Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamer's only dream
Heaven's angel, devil's daughter

Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamer's only dream
Heaven's angel, devil's daughter

La, la, la
La, la, la, la, la...
Here I am, on the lam ready to go
Brighter days have hurried me along, nobody's wrong
Love stays the same a heart's not to blame nothing is over
Now it don't worry me at all there's just got to be
Some kind of overflow nobody falls
People, we cry, when wells go dry it threatens tomorrow
Try and find some ways to ease the fright, burn into the night
But maybe a little rain would soothe the pain and drown our sorrows
And looking straight at all that lives again
Until we get our fill of overflows, nobody knows
In search of love, the seasons above have taken to wander
Unlike the ones we used to know, where did they go?
Well, here I am, on the lam, low overflow
Brighter days have hurried me along
To see the rain come shinning through, nobody's blue
Oh seagull, tis an hour of plight
Energy from your wing helps bring the rain
Call on your brotherhood of flight and let it rain all nights
Oh sky lookin clear and bright, Moon, with your own true light
Turn the tides and rain all night, Turn the tides and rain all night
All the love of my mother, I offer to you
And I'll try so very hard , to get you through
If lay down my life, for my King and country men
Would it change you for the better
It better be all right
To be always like children
Afraid of the night

If I gave up the cause , what would you give me
To make up for all the things that I would lose
If I lay down my life , for my King and country men
Would it change you for the better
It better be all right
To be always like children
Afraid of the night

Well you better get busy , get it over and done
I was here when you arrived , I'll be here when you're gone
If I give up my life for my King and country men
Would it change you for the better
It better be all right
To be never like people
Afraid of the night
Time it goes on waits for nobody special
In the prime of my life I'll remember you
Living and breathing and some misbelieving
But I can't hold you woman, no piece of you
You were the magic , my only believer
My life on the line for you
All that I give to you
Time is time
Don't give me no time to waste away
Love is love
Keep me alive to my dying day
Now is now
We capture the world
And love will make it all right, all right

Time it goes on waits for nothing on over
But I still see your sun that you shine on me
Giving and taking and always mistaking
But I'll follow you woman , eternally
You were the magic , my only believer
My life on the line for you
All that I give to you
Time is time
Don't give me no time to waste away
Love is love
Keep me alive to my dying day
Now is now
We capture the world
And love will make it all right , all right
Setting my sights in one only direction
Searching for romance and showing affection
I guess I better know one, standing in the cold dark
Waiting for your love

Time is time
Don't give me no wrong in making love
Love is love, turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now, we master the world
And time will make it all right, all right

Time is time
Don't give me no wrong in making love
Love is love, turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now, we master the world
And time will make it all right, all right

Time is time
Don't give me no wrong in making love
Love is love, turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now, we master the world
And time will make it all right, all right

Time is time
Don't give me no wrong in making love
Love is love, turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now, we master the world
And time will make it all right, all right
I got a bad case of love
I got a bad case of love
I got a bad case of love
I got a bad case of love
I got a bad case of love
People, my heart is filled with misery

I live in loneliness, never get no rest
Went to see a love doctor to get out of this mess
Took a look at me before he cast his spell
Shook his head, then began to yell

You got a bad case of love
You got a bad case of love
You got a bad case of love
Boy, your heart is filled with misery

I said, "Doctor, doctor, please do something for me
I feel like a man going through the third degree
Can't sleep at night, can't eat a bite
Since she been gone nothing ever goes right"
He said, "Son, I know just how you feel
You love your baby and you always will
But your wind is short, your pulse is weak
It won't be long before you're six feet deep"

You got a bad case of love
You got a bad case of love
You got a bad case of love
Boy, your heart is filled with misery
"Happy new year first of all. I hope we'll have million or two million more of them... if we can get over this summer, he he he. Right I'd like to dedicate this one to the draggin' scene that's goin' on all the soldiers that are fightin' in Chicago, Milwaukee and New York... Oh yeas, and all the soldiers fightin' in Vietnam. Like to do a thing called 'Machine Gun'"

Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart

Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart

Evil man make me kill ya
Evil man make you kill me
Evil man make me kill you
Even though we're only families apart

Well I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer
(You know what I mean)
Hey and your bullets keep knocking me down

Hey I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer now
Yeah but you still blast me down to the ground

The same way you shoot me down baby
You'll be going just the same
Three times the pain
And your own self to blame
Hey machine gun
Oooooooooo

I ain't afraid of your mess no more, babe
I ain't afraid no more
After a while your your cheap talk don't even cause me pain
So let your bullets fly like rain
'Cause I know all the time you're wrong baby
And you'll be goin' just the same
Yeah machine gun
Tearing my family apart
Yeah yeah alright
Tearing my family apart

Don't you shoot him down
He's about to leave here
Don't you shoot him down
He's got to stay here
He ain't going nowhere
He's been shot down to the ground
Oh where he can't survive no no

Yeah that's what we don't wanna hear any more, alright
No bullets
At least here, huh huh
No guns, no bombs
Huh huh
No nothin', just let's all live and live
You know instead of killin'

I dream of you (I dream of you)
And me on a rendezvous
Somewhere (Somewhere) far away on a trip for two
We'll take a ride (Take a ride)
A convertible on a straight highway
Girl, now's the time to lay you down and make you mine

[Chorus]
Candy Star, Silver Moon, Cherry Rain, Summer June
Chocolate me, Caramel you
My lucky charm is what you are
Caramel, candy cane, sweeter than sugar cane
Love it when you call my name
Lucky charm is what you are

[Verse 2]
I'll pour some drinks (Pour some drinks)
Then we'll play some CD's
I'll take your hand, yeah (Take your hand)
And pull you up close to me
Now tell me, can you hear the voice of love calling you and me?
Girl, now's the time to lay you down and make you mine

[Chorus]
Candy Star, Silver Moon, Cherry Rain, Summer June
Chocolate me, Caramel you
My lucky charm is what you are

I'll run your bath (Run your bath)
Girl, you just make yourself at home
Don't have a care (Have a care)
In the world cause we're all alone
Just slip off that robe (Take it off, girl)
And follow the love making sign
Girl, now's the time to lay you down and make you mine

[Chorus]
Candy Star, Silver Moon, Cherry Rain, Summer June
Chocolate me, Caramel you

Caramel, candy cane, sweeter than sugar cane
Love it when you call my name

Cherries and lemon limes do it to me all the time
Sweet to the last drop
Girl, you're magically delicious
You are my...

[Chorus]
Candy Star, Silver Moon, Cherry Rain, Summer June
Chocolate me, Caramel you
My lucky charm is what you are

Lucky charm (Girl, you taste just like candy)
Candy Star, Silver Moon, Cherry Rain, Summer June
Chocolate me, Caramel you
My lucky charm is what you are
Caramel, candy cane, sweeter than sugar cane
Love it when you call my name
Lucky charm is what you are

[Verse 1]
There is no sense in being interested
In a child, a group, or in a society
There is no sense
If one does not see
In them before anything else
The life, its capacity
To be founded upon itself

[Verse 2]
There is no sense in being interested in
An ill person or unwell society
If one cannot believe their readiness
(Auto production, auto organisation
Auto production, auto organisation)
And the capacity
For proper recovery
(Auto production, auto organisation
Auto production, auto organisation)

[Outro]
An ill person or unwell society
If one cannot believe their readiness
And the capacity
For proper recovery
You take one part Buddha
And two parts cat
Run them through your computer
And that's where he's at
Some say he's ruthless
And some say he's a saint
They tell you he's innocent
I tell you he ain't

I hear him think
I follow his flight
I'd know that footstep
In the darkest of nights

I follow that man

He's a creature of stealth
Don't run with the mob
Won't stop at nothing
Till he finishes the job
I hear him out there laughing
When he knows I'm closing in
I feel the desperation
Of the fool within
He's like your shadow
You can stop it dead
But when you go to take him
He's a step ahead

I follow that man

(I follow from a distance
As he appears
Between the darkness and the light
Meeted curtains part
He takes a drink
He takes a smoke
Takes a paper
He takes me along for the ride
I snatch his bag
We go deeper
Into the quarter
Through a rain slaked dampness into an alley
The smell of garbage and perfume
Brick by brick
His woman meets me
But it doesn't matter
Anyway, whose chasing who
I'm just holding the bag)
I hear him out there laughing
When he knows I'm closing in
I feel the desperation
I hear him think
I follow his flight
I'd know that footstep
In the darkest of nights

I follow that man
I follow that man

I watch him smoke
I watch him drink
I follow that man
I follow that man
Here, I am
And beyond the reach of my hands
She's sound asleep
And she's sweet another know why
These dreams could've seen her
And I watched her slipping away
And I know I'll be hunting high and low
High...
There's no end to the lengths
I'll go too high and low
High...
There's no end to the lengths
I'll go too find her again
Upon this my dreams I depend
And, through the dark
I can hear the pounding of her heart
Next to mine
She's the sweetest love I could find
So I know I'll be hunting high and low
High...
There's no end to the lengths
I'll go too high and low
High...
Do you know how it feels to love you?
Do you know how it feels to love you?
High and Low

[Verse 1]
Have you ever seen a rainbow
Or a garden blooming bright
Heard the shuffle of a thousand feet
Drums from morning 'til night?

[Chorus]
Come we go down, come we go down
Come we go down to Kingston Market
Come we go down, come we go down
Down to Kingston Market

[Verse 2]
Get your tamarind and sour sop
Mangoes and casaba
Bread fruit, okra, pigeon peas
Curry goat and guava

[Chorus]
Oh, come we go down, come we go down
Come we go down to Kingston Market
Come we go down, come we go down
Down to Kingston market

[Bridge]
Do you know a brown skin maiden
With sunshine in her eyes?
Heard the swallow and the hummingbird
Sing happy as she goes by?
Have you seen the ghost of Morgan
Or heard a tale you hadn't ought to?
Have you welcomed the coming dawn
With a rum and coconut water?

[Chorus]
Come we go down, come we go down
Come we go down to Kingston Market
Come we go down, come we go down
Down to Kingston market
Come we go down, come we go down
Come we go down to Kingston Market
Come we go down, come we go down
Down to Kingston Market

[Outro]
Come we go down, come we go down
Come we go down to Kingston Market
Come we go down, come we go down
Down to Kingston Market

[Intro: Pitbull]
If you came to get...
If you came to get...
If you came to get...

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
If you came to get crazy
Then you came to the right place
DJ drop drop the bass
Shut down the place
Show these jokers, who got the ace?
These girls got sexy written on their face
I'm in the zone ah
About to conquer everything like Rome
I'm feeling golden
Can't stop 'em, can't control 'em
Only hope to contain unless if you know 'em

Get get get loose, get get get wild

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
So give me that high

'Cause I was high
When you made me fly, made me fly
So give me that high
Like you did last night, did last night
'Cause I was high
When you made me fly, made me fly

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I'm a biggidy mic checker, on biggidy big records
A biggidy big playboy with women for breakfast
You're mistaking if you're thinking it's just a song
This my life from dusk til dawn
I'm not the best, I'm just better
Yeah, they smart, me? I'm clever
At 45 thousand feet
You think I care about the weather?
Okay, maybe a little
Turbulence is like fame
It's hard to get used to, especially with YouTube
Hah!
I know this different, ain't princess
And I ain't talkin about Lorenas in tutus
Hah!
Real life James Bond
Killin `em in suits then choppin up the deuces
Hah!
Now let's take over the world
And let's do it your way girl

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
So give me that high
Like you did last night, did last night
'Cause I was high
When you made me fly, made me fly
So give me that high
Like you did last night, did last night
'Cause I was high
When you made me fly, made me fly

We come on the sloop John B
My grandfather and me
Around Nassau town we did roam
Drinking all night
Got into a fight
Well, I feel so broke up
I want to go home
So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home, yeah, yeah
Well, I feel so broke up
I wanna go home
The first mate he got drunk
And broke in the captain's trunk
The constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone
Why don't you leave me alone? Yeah, yeah
Well, I feel so broke up
I wanna go home
So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home
Let me go home
Why don't you let me go home?
(Hoist up the John B's sail)
Hoist up the John B
Well, I feel so broke up
I wanna go home
Let me go home
The poor cook he caught the fits
And threw away all my grits
And then he took and he ate up all of my corn
Let me go home
Why don't they let me go home?
This is the worst trip
I've ever been on
So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home
Let me go home
Why don't you let me go home?

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
It could be another misunderstanding
You should stop trippin' and find out what is happenin'
Before you start pointing fingers do something for me
Realize there's two sides to every story
It's just another misunderstanding (No, no, no)
You should stop trippin' and find out what is happenin' (No, no)
Before you start pointing fingers do something for me (Yeah)
Realize there's two sides to every story

[Verse 1: Shawn Stockman]
The club is closing down
Been invited to a party at my homie's house
Got my crew and rolled out
Called my girl on my celly before I hopped in my V
No answer, oh well, baby, must be sleepin'
Said she had a long day and didn't feel like clubbin'
Can't wait 'till I get home so she can give me some lovin'
So we bounced, headed out, rolled up to my homie's spot
Thought I saw somebody familiar up in the parking lot
Walked up to the door, gave pounds and hugs
Right back homies showin' me love
Distracted for a moment 'til I went inside
And now I'm looking right in her eyes, oh oh

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Shawn Stockman]
It could be another misunderstanding
You should stop trippin' and find out what is happenin'
Before you start pointing fingers do something for me
Realize there's two sides to every story
(Two sides, two sides, yeah)
It's just another misunderstanding (Misunderstanding)
You should stop trippin' and find out what is happenin' (Oh, oh)
Before you start pointing fingers do something for me
Realize there's two sides to every story

[Verse 2: Wanya Morris]
I was at the crib when I heard my cell phone
Knew it was my girl 'cause I recognized the ringtone
Said she's still at work and she'd be late coming home
But I was too preoccupied 'cause the game was on
Hung up the phone and it rang again
It was my boy Hakeem who valets at Crustaceans
Sent an email with a picture attached
With my girl and some dude that read
"This is where your girl be at," oh

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
It could be another misunderstanding (It could be another, oh)
You should stop trippin' and find out what is happenin'
(You should stop trippin')
Before you start pointing fingers do something for me
Realize there's two sides to every story
(Realize it's two sides)
It's just another misunderstanding (No, no, no)
You should stop trippin' and find out what is happenin'
(Find out what is happenin')
Before you start pointing fingers do something for me
(Oh, do something for me)
Realize there's two sides to every story
(There's two sides, ooh)

[Bridge: Nathan Morris, Boyz II Men]
I can understand how you feel
But don't overreact until you know the deal
Step back and peep the situation
Don't be hasty, baby, for lack of being patient
The truth will come out in time
If you move too fast forward then you can't rewind
(Can't rewind)
So pimipin', be easy, stop catchin' feelings
Two sides to every story, find out what the real is

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
It could be another misunderstanding
You should stop trippin' and find out what is happenin'
Before you start pointing fingers do something for me
(Do something for me)
Realize there's two sides to every story (Ooh)
It's just another misunderstanding (Misunderstanding)
You should stop trippin' and find out what is happenin'
(Find out what is happenin')
Before you start pointing fingers do something for me
(Do something for me)
Realize there's two sides to every story
(Two sides to every story-ory-ory-or-or-or-ory)

[Verse]
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

[Bridge]
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

[Outro]
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

[Verse 1]
Relax
I've come away with a panic attack
The spinning lights make it hard to react
Catch your breath, take your furniture back

[Chorus]
It's for the taking
All these girls are waiting
Love's not God forsaking
And that's worth celebrating

[Interlude]
Relax
Relax

[Verse 2]
Relax
I've come away with a panic attack
The spinning lights make it hard to react
Catch your breath, take your furniture back
Relax
I've got the coat and the jackets to match
We can replace everything that you lack
Take a book and a nicotine patch

[Pre-Chorus]
It's for the taking
All these girls are waiting
Love's not God forsaking
And that's worth celebrating
It's for the taking
All these girls are waiting
Love's not God forsaking
And that's worth celebrating

[Interlude]
Relax
Relax
Relax

[Chorus]
It's for the taking
All these girls are waiting
Love's not God forsaking
And that's worth celebrating
It's for the taking
All these girls are waiting
Love's not God forsaking
And that's worth celebrating

[Outro]
Relax
I've got a good mind to give up living, and go shopping
Instead
I say, I've got a good mind to give up living, and go
Shopping instead
To pick up me a tombstone, and be pronounced dead

When I read your letter this morning, that was in your
Place in bed
I read your letter this morning, that was in your place
In bed
And that's when I decided, that I would be better off
Dead

It read, there is no use you looking, or ever hoping to
Get me back
Oh, there's no use you looking, or ever hoping to get me
Back
Yes, because it's all over now, and baby you can bet on
That
Baby, you've got me going out of my mind
The thought of you has got me high, I'm so excited
I've always said I'd, I'd never fall in love
But I think I've had a change of mind

'cause you've got me (in love)
I'm so exposed (truth is)
And heaven knows (that's why)
That if I could, I'll make the loving, girl

(if you) girl, just believe
(that I'm all) I'm all you need
Without you, no, you can't deny
Without your love, I can't survive

Your love, oh girl, I can't explain
It cools me like the morning rain
(girl you know your loving feels good)
I'm sure my heart won't be the same because I'm in love
I'll tell the world, that I'm in love again
Even if I'm here
For a million years
I'll never find true love, at least that's what I told
They say, it disappears, baby, after a while
I disagree because you make me smile
Girl, they just can't see your type of love is gold

(you know) girl, can't you see
(truth is) down on my knees
(that's why) and if I could, I'll make the loving, girl

(if you) girl, can't you see
(that I'm all) I'm all you need
Don't you know, I can't deny
Without your love, I can't survive

Your love, oh girl, I can't explain
(girl, you know your loving feels good)
'cause you're deeper than the arex band
I'm sure (I'm positive) because I'm in love
I'll tell the world, that I'm in love again

Cauz your love, oh girl, I can't pretend
(girl, you know I can't pretend)
I'm feeling for your tender kiss
I'm sure I've never felt a love like this
Until I tell the world, that we're in love again
Oh oh baby, come on, come on

Your love, oh girl, I can't explain
It cools me like the morning rain
I'm sure my heart won't be the same because I'm in love
I'll tell the world, that I'm in love again

Cauz your love, oh girl, I can't explain
'cause you're deeper than the arex band
I'm sure (I'm positive) because I'm in love
I'll tell the world, that I'm in love again

Cauz your love, oh girl, I can't pretend
I'm feeling for your tender kiss
I'm sure I'll never find a love like this
We can tell the whole world, that we're in love again

Your love, oh girl, I can't explain
It cools me like the morning rain
I'm sure my heart won't be the same because I'm in love
I'll tell the world, that I'm in love again

Cauz your love, oh girl, I can't explain
'cause you're deeper than the arex band
I'm sure my heart won't be the same because I'm in love
I'll tell the world, that I'm in love again
Can't U feel the pumpin', baby?
Boom boom, pumpin', baby

CHORUS:

[Intro:]
Alright, y’all
Get up out of them chairs
If you’re driving, don’t get up out your seat though
‘Cause it’s time to dance! Hey, hey!
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Now lift your hands up
Come on, get up
Take a listen…

[Verse 1:]
I want to start things out by giving testimony
Cause one of my friends got ill seriously
Now the doctor told him ain't no way you gone' live
But he prayed his prayer in faith
And a miracle appeared

[Chorus:]
It’s already alright (oh yes it is, oh yes it is)
It’s already alright
And all you got to do is
Just bow your head down
Just bow and pray
And then give it all up
And know everything's gonna be okay
Just throw your hands up
And then wave them left to right
And now do your dance child
Cause it’s alright already

[Verse 2:]
Always surrounded by negativity
This might be where I live
But it ain't gonna change me
Gotta work on my mind
And keep my actions pure
And when I stumble, I know who has the cure
So any time your feeling down
Just lift your voice in praise
It'll pick you right up
And you can come to Him don't be afraid
Anytime , day or night He can give you what you need
And if you pray your prayer in faith
And in your heart believe that

[Chorus:]
It’s already alright (oh yes it is, oh yes it is)
It’s already alright
And all you got to do is
Just bow your head down
Just bow and pray
And then give it all up
And know everything's gonna be okay
Just throw your hands up
And then wave them left to right
And now do your dance child
Cause it’s alright already

[Bridge:]
When life's problems get you down
Can't find no peace nowhere around
Trust in the spirit you can't see
Its bout to bring you your relief
Go ahead and cry now, Its alright
Cause now you're cryin’ tears of joy
This life ain't hurting you no more
Cause you know its already alright

[Chorus:]
It’s already alright (oh yes it is, oh yes it is)
It’s already alright
And all you got to do is
Just bow your head down
Just bow and pray
And then give it all up
And know everything's gonna be okay
Just throw your hands up
And then wave them left to right
And now do your dance child
Cause it’s alright already

[Chorus]
It's gonna be a long, long winter for me
(For me)
A long, long winter you'll see
(You'll see)

[Verse 1]
That girl is gone from me
Left my heart in misery
And it's a long, long winter for me
(You'll see)

[Bridge]
Now that she's gone, gone, gone
Days and nights are dreary and blue
Now that she's gone, gone, gone
The lonely memories linger here too

[Chorus]
Said that girl is gone from me
Left my heart in misery
And it's a long, long winter for me
(For me)

[Bridge]
Now that she's gone, gone, gone
Days and nights are dreary and blue
Now that she's gone, gone, gone
Lonely memories linger here too

[Chorus]
Said that girl is gone from me
Left my heart in misery
And it's a long, long winter for me
(You'll see)
It's gonna be cold, cold and dreary everyday
(Oh yea)

[Verse 2]
But I hope lord, said I hope lord
She won't no want it that way oh, no, no, no, no
Lord, I hope that I am right
'Cause I can't stand these lonely nights
With this longer, longer, longer
Longer, longer, longer, longer winter for me
(You'll see)

[Outro]
Oh she's gone days and nights dreary and blue
Now that she's gone, gone, gone
Lonely memories linger here too said that girl
The pimp's going round extinguishing the flame
Digging the tranches in which to bury hearts
The dim and cold climate of awareness
Where the reptiles thrive and people are made to walk the streets

This heat, the purpose, in my heart, generates, infinite, energy there's nothing to worry, share the immensity

He went round switching the people's hearts off, promising to deal with reality
We bought it, because everything seemed more bearable than immensity
I got a whole lot of lovin'
Baby just waiting for you
I got a whole lot of lovin'
Baby just waiting for you
And the way I could love you woman
Honey I know you could love me too

Oh you're so good lookin' baby
And you build up from the ground
Well you're so good lookin' baby

And you build up from the ground
Every time I see you baby
My love starts tumbling down

Yeah, you're just my type baby
Just my height and size
Said you're just my type baby
You're just my height and size
And the reason I love you
Because you've got those little dreamy eyes
Well you know I was always the first to arrive at the party
Oh, and the last to leave the scene of the crime
Well it started with a couple of beers
And it went I don't know how many years
Like a run away train heading for the
End of the line

Well I finally got around to admit that I might have a problem
But I thought it was just too damn big of a mountain to climb
Well I got down on my knees and said "Hey
I just can't go on living this way
Guess I have to learn to live my life
One day at a time."

Oh yeah, one day at a time
Oh yeah, one day at a time

Oh yeah, one day at a time
Oh yeah, one day at a time

Well I finally got around to admit that I was the problem
When I use to put the blame on everybody's shoulders but mine
All the friends I use to run with are gone
But I hadn't planned on living this long
Have to learn to live my life
One day at a time
It was something I was too blind to see
I got help from something greater then me
And I have to learn to live my life
One day at a time
Run run run away so lost lost never comin'
Home rollin' rollin' down a track
No no I'm never comin' back
Love pumpin' in my veins
Our love I hope it's not too late
That's the road that's the load that's the role
I've been down I've been down I've been down

(What part of forever)
(Don't you understand)

I could stay stay stay, if that's what you want want want
I'd give it to you you you
If I had a heart heart heart
And we could go go go
And never look back on now
I'd give it to you you you
If I had a heart heart heart

Run run run away so lost lost never comin'
Home rollin' rollin' down a track
No no I'm never comin' back
Love pumpin' pumpin' in my veins
Our love I hope it's not too late
That's the road that's the load that's the role
I've been down I've been down I've been down down
(What part of forever)
(Don't you understand)

I could stay stay stay, if that's what you want want want
I'd give it to you you you
If I had a heart heart heart
And we could go go go
And never look back on now
I'd give it to you you you
If I had a heart heart heart

Imagine eternity, it doesn't seem that hard
They say nothing lasts forever
We'll have to prove them wrong

I could stay stay stay, if that's what you want want want
I'd give it to you you you
If I had a heart heart heart
And we could go go go
And never look back on now
I'd give it to you you you
If I had a heart heart heart
Everyday we wake outside the sea
Forgetting all of our allergies
To the world
Space was a lie
But the sun still shines
Down on me
But you don't have to tell me
That the waves will crash
Easily
Everyday we wake outside the sea
Forgetting all of our allergies
And we don't have to sit around for weed
This world
Space was a lie
And the sun still shines
Down on me
But you don't have to tell me
That the waves will crash
Easily

[Verse 1: John Legend]
From the very first time back when I met you at school
I looked in your eyes, saw something special in you
We inspire that we will be American dream
Escape this reality, come start a new one with me

[Pre-Chorus: John Legend]
We could be neighborhood royalty
Or much more than that you'll see, we're makin' history
We'll go to the mass, fly to heaven and back
The highest heights imagine, yes, as we can do all of that, baby

[Chorus: John Legend]
La la la la la la la la la la la
We could be King & Queen someday
La la la la la la la la la la la
We'll never throw our dreams away

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
We'll make this picture complete, start a new family
A boy that looks just like you, a girl that looks just like me
And each day that they grow, we'll teach them all that we know
Help me show them the way
We'll show them we're not afraid to be free

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
The only thing that should be
The fliest fantasies, the highest they can dream
Grab hold to my hand, say that you'll be my man
Someday you'll be my king and baby I'm your queen to be

[Chorus: John Legend & Mary J. Blige]
La la la la la la la la la la la
We could be King & Queen someday, someday
La la la la la la la la la la la
We'll never throw our dreams away

[Bridge: John Legend + Mary J. Blige]
Cities may crumble, the world is in trouble
But we'll be in love and we'll rise above it
Each of our people, pray for a leader
I know we will be someday, someday, oh
Someday, someday, someday, oh, someday

[Chorus: John Legend & Mary J. Blige]
La la la la la la la la la la la
We'll never throw our dreams away
La la la la la la la la la la la
We could be King & Queen someday
La la la la la la la la la la la
We could be King & Queen someday, someday
La la la la la la la la la la la
We'll never throw our dreams away

[Intro]
Ohh, ohh, ohh-ohh
Ahh, ohh-ohh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
I think this is my last chance
My last chance
My last chance
My last chance with you

[Verse]
Hey, baby
May I have this dance?
I've been waiting all night
For the song to be right
Now they've turned down the lights
Hey, darling
May I have this dance?
Oh, baby
And there's how you feel
My love is real
For you, oh, baby
May I have-
Hey, baby
Dance with me
And maybe you'll see
What I feel is really real
For you
Hey, baby
May I have this dance?
This is my last chance
To get close to you
If you only knew
What I've been going through
Oh, baby
I'm just a shy guy
I'm so nervous
Girl, but I got to try
Girl, please, take my hand
Dance with me, baby
Please dance real close to me
Oh, baby, yeah

[Outro]
Can I go with you, baby?
Oh, oh

[Chorus: till fade]
Now she could dance that slow Uvalde shuffle to some cowboy hustle

Into thinkin' that he's got her this time

Hill country honky-tonkin' Rita Ballou
Every beer joint in town has played the fool for you
Backslidin' barrel ridin' Rita Ballou
Ain't a cowboy in Texas would not ride a bull for you

She's a rawhide rope and velvet mixture walkin' talkin' Texas texture
High timin' barroom fixture kind of a girl
She's the queen of cowboys look at ol' Willard grinnin' now, boys
You'd a-thought there's less fools in this world

Hill country honky-tonkin' Rita Ballou
Every beer joint in town has played the fool for you
Backslidin' barrel ridin' Rita Ballou
Ain't a cowboy in Texas would not ride a bull for you

Good luck, Willard, and here's to ya
Here's to Rita and I hope she'll do ya
Right all night
Lord, I wish I was the fool in your shoes
Hill country honky-tonkin' Rita Ballou
Every beer joint in town has played the fool for you
Backslidin' barrel ridin' Rita Ballou
Ain't a cowboy in Texas would not ride a bull for you
Talkin loud and you sayin nothin
Talkin loud and you sayin nothin
Talkin loud and you sayin nothin

[Hook]
Lot of yall talkin but yall really don’t do it
Really don’t do it, really don’t do it
Lot of yall speakin but yall really don’t do it
Really don’t do it, really don’t do it
A lot of yall leakin, man yall really don’t do it
Really don’t do it, really don’t do it
You like to talk about it but you really don’t do it
Really don’t do it, let me show you how I do it

I do it, I do it, I do it
I do it, I did it, I do it
Talkin loud and you sayin nothing

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I bought a Cadillac when I was 17 years old
With a fake ID up in my bill fold
Up out of high school shit about a year ago
If I don’t get rich fuck bitch then it’s a miracle
Ready for this, ready for this
A whole life nigga, prepared for this
I’m lookin through the mirrors of my eyelids
I never live in silence, I’m flyin like a pilot
If the sea got though
He got flow, he like a tic-tac-hoe
So all you bitches and you niggas say you knew that hoe
Money bitches and weed is who I do this for

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Jibba jabba, shit stack, don’t matter
Nigga put yo muthafuckin gat up
Now knuckle up, we go fist to fist
Soon as you drop yo hip you gonna kiss the whip
Buy it real quick, not no affiliate
You see years ago I stopped doin silly shit
So I can climb the ladder of success at my best
Smoking everywhere I go and everyday I’m in the press
Flyin in on the jet, hit the tarmac
In a whip that you can best bet
I’m from the east side but the west is where I rest at
And if my hair wasn’t locked up I’d go and get a wet set

Talkin loud and you sayin nothing
Talkin loud and you sayin nothing
Talkin loud and you sayin nothing
Talkin loud and you sayin nothing

We about it, we about it
We about it, we about it
We about it, we about it
Don’t talk that shit
We about it, we about it
We about it, we about it
We about it, we about it
Don’t talk that shit

Cus you’ll get fucked up quick
Get fucked up quick, get fucked up quick
Get fucked up quick
Don’t talk that shit
Cus you’ll get fucked up quick

[Hook]

[Intro: German Woman]
Guten tag, Ich liebe diesen Tag
Ich can't find on this sing
Oh mein Gott, ich glaube Conan, sign con me
Ich swear to God, dizzy unbusted

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
You know my story
I did a lot of balling
Been around the world
A lot of girls calling
A lot of panties falling
Out the air and on the stage
If my life was a book
You wouldn't miss a page
But none of that really matters
When I cut my eyes and roll
Seen her pass by
I damn near dropped my folds
I'm like Snoopy breathe
Kush had me gone
I couldn't think straight
Pimpin' was all alone
Shoulda seen her walking
Like a model do
If this was Twitter
I would follow you
Open your world to new things
Let Doggy take your hand
I'm seeing wedding rings
Call Diddy lets make a band
She got me hot
I don't want to leave
I seen the world's best
But she's something to see
And now I'm on a plane
Feeling so ashamed
I couldn't catch her name
I call her Miss Everything

[Hook]
Tell me have you seen her (Seen her)
Five something, pretty face, and them big brown eyes
Small little waist
When the floor goes tremble
Make a grown man cry
Oooh
I keep runnin' the tune at her
But the numbers never got exchanged
Every town, every city
Got a, a Miss Everything
Miss Everything (Miss everything)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
You know my story
I rocked a lot of crowds
Sold millions of records
I love my fans so loud
I got a thousand cars
And all hopes of bein'
A real superstar
I live super far
But none of that really matters
When I caught my eyes in Spain
She walked into me
Like you did your thing
In that Spanish accent
The one I love so much
She looked like an angel
One I wanted to touch
I blinked my eye for a second
And then she disappeared
When I see that Pretty Woman
I felt like Richard Gere
Boss dog ain't never been one to watch it pass
Unless we in they room, and they leave
And I watch that ass
But baby something else
Somehow I didn't speak
I been a player so long
Maybe I reached my peak
And now I'm on a plane
Feeling so ashamed
I didn't catch her name
So I call her Miss Everything

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Yah, you know my story
I seen a lot of hoes
A lot of gold diggers
Luda call them pros
I don't call them back
And thats just how it goes
Most people call me Snoopy
Or S-N-double-O
But none of that really matters
When I was in New York
I had a show at The Garden
You know, poppin' corks
That's when I seen her
From a distance
She smiled and froze
Now everything I learned in the game
Told me she chose
And I don't miss a beat
This time I gotta speak
She looked magnificent
Like something to eat
Hey co, I can't let her go
I made my way through the crowd
Let's get out of here
Head to Filipe Childs
Lotta stars in place
Doggy set the mood
I'm like "I like your style"
She's like "I like yours too"
Before I hit this plane
I gotta know your name
She smiled as if she came
Call me Miss Everything

[Hook x2]

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Lay low, getting' this weed money, me and my cous'
Yeah, you know how we do
But I wanna hold that baby for a minute now
See, about to knock 'er
See what it takes for her to be knocked
What it is, trip

[Hook: Snoop Dogg](x2)
Baby, what's yo' pleasure?
I be there for you, baby!
Even through stormy weather

[Verse 1: Daz Dillinger]
Huh, what did you prefer, let me accommodate
To get you turned up, to get your head straight
We started off with a quote, and now it's about an eighth
When you and Ali back, I blow it in ya face
I could tell that you high because you laughing
You took a dab of that wax girl, you blasting
She wants some cake in her system, she take a shot of that
Moscato with the lemon, yeah, with a shot of yeah
Man, that's a hell of a combination, put you on your back
She take three more shots, I said you dig that?
Now she in the mood tonight to get freaky
I can tell that she buzzing, she getting kinky
Yes, she loving 

[?] she take a dab
Its me and one girl and Snoop in dial

[?]
Hit the stormy weather, yeah, it's fifty below
We in a smoke storm, baby, light it up and let's go!

[Hook](x2)

[Bridge]
See, that's why we push it
And go faster
Tell me how to get it on
If you got the septic on the phone
We go and smoke it off to this door?

[Verse 2: Shon La Won]
Girl I wanna smoke wit ya
You wanna smoke wit me
The first time I'm feelin out your fantasy
It's the man in me
And the woman in you
To make us do the things we do
We got something in common
I don't know what it is
We can be lost or we can be free
Now I did like many ladies in my day
But just like the smoke, they got blown away
Like a glass of wine, sit back and rewind
But back into time, let the feeling rewind
Now, I don't know what it is and I don't know what it was
But it's DPG, me and my big cuz

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 1]
Snoop Dogg
They wonder how I do it, that's that big boy shit
5-7 clean, that's that big boy whip
State Seattles mean, that's them big boy kicks
The way I mack at a bitch, that's the big boy spit
King of the coach, yeah, I earned my due
Pimp hoes, pimp clothes, yeah, I earned that shoe
Been around the world, did my time in the pen
Niggas in gangbangs is back on them swings
So how could you ever disrespect my place?
Since '93 strong I was all in your face
Big shows in arenas, bitches picker than Trina
Party like rock stars at the bars where I seen her
Made my move closely, you owe me
I had you in the club for 10 years sipping slowly
To my shit classics and all it was was keeping it true
I brought the west back, what did you do?

[Hook](x2)
Ain't nobody better than me
True hood rock star in me
Ain't nobody better than me
S-S-N-double O-E

[Verse 2]
Slow motion in the fast lane
Feeling so alone blowing domes in the crap game
Sitting at the top of the game where you ain't
Got every type of car so now I just play the paint
Show after show, bank row in the Rolls
Living nice, big slice, got me slamming cans a doors
Three piece suit with a pocket watch
Snoop comin on

[?], you all riding chrome like you gotta stop soon
Did it the G way, he say, she say
Peer pressure to me, way to stop, bang in the seat way
I was the hog in the streets
Got in the game and broke the law on these beats
The slow flow killed and people said I rapped like I was chilling
Way above the stars, Snoop Dogg is top feeling
Plastics and all it was was keeping it true
I brought the west back, what did you do?

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 3]
Who get it like I done it? (Nobody)
You just in it, nigga, I run it
I gave life to the game and you behind on your bills
Like I can't get in your grill 'cause I live in the hills
Snoopie this, Snoopie that, yeah, I heard what you said
Ungrateful ass nigga, all the kids that I've fed
Young ass buster, let me see your ID
I just chunked up a bill passing VIP
I gave niggas a lane to represent that G-A-N-G-S-T-A on me
Been crippin', been pimpin', been doing the do
See me walking and that whole world doing it too
They play follow the leader, boss on the move
Shot down to the shoes, man I brunk on shoes
Cotis at the mall, I've been keeping it truth
I brought the west back, what the fuck did you do, nigga?

[Hook](x2)

[Intro]
You know I'm doin' big thangs for me
Got big thangs, you know what I mean?
You don't even understand it you know what I mean?
Big riches it's a blessin'
Anyway, check it out

[Hook]
And I ain't having big things, ain't it man?
You know I'm from a crip gang, ain't it man?
Ain't afraid to let my nuts hang, ain't it man?
And smoke a lot of mary jane, ain't it man?
And I never been in love before, ain't it man?
A gangsta nigga on his throne, ain't it man?
You know I'm doing big things, ain't it man?
You know I'm about that good thang, ain't it man?

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Twist up a swisha sweety put some foul in that bitch
Lets get wild
Lets get high
Come on, lets take a few hits
Sip some drink, count yo bank or do whatever you feel
Pop the top on yo lacker, is that a Snoopy deal?
It's got to be Monopoly it's how I play on this field
A quarterback with the sack, I got a team to build
A Dream to fill, scheme for mills, wheels and deals
Do how I feel, don't give a fuck how I feel
And that's for real
A lot of pimp niggas be poppin' up
Ever since me and Magic Juan made it popular
Pimpin' ain't easy, for sheezy, my neezy, cuff your breezy
And remember this nigga when you see me

[Pre-Hook]
You know I'm doing big things, ain't it man?
You know I'm from a crip gang, ain't it man?
Ain't afraid to let my nuts hang, ain't it man?
And I smoke a lot of mary jane, ain't it man?
Oh, waaaah, ain't it man? x8

[Verse 2: Kokane]
Jacob fella stay fly, everyday gaters laced up
I ain't thinking a pay cut, this beat is paper chaser
You work from 9 to 5, but I'mma keep a steady hustle
Yeah, we doin' big thangs, a nigga gotta have some muscle
Always keep it low, keepa ain't afraid to knuckle up
If ya disrespect my pimpin', tryna fuck my hustle up
I'm just here to kick game, get on the mike, spit flames
Big Snoop Dog with Kokane, ain't a man

[Verse 3: E-White]
Catch me lookin' flossy, I done hooked up wit the boss and
Where he got his share of thrust is not my fault
I'm handsome enough without the clothes and the 

[?]
But I'm rough, bossin' up on all them hoes, think I'm a star
I hustle and I call it like I see it, can't sleep
I need some money, stressed out, I'm about to fight
Bite off that weed or somethin'
To make it happen is the mission that they send me to get wit
Not all fall out dawg house, I represent this

[Hook x2]

[Verse 1]
Lose flash at eleven, eighty six box from the one they seven
New in Denver they beat the bust for ever
One call and make all your relatives forever
Plus your clowns sound funny, it's the deep out honey
Smash with a crash makwe you dash sound funny
So how the motherfucke you gonna pick your lips
To disrespect truth when I run with crips
And that move I know so un cut with it
If you ain't from the lane you never really did it
Pull it, five might make you call
And he burn your sould like stop dropping roll
And I've be there, I've done that, play it loud
Fall back motherfuckers get it off my could
Poof cush what a cuff that's the truth
When you smelling all the wide
Make it sure you crufed
Smach down we play no crack now
Off the blunt, sort of like crack down
Anywhere I please to fill, hop back into the way never see to drift
Capital weex stay screaming and use the mess
I scream no doubt, I spell the rest out
Into the O-O p that's way
Johnny low on my bumper like see your side

[Hook]
If you came here to bunty let me know it
But that don't mean this time just start to show it baby

[Verse 2]
Suddly you use the purpose, still will shut this down
Better move fast and catch it the nerve there
All guessed up from the kimped team blast
Black white fast, then leave you in the trash
Brain lay like truck please believ where you bump
West side it's the truck all we do is jump
At they point where you from don't matter
And all that gatters, gatters are gun doubetr
I sold you no limite boy grow on stable
Walk down but now remove now he rush the lable
You run your mouth that means you ain't able
Slaim diamonds then brak you brake your whole table
So ugly means muggy
But that 22 shoos on a brand new buggy
And that costy but money get main
Long be, sit with like leats to make it fame
So patch it if you want it, I suggest you post on it
Cuz when it's tured up fall back don't do me
We make it back ok drop it like it's hot
And bangel dummy, just cuz I might stop it if you not
Blue blazes, new faces, aliens from other space
Get bean from the laces

So again I'mma show you how to wrestle with one

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

[Intro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Our 12,500 closest friends in London are here, tonight
Making this such a beautiful sight to see
We're gonna play a- We're pleased
We're gonna play a b-side for you
Something that's not on the album
It made it onto the b-side of One Step Closer here, in the UK
Check it out, it's High Voltage

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I've been diggin' into crates, ever since I was living in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology and big bang theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology

Invented the mic so I could start blessing it
Chin-checking kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic cords in double helixes and show you what I'm made of

I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast a spell of instrumentalness on all of these MC's who hate us
(So you can try on) Leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity, let icons be bygones
I firebomb, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit, with or without an accomplice
Run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(High voltage) This is the unforgettable sound
(High voltage) Bringing you up and taking you down
(High voltage) Coming at you from every side
(High voltage) Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
(Akira) I put a kick in the backbones of clones with microphones
Never satisfy my rhyme jones
Spraying bright day over what you might say
My blood type's Krylon, technicolor type A

On highways, bright with road rage
Pages of wind in cages of tin that bounce all around
(Surround sound) Devouring the scene
Subliminal gangrene paintings, overall the same thing

Sing-song karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks-and-stone tactics
Fourth dimension combat convention
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention
Meant to put you away, with a pencil pistol official
Sixteen-line, the rhyme missile
While you risk your all, I pick out all your flaws
Spittin' rah blah blah blah, you can say you saw

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(High voltage) This is the unforgettable sound
(High voltage) Bringing you up and taking you down
(High voltage) Coming at you from every side
(High voltage) Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

(High voltage) This is the unforgettable sound
(High voltage) Bringing you up and taking you down
(High voltage) Coming at you from every side
(High voltage) Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

[Interlude: Chester Bennington]
Sometimes...
Sometimes...

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Sometimes, I feel like a prophet
Misunderstood, under the gun like a new disease
Sometimes, I feel like a prophet
Misunderstood, under the gun like a new disease

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(It's high voltage) This is the unforgettable sound
(High voltage) Bringing you up and taking you down
(High voltage) Coming at you from every side
(High voltage) Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

(High voltage) This is the unforgettable sound
(High voltage) Bringing you up and taking you down
(High voltage) Coming at you from every side
(High voltage) Yo everybody, put 'em up like this!

(High voltage) This is the unforgettable sound
(High voltage) Bringing you up and taking you down
(High voltage) Coming at you from every side
(High voltage) Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

(High voltage) This is the unforgettable sound
(High voltage) Bringing you up and taking you down
(High voltage) Coming at you from every side
(High voltage) Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

[Outro: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you guys very much!
Dilated peoples in the house!
Dilated peoples, ladies and gentlemen
Much respect
If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be travelling on now
There's just too many places I've got to see

But if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

And this bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I can't change

Bye bye, baby, it's been a sweet love yeah, yeah
And though this feeling I can't change
But please don't take this so badly
'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame

But if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And this bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I can't change
Lord, help me, I can't change

Lord, I can't change
Won't you fly high free bird?
Yeah
Pretty face, perfect frame, you got it going on
Model walk with that baby talk, you know, girl you got me gone
You so hard to hold onto and I'm really, really hanging on

My friends tell me I'm too far gone, and I really should be moving on
But all I can do, lately, is think about you, baby
All I can do, lately, is think about you, baby, yeah

Had this pretty little thing back home I can't seem to do nothing, no wrong
This really don't make no sense
After everything, my money spent she was so hard to hold onto
And I was really, really hanging on

My friend's said I was too far gone and I should have been moving along
'Cause all I can do, lately, is think about you, baby
All I can do, lately, is think about you, baby
All I can do, lately, is think about you, baby
All I can do, lately, is think about you, baby

This time she's leaving for sure
I know she won't be back no more
She left the key to my door
I'll be alone
All I can do, lately, is think about you, baby
All I can do, lately, is think about you, baby
All I can do, lately, is think about you, baby
Sorry if I was misleading
It's not the color of your hair or the clothes that you wear
Baby, you were there
Oh, baby, you were there
Baby, you were there
Baby, you were there
Oh, baby, you were there
Oh
It is what it is and that's all it'll be
We're just wasting time so it might as well be me
You can call it anything you wanna
Just friends, it's complicated
I'm not gonna
Pay no mind to your apathy
Oh, baby you were there
Baby, you were there
Baby, you were there
Oh, baby you were there

[Verse 1]
“Icy wind of night be gone this is not your domain”
In the sky a bird was heard to cry
Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds
Belied the deathly silence that lay all around

[Hook]
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer
Making for the sea

[Verse 2]
In the lazy water meadow I lay me down
All around me golden sun flakes settle on the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room

[Hook]
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer
Making for the sea

[Verse 3]
In the lazy water meadow I lay me down
All around me golden sun flakes covering the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room

[Hook]
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer
Making for the sea
(All): (Singing) Jingle bells...

(P): Hello, everybody, this is Paul, and I'd just like to thank you all for buying our records during the past year. We know you've been buying 'em because the sales have been very good, you see. Don't know where we'd be without you, really though

(J): In the army, perhaps

(P): Oh, we hope you've enjoyed listening to the records as much as we've enjoyed melting them - No, no, no, that's worng. - making them. We're in No. 2 studio at the moment, at EMI, taping this little message for you

(J): Yes, we are

(P): We are indeed. I just thought I'd make that... This is the same studio we've used all along - since the old days of "Love Me Do" - many years ago it seems, doesn't it?

(J): Ah, those were the days ...

(P): Well, that's about all, I think. Except, to wish you all a Happy Christmas and a very New Year! Now I'll pass you over to John. John!

(J): John. John speakin'. Thanks all of you who bought me book. Thank you folks for buying it. It was very handy. And there's another one out pretty soon, it says here. Hope you buy that, too. It'll be the usual rubbish but it won't cost much. You see, that's the bargain we're going to strike up. I write them in my spare time, it says here. It's been a busy year...

(P): Did you write this yourself?

(J): No! It's somebody's bad handwroter. It's been a busy year Beatle peadles, one way and another. But it's been a great year, too. You fans have seen to that. Page 2. Thanks a lot folks and a hap-py, ah, Christmas and a merry goo-year. Crimble maybe. And I'll hand you to George who will speak to you - now!
(G): Thank you John. Thank you. Hi there! I'd like to thank all of you for going to see the film. 'spect a lot of you saw it more than once

(R): I did

(G): Did you? So did I. Thanks anyway. 'Cause it makes us very pleased, ya know. We had a quiet time making it. Actually, we didn't. We had a great time making it. And we're glad it turned out okay. The next one should be completely different. We start shooting it in February. This time it's gonna be in color

(J): Green

(G): It'll be a big laugh we hope. (Ha ha ha!) Well, we ... Big laugh, ha ha ha, yeah, it'll be a big laugh

(J): Be a big laugh, you imagine?

(G): And we may see all of you soon. Hope so anyway. All the best. And, happy New Year. And a Happy Christmas. And here's Ringo!

(R): Thanks, Geroge. Ringo here. Well, the others have thanked you for the discs and John's book and for everything - oh, no - for enjoying the film. I'd like to thank you just for being fans. It's been a funny year, you know. One minute we're in England, next, we're away. 'spect you're wondering where we've been. Well, Beatle people, we've been to Australia and America and New (*crash*) - who's dropping that? - New Zealand and Australia...

(P): And New Zealand

(R): Ha ha! Or is that New Zealand? So much travelling! But you've stayed loyal, haven't you? Anyway, those airport receptions knocked us out, man, great!

(J): Dig!

(R): Well, that's about it from me. I'd just like to say, all the best for Christmas and happy new year. That's about it

(All) (Singing):
Oh, can you wash your father's shirt
Can you wash it clean?
Oh, can you wash your father's shirt
Can you wash it clean?
Oh, can you wash your father's shirt
Can you wash it clean? Oo

That mean ole, mean ole Frisco
And that long train, the Santa Fe
Yes, they've taken my baby away
And they blew back after me

I ain't got no, I ain't got nobody here
I ain't got no, I ain't got nobody here
Well, if I don't hear from her soon
I think I'll leave myself

Oh, I wonder
Do she ever think of me?
Yes, I wonder
Do my baby think of me?
Well, she should be worried
And should hurry back home to me

Well, if you see my baby
Tell her I need her bad
Oh, if you see my baby
Tell her I need her bad
Well, since she left me
Seems I've lost every friend I have
I've been tryin' not to worry
And tryin' to do the best I can
I've been tryin' not to worry
And tryin' to do the best I can
But now since she's gone
I'm a lonely lonely man
Where do you live? In a brownstone
Or an apartment house, a thousand feet tall?
Where do you live? In a penthouse?
Well, to be honest, I don't envy you at all
'Cause I have a house, far from the city
It may be mighty small, but it's awful pretty

Just an old stone house by a river
With an old dirt road running by
There's a tabby cat and a welcome mat
And a blessed sun in the sky

Just an old stone house by a river
With a few good friends dropping in
There's some big old trees and a gentle breeze
And a little boy with a grin

Oh yes, this is the place for me
Oh yes, this is the place to be
The valley and the flowers, the long peaceful hours
And beauty for any eye to see
Just an old stone house by a river
And a door without any key
Just a friendly place for a friendly face
Just an old stone house and me

Just a friendly place for a friendly face
Just an old stone house and me
After many tears fall from your eyes
A thousand times you ask yourself why
The one guy you love has departed, oh yeah
You're left alone and brokenhearted
Love just comes and goes
How long it's gonna last nobody knows, oh oh

That's the way love is, baby
That's the way love is

I know you're walkin' down a lonesome road, girl
And your heart's carryin' a heavy load
I know you feel like you ain't got a friend
And your whole world's cavin' in
Listen to me, now's the time to be strong
You've gotta forget him, woo-hoo, now that he's gone
Remember...

That's the way love is, baby
That's the way love is
Let me run somethin' down to you, baby
Love can be a hurting thing
And it can be as warm as a person's scream
When love is present, everything is alright
But when it's gone you toss and turn all night

The road of love is rough sometimes
Don't let it get the best of you
Said I've been hurt by love so many times
So I know just what you're goin' through
I bet you wish that you were never born
You've got to forget him, ooh, now that he's gone
Remember...

That's the way love is, baby
That's the way love is, ooh

Love is here today, gone tomorrow
All your joys turn to sorrow
(That's the way love is)
Ooh, one day gladness, the next day sadness
That's the way love is, sho'nuff, how it is
(That's the way love is)
Love just comes and goes
How long it's gonna last, nobody knows
Ordained for proclaimin' the gospel of Jesus
The great super preachers go crusadin' on
And the people all gather in big congregations
They hear of the Saviour who came to atone
And they kneel at the altar and they walk away happy
Then the devil starts gossip about money and sex
Makin' it hard on the good men of God like Billy and Bob and Oral and Rex
Old Billy Sunday is dead and gone young Jim Robertson's comin' on strong
And Billy and Rex and Oral and Bob are talkin' about Jesus and doin' their job

Millions of people tune in Katherine Coolman
And see her face shine with an unearthly light
Garner Ted warns of the world of tomorrow
But they criticized him and the reverend died
'Cause the devil is after the great super preachers
He'd try to discredit the gospel they bring
But Billy and Rex and Oral and Bob hold to their commitment to Jesus the King
Old Billy Sunday is dead and gone young Tommy Barnett is comin' on strong
And Billy and Rex and Oral and Rex are talkin' about Jesus and doin' their job
Old Billy Sunday is dead and gone young Jimmy Snow is comin' on strong
And Billy and Rex and Oral and Bob are talkin' about Jesus and doin' their job
Express 

[?] reality was spurning those
Who may cuss, take it for what it's not
Different languages full of riches
To reveal what's real and concrete

His connection
His true life, the spirit
Beware the swamp
Takes our will to create

Reality has been diverted
Unscrupulously manipulated
Unbridled exercise of power
The fascist urge to control all
On what we think, to our intimacy
Our bodies turn to commodities

Hypocrisy of our time
So in love with freedom
Who really wants it dead
Yes, I object to be made an object
No site for your deflection of power

Hypocrisy of our time
So in love with freedom
Who really wants it dead

We treat our bodies like machines
Fascism winning
We treat our bodies like machines
Fascism within

[Verse 1]
Lil' darlin', gotta go now
Don't know when I'll be coming back
Got my future all planned out
Got my bags packed
Things don't always turn out right
But that's just the way it goes
Before I leave you, there's just a few
Things you should know

[Chorus]
Don't talk to strangers
Don't forget to say your prayers at night
Remember God - He made you
And one day He'll make everything alright
Don't cross on the yellow
You always got to wait for a green light
Remember God - He made you
And one day He'll make everything alright

[Verse 2]
Lil' darlin', gotta go now
Don't worry, you'll be just fine
When it comes to good luck
I just know you'll always be first in line
Nobody will ever love you as much as I do
But that doesn't mean other people won't love you, too

[Chorus]
Don't talk to strangers
Don't forget to say your prayers at night
Remember God - He made you
And one day He'll make everything alright
Don't cross on the yellow
You always got to wait for a green light
Remember God - He made you
And one day He'll make everything alright
Alright
Make everything alright
Alright

[Outro]
Little darling
Gotta go now
Got my future all planned out
Before I go
Don't talk to strangers
Don't forget to say your prayers at night
Remember God he made you
One day he'll make everything alright

[Verse 1]
Give me the price to pay
To stay in this game you play
Although your game is strong
Move on, the heat is on

[Chorus]
Ha-ha the heat is on, yeah, ah, the heat is on
Hey you better keep movin' on, hey-hey, the heat is on

[Verse 2]
Undercover you hide away
Layin' back to make your play
The bigger the thrill, the better the song
Move on, the heat is on

[Chorus]
Ah, the heat is on; ah, the heat is on
Hey, you better keep movin' on, the heat is on

[Bridge]
Can you feel it-yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
The charge of love is on the way
Make it easy, make me stay
In case you can't hang on
Move on, the heat is on

[Chorus]
Well, the heat is on, I can feel the heat is on
That's why I keep movin' on, I know the heat is on

[Verse 4]
When lightnin' strikes—thunder breaks
And in a flash, you're on your way
And if you're tryin' to lead me on
Move on, the heat is on

[Chorus]
Ah, the heat is on; hey, the heat is on
Hey, you better keep movin', movin' on, said the heat is on

[Bridge]
I can feel that the heat, feel that the heat is on
I'm movin', y'all see me movin' on

[Guitar solo]

[Outro]
Yeah! I can feel the heat, I can feel that the heat is on
I keep my feet movin', you see me movin' on
I can feel that the heat, ha-ha, ha-ha, the heat is on
Movin', see me movin' on
Ain't you feelin' a little heat, ah, the heat is on
Keep movin', oh, I'm movin' on
I can feel that the heat, feel that the heat is on
Keep movin', oh, movin' on
I can feel that the heat, I said the heat is on
I keep my feet movin', ah, movin' on
I can feel the heat, I can feel the heat
I can feel the heat, I can feel the heat, yeah
I can feel the heat, yeah, said the heat
She was a level-headed dancer on the road to alcohol
I was just a soldier on my way to Montreal
Well, she pressed her chest against me about the time the jukebox broke
She give me a peck on the back of the neck and these are the words she spoke

Blow up your TV, throw away your paper
Go to the country, build you a home
Plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches
Try and find Jesus on your own

I sat there at the table and I acted real naive
Cause I knew that topless lady, she had something up her sleeve
She danced around the room awhile and she did the hoochy cooch
Yea sing a song all night long tellin' me what to do

Blow up your TV, throw away your paper
Go to the country, build you a home
Plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches
Try and find Jesus on your own

But I was young and hungry and about to leave that place
Just as I was going she looked me in the face
I said "You must know the answer", she said "No, but I'll give it a try"
And to this day we've been livin' our way, here is the reason why
We blew up the TV, threw away the paper
Went to the country, built us a home
Had a lotta children, fed 'em on peaches
They all found Jesus on their own
I've got my questionaire
Aand they need me in the war
I've got my questionaire
Aand they need me in the war
Yes, if I have to commit murder
Won't have to (???)

I want the thirty two-twenty
Made on a forty-five frame
I want the thirty two-twenty
Made on a forty-five frame
And a red, white and blue fag
Wear it in my right hand

Yeah, you can tell my baby
Tell her to please wait for me
Yeah, you can tell my baby
Tell her to please wait for me
Well I meet her one mornin'
Down by that old Red Sea
All the boys are buzzing since I introduced my cousin Louella
Count them by the dozen as they swarm around my cousin Louella
The way they sigh when she walks by, you'd think she was a movie queen
They never saw such charm before, not even on a movie screen
Like the bees a-buzzing for some honey from my cousin Louella
Everyone's supposin' he'd be chosen as the fortunate fellow
But will they shout when they find out my cousin will be leaving soon
Louella only came to town to get herself a pretty gown for her honeymoon

All the boys are buzzing since I introduced my cousin Louella
Count them by the dozen as they swarm around my cousin Louella
The way they sigh when she walks by, you'd think she was a movie queen
They never saw such charm before, not even on a movie screen
Like the bees a-buzzing for some honey from my cousin Louella
And everyone's supposin' he'd be chosen as the fortunate fellow
But will they shout when they all find out my cousin will be leaving soon
Louella only came to town to get herself a pretty gown for her honeymoon
I see some good times, I gotta get to ring that bell
I gotta see some good times
Sometimes you make up for when I'm not feeling well
It must be due to some great times
Cause right now I feel like hell

Never trust a woman who wears her pants too tight
She might love you tomorrow, but she'll be gone tomorrow night

Come tomorrow I'll get my pay to leave this town
She don't really love me
Ain't no reason to stick around

[Intro]
Hey yo, R
Let me handle my business
I just wanna take over the show for a minute
Not the whole show, just a little bit

[Verse 1]
Now that he's outta the way
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Can I break it down and break you off
Some of this computer lovin' type of shit?
Lookin' at you from the inside of this internet
I'm in the mood, and my tongue is in the mood
Ladies, can we have a little fun?
Can we play a little game?
Said, can we have a little fun?
Can we play a little game?

[Interlude]
I got something for y'all
Can I give it to you?

[Chorus]
Now listen, second Kelly what you got for me, y'all say
I got some down low, down low, sing it for me
Now second Kelly, what you got for me, y'all say
I got some 12 play, 12 play, sing it
Now 2nd Kelly, what you got for me, sing
I got some bump and grind, bump and grind, sing it y'all
Now second Kelly, what you got for me, say
Do you mind if I stroke you up
Do you mind if I stroke you down

[Interlude]
Ladies, ladies, tell me do you want more?
I said do you want more?
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na sing

[Verse 2]
Now y'all having fun?
Too bad it's time for me to get up out of here
But before I do
I wanna blow the roof off this place with this last one
Are y'all ready?
All right, now everybody let me hear you say
Ooh na na na na na na
Ooh na na na na na na
Yeah, now, that was loud, right?
But I think y'all can get a little louder
If y'all what Kelly to come back out here

Y'all do it louder come on here we go, come on
Ooh na na na na an na what
Ooh na na na na na na

[Outro]
I know y'all must be trippin' on me
Damn
I wanna go half on a baby

[Verse 1]
Bells will be ringing this sad sad New Years
Oh, what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone, I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again
Cries will be singing Silent Night
Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
(Please come home)
Please come home for Christmas
(Please come home)
If not for Christmas by New Years night

[Bridge]
Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas, yes, Christmas my dear
It's the time of year to be with the ones you love
Ooh ooh

[Verse 2]
So won't you tell me you'll never more roam
Christmas and New Years will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief, and pain
And I'll be happy, happy once again

[Outro]
Oh, there'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, Christmas once again
Oh, there'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, Christmas once again
Right now we'd like to do for you
The first slow song the Beach Boys recorded
It's called "Surfer Girl"

Little Surfer, little one
Made my heart come all undone
Do you love me, do you Surfer Girl?
(Surfer Girl, my little Surfer Girl)

I have watched you on the shore
Standing by the ocean's roar
Do you love me, do you Surfer Girl?
(Surfer Girl, Surfer Girl)

We could ride the surf together
While our love would grow
In my Woody I would take you
Everywhere I go

So I say from me to you
I will make your dreams come true
Do you love me, do you Surfer Girl?
(Surfer Girl, my little Surfer Girl)
Little one, aa-aah
(Girl, Surfer Girl, my little Surfer Girl)
Little one, aa-aah
(Girl, Surfer Girl, my little Surfer Girl)

Are we alright down there?
You OK? Is she alright?
Brian

It wouldn't be nothin' pleasant if she catch us
Or find them dirty love letters
Or them pictures of you in sexy teddies
She knows it's heavy breathin' when we finish
Legs and shit gonna be numb
And you gonna be so

But I swear darlin', I done begged that bitch to stop callin'

Besides shit, we ain't married, I ain't got nothin' to hide
If I'd fucked, I could've told ya, she said,â€ Ya ain't gotta lieâ€
Just for your information I walked down the street on the side
When you and that bitch was gettin' outta dodge
I already found out you's a rapper so I should'nt be surprised
I guess I had to see it with my own two eyes
I said, â€½What the hell, F.B.I., she a spyâ€
Girl, pull that fuckin' skin back and call me circumsized
She said,â€ Yea, you make me laugh but you make me cry
And I done put up with shit, them trifflin' hoes and I'm tiredâ€
I said, â€½what you tryin' to say"
She said, "I would just let you slide but I got my pride
I love you Michael but this is goodbye, you all know whyâ€
The bitch been sleepin' with me

And being that I'm happily unmarried with no attachments
A black bachelor with cabbage
Bitches be throwin' pussy at me
Baby, you nasty
But put your number in my bepper and I'll pick you up Saturday
She said, â€½Saturdays, bad, I'm off Sundayâ€
I said, â€½Sunday I gotta got to the studio, I'll hook up with you Mondayâ€
She said, â€½Damn, honey, Monday, I'm a have my son
And Tuesday I got an appointment at the salon to get my hair doneâ€

I ain't got no chil'ren but Mystikal love the kidsâ€
She said, â€½That's cool, I'm free Wednesday where you live

But she pulled up with a fine ass friend
She said, â€½My girlfriend gotta go to the bathroom badâ€

Payday (measures and Breaks)

By Credits (Boz Scaggs/David Faich)
Hey you steppin' on my head
Why you gotta throw rocks in my bed
Mr. Shoeshine, could you kindly keep it down
Do we really need an Apocalypse right now?

Where's my sunshine, Sunshine was my friend
She was good to me, right up to the end
Where I left her, well it's hard to tell
Got to call, just a soon as I get well

Come payday'
Everybody gets strange
Talking 'bout my Payday, hey hey
Better get out my way, baby

I don't mind a job, work's no big deal
It's just how they treat you, how they make you feel
I'll take my check, you take your mood
Let's just say, whatever man, whatever gets you through
Come payday'
Blow those blues away, boy
Talking 'bout my Payday, hey hey
Don't be waitin' up for me

Brothers, Sisters
Tonite we party, tonite we're dancin'
Hey, we're talkin' the ultimate smash of a lifetime

This one's on me'..

(Solos) ( 8-10 measures)

Sometime's it like a war in here, Face the night alone
But ever since I work up, felt it in my bones
Waiting for that hour's all that keeps me clear
There's gonna be some lightnin' strike when I get outta here

(quiet bass/guitar/drums) Cause it payday, y'all
Better stay out my way
Talking 'bout some hey day, hey hey
Man it's all comin' home

Payday, gonna shake it all down tonite
Payday, Gonna do my dance tonite
I come from just the other side of nowhere
To this big time lonesome town
They got a lot of ice and snow here
Half as cold as all the people I've found
Every way I try to go here
Somebody is always trying to bring me down
I've seen about enough to know where I belong

I've got a mind to see the headlights shining
On that old white line between my heart and home
Sick of spendin' sundays wishing they were mondays
Sittin' in a park alone
Give my best to anyone who's left who ever done me
Any lovin' way but wrong
And tell 'em that the pride of just the other side o nowhere's
Goin' home

Takin' nothin' back to show there
For these dues that I've paid
But the soul I almost sold here
And the body I've been givin' away
Fadin' from the neon nighttime glow here
Headin' for the light of day
Just the other side of nowhere, goin' home
I've got a mind to see the headlights shinin'
On that old white line between my heart and home
Sick of spendin' sundays wishin' they were mondays
Sittin' in a park alone
Give my best to anyone who's left who ever done me
Any lovin' way but wrong
And tell them that the pride of just the other side of nowhere's
Goin' home
Just the other side on nowhere, goin' home

[Verse 1]
Oh pity us here we angels of lead
We're dead, we're sick hanging by thread
Get real
Get real

[Verse 2]
You can't stop meaningful teenage cries
From deep behind fifty year old eyes
Get real
Get real

[Chorus 1]
I'm scared to touch
Too tense to be undone
I walk the streets
Not expecting morning sun
Against the voice of doom
Failures fall all over town

[Post-Chorus 1]
I guess I should
I feel I should
Get real
Get real

[Verse 3]
What's up?
What happened when I wasn't around?
Who did what?
What went down?
Get real
Get real

[Verse 4]
Think about myself it happens to me
It happens in the tunnel when I let myself feel
Get real
Get real

[Chorus 2]
I'm scared to touch
Too tense to be undone
I walk the streets
Not expecting morning sun
I feel it all through breakdowns falling all over town

[Post-Chorus 2]
I feel I should
I guess I should
Get real
Get real
Get real
Get real

[Verse 5]
The dazzle of light
The rape of life
The seed, the curse
The jazz of life
Get real
Get real

[Outro]
Get real
Get real
I have the blues before sunrise
With tears standin' in my eyes
I have the blues before sunrise
Tears standin' in my eyes
It's such a miserable feelin'
A feelin' I do despise

Seems like everybody
Everybody's down on me
Seems like everybody
Everybody's down on me
I am gonna cast my problems
Down in the deep blue sea

Oh, today's been such a long lonesome day
Today's been, day's been
Such a long lonesome day
I've been just sittin' here thinkin'
With my mind a million miles away

The blue starts rollin'
And they stopped in the front of my door
Blues are rollin'
And they stopped at my front door
I'm gonna change my way of livin'
And I ain't gonna worry no more, no more

[Intro]
Uh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh
Aw yeah

[Verse 1]
Hair so smooth, black as coal
Aw, baby, the way you sway
You wear the dress so very blue, that you take my blues away
She comes and goes, that I know, aw
She cums at least once a day
I can't resist, I kiss your lips
You're my sexy Mexican maid

[Chorus]
She cums
She cums
She cums
Lemme please get on my knees (She cums)
I come alone

[Verse 2]
When I wake up in the morn', she greets me where I lay
I look outside to find that it's a bright and sunny day
So serene, she gives to me my toast and marmalade
What more can I say? She's my sexy Mexican maid

[Verse 3]
She puts me in a bubble bath
She tickles me, and I laugh
She washes me until I'm clean, then she does a little sexy dance
Happy to feel my hand go slap upon her sexy ass
We make fun so very slow, then we make it very fast
...
Try me
Try me, little girl
We could raise a family

Well they treat you like a dummy
Well they treat you like a slave
Nothin' bout what you said, it's all
What you gave
Try me

Try me, little girl
We could raise a family

Well, they treat so low
At the time I'll ring out of way
Oh, nika tho nika, three's gotta you gonna way

Based on cell she is sittin' on room

[** feat. Rihanna:]

[Chorus: ~Rihanna~]
You're gonna be a shining star*
Your fancy clothes, your fancy ca-ars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you a-are
So live your life (ay), ay ay ay
You instead of chasing at paper
Just live your life (oh), ay ay ay
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (ay), ay ay ay
No telling where it'll take ya
Just live your life (oh), ay ay ay
'Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)
Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)

[Verse 1: ~T.I.~]
Never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungreatful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paid the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wasting days away, now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protégé, homage I think they should pay
Instead of being gracious they violate in a major way
I never been a hater still I love them in a crazy way
Some say they sold yah and no they couldn't even work on Labor day
It ain't that they black or white, their hands in areas the shades of grey
I'm west side anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me want to melt their face away
Like I once made them spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thugging all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You would rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

[Chorus: Rihanna]
You're gonna be a shining star
Your fancy clothes, your fancy ca-ars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you a-are
So live your life (ay), ay ay ay
You instead of chasing at paper
Just live your life (oh), ay ay ay
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (ay), ay ay ay
No telling where it'll take ya
Just live your life (oh), ay ay ay
'Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)
Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I'm the opposite of moderate
Immaculately polished with the spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever having problems with their record sales just holla 'tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow 'tip
I got love for the game but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame and rappers nowadays are comically
The hooting and the hollering, back and forth with the arguing
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositing
Them checks into your bank account and you up out of poverty
Your values is in disarray, prioritizing horribly
Unhappy with the riches 'cause you piss poor morally
Ignoring all prior advice and fore warning
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

[Chorus: Rihanna]
You're gonna be a shining star
Your fancy clothes, your fancy ca-ars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you a-are
So live your life (ay), ay ay ay
You instead of chasing at paper
Just live your life (oh), ay ay ay
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (ay), ay ay ay
No telling where it'll take ya
Just live your life (oh), ay ay ay
'Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)
Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)

[Verse 3: Rihanna]
Got everybody watching what I do
Come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm living if you really want to
Got my mind on my money and I'm not going nowhere
So keep on getting your paper and keep on climbing
Look in the mirror and keep on shining
'Till the game ends, 'till the clock stops
We gon' post up on the top spot
Living the life, the life
In a brand new city got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do what I wanna do
I'm living my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm living my life, my life
And I'm not stopping
So live your life!
The lips of the righteous teach many
But fools die for want of wisdom
The rich man wealth is in his city;
Do you hear, do you hear, can you understa-and?!
Destruction of the poor, is poverty;
Destruction of the soul, is vanity
The righteous' wealth is in his Holy Pla-ace
Do you hear?
Those who have eyes, to see will see!
/break/
The rich man wealth is in his city;
Do you hear, do you believe, do you understand?!
Destruction of the poor is poverty
Destruction of the soul is vanity
Well hear me children!
The righteous' wealth is in his Holy Pla-ace!

[Verse 1]
Come all you lads of high renown
That would hear of a fair young maiden
She roved out on a summer's day
For to view the soldiers paradin'
They marched so bold and they looked so gay
Their colors flyin' and the bands did play
And it caused young Mary for to say
"I'll wed you my gallant soldier"

[Verse 2]
She viewed the soldiers on parade
And as they stood at their leisure
Mary to herself did say
"At last I've found my treasure"
"But oh, how cruel my parents must be
Banishing my darling so far from me
Well I'll leave them all and I'll go with thee
My bold undaunted soldier"

[Verse 3]
"Oh Mary dear, your parents' love
I pray don't be unruly
For when you're in a foreign land
Believe me you'll rue it surely
Perhaps in battle I might fall
From a shot from an angry cannonball
And you so far from your daddy's hall
Be advised by a gallant soldier."

[Verse 4]
"If I have fifty guineas in bright gold
Likewise a heart that's blunder
And I'd leave them all and I'll go with you
My bold undaunted soldier
So don't say no but let me go
And I will face the daring foe
We'll march together to and fro
I'll wed you my gallant soldier."

[Verse 5]
And when he saw her loyalty
And Mary so true-hearted
He said, "My darling, married we'll be
And nothin' but death will part us
And when we're in some foreign land
I'll guard you, darling, with my right hand
Hopes that God might stand a friend
To Mary and her gallant soldier"

[Chorus]
I guess I'll always love you
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need

[Verse 1]
Open up your arms (Open up your arms)
And let me walk on in
Open up your heart (Open up your heart)
And let me live again
When you left, you left with me
A dream no longer reality
I live in the shadows of our past
With this love that was born to last

[Chorus]
I guess I'll always love you
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need

[Chorus]
The only time I'm happy (The only time I'm happy)
Is when you're on my mind
Every day I live
More of the love to you I give
I've been a thousand places
Seen your smile on a thousand faces
No matter what I try to do (No matter what I do)
I'm always dreaming of you

[Chorus]
I guess I'll always love you
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need

[Verse 3]
Every girl that passes by
I see your sparkle in her eye
Right away I stop and stare
Close my eyes and see you there
Whenever I feel almost free
Old memories start taking hold of me
I love you now so much more
Than I ever did before

[Outro]
I guess I'll always love you
I guess I'll always love you
I guess I'll always love you

[Spoken Intro]
You know, love can be strange sometimes
As a man goes through life looking for that special someone
To stick by his side for a lifetime
Now and then, some of us
We struggle a little for that love thing that we seek
And what we wanna know right now is this

[Verse 1]
As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
'Cause happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion

[Chorus]
What becomes of the brokenhearted?
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind, maybe

[Verse 2]
The roots of love grow all around
But for me, they come tumbling down (Come tumbling down)
Every day, heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer
I walk in shadows, searching for light
Cold and alone, no comfort in sight (No comfort in sight)
Hoping and praying for someone to care
Always moving but going nowhere

[Chorus]
What becomes of the brokenhearted?
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind, maybe

[Verse 3]
I'm searching though I don't succeed
But someone else has a growing need (A growing need)
All is lost, there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

[Chorus]
Now what becomes of the brokenhearted?
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind

[Outro]
I'll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone to care
I'll be looking everyday
I know I'm gonna find a way
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I'll find a way somehow
Got to find her, got to find her, got to find her
Oh, I'll be searching
Got to find her, got to find her, got to find her
Oh, I'll be searching
Got to find her, got to find her, got to find her
Oh, I'll be searching
Got to find her, got to find her, got to find her
Oh, I'll be searching
Got to find her, got to find her, got to find her
Oh, I'll be searching
Got to find her, got to find her, got to find her
Oh, I'll be searching
Jesus, Jesus
Oh
What a wonderful child
Jesus, Jesus
So lowly meek and mild
New life, new hope
New joy He brings
Won't you listen
To the angels sing
Glory, glory, glory
To the new born King
Jesus, Jesus
Oh
What a wonderful child
Jesus, Jesus
So lowly meek and mild
New life, new hope
New joy He brings
Won't you listen
To the angels sing
Glory, glory, glory
To the new born King
He was herald
By the angels
Born
In a lowly manger
The virgin Mary
Was His mother
And Joseph
Was his earthly father
Three wise men
Came from afar
They were guided
Bby a shining star
To see King Jesus
Where He lay
In a manger
Filled with hay
Jesus, Jesus
Oh
What a wonderful child
Jesus, Jesus
So lowly meek and mild
Oh new life, new hope
New joy He brings
Won't you listen
To the angels sing
Glory
To the new born King
Oh, Jesus
Jesus
Mary's baby
Lamb of God
Heavenly Child
Jesus
Jesus
I Love Him
Oh, Jesus
All Mighty God
King of kings
Oh Jesus
Oh Jesus
Oh, oh, oh, Jesus
Wonderful
Wonderful one
Oh, oh
Oh, Jesus
Oh, Jesus
Son of God
Oh, Jesus
Glory
To the new born King
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Who will be a guest in your tent?
Certainly not the ones who don't wanna repent
And keep giving guns to the poorest of our nation's sons

Who is gonna call you by name?
With no confusion, trinity or preacher's vain?
Who says that everytime
And opens up the eyes of the blind

Who will be the one in his bed?
Certainly not the ones who put thorns on his head
And wish him dead while they took his daily bread

[Chorus]
Which one is of value to you?
The one depleting the oil supply
Or the One that renews it
And keeps the peace
Like the groove in Sade's "Sweetest Taboo"

[Hook]
Give it to me, give it to me, the sweetest
(the sweetest)
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me, the sweetest

[Verse 2]
Who will be a guest in your tent?
Are you gonna be happy with how your life has been spent?
Did you have open arms for each and everybody you met?

Or did you let them die in the rain?
Endless war, poverty or hurricane
Then it's time for another groove
Like Sade's "Sweetest Taboo"

[Hook]

[x2]
Give it to me, give it to me, the sweetest
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me, the sweetest
Cherise was brushing her long hair gently down
It was the afternoon of carnival
As she brushes it gently down
Reuben was strumming his painted mandolin
It was inlaid with a pretty face in jade
Played the carnival parade

Cherise was dressing as Pirouette in white
When a fatal vision gripped her tight
Cherise beware tonight
Reuben, Reuben, tell me truly true
I feel afraid and I don't know why I do
Is there another girl for you?

If you could see my heart, you would know it's true
There's none Cherise, except for you, except for you
I'd swear to it on my very soul
If I lie, may I fall down cold

Reuben was strumming his painted mandolin
The breeze would pause to listen in
Before going on its way again
Masquerade began when nightfall finally woke
Like waves against the bandstand, dancers broke
To the painted mandolin
Looking out on the crowd, who is standing there
Sweet Ruby Claire at Reuben stared, at Reuben stared
She was dressed as Pirouette in red
And her hair hung gently down

The crowd pressed round, Ruby stood as though alone
Reuben's song took on a different tone
And he played it just for her
The song that he played was the carnival parade
Each note cut a thread of Cherise's fate
It cut through like a blade

Reuben was strumming his painted mandolin
When Ruby froze and turned to stone
For the strings played all alone
The voice of Cherise from the face of the mandolin
Singing Reuben, Reuben tell me true
For I have no one but you

If you could see my heart, you would know it's true
There's none Cherise, except for you, except for you
I'd swear to it on my very soul
If I lie, may I fall down cold

The truth of love an unsung song must tell
The course of love must follow blind
Without a look behind
Reuben walked the streets of New Orleans 'til dawn
Cherise so lightly in his arms
And her hair hung gently down

[Instrumental]
I'm trippin' over dumb drunks at a party
Girlfriend just ran off with the DJ
I give her everything, but she refused it
It doesn't matter, she don't know how to use it
My confidence is dwindling
Look at the shape I'm in
Where's my pearls, where's my swine?
I'm not thirsty, but I'm standing in line

I'll have the usual
I'll have the usual
Fifty silhouettes bumpin' on the dance floor
Pink elephants fallin' through a trap door
Sixty cigarettes a day 'cause I'm nervous
When will that bitch serve us?

I used to be a good boy, livin' the good life
Fifty thousand kisses later she was a housewife
She was good, I was unkind
I'm not thirsty, but I'm standin' in line
I'll have the usual
I'll have the usual
(On the rocks)
(Two ice cubes)
(And a little umbrella)

Big Jim says the second comin's comin'
I think he's just seein' double or something
Or something

You can hang around waiting for the also rans
I can't win, but I've seen enough, man
A fifth of whiskey he could knock it away
I drink some more and it's judgment day
I had a future, but she just passed out
I'm gonna drink until I see what it is I wanna think about

I'll have the usual
I'll have the usual
I'll have the usual
On the rocks
With a twist
You're lonely and I'm lonely
So why can't we be lonely together?
The night is young and while it grows older
We can't forget crying on each other's shoulder

The sky's cloudy 'cause we're lonely
But soon we'll see a change in the weather
Two lonely hearts beating as one
Can be miserable and still have a lot of fun

[Intro:]
You know what, I'm ma make it do what it do baby
I'm ma make it do what it do baby

[Verse 1:]

Clearly we won't know unless we try
The possibilities are open
To create a new situation
Surely we won't know unless we try
I am far too young to die
Tell me about the general people
My belly's bursting without a...
And who are the general people?
Just a grain of sense that you confess
I have regrets if I die
Refuge in superstitions and dreams
Toying with the imaginary
Memory becomes a luxury
Refuge in superstitions and dreams
It's no way to make History
No we won't know, we won't know
We won't know unless we try
Let it go
Wha, cmon
Somebody say heeeyyy
Im just playin

Before Palmdale, we use to stay
Deep in the hood where they sell yay
I seen a gangbanger walk by real fast
Brand new khakis hangin off his ass
At first, i didn't like the chump
Cause he looked like he needed to go take a dump
But everybody sag in the hood
Pretty soon, it started lookin good
1987 i started stoppin my mama from doin my school shoppin
Mama, love you right
But these wranglers too dam tight
Stay home, cook something to eat
Daddy, take me to the SWAP meet
Walkin through the SWAP meet wit a jerri curl
Tryn to get somethin from the home girl
Joseph, i love you right
But them wranglers is too dam tight
Okay ima give you a chance
But first...
(Chorus:) (2x)
Sag yo pants
Do that gangsta dance

Walk, walk, walk, walkowww

Who invited saggin, take a guess
I dont know but he from the west
Remember them old school rappers right
Like run dmc, they pants was tight
Dont get me wrong, i luv N. W.A
But they wasn't saggin the right way
Saggin come from the L.A. streets
SWAP meets, old school beats
Move to the suburbs of Palmdale
Kept on saggin hard as hell
Had a cool step, plus a bad rep
Didn't fit in with the preppy prep
They crack little jokes, look down they nose
But now they smoke weed and wear baggy clothes
Play rap music, dance and drink beer
Shit we been doin for years

(Chorus:) (2x)
Sag yo pants
Do that gangsta dance
Walk, walk, walk, walkowww

I sag my daddy, i sag my mama
I got to bed and sag my pajama
Sag at home, sag in church
Sag wit the homies in the police search
Sag at work, sag at school
Sag in the airport fool
Sag when i stayin, sag when i bail
Sag when i out the county jail
Sag in the SWAP meet, sag in court
Sag when i hop out the super sport
Sag when im playin basket ball
"pull yo pants up joey" hell naw
Sag wit my kids, sag wit my wife
I can't stop saggin, ima sag for life
Fist Palmdale sager, i dont bang
But i still let, my khakis hang
Sag bold, sag nervous
Sag when im doin community service
Sag when i mac, sag when i brawl
I bet ya my pants dont fall

(Chorus:) (2x)
Sag yo pants
Do that gangsta dance
Walk, walk, walk, walkowww
Yea,yea
Pull em up, pull em up, pull em down B-CAAA
Ooowww yeeaa
Let me get them size 46, yea B-CAAAA

[Intro: Jimi Hendrix]
Happy new year first of all. I hope we'll have million or two million more of them... if we can get over this summer, ha ha ha. I'd like to dedicate this one to the draggin' scene that's goin' on. All the soldiers that are fightin' in Chicago, Milwaukee and New York... Oh yes, and all the soldiers fightin' in Vietnam. I'd like to do a thing called "Machine Gun"

[Hook 1: Hendrix]
Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart
Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart

[Verse 1: Hendrix]
Evil man make me kill ya
Evil man make you kill me
Evil man make me kill you
Even though we're only families apart
Well I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer
(You know what I mean)
Hey and your bullets keep knocking me down
Hey I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer now
Yeah but you still blast me down to the ground
The same way you shoot me down baby
You'll be going just the same
Three times the pain
And your own self to blame
Hey machine gun
I ain't afraid of your mess no more, babe
I ain't afraid no more
After a while your cheap talk don't even cause me pain
So let your bullets fly like rain
Cause I know all the time you're wrong baby
And you'll be goin' just the same

[Hook 2: Jimi Hendrix]
Yeah machine gun
Tearing my family apart
Yeah yeah alright
Tearing my family apart

[Verse 2: Buddy Miles]
Don't you shoot him down
He's about to leave here
Don't you shoot him down
He's got to stay here
He ain't going nowhere
He's been shot down to the ground
Where he can't survive, no no

[Outro: Hendrix & Miles]
Yeah that's what we don't wanna hear any more, alright

[Verse 1: Shawn & Nate]
In this world today
Love is scarce and far away
And your heart gets so afraid to trust someone
All the times he let you down
There was no love to be found
Well it's not the end
There'll be time to mend
And you'll love again

[Chorus]
Never, Never let a broken heart
Take a chance for love away
Don't never let it make you fall apart
Never, Never ever let the pain
Take your need for love away
Never, no never

[Verse 2: Wanya]
And I know it seems hard
Open up let down your guards
But you owe it to your heart
To try again
Oh comes the time
When we must change
What the past has thrown away
Don't take the blame
Don't be ashamed
Throw your fears away

[Chorus]
Never, Never let a broken heart
Take a chance for love away
Don't never let it make you fall apart
Never, Never ever let the pain
Take your need for love away
Never, no never

[Bridge: Nate & Wanya]
I know don't be afraid
Or you will never find
Another one you love again
I know that you'll be sorry girl
Be strong before it's too late
Because forever is too long
For you to live in pain
Just don't give up
Please open up to love
To love, to love

[Chorus]
Never, Never let a broken heart
Take a chance for love away
Don't never let it make you fall apart
Never, Never ever let the pain
Take your need for love away
Never, no never

[Outro]
Never, Never let a broken heart
Take a chance for love away
Don't never let it make you fall apart
Never, Never ever let the pain
Take your need for love away
Never, no never

[Wanya adlibs]
So don't be afraid
You'll love again
No you don't have to live in pain
Its never too late
You'll find a way to love
Girl don't be afraid
You'll love again
Girl you don't have to live in pain
When there's a way
You'll find a way
It's never too late
You'll find a way to love
You'll always be the one I love, every hour, every day, every year
You'll always be the one I love, thru each smile, thru each sigh, thru each tear
My heart will feel the same old way, even though the stars fade from above
I promise there will be no other arms for me, you'll always be the one I love
Yes your letter reached me early this morning baby
And I read every word you had to say
I said your letter reached me early this morning baby
And I read every word you had to say
But you know I just don't understand you waman
If you love me why in the world did you go away

Your letter said that you're doing ok
But then it read: "Please, let me come back home."
Your letter said that you're doing ok
But then it read: "Please, let me come back home."

[Verse 1]
You make a fool out of yourself
When you see me by myself
You act as though there's something else
That you're thinking of
But I know what you're thinking, love

[Verse 2]
And I'm surprised when you're surprised
You're talking to some other guys
But I know when I'm in your thighs
Oh that I'll be the only man
And you won't be so lonely then

[Chorus]
Well I've been rain drippin' lately
Nobody's gonna save me
But utopia's never gave me much help
And I'm trippin' out

And I don't know who told me to be
Inside my lungs I can breathe
Inside I'm stung just like a bee
And I'm trippin' out

[Verse 3]
With a bullet I can say
If you got 'em let 'em spray
Cover your heart in case you catch a stray
Oh and it'll be just like you bled
With a hole up in your head
Uh huh uh uh
Ooh ooh ooh

[Chorus]
Well I've been rain drippin' lately
Nobody's gonna save me
But utopia's never gave me much help
And I'm trippin' out

And I don't know who told me to be
Inside my lungs I can breathe
Inside I'm stung just like a bee
And I'm trippin' out
I know you think I'm like the other man
You let him in and then he breaks your heart again
But this thing is more than physical
I free your mind and I bless your soul

Tonight we're gonna lose track of time
Body and spirit will intertwine
And we'll stay here the rest of the night

Baby when the sun comes up
I'm gonna be holding you
Its destiny that you're next to me
I'm in love with you
Oh baby, when I wake up
I'm gonna be next to you
A new day rise
I wanna look in your eyes, I'm in love with you

Wait a minute baby, I'm not through
I intend to spend more than one night with you
A love affair that never ends
Like the old song says "lets do it again"
Come with me
I know you'll stay
You'll wake up in the morning to a brand new day
That begins the rest of your life

And baby
Baby when the sun comes up
I'm gonna be holding you
Its destiny that you're next to me
I'm in love with you
Oh baby, when I wake up
I'm gonna be next to you
A new day rise
I wanna look in your eyes

And when morning breaks
Ill awaken and I won't want you to go
When your gone ill hold on to the memory all day

Baby when the sun comes up
Yeah, yeah yeah

So listen here now
I know you've been hurt by the wonderful
And I know your pain
And I know you never thought you could love again
But I know the way
Yeah yeah yeah
I know about your circumstance, but love is here with a second chance
So ah take my hand and follow me
You'll never want to leave
You'll still be here, oh yeah when the sun comes up
You'll still be here oh yeah when the sun comes up
You'll still be here in the morning when the sun comes up

Ohooo when the sun comes up

[Verse 1]
You're the one that makes my day a dream come true
Yet and still you wonder if I think of you
You ought to see how the other girls behave when you're not around
And only then you would know that it's on your finger I'm wound

[Chorus]
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
That I care

[Verse 2]
There's no need for you not to have faith in me
'Cause it's by your side girl that I long to be
Yes, there are times with my friends when I don't have much to say
What you don't know is with you I could never act that way, no no

[Chorus]
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
That I care

[Bridge]
I care for you, baby
I swear I care for you

[Verse 3]
No no, there's no need for you not to have faith in me
'Cause it's by your side, girl, that I long to be
Yes, there are times with my friends when I don't have much to say, no no
What you don't know is with you I could never act that way

[Chorus]
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
That I care

[Outro]
I care for you, baby
I swear I care for you
I care for you, baby
You know I care for you
I care for you, baby, ooh
Care for you, baby
I swear I care for you
Care for you, baby
The most beautiful of dreams serves nothing as long as
It is not deep feeling firsthand experience of the individual

It's not just fixed in the head, left for it to penetrate
And find its way through to the heart
We might need to move it to go beyond it

Inexpressible, find your way to the heart

It's not just fixed in the head, left for it to penetrate
And find its way through to the heart
We might need to move it to go beyond it

Inexpressible, find your way to the heart
You don't remind me
Of the iris in spring
Or of dawn on the mountain
When the bluebird starts to sing

You don't remind me
Of the breeze on the bay
Or a star in the fountain
Where the silverfishes play

To the moon glow in September
You reveal no resemblance
Of the first snow in November
You're not even a semblance

No, you don't remind me
Of the world around me
For behind me for so much such
My love for you blinds me
That my darling you only remind me
Of you
Of you
Of you
(Norma Sallitt)

Well the rain's fallin' down around you
So you cry yourself to sleep
I know love hurts when one doesn't love as deep
You're feelin' lost and empty
'Cause you gave yourself away
But don't be ashamed to cry
It's okay
But you've got to Hang On In
Baby, be strong
Love will always find a way
No, you can't give up
You've just got to go on
Tomorrow's gonna be a brighter day
Hang on
You keep searchin' for the reasons
As you walk the lonely halls
You wait by a telephone
But he never calls
Time's the only healer
For the broken hearts (….)
Love is like a wind (…)
But you've got to Hang On In
Baby, be strong
Love will always find a way
No, you can't give up
You've just got to go on
Tomorrow's gonna be a brighter day
Hang on
I know what you're goin' through
Every time you see his face
And I don't know where or when
But I know that you'll love again
Hang On In
Baby, be strong
Love will always find a way
No, you can't give up
You've just got to go on
Tomorrow's gonna be a brighter day
Hang on
Catana, what goddess gave you the name
That has this heart of mine so aflame?
Tell me, Catana, what heaven gave you your eyes?
What elfin fiddler plays for your sighs?

Fashioned of Venus, that is your form and your face
Two clinging vines for arms, hold me in tender embrace
While the mood poses from lips made of roses
Each word opposes all else but love
Catana, like a Madonna, you I'll adore forevermore

While the mood poses from lips made of roses
Each word opposes all else but love
Catana, like a Madonna, you I'll adore forevermore

Chorus:
Get it while it's hot

I've been all over Europe
And across the sea
With each new place
It gets clearer to me
Week after week
On tour with my band
You don't have to speak
'Cause they all understand

The power of the blues
Hey, hey, the power of the blues
And that's good news
I'm talking about the power of the blues

Yes, it's just a few changes
That I won't deny
But if you think it's easy
You just give it a try
You know the truth
But you're afraid to say it
That it ain't what I play
It's the way that I play it
That's the power of the blues
Yes, the power of the blues
You'll change your views
When you hear the power of the blues

Now me and Lucille
We're gonna stop this war
I'm no politician
But I know the score
You can call me a hawk
Or maybe I'm a dove
But all we gotta do
Is shoot 'em full of love

With the power of the blues
Hey, the power of the blues
It's the thing to use
Talking about the power of the blues
Yes, I am
Dum dum dum dum dum-dum
Do...
Do... Oooh...

You're still captivating even though it's been so long
You used to love me, tell me baby what went wrong
'Cause now you march to the beat of a different song

Try to understand that we needed space
But everywhere I turn I see your face
I've been waiting for you to come home
'Cause I don't want to be alone
I still love you

Why did you take away your love
When did you think to just give up
How am I supposed to carry on now
Without you
You are my light

I have changed girl since I last saw you
When you left, you don't know what you put me through
But my heart's still racing just being next to you
I can't escape the magic in your eyes
Is there a way to make you realize
There's no one more special to my heart
But you want us to be apart
I still love you

Why did you take away your love, baby
When did you think to just give up, yea
How am I supposed to carry on now
Without you

You were my world
You meant everything to me
You're the air I breathe
The song I sing
You were my queen, I was your king
But if we can try to work it
We'll show the world what love is about
Baby come home cause I can't take no more
Of this loneliness
And emptiness

Why did you take away your love
(Take away your love)
When did you think to just give up
(Oh...)
How am I supposed to carry on now
Without you
Why did you take away your love
When did you think to just give up
How am I supposed to carry on
Without you
You are my
You are my light
It's your thing (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you
Who to sock it to

It's your thing (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you
Who to sock it to

And if you want me to love you, maybe I will
I need you woman, it ain't no big deal
You need lovin' just as bad as I do, now
Make's me no difference now, who you give your thing to

It's your thing (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you
Who to sock it to

It's your thing, girl (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
Don't let me tell ya
Who to sock it to
So, it's your thing (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you
Who to sock it to
Hit me band

So, it's your thing girl (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
No doubt about it
Who I'm gonna sock it to
I'm not much to look at, nothin' to see
Just glad I'm livin' and happy to be
I got a woman, crazy for me
She's funny that way

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She'd never holler, she'd live in a tent
I got a woman, crazy for me
She's funny that way

Though she'd love to work and slave for me every day
She'd be so much better off if I went away

But why should I leave her, why should I go?
She'd be unhappy without me, I know
I got a woman, crazy for me
She's funny that way

When I hurt her feelin's once in a while
Her only answer is one little smile
I got a woman, crazy for me
She's funny that way
Ooh you're a holiday, ev'ry day, such a holiday
Now it's my turn to say, and I say you're a holiday

It's something I think's worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
Throwing stones, throwing stones

Ooh it's a funny game
Don't believe that it's all the same
Can't think what I've just said
Put the soft pillow on my head

If millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When that someone else is me
It's unkind, it's unkind

De de de de de    de de de de de de de
De de de de de de de de de de de
I walk the lonely streets
I watch the people passing by
I used to smile and say hello
I guess that I was just a happy guy
Then you happened, girl
This feeling that possesses me
I just can't move myself
I guess it all just had to be

I can't see nobody...no
No, I can't see nobody...oh no
My eyes can only look at you...
Baby...

I can't see nobody...oh no
No, I can't see nobody...oh no
My eyes can only look at you...

I started a joke, which started the whole world crying
But I didn't see that the joke was on me, oh no
I started to cry, which started the whole world laughing
Oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was on me

I looked at the skies, running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed, hurting my head from things that I'd said
Til I finally died, which started the whole world living
Oh, if I'd only seen, oh no, that the joke was on me...oh no
That the joke was on me
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh no
Feel I'm goin' back to Massachusetts
Something's telling me I must go home
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
The day I left her standing on her own

Talk about the life in Massachusetts
Speak about the people I have seen
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen
I will remember Massachusetts...oh yeah
I will remember Massachusetts...oh yeah
Oh

[Intro: Rihanna]
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Boy, your standin' real close to me
Tell me now, what's it gonna be?
You like what you see but lovin' don't come easily
Now your whisperin' in my ear, all the things that I wanna hear
Let me make it very clear, words are not enough for me
Did you think that you could smile and steal my heart away?
Can't deny I like your style, but it just don't work that way

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Ooh, I'm kinda feelin' you right now
You keep me standin' tight now
It's gettin hard to fight now
Still, I wonder, wonder should I?
Ooh, you know they're playin' my song now
You know you're turnin' me on now
The feelings gettin' strong now
Still, I wonder, wonder should I?

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Back and forth, baby, round and round
So high that I can't come down
It's too late to turn back now
Still, I'm scared to lose control
Feel the heat burning like the sun
Feel the beat as we move as one
Don't stop til' the night is done
Hold me close, boy, don't let go
Still, I got to know if this is real or just a dream
Because in the mornin', my true love is what I wanna see

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Ooh, I'm kinda feelin' you right now (Feelin' you baby)
You keep me standin' tight now
It's gettin' hard to fight now
Still, I wonder, wonder should I? (Still, I wonder, wonder should I?)
Ooh, you know they're playin' my song now
You know you're turnin' me on now (Ooh, baby)
The feelings gettin' strong now
Still, I wonder, wonder should I? Yeah

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Did you think you could smile and steal my heart away?
Can't deny I like your style, but it just don't work that way

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Ooh, I'm kinda feelin' you right now (Feelin' you right now)
You keep me standin' tight now
It's gettin' hard to fight now
Still, I wonder, wonder should I? (Still, I wonder, wonder should I?)

Still, I wonder, wonder should I?
Ooh, I'm kinda feelin' you right now (Can't control what I'm feeling baby)
You keep me standin' tight now

Outro
Standing in the rain
Teardrops begin to fall
I could feel your pain
Raindrops just hide it all

He said I didn't need you, made you cry
You turned and walked away
I was there again with my arms open wide
Didn't you hear me say?

(Come to me)
I'll show you better ways
(Come to me)
I love you, girl

(Come to me)
Oh, babe

Wanting you to hold
I chased your love through the storm
Out of self control
The thought was enough to keep me warm
Girl, I really need you

So don't ignore your heart when I say

(Come to me)
I'll show you better ways

It's so damn crowded, we should leave
(What's it gonna be boy?)
Tell me what's it gonna be

[Verse 2]
Can we take it there?
Club is about to close
Gimme one more dance and I'm ready to go
And the DJ's playin' all the same songs
And the night is about to end
Can we meet in the parkin' lot?
Find a quiet place where we can talk
To find out more about each other
Baby can we?

[Refrain 2]
(Oh) I wanna get closer
(Oh) Baby let me show ya
(Oh) Now that you came over, made your move
Now tell me what you wanna do
(Ohhh) Tell me what I wanna hear
(Ohhh) Whisper something in my ear
(Ohhh) Your makin' me feel so sexy
Baby we should get up outta here

[Chorus 2]
(What's it gonna be boy?)
I'm watchin' you, you watchin' me
(What's it gonna be boy?)
Can't you feel this chemistry?
(What's it gonna be boy?)
This place is crowded we should leave
(What's it gonna be boy?)
Tell me what's it gonna be

[Bridge]
You know I'm feeling you tonight (I'm feeling you)
So let's find another spot to go (You feeling me)
So we can get to know each other better
I'll go and tell my girls (I'll tell my girls)
And you go and tell your boys (Go tell your boys)
That we gonna be leavin'
Tell me what's it gonna be

You know I'm feeling you tonight (I'm feeling you)
So let's find another spot to go (You feeling me)
And baby we can leave here together (Baby can we leave?)
I'll go and tell my girls
If you go and tell your boys
That we gonna be leavin'
Tell me what's it gonna be

[Chorus 3]
(What's it gonna be boy?)
I'm watchin' you, you watchin' me
(What's it gonna be boy?)
Can't you feel this chemistry?
(What's it gonna be boy?)
It's so damn crowded, we should leave
(What's it gonna be boy?)
Tell me what's it gonna be

[Outro]
(What's it gonna be boy)
I'm watchin' you, you watchin' me
What's it gonna be boy?
What's it gonna be boy?
What's it gonna be boy?
(Tell me what's it gonna be)
What's it gonna be boy?
What's it gonna be boy?
They say that falling in love is wonderful
It's wonderful, so they say

And, with a moon up above, it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me

I can't recall who said it
I know I never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand
And

The thing that's known as romance is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

To leave your house some morning
And, without any warning
You're stopping people, shouting that love is grand
And

To hold a girl in your arms is wonderful, wonderful
In every way
So they say
With 

[Nancy Sinatra], and (chorus)

[Getting stoned on sunshine, getting high on air,]
Getting to it naturally, really getting there

[Getting such a high on, loving what I do,]
I'm so full of happiness, my hope's on something new

[Each day on earth is a day that's worth remembering] (remembering, remembering)

(ding-a-ling)

[My pot is filled with flowers, my grass is bright and green,]
My tears brewing in my cup, and still I make the scene

[But just don't try to change me, I love the world I found,]
I've got to fly my own sweet way, and don't you shoot me down. 

[hahaha]

(remembering, remembering)

(a ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling)
Don't pity me, I'm glad to be a ding-a-ling, 

[a ding-a-ling], (ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling)
( ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling)
Ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling, (ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling)
Ha ha ha, that's silly.(ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling)
Can you see me, are you near me?
Can you hear me crying out for life?
Can you tell me, where's the glory?
Ride the days and sail the nights
When it's over you'll find the answer
Running in the whispering rain
Anno mundi? can you wonder!
Truth or thunder, life or blame

Do you see a vision of a perfect place?
Does it make you laugh, put a smile on your face?
Do you need a mirror, do you see it well?
Does the hand of god still toll the bell?
There are people laughing
They're all laughing at you
If only they could see what you're saying is true
Still generals fighting, making war on the worlds
Don't they know, Don't they know?
No,no, no

CHORUS:
The winds in the night blows cold
Your eyes are burning
As the sands of our time grow old
Anno Mundi
Do you follow the path that so many tread?
Are you among the blind so easily lead?
Do you join the war, do you fight for the cause?
Depends on another to fight it alone

CHORUS

Can you see me now, can you hear me now?
Can you tell me where's the glory?
Ride the days and sail the nights
When it's over, you'll find the answer
Runnin' in the rain

There's a hope that's growing and a vision too
All those angry hearts reach out for you
Do you look to the dawn, see a new day begun?
No longer the fool, the vision is done
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do birds sing so gay
And lovers await the break of day
Why do they fall in love
Why does the rain fall from up above
Why do fools fall in love
Why do they fall in love
Love is a losing game
Love can be a shame
I know of a fool you see
For that fool is me
Tell me why
Tell my why

Why do birds sing so gay
And lovers await the break of day
Why do they fall in love
Why does the rain fall from up above
Why do fools fall in love
Why do they fall in love
Why does my heart skip this crazy beat
For I know
It will reach defeat
Tell me why
Tell me why
Why do fools fall in love?
He'd sing his song most every night
Wishing she was there behind the light
The people danced and sang along
On the cardboard stage he never sang it wrong

And the piper played the tune
And the drummer won his spurs
But the song that the singer sang was for her

Now the singer's song is never heard
And the visions he once saw are disappeared
Now they never dance or sing along
But on the cardboard stage he never sang it wrong

And the piper played the tune
And the drummer won his spurs
But the song that the singer sang was for her

Ahaha...

[Verse 1]
After school, walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails
And I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
Trying to recreate images life gives us from our past
And sometimes it's a sad song

[Chorus]
But I, cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama, I've been crying
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun

[Verse 2]
Now, moving on, down my street
I see people I won't ever meet
Think of her, take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps
And sometimes it's a sad song

[Chorus]
But I, cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama, I've been crying
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun

[Verse 3]
The rhythm of her conversation
The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt when she first saw me
Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player
Back and forth and here and gone
And on and on and on and on

[Chorus]
I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama, I've been crying
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun
Yeah, oh oh, yeah
I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama, I've been crying
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun
Yeah, oh oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Well, my friend Bob's in jail today
His girlfriend is too
For stealing change for gasoline
Nothing to do but rue
Destroy the proof
'Cause there will never be another one just like you, no
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

[Verse 2]
I met him on the boulevard
Hollywood and Vine
He said, "You're gonna be a superstar"
I said, "That's fine, sublime"
He loved my crime
But there will never be another one just like you, no
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

[Chorus]
I never see you
I never see you
I never see you

[Verse 3]
Hanging late all through the night
Blackest flag at dawn
A lust for life that kills itself
Before it gets too strong, that's wrong
Please be lifelong
'Cause there will never be another one just like you, no
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

[Chorus]
I never see you
I never see you
I never see you

[Bridge]
Killing yourself, I hear your voice on the phone
The sound is so far away
Remember the home and how they left us alone
Remember our friend, oh
Stealing everything in the store
You know I want you to stay
Remember the home and how they left us alone
Friends fade away…

[Verse 4]
Well, my friend Bob's insane today
I know I am too
The mental patients laugh and cry
Nothing to do but rue
Destroy the proof
'Cause there will never be another one just like you, no
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob...

[Chorus: Georgi Kay]
In my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for
And in my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for

[Post-Chorus: Flo Rida]
I've waited for this life
Waited for this time
Waited for this moment to step into the light
Got this drink up in my cup
One night to live it up
You know I'm not stopping till we've had enough

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Perfect brother, can't tell you that I'm at but I'm on the right track?
Every time I look back, it's a struggle
No faith I woulda' sat right there, forgot about my friends
'Cause I donE hustled, no, not dope, just soap in vanilla envelopes
Check out my demo, oh, I'm flo' right now, when I go right now
Was it ever that simple? Used to roll, get pumped like a Pitbull
Out the way, said, "I ain't got potential, cake walk guess I ain't get the memo"
Ooh, take a walk in my shoes, 'cause tonight, my dreams, they came true
And I'ma party it up through the roof
(This is what we're waiting for)

[Chorus: Georgi Kay]
In my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for
And in my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for

[Post-Chorus: Flo Rida]
I've waited for this life
Waited for this time
Waited for this moment to step into the light
Got this drink up in my cup, one night to live it up
You know I'm not stopping 'til we've had enough

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Party people
I've got the wind at my head, my mind says yes when my body says when I equal
No, it's not an option, I'ma yes I can 'til this spaceship land with the Beatles
See the road blocks up and my autograph sucks, but the leech is unbelievable
Got the round, but the bucks not wanna get bucked
But, my fist up, rock star sign
Guitars just broke, in my mind
Was packing up, I might get by
Talking bout luck, on my side oh
Take a walk in my shoes
'Cause in like my dreams they came true
And I'm a party it up through the roof, ooh
(This is what we're waiting for)

[Chorus: Georgi Kay]
And in my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for
And in my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for
And in my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for

[Verse 1]
I just found joy
I'm as happy as a baby boy
With another brand new choo-choo toy
When I'm with my sweet Lorraine

A pair of eyes
That are bluer than the summer sky
When you see them, you'll realize
Why I love my sweet Lorraine

[Bridge]
When it's rainin', I don't miss the sun
For it's in my sweetie's smile
Just to think that I'm the lucky one
Who will lead her down the aisle

[Verse 2]
Each night I pray
That nobody steals her heart away
Just can't wait until that happy day
When I marry sweet Lorraine

[Bridge]
Now when it's rainin', I don't miss the sun
For it's in my sweetie's smile
Just to think that I'm the lucky one
Who will lead her down the aisle, whoa ho ho

[Outro]
Hey, each night I pray
That nobody steals her heart away
Just can't wait until that happy day
When I marry sweet, sweet Lorraine
Yes, I've packed up my clothes
I'm moving away from your door
Lord, I've packed up my clothes
Said, I'm moving away from your door
I've been your fool for so long
Babe, I won't play that fool no more

I gave you all my money
I work as hard as I can
I came home early one morning
I found you with another man
Babe, I've packed up my clothes
I'm moving away from your door
Said, I've been your fool for so long
And Lord, I won't play that fool no more

Solo

So good-bye baby
You don't even care
Yes, I had a love so strong for you
But you treat me so unfair
Said, I've packed up my clothes
I'm moving away from your door
You know, I've been your fool for so long
And babe, I won't play that fool no more
I wander lonely as a cloud
I keep my head above the crowd
Ain't nobody else as big as me
But I must remember friends
What has to start just has to end
Everybody's got a destiny

And I know when the swallows flies
Yes I know, and the earth just dies
Then I'll be told what I am
The swallow and me

I'll look after number one
I'll forget the beggar's son
Everybody's got to stay alive
I'll keep a-walking amongst the clouds
I'll keep my head above the crowd
I'll watch them live, I'll watch them die

And I know when the swallows flies
Yes I know, and the earth just dies
Then I'll be told what I am
The swallow and me
And I know when the swallows flies
Yes I know, and the earth just dies
Yes I know when the swallow flies
Yes I know, and the earth just dies

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris]
I've been looking for someone to be there when the water rise
Not just when the skies are clear
But when the tears form in my eyes
Sometimes it's rough but strange enough
You stay through all the pain
I owe you somewhere of that
Can you be my umbrella in the rain?

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Nathan Morris]
(Will you be there?) When the storm clouds roll in
(Will you be there?) When the nights get cold and
(Will you be there?) To be the one I'm holding
I need you, where are ya?
(Will you be there?) When the winds are blowing
(Will you be there?) You feel the changes coming
(Will you be there?) Just tell me so
All I wanna know is can you stand the rain?

[Verse 2: Shawn Stockman]
Life can be so suffocating
It makes it hard to breathe
And love is overrated for the ones who don't believe
But I know somewhere out there
What I want will surely find me
Like the eye of a hurricane
Will you be the peace that I need?
I know that when I find you I ain't going nowhere
When the weather is raging hope you'll be there
With you in my life, won't be ashamed, so
Can you be my umbrella in the rain?

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Shawn Stockman]
(Will you be there?) When the storm clouds roll in
(Will you be there?) When the nights get cold and
(Will you be there?) To be the one I'm holding
I need you, where are ya?
(Will you be there?) When the winds are blowing
(Will you be there?) You feel the changes coming
(Will you be there?) Just tell me so
All I wanna know is can you stand the rain?

[Bridge: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
When the sunrise kisses the sky
And the clouds clear
Girl, I know you're gonna be here
With me through adversity
If this feeling stays the same
Only then I know that you can stand the rain

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
(Will you be there?) When the storm clouds roll in
(Will you be there?) When the nights get cold and
(Will you be there?) To be the one I'm holding
I need you, where are ya?
(Will you be there?) When the winds are blowing
(Will you be there?) You feel the changes coming
(Will you be there?) Just tell me so
All I wanna know is can you stand the rain?

[Outro: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
(Will you be there?) When the walls fall crashing
(Will you be there?) Could your love everlast it?
(Will you be there?) I've been looking for someone
Is it you? Is it you, girl?
(Will you be there?) Is it you? Hope it's you, girl
(Will you be there?) Is it you? is it you, girl?
(Will you be there?) Is it you? Hope it's you, girl
All I wanna know is can you stand the rain

[Intro]
Do you feel this?
I know you feel this
Are you ready?
I don’t think so

[Verse 1]
Somebody give me my truck
So I can ride on the clouds
So I can turn up the bass like
Somebody pass my guitar
So I can look like a star
And spend this cash like

[Pre-Chorus]
What you gonna do when the crowd goes 'ayo'?
Why you standing on the wall?
Music starting everywhere
So why don’t you just move along?

[Chorus]
I see you lookin' at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don’t you do somethin'?
I see you lookin' at me
Like I got what you need
Get up out of your seat
Why don’t you do somethin'?

[Verse 2]
Now you all in my grill
'Cause I say what I feel
Only rock to what's real
Baby, bump, bump
But I can't do that with you
Only here with my crew
You can roll if you can
Don’t be a punk, punk

[Pre-Chorus]
What you gonna do when the crowd goes 'ayo'?
Why you standing on the wall?
Music starting everywhere
So why don’t you just move along?

[Chorus]
I see you lookin' at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don’t you do somethin'?
I see you lookin' at me

I see you lookin' at me
Like I got what you need
Get up out of your seat
Why don’t you do somethin'?
I see you lookin' at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don’t you do somethin'?

[Bridge]
I see you lookin' over here
Can’t you tell I'm havin' fun?
If you know like I know
You would stop starin' at us
And get your own space
And do somethin'

[Chorus]
I see you lookin' at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don’t you do somethin'?
I see you lookin' at me
Like I got what you need
Get up out of your seat

Fuck

Why don’t you do somethin'?
I see you lookin' at me
Like I got what you need
Get up out of your seat

[Outro]
What you gonna do when the crowd goes 'ayo'?
Why you standing on the wall?
Music starting everywhere
So why don’t you just move along?

You can take my word for it, baby
There's nobody else but you
Nobody else will do

You can feel it in my kiss
You can see it in my eyes
I'm tellin' you what my heart's tellin' me
And my heart never lies

So you can take my word for it, baby

So won'tcha take my word for it, baby?
Nobody else but you

Nobody else could be

So won'tcha take my word for it, baby?
There's nobody else but you

Nobody else but you
Version on Seasons Greetings:
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Can help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

They know that Santa's on his way
With toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you

Merry Christmas

(Some other version of the song):
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows some turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys
And goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said
Many times, many ways
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas to.. You!
Did you ever hear the story of the Christmas tree?
Who just didn't want to change the show
He liked living in the woods and playing with squirrels
He liked bicycles and snow
He liked wolves and eagles and grizzly bears
And critters and creatures that crawled
Why bugs were some of his very best friends
Spiders and ants and all
Now that's not to say that he ever looked down
On a vision of twinkled lights
Or on mirrored bubbles and peppermint canes
And a thousand other delights
And he often had dreams of tiny reindeer
And a jolly old man in a sleigh
Full of toys and presents and wonderful things
And a story of Christmas day
Oh, Alfie believed in Christmas alright
He was full of Christmas cheer
All of each and every day
And all throughout the year
To Him it was more than a special time
Much more than a special day
It was more than a beautiful story
It was a special kind of way
You see some folks have never heard a jingle bell ring
And they've never heard of Santa Claus
They've never heard the story of the Son Of God
And that made Alfie pause
Did that mean that they'd never know of peace on earth
Or the brotherhood of man
Or know how to love, or know how to give
If they can't, no one can
You see, life is a very special kind of thing
Not just for a chosen few
But for each and every living, breathing thing
Not just me and you
So when you're at Christmas prayers this year
Alfie asked me if I'd ask you
Say a prayer for the wind and the water and the wood
And those who live there too
This is new
This is the new
The new me
The new them
The new us

This is
The path
Greater love walks?
Slowly
Persist
Persistent
A persistent
Onward momentum

I care less
I only honor this
Now, now nothing else
Nothing happens
I loosen
My body
For this
Persistent
Ooh ah
It gets cold outside standing all alone
Spendin' all day on the telephone
All I wanna do is go home
But I won't stop here
Checkpoints got us paranoid
They think they've got another boy
Well I got somethin' you need to know about it, and I can't stop now
I gotta green light I'm on my way
Just turnin' to a brighter day
Everything ain't goin' my way
But I won't stop now

Well I won't breakdown
Well I won't breakdown
Well I won't breakdown
Well I won't breakdown

Once again we do a show and
Leave with a pocket of zero dollar bills
And we feel it's a steal
But we won't breakdown
Backseat of the van
Thinkin' damn I'm the man
With the master plan
And I can't give a damn about nothin' at all
I'm gonna do my thing
And not stop now
So I keep on bringin' it all
Till I reach the light I
I won't stop now, I can see the light
I'm already feelin' late at the light
So I can't breakdown
Well I won't breakdown, breakdown
Well I won't breakdown, breakdown
Well I won't breakdown, breakdown
Well I won't breakdown, breakdown

Well I can see it, feel it, I know (breakdown)
Breakdown
Well I won't breakdown
Well I won't breakdown
Well I won't breakdown
Well I can't breakdown
Well I won't breakdown
Well I won't breakdown
Well I won't breakdown
Well I won't breakdown, breakdown
In whatever society
The continuity
Will seem to be
Just a few men
Keen to rule;
Overwhelming
The majority
Will assent and
Allow them to do so
(Johnny Van Zant -- Robert White Johnson -- Donnie Van Zant -- Pat Buchanan)

Every time I think I got it all figured out
Then I draw a blank and my whole world crashes down
So many people have got it worse than me
But that could change tomorrow, ain't no guarantee

(chorus)
How soon we forget
To count every blessing
If you think you got it bad take a look around
How soon we forget
That life is one big lesson
Still we make the same mistakes time and time again
How soon we forget

Got a freind of mine who says he's run all out of luck
But he'll be fine, 'cause he just ain't drunk enough
The world is empty when you're slammin' those shots down
How can you be happy, son when the devil's hangin' 'round
How soon we forget
To count every blessing
If you think you got it bad take a look around
How soon we forget
That life is one big lesson
Still we make the same mistakes time and time again
How soon we forget
How soon we forget

Just remember, thank God you're here today
If you got the will you can find a way

How soon we forget... oh, baby

How soon we forget
To count every blessing
If you think you got it bad take a look around
How soon we forget
That life is one big lesson
Still we make the same mistakes time and time again
There's a message to this madness here my freind
Will we ever learn before the story ends

Soon we all forget
How soon we forget
Soon we forget.. ooh
Take a look around and you will see
Soon we all forget... oh
So many people have got it worse than me
Oh.. can't you see
How soon we all forget
Baby, baby don't treat me so bad
I'm the best boy that you ever had
You wanna leave now and find a new start
Please you're mean now please stop
It's gonna kill me if you break my heart

Don't you let me down again
You're just bound to see the end

Baby, baby don't treat me this way
I'm gonna make it again someday
There's just one thing I'd like you to know
I got no more to lose if you go

Don't you let me down again
You're just bound to see the end
Let someone start believing in you
Let him hold out his hand
Let him touch you and watch what happens

One someone who can look in your eyes
And see into your heart
Let him find you and watch what happens

Cold, no I won't believe your heart is cold
Maybe just afraid to be broken again

Let someone with a deep love to give
Give that deep love to you
And what magic you'll see

Let someone with a deep love to give
Give that deep love to you
And what magic you'll see

Let someone give his heart
Someone who cares like me
Let someone give his heart who cares like me
Someone who cares like me
You're gonna love what happens
Tell her you love her each day
You'll make her happy that way
A simple "I love you" means more than money
And with a kiss or two her life is sunny

Give her a reason to live
She needs the love that you give
Always remember that is what she lives for

She hopes you love her ...
Tell her you love her!
Tell her you love her --
Today!

Give her a reason to live
She needs the love that you give

Always remember that is what she lives for

She hopes you love her ...
Tell her you love her!
Tell her you love her --
Today!

[Verse 1]
Someday I'll find her
And I'm still reminded
Maybe she's best in dreams
She's still the best I've seen

[Hook]
Dreamin'
Dreamin'
Dreamin'
Baby, I'm dreamin'

[Verse 2]
Out on her windowsill
Baby remember
Maybe I'm out of luck
Maybe it's running still

[Hook]
Dreamin'
Dreamin'
Dreamin'
Baby, I'm dreamin'
For every man there's a woman
For every life there's a plan
And wise men know it was ever so
Since the world began, woman was made for man
Where is she, where is the woman for me?

For every prince there's a princess
For every Joe there's a Joan
And if you wait, you will find the mate
Born for you alone, happy to be your own
Where is she, where is the woman for me?

Find the one, find the one
Then together you will find the sun

For every heart there's a moment
For every hand, a glove
And for every woman, a man to love

For every heart there's a moment
For every hand, a glove
And for every woman, a man to love
Where is she, where is the one for me?
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
That's when my love comes tumbling down
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
When there' no one else around

I'm gonna take you girl and hold you
Do all things I told you in the midnight hour
I'm gonna wait till the stars come out
See them twinkle in your eyes

'M gonna wait till the midnight hour
That's when my love begins to shine
You're the only girl I know
Really love you so in the midnight hour

[Verse 1]
I wonder, wonder wonder
Why your eyes they wander?
I wonder, wonder wonder
About the spell that you are under
Tell me its some hocus pocus
Made to lose your focus
I wonder why the cold kiss and you think I wouldn't notice

[Hook]
You don't love me like you say you do
You don't want me the way that I want you
You don't love me like you say you do (you do) you do

[Chorus]
Can I get me some satisfaction
Can I get me some satisfaction
Can I get me some satisfaction
That's all I'm asking you, you, of you
Give me the magic back, that's all I ask of you
Can I get me some satisfaction
Can I get me some satisfaction
Can I get me some satisfaction
That's all I'm asking you, you, of you
Give me the magic back, that's all I ask of you

[Verse 2]
I wonder if it's over, middle of October
I don't know why in autumn, she keeps giving the cold shoulder
She knows how much I love her don't know what I could have told her
I wonder why she makes me think I didn't even know her

[Hook]
You don't love me like you say you do
You don't want me the way that I want you
You don't love me like you say you do (you do) you do

[Bridge]
Why don't you give me (give me give me give me give me your love)
Give me your love (give me give me give me your love)
Is that too much to ask you can I
Get some satisfaction from you

[Hook]
You don't love me like you say you do
You don't want me the way that I want you
You don't love me like you say you do (you do) you do

[Chorus]
Can I get me some satisfaction
Can I get me some satisfaction
Can I get me some satisfaction
That's all I'm asking you, you, of you
Give me the magic back, that's all I ask of you
Can I get me some satisfaction
Can I get me some satisfaction
Can I get me some satisfaction
That's all I'm asking you, you, of you
Give me the magic back, that's all I ask of you

[Verse 1]
I picked the morning paper off the floor
It was full of other people's little wars
Wouldn't they like their peace, don't we get bored?

[Chorus]
And we call for the three great stimulants
Of the exhausted ones
Artifice, brutality and innocence
Artifice and innocence

[Verse 2]
No tanks have ever rumbled through these streets
And the drone of planes at night has never frightened me
I keep the hours and the company that I please

[Chorus]
And we call for the three great stimulants
Of the exhausted ones
Artifice, brutality and innocence
Artifice and innocence

[Bridge]
Oh and deep in the night our appetites find us
Release us and blind us deep in the night
While madmen sit up building bombs and making laws and bars
They'd like to slam free choice behind us

[Verse 3]
I saw a little lawyer on the tube
He said, "it's so easy now, anyone can sue"
"Let me show you how your petty aggravations can profit you"

[Chorus]
Call for the three great stimulants
Of the exhausted ones
Artifice, brutality and innocence
Artifice and innocence

[Bridge]
Oh and deep in the night, appetites find us
Release us and blind us deep in the night
While madmen sit up building bombs and making laws and bars
They're gonna slam free choice behind us

[Verse 4]
Last night I dreamed I saw the planet flicker
Great forests fell like buffalo, everything got sicker
And to the bitter end big business bickered

[Chorus]
And they call for the three great stimulants
Of the exhausted ones
Artifice, brutality and innocence
Artifice and innocence

[Outro]
Oh these times, these times
Oh these changing times
Change in the heart of all mankind
Oh these troubled times
I've been watching you from afar
For as long as I can remember
You're all a real man could need
And could ever ask for baby
This is more than a crush
Yeah

It was Harlem at the rukus
I saw you with your man, a smiling, huh
A coach bag in your hand
I was laying in the coupe with my hat turned back
We caught eyes for a moment and that was that

So I skated off as you strolled off
Looking at your legs, god damn, they look so soft (so fine)
I gotta take ya from your man, that's my mission
If his love is real he's got to handle competition
You only knew him for five months, that's right
Besides he drinks too much, and smokes too many blunts

And I'll be working out everyday thinkin' about you
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view
Catching flashbacks of our eye contact
Wish I could lay you on your stomach and caress your back
I would hold you in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I ain't had a crush in years
Chorus:
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush, lover
Hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush

I see you at the bus stop waiting every day
Your man must think it's safe for you to travel that way
And I don't want to violate your relationship
So I'll lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip

Still he can't stop me from having daydreams
Tongue'n you down with uh, vanilla ice cream
Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
Searching you body with my tongue girl all night

I wonder one day could it be, I wonder
Simple dreams could turn into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the aisle of destiny

Would your man get his hustle on, got your type scared
Break your off a little chump change to do your hair
It seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you follow our lead
Chorus

Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standing at the pay phone about to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
Telling you come by and then you walked in

I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about traveling the distant lands
Escaping all the madness out here in the world
Becoming my wife no longer my girl

Then you let your dress fall down to the floor
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparalleled
Into an ocean of love we both fell

Swimming in the timeless currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchanging with each kiss
Undying passion unites our souls
Together we swim until the point of no control

But, it's a fantasy, you won't come true
We never even spoke and your man swears he loves you
So, I'm gonna keep all these feelings aside, that's right
Keep my dreams alive until the right time
Chorus
This is just a little samba, built upon a single note
Other notes are bound to follow, but the root is still that note
Now this new one is the consequence of the one we've just been through
As I'm bound to be the unavoidable consequence of you

There's so many people who can talk and talk and talk
And just say nothing, or nearly nothing
I have used up all the scale I know and at the end
I've come to nothing, or nearly nothing

So I come back to my first note, as I must come back to you
I will pour into that one note, all the love I feel for you
Any one who wants the whole show, re-mi-fa-sol-la-si-do
He will find himself with no show, better play the note you know
Now let's talk it over, baby, 'fore we start
I heard about the way you over do your part
So don't you lie to me
Don't you lie to me, baby
'Cause it makes me mad
And I get as evil as a man can be
Now there's two kinda people that
I just can't stand
That's a lyin' woman and a sneakin' man
Don't ya lie to me
Don't you lie to me
You know it makes me mad
And I get as evil as a man can be

Baby, here's a proposition that I'll give to you
I'll give you all my lovin'
If you give me your's too
Don't you lie to me, baby
Don't you lie to me
You know it makes me mad
And I get as evil as a man can be
I'll be with you 'til the cows come home
But, please don't let me catch ya get down low
Don't ya lie to me, baby
No don't lie to me
Ya see it makes me mad
And I get as evil as a man can be
Don't you lie to me
Don't you lie to me
Don't lie to me, baby
Don't you lie to me
Ya see it makes me mad
And I get as evil as a man can be

See, I'll be with you 'til the cows come home
But, please don't let me catch ya get down low
Don't ya lie to me
No don't lie to me
'Cause it makes me mad
And I get as evil as a man can be

Hey, baby, here's a proposition I'll give to you

I'll give you all my lovin'
If you give me your's too
Don't ya lie to me, baby
Don't you lie to me
Ya see it makes me mad
And I get as evil as a man can be
Now, don't you lie to me
Don't you lie to me
Don't you lie to me, baby, yes sir
Don't you lie to me
Ya see it makes me mad
And I get as evil as a man can be
I think I'm gonna tell ya again
Now Don't you lie to me
Now don't you lie
Don't you lie to me, baby
Don't you lie
'Cause ya see it makes me mad
And I get as evil as a man can be
Yes I do
Sugar
Talk to me
Talk to me
Don't you lie to me

Heard about the way you over do your part
So, let's, let's talk it over, baby, be-fore we start
Don't you lie to me
Don't you lie to me
Ya see it makes me mad
And I get as evil as a man can be
Oh...
Don't you lie to me
Alright
I like it I LIKE it!
Don't you lie to me
I wish I was an apple, a-hangin' on a tree
And every time my Cindy passed, she'd take a little bite of me

Get along, home, Cindy, Cindy, get along home
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy
I'll marry you one day

Well, Cindy is my honey the sweetest in the south
When we kissed to bees would all swarm around her mouth

Get along, home, Cindy, Cindy, get along home
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy, I'll marry you one day

Well, I wish I had a needle and thread, fine as I could sew
I'd sew my Cindy to my side and down the road I'd go

Get along, home, Cindy, Cindy, get along home
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy, I'll marry you one day

Well, Cindy got religion. She'd had it once before
She grabbed my ole banjo, man and throw it on the floor
Get along, home, Cindy, Cindy, get along home
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy, I'll marry you one day

Well, it's apples in the summer time, peaches in the fall
If I can't have the gal I want I won't have none at all

Get along, home, Cindy, Cindy, get along home
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy, I'll marry you one day

Cindy hugged and kissed me, she hung her head and cried
I swore she was the prettiest thing that ever lived or died

Get along, home, Cindy, Cindy, get along home
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy, I'll marry you one day
I'll marry you one day
We are sailing in a ship that's got no sails
We are riding on a train right off the rails
We are in an old sedan that's lost a wheel
But it makes no difference to the way we feel

It's been a long time - seems like a lifetime
To be where we are
Take a little tumble, fall and maybe stumble
Now we've gone so far

All along the highways of the sun

No one knows how far it is we have to go
Because every step we take reveals some more
But we'll keep right on as far as the eye can see
Over there where land and sky appear to be

Cruising down the highways of the sun

All along the highways of the sun
Nobody loves me but my mother
And she could be jivin' too
Nobody loves me but my mother
And she could be jivin' too
Now you see why I act so funny, baby
When you do the things you do

[Verse 1]
Strong and wrong, you win
Only because that's the way its always been
Men love war, that's what history's for
A mass-murder mystery, his story

[Verse 2]
Strong and wrong, you lose everything
Without the heart you need to hear a robin sing
Where have all the songbirds gone? Gone!
All I hear are crows in flight
Singing might is right, might is right

[Chorus]
The dawn of man comes slow
Thousands of years and here we are
Still worshiping our own egos

[Verse 3]
Strong and wrong, what is God's will?
Onward Christian soldiers, or thou shall not kill
Men love war, is that what God is for?
Just a rabbit's foot, just a lucky paw
For shock and awe, shock and awe

[Chorus]
The dawn of man comes slow
Thousands of years and here we are
Still worshiping our own egos

[Outro]
Strong and wrong
Strong and wrong

[Verse 1: Shawn Stockman, Boyz II Men]
Look at us, just the way God intended us to be
Look up at the mirror to see you on top of me
What we're doing right now has been done before
Still, it feels so new (Don't you agree?)
Never want this to end baby
But it's hard to keep it all in, baby
Keep this key inside your box
'Til it's time to open up for me
Let me set you free

[Pre-Chorus: Boyz II Men, Shawn Stockman]
I've been feenin' for you all night (All night, yeah)
And I know that thing (Baby) gonna be right
Said it's gonna be right, here I go

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Oh my goodness here it comes, I'm on my way
Baby, all I got will fill you up and make it okay
The expression on my face
Lets you know what's 'bout to take place
Pull me close so you can feel me
As you wrap your legs around me
And never let me go, oh no

[Verse 2: Nathan Morris, Boyz II Men]
Tell me why, is that a tear I see in your eye
Baby, are you cryin' 'cause it's over
Or 'cause it feels so good inside?
I feel you trembling
And I know it's not because you're cold
'Cause you know
(Know I found the spot, you've been looking for)
'Cause you deserve it so more

[Pre-Chorus: Boyz II Men, Nathan Morris]
You've been feenin' for this all night
(You've been feenin', baby, all night)
And you know this thing's gonna be right
(Girl, you know and you know it's gon' be right, yeah)

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Nathan Morris]
Oh my goodness here it comes, I'm on my way
(I'm on my way)
Baby, all I got will fill you up and make it okay
(It'll make it okay, yeah)
The expression on my face
(Can you see my emotion)
Lets you know what's 'bout to take place
(Oh oh oh oh)
Pull me close so you can feel me
As you wrap your legs around me
And never let me go (Never let me go), oh no

[Bridge: Wanya Morris]
Let me feel the rain on my fingertips
Let me kiss your back and around your hips
Don't let it go, mami, keep your grip
Forever and ever and ever, oh

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
Oh my goodness here it comes, I'm on my way
(Said I'm on my way)
Baby, all I got will fill you up and make it okay
The expression on my face (Says I love you)
Lets you know what's 'bout to take place
(And I'm 'bout to give it all to you)
Pull me close so you can feel me
As you wrap your legs around me
And never let me go, never let me go
Oh my goodness here it comes, I'm on my way
(Said I'm coming)
Baby, all I got will fill you up and make it okay
The expression on my face (Everything's gonna be)
Lets you know what's 'bout to take place
(Can you feel it?)
Pull me close so you can feel me
As you wrap your legs around me
And never let me go, never let me go
Oh my goodness here it comes, I'm on my way
Baby, all I got will fill you up and make it okay
The expression on my face
Lets you know what's 'bout to take place
Pull me close so you can feel me
As you wrap your legs around me
And never let me go, never let me go
Right now we're sittin' on top of tha' world (alright)
Just me and you girl (girl)
Everything is goin' our way (alright )
But I know there's gonna come a day
When you gonna meet somebody new (oh yeah)
He'll tell you that his love is true (oh yeah)
Will you remember I'm your man
When he's holding your hand
And I love you so
And I, (I), I, (I), I gotta know

If his words are sweet and tender
Will your heart surrender (I gotta know now - yeah right now)
If he bought you silks and lace
Would he soon take my place (I gotta know now - yeah right now)
I'm not puttin' our love to a test (oh yeah)
I just wanna do what's best (oh yeah)
Either you will or you won't
Say you do or you don't
'cause I love you so and I, (I) I, (I), I've gotta know (baby)
(one more thing)

When I'm old and gray
Will you love me the same way (I gotta know now - yeah right now)
When our chips are down
Will you still be around (I gotta know now - yeah right now)
No need in carrying on (oh yeah)
If our love will soon be gone (oh yeah)
Will you turn and go
Knowing I need you so
Tell me tha' truth
'cause I (I) I (I) I 've gotta know
I've tried so many times 2 erase your memory from my mind
Yet, it doesn't ever last 4 long
I see your picture then I hear your voice
Our love must be stronger than before

Every time I see your eyes (Touch me)
Touch me (Hold me)
Every time I hear your voice (Touch me)
Hold me

Here I stand defenseless as I look into your eyes
There's nothing left 2 say or do
U fill my head with promises and all your pretty lies
Would it be so wrong 2 want U by my side?

Every time I see your eyes (Touch me)
Touch me (Hold me)
Every time I hear your voice (Touch me)
Touch me (Hold me)

I'm captured by my senses, lost in your reverie
Our love must be stronger than before
Every time I see your eyes (Touch me)
Oh, hold me, babe (Hold me)
Every time I hear your voice (Touch me)
Touch me (Hold me)

Every time I see your eyes (Touch me)
I wanna hold U, baby (Hold me)
(Hold me, touch me, kiss me all over)
Every time I hear your voice (Touch me)
Hold me, kiss me all over (Hold me)

Every time I see your eyes (Touch me)
Kiss me, baby (Hold me)

Wake up in the morning 10 clock dranking
Party, party, party, let's all get wasted
Shake it for me baby girl, do it butt naked
I'm so wasted, she so wasted shout the bartender
Send 20 more cases

This has been a GPSA
Ghetto public service announcement
We don't get fucked up no more, we get wasted
Gucci Mane, Plies, Fat Boi, wasted
Uh, uh (uh-huh) uh
Yeah, this is for all the sexy ladies out there
Uh, walkin' around downtown
Shoppin' at the malls, yeah
I see you in your sexy jeans
Manicure, pedicure mamis
Your hair is good, yeah, I see you

[Chorus]
Ladies! (You're, so, sexy) so sexy
(Perfect, for, me) And I like you
(You're, so, sexy) so sexy
(Perfect, for, me) and this is for
My ladies that be steady sippin' Cris'
Always lookin' nice, put some ice on they belly or they wrist
Girls that be thick off in they thigh, I wanna kick it in the Chi
They gon' be fuckin' with some Kelly and the Twist'
Baby now look, model girls, Gucci and Prada girls
And all the ghetto divas in the hood
Women that be steady stackin' ends
Rollin Lexus or Benz with rims and know how to keep it lookin' good
Go on witcha fine thick ass
Somebody gon' snatch you so I gotta make you mine quick fast
See I come and pass, I don't really wanna wonder
So I gotta put her numbers on my sidekick fast
Rollin witcha mob workin' hard, gettin' money, pullin' capers
If I ain't got papers you will bring me some beans home
Supervisor givin' orders on the job
But you still lookin' good with them skin-tight jeans on
Lookin' hot in them heels, I think I want that
Come and back it up to the bottom of my throwback
With you rollin' yo' rims lookin' like a Kodak
Watch I drive I wanna smoke, she will roll that
Miss mobstress rollin' with the hardest
Holdin' it down like a female Joe Pesci
And I wanna make her a made woman
And I hope she gon' let me, cause she looks so sexy
Oh! And this is for them girls that be wantin', dutty
And this is for them girls that be lovin', dutty
And this is for them girls that be ridin', dutty
The ones that like to keep the D up inside 'em now
So many girls off up in the mall boy a nigga be in the club (oh!)
Soon as one of them walk by me and I be like, "Yo whats up?"

[Chorus]
All the shrimp and lobster honeys, downtown shoppin' honeys
Stayin' on the grind, gotcha own car and crib honeys
Dro puffers, Remi sippers, V.I.P. real honeys
No dummies, takin' no shit from a nigga that's full of shit honeys

[Chorus]
Me and my clique was, rollin' thick on 24's on a dirty lick
Met a chick, lookin' fine and her measures was
36-24-36, come here shorty
Ain't no reason to be scared of us
Lovin' how you do your own thang
And how you smokin' on your own flame
Lookin' finer than a girl that be groovin' on Soul Train
I try to to hit her with some cold game
I hope she, feel me, try to holla at a shorty
Get a better vibe wit her while I'm sippin' on my, Henny
I wanna kiss her on her body
But I gotta make her holla while I'm givin' her, dutty
Gotta really love a girl
They know to kick it but she know she gotta make that, money
Goin' shoppin' for the minks and the leather
But come back and bounce that ass, for me
My East coast girls, that's what's up
Tell my South side shorties we can get it crunk
My Cali girl make it bounce like a six-fo'
My Chi girl bust down, make it straight buck
When I see up all the girls that get down for hers
I gotta get up wit her if she gon' let me
Career woman with some goals, fuck the broke-ass hoes
Baby girl cause you look so sexy

[Chorus]
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hotspot
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They took all the trees, put them in a tree museum
And they charged the people
A dollar and a half just to see 'em
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

Hey farmer, farmer, put away the DDT now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees, please
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
Late last night, I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

I said, don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
Ah ha ha ha
Mother Nature
Go on and take your course
And a-take me with you
Hey, I wanna leave here, oh oh

Mother Nature
Take the chains off me (please)
As long as I'm livin', livin'
Hey, I wanna be free, hey

Come on and let your sweet wine
Rush to my head
And make me feel fine

Let me stand naked in the sun
Hiding from no one
Hey, hey, hey

Mother Nature
Come on and do your thing
(I'm begging you, Mother)
I want to start feeling, hey
All those good things you can bring
Hey, hey
Oh oh, day in, day out, 9 to 5
Leaves me half alive
And I'm going nowhere
I can't live in this classic world
It's killing me
Can't you see
You're the only one to turn to

Mother Nature
Go on and take your course
But take me with you, with you
Hey, I wanna leave here

Mother Nature, I wanna leave here
Oh, Mother
Hey old pal
How've you been doing
I'm really not foolin'
I'm so glad to see you
Hey old pal
My life's been kind of crazy
I'm ready to be lazy
Hangin' around with you

Well even in the very, very worst of times
There's one thing that I know
The way to guarantee
A little peace of mind
Is a walk in the woods
A friend by your side
And here we go

Hey old pal
It's great to be here with you
The thing I'd like to give you
Is a real good time
Hey old pal
I really can't believe it
But now that you can see it
It looks just fine
What a chance to play and sing
And have some fun
The day should never end
This will be a rocky mountain holiday
With you and me
And all we can see
And all of our friends

Hey old pal
We must be daydreamin'
At least the things we're seein'
Are a dream come true
Hey there gang
It's great to be together
It just keeps gettin' better
I can promise you

This is going to be
The very best of times
And we will make it so
No more hustle and bustle
And no more telephone lines
And now that we're here
Let's grab all our gear
And off we go
I've got sunshine
On a cloudy day
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
"What can make me feel this way?"
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl
I've got so much honey
The bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song
Than the birds in the trees
Well, I guess you'd say
"What can make me feel this way?"
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl
I don't need no money
Fortune or fame
I got all the riches baby
One man can claim
Well, I guess you'd say
"What can make me feel this way?"
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl
I got sunshine on a cloudy day with my girl
I've even got the month of May with my girl
Talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl
That's all I can talk 'bout is my girl
Why don't you believe she's all my girl?
Dawn came sneaking
Like a skinny snake
The harder they go
The harder I ache
Get so high
Got so low
Somebody tell me
'Bout this debt I owe

West side bomber
Looked like a comer
Looked like I'll be back at school
Put two on the nose
And look how she goes
Little trained squeeze
Look like a fool
Rock on..

And I'm gone
Stone gone
Said you can forget about me
And I'm gone
Stone gone
Working girls
Just tryin to get ahead
Somebody's bound
To end up dead
And honey
You better stop coming down on me
On me
Stop

Jump Street

Sally comes creeping
At the break of dawn
Can't figure out
Whose side I'm on
Bomber comes back
Like a ringin' a bell
Knows a good thing
And she knows it well

Well enough best left alone
Wish your mamma
Had kept you at home
Wish your mamma
Had kept the evidence
Worryin' about the Feds
Has crucified me for dead
She wish I was dead
Well I wish I was dead
But I'm gone
Stone gone
As gone as I can be
And I'm gone
So gone

Don't look much
Like a Saturday night
Honey
Don't look for those flashing lights
But baby
You'd better stop coming down on me
Stop coming down on me
I don't need it
Stop coming down.. on me

Ow!

Jump Street

And I'm gone
Stone gone
You can forget about me yeah
I'm gone
Stone gone
So long
Workin' girls
Just tryin' to get ahead
Somebody's bound
To end up dead
Honey
You better stop comin' down on me
Stop your comin' down
Stop comin' down on me yeah
Stop comin' down on me

Look out funk

Jump Street

[Verse 1]
There's a train leaving here tomorrow (Leaving here)
And I'll be a free, free man once again (A free man)
I'm so glad I served my time, I'm gonna meet the girl that I left behind

[Chorus]
And when I see her, I'm gonna give her all the love I've got
Ooo, when I see her, I'm gonna give her, little girl, all the love I've got

[Verse 2]
There were times, there were times when each day seems like a year
But the sweet things she said in her letters, made the times disappear, oh yeah
She said, No one's arms will I let hold me 'cause in your arms is where I want to be

[Chorus]
So when I see her, I'm gonna give her, little girl, all the love I've got
Ooo, when I see her, (I'm gonna give her all) all the love I've got

[Bridge]
Ooo, baby, baby, baby, I miss you so. Ugh!
Hmmm (Aw)

[Verse 3]
Countless nights I stared out my window at the moonlight, yes I did now
Thinking about the way I used to hold her tight, oh yeah
I must have been out of my mind to do the wrong I did and leave her behind

[Chorus]
So when I see her, I'm gonna give her all the love I've got
Woo, when I see her, I'm gonna give her, little girl, all the love I've got

[Outro]
Believe me when I tell ya
When I see her, I'm gonna give her all the love I've got
Feel I'm goin' back to Massachusetts
Something is telling me I must go home
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
The day I left her standing on her own

Tried to hitch a ride to San Francisco
Gotta do the things I wanna do
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
They brought me back to see my way with you

Talk about the life in Massachusetts
Speak about the people I have seen
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen

I will remember Massachusetts

[Verse 1]
Fly silly seabird, no dreams can possess you
No voices can blame you for sun on your wings
My gentle relations have names they must call me
For loving the freedom of all flying things

[Chorus]
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach, out of cry

[Verse 2]
I came to the city and lived like old Crusoe
On an island of noise in a cobblestone sea
And the beaches were concrete and the stars paid a light bill
And the blossoms hung false on their store window trees

[Chorus]
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach, out of cry

[Verse 3]
Out of the city and down to the seaside
To sun on my shoulders and wind in my hair
But sandcastles crumble and hunger is human
And humans are hungry for worlds they can't share

[Chorus]
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach, out of cry

[Verse 4]
I call to a seagull who dives to the waters
And catches his silver-fine dinner alone
Crying where are the footprints that danced on these beaches
And the hands that cast wishes that sunk like a stone

[Chorus]
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach, out of cry
Young and free, young and free
How I feel in your company
If only yesterday
I'd hesitate to say
What would become of me

Young and free, young and free
Know too much, know too much
Keeps you old and gray
And out of touch
My words, too quick to sound
The arms are slow to fold around
A knowing touch
Young and free, young and free

The clock alarms, the day begins
The lady charms, the money spends
She's trying on, the satin shoes
She wants to fly to Baton Rouge

Ah, the clock alarms, the day begins
The lady charms, the money spends
She wants to buy, the satin shoes
She wants to fly to Baton Rouge
Autumn day, autumn day
Leaves like birds
Up and flown away
Here's to days I used to wake up dead
Alone, stay in bed
The curtains drawn all day
Young and free, young and free
Young and free, young and free

[Verse 1]
I saw it advertised one day
Bear Mountain Picnic was comin' my way
"Come along 'n' take a trip
We'll bring you up there on a ship
Bring the wife and kids
Bring the whole family."
Yippee

[Verse 2]
Well, I run right down 'n' bought a ticket
To this Bear Mountain Picnic
But little did I realize
I was in for a picnic surprise
Had nothin' to do with mountains
I didn't even come close to a bear

[Verse 3]
Took the wife 'n' kids down to the pier
Six thousand people there
Everybody had a ticket for the trip
"Oh well." I said, "it's a pretty big ship
Besides, anyway, the more the merrier."

[Verse 4]
Well, we all got on 'n' what d'ya think
That big old boat started t' sink
More people kept a-pilin' on
That old ship was a-slowly goin' down
Maybe we just better call off the picnic

[Spoken Interlude]
No, the word there is, uh, instead of maybe better call off the picnic, it's
Funny way t' start a picnic

[Verse 5]
Well, I soon lost track of m' kids 'n' wife
So many people there I never saw in m' life
That old ship sinkin' down in the water
Six thousand people tryin' t' kill each other
Dogs a-barkin', cats a-meowin'
Women a-screamin', fists a-flyin', babies cryin'
Cops a-comin', me a-runnin'
Maybe we just better call off the picnic

[Verse 6]
I got shoved down 'n' pushed around
All I could hear there was a screamin' sound
Don't remember one thing more
Just remember walkin' up on a little shore
Head busted, stomach cracked
Feet splintered, I was bald, naked...
Quite lucky to be alive though

[Verse 7]
Feelin' like I climbed outta m' casket
I grabbed back hold of m' picnic basket
Took the wife 'n' kids 'n' started home
Wishin' I'd never got up that morn

[Verse 8]
Now, I don't care just what you do
If you wanta have a picnic, that's up t' you
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanta hear it
'Cause, see, I just lost all m' picnic spirit
Stay in m' kitchen, have m' own picnic's there...
In the bedroom, In the bathroom

[Verse 9]
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
What some people are gonna do f'r money
There's a bran' new gimmick every day
Just t' take somebody's money away
I think we oughta take some o' these people
And put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain
For a picnic
People get ready, there's a train a'coming
You don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear those diesels humming
You don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord

People get ready, for the train to Jordan
Picking up passengers from coast-to-coast
Faith is key, open up the doors and board them
There's hope for all among the loved the most

But there ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind to save his own
Have pity on those whose choices grow thinner
There's no hiding place from the kingdom's throne

People get ready, there's a train a'coming
You don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear those diesels humming
You don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord
Thank the Lord
Daybreak, another new day
The mist on the meadow is drifting away
For it's daybreak, the sun's in the sky now
And flowers break through their blanket of dew
Sunrise, how lovely it seems
To see from my window a sky full of dreams
As the white clouds sail on through the blue
At daybreak I did dream of you

[Intro - Bret McKenzie]
Oh my god, she's so hot
She's so flipping hot, she's like a curry
I wanna tell her how hot she is but she'll think I'm being sexist
She's so hot, she's making me sexist...bitch
I need my 1987 DG-20 Casio Electric Guitar, set to...mandolin
Yeah...drop the drums!
Hear me now!

[Verse 1 - Bret McKenzie]
I see you give the sign I wanna Boom like it's never been done
Bust a move it's like the click-Boom of a gun
In the Marquee in the bass is Booming
Someone's smoking Boom at da back of da room
And it's the first day of Boom, and the flowers are blooming
Drum Boom bass and the party is Booming
Boom ba Boom like a rocket taking off to da moon
Boom Boom like a bride and Boom ahh

[Chorus - Bret McKenzie (Jemaine Clement)]
See ya shaking that Boom Boom ahh
See ya looking at my Boom Boom ahh
See ya want some Boom Boom
It's clear it's Boomtime Boom Boom ahh
Let me buy you a Boom Boom ahh
You order a fancy Boom ahh
You like Boom, and I like Boom
Enough small Boom lets Boom the Boom ahh
(Fast-forward selecta!)

[Verse 2 - Bret McKenzie (Jemaine Clement)]
Now we're rollin' in a Boom Boom ahh
Ridin' to my private room
And we know what's happening, we both assume
We gonna Boom Boom Boom ‘til the break of Boom
Who's the Boom King? (Who?)
I'm the Boom King! (What?)
Who's the Boom King? (Tell me now!)
I'm the Boom King! (He's the Boom King!)

[Bridge - Bret McKenzie]
Chaka chaka chaka hahaha
Chaka chaka chaka hahaha
Chaka chaka chaka hahaha
Chaka chaka chaka hahaha

[Verse 3 - Bret McKenzie]
My phone is beepin' it's Big-Booms-Boom
Is back from ten years doom and gloom
And they said he had his Boom chopped off in the Boom
But the crazy Boom still loves the Boom, ahh
Unzip the Boom, and my legs go zoom
My Bee-Boom jumps, ba-roomba-Boom-Boom
We both get freaky then the Boom gets squeaky
And we Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom! aah

[Outro - Bret McKenzie (Jemaine Clement)]
Who's the Boom King? (Who?)
I'm the Boom King! (What?)
Who's the Boom King? (Ha!)
I'm the Boom King! (Bret's the Boom King!)
Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say why did you do it with him today?
And sniff me out like I was tanqueray
Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore

[Estribillo:]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya, I was troubled
You know that I'm no good
Upstairs in bed, with my ex boy
He's in the place, but I can't get joy
Thinking of you in the final throws
This is when my buzzer goes
Run out to meet your chicks and bitter
You say when we're married cause you're not bitter
There'll be none of him no more
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

[Repetir estribillo]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya, I was troubled
You know that I'm no good
Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub you're on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet
Then you notice lickle carpet burn
My stomach drops and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst
To truly stuck the knife in first

[Chorus x2]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya, I was troubled
You know that I'm no good
As I approach the prime of my life
I find I have the time of my life
Learning to enjoy at my leasure
All the simple pleasure
And so I happily concede

This is all I ask
This is all I need

Beautiful girl, walk a little slower when you walk by me
Lingering sunset, stay a little longer with the lonely sea
Children everywhere, when you shoot at bad men, shoot at me
Take me to that strange enchanted land
Grownups seldom understand

Wandering rainbows, leave a bit of color for my heart to own
Stars in the sky, make my wish come true
Before the night has flown
And let the music play as long as there's a song to sing
Then I will stay younger than spring

[Ice-T]
Yeah, sh*t is going down again!
This motherf**kers want me back in! f**k!

[Method Man: Word up, our niggas is strapped, ready for war!]

Big wheels keep on turning
Carry me home to see my kin
Singing songs about the south-land
I miss 'ole' 'bamy once again
And I think it's a sin

Well I heard Mister Young sing about her
Well I heard ole Neil put her down
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember
A southern man don't need him around any how

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

In Birmingham they love the Gov'nor
Now we all did what we could do
Now Watergate does not bother me
Does your conscience bother you?
Tell the truth
Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers
And they've been known to pick a song or two
Lord they get me off so much
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue
Now how bout you?

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you
Walkin' down by the river
Water running through my knees (ooh)
River, oh river moves so free (ooh)
Oh mighty river endlessly

Ooh, mighty river
I would love to be like you
Ooh, lonely river
Has not got the time to say

I was born into the city life
It's all that I've ever known
You know it's rough gettin' round this place
So crowded I can hardly breathe

You can only see about a block or two
In L. A. that's the truth
I'm lookin' for some country life
Some kickin' room no more city life
I want the river
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on river
(I got to get away, I got to get away, I got to get away)
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on river
(I got to get away, I got to get away, I got to get away)
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on river
(I got to get away, I got to get away, I got to get away)
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on river
(I got to get away, I got to get away, I got to get away)
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on

It breaks my heart to see the city
I wonder why it ain't pretty
Oh I want to cry, want to cry

Come on you've got to do it, do it, do it
You got to run away, you got to run away
You got to do it, do it, do it
You got to run away, you got to run away
You got to do it, do it, do it
You got to run away, you got to run away
If I were a carpenter and you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway
Would you have my baby
If a tinker was my trade would you still find me
Carrying the pots I made
Following behind me

Save my love thru loneliness
Save my love for sorrow
I’ve given you my onliness
Come and give me your tomorrow

If I worked my hands in wood
Would you still love me
Answer me babe yes I would
I put you above me
If I were a miller and a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your colored blouse
Your soft shoes shinning

Save my love thru loneliness
I save my love for sorrow
I’ve given you my onliness
Come and give me your tomorrow
If I were a carpenter and you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway
Would you have my baby
I’m a carpenter, just a carpenter
I’m a carpenter, just a carpenter
Bruno Mars
Truth of the matter is I'm complicated
You're as straight as they come
You go about your day, baby
While I hide from the sun

It's better if you don't understand
'Cause you won't know what it's like until you try

You know I
I'll be waiting on the other side
And you
All you got to do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just got to decide
You know I will be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side

Cee-Lo
We would live forever
Who could ask for more?
You could die if you wanted
But baby what for?
It's better if you don't understand
And you won't know what it's like until you try

You know I
I'll be waiting on the other side
And you
All you got to do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just got to decide
You know I I'll be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side

B.o.B
If they say life's a dream, call this insomnia
'Cause this ain't Wonderland it damn sure ain't Narnia
And once you cross the line You can't change your mind
Yeah I'm a monster but I'm no Frankenstein
And quite frankly I've been feelin' insane In between my eyes
I really can't explain what I feel inside
If you knew what I was you'd run and hide (huh)
Many have tried to go into the night
And cross over the line and come back alive
But that's the price we payin' when we livin' on the other side

Bruno Mars
You know I
I'll be waiting on the other side
And you
All you got to do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just got to decide
You know I I'll be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side
Bruno Mars & Cee-Lo Green
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
Hey, little girl, is your daddy home
Did he go away and leave you all alone
I got a bad desire
I'm on fire

Tell me now, baby, is he good to you
Can he do to you the things that I do
I can take you higher
I'm on fire

It's like someone took a knife, edgy and dull
Dug a six-inch valley In the middle of my skull

At night, I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
Freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire

Hey, little girl, is your daddy home
Did he go away and leave you all alone
I got a bad desire
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire
And tell me now, baby, is he good to you
Can he do to you the things that I do
I can take you higher
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire
I'm on fire

I'm on fire
Boom-Boom-Boom-Boom-Boom-Boom-Boom
Farewell, my love
Farewell, my love
I love you more than anything
No one knows the good you bring
To me

But I've got to set you free. (Boo-oo)
I've just got to set you free. (Boo-oo)

Aww, goodbye, (Goodbye) my love (My love)
I'm gonna cry, (Gonna cry) my love (My love)
The vow of love you broken
The law of love has spoken
To you

Oh, why couldn't you be true? (Why couldn't you be true?)
Why couldn't you be true? (Why couldn't you be true?)

[Bridge]
So long, baby, you know, it's so hard
It's really hard to find someone in this wide world, who's really true
I guess it's just meant for me to be unhappy
But I believe, I really do believe that somewhere someone is waiting for me
Aww, she's there, (She's there) my love (My love)
Somewhere, (Somewhere) my love (My love)
Someone who cares
And still be there
With me

Oh, my darling can't you see? (Boo-oo)
How wonderful it would be, yeah (Boo-oo)
Farewell, to you
Farewell, my love
We're
Through
We're through
I've got a right to love my baby
She treats me just like a king
Yes, I've got a right to love my woman
She treats me like a king
Yes, she is my mind, body and soul
Yes, my baby, she can do most anything

Yes, she's my doctor when I'm sick, people
She's my all around standby
Oh, she's my lawyer when I'm in trouble, people
She's my mother when I wanna cry
Yes, I've got a right to love my baby
Oh, can't you see the reason why?

Oh, that gives me a right to love my woman
She's always here by my side
Oh, my sweet understanding baby
She makes my temperature rise
Yes, and when it comes to kind treatments, people
My baby's an angel in disguise
Oh, when I'm sick she's my doctor
When I'm well, she's my pride and joy
Yes, when I'm cold she's my cover
Yes, she calls me a little baby boy
Yes, when I'm tired and wanna play, people
It's my baby that's my toy
All of your affection is gone baby and your love is growing cold
I've said all of your affection is gone baby and your love is growing cold
Hey, I've got a new story to tell you this evening, baby
One that ain't never been told

I went to work the other day
But I thought that I would double back
And that car I saw sitting in front of my door
Looked like a brand new, a brand new Cadillac, yeah!

I ain't got none now baby
I think you've been cheating on me
I believe to my soul baby, that you've given me some outside help
That I don't think I really need

The iceman came by this morning
And you know he didn't leave no ice
The postman came by later baby
And he didn't even ring twice

I think you've been cheating on me
I think you're running out on me
I believe to my soul baby, that you've given me some outside help
That I don't think I really need

Now, I want you to tell the iceman
The next time he'd better leave some ice
And I want you to tell the postman
He'd better ring more than twice
And when I come home from work in the morning
Better still be some groceries on the shelf
I want to tell that slick insurance man
That he'd better write some insurance on his self

Yes, I think you've been cheating on me
I think you're running out on me
I believe to my soul baby, that you've given me some help, some help
Some help, I don't really need
I was cutting the rug down at a place called The Jug
With a girl named Linda Lou
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand
And he was looking for you-know-who
He said, "Hey there fellow with the hair colored yellow
Whatcha tryin' to prove?
'Cause that's my woman there and I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you"

I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shakin' like a leaf on a tree
'Cause he was lean, mean, big and bad, Lord
Pointin' that gun at me
"Oh, wait a minute, mister, I didn't even kiss her
Don't want no trouble wit' chu
And I know you don't owe me but I wish you would let me
Ask one favor from you"

"Won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see a-me no more"
For sure
Well, the crowd cleared away and I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And I'm telling you son, well it ain't no fun
Staring straight down a forty-four
Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lou
And that's the break I was looking for
And you could hear me screaming a mile away
As I was headed out towards the door

"Won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see a-me no more"
Show me the back door
You know by now that I've been passed
Through an awful lot of hands
And all I have is what is left
From ten thousand one night stands

Sometimes I feel like I was there
When the blues began
With this crying guitar holding me
Like a woman holds a man

Let me make you cry a little longer
Let me make you high a little longer
Oh, I want to try a little longer
Make some woman sigh a little longer

At night sometimes I can still feel
Every place I've ever been
I feel it in my music
And it all comes back again

You know I've played for city lights
And for stars above
And every note I ever play
I always play for love
Let me make you cry a little longer
Let me make you high a little longer
Oh, I want to try a little longer
Make some woman sigh a little longer

[Intro]
Found my dream come true

[Verse 1]
At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song, sweet song
At Last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover the night I looked at you

I found a dream that I can speak to
A dream that I can call my own (I can call my own)
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known (I've never known)
You smiled, you smiled, you smiled and then the spell was cast (And then the spell was cast)
And here we are in Heaven (Heaven, Heaven, Heaven, Heaven)
For you are mine at last

[Chorus]
At last, at last, at last
I'm gonna be with you
(At last, my love as come along)
At last, at last, at last
I'm gonna be with you
I found a dream that I can speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I've never known

(You smiled) You smiled, you smiled, oh, yes you did
And then the spell was cast (And then the spell was cast)
Right now, here we are in Heaven (Heaven, Heaven, Heaven, Heaven)
And you are mine at last

[Chorus]
One by one the teardrops fall as I write you
One by one my words come falling on the page
One by one my dreams are fading in the twilight
One by one my schemes are fading fast away

One by one the flowers fading in my garden
One by one the leaves are falling from the trees
One by one my hopes are vanished in the clouds clear
One by one like snowflakes melting in the breeze

One by one my hair is turning gray
One by one my dreams are fading fast away
One by one I read your letters over
One by one I lay them all away

One by one the days are slipping up behind you
One by one the sweetest days of life go by
One by one the moments stealing out behind you
One by one she'll come and find not you or I

One by one I hear the soft words that you whispered
One by one I feel your kisses soft and sweet
One by one I hope you'll say the words to marry
One by one to one by one forever be
Every day in the week I'm in a different city
If I stay too long people try to pull me down
They talk about me like a dog
Talkin' about the clothes I wear
But they don't realize they're the ones who's square

Hey!
And that's why
You can't hold me down
I don't want to be down
I gotta move
Hey

Stone free do what I please
Stone free to ride the breeze
Stone free I can't stay
I got to got to got to get away

Alright
Listen to this baby
A woman here a woman there try to keep me in a plastic cage
But they don't realize it's so easy to break
Oh, but sometimes I get--ha
I can feel my heart kind of runnin' hot
That's when I've got to move before I get caught

And that's why
Listen to me baby, you can't hold me down
I don't want to be tied down
I gotta be free
Ow!

I said
Stone free do what I please
Stone free to ride the breeze
Stone free I can't stay
Got to got to got to get away
Yeah, ow!
Turn me loose baby

Yeah!
Stone free to ride on the breeze
Stone free do what I please
Stone free I can't stay
Stone free got to got to get away
Stone free I'm gonna leave right now
Stone free don't try to hold me back baby
Stone free I'm movin' on down the highway, yeah
Stone free got to got to got to got to
Stone free bye bye baby
Stone free
:b
I quit my job this mornin'
I don't want to work no more
Fuck MacDonald's and Taco Bell
That modern day slavery is knockin on my front door
(I don't fit in the corporate world man)
Get you a big fat sack o' yayo
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Can't see a way to control my dog-on life
Hungryyyy hustlas

(Afroman)
Got hired at the dope spot
I'm an employee
Cookin' crack like a black Chef Boyardee
Got Meth, speed, whatever you need
Zigzags come free wit a bag of weed
If You want some sure, go talk to her
The skinny black dude wit the real long perm
Laptop computers, rap CDs, Motorola phones, Sony color TVs
Got the porno tapes in the back of the car, get it free when you buy a hot VCR
Got gats and D's, car batteries
Getting money with my folks on a hundred spokes
Cops ain't waiters, we don't tip em
Treat cars like women take em home and strip em
Match the pink slips, get the smog inspection
Put a add in the paper in the classified section
Cause' I don't want to work no more
(Fuck that shit)
Modern day slavery knocking on my front door
(Fuck that shit)
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Can't see a way to control my own life
Cause I don't want to work no more
Modern day slavery knockin on my front door
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Can't see a way to control my damn life, motherfucker
(Melody)
I quit my job this morning'
I don't want to work no more
Fuck MacDonald's and Taco Bell
Modern day slavery is knocking on my front door
Get you a big fat sack of yayo
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Can't see a way to control my dog-on life
Tell the Neighborhood watch, tell the Neighborhood listen
Tell the neighborhood ya big screen television missin'
New in my hood, I got to come to ya
Steal ya car battery and sell it back to ya
Then I come back, just for kicks
I leave ya car sitin' on four big bricks
All I need now is some vascus homes
Cause my garage looks just like auto zone
What you say man? Ya need another beeper?
Buy from me, cause it's a whole lot cheaper
Got a cellular phone, and ya really oughta get it
Fo a limited time, brother, the chip come wit it
So come to my house, when the times is hard
It's just like Vegas in my back yard
I keep my Afro pick, my khakis creased
And my next-door neighbors callin up the police
Cause' I don't want to work no more
Modern day slavery knockin on my front door
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Can't see a way to control my own life
I said cause' I don't want to work no more
Modern day slavery knockin on my front door
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Can't see a way to control my damn life
(Melody)

Rough, reckless, snatch yo necklace
Sell it on the corner and buy myself breakfast
I made in an hour or more
So what the fuck do I want to get job for?
So the yuppies the guppies, can floss their power
My black ass five dollas an hour
And the fact is, after taxes, got to live
Where the Mexicans and the blacks is mother fucker
Crooked police, gangs in chuck tailors
Bums sleeping in fuckin trucks and trailers
Three hundred dollors every two weeks
From the stupid, tired, penny pinching pencil neck geeks
Abraham Lincoln told me I was free
So ima walk to corner and do what I want to
While you at work ill be watchin cable
Wit ya girl dancin' naked on my new pool table
I don't want to work no more
Modern day slavery knockin on my front door
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Can't see a way to control my own life
Said I don't want to work no more
Modern day slavery knockin on my front door
Can't see my kids can't see..
Ah man I got to sell like a twenty doller rock, y'all keep singing, Ill be right back
(Melody)
I quit my job this morning'
I don't want to work no more
Fuck MacDonald's and Taco Bell, modern day slave rails
Is knocking on my front door
Get you a big fat sack of yayo
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Can't see a way to control my dog-on life
:b
Seven o'clock in the morning
And the rays from the sun wakes me
I'm stretchin' and yawnin'
In a bed that don't belong to me
And a voice yells, "Good morning, darlin", from the bathroom
Then she comes out and kisses me
And to my surprise, she ain't you
Now I've got this dumb look on my face
Like, what have I done?
How could I be so stupid to be have laid here til the morning sun?
Lost the track of time
Oh, what was on my mind?
From the club, went to her home
Didn't plan to stay that long
Here I am, quickly tryin' to put on my clothes
Searching for my car keys
Tryin' to get on up out the door
Then she stretched her hands in front of it
Said, "You can't go this way"
Looked at her, like she was crazy
Said, "Woman move out my way"
Said, "I got a wife at home"
She said, "Please don't go out there"
"Lady, I've got to get home"
She said, her husband was comin' up the stairs
"Shh, shh, quiet
Hurry up and get in the closet"
She said, "Don't you make a sound
Or some shit is going down"
I said, "Why don't I just go out the window?"
"Yes, except for one thing, we on the 5th floor"
"Shit think, shit think, shit quick, put me in the closet"
And now I'm in this darkest closet, tryin' to figure out
Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house
Then he walks in and yells, "I'm home"
She says, "Honey, I'm in the room"
Walks in there with a smile on his face
Sayin', "Honey, I've been missin' you"
She hops all over him
And says, "I've cooked and ran your bath water?
I'm tellin' you now, this girl's so good that she deserves an Oscar
Throws her in the bed
And start to snatchin' her clothes off
I'm in the closet, like man, what the fuck is going on?
You're not gonna believe it
But things get deeper as the story goes on
Next thing you know, a call comes through on my cell phone
I tried my best to quickly put it on vibrate
But from the way he act, I could tell it was too late
He hopped up and said, "There's a mystery going on
And I'm gonna solve it"
And I'm like, "God please, don't let this man open this closet?
He walks in the bathroom
And looks behind the door
She says, "Baby, come back to bed"
He says, "Bitch say no more"
He pulls back the shower curtain
While she's biting her nails
Then he walks back to the room
Right now, I'm sweating like hell
Checks under the bed
Then under the dresser
He looks at the closet
I pull out my Beretta
He walks up to the closet
He goes up to the closet
Now he's at the closet
Damn he's opening the closet?
Ooh
See your face - you've got no-one to love you back
You be
