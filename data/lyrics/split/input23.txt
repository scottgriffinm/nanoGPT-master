[Verse 1]
The way I see it, he said, you just can't win it
Everybody's in it for their own gain
You can't please 'em all
There's always somebody calling you down
I do my best and I do good business
There's a lot of people asking for my time
They're trying to get ahead
They're trying to be a good friend of mine

[Chorus]
I was a free man in Paris, I felt unfettered and alive
There was nobody calling me up for favors
And no one's future to decide
You know I'd go back there tomorrow
But for the work I've taken on
Stoking the star maker machinery behind the popular song

[Verse 2]
I deal in dreamers and telephone screamers
Lately I wonder what I do it for
If l had my way, I'd just walk through those doors
And wander down the Champs-Élysées
Going café to cabaret
Thinking how I'll feel when I find
That very good friend of mine

[Chorus]
I was a free man in Paris, I felt unfettered and alive
Nobody was calling me up for favors
No one's future to decide
You know I'd go back there tomorrow
But for the work I've taken on
Stoking the star maker machinery behind the popular song

[Intro]
Hmm, hmm, alright
Hmm, hmm, hmm

[Verse 1]
Drinking again, drinking again
Bottles up, I'm in it to win
With none of my friends, just me and this bottle
People say that I'm off, say that I'm off
I wouldn't doubt it if you were me
Free as a bird, flying over mountains
And I don't know where I'm going
But I'm going

[Chorus]
It's all happening
I'm going
It's all happening

[Verse 2]
Hate what I see, hate what I see
I'm over it, I need me some change
Something to feel good, get me on a level
No, no, no need to cry, no need to cry
You straighten up, you're such an adult
You pay all your bills, yet you are a zombie
And you don't know where you're going
But you're going

[Chorus]
It's all happening
I'm going
It's all happening
We're going
It's all happening

[Hook: Lou Reed]
Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold
Some kind of majesty
Some chemical load

[Verse 1: Lou Reed]
Some kind of metal
Made up from glue
Some kind of plastic
I could wrap around you
The needy eat man-mades
They wear phony clothes
They sit with barbiturates
Until they grow old

[Hook 1: 2-D]
Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold
Some kind of majesty
Some chemical load

[Verse 2: Lou Reed]
Well, me, I like plastics
And digital foils
To wrap up the sound
And protect the girls
From the spiritual poison
You spill at night
Like phony clothes but
I really like mine

[Hook 2: Lou Reed and 2-D]
Some kind of nature
Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Come forth within us
Oh Lord, forgive me
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold
It's gonna come and find us
All we are is dust

[Verse 3: Lou Reed, 2-D and Both]
Some kind of metal, some kind of metal
Made up from glue, made up from glue
Some kind of plastic, some kind of plastic
I could wrap around you
The needy eat man-mades
They wear phony clothes
They sit with barbiturates
Until they grow old

[Hook 2: Lou Reed and 2-D]
Some kind of nature
Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Come forth within us
Oh Lord, forgive me
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold
It's gonna come and find us
All we are is dust

[Verse 1: Rita Ora]
I heard him speak but then I saw his face
I knew he was the one because I dreamt this day
I was such a beginner on this thing called love
And now he's going away and now I'm torn apart, so torn apart

[Hook: Rita Ora & Snoop Lion]
You're one of them (hey)
You see me sweat (hey)
You pullin' triggers let you sweat another day (hey)
Say goodbye to the one that got away

[Verse 2: Snoop Lion]
Her lips were the very first thing that I saw
She flew like an angel and that made me want her more (want her more)
My reputation says I'm there for love
And now she's going away and now I'm so torn apart
So torn apart

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Snoop Lion & Rita Ora]
Never let you get away
Shouldn'ta let you got away
Get away, got a way
Gotta find another way
Never let ‘em get away
Gotta find a way to stay
Never let ‘em get away
Never let ‘em get away

You never let her go
You never let her go
It feels right

You see me?
You hear me? (Yep)
Hey

[Hook]
Disick: Hey, do you like Kanye West?

Cheban: Yeah, he's okay, I guess

D: Well, the early work was a little too hip-hop for me in my taste, but when Dark Twisted Fantasy came out in 2010, I think he really came into his own, both musically and lyrically

D: Kanye's been compared to Jesus, Hitler, Walt Disney, and even Steve Jobs

C: Hey Disick

D: Yes Jonathan?

C: Why do you have copies of Billboard magazine all over the place? Do you have a little dog - a little chow or something? *laughs*

D: No, Jonathan!

C: Is that a raincoat?

D: Yes, it is! Now, Kanye's decided to release this, Yeezus, his most exciting record so far. It should be obvious by now that "New Slaves" is the undisputed masterpiece of Yeezus. A song so catchy, most people won't even remember the lyrics! But they should. And then there's the song "I Am a God". The title practically speaks for itself, but of course the insecurities of the mainstream music press will never understand its true meaning because it's about me! Hey Jonathan!

D: Try getting the Yeezus album now motherfucker!
(Check this out, DJ E-V)

[Verse]
Heeey, she say I'm different
I'm zoned like, how bitch?
She say, I dress cool
And cause my accent
Oh shit, this girl must want a nut
I'mma jizz up in her face
While I'm palming the butt
Didn't do my struck, cowboy mid-western
She did it all for me, now it's her friends turn
A young for more money, more models with asses
More heat, to spread to the masses
Funky glasses of a freakish nature
I'm crazy cool, nigga's need to learn paper

(Hahahaha, hahahah, hahahahah)
(That's a Cudi free style right there!)

[Verse 1]
Yo
Okay, so I'm kicking it right now
In the studio with my man DJ E-V
And, uhm..
I came here man
It was brought to my attention
By my nigga, Chip Tha Rip
That DJ E-V looks, very, very familiar to me
Like I've seen him before
I've met him once before
But when I met him for the first time, I was like man
I feel like I've seen this nigga somewhere
But, I couldn't really put my finger on it
But I realised, that I've never seen him before
But, I've seen somebody, that looked like the nigga
But then it hit me, this motherfucker looks like Tom Cruise
And I'm not talking about -
He look like motherfucking, Mission impossible 2, Tom Cruise
Motherfucking, Jerry Maguire, Tom Cruise, ya know what I'm saying
Not The Last Samurai, Tom Cruise
But I'll talk about this Tom Cruise
Ya know what I'm saying like, before he went crazy Tom Cruise

[Break]
(DJ E-V)

[Outro]
But naw, if you ever see DJ E-V
Come up to him be like, wassup Tom
You what I'm saying, give him dap
Tell him that you love his movies
And he would definently appreciate that
You heard it from me, heard it from
Kid Cudi, it's the K.I.D
You can call me moon man

[Verse 1]
Versace, Versace
Its killers, real niggas that's all in my posse (shooters!)
I'm getting so rich that they making up rumors that I'm illuminati (rich!)
Just me and my niggas we killin' these bitches, go body for body (murders!)
These suckers be hating, they praying to God that I don't cop a Bugatti
Hold up, drop the top on the rari
Pull in the club and I'm stopping the party
Hold up, got bitches on bitches
They poppin' on molly's I'm prolly at Follies with PeeWee and Tip
Questing with Lou
I did everything that I said I would do
I really won't tell you that I'm better than you
But we're not on the same level as you
Cause the G55 got a hell of a view
Regular niggas make regular moves
With ya regular bitch and ya regular crew
And you nigga still smokin on regular too? Like word?!
What a shame, my nigga
Louboutin blood like Game, my nigga
Get left tryna aim, my nigga
Like Saddam Hussein, my nigga
I'm whippin' this brand new machine
100 bands in my jeans

She done ran through the team
I got hoes out the D
They playing on the team
Do anything for me
I mix that xan with the lean
Hold up, let me get it back
Versace, Versace
I'm gettin' this money, I'm stackin' my broccoli (racks!)
I'm running my city
You might gotta pay me if you land on my property (tax!)
I bought the boardwalk and I parked on the ave
Shit, my life's like monopoly
You caught a new case and you got outta jail
Boy, you look like a cop to me
(Get out of jail free card?)

[Intro]
Ninja? You're a ninja? Get out of here, you're a ninja! Yes, I am a ninja

[Bridge: David Myles]
I read the rules before I broke 'em
I broke the chains before they choked me out
Now I pay close attention
Really learn the code
I learned to read the map before I hit the road

[Verse 1: Classified]
Hey yo, I know you never heard this before
But I'd rather lose a fight than miss the war
And I ain't wishing competition or fishing for it
I'm just living in the system, conditions are poor
I've been lost in the rhythm and misinformed
Too many late nights hitting the liquor store
Too many bad decisions, half-assed attempts
No sweat, no fear, no blood, no tears
I go hard and I ain't making up no excuse
I'm overdue, I don't do what I'm supposed to do
Cause you can think about it man, we're supposed to lose
It ain't all picture perfect, ocean views
No, I was a first class rookie
Taking out bullies in my all black hoodie
Man of mystery, you know the history
Get it or forget it, cause poof, I'm outta here

[Bridge: David Myles]
I read the rules before I broke 'em
I broke the chains before they choked me out
Now I pay close attention
Really learn the code
I learned to read the map before I hit the road

[Hook]
Nobody's gonna see me coming
Nobody's gonna hear a sound
No matter how hard they trying
No stopping me since I've found
My inner ninja (x4)

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
Alright
I'm just feeling like this all year
All these kids used to call me weird
I wish they could just reappear
I wish they could just see me here
You know cause I'm fightin' for my inner, inner
You can never stop me, I'm a winner winner
Couple beats in my backpack
Turn them into plat plaques
And you know, poof, dinner, dinner
Remember back in '09 Kanye told me that my demo was whack (Oh no)
Two years later, Kanye told me that my new shit was dope
And that's because it is, I handled all my biz
A little less eyes, baby
Little more years
Takes a little practice to do it like this
This is in my mind, homie
Run that shit

[Bridge 2: Mike Posner]
I had bad habits but I dropped them
I had opponents, but I knocked them out
I climbed the highest mountain
Swam across the coldest sea
There ain't a thang I've faced that's been too much for me

[Hook]
Nobody's gonna see me coming
Nobody's gonna hear a sound
No matter how hard they trying
Nobody's gonna bring me down

Nobody's gonna see me coming
Nobody's gonna hear a sound
No matter how hard they trying
No stopping me since I've found
My inner ninja (x4)

[Bridge 2: Mike Posner]
I had bad habits but I dropped them
I had opponents, but I knocked them out
I climbed the highest mountain
Swam across the coldest sea
There ain't a thang I've faced that's been too much for me

My inner ninja

[Verse 1]
It's hard where you're living
Adding weight to make it balanced
Saying it could be too much
But he's clasping to his tie

[Verse 2]
There was a finer life
When I was with my friends
And I could always see my family
That's what I still want now
Even if I'm here
And I know they won't be waiting

[Refrain]
Cause I don't want to be alone
I don't want to be here alone

[Verse 3]
While you're there give back a little more
The return could make you notice
That I'm thinking of a moment
And know its still sound

[Verse 4]
There was a finer life
When you were with us here
And we knew there was a next time
That's what I still want now
Even if I'm there
And I think that you won't be waiting

[Refrain]
Cause I don't want to be alone

[Interlude]
Ahhh...

[Outro]
It's hard where you're living
It's hard where you're living
It's hard where you're living
'Cause I don't want to be alone
No, I don't want to be here alone
Oh...

[Verse 1]
I've lost my temperature
Where have all my sunny days gone? (Gone)
Is there any place to stay warm? (Stay warm)
It's not easy when you're gone (Gone)
Tell me how I'm supposed to go on
Right now I don't wanna be strong

[Pre-Chorus]
With the rain, comes more pain
You never know, damn the weather
Hard to hide, when I cry
This pain inside ain't getting better
Body shakes, I feel so numb (Numb)
I'm shivering, why did you go? (Go)

[Chorus]
My body is froze (Froze, fr-froze)
Every part of me cold
My heart Is aching and I can't breathe (Yeah)
My soul's breaking, minus 31 degrees (Yeah)
Nowhere else to go, froze

[Verse 2]
My heart struggles to beat, yeah, I need a lifeline (Lifelines)
And I would rather die before I
Start to freeze, yeah
Live my life in fear (Live my life in fear), no way

[Pre-Chorus]
With the rain, comes more pain
You never know, damn the weather
Hard to hide, when I cry
This pain inside ain't getting better
Body shakes, I feel so numb (Numb)
I'm shivering, why did you go? (Oh)

[Chorus]
My body is froze, it's froze (Froze, fr-froze)
Every part of me cold (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeha, yeah)
My heart's aching and I can't breathe (Breathe)
My soul's breaking, minus 31 degrees (Degrees)
Nowhere else to go (Go), froze (Froze)

[Bridge]
I am so cold, my body's frozen
I am so cold, frozen
Froze (My body is froze), froze, froze (My body is froze), fr-froze
Cold (My body is froze), cold (My body is froze)
My body is froze (Yeah)
My body is froze (Yeah)
My body is froze (Cold)
My body is froze

[Chorus]
My body is froze (Froze)
Every part of me cold (But there's gotta be a better way, yeah)
My heart's aching and I can't breathe (I can't)
My soul's breaking, minus 31 degrees (31 degrees, yeah)
Nowhere else to go, froze
My body is froze (It is frozen 'cause you're gone, yeah)
Every part of me cold (Ooh-ooh)
My heart's aching and I can't breathe (Can't breathe)
My soul's breaking, minus 31 degrees, (Degrees, yeah)
Nowhere else to go, froze

[Chorus]
There's only one you (You, you, you)
There's only one you (You, you, you)
There's only one you (You, you, you)
Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding

[Verse 1]
Just cause the game is up doesn’t mean I didn’t win
I got three aces and a king
You might have got love from unnatural things
That’s why my instincts kicks in
It doesn't matter if you win it’s based on what you bring
I still feel it and I chase it with a drink
Your telephone rings, but you ain’t listenin'
So motherfucker now I’m steppin’ in

[Chorus]
There's only one you (You, you, you)
There's only one you (You, you, you)
There's only one you (You, you, you)
Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding
There's only one you (You, you, you)

Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding

[Verse 2]
Lara Croft is soft when it comes my stuff
She’s made up, I’m real
I’m a lady of rage, with an afro puff
Who else can say the things they feel?
More jiggy than Will
From a mill to a trill
There’s no beat I cannot kill
Still chill up on a hill
Like I’m poppin’ a pill
There’s no other things I want to feel

[Chorus]
There's only one you (You, you, you)
There's only one you (You, you, you)
There's only one you (You, you, you)
Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding

[Bridge]
There’s trillions of cash
And there’s billions of us
And there’s millions of things that can happen with this stuff
And there’s thousands that will crash
And there’s hundreds that will smash
There’s only one you and I'ma drink to that

[Chorus]
There's only one you (You, you, you)
There's only one you (You, you, you)
There's only one you (You, you, you)
Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding
There's only one you (You, you, you)

[Outro]

Working all day and tonight is gonna be mine
Making money is fine, but your life is one of a kind

Water whippin, water whippin
Flexin like a fish in a bottle in that new thing
50 on my fuckin ring
Tear this, I'm fuckin water whippin
Bitch water whippin
Pussy water whippin
That's me water whippin
What I'm doin?
I got a bad bitch with me as I ride straight got high
Got that hypnotized rules in the trap

[Verse 2:]
Water whippin, water whippin (who?)
Got a ticket (what? Damn)
Call these convicts (where? Fuck em)
On these mid streets
I pull off flexin, take off
Bang 10, drag 10
I got 12 bad bitches and I'm switchin 30 racks
In the kitches they be kissin
My diamond glisten
My diamond glisten
Scarface mansions, I'm water whippin
Feeling good, I'm gone
On the hood, took off
Me is rich, let's get that understood, Soulja

[Bridge:]
I'm water whippin, water whippin
Keep them bricks, keep them bricks
Nigga took me swimming, you ain't shit
Pussy nigga, pussy
You will fetch this gold bracelet on my wrist
I be fuckin the red bottoms Versace kicks

[Hook:]
Water whippin, water whippin
Water whippin, water whippin
Water whippin, water whippin
Water whippin, water whippin
I got 200 bands on me right now
When I walk inside the club, how knows?
I'm rockin wild

Water whippin, water whippin
Water whippin, water whippin
Got them brand new Jordans on my feet, I'm a big dog
Step inside the club
Bitch poppin just like real, Soulja

[Chorus]
Lay down your weary tune, lay down
Lay down the song you strum
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
No voice can hope to hum

[Verse 1]
Struck by the sounds before the sun
I knew the night had gone
The morning breeze like a bugle blew
Against the drums of dawn

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
The ocean wild like an organ played
The seaweed's wove its strands
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed
Against the rocks and sands

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I stood unwound beneath the skies
And clouds unbound by laws
The crying rain like a trumpet sang
And asked for no applause

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
The last of leaves fell from the trees
And clung to a new love's breast
The branches bare like a banjo played
To the winds that listened best

I gazed down in the river's mirror
And watched its winding strum
The water smooth ran like a hymn
And like a harp did hum

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I used to be a rollin' stone, you know
If a cause was right
I'd leave to find the answer on the road
I used to be a heart beatin' for someone
But the times have changed
The less I say, the more my work gets done

[Chorus]
'Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born, I've waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom took me knee--high to a man, yeah
Gave me peace of mind my daddy never had

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, Philadelphia freedom, shine on me, I love ya
Shine the light through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light, shine the light
Shine the light, won't you shine the light?
Philadelphia freedom, I lo-o-ove ya
Yes, I do

[Verse 2]
If you choose to, you can live your life alone
Some people choose the city (Some people choose the city)
Some others choose the good old family home
(Some others choose the good old family home)
I like livin' easy without family ties ('Livin easy)
Til the whippoorwill of freedom zapped me
Right between the eyes

[Chorus]
'Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born, I've waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom took me knee-high to a man
Gave me peace of mind my daddy never had

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, Philadelphia freedom, shine on me, I love ya
Shine the light through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light, shine the light
Shine the light, won't you shine the light?
Philadelphia freedom, I lo-o-ove ya, yes I do

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, Philadelphia freedom, shine on me
I love ya
Shine the light through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light, shine the light
Shine the light, won't you shine the light?
Philadelphia freedom, I lo-o-ove ya
You know I lo-o-ove ya, yeah
You know I lo-o-ove you, yes I do!

[Outro]
(Philadelphia freedom)
I lo-o-ove you, yes I do, Philadelphia freedom
You know that I lo-o-ove you, yes I do!
(Philadelphia freedom)
Oh, don't you know that I lo-o-ove you, yes I do!
(Philadelphia freedom)
Don't you know that I lo-o-ove you, yes I do!
(Philadelphia freedom)
Don't you know that I lo-o-ove you, yes I do!

[Verse 1]
Lightning strike
Inside my chest to keep me up at night
Dream of ways
To make you understand my pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare

[Chorus]
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?

[Verse 2]
Drop his name
Push it in and twist the knife again
Watch my face
As I pretend to feel no pain, pain, pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare

[Chorus]
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
Just say so

[Bridge]
How come the only way to know how high you get me
Is to see how far I fall?
God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me
But I can't break through it all
It's a heart, heartbreak

[Verse 3]
I don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight
Let's just fix this whole thing now
I swear to God we're gonna get it right
If you lay your weapon down

[Chorus]
Red wine and Ambien
You're talking shit again
It's heartbreak warfare
Good to know it's all a game
Disappointment has a name
It's heartbreak, heartbreak

[Outro]
It's heartbreak warfare
It's heartbreak warfare
It's heartbreak warfare

[Verse 1]
Just when I had you off my head
Your voice comes thrashing wildly through my quiet bed
You say you want to try again
But I've tried everything but giving in

[Pre-Chorus]
Why do you want to break my heart again?
Why am I going to let you try when

[Chorus]
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye

[Verse 2]
I bought a ticket on a plane
And by the time it landed, you were gone again
I love you more than songs can say
But I can't keep running after yesterday, so

[Pre-Chorus]
Why do you want to break my heart again?
Why am I going to let you try when

[Chorus]
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye

[Bridge]
We say goodbye
We say goodbye
We say goodbye

[Chorus]
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye

[Verse 1: John Mayer]
I was born in the arms of imaginary friends
Free to roam, made a home out of everywhere I've been
Then you come crashing in, like the realest thing
Trying my best to understand all that your love can bring

[Chorus 1: John Mayer & Taylor Swift]
Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

[Verse 2: John Mayer]
I was made to believe I'd never love somebody else
Made a plan, stay the man who can only love himself
Lonely was the song I sang, until the day you came
Showing me another way and all that my love can bring

[Chorus 1: John Mayer & Taylor Swift]
Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

[Verse 3: John Mayer]
Your faith is strong
But I can only fall short for so long
Down the road, later on
You will hate that I never gave more to you than half of my heart
But I can't stop loving you

[Backup Vocals: Taylor Swift]
I can't stop loving you

But I can't stop loving you with half of my
Half of my heart
Half of my heart

[Chorus 2: John Mayer & Taylor Swift]
Half of my heart’s got a real cool imagination
Half of my heart’s got you
Half of my heart’s got the right mind to tell you
Half of my heart won’t do

[Outro: John Mayer ]
Half of my heart is a shotgun wedding to a bride with a paper ring
And half of my heart is the part of a man who's never truly loved anything
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart

[Verse 1]
Who says I can’t get stoned?
Turn off the lights and the telephone
Me, in my house alone
Who says I can’t get stoned?

Who says I can’t be free?
From all of the things that I used to be
Re-write my history
Who says I can’t be free?

[Chorus]
It’s been a long night in New York City
It’s been a long night in Baton Rouge
I don’t remember you looking any better
But then again, I don’t remember you

[Verse 2]
Who says I can’t get stoned?
Call up a girl that I used to know
Fake love for an hour or so
Who says I can’t get stoned?
Who says I can’t take time?
Meet all the girls on the county line
Wait on fate to send a sign
Who says I can’t take time?

[Chorus]
It’s been a long night in New York City
It’s been a long night in Austin too
I don’t remember you looking any better
But then again, I don’t remember you

[Verse 3]
Who says I can’t get stoned?
Plan a trip to Japan alone
Doesn’t matter if I even go
Who says I can’t get stoned?

[Chorus]
It’s been a long night in New York City
It’s been a long time since 22
I don’t remember you looking any better
But then again I don’t remember, don't remember you

[Verse 1]
Had a little love, but I spread it thin
Falling in her arms and out again
Made a bad name for my game around town
Tore up my heart, and shut it down

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing to do
Nowhere to be
A simple little kind of free
Nothing to do
No one but me
And that's all I need

[Chorus]
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely (Yeah)
Because I don't belong to anyone
Nobody belongs to me

[Verse 2]
I see friends around from time to time
When their ladies let them slip away
And when they ask me how I'm doing with mine
This is always what I say

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing to do
Nowhere to be
A simple little kind of free
Nothing to do
No one but me
And that's all I need

[Chorus]
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely (Yeah)
Because I don't belong to anyone
Nobody belongs to me

[Verse 3]
And this is not to say
There never comes a day
I'll take my chances and start again
And when I look behind
On all my younger times
I have to thank the wrongs that led me to a love so strong

[Chorus]
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely (Yeah)
Cause I don't belong to anyone
Nobody belongs to me

That's the way, that's the way, that's the way that I want it
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way that I want it
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way that I want it
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way that I want it

[Intro]
You can whistle for it

[Verse 1]
Baby, you'll never grow old in my eyes
With your golden grill, true love never dies
You wanna watch me while I watch TV
While you're t-t-t-t-touching me
We're forever young in paradise
As long as you got the Chevrolet, I will ride

[Pre-Chorus]
We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in that Chevrolet from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Every man deserves to see the sunrise

[Chorus]
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine?

[Verse 2]
You said I'd never make it out outta here alive
At the rate I was going, I'd be lucky to die
I was born so bad, not naturally right
The brightest star on Hollywood and Vine

[Pre-Chorus]
We're gonna party like we're running outta time
We're getting drunk and driving fast on cherry wine
Never do belong to anyone I find
Leaving everything I ever knew behind

[Chorus]
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine?

[Chorus - Variation]
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
Promised me this
Well, you lied

[Bridge]
I learned how to make love from the movies
He found me waitressing at Ruby Tuesday's
He said I wanna buy you a classic white milkshake
I said I'll serve you up a special side of heartbreak
Special side of heartbreak
I was working down in the corner cafe
You drove by in a Chevrolet
Whistle at me as my hips go sway
Lana Del Rey, how you get that way?
How you get that way?
I said "He loves my heart shaped sunglasses
He loves the heart shape my ass is
Cristal, crystal champagne glasses"

[Chorus]
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine?

[Chorus - Variation]
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
Promised me this
Well, you lied

[Chorus: Jamie Drastik]
Sooner or later that spark just disappears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Every time one of us ending up in tears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Is it good that we hurt every day?
It this worth all the pain that we feel inside?
Am I too blind to see this is happening to me?
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I live the fast life, going nowhere fast
I seen my past life and politely passed
But I’m already planning on doin' it big
For my life after death and live my life after death
Baby, what you think all the training is for?
Just to properly prepare you for war
So I keep you on your toes
If you look out for them friends that are really foes
This career tried to swallow us (Swallow us)
Paparazzi tried to follow us (Follow us)
I’m everything my momma was
Rider, survivor, a motherfuckin fighter
Thank god for this rapping shit (Thank you)
Forget the cash it's about happiness
Normal life that’s for the birds
I work hard so you never say these words

[Chorus: Jamie Drastik]
Sooner or later that spark just disappears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Every time one of us ending up in tears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Is it good that we hurt every day?
It this worth all the pain that we feel inside?
Am I too blind to see this is happening to me?
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
The critics goin' nowhere (Nowhere)
Thinking that they know me like the Bible, oh hell no
But they don’t understand me all well
Snitching is a sport now, so please, do tell
The world I raise hell
Yeah, I did the crime, but I skip jail
I’m just trying to own teams, get it player
And dance on the globe like Fred Astaire
The world is ours, baby
It’s just waiting for us so don’t be late (Late)
And we can both aim for the sky
And shoot for the stars and call it a date
Now you know that I know that we know
If the world wants war, cock back and reload
A normal life, that’s for the birds
I work hard, so you never say these words

[Chorus: Jamie Drastik]
Sooner or later that spark just disappears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Every time one of us ending up in tears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Is it good that we hurt every day?
It this worth all the pain that we feel inside?
Am I too blind to see this is happening to me?
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere

[Verse 1]
I don't care what nobody says
We're gonna have a baby
Taking off in a Coupe de Ville
She's buckled up on navy
She don't care what her momma says
No, she gonna have my baby
Taking all that I have to take
This takings gonna shake me

[Refrain]
People call us renegades
'Cause we like living crazy
We like taking on the town
'Cause people's getting lazy

I don't care what nobody says
No, I'm gonna be her lover
Always mad and usually drunk
But I love her like no other

[Chorus 1]
And the doctor seems to say he don't know
Where we're going to go
I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go

[Refrain]
People call us renegades
'Cause we like living crazy
We like taking on the town
'Cause people's getting lazy

I don't care what nobody says
No, I'm gonna be her lover
Always mad and usually drunk
But I love her like no other

[Chorus 2]
And her daddy he says he don't know
Where we're going to go
I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go

[Intersection]
People call us renegades
(woo ohh ohh ohh)
We like taking on the town
(woo ohh ohh ohh)
I don't care if you don't care
(woo ohh ohh ohh)

[Verse 3]
I don't care what nobody says
We're gonna have a baby
Takin off in a Coupe de Ville
She's buckled up on navy
She don't care what her momma says
No, she gonna have my baby
I'm takin' all I have to take
This takings gonna shape me
(woo ohh ohh ohh)
(woo ohh ohh ohh)

I’m so tangy, people call me Matangi
Goddess of word, bitches I’mma keep it banging
Truth is like a rotten tooth, you gotta spit it out!
Let the bottom two, let my wisdom work it out
Big on the underground, can’t knock me down
Vicki Leekx bitches, better buy it on demand
I sleep in my tent and then I stand by it too
I can say lots with a little words or few like
Adam had 'em, yeah, me, the madame
I’ll introduce you to the d-d-dem-dems
Come let me go, do you like my perfume?
Made it at home with some gasoline and shrooms
Oil and water are two extremes
We like fucking carpets, you like fucking brooms
Why is your tattoo some ugly looking thing?
I got many designs they're learning on Bing
My cousin got his DCS he's decorating
He’s handy you might need him when I'm finishing what I’m saying
Just be frank, you my stan, I'm your stan
I don’t care what you smell what's you fucking joint
A lot to be pissed and made to be yanks
'Cause it’s not me and you, it's the fucking banks!

[Pre-Chorus]

Let the bottom two, let my wisdom work it out
The world is ours, sending your sordid powers
The words announced, hope you heard em like cows
Alpha kenny body, Roger, Charlie and Rich
Bitch, my swag, bitches can’t touch this
So click, click, click, please get off my dick
Just ‘cause I’m a mom it don’t make me thick
I'm a overweight, heavyweight, female Slick Rick
If you need the cheese then my shit cost stake

My Nan was a stan for imported liquor brands
72 bottles at her birthday got drank
I must say people I got her to freaking thank
I'm a party fuckin' animal, if you ain't scram
Party fuckin' animal, if you ain't scram
Party fuckin' animal, if you ain't scram
P-p-p-party fuckin' animal, if you ain't scram
P-p-party fuckin' animal, if you ain't scram
My uncle jumped a boat it took him to Iran
It started as a life now it got him banned
I came in a hurry not a white van
Learnt that Sam, Ram, and Chan are same man
Corrugated iron wooded shacks
Gated mansions next to execs
Boys on motor bikes next to Maybachs
We got back packs next to cats from kysaks
Ex convicts are diplomats
We got rappers and russians who don't pay tax
These cards are stacked and this our crack
Rewind pull it now bring it all back
Rewind pull it now bring it all back
Rewind pull it now bring it all back

[Pre-Chorus]

[Intro: Big Sean]
I done fell asleep fucking last night
That’s how much I don’t sleep nigga
Let me get a little
Finally famous nigga

[Hook: Big Sean]
And I’ll be goddamned if I didn’t
Put the city on let’s get it

And I’ll be goddamned if I didn’t
Put the city on let’s get it
(alright alright alright, alright alright alright)
Let’s get it

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Today is a good day
I wish a nigga would day
Ride through the hood day
Ride through the hood where I would stay
If I wasn’t me, wasn’t committed
I told my mom and my dad it’ll be the last Christmas
In the hood that you can visit
Oh boy I got it, no chasers
Cause the best mixed with Hennessey is problems
I took that advice young when I was headed up to college
Momma swimming in that debt
Rather swim with the piranhas or the shark
Ready set go, on your mark to the top
Getting rich ain’t a blessing it’s a choice
Drunk and still drinking out the fucking bottle
I want a hood rat bitch motherfuck a model
You ain't alive if you ain't living that’s the motto
And imma’ probably wake up tomorrow sayin, sayin

[Hook: Big Sean]
And I’ll be goddamned if I didn’t
Put the city on let’s get it
(alright alright alright, alright alright alright)
Let’s get it
And I’ll be goddamned if I didn’t
Put the city on let’s get it
(alright alright alright, alright alright alright)
Let’s get it

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Lets get it, yeah be alright nigga
It’s the motherfucking world nigga
Getcha some time to just do it how I done it
First up on the first cause’ first of all you gotta want it
Re-up time for every penny, never fronted
Showroom floor, paid every penny then I stunted
Stunted so hard you woulda thought I was a stuntman
TS4 with 23’s I’m talking jumpmans
Twos and thirds watch for the blitz, you know they rush
Just don’t get caught in the coupe with them birds, end of discussion
Them boys round the corner wanna sell in that Cal Ripken
If them niggas think I’m riding with that, them niggas tripping
Yeah I got a magnificent hustle, cause’ imma’ grinder
Told my O's, "I'm hiding you here, so they won’t find you"
What you know about a bag that’s heavy as anacondas?
Bet you one thing, I ain’t talking no marijuana
That’s whats wrong with these niggas they think it’s about shine
You niggas get back to your grind, I think it’s about time

[Hook: Big Sean]
And I’ll be goddamned if I didn’t
Put the city on let’s get it
(alright alright alright, alright alright alright)
Let’s get it
And I’ll be goddamned if I didn’t
Put the city on let’s get it
(alright alright alright, alright alright alright)
Let’s get it

[Verse 3: Payroll]
They say it’s my time according to my Rolex
I’m bout to fuck the game, then your ho next
I used to talk dirty on my cell, no phone sex
No yoga boy I was making blow stretch
Press the fast forward button, I’m pushing a foreign something
All through my neighborhood, next stop is the haters hood
My bitch so bad, but you can bet that my paper good
I do this for real, you lil niggas just fake it good
It’s time for a new crib, it’s time for a new chain
20 thousand on me homie that’s just loose change
Too many diamond chains that nigga a mess
But if you knew bout my hood you’d say that nigga is blessed
Detroit in this bitch, Big Sean what it do bro?
Getting money four ways so I can buy a two-door
Stash looking healthy but my jewelry got the flu though
The hustle’s who I represent, Dough Boyz we in this bitch

[Hook: Big Sean]
And I’ll be goddamned if I didn’t
Put the city on let’s get it
(alright alright alright, alright alright alright)
Let’s get it
And I’ll be goddamned if I didn’t
Put the city on let’s get it
(alright alright alright, alright alright alright)
Let’s get it

[Outro: Lawrence Lamont]
Detroit, once the backbone of this country
Now it’s the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy
Thriving neighborhoods are now vacant
Going from a population of nearly 2 million
To under 700,000 in a matter of years
The people of Detroit really going to have to stick together
To make it through these tough times

[Intro:]
Oh, oh, ooh
You are my
You know you my sensational, sensational girl
Sensational, sensational girl
Sensational, sensational girl

[Verse 1:]
Oh I love your love

But they don’t compare to you

[Pre-Hook:]
Your kiss, your lips taste sweet as honey, darling
I just lose myself inside of you
Touch me, hold me, need me, keep me
Swear you’ll never leave me
And you’ll always be my

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]

Cause you know what to do to get me in the mood

[Pre-Hook:]
Your kiss, your lips taste sweet as honey, darling
I just lose myself inside of you, you
Touch me, hold me, need me, keep me
Swear you’ll never leave me

Light light you up no candle
Grip on that handle Yosemite Sam ya, that bitch bang like a banjo
Told my arms dealer no need for a box, I don't read the instructions, I throw out the manual (WOO!)
Versace, Versace, my brother king Trell he in a Ferrari
I don't look the same, my camera the same, I made too much money (WOO!)
Paul Pierce is my neighbor, I told him he should of went to the Clippers
I got some crazy ideas for Versace, get them and tell'em my number
Versace, auggh Picasso, Basquiat I'm cocky

I don't fuck with Saddam but, that's gold all in my toilet
Statues of Horus, and Anubis is polished
I don't got to, rap about, coke for you to enjoy it
I'm bout' to join the money team, just holla' to Floyd about it

[G] Eminem as Susan (the girl)

[D] Eminem as Dave

[J] Eminem as John

[R] Eminem as Ron

[Chorus]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Verse 1]
I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and *tied* up
With first aid tape and *raped* on the first date
Susan -- an ex-manic depressive who just moved from Houston
Who loves blues and alternative music (Whattup?)
Told me she was starvin, I said it wasn't a problem (Nah!)
I got a coupon for this pizza with everything on it
We can double the mushrooms and minus the sausage

[G] I'm allergic to fungus
Come on Sue, that's nonsense
Who's at the door? Pizza man!
Who ordered pizza? Susan, it's yours

[G] Nuh uh
If you got it with double mushrooms on it then I don't want it
Shutup Susan I'll pick em off it
Oh hell, I might as well try it, I'll be alright
Susan you just swallowed the wrong slice!!

[Chorus]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (I'm sorry)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Verse 2]
"Yo Sue!"

[G] Get away from me, I don't know you
Oh shoot, she's tripping..

[G] I need to go puke!! (Bleahh!)
I wasn't tryin to turn this into somethin major
I just wanted to make you appreciate flavor
Susan, stop cryin, I don't hate ya
I'm sorry your father used to chase ya and spank ya with hangers
So what they locked you in the attic in your dad's house?
That ain't no reason to start wiggin and spaz out
She said

[G] Help me I think I'm havin a seizure!
I said, "You're breaking out in hives, let go of the pizza!"
"Would you put it down you're startin to scare me"
She said

[G] I'm twenty-six years old and I'm not married
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook
(Hello!) I'm over here Sue, (hi) you're talkin to the plant, look!
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late
'Cause I never seen no-one eat as many *shrooms* as you ate

[Chorus]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl (Whoops)
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (It's an accident)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Verse 3]
Susan (wait!) Where you goin? You better be careful

[G] Leave me alone dad, I'm sick of gettin my hair pulled
I'm not your dad, quit tryin to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? Put down the scissors, 'fore you do somethin dumb
I'll be right back just chill baby please?
I gotta go find Dave he majored in allergies
"John, where's Dave at before I bash you?"

[J] He's in the bathroom; I think he's takin a crap dude!
"Dave! Pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talkin to plants
Choppin her hair off, and there's only two days left
Of Spring Break, how long do these things take to wear off?"

[D] Well it depends on how many pieces she ate
Just one, with double mushrooms by mistake
Now she's upstairs cryin out her eyeballs, breaking out in hives"

[D] She's gonna die dude
"I know and it's my fault!"

[D] My god!!!

[Chorus]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world (I'm sorry)
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (What do I do?)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Outro]
My God, I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry! Susan please wake up!
Please! Please wake up!! What are you doing?!
You're not dead!! You're NOT dead!
I know you're not dead!

[Verse 1]
Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, and the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're all right
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

[Verse 2]
I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're all right
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

[Bridge]
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side

[Outro]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?

[Intro]
Alright
Now dig this, baby

[Verse 1]
You don't care for me
I don't care about that
You got a new fool, ha!
I like it like that
I have only one burning desire
Let me stand next to your fire

[Chorus]
Let me stand next to your fire (Hey! Let me stand next to your fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Whoa, let me stand baby)
Let me stand next to your fire (Let me stand)
Let me stand next to your fire (Yeah baby)

[Verse 2]
Listen here, baby
And stop acting so crazy
You say your mom ain't home
It ain't my concern
Just play with me and you won't get burned
I have only one itching desire
Let me stand next to your fire

[Chorus]
Let me stand next to your fire (Yeah! Let me stand baby)
Let me stand next to your fire (Let me stand)
Let me stand next to your fire (Oh, let me stand)
Let me stand next to your fire (Oh!)

[Bridge]
Oh! Move over, Rover
And let Jimi take over
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about
Yeah, get on with it, baby

[Guitar solo]
Yeah
That's what I'm talking about
Now dig this!
Ha!

[Verse 3]
Now listen, baby
You try to give me your money
You better save it, babe
Save it for your rainy day
I have only one burning desire
Let me stand next to your fire

[Chorus]
Let me stand next to your fire (Oh! Let me stand)
Let me stand next to your fire (Let me stand)
Let me stand next to your fire (I ain't gonna do you no harm)
Let me stand next to your fire

[Outro]
Ow, yeah, you better move over baby
I ain't gonna hurt ya baby
Ah, I ain't talkin' with your old lady
Ow, ah yes this is Jimi talkin' to you
Yeah, baby, dooo

[Intro]
Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy
Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy
Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy
Ayy-ayy, ah-ah
Ayy-ayy, ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1]
Damn, I want my baby back
It's so cold without her
Cold without her, she's gone
Now I'm alone, no one to hold on
'Cause she was the only one
And I know I was dead wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you-u-u, if you-u-u
See her soo-oo-oon
Ask her will she forgive me, yeah

[Chorus]
If you ever see her (Oh-oh-oh-oh), if you ever meet her (Oh-oh)
If you ever get a chance to sit down and talk to her (Woah, oh)
Let her know it's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold here without her
And tell her I miss her, tell her I need her
Tell her I want her, I really want her
To come back home, back to keep me warm
Tell her I'm sorry, I'm really sorry
Can you forgive me? Please forgive me
And come back home, keep me safe and warm

[Verse 2]
Woah, oh
Damn, my baby's really gone
I don't know if she's coming home
My luck's up, I-I-I-I know
Tell me what to do to get her back, oh
Back where her heart belongs
Been gone from me too long

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you-u-u, see my boo-oo-oo
Please can you-u-u
Can you tell her for me?

[Chorus]
If you ever see her (Oh) if you ever meet her (Oh, yeah)
If you ever get a chance to sit down and talk to her
Let her know it's so cold (Let her know it's so cold), it's so cold (Let her know it's so cold)
It's so cold here without her
And tell her I miss her, tell her I need her
Tell her I want her, I really want her
To come back home, back to keep me warm
Tell her I'm sorry, I'm really sorry
Can you forgive me? Please forgive me
And come back home, keep me safe and warm (Yeah!)

[Bridge]
All dem gyal across the world (Say what?)
You know you gotta be my girl (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
All dem gyal across the world (Chris Brown, let's go)
You know you gotta be my girl (Ladies)
All dem gyal across the world (Hey, hey, ayy-ayy)
You know you gotta be my girl (Hey, hey, hey, hey, ayy-ayy)
All dem gyal across the world (Ayy-ayy, ah-ah)

[Chorus]
If you ever see her, if you ever meet her
If you ever get a chance to sit down and talk to her
Let her know it's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold here without her

[Verse 1]
Mad sounds in your ears
Make you feel alright
They bring you back to life

Mad sounds in your ears
Make you get up and dance
Make you get up
Yeah, they make you get up

Love buckles under the strain
Of those wild nights
Run but you cannot hide

[Chorus]
Mad sounds, in your ears
Make you get up and dance
Make you get up
All night long they reappear
Make you get up and dance
Yeah, they make you get up

[Verse 2]
Suppose you've gotta do what you've gotta do
We just weren't feeling how we wanted to
You sit and try sometimes
But you just can’t figure out what went wrong
Then out of nowhere, somebody comes and hits you with an

[Bridge]
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh

[Chorus]
You got those mad sounds, in your ears
To make you get up and dance
Mad sounds, in your ears
They make you get up and dance
Hold on to make you get up
Ah yeah, they make you get up

[Outro]
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh

[Hook]
The realest shit I ever wrote in my life, in my life, in my life
In my life, in my life, in my life, in my life
The realest shit I ever wrote in my life, in my life, in my life
In my life, in my life, in my life, in my life
In my life, my life, my life...

[Verse 1]
Time and time again, I ask myself "who's listening?"
Who feels my pain, who feels my thoughts?
Who's on the road that I'm traveling?
But I can't complain, these are just my words
You would feel the same if you was in my skin, if you was in my shoes
If you went all the days that I went struggling and hustling
If you spent all the nights that my momma cried
Those endless nights, those weary eyes
Everyone in the house would just fuss and fight
Flipping over furniture, grabbing knives
We'd call the cops, here they come again
All the things in life I couldn't comprehend
We ignored our problems, we'd just pretend
That they wasn't there, like they didn't exist
In Eastside Decatur our situation made us
React the the way that we did
All the nights that we had to freeze
"Oh no, huddle up, here comes the wind!"
On a stormy night in a flooded house
I can still hear the raindrops pourin' in...
And they pourin' in, it's pourin' in
I can still hear the raindrops pourin' in...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
That's why my attitude is "fuck the world"
I see most these rappers as a bunch of girls
Scary-ass niggas, this a poltergeist
Kick these niggas offstage like an open mic
Niggas know who I am behind the music
Even when they gon', I'mma still be here
I done made more money off a single album
Then you'll probably ever see throughout your whole career
Y'all ain't boss, y'all lightweight
We smoke pounds, y'all pound cake
That's why real niggas don't fuck with y'all
Y'all sweet to the air like soundscapes
And the crazy thing about it - I ain't gotta do this rap shit
I could make a million off of royalties
And turn around and buy the rights to your masters
I ain't gotta feel the fake persona
Full of goons in my squad who appear to be bolder
I'm from the 'hood, man, I ain't from the streets
I took a different path, the one that lasted longer
And now I'm straight for life, and my team is eatin'
And that's all I owe, and that's the way I see it
So leave me the fuck alone
And let me smoke this blunt to myself this evening

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
What am I supposed to be?
Am I supposed to smile, am I supposed to grin, huh?
For White America to let me in
Should I assume a role that's none threatening?
"Oh, Bobby Ray, you so cool in your raps"
"All that other garbage, you don't talk like that"
Meanwhile, I just left the strip club an hour ago
Now I'm thinkin' 'bout turning back
Tell me who's the author that writes the script
I'm what it means to be, to be a lyricist
Obviously, I'm in a league of my own
So I don't get offended if I ain't on your list
This takes me back, back in the day
...when I was broke as shit
Failed every test, every class I skipped
I was in my zone with a pad and pen
I didn't understand, I was just a kid
So misunderstood, never had a friend
I was so depressed, always upset
Here I go, contemplating suicide again
I was all alone, I was out of touch
Little did I know that I was out of sight
So I kept my headphones all the way turnt up
Waiting for the moment when the time was right
Now the time is right...

[Hook]

Uh, can't wait to get home
Baby, dial your number
Can you pick up the phone?
'Cause I wanna holla
Daydreaming 'bout you all day in school, can't concentrate
Wanna have your voice in my ear
'Til mama come and says it's too late

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the lights are on outside
Wish there was somewhere to hide
'Cause I just don't want to say goodbye
'Cause you are my baby, baby

[Chorus]
Nothing really matters
I don't really care
What nobody tell me
I'm gonna be here
It's a matter of extreme importance
My first teenage love affair

[Verse 2]
Another secret meeting
On the fifth floor stair case
I'm gonna give you this letter
Of all the things I can't say
Want you to be my first, my last, my ending and beginning, yeah
I wrote your name in my book
Your last name, my first
I'm your Mrs

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the lights are on outside
Wish there was somewhere to hide
I just don't want to say goodbye
'Cause you are my baby, baby

[Chorus]
Nothing really matters
I don't really care
What nobody tell me
I'm gonna be here
It's a matter of extreme importance
My first teenage love affair

[Interlude]
Hey, boy
You know I really like being with you, right?
Just hanging out is fun

[Bridge]
So maybe we can go to first base
Because I feel you
Second base
Want you to feel me too
Third base
Better pump the breaks
Well baby, slow down
I gotta go home now

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the lights are on outside (Outside)
Wish there was somewhere to hide (To hide)
'Cause I just don't want to say goodbye
'Cause you are my baby, baby

[Chorus]
Nothing really matters
I don't really care
What nobody tell me
I'm gonna be here
It's a matter of extreme importance
My first teenage love affair
My baby, baby
Nothing really matters
I don't really care
What nobody tell me
I'm gonna be here
It's a matter of extreme importance
My first teenage love affair
I’ve been meaning to write you more. different hotels every night aren’t so bad really. in fact- all the moving house could inspire a photo series.. not for the gram, knowing me it’s probably only for whoever controls my estate in the future and enthusiastically develops all the rolls of film i forgot to. i’m in belgium, just 7 concerts into a tour with an ambiguous ending. i’d tour for a year if it didn’t interrupt my recording or my weekend driving. i really wanted to go to cairo in between europe and australia.. might let things settle some.. go to south africa instead and place some flowers on a gate for the president.for being epic and 94. i write on paper at night. my tour manager gave me a small powder blue book at the beginning of this run with gold embossed lettering on the cover that reads ‘one line a day’.. it’s easier than you’d think to narrow the entire cinema of your day into one sentence. i never read them back in the morning. whenever morning is.. even my macbook clock can’t keep up. all the travel isn’t in support of an album or anything like that really- past or ahead. there’s no label or touring firm dollars involved. all pennies from my pocket. in support of some odd daydream. ops to photograph crowds and clouds from planes. contrast all the quiet with some noise. new noise and old noise..sober crowd, faaded crowd. all welcome.
desensitized eyes on this body i am…in this mirror i am. i got ostracized and didn’t notice till i closed my eyes last a.m. didn’t see. i need a point to keep these eyes in focus. i need my eyes to be quicker than your hands. they aren’t and won’t ever be- so when you do magic i won’t watch. see, my eyes have an ego. i need these eyes like..i need the holes in my head. i always find something off, like a hairline. symmetry gives me boner, it isn’t boring at all. my eyes don’t bore me at all. neither do yours. i never saw you fuck, except that one time? i still get off to the residue that the image left behind. what i see inside my mind now isn’t technically with my eyes. i heard about a third, but i’ll believe it when i see it blink on my forehead. big head. five head. eye don’t know. eyes just talking.

[Hook: DMX]
Ya'll don't really know, they don't really know (Yeah!)
Ya'll don't really know, they don't really know (Yeah!)
Ya'll don't really know, they don't really know (Yeah!)
Ya'll don't really know, they don't really know (Check it)

[Verse 1: DMX]
Sky's the limit so I'm reaching for the stars
I'm tired of being the nigga that they keep behind bars
What's good? You got it, I'mma take yours
I'm hood; fuck a gun, I break jaws!
Understood disturbing the bang for the cause
And I should cause you frontin' bang with the fours
Rats playing in the walls, cats playing in the halls
But niggas know after certain hours stay in doors
Cause I'm not responsible for what I might do
Or what might happen if dog come through
It's gonna be a problem
'Cause man if I catch em, I'ma rob em
"Please, somebody stop him!"
Well for that, it's too late
I got to eat, you ate
You straight and I ain't gonna take it all today
You can say what you want but Ya'll know the truth
X is a beast in the streets and the booth (Nigga!)

[Hook:DMX]
Ya'll don't really know, they don't really know (Yeah!)
Ya'll don't really know, they don't really know (Yeah!)
Ya'll don't really know, they don't really know (Yeah!)
Ya'll don't really know, they don't really know

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
See, know-it-all rinky-dink Mr. Softy Rapper, I'm here to kill it!
I reinstate the boom POW! I make you niggas feel IT!
And most these niggas fear it and pop it off and blam it
And how we smash it out like you watching Animal
Planet (What?!)
Now let us unload the bricks off, niggas is pissed off
The stage too crowded to throw the bitch off
I'm about to turn the switch off
To the goons at hand, pick em
And then (Brrrrt Ohh) stick em (Hahaha!), stick 'em! (Woah)
You better chuck in your shine and prime grime
And niggas is back, we kill em in black, now feel us one time
See how we got 'em following suit, forming one line
Until we force these niggas to scatter soon as I bust mine
Bust Rhymes, constantly fulfilling em with heat
Like an oil spill in the street
See how we killing em
Peep at how we drill em in the head with a caseload
And bang em (They don't really know)
Hang 'em!

[Hook: DMX]
Ya'll don't really know, they don't really know (Yeah!)
Ya'll don't really know, they don't really know (Yeah!)
Ya'll don't really know, they don't really know (Yeah!)
Ya'll don't really know, they don't really know

[Verse 3: DMX]
Beasts on the track like Wolverine
I'm a pit bull but get wolves on them Team
It ain't what it seems, don't get it twisted
Ima let you know just in case ya'll missed it
Got me fucked up, if you thought that I fell off
Now niggas want to ride dick get the hell off
Come on Chulo, we both know you culo
I know, you know that your the one who knows
Beef it for real, nigga, I sleep with the steal
I keep my shit real, I keep shit still
Ain't nothing change but the date and the year
Niggas make threats yet they wait for a year (Come on!)

[Hook: DMX]
Ya'll don't really know, they don't really know (Yeah!)
Ya'll don't really know, they don't really know (Yeah!)
Ya'll don't really know, they don't really know (Yeah!)
Ya'll don't really know, they don't really know

[Verse 1]
Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be? You're not here with me
You never said goodbye, someone tell me, why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself, "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

[Post-Chorus]
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

[Verse 2]
Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand, then forever can begin

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself, "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

[Bridge]
Oh, whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
That you are not alone, I am here with you
(You are not alone, I am here with you)
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
(Though you're far away, you and me)
But you are not alone, I am here with you
(You are always in my heart)
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone (Not alone, oh)

[Outro]
You are not alone, you are not alone
Say it again
You are not alone, you are not alone
Not alone, not alone
If you just reach out for me, girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone
You and me, not alone, oh!
Together, together
Not not being alone!
Not not being alone!
You believe in me!

[Verse 1]
My friends say I'm a fool to think that you're the one for me
I guess I'm just a sucker for love
'Cause honestly the truth is that you know I'm never leaving
'Cause you're my angel sent from above

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby you can do no wrong, my money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong, just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above ya, above ya

[Chorus]
Love me, love me, say that you love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me
Love me, love me, say that ya love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me

[Verse 2]
People try to tell me but I still refuse to listen
'Cause they don't get to spend time with you
A minute with you is worth more than
A thousand days without your love, oh your love

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby you can do no wrong, my money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong, just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above ya, above ya

[Chorus]
Love me, love me, say that you love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me
Love me, love me, say that ya love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me

[Bridge]
My heart is blind but I don't care
'Cause when I'm with you everything has disappeared
And every time I hold ya near
I never want to let ya go, oh

[Chorus]
Love me, love me, say that you love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me
Love me, love me, say that ya love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me

[Verse 1]
I can't remember when you looked at me and cried
Said something broke inside of you
Were my best friend
Whatever come our way, you know I'm your girl 'til the end

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I'll finally go away
I know you'll look for me one day

[Chorus]
When you let love down
Oh, you let love down
I don't have to remind you, but you know that I'm around
When you let love down
Oh, you let me down
Get a little let down
Let it down

[Verse 2]
I can't remember when you put your hand on mine
But couldn't play in time
When we, yeah, when we're not together
Just sing a little song
Blueberry kisses forever

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, when I'll finally go away (when I'll finally go away)
I know you'll look for me one day
Oh, yeah
It's so sad

[Chorus]
When you let love down
Oh, you let love down
I don't have to remind you, but you know that I'm around
When you let love down
Oh, you let me down
Get a little love down
Let it down

[Bridge]
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't let me down
Oh, don't let me down
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
When you let love down
Oh, you let love down
I don't have to remind you, but you know that I'm around
When you let love down
Oh, you let me down

[Outro]
Don't let me down
Let it down
Can't let love down
Let it down
Can't let love down
Let it down

[Verse 1]
I am driving up '85 in the
Kind of morning that lasts all afternoon
Just stuck inside the gloom
4 more exits to my apartment but
I am tempted to keep the car in drive
And leave it all behind

[Pre-Chorus]
Because I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life

[Chorus]
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why Georgia, why?

[Verse 2]
I rent a room and I fill the spaces with
Wood in places to make it feel like home
But all I feel's alone
It might be a quarter life crisis
Or just the stirring in my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Either way--I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life

[Chorus]
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why Georgia, why?

[Bridge]
So what, so I've got a smile on
But it's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head
Don't believe me
Don't believe me
When I say I've got it down

[Verse 3]
Everybody is just a stranger but
That's the danger in going my own way
I guess it's the price I have to pay

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Still "everything happens for a reason"
Is no reason not to ask myself

[Chorus]
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why? Tell me why?
Why? Why Georgia, why?

[Verse 1]
And hate runs through my blood
Well, my tongue was in love
But my heart was left above
I've got to be leaving now
I thought I'd never be shot down
But, girl, I'm black and blue
So beaten down for you
Well, I'm beaten down and blue

[Chorus]
Don't break away
I waste away
Don't break away

[Verse 2]
And lay me out across the grey
Hours I should have kept at bay
Well, I had no chance to get away
I can't escape my own escape
Even more when it's sweet to the taste
Red stairs lead sense astray
I look up and seek for faith
Oh, but girl, just lean over and say
Well lay me down
Pull me out
Well, take my crown again
He's submerged in doubt

[Verse 3]
But wait, I make my last request
See, this could be the best
But, blue, I need to rest
See, I been broken down
So much has lost it now
I just stop and say
Girl, don't you worry ‘bout a thing
Baby blue

[Intro: Macklemore]
Check it out, yeah

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
The risk of blunderin' to rap in front of a couple a hundred kids knowin' my licks is humblin'
Spit the struggle of an addict to puff in them swisher split but the light that was lit, I quickly run from it
I turn away from that source inside
A slicker for happiness, thinkin' I need a store to buy it
Recordin's priceless but look at how important ice is
I thought rhyming was forever now it's imported diamonds
My point is eyein', music that's absorbed my life an'
You glorify guns, they bust sex and drugs of course they'll try it
And I can't even front like I didn't, cause I still do and that's why I'm spittin'
I'm lookin' for this thing called moderation that I heard some found
The only problem with drugs is sometime you gotta come down
I lived half my life numb and bud drowned
And rum, vodka, how many bucks have I spent on dubs now?
I'm 23, look at my lungs now
The amount of THC from the swish of sweet blunt count?
I can't even conceive, that's why I run wild
In these streets like I was 13, like fuck now
I make that revolution music, but not for the army
A reminder against the vices that harm me
Cause I could never see how affected my lung is
You only get one shot at life, no ad-libs or punch ins

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Now, my mom once told me that we're not finished products, only
Authors of a book, and the object is to write it slowly
This is my last 16, I'll go for it
Four years in college and this is all I have to show for it
I said, this is my last song, so here's my passion
18 tracks, each one an attempt to take my mask off
Woo! The oral tradition's been passed on
While she ride the rhythm to the points that I'm a blast off
And as the music absorbs through
Me to be like Don P. hearin' beats from my dorm room
XP, It's been a joy and blessin'
My boy 'til my death and my Step-Cousin with voice from heaven
Yes, Budo! It was you who produced through
I am connected and now our friendship is the truth, dude
My last two are for NuNu of course
I dedicate it to you, but this album's already yours

It's been a long journey, and a struggle indeed, and I'm so glad that it's over
Thank you for listening
Until next time, peace and blessings

[Intro]
Mafia
The love, the love is bigger
The love, the love is bigger
The love, the love is bigger, big

[Verse 1]
Gotta believe in me (Gotta believe in me)
Believe me like a fairy tale
Your tooth under your pillowcase
No, I won't, I won't, ever, ever let you down (No)
Like a seesaw let you down (Oh)
You know why?
'Cause we ain't on the playground no more, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

[Chorus]
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger (I'm bigger) I'm bigger (Hey, hey)
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, woah

[Verse 2]
Remember when my heart was young?
It was still bigger than me (Still bigger than me)
Is that the reason that you stayed?
Most would've got rid of me (Hey)
Now the bullies in the schoolyard can't take our hugs and our kisses from us (No)
Because we ain't pushovers, no more, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

[Chorus]
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, hey
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger (Hey) I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, woah

[Bridge]
Remember those stone washed jeans (I remember that)
Don't knock your earrings (Like yesterday)
They shined on me (We were little then)
In class daydreaming of you (My baby)
(Just remember) You, wow wow
Since then all I can remember is the love's only gotten bigger
It's gone out of control

[Chorus]
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger (Bigger)
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small (so small) from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger (Our love's bigger)
I'm bigger (I'm bigger) and you're bigger (you're bigger), hey hey, hey
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, (I’m bigger) I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger (I ain’t small no more) and you're bigger, woah

[Verse 1]
I always knew you were the best
The coolest girl I know
So prettier than all the rest, the star of my show
So many times I wished you'd be the one for me
But never knew you'd get like this, girl
What'd you do to me?

[Pre-Chorus]
You're who I'm thinking of
And girl, you ain't my runner-up
And no matter what, you're always number one

[Chorus]
My prize possession, one and only
Adore you, girl, I want you
The one I can't live without
That's you, that's you
You're my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known, it's you, it's you
My favorite, my favorite
My favorite, my favorite girl
My favorite girl

[Verse 2]
You're used to going out your way to impress these Mr. Wrongs
But you can be yourself with me
I'll take you as you are
I know they said believe in love
It's a dream that can’t be real
So girl, let's write a fairytale and show 'em how we feel

[Pre-Chorus]
You're who I'm thinking of
And girl, you ain't my runner-up
And no matter what, you're always number one

[Chorus]
My prize possession, one and only
Adore you, girl, I want you
The one I can't live without
That's you, that's you
You're my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known, it's you, it's you
I want you
It's you, it's you
My favorite, my favorite
My favorite, my favorite girl
My favorite, girl

[Bridge]
You take my breath away with everything you say
I just want to be with you, my baby, my baby
Oh-oh, promise I'll play no games
Treat you no other way than you deserve
'Cause you're the girl of my dreams

[Breakdown]
My prize possession, one and only
Adore you, girl, I want you
The one I can't live without
That's you, that's you
You're my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known, it's you, it's you

[Chorus]
My prize possession, one and only
Adore you, girl, I want you (I want you, oh)
The one I can't live without
That's you, that's you
You're my special little lady (my special little lady)
The one that makes me crazy (the one that makes me crazy)
Of all the girls I've ever known, it's you, it's you
(You're my favorite girl)
My favorite, my favorite
(Favorite girl) My favorite, my favorite girl
(Favorite girl) My favorite, girl
(Favorite girl)
My favorite, my favorite
(Favorite girl) My favorite, my favorite girl
(Favorite girl) My favorite girl
Favorite girl

[Verse 1]
I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us, and we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face, it just tears me apart

[Pre-Chorus]
So we fight through the hurt
And we cry, and cry, and cry, and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try, and try, and try, and try

[Chorus]
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth

[Verse 2]
And mommy, you were always somewhere
And daddy, I live out of town
So tell me, how could I ever be normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best
So tell me, why am I in tears?
Woah, so far away and now I just need you here

[Pre-Chorus]
So we fight through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try and try and try and try

[Chorus]
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth

[Bridge]
We fell so far away from where we used to be
Now we're standing and where do we go?
When there's no road to get to your heart
Let's start over again

[Chorus]
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth

[Outro]
I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how

[Verse 1]
Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you all over again, oh
You're the light that feeds the sun in my world
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Out of all the things in life
That I could fear
The only thing that would hurt me
Is if you weren't here, woah

[Chorus]
I don't want to go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Girl, without you I'm lost, can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love, you're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Before your love was low, playing girls was my high
You changed the game, now I put my card to the side, ay
When broken hearts rise up to say, "Love is a lie"
You and I would stand to be love's reply, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Out of all things in life
That I could fear, yeah
The only thing that would hurt me
Is if you weren't here, here, here, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't want to go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Girl, without you I'm lost, can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love, you're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
I can't imagine life without your touch
And every kiss that you give, you fill me up
And through all the heart aching, jealous females hating
I'mma hold it down for you, you
Oh, woah, oh, you're the common denominator
Oh, yeah, whoa, I don't want to go back

[Chorus]
I don't want to go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Girl, without you I'm lost, can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love, you're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you all over again

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
For you, I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin, it's time to sink or swim
Watch 'em play for you
For you I'd be (Whoa oh), running a thousand miles
Just to get to where you are, step to the beat of my heart

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I don't need a whole lot but for you I admit I
I'd rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
Baby, listen

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I just need somebody to love
I, I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love, I don't need nothing else
I promise, girl, I swear, I just need somebody to love
I need somebody, I, I need somebody
I need somebody, I, I need somebody

[Verse 2: Usher]
Every day I bring the sun around
I sweep away the clouds, smile for me, smile for me
I would take every second, every single time
Spend it like my last dime, step to the beat of my heart

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
I don't need a whole lot, but for you, I admit I
I'd rather give you the world or you can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
So baby, listen

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Usher]
I just need somebody to love (Oh no no no no)
I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love, I don't need nothing else

Oh, find me somebody to love, oh

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Usher]

JB, you are, yeah man

[Intro]
With you, with you
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place

[Verse 1]
Now, Romeo and Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I both know it can't work
It's all fun and games 'til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you don't wanna let go, and I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two (Who knew?)
Now we don't want to fall, but we're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

[Chorus]
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do (Can do)
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

[Verse 2]
See like Adam and Eve, tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny and Cher, I don't care, I've got you baby
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
'Cause ain't no way it's going to end right but we are both too foolish to stop

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you don't wanna let go, and I don't wanna let you know
There might be something real between us two (Who knew?)
Now we don't wanna fall, but we're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

[Chorus]
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do (Can do)
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

[Bridge]
You see, like, just because this cold, cruel world saying we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't want to be so old and grey, reminiscing 'bout these better days
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know

[Breakdown]
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did, and everything we have is stuck in the moment, yeah

[Chorus]
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do (Nothing my heart can do)
To fight with time and space (And space)
Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

[Outro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I'd wait on you forever and a day
Hand and foot
Your world is my world, yeah
Ain't no way you're ever gon' get any less than you should

[Chorus]
'Cause baby
You smile, I smile, oh
'Cause whenever you smile, I smile
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Your lips, my biggest weakness
Shouldn't have let you know
I'm always gonna do what they say, hey
If you need me, I'll come running from a thousand miles away

[Chorus]
When you smile, I smile
Oh woah
You smile, I smile, hey

[Verse 3]
Baby, take my open heart and all it offers
'Cause this is as unconditional as it'll ever get
You ain't seen nothing yet
I won't ever hesitate to give you more

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you smile, I smile, whoa
You smile, I smile, hey, hey, hey
You smile, I smile, I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile, make me smile, baby

[Bridge]
Baby, you won't ever want for nothing
You are my ends and my means now
With you there's no in between, I'm all in
'Cause my cards are on the table and I'm willing and I'm able
But I fold to your wish cause it's my command, hey hey hey

[Chorus]
You smile, I smile, whoa
You smile, I smile, hey, hey, hey
You smile, I smile, I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile, oh

[Outro]
You smile, I smile
You smile, I smile

[Verse 1]
You see, my baby up and hit the road
Where she's going, I swear, nobody knows
I need to find her 'fore another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm just tryna be cool, cool, cool
What you expect me to do?
I'm just trying to find, find, find
The sweet love of mine

[Chorus]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not giving up
I gave it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

[Verse 2]
See, my baby really needs some help
Cause she can never stay at home by herself
She says she needs a little company
Even if she's not always with me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm just tryna be cool, cool, cool
What you expect me to do?
I'm just trying to find, find, find
The sweet love of mine

[Chorus]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not giving up
I gave it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

[Bridge]
Why can't I find you love of mine
When you're standing in front of my face?
Oh I, I must be blind
How did I let you get away?
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not giving up
I gave it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not giving up
I gave it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

[Verse 1: Jessica Jarrell]
It feels like we've been out at sea, oh
So back and forth, that's how it seems, oh
And when I wanna talk, you say to me
That if it's meant to be it will be, woah

[Pre-Chorus: Jessica Jarrell]
So crazy is this thing we call love
And now that we've got it, we just can't give up
I'm reaching out for you
Got me out here in the water and I

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm overboard and I need your love to pull me up
I can't swim on my own, it's too much
Feels like I'm drowning without your love
So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver
Life saver, oh life saver, oh
My life saver
Life saver, oh life saver, oh
Whoa

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I never understood you when you'd say, oh
You wanted me to meet you halfway, woah
I felt like I was doing my part
You kept thinking you were coming up short
It's funny how things change, cause now I see, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
So crazy is this thing we call love
And now that we've got it, we just can't give up
I'm reaching out for ya
Got me out here in the water and I

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]

I can't swim on my own, it's too much
Feels like I'm drowning without your love
So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver

[Bridge: Justin Bieber & Jessica Jarrell]
Oh, it's supposed to be some give and take, I know
But you're only taking and not giving anymore
So what do I do? Cause I still love you
And you're the only one who can save me
Woah, woah, woah

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Jessica Jarrell]
I'm overboard and I need your love to pull me up
I can't swim on my own, it's too much
Feels like I'm drowning without your love
So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver
Life saver, oh, life saver, oh
My life saver
Life saver, oh, life saver, oh
Whoa
Life saver, oh, life saver, oh
My life saver
Life saver, oh, life saver, oh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
It's a big big world
It's easy to get lost in it
You've always been my girl
And I'm not ready to call it quits
We can make the sun shine in the moonlight
We can make the grey clouds turn to blue skies
I know it's hard, baby, believe me

[Chorus]
That we can't go nowhere but up from here, my dear
Baby, we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we got to fear
We'll take it to the sky, past the moon, through the galaxy
As long as you're with me, baby
Honestly, with the strength of our love
We can go nowhere but up

[Verse 2]
It's a big big world, and I'm gonna show you all of it
I'm gonna lace you with pearls, oh
From every ocean that we're swimming in
We can make the sun shine in the moonlight
We can make the grey clouds turn to blue skies
Yeah, I know it's hard, baby, believe me, oh

[Chorus]
That we can't go nowhere but up from here, my dear
Baby, we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we got to fear

We're gonna make it girl, I promise
If you believe in love and you believe in us
We can go nowhere but up

[Chorus]
That we can't go nowhere but up from here, my dear
Baby, we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we got to fear
We'll take it to the sky, past the moon, through the galaxy

Honestly, with the strength of our love
We can go nowhere but up
Nowhere but up, nowhere but up
Woah, nowhere but up, woah
Yeah, nowhere but up, yeah yeah

[Intro]
Yeah, JB, yeah, woah, no no

[Verse 1]
Now I can see it girl, you ain't gotta say nothing
Your lips are calling me like they want to do something
I feel the chemistry, yeah you're into me
A little kiss is a definite possibility
Seen you a couple times, had a couple conversations
Since you've been on my mind, had a couple observations
Like you a fly chick, you could be my chick
Play by the rules and you can get what I give

[Pre-Chorus]
Just keep it quiet, keep it on the hush
And what we do, keep it just between us
I don't want to see you tweet about JB cause
The only people that should know is you and me so

[Chorus]
Baby I know that you're cool with rocking with me
But I can't have you telling everybody
You got me all twisted with your lips like this
So tell me, tell me are you gonna kiss kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss me then tell everybody?
Now she got me twisted with your lips girl
Are you gonna kiss and tell?

[Verse 2]
It's confidential, no one has to do with it
But you and me girl, telling would ruin it
Don't need that TMZ all in our privacy
Use them lips for kissing girl if you want to ride with me
And if you want to tell somebody
Then we can call the whole thing off; no problem
You can go your way and I'll go mine
But I'd rather spend a little time with you, yeah

[Pre-Chorus] + 

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell?
Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell?
Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell?
Kiss and tell, oh
Don't tell your homies, don't tell your mama
Don't tell your girlfriends, that'll start some drama
Stay off that Facebook, I'll treat you real good
You keep this private and you can get what I give

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Kiss and tell, whoa oh, I'm not about that
If you're gonna kiss and tell, oh no no no
If you're gonna kiss and tell
If you're gonna kiss and tell, that's not me

[Verse 1]
Where are you now when I need you the most?
Why don't you take my hand?
I want to be close
Help me when I am down, lift me up off the ground
Teach me right from wrong
Help me to stay strong

[Chorus]
So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free, yeah
Where are you now?

[Verse 2]
Where are you now now that I'm half grown?
Why are we far apart?
I feel so alone
Where are you now when nothing's going right?
Where are you now?
I can't see the light

[Chorus]
So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free, yeah

[Bridge]
I need you to need me
Can't you see me?
How could you leave me?
My heart is half empty
I'm not whole when you're not with me
I want you here with me
To guide me, hold me, and love me now
Where are you now?
Oh, where are you now?

[Chorus]
So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free, yeah
Oh, where are you now?

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

To pull up in the driveway, it's really comin' down tonight
You're scared that I won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me, safe and warm

[Chorus: The Band Perry & Justin Bieber]
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're drivin' here, through the winter snow
Baby, think of me
If it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby, think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber & with The Band Perry]
Pacing down the hallway, tryna fight the urge to call
I could almost hear a pin drop, except for the clock on the wall yeah, yeah
And I'm scared that you won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me, safe and warm

[Chorus: The Band Perry & Justin Bieber]
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here, through the winter snow

Home this Christmas

You and I 'til Christmas morning
There's nothing else that I want this year (I want this year)
More than just to have you here, I'll be waiting

[Chorus: The Band Perry & Justin Bieber]
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here, through the winter snow

Home this Christmas

Looking out the window waiting for your head lights
To pull up in the driveway, it's really coming down tonight

Round yon virgin, mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace

Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth

Baby, I will not pout, baby, I will not cry
'Cause I got your love this Christmas time
When the snow's on the ground and it's freezing outside

On every list I've ever sent
You're the gift I'd love the best
So deck the halls and all the rest
Warm me up, with your Christmas love

[Chorus]
Hey angel in the snow, I'm under the mistletoe
You are the one, you're my very own Christmas love
Tell Santa I'm cool this year, my present is standing right here
Thank God above for my very own Christmas love, yeah

[Verse 2]
Like a beautiful tree, you can light up the room
But your kind of a star can't be removed
Like a beautiful carol, I get lost in your song
And I will forever sing along

[Pre-Chorus]
On every list I've ever sent
You're the gift I'd love the best
So deck the halls and all the rest
Warm me up, with your Christmas love

[Verse 1]
Someday at Christmas men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December our hearts will see
A world where men are free
Someday at Christmas there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth

[Chorus]
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time

[Verse 2]
Someday at Christmas we'll see a man
No hungry children and no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care
Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One shining moment my heart ran away
From our world today

[Chorus]
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time

[Bridge]
Someday at Christmas man will not fail
Take hope because your love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart

[Chorus]
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time, someday at Christmas time

[Intro]
As long as you love me, yeah, oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
We're under pressure
Seven billion people in the world tryna fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning

[Pre-Chorus]
But hey now, you know, girl
We both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances

[Chorus]
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver and I'll be your gold
As long as you love me
As long as you love me, love me

[Verse 2]
I'll be your soldier
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
I'll be your Hova
You could be my Destiny's Child on the scene, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't stress and don't cry
We don't need no wings to fly
But just take my hand

[Chorus]
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver and I'll be your gold
As long as you love me
As long as you love me, love me

[Verse 3]
I don't know if this makes sense but, you're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place, I'll rendezvous it
I'll fly you to it, I'll beat you there, girl, you know I got you
Us, trust, a couple things I can't spell without U
Now we on top of the world, that's just how we do
Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's our point of view
Now we stepping out like oh God, cameras point and shoot
Ask me "What's my best side?" I stand back and point at you, you, you
The one that I argue with, feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side, it's green where you water it
So I know, we got issues baby, true, true, true, but I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new

[Chorus]
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver and I'll be your gold
As long as you love me, everything I need
As long as you love me, you love me, you love me, yeah
As long as you love me, you love, you love me, yeah

Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes

[Chorus]
Through the storm and through the clouds, bumps on the road and upside down
I know it's hard babe, to sleep at night, don't you worry
Cause everything's going to be alright

[Outro]
Cause all around the world

[Verse 1]
Well let me tell you a story about a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend, when she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right

[Pre-Chorus]
But did you know that I loved you? Or were you not aware?
Well you're the smile on my face and I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
But I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

[Chorus]
Who's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

[Verse 2]
Well I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't want to lose it either
But I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe, so take my hand

[Pre-Chorus]
Well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Well did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
Cause I know that a piece of you's gone every time he done wrong, I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song  I'll have figured out

[Chorus]
Who's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

[Bridge]
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall
And if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself

[Chorus]
Fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let you, let yourself fall, oh baby

[Verse 1]
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united over the fields
Where the good shepherd grieves
Desperate men, desperate women divided
Spreading their wings 'neath falling leaves

[Verse 2]
Fortune calls, I stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace
Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down
She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born
On Midsummer's Eve near the tower

[Verse 3]
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid
Whose ebony face is beyond communication
The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid

[Verse 4]
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow
Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil

[Verse 5]
I stumbled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo
Renegade priests and treacherous young witches
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you

[Verse 6]
The palace of mirrors where dog soldiers are reflected
The endless road and the wailing of chimes
The empty rooms where her memory is protected
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times

[Verse 7]
She wakes him up, forty-eight hours later the sun is breaking
Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long golden locks

[Verse 8]
Gentlemen, he said I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes
I've moved your mountains and marked your cards
But Eden is burning either get ready for elimination
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards

[Verse 9]
Peace will come with tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire
But will offer no reward when her false idols fall
And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating
Between the King and the Queen of Swords

[Intro: All]
As long as you love me

[Verse 1: Nick with Brian]
Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leaving my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me

[Chorus: All]
I don't care who you are
Where you're from, what you did
As long as you love me
Who you are, where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

[Verse 2: Brian with Kevin, Nick]
Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me (oooh, ooh-ooh)
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

[Chorus: All, Brian & Nick]
I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did, as long as you love me (I know)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

[Interlude: Nick & All]
Yeah-eh-eh!
As long as you love me

[Bridge: Brian with Howie & Nick, (Nick) & All]
I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're coming from
I don't care
As long as you love me, baby (oooh, ooh-ooh)

[Chorus: All, Brian & Nick]
I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did, as long as you love me
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did (yeah-eh-eh)
As long as you love me (as long as you love me)

[Outro: All, Brian & Nick]
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from, what you did
As long as you love me
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
As long as you love me
Who you are, as long as you love me
What you did, I don't care
As long as you love me

[Verse 1]
So I'm back, to the velvet underground
Back to the floor, that I love
To a room with some lace and paper flowers
Back to the gypsy that I was
To the gypsy that I was

[Verse 2]
And it all comes down to you
Well you know that it does
And lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
Oh, and it lights up the night
And you see your gypsy
You see your gypsy

[Bridge]
To the gypsy that remains
Faces freedom with a little fear
I have no fear, I have only love
And if I was a child
And the child was enough
Enough for me to love
Enough to love

[Verse 3]
She is dancing away from me now
She was just a wish
She was just a wish
And a memory is all that is left for you now
You see your gypsy, oh
You see your gypsy

[Outro]
Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
And it all comes down to you
And it all comes down to you
Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
And it all comes down to you
And it all comes down to you
I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes
And it all comes down to you
I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes
And it all comes down to you
I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes
(She was just a wish)
(She was just a wish)
And it all comes down to you
Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
And it all comes down to you

[Intro]
Let me start off with the old school flow

[Verse 1]
Let me start off with the old school flow
Snap back, backpack, rat-a-tat, go
Swagger at the knapsack, who know I could rap that?
Tell me where the cash at, I'll tell you where the smash at
Number one hits, I got number one flicks
And the number one kicks and number one chicks
Fast like Gordon and my jams like Jordan
And my Tims like Hortons and my jets all aboarded in
And my wheels are like a fortune and it feels like extortion
Is it for the fame or for the fortune?
Like this, mic this so I can re-sight this
People in their basements say that I didn't write this
People say I'm white so I couldn't do it like this
Checks like Nike. let me give you a good night kiss
Well I'm a little bit sick of it, listening to bickering
Like picking on a little kid, like taking all his licorice
I hate it when they littering, I hate to be illiterate
I literally am doing deeds, riddling
Cheese like Gouda and my soul like Buddha
And I'mma go right through you  and I'm so much cooler
And I don't need Luda
To know that I'm the ruler a
And I'm, so much cooler
You should call me Ferris Bueller

[Verse 1]
I just sit here waiting for you to call
And then I wonder if you’re even calling at all
So many thoughts in my mind
Wishing you could be here all the time

[Chorus x2]
Cause I'm lost without you
And I just can't doubt you
And there's something about you
I just can't live without you

[Intro]
I think I found my girl, if it’s you then holla
I think I found my girl, if it’s you then holla
I think I found my girl, if it’s you then speak to me

[Verse 1]
Girl it’s getting late, the sun's going down
And it’s about time I shake my way across the town
But before I go I just want to say
That you stay on my mind each and every day
I think I'm starting to like the time that we spent
And when it’s building inside, then I can’t pretend
No I don’t want to fight it, I don’t want to hide the way I feel
So I guess it’s time for me to say

[Pre-Chorus]
That I got eyes for you baby
I want us to be together
And if you feel it too
Tell me no one will treat you better

[Chorus]
Cause on nights like this
It’s good to know that you've got someone by your side like this
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this
And then you say, hope this will last forever

[Verse 2]
Don’t know if it's love, it's too early to say
But if it’s something like it, I just want it to remain
Don’t know if you’re the one that takes a little time
But in the meantime girl, you feeling just fine
Cause the way you look at me never seen that look before
And if it’s a hint of what’s to come then baby can I get some more
Not tryna be too forward
But I think it’s best for you to know

[Pre-Chorus]
That I got eyes for you baby
I want us to be together
And if you feel it too
Tell me no one will treat you better

[Chorus]
Cause on nights like this
It’s good to know that you've got someone by your side like this
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this
And then you say, hope this will last forever

[Bridge]
I think I found my girl, if it’s you then holla

I think I found my girl, if it’s you then speak to me
I think I found my girl, if it’s you then holla

I think I found my girl, if it’s you then speak to me

[Pre-Chorus]
That I got eyes for you baby
I want us to be together
And if you feel it too
Tell me no one will treat you better

[Verse 1]
Guiltiness (talking about guiltiness)
Pressed on their conscience
And they live their lives (they live their lives)
On false pretence everyday
Each and everyday

These are the big fish
Who always try to eat down the small fish
(These are the big fish)
A just the small fish
I tell you again: they would do anything
To materialize their every wish

[Chorus]
Woe to the downpressors
They will eat the bread of sorrow
Woe to the downpressors
They will eat the bread of sad tomorrow
Woe to the downpressors
They will eat the bread of sorrow

[Verse 2]
Guiltiness
(Talk about guiltiness)
Pressed on their conscience
These are the big fish
(These are the big fish)
Who always try to eat down the small fish
A just the small fish

[Bridge]
I tell you what: they would do anything(anything)
To materialize their every wish

[Chorus]
Woe to the downpressors
They will eat the bread of sorrow
Woe to the downpressors
They will eat the bread of sad tomorrow
Woe to the downpressors
They will eat the bread of sorrow

[Outro]
Guiltiness
They'll eat the bread of sorrow everyday

[Intro]
What? Wait
But yesterday we were
I don't understand

[Verse 1]
We started out it was perfect, nothing but fun
And my heart was convinced to say that you're the one
And I thought it would last for the rest of our lives
Boy was I in for a big surprise
With no doubt looking round, thinking that I'm so cool
Same place, same time every day of my life, could we meet after school?
Finally if I didn't make her cry
She wouldn't be with another guy

[Chorus]
Nothing can cure my headache
Cause I'm experiencing what they call heartbreak
It’s gonna hurt worse as long as I stay here
I know but man just let me lay here
Cause this is something that I can't shake
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak
They say it's only just as worse as you make it
I know but man just let me lay here

[Verse 2]
Now I'm all tore up taking back when I was at your door
The first time when you said, "Forever I'll be yours"
Started walking, your hand in my hand, feelings got stronger
We made a promise
And whenever I leave, it feels like you're still with me
But it all came crashing down
Sitting in my room I got to get out of here
What am I to do when I look up and you’re not there, woah?

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Say I'm too young for love
I got so much life to live ahead
But, if only this is love I could get over
I know I have to deal with the pain

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Now you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love

[Verse 1]
When you was just a young’un you’re looks but so precious
But now you’re grown up
So fly it's like a blessing but you can’t have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It’s seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

[Chorus]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love
How to love

[Verse 2]
I just want to take my time
I just want to do my thing
Maybe we press rewind
Maybe I buy that ring
We could grow old together
Just share our soul together
Find out how to love, kiss and hug
How to roll together
I just need you by my side
Baby we could be alright
I just want to hold you right
We could go into the night
You're the one I need

[Chorus]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Why you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love

[Bridge]
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault
Wasn’t in your intentions
You the one here talking to me
You don’t want to listen
But I admire your popping bottles and dipping
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad
Nobody else tripping
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook

[Chorus]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Why you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love

[Outro]
I just want you to know

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah-yeah
She's my Latin girl, she's my Latin girl

[Verse]
I was on the beach yeah, I was on vacation

Then you walked by, you caught my eye
I said "Who's this girl? She's looking super fly"

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey miss beautiful, I've never seen you before
And I would like to be the one to show you I am cool enough

[Intro]
I'll make you believe

[Verse 1]
I heard you're looking for somebody to treat you right
'Cause them other guys don't live up to their height
I heard you're looking for somebody to smack your heart
Cause they going, they shot before you start

[Pre-Chorus]
You aren’t got to search no further
I got what you want (right here)
I'm not trying to waste your time by telling you what you want (right here)
They can make you promises but I
I'll make you believe

[Chorus]
(Dance with me girl)
Believe, believe, believe (eeve)

I heard you’re looking for somebody to take control
Baby, give me the green light and we'll go
So let me love you, 'till my heart stops
Let me touch you, when the beat drops

Right there

[Pre-Chorus]
You aren’t got to search no further
I got what you want (right here)
I'm not trying to waste your time by telling you what you want (right here)
They can make you promises but I
I'll make you believe

[Chorus]
(Dance with me girl)
Believe, believe, believe (eeve)
(Dance with me girl)
Believe, believe, believe (eeve)
(Dance with me girl)
Believe, believe, believe (eeve)
They can make you promises but I
I'll make you believe

[Verse 1]
Walking on red dirt, no concrete pavement
Navy blue book bag on my back
Couple miles 'til I'm at the greyhound station
Hope they let me ride away with them
Got pretty mad at my father today
But I'm still thinking 'bout what my mother would say
As I'm singing an old song she used to sing
When things weren't going the way she wanted them to

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away, I do
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away from you
I wanna leave this school, I do, I wanna leave this town, I do
But she'll be worried sick if I do if I do

[Chorus]
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy
Mama's boy just don't

[Verse 2]
So I turn around and headed to the old run-down building
Bells gonna ring before I make it back
I watch the upper-classmen drive right past me
Wish they'd let me ride away with them
Still haven't got over it yet
It's been playing in my ears all morning I swear
My iPod's the same tune my mother would sing
When things weren't going the way she wanted them to

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away, I do
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away from you
I wanna leave this school, I do, I wanna leave this town, I do
But she'll be worried sick if I do if I do

[Chorus]
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy
Mama's boy just don't

[Bridge]
Never get mad enough to walkout
If I do then I won't be gone for long
Never fed up enough to leave her
No matter what I'll love her just the same
That's my mama, yeah
So no matter what I ain't leaving unless she's coming soon

[Chorus]
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy
Mama's boy just don't

[Intro]
Ride, I wanna ride
I wanna ride, I wanna ride

[Verse 1]
When I wake up, I first think of you
I really like you and I hope you like me too
The sky's the limit for me and you
I could be your queen, but you could be my boo

[Pre-Chorus]
We could go anywhere, to the moon and through the air
We could go to the movies or the mall, baby I don't care
Yeah this is true, wanna be with you
And I just wanna ride with you

[Chorus]
I wanna ride, by the ocean side, I wanna ride
I wanna ride, I wanna ride ride with you
I wanna ride, I wanna ride
I just want to ride with you

[Verse 2]
Whenever I'm with you, you make me feel special
And all my problems, they go right out the door
I love it when you call me baby, baby
It's you I adore, adore

[Pre-Chorus]
We could go anywhere, to the moon and through the air
We could go to the movies or the mall, baby I don't care
Yeah this is true, wanna be with you
And I just wanna ride with you

[Chorus]
I wanna ride, by the ocean side, I wanna ride
I wanna ride, I wanna ride ride with you
I wanna ride, I wanna ride
I just want to ride with you

[Bridge]
So let’s go right now, go slow right now
Let the bass go loud like that boom boom pow
So let’s go right now, go slow right now
Let the bass go loud like that boom boom pow

[Chorus]
I wanna ride, by the ocean side, I wanna ride
I wanna ride, I wanna ride ride with you
I wanna ride, I wanna ride
I just want to ride with you
I wanna ride, by the ocean side, I wanna ride
I wanna ride, I wanna ride ride with you
I wanna ride, I wanna ride
I just want to ride with you

[Outro]
I wanna ride, I wanna ride, I I ride
I wanna ride, I wanna ride, I just wanna ride with you

[Verse 1]
Spare me your judgements and spare me your dreams
'Cause recently mine have been tearing my seams
I sit alone in this winter clarity which clouds my mind

Alone in the wind and the rain you left me
It's getting dark, darling, too dark to see
And I'm on my knees, and your faith in shreds, it seems

[Verse 2]
Corrupted by the simple sniff of riches blown
I know you have felt much more love than you've shown
And I'm on my knees, and the water creeps to my chest

[Chorus]
But plant your hope with good seeds
Don't cover yourself with thistle and weeds
Rain down, rain down on me
Look over your hills and be still
The sky above us shoots to kill
Rain down, rain down on me

[Bridge]
But I will hold on, I will hold on hope
But I will hold on, I will hold on hope
Oh, I will hold on, I will hold on hope
But I will hold on, I will hold on hope
I will hold on, I will hold on

[Verse 3]
I begged you to hear me, there's more than flesh and bones
Let the dead bury the dead, they will come out in droves
But take the spade from my hands and fill in the holes you've made

[Chorus/Outro]
But plant your hope with good seeds
Don't cover yourself with thistle and weeds
Rain down, rain down on me
I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I squandered my resistance
For a pocket full of mumbles such are promises

All lies and jests
Still a man hears
What he wants to hear
And disregards the rest

When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway stations running scared

Laying low seeking out the poor quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places
Only they would know

Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come on
From the whores on seventh avenue
I do declare there were times
When I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there
Then I'm laying down my winter clothes
And wishing I was home going home
Where the New York City winters
Are bleeding me, bleeding me going home

In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminder of every glove that laid him down
And cut him till he cried out in his anger and his shame
I am leaving I am leaving but the fighter still remains

[Verse 1]
Things seemed strange this morning
As I packed my bag for school
The smiles I'm used to seeing just weren't there
I heard my father talking
To my mother down the hallway
Above the whispers all that I could hear 

[?] was

[Chorus]
Set a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat
Kick their shoes off, put their feet up
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When there's a place at your table
There's a little hope for you and I

[Verse 2]
I was feeling kind of helpless
About the words that I just heard
Could it be the family 2 doors down?
They said a couple months of bad luck
Had them up against the wall
And though it may seem small
I know there's something I can do

[Chorus]
Set a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat
Kick their shoes off, put their feet up
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When there's a place at your table
There's a little hope for you and I

[Bridge]
Make room at your table for your friends and family
Take the time to share your day, just laugh, talk and eat

[Chorus]
Set a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at your table for someone to sit down and eat
Kick their shoes off, put their feet up
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When there's a place at your table
There's a little hope for you and I

[Outro]

[?]there's a little hope for you and

[Verse 1]
Everybody's laughing in my mind
Rumours spreading 'bout this other guy
Do you do what you did when you did with me? Does he love you the way I can?
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me? Cause baby I didn't

[Chorus]
That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that that should be me, that should be me

[Verse 2]
You said you needed a little time from my mistakes
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies? What you doing to me, you're taking him where we used to go
Now if you're tryna break my heart, it's working cause you know that

[Chorus]
That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that that should be me

[Bridge]
I need to know should I fight for love or disarm
It's getting harder to shield, this pain in my heart, ooh

[Chorus]
That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that that should be me
Holding your hand, that that should be me
The one making you laugh oh baby, oh that should be me
That should be me giving you flowers, that should be me talking for hours
That should be me, that should be me, that should be me

[Outro]
Never gonna let you go, I'm never gonna let you go, go, oh
That should be me, I'm never gonna let you go, that should be me
Never gonna let you go, I'm never gonna let you go, go, oh
That should be me, I'm never gonna let you go, oh

[Intro]
Ha, it's Justin Bieber

[Pre-Chorus]
I can take you to a new world, take your problems away
Tell me what you want to do girl, just come right this way
I don't never need a new girl, no cause you're here to stay
Lemme show you what I do girl and you'll never leave

[Chorus]
You want me, girl, you know you want me
You want me, you want me
Girl, you know you want me right, go, right, go, right, right
Girl, you know you want me right

[Verse 1]
Yeah you said that you love me, yeah I said that I love you too
Let you know that you're lovely, flowers for nothing just for you
You know I got you until the whole world ends
You know I got you, won't you come and be my girlfriend?
Cause you're scared to fall, but you won't spread your wings
You know it's hard to fly when you don't try new things
And I'mma be the one to make you smile for a minute
Put your head down, lick it down for a minute
Baby, maybe this sounds crazy
Thinking about you lately
I just need a
I just need a lady, save me

[Pre-Chorus] + 

[Chorus] X2
She stole my heart and made me sing
She tore me limb from limb
I did not think that I could love
Or be loved that way again

Again, again

How glad I was to be myself
And use my heart once more
How glad I was to be a man
And love that girl that I adore

Adore, adore

Well my eyes shall see light again
And my heart shall bleed right again
Oh my eyes shall see light again
And my heart shall bleed right again

Har-har, har-har-har!
Skate park 'til the days dark
Then it's Roscoes with the whole fucking G Olf Wang
Wolf Gang same thing just the G's off
Sick fuck I got mini germs I feel like Adolf
Aye, Y'all motherfuckers thought I was gone fall off
Sorry, future brighter than what Stevie Wonder ain't saw
Ain't yaw jaw hurting from the hate, naw?
Ah fuck it mate... and my balls still ain't drop pause

Sick... Spittin' like the motherfucking droolin'
Ear to a sea shell listening to Frankie's new shit

Who's this motherfucking crew bringing cool back
To the rap bake sale makin' all the cake back
Made about one zero zero zero zero eight stacks
In a whole different fucking country where they hate rap
And they say 'Hey black, can I get my kids back?
You brain washed them with all that triple sixty six crap'
Tach it up, tach it up
Buddy gonna shut you down

It happened on the strip where the road is wide
Two cool shorts standin' side by side
Yeah, my fuel injected Stingray and a 413
We're revvin' up our engines and it sounds real mean

Tach it up, tach it up
Buddy gonna shut you down

Declinin' numbers at an even rate
At the count of one we both accelerate
My Stingray's light, the slicks are startin' to spin
But the 413's really diggin' in

Gotta be cool now, power shift, here we go

Superstock Dodge is winding out in low
But my fuel injected Stingray's really startin' to go
To get the traction, I'm ridin' the clutch
My pressure plate's burnin', that machine's too much
Pedal's to the floor hear the dual quads drink
And now the 413's lead is startin to shrink
He's hot with ram induction but it's understood
I got a fuel injected engine sittin' under my hood

Shut it off, shut it off, buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off, buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off, buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off, buddy now I shut you down
Weezy F Baby, F ya ladies so quick so fast

Whatchu know bout getting coke sucked off my dick then put it in her ass?

Everybody needs inspiration
Everybody needs a song
A beautiful melody
When the night's so long
'Cause there is no guarantee
That this life is easy

[Chorus]
Yeah, when my world is falling apart
When there's no light to break up the dark
That's when I, I
I look at you
When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you

[Verse 2]
When I look at you, I see forgiveness
I see the truth
You love me for who I am
Like the stars hold the moon
Right there where they belong
And I know I'm not alone

[Chorus]
Yeah, when my world is falling apart
When there's no light to break up the dark
That's when I, I
I look at you
When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you

[Bridge]
You appear just like a dream to me
Just like kaleidoscope colors that
Cover me, all I need
Every breath that I breathe
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you
I look at you

[Outro]
And you appear just like a dream to me

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
This one's for the lovers
Follow me

[Verse 1]
Clearly, this is new for me
I get excited when you're here, my dear
Make no mistake, you are all I see, sugar
My visions never been so clear, hah
We both know that I've been running so long
This time, love won't let me leave
Please be patient, hesitation aside
We're almost where we need to be
But in the meantime, let me say what's on my mind

[Chorus]
Baby I, I think we've got something special
Girl, you and me together, we'll take over the world
You know I love you, I need your soul
So happy, I just wanna let everybody know

[Bridge 1]
Think back to the time
When I was scared to let it show
Having too much fun, this and that or what
Now that you're mine
Ha, yeah, somewhere along the way, everything fell in place

[Verse 2]
I'm so proud of how you represent me, baby
Whether rocking Armani, Dolce Gabbana
Roberto Cavalli, Louie, or Gucci, girl
No matter what you wear, you do your own with it
I'll feel the same years from here
But in the meantime, let me say what's on my mind
Ooh, listen

[Chorus]
I think we've got something special
Girl, you and me together, we'll take over the world
You know I love you, I need your soul
So happy, I just wanna let everybody know
That I think we've got something special
Girl, you and me together, we'll take over the world
You know I love you, I need your soul
So happy, I just wanna let everybody know

[Bridge 2]
You know I need you baby, you know I do
I need you baby, you know I do
I need you baby, you know I do
Know I need you baby
Now that you're mine
Somewhere along the way, everything fell in place

[Chorus]
Baby, I think we've got something special
Girl, you and me together, we'll take over the world
You know I love you, I need your soul
So happy, I just wanna let everybody know
I think we've got something special
Girl, you and me together, we'll take over the world
You know I love you, girl, I need your soul
I'll never, never let you go, no

[Outro]
You're so special

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
I'll pick you up at seven, we can drive around and see a movie
Every scene will have a meaning, but you'll be the one that moves me
I've been hurt before, so baby, promise that you're gonna be true
I'm gonna be be good so tell me that you're gonna be good too, yeah

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
You gotta be be good to me
I'm gonna be be good to you
We'll be happy as can be
Just gotta be be good to me
Baby

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
Gonna treat you right, we're never gonna fight
Now baby, you can trust me
When I hold you tight, I feel alright
I guess that I'm just lucky
I've been hurt before, so baby, promise that you're gonna be true
I'm gonna be be good so tell me that you're gonna be good too

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
You gotta be be good to me
I'm gonna be be good to you
We'll be happy as can be
Just gotta be be good to me
Baby

[Bridge: Joe Jonas]
Listen girl, you gotta be good
I don't wanna hurt you
I wanna kiss you!

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
You gotta be be good to me
I'm gonna be be good to you
We'll be happy as can be
Just gotta be be good to me
Baby
You gotta be be good to me
I'm gonna be be good to you
We'll be happy as can be
Just gotta be be good to me
Yeah

[Outro: Joe Jonas]
Listen girl, you're outta control
I think that you and me would be a great coup-
Oh...
Yeah

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
She's such a flirt
And I am the lonely heart
Give it a chance
For our love to start
But you'll never see
If you don't give me a shot
To show you what I've got

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
But it's too late to pretend
You know me better than I know myself
Don't take my heart and put it on a shelf
Always someone else
The next guy who will make your cold heart melt
I'm gonna give my love to someone else

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
I held your hand (Ah, ah)
It felt like a movie
I made some plans (Ah, ah)
But you were already moving on now
I'm stuck under a rainy cloud
But you don't seem to care
But it's alright 'cause it's

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Too late to pretend
You know me better than I know myself
Don't take my heart and put it on a shelf, yeah
Always someone else
The next guy who will make your cold heart melt
I'm gonna give my love to someone else

[Bridge: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
I'm tired of wastin' all my time
My heart is hangin' on the line
Is it me, girl, or someone else?
Please take me off the shelf

[Breakdown: Nick Jonas]
Too late to pretend
You know me better than I know myself
Don't take my heart and put it on a shelf

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
Everybody
Always someone else
The next guy who will make your cold heart melt
I'm gonna give my love to someone else, yeah
Woo, ooh

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Called you for the first time yesterday
Finally found the missing part of me
I felt so close, but you were far away
Left me without anything to say

[Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
Now I'm speechless
Over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
I can't get your smile out of my mind
(I can't get you out of my mind)
I think about your eyes all the time
You're beautiful, but you don't even try
(You don't even, don't even try)
Modesty is just so hard to find

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Now I'm speechless
Over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again

[Bridge: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
I kissed her for the first time yesterday
Everything I wished that it would be
Suddenly I forgot how to speak
Hopeless, breathless, baby, can't you see?
Now I'm—
Yeah, oh!

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Now I'm speechless
Over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Now I'm hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again

[Outro: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
Oh, lovebug again

[Verse 1]
I feel like I'm gonna go insane
'Cause I keep hearing your voice call my name
In an empty room, girl, you're the one I see
Let me tell you, girl, we're history

[Chorus]
I'm a one man show (One man show)
I don't need no one (Need no one)
I'll be fine alone (Fine alone)
Oh, yeah
You can call me, but (Call me, but)
I won't pick up my phone (Up my phone)
'Cause I'm a one man show (One man show)
Oh, yeah
I don't need you, girl
Hey
Hey

[Verse 2]
Girl, you broke my heart and let me down
But I'd be better off if you were not around
Took my love and threw it on the ground
Saying goodbye, girl, don't make a sound

[Chorus]
I'm a one man show (One man show)
I don't need no one (Need no one)
I'll be fine alone (Fine alone)
Oh, yeah
You can call me, but (Call me, but)
I won't pick up my phone (Up my phone)
'Cause I'm a one man show (One man show)
Oh, yeah
I don't need you, girl

[Bridge]
I was so blind
Now, I finally see
Everything you did to me
We thought it might change
And we could find a place
Where we would be happy, too

[Chorus]
I'm a one man show
I don't need no one
I'll be fine alone (Fine alone)
Oh, yeah
You can call me, but (Call me, but)
I won't pick up my phone (Up my phone)
'Cause I'm a one man show (One man show)
Oh, yeah
I'm a one man show (One man show)
I don't need no one (Need no one)
I'll be fine alone (Fine alone)
Oh, yeah
You can call me, but (Call me, but)
I won't pick up my phone (Up my phone)
'Cause I'm a one man show (One man show)
Oh, yeah
I don't need you, girl
Hey
Hey

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
Well, here we are again
Throwing punch lines, no one wins
As the morning sun begins to rise, we're fading fast
And we won't work this out

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & (Joe Jonas)]
No, we're not gonna work this out tonight
(We won't work this out)
No, we're not gonna make this right
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye
(Give a kiss goodbye)
'Cause we're not gonna work this out tonight

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
Every single word's been said (Whoa)
Broke each other's hearts again (Oh)
As the starlit sky begins to shine, we're breaking down
She screams out

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & (Joe Jonas)]
No, we're not gonna work this out tonight
(We won't work this out)
No, we're not gonna make this right
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye
(Give a kiss goodbye)
'Cause we're not gonna work this out tonight

[Interlude: Joe Jonas]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
We don't have to fight tonight
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
We just gotta try tonight
(We got to work this out)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
We don't have to fight tonight
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
We just gotta try tonight

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & (Joe Jonas)]
No, we're not gonna work this out tonight
(We won't work this out)
No, we're not gonna make this right
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye
(Give a kiss goodbye)
'Cause we're not gonna work this out tonight

[Outro: Nick Jonas & (Joe Jonas)]
Well, there's no need to fight, we're just wasting time
(Tonight)
If you give it a try well then maybe you'll find
(We might work this out)
Well, we know we're in love, so let us keep it alive
(Keep it alive, keep it alive)
(Tonight)
I'm starting to see the morning light
We finally worked this out

[Verse 1]
You warned me that you were gonna leave
I never thought you would really go
I was blind, but baby, now I see
Broke your heart, but now I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That I was bein' such a fool
And that I didn't deserve you

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I don't know if I'll get up
And I don't wanna cause a scene
But I'm dyin' without your love
Begging to hear your voice
Tell me you love me too
'Cause I'd rather just be alone
If I know that I can't have you

[Verse 2]
Lookin' at the letter you that you left
(The letter that you left, will I ever get you back?)
Wondering if I'll ever get you back
Dreaming about when I'll see you next
(When will I see you next? Will I ever get you back?)
Knowing that I never will forget
(I won't forget, I won't forget)

[Pre-Chorus]
That I was bein' such a fool
And That I still don't deserve you

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I don't know if I'll get up
And I don't wanna cause a scene
But I'm dyin' without your love
Begging to hear your voice
Tell me you love me too
'Cause I'd rather just be alone
If I know that I can't have you

[Bridge]
So tell me what we're fighting for
'Cause we know that truth means so much more
'Cause you would if you could, don't lie
'Cause I give everything that I've got left
To show you I mean what I have said
I know I was such a fool
But I can't live without you

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fall asleep
I don't know if I'll get up
I don't wanna cause a scene
I'm dyin' without your love
Begging to hear your voice
Tell me you love me too
'Cause I'd rather just be alone
If I know that I can't have you
I don't wanna fall asleep (I don't wanna fall asleep)
'Cause I don't know if I'll get up (Don't know if I'll get up)
And I don't wanna cause a scene
Cause I'm dyin' without your love (Yeah)
Begging to hear your voice (Begging to hear your voice)
Tell me you love me too (Tell me you love me too)
'Cause I'd rather just be alone
If I know that I can't have you

[Intro: Fan Girl]
OMG, did you hear I'm dating a Jonas Brother?
It's so hot!

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
You met in work, you should've known better
It's gonna suck when the camera stops rolling
And you'll find out soon that the treatment wasn't worth it
They're all the same, they all want the money
They're all insane, they live for fame, honey
They laugh at you when you're not even being funny

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nick Jonas]
Well, I've been here before
And I've seen firsthand and front row seat
This little thing they call a video girl

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Video girl rocked my world for a whole two seconds
And now I know I'm not about to be another victim
(Of the video girl syndrome)
Get out of my face, get out of my space
Get some class and kiss the past
'Cause I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
You know it's bad when your mama doesn't like her
All your friends saying she's a liar
Never ending phone calls aren't enough
(It's not enough, it's never enough)
Move to LA, got no talent
Not even like you won a Miss Teen pageant
Daddy pays your bills, but you still whine

[Pre-Chorus 2: Nick Jonas]
Well, I've been here before
And I've seen firsthand and front row seat
What happens to a man when he gets in the hands of a

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Video girl rocked my world for a whole two seconds
And now I know I'm not about to be another victim
(Of the video girl syndrome)
Get out of my face, get out of my space
Get some class and kiss the past
Cause I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome

[Bridge: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
You are never gonna see me miss her
Video girl syndrome
I'm not gonna be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Video girl rocked my world for a whole two seconds
And now I know I'm not about to be another victim
(Of the video girl syndrome)
Get out of my face, get out of my space
Get some class and kiss the past
'Cause I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome
'Cause I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
Run, run like you do
I'm chasing you
I'm on your tail, I'm gaining fast, you're going nowhere
Try to fix what you've done
And turn back the sun
The night is calling, and we're falling faster now

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Pushin' me away
Every last word, every single thing you say
Pushin' me away
Try to stop me now, but it's already too late
Pushin' me away
If you really don't care, then say it to my face
Pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
Stop, tell me the truth
'Cause I'm so confused
Spinning around, these walls are falling down, and I need you
More than you know
I'm not letting go
I'm getting close, so take my hand and please just tell me why

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Pushin' me away
Every last word, every single thing you say
Pushin' me away
Try to stop me now, but it's already too late
Pushin' me away
If you really don't care, then say it to my face
Pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away

[Bridge: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
Push, push, pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away
Push, push, pushin' me away
Push, push, pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away, oh

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Pushin' me away
Every last word, every single thing you say
Pushin' me away
Try to stop me now, but it's already too late
Pushin' me away
If you really don't care, then say it to my face
Pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away

[Outro: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Pushin' me away

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Broken hearts and last goodbyes
Restless nights by lullabies helps make this pain go away
I realize I let you down, told you that I'd be around
Building up the strength just to say

[Chorus: Jonas Brothers]
I'm sorry for breaking all the promises
That I wasn't around to keep
You told me this time is the last time
That I will ever beg you to stay
But you're already on your way

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
Filled with sorrow, filled with pain
Knowing that I am to blame for leaving your heart out in the rain
And I know you're gonna walk away
Leave me with the price to pay, before you go I wanted to say
Yeah

[Chorus: Jonas Brothers]
That I'm sorry for breaking all the promises
That I wasn't around to keep
You told me this time is the last time
That I will ever beg you to stay
But you're already on your way

[Bridge: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
I can't make it alive on my own
But if you have to go, then please girl, just leave me alone
'Cause I don't wanna see you and me going our separate ways
Begging you to stay if it isn't too late

[Chorus: Jonas Brothers]
I'm sorry for breaking all the promises
That I wasn't around to keep
You told me this time is the last time
That I will ever beg you to stay
But you're already on your way

[Outro: Jonas Brothers]
But you're already on your way

[Verse 1]
Hey, there, pretty lady
Tell me how you're doing
Tell me what can I do to help
'Cause I've been thinking of you for a little while now
And this, right here, is how I feel

[Chorus]
Girl, you got me going crazy
Knock me off my feet
Now, you got me begging, baby
Begging, baby, please
All I wanna know is do you wanna get away?
Get away with me
'Cause girl, I don't know what to do
'Cause I'm so in love with you

[Verse 2]
Head over my heels
Yeah, I know how I feel
Girl, you know that I'm in love
Oh, I was so lonely
Now, I know you love me
This, right here, is how I feel

[Chorus]
Girl, you got me going crazy
Knock me off my feet
Now, you got me begging baby
Begging, baby, please
All I wanna know is do you wanna get away
Get away with me?
'Cause girl, I don't know what to do
'Cause I'm so in love with you

[Bridge]
Come on
All I wanna know is do you wanna get away?
Yeah

[Chorus]
Girl, you got me going crazy
Knock me off my feet
Now, you got me begging, baby
Girl, I'm on my knees
All I wanna know is do you wanna get away
Get away with me?
'Cause girl, I don't know what to do 'cause I'm so in love
So in love
So in love with you
Ah

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Got the news today
Doctor said I had to stay a little bit longer and I'll be fine
When I thought it'd all been done
When I thought it'd all been said
A little bit longer and I'll be fine

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
But you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low
And every time you smile, you laugh, you glow
You don't even know, no, no
You don't even know

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
All this time goes by, still no reason why
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
Waiting on a cure, but none of them are sure
A little bit longer and I'll be fine

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
But you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low
And every time you smile, you laugh, you glow
You don't even know, no, no
You don't even know

[Breakdown: Nick Jonas]
You don't even know, no, no
You don't even know, no, no
Yeah

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
But you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low, yeah
And every time you smile, you laugh, you glow
You don't even know, yeah, oh
You don't even know, no, no

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
So I'll wait 'til kingdom come
All the highs and lows are gone
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
I'll be fine
Yeah..
I got some shit I need to get off my chest
So just shut the fuck up and listen!

[Hook]
The realest shit I ever wrote in my life, in my life, in my life
In my life… in my life, in my life, in my life…
The realest shit I ever wrote in my life, in my life, in my life
In my life… in my life, in my life, in my life…
In my life, my life, my life…

[Verse 1]
Time and time again, I ask myself
Who’s listening?
Who feels my pain?
Who feels my thoughts?
Who’s on the road that I’m travelling?
But I can’t complain
These are just my words
You would feel the same if you was in my skin
If you was in my shoes
And you went all the days that I went struggling and hustling
If you spent all the nights that my momma cried
Those endless nights, those weary eyes
Everyone in the house would just fuss and fight
Flipping over furniture, grabbing knives
We’d call the cops, here they come again
All the things in life I couldn’t comprehend
We ignored our problems, we’d just pretend
That they wasn’t there, like they didn’t exist
In Eastside Decatur our situation made us
React the the way that we did
All the nights that we had to freeze
“Oh no, huddle up, here comes the wind!”
On a stormy night in a flooded house
I can still hear the raindrops pourin’ in
And they pourin’ in, it’s pourin’ in
I can still hear the raindrops pourin’ in

[Hook]
The realest shit I ever wrote in my life, in my life, in my life
In my life… in my life, in my life, in my life…
The realest shit I ever wrote in my life, in my life, in my life
In my life… in my life, in my life, in my life…
In my life, my life, my life…

[Verse 2]
That’s why my attitude is “fuck the world”
I see most these rappers as a bunch of girls
Scary-ass niggas, this a poltergeist
Kick these niggas offstage like an open mic
Niggas know who I am behind the music
Even when they gone, I’mma still be here
I done made more money off a single album
Then you’ll probably ever see throughout your whole career
Y’all ain’t boss, y’all lightweight
We smoke pounds, y’all pound cake
That’s why real niggas don’t fuck with y’all
Y’all sweet to the air like soundscapes
And the crazy thing about it
I ain’t gotta do this rap shit
I could make a million off of royalties
And turn around and buy the rights to your masters
I ain’t gotta feel the fake persona
Full of goons in my squad who appear to be bolder
I’m from the ‘hood, man, I ain’t from the streets
I took a different path, the one that lasted longer
And now I’m straight for life, and my team is eatin’
And that’s all I owe, and that’s the way I see it
So leave me the fuck alone
And let me smoke this blunt to myself this evening

[Hook]
The realest shit I ever wrote in my life, in my life, in my life
In my life… in my life, in my life, in my life…
The realest shit I ever wrote in my life, in my life, in my life
In my life… in my life, in my life, in my life…
In my life, my life, my life…

[Verse 3]
What am I supposed to be?
Am I supposed to smile, am I supposed to grin, huh?
For White America to let me in
Should I assume a role that’s none threatening?
“Oh, Bobby Ray, you so cool in your raps”
“All that other garbage, you don’t talk like that”
Meanwhile, I just left the strip club an hour ago
Now I’m thinkin’ bout turning back
Tell me who’s the author that writes the script
I’m what it means to be, to be a lyricist
Obviously, I’m in a league of my own
So I don’t get offended if I ain’t on your list
This takes me back, back in the day
? when I was broke as shit
Failed every test, every class I skipped
I was in my zone with a pad and pen
I didn’t understand, I was just a kid
So misunderstood, never had a friend
I was so depressed, always upset
Here I go, contemplating suicide again
I was all alone, I was out of touch
Little did I know that I was out of sight
So I kept my headphones all the way turnt up
Waiting for the moment when the time was right
Now the time is right
Now the time is right, yeah..

[Hook]
The realest shit I ever wrote in my life, in my life, in my life
In my life… in my life, in my life, in my life…
The realest shit I ever wrote in my life, in my life, in my life
In my life… in my life, in my life, in my life…
In my life, my life, my life…

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
This has been no walk in the park
I feel like we have fallen apart
Open up your eyes, girl, and see
How wonderful this love could be

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Hold on tight, it's a rollercoaster ride we're on
So, say goodbye 'cause I won't be back again
Up and down, you're all around
Say goodnight and goodbye
La-la, la, la, la, la-la-la-la

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
You say you didn't mean to break my heart
But, girl, you did, I'm over it
Adieu to you and all your games
And all your crazy friends
This is the end

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Hold on tight, it's a rollercoaster ride we're on
So, say goodbye 'cause I won't be back again
Up and down, you're all around
Say goodnight and goodbye
La-la, la, la, la, la-la-la-la

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
Well, girl, I'm sorry for disappointing you
But I'm done with being up and down and pushed around
No more

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Hold on tight, it's a rollercoaster ride we're on
So, say goodbye 'cause I won't be back again
Up and down, you're all around
Say goodnight and goodbye
Hold on tight, it's a rollercoaster ride we're on
So, say goodbye 'cause I won't be back again
Up and down, you're all around
Say goodnight and goodbye

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
I woke up on my roof with my brothers
There's a whale in the pool with my mother
And my dad paints the house different colors
Where would we be, if we couldn't dream?

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
And I know we get a little crazy
And I know we get a little loud
And I know we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free, we are more than you think
So, call us freaks, but that's just the way we roll

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
You've got moves, I've got shoes, let's go dancing
Pop and lock, battle dance against Hanson
If we lose, all the girls, they'll be laughing
Where would we be, if we couldn't dream?

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
And I know we get a little crazy
And I know we get a little loud
And I know we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free, we are more than you think
So, call us freaks, but that's just the way we roll

[Bridge: Joe Jonas]
'Cause we're old enough to know
We're never letting go
'Cause that's just the way we roll

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
And I know we get a little crazy
And I know we get a little loud
And I know we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free, we are more than you think
So, call us freaks, but that's just the way we roll
And I know we get a little crazy
And I know we get a little loud
And I know we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free, we are more than you think
So, call us freaks, but that's just the way we roll
That's just the way we roll
Oh, that's just the way we roll

[Verse 1]
Hello, beautiful
How's it going?
I hear it's wonderful in California
I've been missing you
It's true

[Chorus]
But tonight, I'm gonna fly
Yeah, tonight, I'm gonna fly
'Cause I could go across the world
And see everything and never be satisfied
If I couldn't see those eyes

[Verse 2]
Hello, beautiful
It's been a long time
Since my phone's rung
And you've been on that line
I've been missing you
It's true

[Chorus]
But tonight, I'm gonna fly
Yeah, tonight, I'm gonna fly
Oh yeah
'Cause I could go across the world
And see everything and never be satisfied
If I couldn't see those eyes

[Verse 1]
She was all I ever wanted
She was all I ever needed and more
But she walked out my door

[Pre-Chorus]
Then she went away
Left my heart in two
Left me standing here
Singing all these blues

[Chorus]
You left without a single word
Not even sorry
It might've hurt worse to hear you say
I'm leaving, goodbye
But your smile still makes my heart sing
Another sad song
I can't forget it
I won't regret it
'Cause I'm still in love with you

[Verse 2]
We had fun under the sun
And when winter came, she'd be my angel
We were so in love

[Pre-Chorus]
Then, she went away
Left my heart in two
Left me standing here
Singing all these blues, yeah

[Chorus]
You left without a single word
Not even sorry
It might've hurt worse to hear you say
I'm leaving, goodbye
But your smile still makes my heart sing
Another sad song
I can't forget it
I won't regret it
'Cause I'm still in love with you
Still in love with you

[Bridge]
I don't know what hurts worse, baby
Seeing you with him or being alone
On my own
I know he doesn't love you, baby
Not like I did
Oh, what's the point?
You're not listening anyway

[Chorus]
You left without a single word
Not even sorry
It might've hurt worse to hear you say
I'm leaving, goodbye
But your smile still makes my heart sing
Another sad song
I can't forget it
I won't regret it
'Cause I'm still in love with you
You left without a single word
Not even sorry
It might've hurt worse to hear you say
I'm leaving, goodbye
But your smile still makes my heart sing
Another sad song
I can't forget it
I won't regret it
'Cause I'm still in love with you

[Verse 1]
You never listen to me
I know I'm better off alone
Everybody knows it's true
Yeah, we all see through you
No, it won't be hard to do
Throw away my stuff from you

[Chorus]
And I'll wait for her to come
She won't break my heart
'Cause I know she'll be from Australia
She is so beautiful
She's my dream girl
La, la, la, la, la, la
She's my dream girl

[Verse 2]
You were the one I thought I
Needed, I'm better off alone
Everybody knows it's true
They know all your secrets
The only thing you knew was true
Has just walked out of your life
How does it feel?

[Chorus]
So I'll wait for her to come
She won't break my heart
'Cause I know she'll be from Australia
She is so beautiful
She's my dream girl
La, la, la, la, la, la
She's my dream girl

[Bridge]
She will be there, to love and to care
I know there's no need to worry
The girl of my dreams
The one that will be
There to hold me when I'm down
'Til she's around

[Chorus]
And I'll just wait for her to come
She won't break my heart
'Cause I know she'll be from Australia
She is so beautiful
She's my dream girl
La, la, la, la, la, la
She's my dream girl
Oh yeah
And I'll wait for her to come
She won't break my heart
'Cause I know she'll be from Australia
She is so beautiful
She's my dream girl
La, la, la, la, la, la
She's my dream girl (Dream girl)

[Verse 1]
I'm waiting for you right outside
The place we first locked eyes (Oh)
I feel like we're both losing sight
We don't get to do this twice
And I wonder

[Chorus]
Will you care
When I'm gone
And it's done?
And I've really had enough
And I'm sorry
For the trouble
That's been costing us so much
Splitting apart, it's getting harder to tell what you want
So bored with these games (Games), games (Games)

[Verse 2]
The last time that I left these steps
Was after our first kiss
I wonder why you haven't shown
I'll be leaving here alone
And I wonder

[Chorus]
Will you care
When I'm gone
And it's done?
And I've really had enough
And I'm sorry
For the trouble
That's been costing us so much
Splitting apart, it's getting harder to tell what you want
So bored with these games (Games), games (Games)

[Bridge]
(So bored with these games)
Splitting apart, it getting hard to tell what you want
So bored with these games
(So bored with these games)
Splitting apart, it getting hard to tell what you want
(Yeah) So bored with these games
(So bored with these games)
Splitting apart, it getting hard to tell what you want
So bored with these
I'm left in the dark
I never thought you would be breaking my heart
So bored with these games (Games), games (Games)

[Chorus]
Will you care
When I'm gone
And it's done?
And I've really had enough
And I'm sorry
For the trouble
That's been costing us so much
Splitting apart, it's getting harder to tell what you want
So bored with these games (Games), games (Games)

[Outro]
Games (Games), oh, games
Games

[Verse 1]
Take my hand tonight
We can run so far
We can change the world to anything we want
We can stop for hours, just staring at the stars
They shine down to show us

[Chorus]
You know when the sun forgets to shine
I'll be there to hold you through the night
We'll be running so fast, we can fly tonight
And even when we're miles and miles apart
You're still holding all of my heart
I promise it will never be dark
I know we're inseparable

[Verse 2]
We could run forever if you wanted to
I would not get tired
Because I'd be with you
I keep singing this song until the very end
We have done all these things

[Chorus]
You know when the sun forgets to shine
I'll be there to hold you through the night
We'll be running so fast, we can fly tonight
And even when we're miles and miles apart
You're still holding all of my heart
I promise it will never be dark
I know we're inseparable

[Bridge]
I would give it all
Never let you fall
'Cause you know, we're inseparable
I would give it all
Just to show you I'm in love
'Cause you know, we're inseparable

[Chorus]
You know when the sun forgets to shine
I'll be there to hold you through the night
We'll be running so fast, we can fly tonight
And even when we're miles and miles apart
You're still holding all of my heart
I promise it will never be dark
I know we're inseparable

[Verse 1]
There she goes again
The girl I'm in love with
It's cool we're just friends
We walk the halls at school
We know it's casual
It's cool we're just
I don't wanna lead you on, no
The truth is I've grown fond, yeah

[Chorus]
Everyone knows it's meant to be
Falling in love, just you and me
'Til the end of time
'Til I'm on your mind
It'll happen
I've been making lots of plans
Like a picket fence and a rose garden
I'll just keep on dreaming
But it's cool 'cause we're just friends

[Verse 2]
Small talk on IM
Just one word sentences
It's cool, we're just friends
If I had my way
We would talk and talk all day
Yeah

[Chorus]
Everyone knows it's meant to be
Falling in love, just you and me
'Til the end of time
'Til I'm on your mind
It'll happen
I've been making lots of plans
Like a picket fence and a rose garden
I'll just keep on dreaming
But it's cool 'cause we're just friends

[Bridge]
Thinking about how
We're gonna say our vows
It's cool, we're just friends
As she walks down the aisle
I see all my friends smile
'Cause now we're more than friends

[Chorus]
Everyone knows it's meant to be
Falling in love, just you and me
'Til the end of time
'Til I'm on your mind
It'll happen
We've been making lots of plans
Like a picket fence and a rose garden
I'll just keep on dreaming
Keep on thinking
Of when we used to be just friends

[Outro]
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
When we used to be just friends
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, yeah
La, la, la, la, yeah
When we used to be just friends

[Verse 1]
As time was ticking, we were winning
And it all was going as planned
Politicians stand between the
Lines of making headlines, street signs
Saying you're going the wrong way
Fading faster now

[Chorus]
You can try to break us
And make us fall apart
But the fires in our hearts
Reminisce on memories 'cause we're gone
And don't forget to
Hold back your thoughts and live like robots
'Cause we all know what goes on
Reminisce on memories 'cause we're gone
We're gone, so gone

[Verse 2]
Fallen soldiers, all around us
But we're still standing strong
Embarrassing and contradicting
'Cause now we're making headlines, primetime
Saying, "What a story!"
Billboards, packed tours
Don't forget

[Chorus]
You can try to break us
And make us fall apart
But the fires in our hearts
Reminisce on memories 'cause we're gone
And don't forget to
Hold back your thoughts and live like robots
'Cause we all know what goes on
Reminisce on memories 'cause we're gone
We're gone, so gone

[Bridge]
And game over, you're done
Out of left field, we won
Pack our bags
Yeah, we'll run
Hollywood, here we come

[Chorus]
You can try to break us
And make us fall apart
But the fires in our hearts
Reminisce on memories 'cause we're gone
And don't forget to
Hold back your thoughts and live like robots
'Cause we all know what goes on
Reminisce on memories 'cause we're gone
We're gone, so gone

[Outro]
You can try to break us
And make us fall apart
But the fires in our hearts
Reminisce on memories 'cause we're gone

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
One day, when I came home at lunchtime
I heard a funny noise
Went out to the backyard to find out
If it was one of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a Flux Capacitor

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine"

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boy bands, and another one, and another one
And another one
Girls there with round hair like Star Wars
Float above the floor

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
We drove around in a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah, woo

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine"

[Bridge: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
I took a ship to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
It had outsold Kelly Clarkson
I took a ship to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
(Seventh album, seventh album)

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine, oh

[Chorus: Nick & Joe Jonas, and Kevin Jonas]
He said, "I've been to the year 3000" (Yeah, yeah)
"Not much has changed, but they lived underwater" (Oh, yeah)
"And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine, doin' fine"

[Chorus: Nick & Joe Jonas, and Kevin Jonas]
He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater" (Oh, yeah)
"And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine"

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine"

[Verse 1]
Her voice is echoed in my mind
I count the days till she is mine
Can't tell my friends 'cause they will laugh
I love a girl from senior class

[Verse 2]
I daydream through my freshman math
While she fills out her college apps
I'll show her a world where we belong
But she'll have to drive us to the prom

[Chorus]
That's what I go to school for
Even though it is a real bore
You can call me crazy
She is so amazing
That's what I go to school for
Even though it is a real bore
Girlfriends, I've had plenty
But she's the one that I need
That's what I go to school for
That's what I go to school for

[Verse 3]
Her boyfriend's just turning nineteen
But that doesn't bother me
He's back at college out of town
I find a reason to go around
I climb a tree outside her home
To make sure that she's alone
She looks up and sees me there
Still I can't help but stop and stare

[Chorus]
That's what I go to school for
Even though it is a real bore
You can call me crazy
She is so amazing
That's what I go to school for
Even though it is a real bore
Girlfriends, I've had plenty
But she's the one that I need
That's what I go to school for
That's what I, that's what I, that's what I go to school for

[Bridge]
Everyone that you see all day knows you're looking at me in a different way
I guess that's why my marks are getting so high
I can see those tell tale signs telling me that I was on your mind
I could see that you want it more when you told me that I'm what you go to school for
I'm what you go to school for

[Verse 4]
She's made her choice and I'm the one
At least 'til graduation comes
We drive past school to wave goodbye
My friends, they can't believe their eyes

[Chorus]
That's what I go to school for
Even though it is a real bore
You can call me crazy
She is so amazing
That's what I go to school for
Even though it is a real bore
Girlfriends, I've had plenty
But she's the one that I need
That's what I go to school for
That's what I, that's what I, that's what I go to school for

[Intro]
Oh, whoa, whoa, yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been wasting my time
I've been losing my mind
I've been running races
Still don't know what I've been chasing
But my eyes still can see
Bluer skies that wait for me
And I'm on my way

[Chorus]
It's time for me to fly
Time for me to soar
Time for me to open up my heart and knock on heaven's door
Time for me to live
It's time for me to sing
Time for me to lay down all my worries and I'll spread my wings
Time for me to fly
Woo!

[Verse 2]
The earth can be a heavy ride
When the clouds are in your eyes
But I feel a calling
I will rise, I won't be falling
And I'll escape the gravity
And I'll reach my destiny
And I'll fly away

[Chorus]
It's time for me to fly
Time for me to soar
Time for me to open up my heart and knock on heaven's door
Time for me to live
It's time for me to sing
Time for me to lay down all my worries and I'll spread my wings
Time for me to fly

[Bridge]
Time for me to fly
The gates of Heaven will open wide
I will be, I will rise
There won't be compromise
As I take to the open skies
(One, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
It's time for me to fly
Time for me to soar
Time for me to open up my heart and knock on heaven's door
Time for me to live
It's time for me to sing
Time for me to lay down all my worries and I'll spread my wings
Time for me to fly

[Break]
(I'm gonna fly)
I will fly away
I will fly away
I will fly away
(You know I'm gonna fly away, yeah)
I will fly away
I will fly away (I'm gonna fly away)
I will fly away

[Chorus]
It's time for me to fly
Time for me to soar
Time for me to open up my heart and knock on heaven's door
Time for me to live
It's time for me to sing
Time for me to lay down all my worries and I'll spread my wings
Time for me to fly

[Verse 1]
Wednesday, I came home from school
Did my homework in my room
Then I watched some TV
I still miss you
Thursday morning, went online
Got to school at half past nine
Wound up in detention
I still miss you

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything I do, oh
Brings me back to you

[Chorus]
And I die
One day at a time
'Cause I just can't seem to get you off my mind
No matter how I try
Try to kill the time
Well, I think that I'm just going crazy
One day at a time

[Verse 2]
Friday, I got out of bed
Tried to smile, frowned instead
Burnt some toast for breakfast
I still miss you
Saturday, I turned sixteen
Never dreamt you'd act so mean
You didn't even call me
But I still miss you

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I turn ninety-four
I think I'll miss you even more

[Chorus]
And I die
One day at a time
'Cause I just can't seem to get you off my mind
No matter how I try
Try to kill the time
Well, I think that I'm just going crazy
One day at a time

[Bridge]
I miss you more than I did a minute ago
I'd climb a mountain just to hear your echo, you (You)
All I wanted was you
Tell me, please, do you think of me now and then?
'Cause if I never see you again
I'd still miss you

[Chorus]
And I die
One day at a time
'Cause I just can't seem to get you off my mind
No matter how I try
Try to kill the time
Well, I think that I'm just going crazy
One day at a time

[Outro]
Oh, one day at a time
Well, I think that I'm just going crazy
One day at a time
Oh, I think I'm going crazy, ooh
One day at a time

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
She's the kinda girl that you see in the movies
Seen her in my dreams and now she's standing next to me
Down by the shore, first weekend of the summer
Gotta take a chance and just ask for her number
I wish I had a song on MTV
'Cause in a crowded room, I'd be the only one shed see
She's looking bored and now, I'm running out of time
I've only got six minutes if I'm gonna make her mine

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
One minute and the earth begins to shake
Two minutes and my heart begins to break
Another minute and she makes me feel brand new
That's just three minutes with you
Four minutes and she's everything I see
Five minutes and she's where I wanna be
Another minute, everything just feels so new
I need six minutes with you
Six minutes

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
She's looking at her watch while the DJ is spinning
This could be the end or it's just the beginning
She's the kinda girl that I wanna know better
Reaching for her keys so I guess it's now or never
I wish that I was on the radio
I'd sing her favorite song, she'd be front row at every show
This parties lame and now, I'm running out of time
I've only got six minutes if I'm gonna make her mine

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
One minute and the earth begins to shake
Two minutes and my heart begins to break
Another minute and she makes me feel brand new
That's just three minutes with you
Four minutes and she's everything I see
Five minutes and she's where I wanna be
Another minute, everything just feels so new
I need six minutes with you
Six minutes

[Bridge: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Sometimes I feel like the catcher in the rye
Sometimes I wish that I could catch her eye
Sometimes I wish that I could be that guy, that guy, that guy, that guy
Yeah
Time is passing by
I'm losing my mind
I need
One, two, three, four, five minutes with you

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
One minute and the earth begins to shake
Two minutes and my heart begins to break
Another minute and she makes me feel brand new
That's just three minutes with you
Four minutes and she's everything I see
Five minutes and she's where I wanna be
Another minute, everything just feels so new
I need six minutes with you
Six minutes

[Verse 1]
Mandy used to be that girl
The one that never said a word
But she only sang
S Club 7 and all those boy bands
Now it's been a few years
It looks like things have changed
Now she's mine and I wanna say

[Chorus]
Mandy always laughs when I act stupid
I am unaware that I'm a nuisance
With her it's never wasted time
Mandy always knows exactly what I'm
Thinking and she's always on my mind
And now, I'm never gonna let her go
'Cause Mandy always knows

[Verse 2]
Mandy always tells the truth
Even when it's hard to do
And she always understands
Even when it don't make sense
Even though she is the blonde
I'm the one that feels so dumb

[Chorus]
Mandy always laughs when I act stupid
I am unaware that I'm a nuisance
With her it's never wasted time
Oh, Mandy always knows exactly what I'm
Thinking and she's always on my mind
And now, I'm never gonna let her go
'Cause Mandy always knows

[Bridge]
When I have a problem
I'm sure that Mandy knows
When I'm feeling lonely
I'm sure that Mandy knows
When everything's crazy
She's always there for me
And I'm sure that she knows
I'm never ever gonna let her go

[Chorus]
Mandy always laughs when I act stupid
I am unaware that I'm a nuisance
With her it's never wasted time
Oh, Mandy always knows exactly what I'm
Thinking and she's always on my mind
And now, I'm never gonna let her go
'Cause Mandy always knows
Mandy always laughs when I act stupid
I am unaware that I'm a nuisance
With her it's never wasted time
Oh, Mandy always knows exactly what I'm
Thinking and she's always on my mind
And now, I'm never gonna let her go
'Cause Mandy always knows

[Verse 1]
You just don't know it
It's getting hard to say hello
You just don't know it
I'm on the edge of crossing the line
I don't wanna blow it and show it
Before you know you're mine
You just don't know it

[Chorus]
Oh, you won't see me break
Won't make that mistake, oh no
I'll just walk away
There's too much at stake right now
I go on and on
Singing this song about you
And that's what's wrong with this song

[Verse 2]
Can you feel it?
In the way I look at you
Girl, can you hear it?
I'm crying out inside
I don't wanna see you
Be near you
You're a million miles too close

[Chorus]
Oh, you won't see me break
Won't make that mistake, oh no
I'll just walk away
There's too much at stake right now
I go on and on
Singing this song about you
And that's what's wrong with this song
Whoa, that's what's wrong with this song

[Bridge]
You don't know the way I feel (The way I feel)
So I'll stay alone (Stay alone)

[Chorus]
Oh, you won't see me break
Won't make that mistake, oh no
I'll just walk away
There's too much at stake right now
I go on and on
Singing this song about you
And that's what's wrong with this song

[Outro]
That's what's wrong
That's what's wrong with this song
That's what's wrong with this song
And that's what's wrong with this song
You just don't know it

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I am what I am, I can't help myself
And if you don't like it, get with somebody else
I'll never change my ways, it's not a phase
This is how it is and this is how it's gonna stay
Because

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I am what I am, I know what I'm not
I'm not the type of guy that doesn't know what he's got
And I won't back down, won't come around
Saying that I changed 'cause that's not how it's going down

[Post-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
'Cause I know (I know, I know)
Wherever I go (I go, I go)
I know where I stand
I am what I am
Hey! hey!
I am what I am
Hey! hey!

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
I am what I am, what can I say?
I'm gonna be this way right up until my dying day
Because that's how it goes, head to my toes
And if it doesn't show, well, I just had to let you know
Because

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
I am what I am
And nobody else
And if you've got a problem, better take it somewhere else
Because I can't turn back, I'm right on track
And if you think you know, well, then you better check your facts
Because

[Post-Chorus: NIck Jonas & Joe Jonas]
'Cause I know (I know, I know)
Wherever I go (I go, I go)
I know where I stand
I am what I am
Hey! hey!
I am what I am
Hey! hey!

[Bridge: Joe Jonas]
Oh, can't you see? I'm just being me
I can't be you and I don't wanna be
Don't try to get inside my head
'Cause what you see is what you get

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I am what I am, I can't help myself
And if you don't like it, get with somebody else
I'll never change my ways, it's not a phase
This is how it is right up until my dying day

[Post-Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
And I know (I know, I know)
Wherever I go (I go, I go)
I know where I stand
I am what I am
Hey! hey!
I am what I am
Hey! hey!
I am what I am
Hey! hey!
I am what I am
Hey! hey!

[Outro]
I am what I am

[Verse 1]
She's an underdog
Lives next door to me
She's always heard you won't amount to anything
And it kills me to watch the agony beyond her eyes
Tragic the way people pass her by
But now I realize

[Chorus]
That everyone sees her
But nobody knows her
She screams in her pillow
For a better tomorrow
She hates it
But she fakes it
Watch out for that girl
One day she may change the world

[Verse 2]
She's original
Never trying to fit in
She's got a way to always go
Against the grain
Oh yeh!
Someday, they'll see how beautiful she really is
I know that last will be the first
The tables gonna turn 'cause

[Chorus]
Everyone sees her
But nobody knows her
She screams in her pillow
For a better tomorrow
She hates it
But she fakes it
Watch out for that girl
One day she may change the world

[Bridge]
Maybe she'll be in a movie
Maybe she'll be in a song, yeah
Better pay her some attention
Before she's gone

[Pre-Chorus]
She's an underdog, yeah
She means the world to me, yeah

[Chorus]
Everyone sees her
But nobody knows her
She screams in her pillow
For a better tomorrow
She hates it
She hates it
Watch out for that girl
One day she may change the world
Everyone sees her
But nobody knows her
She screams in her pillow
For a better tomorrow
She hates it
She hates it
Watch out for that girl
One day she may change the world

[Verse 1]
We had a lot of good times when we were together
And I thought we'd last forever, you and I
I.M for so long, I couldn't wait to get your phone call
Dreaming 'bout you makes me feel alright
Tonight you called me on the phone
Said you had to stay at home
Is there something I should know? Yeah

[Chorus]
I was fine 'til 7:05
'Til she walked out the door and right out of my life
If you're gone, I'll move on
But it only would have taken two seconds to say
Goodbye (Goodbye), Goodbye (Goodbye)
Goodbye, whoa-oh

[Verse 2]
The night after you're phone call
Me and friends were hanging at the mall
I was not believing what I saw, whoa
Holding hands with him and sitting closer then six inches
Hoping she's not gonna kiss him now
How can I call you a friend? You stood me up in the end
I know that it's over, yeah

[Chorus]
I was fine 'til 7:05
'Til she walked out the door and right out of my life
If you're gone, I'll move on
But it only would have taken two seconds to say
Goodbye (Goodbye), Goodbye (Goodbye)
Goodbye, whoa-oh

[Bridge]
Don't keep telling me that you're sorry now
But let me tell you how much this hurts me too
Yeah, oh

[Chorus]
I was fine 'til 7:05
'Til she walked out the door and right out of my life
If you're gone, I'll move on
But it only would have taken two seconds to say
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, whoa-oh
I was fine 'til 7:05
'Til she walked out the door and right out of my life
If you're gone, I'll move on
But it only would have taken two seconds to say
Goodbye (Goodbye), Goodbye (Goodbye)
Goodbye

[Outro]
But it only would have taken two seconds to say
Goodbye (Goodbye), Goodbye (Goodbye), whoa-oh
Goodbye

[Verse 1]
They come and go, but they don't know
That you are my beautiful
I try to come closer with you
But they all say we won't make it through

[Chorus]
But I'll be there forever
You will see that it's better
All our hopes and our dreams will come true
I will not disappoint you
I will be right there for you 'till the end
The end of time
Please be mine

[Verse 2]
I'm in and out of love with you
Trying to find if it's really true
Oh, na, na, na, na
How can I prove my love
If they all think I'm not good enough?

[Chorus]
But I'll be there forever
You will see that it's better
All our hopes and our dreams will come true
I will not disappoint you
I will be right there for you 'till the end
The end of time
Please be mine

[Bridge]
I can't stop the rain from falling
Can't stop my heart from calling you
It's calling you
I can't stop the rain from falling
Can't stop my heart from calling you
It's calling you
I can't stop the rain from falling
I can't stop my heart from calling you
It's calling you

[Chorus]
But I'll be there forever
You will see that it's better (Much better)
All our hopes and our dreams will come true (Will come true)
I will not disappoint you (Oh no)
I will be right there for you 'till the end
The end of time
Please be mine

[SHANE]
(Music)
Turn on that radio
As loud as it can go
Wanna dance until my feet can't feel the ground (Feel the ground)
Say goodbye to all my fears
One good song, they disappear
And nothin' in the world can bring me down (Bring me down)

[NATE AND JASON]
Hand-clappin', hip-shakin', heart-breakin'
There's no fakin' what you feel
When you're right at home, yeah (Yeah)

[SHANE/NATE/JASON]
Music's in my soul

It's the one thing on my mind
Music's got control
And I'm never letting go, no, no
I just wanna play my music
Woo!

[SHANE]
(Music)
Got my six-string on my back
Don't need anything but that
Everything I want is here with me (Here with me)
So forget that fancy car
I don't need to go that far
What's drivin' me is following my dreams, yeah

[NATE AND JASON]
Hand-clappin', earth-shakin', heart-breakin'
There's no fakin' what you feel
When you're on a roll, yeah (Yeah)

[NATE]
Can't imagine what it'd be like (What it'd be like)

[SHANE]
Without the sounds of all my heroes singin' all my favorite songs

[SHANE AND NATE]
So I can sing along

[NATE]
Music's in my soul
I can hear it every day

[SHANE]
And every night
It's the one thing on my mind

[SHANE/NATE/JASON]
Music's got control
And I'm never letting go, no, no
I just wanna play my music

Music's in my soul

Music's got control
And I'm never letting go, no, no

[SHANE]
Yeah!

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
I was sittin' at home watching TV all alone
I'm so tired of reruns, I've memorized this show
So I pick up the phone, call everyone I know
Said there's going to be a party, hit the music, here we go
Yeah

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
You gotta live to party, bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play our song
Are you ready to rock and roll?
Hey! hey! hey!

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
We were out on the floor, yeah, we danced the night away
Then she looked at her watch and said that it was late
Then she pulled me aside and said she couldn't stay
(I really gotta go)
But I begged her for one more song, let the music play
Yeah

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
You gotta live to party, bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play our song
Are you ready to rock and roll?
Hey! hey! hey!

[Bridge: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
I drove her home, and then she whispered in my ear
The party doesn't have to end
We can dance here

[Breakdown: Joe Jonas]
Live to party, bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play our song
Are you ready to rock and roll?

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
You gotta live to party, bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play our song
(You got to live to party, bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play our song
Are you ready to rock and roll?)
You gotta live to party, bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play our song
Are you ready to rock and roll?

[Outro: All]
Live...to...party!

[Verse 1]
Young hearts
I believe if we are not far
From becoming who we truly are
Love is on its way

Dreamers
You see everything in color
While the world is getting darker
Love is on its way

[Chorus]
So, hold on another day
Cause love is on its way
You'll find it's gonna be okay
Cause love is on its way
It's alright, you'll find
A brighter day
Cause love it on its way

[Verse 2]
Leaders
Show us how to love each other
It could help us to recover
Love is on its way
Lonely
I believe if you find me
Then together we will truly see
Love is on its way
Yeah

[Chorus]
So, hold on another day
Cause love is on its way
You'll find it's gonna be okay
Cause love is on its way
It's alright, you'll find
A brighter day
Cause love is on its way

Yeah

[Chorus]
Hold, on another day
Cause love is on its way
You'll find it's gonna be okay
Cause love is on its way
It's alright, you'll find
A brighter day
Cause love is on its way
Cause love is on its way
Cause love is on its, way

[Verse 1]
Tonight, I walked into the bedroom
You were visibly upset
Telling me I made a bad move
But I didn't do nothing
You start screaming, wake the neighbors
Now everybody's out for blood
I didn't want no confrontation
'Cause of you, that's what I've got

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, you gotta chill out 'cause baby, I don't wanna fight with you
And every battle that we fought just made us look like fools

[Chorus]
No, you can't have a World War III
If there's only one side fighting
And you know, whoa-oh
That there's lessons left to learn
Every time you attack
It doesn't drive me to fight you back
Then I know, whoa-oh
That I'll never let it be
A World War III
World War III

[Verse 2]
Now, you're rounding up your army
Turning all your troops on me
Telling lies just to feel happy
But I won't retaliate

[Chorus]
No, you can't have a World War III
If there's only one side fighting
And you know, whoa-oh
That there's lessons left to learn
Every time you attack
It doesn't drive me to fight you back
Then I know, whoa-oh
That I'll never let it be
A World War III

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, you gotta chill out 'cause baby, I don't wanna fight with you
And every battle that we fought just made us look like fools

[Chorus]
No, you can't have a World War III
If there's only one side fighting
And you know, whoa-oh
That there's lessons left to learn
Every time you attack
It doesn't drive me to fight you back
Then I know, whoa-oh
That I'll never let it be
A World War III
World War III

[Outro]
Every time you attack
It doesn't drive me to fight you back
Then I know, whoa-oh
That I'll never let it be
A World War III
World War III
World War III

[Intro]
Uh, oh, y'all know what it is
Uh, it's that Compton—ish (Woo!)

[Chorus]
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights (Yeah)
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice (Right)
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights (Ad lib)
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice (Let's go)

[Verse 1]
I'm back at it again
My city back at it with 'em
Back against the wall, K Dot, they tryna pin
But they can fuck with that pen
The shit I write is brighter than blue gems, uh
You better stay in that gym
Exercise your mind till it's strong enough to fuck with mine
Stick to my roots like Black Thought and 'em
I'm black with thoughts of Einstein
One word describing him: genius
What you know about the city I live in?
With the souls of the dead is livin'?
You don't know about our living conditions
We live righteously, we can give a fuck about your opinion
But it's more than just weed and women
Gangsters, husslers, bullet collisions
Players, pimps, who can envision?
The place where I reside where Eazy was pitchin'
Dre was 6'4 lifting, NWA had mention
Quik had the turn tables mixin'
The first ones to say fuck the system
I'm tryin' to tell you about

[Chorus]
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, yeah, homie, that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
His own street like concrete
Would best describe fit his gutter but see, I'm what's underneath
A young gun but not like your young Chris and Neef
I'm from the land of organized crime, disorderly peace
‘Cause nowadays niggas hustle when they order their piece
And worship their gun the same as their religious beliefs
The Compton shares can't forget the police
'Cause in the hood tellin' pigs no more
It be the mark of the beast
And their main aim is just the talk of the streets
But when you see 'em please be quick on your feet
That they go, watch em!
Had you for road, kill just like a possum
You could contain 'em, but there's no way that you can stop 'em
Niggas plant their seeds to be gangstas
Hoping one day they blossom
The same time, hope the system don't lock 'em
'Cause Compton raised niggas and bitches, we barely got 'em
Unless you talk about the one with the attitude problem
From Rosecrans to Central, Compton Centennial
We back, that's for my people, it's official

[Chorus]
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life

[Post-Chorus]
Let's bring it back
Back to the streets, of course
Yeah, uh, Compton, right, uh
Homie, homie

[Verse 3]
I don't know if he new around here
But it's good to know somebody if you're new around here
'Cause it ain't too safe for you to cruise around here
Niggas stick to your ass like glue around here
Take New Jersey and fit it shit, whatever you don't care
It ain't no magic trick if they make your shit disappear
The outcome is severe, and some of this casket will last a day
But I'm amazed 'cause the young boy been here for years
I've seen niggas shed blood blood tears
Hope you not try to plan for the future niggas will mute you
Had your door in the morning wake you up like roosters
Introduce you to rugers
Clock you in like Tap Judah
A nightmare on my street, it's Fred Krueger where I live
Minus the actress and the producers
Even adolenscence will shoot you over that paper
We get +Vapors+ like Biz Markie but still I'm used to
From Rose crest to central, Compton's Anthemia
We back, that's for my people, it's official

[Chorus]
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life

[Outro]
Uh, right, we back
Uh, I see, I see
I see it's me 

[?], CID, what?

[?] why Compton's me, nigga
Haha
It's for my people loneliness 

[?]

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
I make the most of all this stress
I try to live without regrets
But I'm about to break a sweat
I'm freaking out
It's like a poison in my brain
It's like a fog that blurs the sane
It's like a vine you can't untangle
I'm freaking out

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Every time I turn around
Something don't feel right

[Chorus 1: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Just might be paranoid
I'm avoiding the lines 'cause they just might split
Can someone stop the noise?
I don't know what it is, but it just don't fit
I'm paranoid
Yeah!

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
I take the necessary steps
To get some air into my chest
I'm taking all the doctor's meds
I'm still freaking out
That's why my ex is still my ex
I never trust a word she says
I'm running all the background checks
And she's freakin' out

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Every time I turn around
Something's just not right

[Chorus 2: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Just might be paranoid
I'm avoiding the lines 'cause they just might split
Can someone stop the noise?
I don't know what it is, but it just don't fit
Consider me destroyed (consider me destroyed)
I don't know how to act, 'cause I lost my head
I must be paranoid (I must be paranoid)
And I never thought it would come to this
I'm paranoid

[Bridge: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Stuck in a room of staring faces, yeah!
Caught in a nightmare, can't wake up
If you hear my cry
Running through the streets
I'm about to freak
Come and rescue me

[Chorus 2: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Just might be paranoid (Might be paranoid)
I'm avoiding the lines, 'cause they just might split
Can someone stop the noise? (Can someone stop the noise?)
I don't know what it is, but it just don't fit
Consider me destroyed (Consider me destroyed)
I don't know how to act, 'cause I lost my head
Oh, I must be paranoid (Must be paranoid)
I never thought it would come to this
I'm paranoid

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Pick up all your tears
Throw 'em in your back seat
Leave without a second glance
Somehow, I'm to blame
For this never-ending racetrack you call life

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
So turn right
Into my arms
Turn right
You won't be alone
You might fall off this track sometimes
Hope to see you on the finish line

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
You're driving all your friends out
You just be, you cannot follow
And soon, you will be on your own
Somehow, I'm to blame
For this never-ending racetrack you call life

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
So turn right (Turn right)
Into my arms
Turn right (Turn right)
You won't be alone
You might (You might) fall off this track sometime
Hope to see you at the finish line

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
I did all I could
And I gave everything
But you had to go your way
And that road was not for me

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas (Both)]
So turn right
Into my arms
Turn right
You won't be alone
You might (You might) fall off this track sometimes
Hope to see you at the finish line

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
If time was still
The sun would never, never find us
We could light up
The sky, tonight
I, could see the world through your eyes
Leave it all behind

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
If it's you and me forever
If it's you and me right now
That'd be alright
Be alright
If we chase the stars to lose our shadow
Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
So won't you fly with me?
Oh, yeah
Gotta fly with me now

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
Now, the past
Has come
And I've been given meaning
And a reason
To give, all I can
To believe, once again

[Chorus: Nick & Joe Jonas]
If it's you and me forever
If it's you and me right now
That'd be alright
Be alright
If we chase the stars to lose our shadow
Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
So, won't you fly with me?

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
Maybe you were just afraid
Knowing you were miles away
From the place where you needed to be
And that's right here with me

[Breakdown: Nick Jonas]
It's you and me forever
You and me right now
I'd be alright
If we chase the stars to lose our shadow
Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
So, won't you fly with me?

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
If it's you and me forever
If it's you and me right now
I'd be alright
Be alright
If we chase the stars to lose our shadow
Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
So won't you fly

[Outro]
Fly
Fly, with me?

[Verse 1]
I just got back from the doctor
He told me that I had a problem
But I realized it's you
I tried to scratch away the issue
All I ever get is tissues
So I can wipe away my tears, yeah

[Chorus]
Everyone's allergic to poison ivy
Everyone's allergic to poison ivy
Everybody gets the itch, everybody hates that
Everyone's allergic to poison ivy

[Verse 2]
Now, I found out you were lying
When you told me you were trying
Just to medicate the rash
Tangled vines, they are deceiving
From the lines that now are leading
To the truth I need to hear

[Chorus]
Everyone's allergic to poison ivy
Everyone's allergic to poison ivy
Everybody gets the itch, everybody hates that
Everyone's allergic to poison ivy

[Bridge]
Yeah, I break out and I start to shake
When I hear your name, I can't walk away
I just can't do it, I can't stop even if I try
Lay down my pride, I can't walk away
I get burned and I have to learn
That the court's adjourned, can't walk away
Tied up in my tangled thoughts
I'm trying, just can't walk way
Poison, poison, poison ivy

[Chorus 2]
Everyone's allergic to poison ivy
Everybody needs a little poison ivy
Everybody wants a little poison ivy
Everybody gets the itch, everybody hates that
Everybody needs a little poison ivy
Everybody gets the itch, everybody hates that
Everybody needs a little poison ivy

[Outro]
Poison ivy, poison ivy
Give me some poison, baby

[Verse 1]
Yeah, hey, baby, why you treating me bad?
Hey, darling, you're making me mad
I'm going crazy trying to figure out why you are leaving
Give me a reason

[Pre Chorus]
Say that you need me
I know you're deceiving
The lies that you're feeding will leave you alone

[Chorus]
Please don't ask me to go
I'm already gone, I'm already gone
Please just leave me alone
I'm already gone, I'm already gone
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Hey, baby, what's the matter with you?
Hey, darling, know your love isn't true
I'm going crazy trying to figure out why you are leaving
Give me a reason

[Verse 3]
Hey, baby, why you bein' a fool?
Hey, darling, always been good to you
I'm going crazy trying to figure out why you are leaving
Give me a reason

[Pre Chorus]
Say that you need me
I know you're deceiving
The lies that you're feeding will leave you alone

[Chorus]
Please don't ask me to go
I'm already gone, I'm already gone
Please just leave me alone
I'm already gone, I'm already gone
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
Yeah, hey, baby, why you treating me bad?
Hey, darling, you're making me mad
I'm going crazy trying to figure out why you are leaving
Give me a reason

[Pre Chorus]
Say that you need me
I know you're deceiving
The lies that you're feeding will leave you the feeling of misery
Baby, and terrible, scary
I need you to leave me alone

[Chorus]
Please don't ask me to go
I'm already gone, I'm already gone
Please just leave me alone
I'm already gone, I'm already gone
Oh, oh
Hey, baby

[Intro: Nick Jonas & Miley Cyrus]
Yeah
Whoa

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
No, this isn't what I wanted
I never thought it'd come this far
Thinking back to where we started
And how we lost all that we are

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
We were young and times were easy
But I could see it's not the same
I'm standing here, but you don't see me
Give it all for that to change
And I don't want to lose her
Don't wanna let her go

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus, Nick Jonas, Both]
Standing out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
'Cause I will leave you alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm
Yeah-ah-ah
Before the storm

[Verse 3: Miley Cyrus, Nick Jonas, Both]
With every strike of lightning
Comes a memory that lasts
And not a word is left unspoken
As the thunder starts to crash
Maybe I should give up

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Nick Jonas]
Standing out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
'Cause I will leave you alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus with Nick Jonas]
I'm tryna keep the lights from going out
And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart
They always say a heart is not a home
Without the one who gets you through the storm

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Nick Jonas]
Standing out in the rain
Knowing that it's really over
Please don't leave me alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold you
Like I did before the storm

[Outro: Miley Cyrus & Nick Jonas]
Yeah
Like I did before the storm

[Verse 1]
Baby girl, I'm just a bit confused
You've been acting like you've been abused
By me lately
What's going on?
All I do is treat you with respect
All the best and never nothing less
You continue to cry
And I just don't know why

[Chorus]
What did I do to your heart?
What did I do to your heart?
Did I break it apart?
Did I break it, your heart?
What did I do to your heart?
What did I do to your heart?
Did I break it apart?
Did I break it, your heart?

[Verse 2]
All I ever get is attitude
Constant never-ending bad mood
From you baby
What's going on?
All I need is just an answer please
So I can show you what you mean to me
But you continue to cry
And I just don't know why

[Chorus]
What did I do to your heart? (What did I do to your heart?)
What did I do to your heart? (What did I do to your heart?)
Did I break it apart?
Did I break it, your heart?
What did I do to your heart? (What did I do to your heart?)
What did I do to your heart? (What did I do to your heart?)
Did I break it apart?
Did I break it, your heart?

[Bridge]
(What did I do to your)
(What did I do to your) Heart?

[Chorus]
What did I do to your heart?
What did I do to your heart?
Did I break it apart?
Did I break it, your heart?
What did I do to your heart? (What did I do to your heart?)
What did I do to your heart? (What did I do to your heart?)
Did I break it apart?
Did I break it, your heart?

[Verse 1]
I got a rep for breaking hearts
Now, I'm done with superstars
And all the tears on her guitar
I'm not bitter
Now I see, everything I'd ever need
Is the girl in front of me
She's much better

[Chorus]
You, I wanna fly with you
Tear up the sky with you
You're much better
You, I wanna fight with you
Make up tonight with you
You're much better

[Verse 2]
Now, I've got some enemies
And they're all friends suddenly
BFF's eternally
But I'm not bitter
I believe that the road that people lead
Helps you find the one you need
You're much better, yeah

[Chorus]
You, I wanna fly with you
Tear up the sky with you
You're much better
You, I wanna fight with you
Make up tonight with you
You're much better
You, I wanna fly with you
Tear up the sky with you
You're much better
You, I wanna fight with you
Make up tonight with you
You're much better
You're much better, yeah

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-ho
You, you
I wanna fight with you
You, oh-oh-oh (You're much better)
You're much better, girl, oh

[Outro]
You, you, you
You're much better
You, you, you
You're much better

[Verse 1]
She walks away
Colors fade to gray
Every precious moment's now a waste
She hits the gas hoping it would pass
The red lights starts to flash
It's time to wait

[Chorus]
And black keys never looked so beautiful
And a perfect rainbow never seemed so dull
And the lights out never had this bright a glow
And the black keys
Showing me a world I never knew, no
A world I never knew

[Verse 2]
She hates the sun 'cause it proves she's not alone
And the world doesn't revolve around her soul, no
She loves the sky 'cause it validates her pride
Never lets her know when she is wrong

[Chorus]
And black keys never looked so beautiful
And a perfect rainbow never seemed so dull
And the lights out never had this bright a glow
And the black keys
Showing me a world I never knew, no
Yeah, and the walls are closing in
Don't let 'em get inside of your head
Don't let 'em get inside of your head
Don't let 'em get inside of your head
Don't let them inside

[Chorus]
And black keys never looked so beautiful
And a perfect rainbow never seemed so dull, oh
And the lights out never had this bright a glow
And the black keys
Showing me a world I never knew, no

[Outro]
Don't let 'em get (Don't let 'em get)
Inside of your head (No)
Don't let 'em get inside of your head
Don't let 'em get (Don't let 'em get)
Inside of your head
Don't let 'em get (No)
Inside of your head
Sometimes, you'll find it's better black and white

[Verse 1]
I thought I was cool
But I just looked a fool for so long
Now you're gone, now you're gone, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't speak to me
Don't speak to me, yeah

[Verse 2]
I recall all our fights
Most of all, all the times
You would lie in my arms
Now you're gone, you're gone, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't speak to me
Don't be my aim

[Chorus]
There's a lot that you don't notice
When you read between the lines
The future's out of focus
When you're blinded by the light

[Chorus 2]
It's the hope for all the hopeless
In the worst of trying times
I resort to being speechless
Cause our love won't survive

[Bridge]
Yeah, our love won't survive
Don't speak a word

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't speak to me
Don't speak to me, yeah

[Chorus]
There's a lot that you don't notice
When you read between the lines
The future's out of focus
When you're blinded by the light

[Chorus 2]
It's the hope for all the hopeless
In the worst of trying times
I resort to being speechless
Cause our love won't survive

[Verse 1]
You dream of a day when the songs that you play
Are blasting through the speakers in your car
Then it comes in a flash and you hear the crowd
Screaming out your name for the encore

[Chorus]
Livin' life, life in the fast lane
Not that bad, no one can complain
Who's to say that we won't keep it real?
Hold on tight, don't you dare let go
Now's the time to let the whole world know
You can shine bright, but still keep it real

[Verse 2]
Who could know that you'd be on the road
Selling out the tickets to your show?
When you're home, you're still the one
You were before you left to go on tour

[Chorus]
Livin' life, life in the fast lane
Not that bad, no one can complain
Who's to say that we won't keep it real? Yeah
Hold on tight, don't you dare let go
Now's the time to let the whole world know
You can shine bright, but still keep it real

[Bridge]
Did you ever think your dreams (Would become a reality?)
All you did was just believe

[Verse 3]
Livin' life, life in the fast lane
Not that bad, no one can complain
Who's to say that we won't keep it real?
Yeah

[Chorus]
Livin' life, life in the fast lane
Not that bad, no one can complain
Who's to say that we won't keep it real?
Hold on tight, don't you dare let go
Now's the time to let the whole world know
You can shine bright, but still keep it real

[Verse 1]
It was a beautiful day
I throw my worries away
Nothing new, just the same old same
So I'mma start a new page
I turn the radio on
And it's my favorite song
It's so good to sing along
And it feels so right this can't be wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
I just want a good time
Oh oh
I don't wanna fuss and fight, no
Life's too short to waste time
Oh no
Every little thing's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
'Cause we're chillin' in the summertime
Not a cloud in the sky
Everybody's feelin' fine
And everything will be alright
'Cause we're soaking up the sweet sunshine
Not a worry on my mind
Everybody's feelin' fine
And everything will be alright

[Verse 3]
There's a party tonight
Where the moon shines bright
Bring your friends and I'll bring mine
It feels so good to be alive
When the night is cool
Baby girl, there's just me and you
There's only one thing left to do
And that's play this song for you cause

[Pre-Chorus]
I just want a good time
Oh oh
I don't wanna fuss and fight, no
Life's too short to waste time
Oh no
Every little thing's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
'Cause we're chillin' in the summertime
Not a cloud in the sky
Everybody's feelin' fine
And everything will be alright
'Cause we're soaking up the sweet sunshine
Not a worry on my mind
Everybody's feelin' fine
And everything will be alright

[Bridge]
And in the morning, we gon' rise (We gon' rise)
Trials and tribulations pass us by (Pass us by)
Oooh, so don't you worry love is waiting on the other side
Every little thing's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
'Cause we're chillin' in the summertime
Not a cloud in the sky
Everybody's feelin' fine
And everything will be alright
'Cause we're soaking up the sweet sunshine
Not a worry on my mind
Everybody's feelin' fine
And everything will be alright

[Bridge]
It's gonna be alright
;Cause we're chillin' in the summertime (It's gonna be alright)
Not a cloud in the sky
Everybody's feeling fine
And everything will be alright

[Chorus]
'Cause we're chillin in the summertime
Not a cloud in the sky (Not a cloud)
Everybody's feeling fine
And everything will be alright

[Chorus: Jonas Brothers]
Hey!
This is the night!
This is the night!
Hey!
I'm feelin' alive, feelin' alive

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
My heart goes boom as the stars go blue
Like a sea of cell phone lights
The moon gets light as the sun goes down
Somewhere behind the Hollywood sign
Have you ever felt like you're living in the shadows?
Have you ever felt kept down?
I know sometimes that it feels like a battle
But it can turn around

[Chorus: Jonas Brothers]
Hey!
This is the night!
This is the night!
Hey!
I'm feelin' alive, feelin' alive

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
The kick drum starts as the boulevard
Fills up with all the boys and girls
From Jersey Town to the L.A. Crowd
They hear us all over the world
Have you ever felt like standing on a rooftop
Have you ever wanted to scream?
Everybody dance, burn it up till we blast off
Just like a rockin' machine (Yeah!)

[Chorus: Jonas Brothers]
Hey!
This is the night!
This is the night!
Hey!
I'm feelin' alive, feelin' alive

[Bridge: Joe Jonas]
'Cause we're not alone tonight
So raise up your hands and touch the sky
Cause we're not alone tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Jonas Brothers]
Hey!
This is the night!
This is the night! (Yeah)
Hey!
I'm feelin' alive, feelin' alive
Hey!
This is the night!
This is the night! (This is the night!)
Hey!
I'm feelin' alive, feelin' alive
Hey!
This is the night!
This is the night!
Hey!
I'm feelin' alive, feelin' alive

We're in the neon lights
It's just you and me together
Hollywood is the time
The stars are shining
For you and me tonight in this city
Where dreams are made of
Where dreams are made of

[Verse 3]
Dinner and a movie
One on one, the night is ours
I'm on my way

[Outro]
Where dreams are made of, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Where dreams are made of, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Where dreams are made of, come on
Where dreams are made of

[Verse 1]
Driving down the boulevard (Solo)
She pulls up in her daddy's car, top down
I said you've got friends and I've got mine
And I got nothing on my mind
Rockin' out to my favorite songs
That's all I really need
Would it be better if you rolled with me?

[Chorus]
We've got the words if you've got the melody
We've got the time if you've got the place to be
And we're not gonna stop
Until we set it off
We've got tonight to make every memory
Ready or not, 'cause we're gonna make you see
No, we're not gonna stop
We're gonna set this party off
We're gonna set this party off

[Verse 2]
She looked at me like I was so crazy
I could tell she was in 'cause she didn't say no right away
She told that she would think about it
Girls like that that gotta keep you guessing
And then she blasted her favorite song
But I still heard her scream
Ready, here we go, with me

[Chorus]
We've got the words if you've got the melody
We've got the time if you've got the place to be
And we're not gonna stop
Until we set it off
We've got tonight to make every memory
Ready or not, 'cause we're gonna make you see
No, we're not gonna stop
We're gonna set this party off

[Bridge]
All I need is my favorite song
But it sounds better when you sing along
Sing along

[Chorus]
We've got the words if you've got the melody
We've got the time if you've got the place to be
And we're not gonna stop
Until we set it off
We've got tonight to make every memory
Ready or not, 'cause we're gonna make you see
No, we're not gonna stop
We're gonna set this party off

[Outro]
We've got the words if you've got the melody, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
We've got the time if you've got the place to be, the place to be
We've got tonight to make every memory, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
No, we're not gonna stop
We're gonna set this party off
Yeah

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
Such a thrill of a lifetime
What a night for a good time
Let the beat be your lifeline
Make it feel like the first time

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Oh-oo, oh, oh-oo, oh, oh
Make it feel like the first time
Oh-oo, oh, oh-oo, oh, oh

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Come on let it set you free

So let's toast to the good life (good life), yeah, yeah

[Freestyle 1: Kanye West] (To Nick Cannon)
Ayo dog
Nicky my dog
And this is for sure
So I'm not going to break you down
Ask Christina Millian know what we did on tour
Stays on tour, and i'll tell you right now
And I like Indian girls, but I won't hurry
Last time we boned, you had the bedroom smelling like curry

[Freestyle 2: Kanye West] (To Kat Williams)
Come on boss
You were suppose to be the Pimp and Prince
I've seen you in Friday after next
And I haven't seen you since

[Freestyle 3: Kanye West]
Look it's hard for me to say shit
Cause I don't know about that gay shit
But I see you do, looking like Tiger Woods
Like lost in the hood
Looking like Bryant Gumbel
And expect me to be humble
Every time I flip a fold your goin to crumble
With them phony ass pony's
Bitch read the news
Why you always try running in the back and grab all the free shoes
So Why don't you buy somethin' ?
Why don't you try somethin' ?
Stop lying, stop fronting
Y'all niggas don't know about nothing

[Freestyle 4: Kanye West]
I could rip all of yall
In a line
With every rhyme
Yall know Kanye, is like the greatest all time
'Cause I do the Grammys, and comeback with my family
Rippin' you muthafuckers
With the mic that you hand me
You all don't understand me dawg
You still pushing camrys
Please, step back for a minute
You the Lieutenant, I'm the General
And generality killing yall
And Yeah, and I could keep it right there
Kanye ripping you niggas
This shit is unfair!
Man my shit be going off!
Pizzle!

[Hook]
Man my shit be going off!
Super early in the morning, I never felt so motherfucking important
Man my shit be going off!
Everybody wanna see me, they call me, and they text me, then they tweet me
Man my shit be going off!
What it do? Where you at? I’m coming through
Man my shit be going off!
I tell them not to bother me, don’t bother me, instead they calling me and calling me
Man my shit be going off!

[Verse : T-Pain]
7:45 on a weekday
I can rent a G5 with a week's pay
I be dizzy, I be stressing
Leave a message with my butlers: Benjamin or Felípe
If I ain’t got your number locked in
You can be expecting a text that say "WHO DIS?"
And we’re about to make this party rock shit
Put your name and your e-mail in this bitch and let's DO THIS!
Man my shit be going off a lil' bit
Texting me 911, I ain’t no officer bitch!
Saw a picture in my contact she offer the dick
If I don’t feel like talking she get a cough like I’m sick (cough)
"You sleep boy?
You tired? You need something to eat, boy?"
You know how much this data plan cost!?
I guess it cost to be the boss

[Hook]

[Verse : T-Pain]
Man I lost my phone a couple days ago
No contacts I lost like 80 hoes
Way to go
But I'm just waiting on the right call by nightfall I'ma get me some fellatio
Fuck the ratio, I got my cellphone
Ain't no hoes in here, I take my ass home
I be waiting on it
I keep them Androids hating on me. Team Apple!
They say the blacker the berry
BBMing bitches tell them start packing for Paris
We gon' be there for a while, how many bags can you carry?
Or just throw 'em in the back of the Chevy
Don't even try to call me unknown
That's how you get hung up on
That number better come across
Especially if you trying to call a boss

[Hook]

[Verse : Big K.R.I.T.]
Off the chain, off the Richter, off the scale
Off the meter when a diva dyin' to meet me, hit my cell
On the regular my cellular be jumping like a trap house
Even since I bought a crib and brung the 'Lac out
They act out but now I'm falling through to blow their back out
Text me, don't address me when I got this cash out
Call it how you want it but not collect
I don't stress over pity texts, I'm about this check
In the meantime I'ma scream down, chopper blaze
Leave your number at the beep cause I'm probably getting paid
Pistol on this plate, you can be about it, I never read about it
Most of these haters do me favors when they tweet about it
Hating on the blog cause they broads love my music
Asking for a follow just to DM that they choosing
Then I hit 'em with the digits just to keep 'em flip and moving
My cellphone 808 booming

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Every week's the same
Stuck in school, so lame
My parents say that I'm lazy
Gettin' up at 8AM's crazy
Tired of bein' told what to do
So unfair, so uncool

[Pre-Chorus]
The day's too long
And I'm holding on
'Til I hear the bell ring
'Cause that's time when we're gonna
(Time when we're gonna)

[Chorus]
Breakout, let the party start
We're gonna stay out, gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
It feels so good
To let go, oh, oh (Go, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
Hanging out's just something we like to do
My friends, and the mess we get into
These are the lessons that we choose
Not a book full of things we'll never use

[Pre-Chorus]
The day's too long
And I'm holding on
'Til I hear the bell ring
'Cause that's time when we're gonna
(Time when we're gonna)

[Chorus]
Breakout, let the party start
We're gonna stay out, gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
It feels so good
To let go, oh, oh (Go, oh, oh)

[Bridge]
Wish it would never end
Spendin' time with my friends
Oh, with my friends

[Chorus]
Breakout, let the party start
We're gonna stay out, gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
It feels so good
To let go

[Chorus]
Breakout, let the party start
We're gonna stay out, gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
It feels so good
To let go, oh, oh (Go, oh, oh)

[Intro]
(Sha, sha, sha)

[Verse 1]
I probably shouldn't say this, but at times, I get so scared
When I think about the previous relationship we shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standin' in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear, my dear

[Chorus]
The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you, oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

[Verse 2]
It's awkward and silent as I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now, your sincere apology
When you mean it, I'll believe it
If you text it, I'll delete it
Let's be clear (Clear, clear)
Oh, I'm not comin' back
You're taking seven steps here

[Chorus]
The seven things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

[Bridge]
And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention the seven that I like

[Chorus]
The seven things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine
When we're intertwined, everything's alright
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I like the most that you do
You make me love you

[Outro]
(Sha, sha)
You do, oh
Ooh, ooh (La, la, la)
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
After twelve, not so well
Won't pretend it's too soon to tell what's around this bend
No disgrace about face
Anything not to have to chase you down again

[Pre-Chorus]
You know nothing hurts like losin'
When you know it's really gone
Except for the pain of choosin' to hold too long

[Chorus]
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us, it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

[Verse 2]
A lot to say, but not today
Let the radio break the silence as we drive
A kiss goodbye, not this time
Don't remember what about this song I ever liked

[Pre-Chorus]
You know nothing hurts like losin'
When you know I'm already gone
Except for the pain of choosin' to hold too long

[Chorus]
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us, it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

[Bridge]
I thought maybe we were gettin' somewhere
But we're still nowhere at all
I watch your tail lights fading
I try, but a tear won't fall
I remember what it feels like
To know love and have it taken away
Can't think of what I've learned right now
But I'll be thanking you someday

[Chorus]
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
You know it's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us, it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

[Outro]
Let the credits start to roll
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road, be the end of the road
Will be the end of the road, be the end of the road

[Verse 1]
I come home in the morning light
My mother says, "When you gonna live your life right?"
Oh, mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones
And girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun

[Verse 2]
The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells, "What you gonna do with your life?"
Oh, daddy dear, you know you're still number one
And girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have

[Chorus]
That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh, girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun

[Post-Chorus]
Girls, they wanna, wanna have fun
Girls, they wanna have

[Verse 3]
Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun
Oh, girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have

[Chorus]
That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh, girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun

[Post-Chorus]
Girls, they wanna, wanna have fun
Girls, they wanna have

[Bridge]
They just want, they just want
They just want, they just want

[Chorus]
That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh, girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun

[Post-Chorus]
Girls, they wanna, wanna have fun
Girls, they wanna have

[Outro]
When the working, when the working
When the working day is done (Oh, girls)
Oh, when the working day is done
Oh, girls, they wanna to have fun
Girls, they wanna, wanna have fun
Girls, they wanna have
Girls, they wanna, wanna have fun
Girls, they wanna have

[Verse 1]
I been in a rut, back and forth enough
Heart like a wheel
Without you around
So uncomfortable is how it feels
Every time you're near
Trouble disappears under the ground
But when you go too far
Silver clouds'll start hanging around
And I know why

[Chorus]
Tried to run, but I keep on comin' back full circle
And I can't jump the track
Can't let you go, oh, oh, oh
Tied to one, so I keep on comin' back full circle
'Cause I know you'll come around
You'll come around

[Verse 2]
Skippin' down a broken path, how long can I last?
Please let me know
Where's the finish line?
'Cause I got to find somewhere to go
I don't wanna hear people interfere
What do they know?
What I feel inside
When I'm up all night needing you home
I don't know why

[Chorus]
Tried to run, but I keep on comin' back full circle
And I can't jump the track
Can't let you go, oh, oh, oh
Tied to one, so I keep on comin' back full circle
'Cause I know you'll come around
You'll come around
'Cause I know you'll come around
You'll come around

[Bridge]
I'll keep on runnin' 'til we meet in the middle
I'll put pride aside, and I'll give just a little
There's miles to go, but we both know that we'll make it
And I know why

[Chorus]
Tried to run, but I keep on comin' back full circle
And I can't jump the track
Can't let you go, oh
Tied to one, so I keep on comin' back full circle
'Cause I know you'll come around
You'll come around

[Outro]
Yeah, I know you'll come around
You'll come around
Yeah, I know you'll come around
You'll come around

[Verse 1]
You don't understand what it is
That makes me tick, but you wish you did
You always second guess, wonder if I'll say yes
But you just lose out every time

[Pre-Chorus]
If you only knew what I talked about
When I'm with my friends, just hanging out
Then you'd have the inside scoop on what to say, what to do
That way, when you play the game, baby, you could never lose

[Chorus]
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall?
A creepy little, sneaky little fly on the wall
All my precious secrets, yeah, you know them all
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall?

[Verse 2]
You'd love to know the things I do
When I'm with my friends, and not with you
You always second guess, wonder if there's other guys I’m flirting with
You should know by now

[Pre-Chorus]
If you were my boyfriend, I'd be true to you
If I make a promise, I'm coming through
Don't you wish that you could see me every second of the day?
That way you would have no doubt that, baby, I would never stray

[Chorus]
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall?
A creepy little, sneaky little fly on the wall
All my precious secrets, yeah, you know them all
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall?

[Bridge]
A little communication
Well, that'll go a long way
You're getting misinformation
Too much hearsay, hearsay
And what I say is
Come a little closer
And what I'm gonna say is

[Breakdown]
Don't ya?
Don't ya?
Don't ya?
Don't ya wish you were a...
Hey!

[Chorus]
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall?
A creepy little, sneaky little fly on the wall
All my precious secrets, yeah, you know them all
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall?

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna make a mistake
I'm gonna do it on purpose
I'm gonna waste my time
Cause I'm full as a tick
And I'm scratching at the surface
And what I find is mine
And when the day is done and I look back
And the fact is I had fun
Fumbling around
All the advice I shunned and I ran
Where they told me not to run
But I sure had fun
So I'm gonna fuck it up again
I'm gonna do another detour
Unpave my path
And if you wanna make sense
Whatcha lookin' at me for?
I'm no good at math
And when I find my way back
The fact is I just may stay
Or I may not

[Pre-Chorus]
I've acquired quite a taste
For a well-made mistake
I wanna make a mistake
Why can't I make a mistake?

[Chorus]
I'm always doing what I think I should
Almost always doing everybody good
Why?

[Verse 2]
Do I wanna do right?
Of course
But do I really wanna feel I'm forced to answer you?
Hell no

[Pre-Chorus]
I've acquired quite a taste
For a well-made mistake
I wanna make a mistake
Why can't I make a mistake?

[Chorus]
I'm always doing what I think I should
Almost always doing everybody good
Why?

[Verse 1]
It's been in the past for a while
I get a flash, and I smile
Am I crazy?
Still miss you, baby
It was real, it was right
But it burned too hot to survive
All that's left is all these ashes

[Chorus]
Where does love go?
I don't know
When it's all said and done
How could I be losing you forever
After all the time we spent together?
I have to know why I had to lose you
Now, you've just become
Like everything I'll never find again
At the bottom of the ocean

[Post-Chorus]
Da-da-do
Da-da-do-do
Da-da-do-do-do-do-do
Da-da-da-do-do-do-do

[Verse 2]
In a dream, you appeared
For a while, you were here
So I keep sleeping
Just to keep you with me
I'll draw a map, connect the dots
With all the memories that I got
What I'm missing, I'll keep reliving

[Chorus]
Where does love go?
I don't know
When it's all said and done
How could I be losing you forever
After all the time we spent together?
I have to know why I had to lose you
Now you've just become
Like everything I'll never find again
At the bottom of the ocean

[Spoken Interlude]
This is it
Let go
Breathe

[Bridge]
You don't have to love me for me to, baby, ever understand
Just know, I love the time that we both had
And I don't ever wanna see you sad; be happy
'Cause I don't wanna hold you
If you don't wanna tell me you love me, babe
Just know, I'm gonna have to walk away
I'll be big enough for both of us to say
Be happy

[Outro]
Da-da-do
Da-da-do-do (Be happy, be happy)
Da-da-do-do-do-do-do
Da-da-da-do-do-do-do
Be happy
Mmm
Be happy

[Verse 1]
Oh, can you take care of her?
Oh, maybe you can spare her
Several moments of your consideration
Leading up to the final destination
Oh, the earth is calling out
I wanna learn what it's all about, but
Everything I read's global warming, going green
I don't know what all this means
But it seems to be saying

[Chorus]
Wake up, America
We're all in this together
It's our home, so let's take care of it
You know that you want to
You know that you got to
Wake up, America
Tomorrow becomes a new day
And everything you do matters
Yeah, everything you do matters in some way

[Verse 2]
Stand up, I'll try if you will
Wake up, it's not a fire drill
All she needs is a little attention
Can you give her just a little attention?
Oh, it's easy to look away
But it's getting harder day by day
Everything I read's global warming, going green
I don't know what all this means
But it seems to be saying
(C'mon!)

[Chorus]
Wake up, America
We're all in this together
It's our home, so let's take care of it
You know that you want to (Wake up)
You know that you got to (Oh)
Wake up, America
Tomorrow becomes a new day
And everything you do matters
Yeah, everything you do matters in some way

[Bridge]
I know that you don't wanna hear it
Especially comin' from someone so young
But in the backseat, yeah, they wanna hear it (They wanna hear it)
So, c'mon (Turn it up)
C'mon (Turn it up)
So, c'mon (Turn it up)

[Chorus]
Wake up, America (Wake up)
We're all in this together
It's our home, so let's take care of it (It's our home)
You know that you want to (Wake up)
You know that you got to (Oh)
Wake up, America
Tomorrow becomes a new day
And everything you do matters
Yeah, everything you do matters in some way

[Verse 1]
These four walls
They whisper to me
They know a secret
I knew they would not keep
Didn't take long for the room to fill with dust
And these four walls
Came down around us

[Chorus]
Must've been something, sent me out of my head
With the words so radical and not what I meant
Now I wait for a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again

[Verse 2]
It's hard now to let you be
I won't make excuses
I've made my peace
Didn't take long for me to lose the trust
'Cause these four walls
Were not strong enough

[Chorus]
Oh, must've been something, sent me out of my head
With the words so radical and not what I meant
And now I wait for a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again

[Bridge]
Yeah, it's difficult
Watchin' us fade
Knowin' it's all my fault
My mistake
Yeah, and it's difficult
Letting you down
Knowin' it's all my fault
You're not around

[Chorus]
Must've been something, sent me out of my head
With the words so radical and not what I meant
Now I wait for a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again

[Outro]
Again
Oh, these four walls again

[Verse 1]
Wake up, here I go
Cram it all down my throat
Stomach's so full that I wish I could choke
7 a.m., my head's already in a spin
As soon as I'm out that door
Bam, it hits me like a ton of those red bricks
Can't dig myself out of this highest ditch
This madness

[Pre-Chorus]
I swear, sometimes, I can't tell
Which way is up, which way is down
It's all up in my face, need to push it away
Somebody, push it away
So all that I can hear

[Chorus]
Is a simple song
Sing along now
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

[Verse 2]
Midday sun beatin' on the concrete
Burnin' up my feet
Too many cars on the street
The noise, the red, the green
Makes me wanna scream
Five o'clock, now it's bumper on bumper on bumper
Horns honkin', nobody's looking, but everybody's talkin'
Just another day on this highway

[Pre-Chorus]
I swear, sometimes, I can't tell
Which way is up, which way is down
It's all up in my face, need to push it away
Somebody, push it away
'Cause all I wanna hear

[Chorus]
Oh, is a simple song, mmm
Sing along now
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

[Post-Chorus]
Hey
Sing along now
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Sing along
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)

[Bridge]
What I'd give to turn it off
And make it stop, make it stop
You gotta make it stop
So all that I can hear

[Chorus]
Is a simple song, mmm
Sing along now
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

[Outro]
La, la, la, la, la
La, da, da, da
La, la, la, la, la
La, da, da, da

[Verse 1]
I can honestly say
You've been on my mind
Since I woke up today, up today
I look at your photograph all the time
These memories come back to life
And I don't mind

[Chorus]
I remember when we kissed
I still feel it on my lips
The time that you danced with me
With no music playing
I remember the simple things
I remember 'til I cry
But the one thing I wish I'd forget
The memory I wanna forget
Is goodbye

[Verse 2]
I woke up this morning
And played our song
And through my tears, I sang along
I picked up the phone, and then put it down
'Cause I know I'm wasting my time
And I don't mind

[Chorus]
I remember when we kissed
I still feel it on my lips
The time that you danced with me
With no music playing
I remember the simple things
I remember 'til I cry
But the one thing I wish I'd forget
The memory I wanna forget

[Bridge]
Suddenly, my cell phone's blowing up
With your ringtone
I hesitate, but answer it anyway
You sound so alone
And I'm surprised to hear you say

[Chorus]
You remember when we kissed
You still feel it on your lips
The time that you danced with me
With no music playing
You remember the simple things
We talk 'til we cry
You said that your biggest regret
The one thing you wish I'd forget
Is saying goodbye

[Outro]
Saying goodbye
Oh, goodbye

[Verse 1]
I got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will never be tamed
I knew you were somethin' special
When you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again

[Verse 2]
I've got a way of knowin' when somethin' is right
I feel like I must've known you in another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection
When you looked in my eyes
(I can't wait)
Now I can't wait to see you again

[Chorus]
The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't wait to see you again

[Verse 3]
I got this crazy feelin' deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader, but I'm reading the signs
(That you can't wait)
That you can't wait to see me again

[Chorus]
The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't wait to see you again

[Bridge]
I got my sights set on you, and I'm ready to aim

[Chorus]
The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't wait to see you again

[Outro]
(To see you again)
(To see you again)
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't wait to see you again

[Intro]
Someday, someday, someday, oh
Someday, someday, someday, oh
Someday, someday, someday, oh
Someday, someday, someday

[Verse 1]
No boy, don't call me feisty
I worked too hard for this, oh
No boy, no boy can find me easy to resist
But you boy, you boy
I know somewhere you exist
Yeah, I'm gonna find you
Someday, someday
Someday, someday, someday

[Chorus]
I ain't gonna find you in London or Rome
Ain't gonna find you staying at home
Ain't gonna find you on the dance floor
Ain't gonna find you there for sure
I'm gonna find you if I keep living
Someday
Someday, someday, someday, someday

[Verse 2]
Hey world, are you listening? (Are you listening?)
I got so much to say
I know it is a small world, small world
But sometimes I can't find my way (My way)
And I know, I know it could happen any day
Just around the corner (Just around the corner)
I'm gonna find you someday
Someday, someday, someday, someday

[Chorus]
I ain't gonna find you in London or Rome
Ain't gonna find you staying at home
Ain't gonna find you on the dance floor
Ain't gonna find you there for sure
I'm gonna find you if I keep living
Someday
Someday, someday, someday, someday

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm gonna find you
I'm gonna find you
Someday, someday, someday, someday

[Chorus]
I ain't gonna find you in London or Rome
Ain't gonna find you staying at home
Ain't gonna find you on the dance floor
Ain't gonna find you there for sure
I'm gonna find you if I keep living
Someday
Someday, someday, someday, someday

[Outro]
I know I'm gonna find you, someday
I'm gonna find you
Someday

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
Sometimes I wonder
If everything changed, how would we make out?
And now suddenly thunder and everything's changed
There's this big dark cloud, hovering

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Trace Cyrus]
Hovering
Hovering
Hovering
(You always said that we'd make it through)
Troubling
Stumbling
Fumbling
For the words that say that I'm leaving you
I'm leaving you

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
We go through the motions like everything's settled
But it's inside out
And it makes us uncomfortable, still holding on
When there's all this doubt, hovering

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Trace Cyrus]
Hovering
Hovering
Hovering
(You always said that we'd make it through)
Troubling
Stumbling
Fumbling
For the words that say that I'm leaving you
I'm leaving you

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
And maybe we're just older
Just a little older
'Cause the fact that this is over
The fact that this is over with you's been...

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Trace Cyrus]
Hovering
Hovering
Hovering
(You always said that we'd make it through)
Troubling
Stumbling
Fumbling
For the words that say that I'm leaving you
I'm leaving you
Hovering
Hovering
Hovering
(You always said that we'd make it through)
Troubling
Stumbling
Fumbling
For the words that say that I'm leaving you
I'm leaving you

[Outro: Trace Cyrus]
You always said that we'd make it through
You always said that we'd make it through

[Verse 1]
I wouldn't know what to do with another chance
If you gave it to me
I couldn't take the embrace of a real romance
It'd race right through me

[Refrain]
I'm much better off the way things are
Much much better off, better by far, by far

[Verse 2]
I wouldn't know what to say to a gentle voice
It'd roll right past me
And if you chalk it up you'll see I don't really have a choice
So don't even ask me

[Refrain]
I'm much better off, the way things are
Much much better off, better by far, by far

[Chorus]
So keep on calling me names, keep on, keep on
And I'll keep kicking the crap till it's gone
If you keep on killing, you could get me to settle
And as soon as I settle
I bet I'll be able to move on

[Bridge]
How can I fight, when we're on the same side?
How can I fight beside you?

[Chorus]
So keep on calling me names, keep on, keep on
And I'll keep kicking the crap till it's gone
If you keep on killing, you could get me to settle
And as soon as I settle
I bet I'll be able to move on

[Chorus]
Keep on calling me names, keep on, keep on
And I'll keep kicking the crap till it's gone
If you keep on killing, you could get me to settle
And as soon as I settle
I bet I'll be able to move on

[Verse 1]
All my life is on me now
Hail the pages turning
And the future's on the bound
Hell don't know my fury

[Chorus]
You're all I need, you're all I need
You're all I need, you're all I need
You're all I need, you're all I need
You're all I need, and maybe some faith would do me good

[Verse 2]
I don't know what I'm doing, don't know, should I change my mind?
I can't decide, there's too many variations to consider
No thing I do don't do no thing but bring me more to do
It's true, I do imbue my blue unto myself, I make it bitter

[Verse 3]
Baby, lay your head on my lap one more time
Tell me you belong to me
Baby, say that it's all gonna be alright
I believe that it isn't

[Chorus]
You're all I need, you're all I need
You're all I need, you're all I need
You're all I need, you're all I need
You're all I need, and maybe some faith would do me good

[Verse 1]
Love ridden, I've looked at you
With the focus I gave to my birthday candles
I've wished on the lidded blue flames under your brow
And, baby, I wished for you

[Verse 2]
Nobody sees when you are lyin' in your bed
And I wanna crawl in with you but I cry instead
I want your warm but it will only make me colder when it's over
So I can't tonight, baby

[Chorus]
No, not "baby" anymore
If I need you, I'll just use your simple name
Only kisses on the cheek from now on
And in a little while we'll only have to wave

[Bridge]
My hand won't hold you down no more
The path is clear to follow through
I stood too long in the way of the door
And now I'm giving up on
You

[Chorus]
No, not "baby" anymore
If I need you, I'll just use your simple name
Only kisses on the cheek from now on
And in a little while we'll only have to wave

No, not "baby" anymore
If I need you, I'll just use your simple name
Only kisses on the cheek from now on
And in a little while we'll only have to wave

[Verse 1]
How many times do I have to say
To get away, get gone?
Flip your shit past another lass's
Humble dwelling
You got your game, made your shot
And you got away with a lot
But I'm not turned on
So put away that meat you're selling

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I do know what's good for me
And I've done what I could for you
But you're not benefiting
And yet I'm sitting
Singing again, sing, sing again

[Chorus]
How can I deal with this
If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it
Nothing to figure out
I gotta get him out
It's time the truth was out
That he don't give a shit about me

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I do know what's good for me
And I've done what I could for you
But you're not benefiting
And yet I'm sitting
Singing again, sing, sing again

[Chorus]
How can I deal with this
If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it
Nothing to figure out
I gotta get him out
It’s time the truth was out
That he don't give a shit about me

[Verse 2]
How many times can it escalate
Till it elevates to a place I can't breathe?
And I must decide, if you must deride
That I'm much obliged to up and go
I'll idealize, then realize
That it's no sacrifice because the price is paid
And there's nothing left to grieve
Fuckin' go

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I've done what I've could for you
And I do know what's good for me
And I'm not benefiting
Instead I'm sitting
Singing again, singing again, singing again
Sing, sing again

[Chorus]
How can I deal with this
If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it
Nothing to figure out
I gotta get him out
It's time the truth was out
That he don't give a shit about me
How can I deal with this
If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it
Nothing to figure out
I gotta get him out
It's time the truth was out
That he don't give a shit about me

[Verse 1]
So be it, I’m your crowbar
If that’s what I am so far
Until you get out of this mess
And I will pretend
That I don’t know of your sins
Until you are ready to confess
But all the time, all the time
I’ll know, I’ll know

[Verse 2]
And you can use my skin
To bury secrets in
And I will settle you down
And at my own suggestion
I will ask no questions
While I do my thing in the background
But all the time, all the time
I’ll know, I’ll know

[Breakdown]
Baby
I can't help you out
While she is still around

[Verse 3]
So for the time being, I'm being patient
And amidst this bitterness
If you'll just consider this
Even if it don’t make sense all the time
Give it time
And when the crowd becomes your burden
And you've early closed your curtain
I'll wait by the backstage door

[Verse 4]
While you try to find
The lines to speak your mind
And pry it open, hoping for an encore
And if it gets too late, for me to wait
For you to find you love me, and tell me so
It’s ok, don’t need to say it

[Verse 1]
I’ve been running in circles all day long
I’m out of breath, but I’m still going strong
I’m gonna get you, yeah, no matter what they say
You think I’m losing, but I always get my way (hey!)

[Chorus]
Don't walk away when I'm talkin' to you (hey!)
This ain’t no time for your bad attitude (hey!)
Don't give me that face
When you know I'm really down for the chase
'Cause my heart's already in it, and I'm never gonna quit it
When you finally gonna get it?
Don't walk away (when I'm talking to you)

[Verse 2]
You act, act like that I don’t have a clue
You think you know it all, but I’m so on to you
You think you figured out just how to win this game
I’m on your tracks, yeah, I know every move you make (hey!)

[Chorus]
Don't walk away when I'm talkin' to you (hey!)
This ain’t no time for your bad attitude (hey!)
Don't give me that face
When you know I'm really down for the chase
'Cause my heart's already in it, and I'm never gonna quit it
When you finally gonna get it?
Don't walk away

[Bridge]
I won't give up just like that
I'm gonna make you mine if it takes everything I have

[Chorus]
Don't walk away when I'm talkin' to you (hey!)
This ain’t no time for your bad attitude (hey!)
Don't give me that face
When you know I'm really down for the chase
'Cause my heart's already in it, and I'm never gonna quit it
When you finally gonna get it?
Don't walk away

[Interlude]
(Don't walk away when I'm talking to you)
When I'm talking to you
(This ain’t no time for your bad attitude)
Yeah

[Outro]
Don't give me that face
When you know I'm really down for the chase
'Cause my heart's already in it, and I'm never gonna quit it
When you finally gonna get it?
Don't walk away

[Verse 1]
Do me a favor
And tell me what you think about me
Tell me how you want this to be
Go out on a limb and just dream
Paint a picture
Choose your colors extra wise
Especially what you put on my mind
Imagine what it be like to touch the sky, yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Whoa-oh, your thoughts are gonna pick me up
Do you know it’s good to feel so much?

[Chorus]
Whoa, you got my head in the clouds
Whoa, you got me thinking out loud
The more you dream about me, the more that I believe
That nothing’s ever out of reach
So dream, dream, dream

[Verse 2]
I breathe your visions
They pull me through the coldest of nights
They steer me towards that moment in time
When you show me what it means for you to be mine, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Whoa, oh you're giving me the will to try
Do you know that there's happy in these eyes?

[Chorus]
Whoa, you got my head in the clouds
Whoa, you got me thinking out loud
The more you dream about me, the more that I believe
That nothing’s ever out of reach
So dream, dream, dream (ha)

[Bridge]
It's like my birthday
Every time you look at me
It's like the best thing
Every time that you dream, yeah yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Whoa oh, your thoughts are going to pick me up
Do you know it's good to feel too much?
Much

[Chorus]
Whoa, you got my head in the clouds
Whoa, you got me thinking out loud
The more you dream about me, the more that I believe
That nothing’s ever out of reach
So dream, dream

[Outro]
Dream, dream
Dream, dream
The more you dream about me, the more that I believe
That nothing’s ever out of reach
So dream, dream, dream
Dream

[Verse 1]
I can almost see it
That dream I'm dreaming, but
There's a voice inside my head saying
"You'll never reach it"
Every step I'm taking
Every move I make feels lost with no direction
My faith is shaken

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I, I gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high

[Chorus 1]
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb

[Verse 2]
The struggles I'm facing
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down, but
No, I'm not breaking
I may not know it
But these are the moments that
I'm gonna remember most, yeah
Just gotta keep going

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I, I gotta be strong
Just keep pushing on, 'cause...

[Chorus 1]
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb

[Instrumental Bridge]
Yeah

[Chorus 2]
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes you're gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb
Yeah

[Outro]
Keep on moving
Keep climbing
Keep the faith, baby
It's all about, it's all about the climb
Keep your faith, keep your faith
Whoa-ooh-oh

[Verse 1]
Don't keep me waiting, anticipating
Treating me like a fool
I got news for you
I'm turning my back
I'm dropping a bomb on you

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, you need me
Believe me, you'll be calling
You love me, you hate me
Believe me, you'll come crawling

[Chorus]
So get down and get off
Let me show you what you'll be missing
We break up, you break down
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming

[Verse 2]
Don't keep me guessing
I'm your favorite obsession
Don't give me that lame excuse
Is it me that you're messing?
It's that same old confession
You're the one with something to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
Watch out now, don't blackout
There's no doubt you can't have it
Control you, I'll own you
I'll show you, but you still can't have it

[Chorus]
So get down and get off
I'ma show you what you'll be missing
We break up, you break down
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming
So get down and get off
You're not the only one that I've been missing
We break up, you break down
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming

[Bridge]
You'll be kicking and screaming
You'll be kicking and screaming
I'm so deceiving
You'll be kicking and screaming

[Pre-Chorus]
Watch out now
You'll find out, you'll cry out
There's no one above me
I play hard, don't run far
Come back now, I really do like you

[Chorus]
So get down and get off
I'ma show you what you'll be missing
We break up, you break down
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming
So get down and get off
You're not the only one that I've been missing
We break up, you break down
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming

[Outro]
You'll be kicking and screaming
You'll be kicking and screaming
Kicking and screaming
Kicking and screaming

[Verse 1]
Seems like we're holding on forever
I gotta let it go
Time's up, you pushed me to surrender, tonight
Who knows what happens now, whatever
Wherever the wind blows
And I'm there as long as we're together
Alright

[Chorus]
Let's have the time of our lives
Like there's no one else around
Just throw your hands up high
Even when they try to take us down
We'll have the time of our lives
'Til the lights burn out
Let's laugh until we cry
Life is only what you make it now
Let's have the time of our lives

[Verse 2]
Dreamers don't care if it's right
I think I'm really into you
Restless, let's leave it all behind
Tonight
Crazy when you cross my mind
Oh, the trouble we could get into
So what? Let’s just give this a try
Alright

[Chorus]
Let's have the time of our lives
Like there's no one else around
Just throw your hands up high
Even when they try to take us down
We'll have the time of our lives
'Til the lights burn out
Let's laugh until we cry
Life is only what you make it now
Let's have the time of our lives

[Bridge]
Looking back, what are we waiting for?
Take that chance, now's all we got for sure

[Chorus]
Let's have the time of our lives
Like there's no one else around
Just throw your hands up high
Even when they try to take us down
We'll have the time of our lives
'Til the lights burn out
Let's laugh until we cry
Life is only what you make it now
Let's have the time of our lives

[Verse 1]
I'm alone, it’s just me, and I’m watching TV
And I’m always, oh so bored at home
I get up, I get out
Drive my car way downtown
Keep on calling, but you're never around
See my friends out tonight under these city lights
In the club 'til someone starts a fight
And we get in the car
Still don't know where you are
I'm so pissed off, always hanging around

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I’m so tired
You’re fired

[Chorus]
I’m so jealous, restless, relentless
That’s just me
I'm so crazy lately, come on, let it be
Don't make me beg for the things I need
You know what they say
Where there’s a will, there’s a way
Lies are free, talk is cheap

[Verse 2]
Now we're out in the street, and we're sweating the heat
And we move with the traffic and the beat
I don’t care if you choke when you light up your smoke
It’s the one thing I can call my own

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's so tragic
I'm so manic

[Chorus]
I’m so jealous, restless, relentless
That’s just me
I'm so crazy lately, come on, let it be
Don't make me beg for the things I need
You know what they say
Where there’s a will, there’s a way
Lies are free, talk is cheap

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I’m so tired
You’re fired

[Chorus]
I’m so jealous, restless, relentless
That’s just me
I'm so crazy lately, come on, let it be
Don't make me beg for the things I need
You know what they say
Where there’s a will there’s a way
Lies are free, talk is cheap

[Outro]
Talk is cheap
Yeah, lies are free and talk is cheap

[Verse 1]
Why do I just lie awake and think of you?
I need some sleep
Tomorrow I have things to do
Every time I close my eyes, I see your face
So I try to read, but all I do is lose my place

[Chorus 1]
Am I obsessed with you?
I do my best not to want you
But I do all the time
I do all the time

[Verse 2]
I just had to call you up and say hello
I know it's 3 AM
And I saw you a while ago
But I still have this aching pain to hear your voice
To know you're there
I don't seem to have any choice

[Chorus 1]
Am I obsessed with you?
I do my best not to want you
But I do all the time
I do all the time

[Bridge]
I'm so sorry, I just had to wake you up
I feel so lonely by myself
Is this the way it feels when you're in love?
Or is this something else?
Yeah

[Chorus 2]
Am I obsessed with you?
I do my best not to want you
But I do all the time
Want you all the time
Ooh, yeah, but I do all the time
I want you all the time
Am I obsessed with you?

[Intro]
R-O-C-K Mafia

[Verse 1]
Creation shows me what to do
I'm dancin' on the floor with you
And when you touch my hand
I go crazy, yeah
The music tells me what to feel
I like you now, but is it real?
By the time we say goodnight
I'll know if this is right

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I feel you (Feel you) pumping through my veins (Veins)
Am I into you (You), or is the music to blame?

[Chorus]
Who owns my heart? Is it love, or is it art?
'Cause the way you got your body moving's
Got me confused, and I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks
Who owns my heart? Is it love, or is it art?
You know I wanna believe that we're a masterpiece
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark
Who owns my heart?

[Verse 2]
The room is full but all I see is
The way your eyes just blaze through me
Like fire in the dark
We're like living art

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And it hits me like a tidal wave
Are you feeling me, or is the music to blame?

[Chorus]
Who owns my heart? Is it love, or is it art?
'Cause the way you got your body moving's
Got me confused, and I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
You know I wanna believe that we're a masterpiece
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark
Who owns my heart?

[Bridge]
So come on, baby
Keep provoking me
Keep on roping me
Like a rodeo
Baby, pull me close
C'mon, here we go, here we go, here we go

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And it hits me like a tidal wave
Are you feeling me, or is the music to blame?

[Chorus]
Who owns my heart? Is it love, or is it art?
'Cause the way you got your body moving's
Got me confused, and I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
You know I wanna believe that we're a masterpiece
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark
Who owns my heart?

[Intro]
Rock Mafia

[Verse 1]
For those who don't know me, I can get a bit crazy
Have to get my way, yep
24 hours a day, 'cause I'm hot like that
Every guy, everywhere just gives me mad attention
Like I'm under inspection
I always gets a ten, 'cause I'm built like that

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I go through guys like money flying out the hands
They try to change me, but they realize they can't
And every tomorrow is a day I never plan
If you're gonna be my man, understand

[Chorus]
I can't be tamed, I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed, I can't, can't
I can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed, I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed

[Verse 2]
If there was a question about my intentions, I'll tell ya
I'm not here to sell ya or tell you to go to hell (I'm not a brat like that)
I'm like a puzzle, but all of my pieces are jagged
If you can understand this, we can make some magic
I'm wrong like that

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go
I wanna be a part of something I don't know
And if you try to hold me back, I might explode
Baby, by now you should know

[Chorus]
I can't be tamed, I can't be tamed (I can't be tamed)
I can't be blamed, I can't, can't
I can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed, I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed

[Bridge]
Well, I'm not a trick you play
I'm wired a different way
I'm not a mistake, I'm not a fake, it's set in my DNA
Don't change me, don't change me (Ooh, oh, oh)
Don't change me, don't change me (Ooh, oh, oh)
(I can't be tamed)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go
I wanna to be a part of something I don't know
And if you try to hold me back, I might explode
Baby, by now you should know

[Chorus]
I can't be tamed, I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed, I can't, can't
I can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed, I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed

[Verse 1]
We both lie silently still in the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together, we feel miles apart inside
Was it something I said or something I did?
Did my words not come out right?
Though I tried not to hurt you
Yeah, I tried
But I guess that's why they say...

[Chorus]
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Yeah, it does

[Verse 2]
I listen to our favorite song, playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say love's a game of easy come and easy go
But I wonder, does he know?
Has he ever felt like this?
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I, I could let you know somehow

[Chorus]
Every rose has its thorn (Every rose, every rose, every rose)
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
(Every rose, every rose, every rose, yeah)
Every rose has its thorn

[Bridge]
Though it's been a while now, I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you, the wound heals
But that scar, that scar remains (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Interlude]
Every rose, every rose
Every rose has its thorn

[Verse 3]
I know I could've saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love, we both made our separate ways
And now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
And to hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife

[Chorus]
Every rose has its thorn (Every rose, every rose, every rose)
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
(Every rose, every rose, every rose, yeah)
Every rose has its thorn (Yeah, it does)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
I need to feel your heartbeat when you say you love me
I don't wanna hear it, if it's something that you don't mean
If I had to leave you now, there would be an empty space
It doesn't matter anyhow
You can take your things and go your own way

[Chorus]
And there's two more lonely people in the world tonight
Baby, you and I are just two more lonely people
Who gave up the fight
Yeah, wrong or right
Well, you know my heart is aching
You don't have to break it
If love don't change your mind
Then there's two more lonely people, tonight

[Verse 2]
I don't want the pictures, I don't want your sympathy
We don't have to be friends, we don't have to be enemies
In my head, I break it down and I'm absolutely sure
That you and I could work it out
Or we could kill the lights on what we had before

[Chorus]
And there's two more lonely people in the world tonight
Baby, you and I are just two more lonely people
Who gave up the fight
Yeah, wrong or right
Well, you know my heart is aching
You don't have to break it
If love don't change your mind
Then there's two more lonely people

[Bridge]
Well, we got something special, that should be enough
Nothing is predictable when it comes to love
Maybe lately, baby, it's been a little rough
But if you walk away tonight

[Breakdown]
We'll be two more lonely people in the world tonight
Baby, you and I are just two more lonely people
Who gave up the fight

[Chorus]
And there's two more lonely people in the world tonight
Baby, you and I are just two more lonely people
Who gave up the fight
Yeah, wrong or right
Well, you know my heart is aching
You don't have to break it
If love don't change your mind
Then there's two more lonely people, tonight

[Verse 1]
Imagining you're far away
Searching for the words to say
I feel it when you fall apart
Our lives are our greatest art

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I don't wanna change your mind
'Cause I accept you for everything you are and will be
Stay here with me now, ah

[Chorus]
The only thing that our hearts are made of
Are the acts of forgiveness and love
The only thing real, when push comes to shove
Are the acts of forgiveness and love
'Cause in the end, no one loses or wins
The story begins, again and again
With forgiveness and love

[Verse 2]
You don't ever have to read my mind
You can see it when you close your eyes
Don't believe it when you lose your faith
Another moment is a moment away

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can't tell you what the future holds or how to live
All I know is what feels right lights up my life again and again

[Chorus]
The only thing that our hearts are made of
Are the acts of forgiveness and love
The only thing real, when push comes to shove
Are the acts of forgiveness and love
'Cause in the end, no one loses or wins
The story begins, again and again
With forgiveness and love

[Bridge]
Let's jump the sun
Let's find forever
Where does the time go?
Just live your life
You'll get another today, today, today
Forgiveness and love

[Breakdown]
'Cause in the end, no one loses or wins
The story begins again and again
With forgiveness and love, mmm

[Outro]
Let's jump the sun (Sun)
Let's jump the sun (Sun)
Let's jump the sun (Sun)
Forgiveness and love, love

[Verse 1]
I've been to London, been to Paris, Australia and Rome
There's sexy boys in every city, but they're not what I want
Some got money, some got fame
Some got cars and the clothes
But if it just ain’t you, then I don't wanna know

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause baby, now I realize that I was wrong
When I said I didn't need you so
Miss you bad, so now I'm coming home
So you better leave the light on
Wait for me and just leave the light on

[Chorus]
It's been like a permanent December
So much colder than I can remember
When I get you back, this time I swear that I won't
Won't ever let you go
Won't let you go, no
Won't let you go, go, go, go
Won't let you go, no
Go, go, go, go - no, no, no, no

[Verse 2]
I've been to New York, been to L.A. and to Baton Rouge
I met a boy in every city, no one kept me amused
But don't call me a Lolita, 'cause I don't let 'em through
'Cause I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone and it's you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause baby, now I realize that I was wrong
When I said I didn't need you so
Miss you bad, so now I'm coming home
So you better leave the light on
Wait for me and just leave the light on

[Chorus]
It's been like a permanent December
So much colder than I can remember
When I get you back, this time I swear that I won't
Won't ever let you go
Won't let you go, no
Won't let you go, go, go, go
Won't let you go, no
Go, go, go, go - no, no, no, no
Won't let you go, go, go, go
Won't let you go, no
Go, go, go, go - no, no, no, no

[Bridge]
Hey, what do you say?
'Cause I been all around the world and they just ain’t the same
Hey, what do you say? (Hey, hey)
Without my baby, I go crazy and I just gotta scream (Ha!)

[Breakdown]
Now I realize that I was wrong
When I said I didn't need you so
Miss you bad, so now I'm coming home
So you better leave the light on
Wait for me and just leave the light on

[Chorus]
It's been like a Permanent December
So much colder than I can remember
When I get you back, this time I swear that I won't
Won't ever let you go
Won't let you go, no, won't let you go
It's been like a Permanent December
So much colder than I can remember
When I get you back, this time I swear that I won't
Won't ever let you go
Won't let you go, no
Won't let you go, go, go, go
Won't let you go, no
Go, go, go, go - no, no, no, no
Won't let you go, go, go, go
Won't let you go, no
Go, go, go, go - no, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Well, it's good to hear your voice
I hope you're doing fine
And if you ever wonder, I'm lonely here tonight
I'm lost here in this moment and time keeps slipping by
And if I could have just one wish, I'd have you by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh, I miss you
Oh oh, I need you

[Chorus]
And I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
It gets harder every day
Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me, I will stay
I will stay

[Verse 2]
Well, I try to live without you
And tears fall from my eyes
I'm alone and I feel empty
God, I'm torn apart inside
I look up at the stars, hoping you're doing the same
And somehow I feel closer
And I can hear you say

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh, I miss you
Oh oh, I need you

[Chorus]
And I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
It gets harder every day
Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me, I will stay
I will

[Bridge]
Stay, always stay
I never wanna lose you
And if I had to, I would choose you
So stay
Please always stay
You're the one that I hold onto
'Cause my heart would stop without you

[Chorus]
I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
It gets harder every day
Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry that it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me, I will stay
I will stay
I'll always stay
And I love you more than I did before
And I'm sorry that it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask I will stay
I will stay
I will stay

[Verse 1]
I can pretend that I don't see you
I can pretend I don't wanna hold you when you're around
When you're around
I can say that nothing was right
But we know if I looked in your eyes, I'd break down
Yeah, let's break down

[Chorus]
If I could have just one night to be with you
To make it right
To what we were and what we are is hidden in the scars
If I could take you there
I won’t let go of this, I swear
You won't have to wonder what we are
'Cause you won't have to ever look too far; it's in the scars
It's hidden in the scars

[Verse 2]
If I told you that I love you
But I'm doin' alright without you, it'd be a lie (Lie, lie)
But I could try (Try)
I'd run a thousand miles, believing
You're the only one I want to free me to break down
Yeah, let's break down

[Chorus]
If I could have just one night to be with you
To make it right
To what we were and what we are is hidden in the scars
If I could take you there
I won’t let go of this, I swear
You won't have to wonder what we are
'Cause you won't have to ever look too far; it's in the scars (Oh-oh)

[Bridge]
Yeah, I'll tell you all my secrets
All the ones I've kept inside
And I'll give you all the reasons that you faded from my life
I won't let you go, baby, come here close
I won't let you walk away

[Chorus]
If I could have just one night to be with you
To make it right
To what we were and what we are is hidden in the scars
If I could take you there
I won’t let go of this, I swear
You won't have to wonder what we are
'Cause you won't have to ever look too far; it's in the scars
It's hidden in the scars

[Breakdown]
Hidden in the scars
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
I can pretend that I don't see you
And I can pretend I don't wanna hold you when you're around

[Intro: Chris Brown]
'Til we get it
I'ma get it
'Til we get it
'Til we get it
I'ma get it
'Til we get it

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
You say all you need is consistent love
When I try, I swear it's never enough, I messed up
Maybe this thing here just ain't meant for us
Baby, you let go and I pull you back
I let go, you ain't havin' that

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]

'Til we get it, 'til we get it, I'ma get it (Turn up)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Why is it all so complicated?
Baby, this should be simple, it's drivin' me mental
But when you back it up, it really drives me crazy
And you know what I'm into
Make me forget what we arguin' about, ayy

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
We do it like rock stars (Oh)
Sexin' in my hotel room and we so loud
Higher than a smoke cloud (Oh)
Shades on, doin' 95 with the top down
I might sound crazy (Oh)
'Cause we be goin' back and forth
One minute I hate you, then I love you
That's how it is

On the low, I used to holla at his homie, uh
Fuck it, now I'm 'bout to ride him like a pony, yeah
Okay, thug prolly, yo, come polly
He wanna fuck a bad Dolly and pop Molly
I hope your pockets got a motherfuckin' pot belly
Or is it that you never ball? John Salley
He had the Rolls in the Royce, the tone in his voice
Don't want a good girl, naw, hoes is his choice
D-D-Dick on H, p-p-p-pussy on W
Mouth on open, a-a-ass on smother you

I'ma get it, I'ma get it
'Til we get it (Yeah, yeah, yeah), 'til we get it, I'ma get it

[Verse 1]
The city of angels is lonely tonight
Keep myself alive by candlelight
Say she can't love you like I do
Look me in the eyes and say it's true
I ask myself, "Is this love at all?"
When I need you most, you let me fall
I'm always here at the side of your stage
Let you live your life, pretend I'm okay

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't you know that this ain't over?
I'll be okay
I'll hold you close, we'll stay forever

[Chorus]
I, I don't understand why you're leaving me
I, I don't understand, how without you, I can't breathe
Please don't, don't leave me here
Take my hand, I'm bleeding tears
I don't understand why you can't take me with you

[Verse 2]
You can pretend I don't exist
But you see my face every time you kiss
I hope you hurt and your walls fall down
When you hear the sound that I'm okay

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't you know that this ain't over?
I'll be okay
You can't hold me down, I won't stay forever

[Chorus]
I, I don't understand why you're leaving me
I, I don't understand how without you, I can't breathe
Please don't, don't leave me here
Take my hand, I'm bleeding tears
I don't understand why you can't take me with you

[Bridge]
I watch you leave, walk away tonight
And I'm letting go for the last time
And through the tears, I say goodbye
So breathe in, breathe in, breathe in, breathe out

[Chorus]
I, I don't understand why you're leaving me
I, I don't understand how without you, I can't breathe
Please don't, don't leave me here
Take my hand, I'm bleeding tears
I don't understand why you can't take me with you

[Outro]
Don't leave me here
Please don't leave me here
I don't understand how without you, I can't breathe
Please don't, don't leave me here
Take my hand, I'm bleeding tears
I don't understand why you can't take me with you

[Verse 1]
I've been stranded on a lonely street
Got lost in the shadows
Fell hard in the battle
Heard cries and the suffering
Walked through the darkness
Left broken and heartless

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm calling out, can you hear my voice? (Voice)
I'm gonna find you through all the noise (Whoa)
You know there's nothing that I wouldn't do (Whoa)
Shine your light as I reach for you

[Chorus]
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
It's the sound that I hear, tells me not to give up
It breathes in my chest and it runs through my blood
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
Whoa, oh oh oh yeah

[Verse 2]
I've been told at least a thousand times
"It's not worth the struggle, the hurt, or the trouble"
I keep running up to these front lines
No, I won't surrender
I'll wait here forever

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Standing here with my flag held high
Can't you see that it's worth the fight?

[Chorus]
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
It's the sound that I hear, tells me not to give up
It breathes in my chest and it runs through my blood
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
Whoa, oh oh oh yeah

[Bridge]
I've marched across this battlefield
I'm screaming out, can you hear me now?
I'm holding on, I stand my ground
I'm screaming out, can you hear me now?

[Chorus]
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
It's the sound that I hear, tells me not to give up
It breathes in my chest and it runs through my blood
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
It's the sound that I hear, tells me not to give up
It breathes in my chest, it runs through my blood
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love

[Outro]
My heart beats for love, for love

You'll me amaze
I like to party

You can't control me

[Pre-Chorus 2: Miley Cyrus & Lil Jon]
I wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go
I wanna be a part of something I don't know (What?!)
And if you try to hold me back, I might explode (You can't!)

I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed

[Verse 1]
Quick draw - I'm fast on my heat
Buckle up and take a ride in my passenger seat
Put your feet to the pavement, look at my behavement
See how, the be how, and trip what I was raised with
Can't no nigga fade me, bangin' like the 80s
Had a lot of money with a handful of babies
Boy, this shit is crazy - straight from the turf
Hit the red alert and ask Mack it better work
So I slide to the spizot, right behind the lizide
And get a bag of pizot, avoid getting hizocked
Cause hizabs is on me, they want me, but I can't fold
I'm an Eastside rider, I was born to roll
Never tell to be told, never sell to be sold
On the level, what a rebel, boy, I stay in control
And I'mma let you ride with me so you can see how it goes
And we'll hit the track and let you peep out some hoes
And if you like what you see, and you agree with me
Then you enjoy my perspective of the LBC
Kick back and roll up, and mix the Henny with the soda
We ridin' like we flyin' through the system of solar
And the aroma of doja, the atmospherin' we hearin'
Since I'm the driver I'm ridin' with rear-end super suspension
The misson can't be completed 'til you get that vibe
Now you're mobbin' to the beat on the passenger side

[Hook]
Lean back, roll up, this is how it go
Windows down, music up, this is how we blow
Lean back, roll up, this is how it go
Windows down, music up, this is how we blow

[Verse 2]
We in the tre, so I'mma dip it slow
Next stop is the liquor store
Last sip, pour it back
So good, I had to get some more of that
Yeah. And now we on tizilt
Interior, mizilk - exterior, sizilk
Okay, okay, alright - say it like all day
In the tre with the dawgs, that's the player life
How you feel now?
I know - you probably want the wheel now
But I can't and I ain't, so just roll up some more of that dank
And pour some more of that drank
And hand me that CD so I can let the shit knock
Live in the drop
You can hear it when we comin', we speedin' up the block
While we're beatin' up the block, it's 'bout to go down
Slip-sliding, rip-riding with my broham, haha

[Hook x2]

[Verse 1]
What could you hope to achieve
When I'm crying and you know why?
How do you find your reasons in my deepest, darkest night?
I keep giving you up
I remember when you were my only friend
Now I'm not sure you can feel like that again
I keep giving you up

[Chorus]
And my, you know my mind's made up this time
There's no going back to find what we had
And I know there's no light here left to shine
There's no wrong where there's no right
So enough
I'm giving you up

[Verse 2]
All the things that you said
Well, you seem to forget
Dance around in my head every night
And there's a battle within that I'll never win
'Cause it's me that I'm up against
It’s my heart versus common sense
Can I give you up?

[Chorus]
And my, you know my mind's made up this time
There's no going back to find what we had
And I know there's no light here left to shine
There's no wrong where there's no right
So enough
I'm giving you up

[Bridge]
Strip the layers
Make me better
Help me get out clean
Show your colors
I'm slipping under
Help me through this, please

[Chorus]
And my, you know my mind's made up this time
There's no going back to find what we had
And I know there's no light here left to shine
There's no wrong where there's no right
So enough
I'm giving you up

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
My mind's made up
Yeah, yeah
I'm giving you up
I'm giving you up
Hey, yeah
I'm giving you up

[Chorus]
She was covered in leather and gold
21 years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair, she's out there
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn

[Verse 1]
Little Ms. Perfect
Sittin' at the train stop
Red Nike high tops
Listenin' to hip-hop
While we were waitin'
Started conversatin'
Before I got her name
Along came a train

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh
Next stop Brooklyn
Ooh
Now I'm looking

[Chorus]
She was covered in leather and gold
21 years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair, she's out there
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn

[Verse 2]
On the street kickin' rocks
Circlin' the same block
Greenpoint to Flatbush
Checkin' every corner shop
Tappin' people's shoulders
Askin' if they know her
Every day’s the same
It's back to the train

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh
Next stop Brooklyn
Ooh
I'm still lookin'

[Chorus]
She was covered in leather and gold
21 years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair, she's out there
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, I wonder, will we ever meet again?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, I wonder, will we ever meet again?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I wonder if we'll ever meet again
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I hope we do
Somewhere in Brooklyn

[Verse 1]
Levon bears his war wound like a crown
He calls his child Jesus
'Cause he likes the name
And he sends him to the finest school in town
Levon, Levon likes his money
He makes a lot, they say
Spends his days countin'
In a garage by the motorway

[Pre-Chorus]
He was born a pauper to a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times said "God is dead
And the War's begun"
Alvin Tostig has a son today

[Chorus]
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon

[Verse 2]
Levon sells cartoon balloons in town
His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day
Sits on the porch swing, watchin' them fly
And Jesus, he wants to go to Venus
Leave Levon far behind
Take a balloon and go sailin'
While Levon, Levon slowly dies

[Pre-Chorus]
He was born a pauper to a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times said "God is dead
And the War's begun"
Alvin Tostig has a son today

[Chorus]
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
Whoo! And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
Whoo! And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
These clouds aren't going nowhere, baby
Rain keeps coming down
I just thought I'd try to call you, baby
For you got too far out of town
And I hope that you get this message that I'm leaving for you
Cause I hate that you left without hearing the words that I needed you to

[Pre-Chorus]
And I hope you find it
What you're looking for
And I hope it's everything you dreamed your life could be
And so much more

[Chorus]
And I hope you're happy, wherever you are
I wanted you to know that
And nothing's going to change that
And I hope you find it

[Verse 2]
Am I supposed to hang around and wait forever?
Last words that I said
But that was nothing but a broken heart talking, baby
You know that wasn't what I meant

[Pre-Chorus]
Call me up, let me know that you got this message that I'm leaving for you
'Cause I hate that you left without hearing the words that I needed you to

[Chorus]
And I hope you find it
What you're looking for
And I hope it's everything you dreamed your life could be
And so much more
And I hope you're happy, wherever you are
I wanted you to know that
And nothing's gonna change that
And I hope you find it

[Bridge]
Whatever it is out there that you were missing here

[Chorus]
And I hope you find it
What you're looking for
And I hope it's everything you dreamed your life could be
And so much more
And I hope you're happy wherever you are
I wanted you to know that
And nothing's gonna change that
No, no, no
And I hope you find it

[Outro]
I hope you find it
Mmm, ooh

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you

[Verse 1]
Well, I know this little chapel on the boulevard, we can go
No one will know
Oh, come on, girl
Who cares if we're trashed? Got a pocket full of cash we can blow
Shots of patron
And it's on, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't say no, no, no, no, no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go, go
If you're ready, like I'm ready

[Chorus]
'Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you, oh

[Verse 2]
I'll go get a ring, let the choir bells sing, like ooh
So what you wanna do?
Let's just run, girl
If we wake up and you wanna break up, that's cool
No, I won't blame you
It was fun, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't say no, no, no, no, no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go, go
If you're ready, like I'm ready

[Chorus]
'Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you

[Bridge]
Just say, "I do..."
Tell me right now, baby
Tell me right now, baby, baby
Just say, "I do..."
Tell me right now, baby
Tell me right now, baby, baby

[Chorus]
Oh, it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you

[Chorus]
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Oh, I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can

[Verse 1]
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green

Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your skin is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

He talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene, Jolene

[Chorus]
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can

[Verse 2]
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

And you could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene, Jolene

[Chorus]
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
Jolene, Jolene

[Verse 1]
I lost myself on a cool damp night
I gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight under a lilac tree
I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see and be who I want to be
When I think more than I ought to think
And do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you

[Verse 2]
Lilac wine is sweet and heady
Like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady
Like my love
Listen me, I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she, coming near here

[Verse 3]
Lilac wine is sweet and heady
Where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unready
Where's my love?
Listen to me
Why is everything so hazy
Isn't that she, or am I just going crazy, dear?

[Verse 4]
Lilac wine is sweet and heady
Where's my love?
I, I feel unready for my love

[Chorus]
Look what they've done to my song, Ma
Look what they've done to my song
Well, it's the only thing I could do half right
And it's turning out all wrong, Ma
Look what they've done to my song

[Chorus]
Look what they've done to my brain, Ma
Look what they've done to my brain
Yeah, they picked it like a chicken bone
And they think I'm half insane, Ma
Look what they've done to my brain

[Verse]
Wish I could find a book to live in
Wish I could find a good book
Cause if I could find a real good book
I'd never have to come out and look at
Look what they've done to my song
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
And if people are buying tears
Will be rich someday, Ma
Look what they've done to my brain

But maybe I'll be alright, Ma
Yeah maybe I'll be okay
Cause if the people are buying tears
Then we'll be rich someday, Ma
Look what they've done to my song

[Chorus]
Look what they've done to my soul, Ma
Look what they've done to my soul
Yeah, they tied it in a plastic bag
And they shook me upside down, Ma
Look what they've done to my song

[Outro]
Look what they've done to my soul

[Verse 1]
Look at this stuff
Isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl, the girl who has everything?

[Verse 2]
Look at this trove
Treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Lookin' around here you'd think
Sure, she's got everything

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty
I've got whozits and whatzits galore
You want thingamabobs? I got twenty
But who cares?
No big deal
I want more

[Chorus 1]
I wanna be where the people are
I wanna see, wanna see 'em dancin'
Walkin' around on those
What to ya call 'em?
Oh, feet!
Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumpin', dancin'
Strollin' along down a
What's that word again?
Street
Up where they walk, up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wanderin' free
Wish I could be part of that world

[Verse 3]
What would I give if I could live outta these waters?
What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?
Betcha on land, they understand
Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
Proper women, sick of swimmin', ready to stand

[Chorus 2]
And ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions and get some answers
What's a fire and why does it
What's the word?
Burn
When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore above?
Out of the sea
Wish I could be part of that world

[Verse 1]
(Ooh-wee, ooh-wee, ooh-wa!)
See them fighting for power (ooh-wee, ooh-wee, ooh-wa!)
But they know not the hour (ooh-wee, ooh-wee, ooh-wa!)
So they bribing with their guns, spare-parts and money
Trying to belittle our
Integrity now
They say what we know
Is just what they teach us
And we're so ignorant
Because every time they can reach us (shoobe, doo-wa)

We're not ignorant, I mean it
And they just cannot touch us
Through the powers of the Most-High (shoobe, doo-wa)
We keep on surfacing (shoobe, doo-wa)
Through the powers of the Most-High (shoobe, doo-wa)
We keep on surviving

Yeah, this ambush in the night
Planned by society
Ambush in the night
They trying to conquer me
Ambush in the night
Anything money can bring
Ambush in the night
Planned by society
Ambush in the night

[Chorus]
You better watch out

Better not pout

[Verse]
He's making a list
And checking it twice

Oh, oh, oh, I, I was a city boy
Riding to dangers where I'd always run
A boy who had his fun
But I wouldn't have done
All the things that I have done
If I knew one day you'd come
Now, baby (now, baby) now, baby (now, baby)

[Verse 2]
Oh, oh, oh, I, I know it breaks your heart
To picture the only one you wanna love
In someone else's arms
But I wouldn't have done
All the things that I have done
If I knew one day you'd come
Now, baby (now, baby) now, baby (now, baby)

Oh baby, please, let's leave the past behind us
Behind us
So that we can go where love will find us
Yeah, will find us
I know most girls would leave me
But I know that you believe me

[Outro]
Baby, I, I wish we were seventeen
So I could give you all the innocence
That you give to me
No, I wouldn't have done
All the things that I've done
If I knew one day you'd come
If I knew one day you'd come

[Chorus: Esperanza Spaulding & Bruno Mars]
Will you still call me baby when I’m old and crazy?
When I’m old and crazy, will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same? Will you laugh the same?
Will you think I’m pretty when my hair’s grey?
Will you still call me baby when I’m old and crazy?

[Verse 1: Bruno Mars]
Will you still hold my hand when my clothes are out of style?
My teeth all ran away and I don’t have the same smile

[Chorus: Esperanza Spaulding & Bruno Mars]
Will you still call me baby when I’m old and crazy?
When I’m old and crazy, will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same? Will you laugh the same?
Will you think I’m pretty when my hair’s grey?
Will you still call me baby when I’m old and crazy?

[Verse 2: Esperanza Spaulding]
Will you still want to dance even if my hips are weak?
My ears don’t hear so well and I can’t find the beat

[Chorus: Esperanza Spaulding & Bruno Mars]
Will you still call me baby when I’m old and crazy?
When I’m old and crazy, will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same? Will you laugh the same?
Will you think I’m pretty when my hair’s grey?
Will you still call me baby when I’m old and crazy?

[Intro]
Well, I believe in love, but not the kind of screws you up, no!

[Verse 1]
I believe in time and chance
'Cause I’m not one for making plans
Well, you’ve go down in history
And that’s just what it is to me
I believe in moving on when sentimental and love is gone

[Pre-Chorus]
But if I’m crying over you
And I won’t lie, leaving’s hard to do
When you turn around, I’ll be gone
And that means goodbye

[Chorus]
I'll see you in another life
I'll see you in another life
I don’t know where I’m going
But when you turn around, I’ll be gone
And that means goodbye

[Verse 2]
I believe in love, but not the kind of breaks you up, no
I don’t regret the day I fell
Kiss to life, I wish you well

[Pre-Chorus]
But if I’m crying over you
And I won’t lie, leaving’s hard to do
When you turn around, I’ll be gone
And that means goodbye

[Chorus]
I'll see you in another life
I'll see you in another life
I don’t know where I’m going
But when you turn around, I’ll be gone
And that means goodbye

[Bridge]
Well, I know you’re full, full of good intentions, yeah
But that doesn’t change a thing 'cause I’m already out of here
Oh-oh-oh
But when you turn around, I’ll be gone
And that means goodbye

[Chorus]
I'll see you in another life, yeah oh
I'll see you in another life
I don’t know where I’m going
But when you turn around, I’ll be gone
And that means goodbye, yeah yeah
I'll see you in another life, oh
I'll see you in another life
I don’t know where I’m going
But when you turn around, I’ll be gone
And that means goodbye
I'll see you in another life
I'll see you in another life
I don’t know where I’m going
But when you turn around, I’ll be gone
And that means goodbye

[Verse 1]
One minute I'm in Central Park
Then, I'm down on Delancey Street
Said, from the Bowery to St Mark's
There’s a syncopated beat. Right

I said, Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo
I'm streetwise
I can improvise
I said, Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo
I'm street-smart
I've got New York City heart

[Chorus]
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
I may not have a dime
But I got street savoir faire
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
It's just been-BO population
And I got street savoir faire

[Verse 2]
The rhythm of the city
But once you get it down
Said, then you can own this town
You can wear the crown!

[Chorus]
Why should I worry? Tell me
Why should I care?
I Said, I may not have a dime. Oh!
But I got street savoir faire
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
It's just doo-population
And I got street savoir faire

[Bridge]
Everything goes
Everything fits
They love me at the Chelsea!
They adore me at the Ritz!

[Chorus]
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
And even when I cross that line
I got street savoir faire

[Outro]
I said, Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo
I said, Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo

[Verse 1]
I’ve seen love go by my door
It’s never been this close before
Never been so easy or so slow
Shooting in the dark too long
When something’s not right, it’s wrong
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Verse 2]
Dragon clouds so high above
I've only known careless love
It's always hit me from below
But this time around it is more correct
Right on target, so direct
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Verse 3]
Purple clover, Queen Anne's lace
Crimson hair across your face
You could make me cry, if you don't know
Can't remember what I was thinking of
You might be spoiling me with too much love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Verse 4]
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
Blue river running slow and lazy
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time

[Verse 5]
Situations have ended sad
Relationships have all been bad
Mine have been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud
But there's no way I can compare
All those scenes to this affair
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Verse 6]
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing
Staying far behind without you
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying
Make me give myself a good talking-to

[Verse 7]
I'll look for you in old Honolulu
San Francisco, Ashtabula
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know
I'll see you in the sky above
In the tall grass, in the ones I love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
Oh, you're gonna make me lonesome when you go
Oh, you're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Intro]
Hands over my head
Thinking what else could go wrong
Would of stayed in bed
How can a day be so long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Never believed that things happen for a reason
But how this turned out, removed all my doubts, so believe

[Chorus]
That for you, I do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through, led me to you
So I'd do it all over again
For you

[Verse 1]
I missed the first train, stood out in the rain all day
(Little did I know)
But I caught the next train, and there you were to sweep me away
Guess that's what I waited for

[Pre-Chorus]
Never believed that things happen for a reason
But how this turned out, removed all my doubts, so believe

[Chorus]
That for you, I do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through, led me to you
So I'd do it all over again, oh

[Bridge]
Oh, who ever thought a day gone so wrong
Could turn out so lovely
Yea, I am so glad I fine with you
Even though the day went so wrong
I wouldn't change a thing
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll do it, I'll
Do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through, led me to you
So I'd do it all over again (Yeah, yeah, oh)
Do it all over again
I would do it all over again
I would do all over again for you
All I went through, led me to you
So I would do it all over again

[Outro]
Whoever thought a day gone so wrong
Could turn out so lovely, oh
Whoever thought a day gone so wrong
Could turn out so lovely, oh

[Verse 1]
I know girl, when you look at me
You don't know how I feel
Cause I am usually so nonchalant
My feelings I conceal
But I want you to know
Oh, I want you to know

I must admit I have felt this way for more than quite a while
But I cannot hold it no longer when I see that pretty smile
Cannot wait no more
Oh, I can't wait no more

Oooh

[Chorus]
Girl, to tell you the truth
It is always been you
I am all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It is always been you
I am all about you

[Verse 2]
Maybe I am a fool for speaking up but I do not mind
Cause a girl like you will come around like
Once in a million times
So what do I do?
Tell me what do I do

And the look that you are giving me gives me hope to believe
So for you baby I will change my ways I will
Wear my heart on my sleeve
Got nothing to lose
I have got nothing to lose

[Chorus]
Oh, girl, to tell you the truth
It is always been you
I am all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It is always been you
I am all about you

[Bridge]
Girl when you smile
Not a place I would rather be
Just stay for a while
Then you will see you should be right here with me
Cause I love everything you do
That is why I have to take this time baby to tell you
Oh, and now you know
And now you know

[Chorus]
Girl, to tell you the truth
It is always been you
I am all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It is always been you
I am all about you

[Outro]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I am all about you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I am all about you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I am all about you girl
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
Once again you're home alone
Tears running from your eyes
And I'm on the outside
Knowing that you're all I want
But I can't do anything
I'm so helpless baby

[Chorus]
Everyday same old things
So used to feeling pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault
She knows better but
She can't help it
Want to tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows

[Verse 2]
You've been living this way so long
You don't know the difference
And it's killing me
'Cause you can have so much more
I'm the one you are looking for
But you close your eyes on me
So you still can't see

[Chorus]
Everyday same old things
So used to feeling pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault
She knows better but
She can't help it
Want to tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows

[Verse 3]
All she knows is the pain
In the corner of an empty home
She's still comfortable
I want her to know
It can be better than this
I can't pretend
Wish we were more than friends

[Chorus]
She knows better but
She can't help it
Want to tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal (Oh)
A heart that can't feel (Oh), it's broken (Broken)
His love is all she knows (All she knows), all she knows (All she knows), all she knows (All she knows, oh)
His love is all she knows (All she knows), all she knows (All she knows), all she knows (Damn)
His love is all she knows

[Verse 1]
Little blue houses sitting high on the mountainside
Little blue houses sitting high on the mountainside
Oh, to be high on the mountainside
Oh, to be high on the mountainside

[Chorus]
Maybe all the wolves could lose my scent
And I could stay here for a while

[Verse 2]
Little safe houses sitting high on the mountainside
Little safe houses sitting high on the mountainside
Oh, to be safe on the mountainside
Oh, to be safe on the mountainside

[Chorus]
Maybe all the wolves could lose my scent
And I could stay here for a while

[Verse 1]
Little blue houses sitting high on the mountainside
Little blue houses sitting high on the mountainside
Oh, to be high on the mountainside
Oh, to be high on the mountainside

[Chorus]
Maybe all the wolves could lose my scent
And I could stay here for a while

[Verse 1]
She wakes up in the morning
Jumps in the shower
Then rubs on her lotion
While she is wrapped in a towel
Ain't no music on, but she dance to perfection
I swear the bathrooms the club
The way she's showing to her reflection

[Break]
Every morning, I watch her from behind
But she don't know
I pretend that I'm asleep
But I don't miss a show

[Chorus]
My favorite part of the day
Is when she dance in the mirror (dance in the mirror)
There's nothing more I can say
Just watch her dance in the mirror
Dance
Oh she so cute, cute, cute
Dancing in the nude, nude, nude
Oh
My favorite part of the day
Is when she dance in the mirror, dance in the mirror

[Verse 2]
It's late in the evening
We got dinner reservations
Oh, oh
She's taking her time
But I don't mind waiting
No, no
I don't get impatient
'Cause when she gets naked
Ooh the temptation (ooh the temptation)
You make me wanna cancel all of our plans
Keep you right where you stand
Just wanna see you dance, oh

[Break]
Every morning, I watch her from behind
But she don't know
I pretend that I'm asleep
But I don't miss a show
'

[Chorus]
My favorite part of the day (part if the day)
Is when she dance (dance, dance) in the mirror (dance in the mirror)
There's nothing more I can say
Just watch her dance in the mirror (ooh)
Dance

Dancing in the nude (nude), nude (nude), nude (nude)

Daa da daa da da da da (oh)

[Chorus]
Ooh, my favorite part of the day (part if the day)

[Verse 1]
When you want to do something that is new
And it seems really, really hard to do
You feel like quitting, you feel you’re through
Well I have some advice for you

[Chorus]
Do not give up, keep on trying
You all going to make it (ah yeah) do not give up
Do not ever quit, try and try and you can do it, do not give up (yeah)

[Verse 2]
If you want to catch a ball, but you are having no luck at all
The ball hits your head, it hits your nose
It hits your belly, your chin and toes
Well try and try and try again, keep on trying and soon
You will put your hands out in the air
You will catch that ball, yes this I swear

[Chorus]
Do not give up, keep on going
You are on a boat, so keep on rowing
Do not give up, don’t ever stop
Try and try and you will come out on top, do not give up

[Verse 3]
You got yourself new roller-skates
You put them on and you feel great
Stand up, but then you fall
Do not think you can skate at all
You get back up and then you trip
You skip and tip and slip and flip
Well try and try and try some more
And soon you are skating across the floor

[Chorus]
Do not give up, keep on moving
You are going to get there just keep on grooving
Do not give up, do not pack it in
Try and try and you will win, do not give up
No no no, do not give up
No no no, do not give up
No no no, do not give up, no no
Do not give up

[Chorus 1]
Jenny, my friend, Jenny, my friend
It’s fun to pretend that we’re not in love
So we can fall into love again
Jenny, my friend, Jenny, my friend
It’s fun to pretend that we’re not in love
So we can fall into love again

[Verse]
Love is quite easy to find
When you’re unsleazy and kind
There’s a madness in your mind

[Chorus 2]
Jenny, my friend, Jenny, my friend
It’s fun to pretend that we are strangers
So we can be strange, like strangers are strange
Jenny, my friend, Jenny, my friend
It’s fun to pretend that we are strangers
So we can be strange, like strangers are strange

[Verse]
Love is quite easy to find
When you’re unsleazy and kind
There’s a madness in your mind

[Verse]
How can you love me
When you don’t like me, baby?
How can you look at me
And not see the lonely tears?

[Chorus]
And I don’t know know what went wrong
Or why I'm singing this song
Lonely tears on the ground

[Verse]
How can you love me
When you don’t like me, baby?
How can you look at me
And not see the lonely tears?

[Chorus]
And I don’t know know what went wrong
Or why I'm singing this song
Lonely tears on the ground

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse]
How can you love me
When you don’t like me, baby?
How can you look at me
And not see the lonely tears?

[Chorus]
And I don’t know know what went wrong
Or why I'm singing this song
Lonely tears on the ground

[Verse]
How can you love me
When you don’t like me, baby?
How can you look at me
And not see the lonely tears?

[Chorus]
And I don’t know know what went wrong
Or why I'm singing this song
Lonely tears on the ground

[Chorus]
My bicycle rode so smooth
Under the cars, over the stars
All of you can eat my dust
My bicycle rode so smooth
Under the cars, over the stars
All of you can eat my dust

[Verse 1]
Can I start with a goodbye?
Do I dare revisit visions
That unfolded that wretched night?
Disassociated by
Combinations that were ill-advised
And a dosage quite unwise

[Chorus]
My bicycle rode so smooth
Under the cars, over the stars
All of you can eat my dust
My bicycle rode so smooth
Under the cars, over the stars
All of you can eat my dust

[Verse 2]
Oh, it cut me down to size
What a difference between what I saw
And what was before my eyes
Was that criminal disease
That will get you taken via squad car
Right to the A&E

[Chorus]
My bicycle rode so smooth
Under the cars, over the stars
All of you can eat my dust

[Bridge]
La-la la, la-la la la
La-la la la la-la la la la la
La-la la la-la la
La-la la, la-la la la
La-la la la la-la la la la la
La-la la la-la la

[Chorus]
My bicycle rode so smooth
Under the cars, over the stars
All of you can eat my dust
My bicycle rode so smooth
Under the cars, over the stars
All of you can eat my dust

[Verse 1]
Building islands in the sky
While I'm a prisoner in my mind
Will my mommy tell me why?
Sometimes, a wrong is a right

[Chorus]
I'm a smiling alligator
And I tell lies that ring true later
So much air when we inflate a thought ballune
I'm a smiling alligator
And I tell lies that ring true later
So much air when we inflate a thought ballune

[Verse 2]
Flying out into the night
Why do I feel so uptight?
Is it darkness or the light?
Sometimes, a wrong is a right

[Chorus]
I'm a smiling alligator
And I tell lies that ring true later
So much air when we inflate a thought ballune
I'm a smiling alligator
And I tell lies that ring true later
So much air when we inflate a thought ballune
I'm a smiling alligator
And I tell lies that ring true later
So much air when we inflate a thought ballune
I'm a smiling alligator
And I tell lies that ring true later
So much air when we inflate a thought ballune

[Verse 1]
Looked like a bag of cheetos exploded
They don't wear plate armor just to stand twenty paces away

[Chorus]
Fears and judgements I'll never understand
Jello and Juggernauts quicken my heavy hand

[Verse 2]
When is the pen mightier than the sword?
Are you ambitious for getting up off the floor?

[Chorus]
Fears and judgements I'll never understand
Jello and Juggernauts quicken my heavy hand

[Verse 1]
We got pistachio riflemen
We got a leopard skin motorcade
We gotta wipe the wipers and dodge the snipers
And try to keep the rattlesnakes from fucking it up

[Chorus]
We got nerve damage
We got nerve damage
We got nerve damage
The cops musta took you down
The cops musta took you down
The cops musta took you down

[Verse 2]
Now tell you don’t breathe the cellophane
P-p-p-piss on the window pane
We gotta wipe the wipers and dodge the snipers
And try to keep the rattlesnakes from fucking it up

[Chorus]
We got nerve damage
We got nerve damage
We got nerve damage
The cops musta took you down
The cops musta took you down
The cops musta took you down

[Verse 1]
If he was a girl, could she be as evil as a boy?
Would she scramble in the dark for his eyes?

[Verse 2]
If she finds that his eyes give out nothing that she likes
Like a candle in the dark, she makes light
He is alone in the, in the cold void

[Hook]
Make him shout
Make him shout
Make him shout

[Intro]
Yeah
Haha
Haha

[Chorus]

My swag official like a referee (Yeah)
No one on the plane is stayin' fresh as me
Boy, I'm dressin' clean, denim jeans sittin' low on my waist
And haters get a cloud of smoke blown in they face
Uh, my fam beside me, fans behind me
Sorry, ma, but it's money over punani

[Verse 1]
I can't afford to breathe in this time
Nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand
Hooked back up to the cathode ray

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm better off dead, I'm better off dead
I'm better off...

[Chorus]
Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself

[Verse 2]
I wanna breathe, I wanna grow

But I'm better off dead, I'm better off dead
I'm better off...

[Chorus]
Prove yourself
Prove yourself

[Verse 1]

Yea I apologize now if I get too loud
I'm in a cloud don't want to come down
I want to feel around
And with the unexpected pleasantries
Seconds turn into minutes, minutes turn into hours
I don't want to leave

[Hook]

Every time place to be
I for you and you for me
Never had a love so tight
Lost, lost in paradise

More you give, the more received
First to come, last to leave
Never had a love so tight
Lost, lost in paradise

[Verse 2]

They tasting the sweetest of sweets
I would of sworn it was a dream state
But I'm awake it's so real baby
They came in the warm of your crease
It's been a minute since I had a taste
I can't wait til we meet again

[Hook]

[Outro]

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
I can't wait til we meet again


Thought that I lost you
Looking all over for you
Live in the moment
I just need a taste

[Repeat 2x]

[Verse]
Like a rolling stone
Like a rolling stone
Like a rolling stone
Like the FBI
And the CIA
And the BBC
B.B. King
And Doris Day
Matt Busby, dig it, dig it
Dig it, dig it, dig it

[Spoken]
That was "Can You Dig It" by Georgie Wood
And now we'd like to do "Hark the Angels Come"

[Chorus]
Got me going in circles c-circles
My heart is dizzy from you
Got me going in circles c-circles
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
You got me up at night
Feeling like
You won't come through
Got me going in circles c-circles
My heart is dizzy from you
Round and r-r-r-round we go 

[x2]
Round and r-r-r-round
I'm going in circles c-circles
Please girl!

[Verse]
I give you everything, but, it's not enough
You started being easy but lately you've made it rough (for us)
You say you need me but then turn me away
Got me oh so confused, should I leave or should I stay?
(Baby tell me what you want) A little more time
(Baby tell me what you need) Baby all your love
(How far you trying to go?) All the way
(Girl I just don't know) Make up your mind

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Chorus]
Am I in love or am I faded
Yeah yeah
I won’t know until tomorrow
Am I in love or am I faded
Yeah yeah
I don't know
Ooh oh
Ooh oh
Ooh oh
Ooh oh oh ooh
Ooh oh
Ooh oh
Ooh oh oh ooh

[Verse 1]
I don't know what it is what it is about you
But I can’t seem to take my eyes off you
Got to let you know that I'm meant to you
The later it gets I got to have you
Now that I'm at the end of the bottle
She looks like a supermodel
I think I'm ready to go oh
Give her the keys to my car
I think I fell in love with the bar
Tonight I'm not going ho-o-ome
Ooh

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
12' o'clock back at the club
And I think what happened last night is happening again
12' o'clock back at the club
And I think what happened last night is happening again
Tipsy with a girl who's not my type
But the late it gets it might be on tonight

Now that I'm at the end of the bottle
She looks like a supermodel
I think I'm ready to go oh
Give her the keys to my car
I think I fell in love with the bar
Tonight I'm not going ho-o-ome
Ooh

[Chorus]
Am I in love or am I faded
Yeah yeah
I won’t know until tomorrow
Am I in love or am I faded
Yeah yeah
I don't know
Ooh oh

[Verse 3]
Have I just had too much to drink
Or am I really feeling her
Have you ever been in a situation like this
Or am I the only one?

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Have I just had too much to drink
Or am I really feeling her
Have you ever been in a situation like this
Or am I the only one?

[Verse 1: Claude Kelly]
Feel your heart beating fast
Hold me close make it last
We knew this day would come
So take a breath leave me and
Was so scared of you leaving
Wish we could both just run
Wish we could run it off
But we can't stop time
Seems the clock is running too fast
And now I'm feeling lost
And I can't read your mind
But you don't have to ask

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
You know I wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I will wait for you
You're the only thing worth holding on to
No matter how far
Girl I can't live without my heart
I hope you come home soon, soon
Girl I will wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I wait
Wait wait wait for you oh

[Verse 2: Claude Kelly]
Our phone calls will have to do
Write you letters just to prove
You're the only thing on my mind
I know it's hard, but we'll get through
Just hold on I promise you
Soon you'll be here by my side
But we can't stop time
Seems like the clock is running way too fast
And now I'm feeling lost
And I can't read your mind
But you don't have to ask

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
You know I wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I will wait for you
You're the only thing worth holding on to
No matter how far
Girl I can't live without my heart
I hope you come home soon, soon
Girl I will wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I wait

[Bridge: Bruno Mars]
Oh, girl I wait
Feel your heart beating fast
Hold me close, make this last
We knew this day would come

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
You know I wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I will wait for you
You're the only thing worth holding on to
No matter how far
Girl I can't live without my heart
I hope you come home soon, soon
Girl I will wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I wait, wait, wait, wait for you
Girl I wait for you
Girl I wait, wait, wait, wait for you, oh

[Verse 1]
Staring from my room I see them
Holding hands wish I could be them
Lovers doing what we use to do
(But I'm stuck here alone)
That's the way it's been here lately
You're too busy now to save me
Feels like you forget I'm waiting for you

Sometimes I wish I could just let go
But I love you (I love you)
And I believe that one day you will come around
But can you tell me

[Chorus]
How do I always end up being the girl at the window
(Window, window)
I tell myself I'm not going to wait for you whenever you go
(You go, you go)
You give me your word and I always take it
You say you'll be home but you never make it
So why do I
Always end up that girl at the window (the window)
The girl at the window

[Verse 2]
I know you're working that's why you're leaving
I will never argue your reasons
If this means that you believe in them
Oh time goes on and we're growing apart
Broken promises break my heart
Please don't give me a reason to say goodbye
Sometimes I wish I could just let go
But I love you (I love you)
And I believe that one day you will come around
But can you tell me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
How can I be what you're saying
When you keep turning all the pages
Am I supposed to believe your words are true
Don't take advantage of me cause you know I won't leave you
I make sure you know I always want to see you
Whoa won't you do it for me too

[Chorus]
Oh how do I always end up being the girl at the window
(Window, window)
I tell myself I'm not going to wait for you whenever you go
(You go, you go)
You give me your word and I always take it
You say you'll be home but you never make it
So why do I
Always end up that girl at the window (the window)
The girl at the window

[Verse 1]
I don't recognize my reflection
All I see is a product of your deception
Gave you all of me without question
But you had to take advantage of a blessing
I warned you, I told you it would end this way
If you kept on playing all those childish games
But just like every other man you're all the same
Revenge is sweet I love the taste it's giving me

[Chorus]
I'm a killer on the run
You broke my heart and now you're staring down my gun
Click-clack now watch me pull this trigger just for fun
Was once a good girl now a killer on the run
K-k-killer, k-k-killer, k-k-killer
K-k-killer on the run
Killer on the run
K-k-killer on the run

[Verse 2]
Wipe those tears from your eyes it's too late
With that rag in your mouth can't tell what you say
Tied to the train tracks begging me for mercy
This is going to hurt you more than it hurts me
I warned you, I told you it would end this way
If you kept on playing all those childish games
But just like every other man you're all the same
Revenge is sweet I love the taste it's giving me

[Chorus]
I'm a killer on the run
You broke my heart and now you're staring down my gun
Click-clack now watch me pull this trigger just for fun
Was once a good girl now a killer on the run
K-k-killer, k-k-killer, k-k-killer
K-k-killer on the run
Killer on the run
K-k-killer on the run

[Bridge]
You brought this upon yourself
I loved you more than anyone else
Karma’s a bitch now shut up and take it
Look at the monster you created

You brought this up on yourself
I loved you more than anyone else
Karma’s a bitch so shut up and take it
Now I’m a monster, monster you created

Yeah

Killer on the run run run run run run run run

[Chorus]
I'm a killer on the run
You broke my heart and now you're staring down my gun
Click-clack now watch me pull this trigger just for fun
Was once a good girl now a killer on the run
K-k-killer, k-k-killer, k-k-killer
K-k-killer on the run
Killer on the run
K-k-killer on the run
Killer on the run 

[repeated]

[Outro]
Goodbye

[Click-clack]
E-eh-eh-eh
You said that I was so not afraid
You said that I was just a 

[?]
But I'm not trying my best to owe it
You told me that I'm not to follow
And you only knew what you do, babe
If you only saw what I was
But I'm not trying to bet this only
Because you can't count my own deals on it
Oh I want to touch you with the lights on
Oh I want to freak you with the light-
My lonely girl you're my only girl
This is so not your fault
You're my only girl (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Sometimes I wonder what Heaven feels like?
I hope it feels like tonight
Hope it feels like tonight!
No one ever knows what tomorrow would be like
I hope it feels like tonight
Hope it feels like tonight!

[Verse 1]
With that look upon your face
Baby I know what you're thinking about, oh!
You've got your lips along my body
And I'm not going to stop you know, oh!
You want to take me to a place
Where I can't control my face somehow, oh!
You know I'm down
So boy, you going to let me down, oh!
Oh, you got your love dripping all over me
The only thing I can say is uhuu!
I don't want to wait
Just my days
It's yours, come get it, get it!

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
The way you're getting in
I can tell you're not playing, no more!
I'm am angel in disguise
With the devil as surprise for you, oh!
There is no breaking, no stopping
Just go, go, go!
We sing 

[?] and don't take it personal!
It feels like Heaven when 

[?]
Got me screaming on the morning, oh, oh!
You've got your love tripping all over me
The only thing I can say is uhuuu
I don't want to wait
Just open up my 

[?]
It's yours, come get it, get it uhuuu

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
1, 2, 3 oh
He drives a motorcycle, tattoos everywhere
He got a long wrapped sheet, that's right my baby aren’t scared
And when he talks that talk, he can back it up, ooh
And when he comes there to it, can nobody come between our love

I know some girls like good boys
But they just move too slow
You see, I like dangerous, it gives me such a rush
That's why I won't let you go

[Chorus]
Oh no
I know loving you is so wrong
But hiding you just seems so unfair
So I'm going to take you home even though
You're my mama's worst nightmare

[Verse 2]
He drinks his Jack with no Cola, 'cause he likes to feel the burn
His middle finger to the law, no this boy will never learn
Everything wrong about him, yeah, it turns me on, oh
We live the good life, sleep all day and party all night long
I know some girls like good boys
But they just move too slow
You see, I like dangerous, it gives me such a rush
That's why I won't let you go

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Say what you want, but this boy gives me everything
He'll never hurt me or put me off, anything
Mama don't you be scared, your baby girl is grown
And now I've fallen in love

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Outro]
You may be my mama's worst nightmare
But you're my dream come true

[Intro]
Wohooo Whoooo

[Verse 1]
How do I end up in the same old place
Faced again with the same mistakes
So stubborn thinking I know what is right
But life proves me wrong every time
Taking roads that lead me nowhere
How do I expect to get there
But when, oh when will I learn to just put you first

[Chorus]
I come to you now when I need you
But why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong cause only with you can I move on
Can I move on

Oh

[Verse 2]
When I am weak it's you that makes me strong
And I know that you've been with me all along
So many times I begin to close my eyes and listen to my heart
With you life is so easy why do I make it hard
Oh taking roads that lead me nowhere how do I expect to get there when will I
Learn to just put you first

[Chorus]
Hey!
I come to you now when I need you
But why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong cause only with you can I move on

[Verse 3]
I get out of my own way, let you have your way
Cause I realize I'm no good on my own
I'm there for you, I'll serve for you
I can't live without you. No

[Chorus]
I come to you now when I need you, why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own but I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong
With only you, only you, with only you
Can I move on, can I move on, can I move on

[Intro]
Oh 

[4x]

[Verse 1]
When I was just a little boy
Barely strong enough to stand
I could always count on him
Oh

He thought me everything I know
And 'till this day it shows
He was more than just a friend (Ah ah ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
There were so many times I would doubt myself
But his words were always there to help

[Chorus]
How would it be?
Where I am?
If my father didn't tell me
To never say I can't
He'd carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you can't

Oh
Never say you can't
Oh oh oh Oh

[Verse 2]
So when last rain begins to fall
And you're out there on your own
And you can't see a thing
No no no

Just find a voice that understands
For me it was my old man
Taught me to say the words I can
Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
There were so many times I would doubt myself
But his words were always there to help

[Chorus]
How would it be?
Where I am?
If my father didn't tell me
To never say I can't
He'd carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you can't

[Bridge]
Everything he taught me would stay with me forever
No I won't forget a thing
Oh because of dad I now know myself better
And I hope I can do for him what he did for me

[Chorus]
How would it be?
Where I am?
If my father didn't tell me
To never say I can't

He'd carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you can't

[Outro]
Oh
Never say you can't
Oh
Never say you can't

[Verse 1]
Here I am again doing things I said that I wouldn't do
It's 3 am and I'm rushing out the door to see you
Waiting all day, but now you want to call me
Why do you do this to me all the time?

[Chorus]
After all the things you put me through, still I come right back
But now I know the truth, I can finally see
You only want me when you're lonely
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cos now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely

[Verse 2]
Had me fooled from the start and I quickly gave my heart
Because I loved you, loved you
But this is what happens when you're a lonely girl
With no one to turn you
Now I'm stronger, don't need you any longer
So get off your knees, your words don't mean anything
After all the things you put me through, still I come right back
But now I know the truth, I can finally see
You only want me when you're lonely
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Because now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely

Nothing's ever changing, decisions you can't make it
You just think of yourself and never me at all
If you're with your friends, you just string me along
But I won't allow it anymore, so it's time for me to move on

[Chorus]
Because I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cos now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely

[Verse 3]
I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Because now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely

[Verse 1]
It’s been so long since you been gone
And now we’re here
The music’s on
We’re feeling freaky (oh)
I want you in my bedroom
You want me closer to you
What are we doing?
Let’s get to it

I lay you down
Take off your clothes
And kiss your lips
It feels so good, ooh you’re saying more
I want to be inside you
Ooh girl you got that fire
I can’t wait no longer I just got to take control

[Pre-Chorus]
The lights in the club are turning you on
Now girl let’s pretend we both are alone
We’ll finish this up when we get home
The only thing I need from you girl

[Chorus]
Is to press your body
On my body
Do it fast, do it slow
You control the tempo
Look over your shoulder
Bring it back babe
Let me feel your body
Just (press it, press it)

My favorite place is that space between your legs and yours hips
Ooh, got me licking my lips
Want to get up on it
It’s a special thing that we be doing
F’ina be bad boy
Girl I’m doing

[?]
It aren’t no secret ’bout what it is
Come on girl serve me the dish

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
Is to press your body
On my body
Do it fast, do it slow
You control the tempo
Look over your shoulder
Bring it back babe
Let me feel your body
Just

[Chorus]
Press your body
On my body
Do it fast, do it slow
You control the tempo
Look over your shoulder
Bring it back babe
Let me feel your body
Just press

Girl you’re the only thing that I see
So don’t you take your body from me
And there’s no other place I’d rather be
Oh girl there’s something about your body, body, body
Ooh the way you shaking is so naughty, naughty, naughty
Right now we got our own little party, party, party
So good
The way you press your body on me
All I need from you

[Chorus]
Is to press your body
On my body
Do it fast, do it slow
You control the tempo
Look over your shoulder
Bring it back babe
Let me feel your body
Just

[Chorus]
Press your body
On my body
Do it fast, do it slow
You control the tempo
Look over your shoulder

Girl there’s something about your body, body, body
Oh the way you shaking is so naughty, naughty, naughty
Right now we got our own little party, party, party
So good
The way you press your body on me
All I need from you
Is to press it

[Verse 1]
Every day, I wake up next to an angel
More beautiful than words could say
They said it wouldn't work but, what did they know?
'Cause years have passed and we're still here today

[Pre-Chorus]
Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me

[Chorus]
As I stand here before my woman
I can’t fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh, how could I be so lucky?
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life

[Verse 2]
Seems like yesterday when she first said "hello"
Funny how time flies when you're in love
It took us a lifetime to find each other
It was worth the wait 'cause I finally found the one

[Pre-Chorus]
Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me

[Chorus]
As I stand here before my woman
I can’t fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh, how could I be so lucky?
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life

[Verse 1]
Oh
Oh whoa
So easy to forget our love
All of the little things we do
Like calling for no reason
Just to say the words
"Baby, I love you"

I know lately, I've been busy
But a second doesn't go by
Without you crossing my mind
It's been so long since we had time
Let's take a day & make everything right

[Chorus]
Just take my hand, fall in love with me again
Let's runaway to the place
Where love first found us
Let's runaway for the day
Don't need anyone around us
When everything in love gets so complicated
It only takes a day to change it
What I have to say can't wait
All I need is a day

[Bridge]
So let's runaway
Let's runaway, just for the day
Runaway, runaway

[Verse 2]
Girl, you've been so patient
Spending nights alone & not complaining
But I'll make it up to you
And I promise today I won't keep you waiting
Please give me this one chance
To remind you of everything we have
I won't give up I'm too much in love
And I want you to know that

[Chorus]
Just take my hand
Fall in love with me again
Let's runaway to the place
Where love first found us
Let's runaway for the day
Don't need anyone around us
When everything in love gets so complicated
It only takes a day to change it
What I have to say can't wait
All I need is a day

[Chorus]
So let's runaway for the day
And I'll give everything in this moment
And I promise to make every day just like the day
Let's runaway to the place
Where love first found us
Let's runaway for the day
Don't need anyone around us
When everything in love gets so complicated
It only takes a day to change it
What I have to say can't wait
All I need is a day
So let's runaway

[Verse 1]
We had a date, I stood you up
You tried to call, but I didn't pick up
See I forgot about our plans, please forgive me for ruining your night so many times

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry, I know you're mad
And I don't want to be like every other man that you had
So I'm stopping all the childish things
Girl, you mean too much to me
Your love is worth too much to lose

[Chorus]
Girl, I know I broke your heart
Trusting me is really hard
But watch how quick I change my ways
Starting today (today)
Starting today (today)

I know that I'm the one to blame
You say every man's the same
But watch how quick I change my ways
Starting today (today)
Starting today (today)
Girl, I'm starting today

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of playing
The kiss and make-up game
And I apologize for the man I became
If I could do it all again
I would have helped my best friend
And I would throw away all my selfish ways

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

I know that I'm the one to blame
You say every man's the same
But watch how quick I change my ways
Starting today (today)
Starting today (today)
Girl, I'm starting today

[x2]

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel like dancing the night away
Feels like just yesterday we danced for the first time
For the first time, remember our first time
Time, time, time, time, ta ta ta ta ta ta ooh

[Chorus]
Let's let the music keep our bodies awake
Feels like I'm touching you right now for the first time
For the first time, remember our first time
Time, time, time, time, ta ta ta ta ta ta ooh

[Verse 1]
I think i might explode, this tension is so cold
And all this fighting between us is really getting old
We need a magic touch, before it all blows up
We've both had enough, we've both had enough
So let's just get away, go to that special place
Where we first met and on the floor my feet were swept away
Baby it's worth a try, I believe in you and I
Only takes just one night

[Bridge]
Before we both give in
Don't let it end
Let's fall in love again

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Before we both give in
Don't let it end
Let's fall in love again
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I've been working hard so long
Seems like pain has been my only friend
My fragile heart's been done so wrong
I wondered if I'd ever heal again

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh just like all the seasons never stay the same
All around me I can feel a change (oh)

[Chorus]
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins

[Verse 2]
Yesterday has come and gone
And I've learn how to leave it where it is
And I see that I was wrong
For ever doubting I could win

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh just like all the seasons never stay the same
All around me I can feel a change (oh)

[Chorus]
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins

[Verse 3]
Life's too short to have regrets
So I'm learning now to leave it in the past and try to forget
Only have one life to live
So you better make the best of it

[Chorus]
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins

[Chorus]
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins

[Bruno Mars: Chorus]
Maybe if I jump or spread my wings
I know I've been wrong about these things
I don't care if no one else believes
I think that if you believe it then maybe we'll make it
Tonight
Oh tonight
If you believe in me like I believe in you
Tonight
Tonight
Because impossible is possible tonight

[Johnny Angel: Verse 1]
Some about the day
Some about the night
Feeling so right I can smell it in the air
Maybe it's the Gucci or the Louis that she wear
But I don't even care I like my chicks simple
Wit' a big dimple real down to earth
Not stuck up there for they man
Know when I need her she got a big booty like the cute girl Anita
Low like Kesha when she on the mic
Move on to another because she wasn't treated right
I could relate to that boy Drizzy
How did I wind up right here with you

[? ]you can achieve if you do believe
Got to chase your dreams true reality
No fantasy enjoy it while you have it
Relax and take it in
I tell as your friend your friend to the end

[Chorus]

[Johnny Angel: Verse 2]
Some about the day
Some about the night
Feeling so right I can smell it in the air
Maybe it's the Gucci or the Louis that she wear
But I don't even care I like my chicks simple
Wit' a big dimple real down to earth
Not stuck up there for they man
Know when I need her she got a big booty like the cute girl Anita
We could get together like it's New Year’s Eve
Met a lot of girls but is you what I need
I live life fast
Trying to hang on passenger
I need a companion on this campaign
Felt so much pain when the rain goes away believe in sunny days
One life to live got to be epic or I'll be Edward you can be my Bella

[Chorus]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I I I don't know why why
It seems like every other night
You pick a fight fight

This is not what lovers are supposed to do do

You tell me to go go
I start walking out out
When we both know know
What we're all about bout
We fuss fight and scream
And it’s all because of our love
But you and I both know we never giving up

[Chorus]
Every time I try to leave something tells me to turn around round round round
Cause how could I ever leave the only one that holds me down down down
Cause I know we can work it out, work it out, talk it out, talk it out stick it out stick it out ooh ooh ooh
Every time I try to leave we find a way to figure it out
That’s why I always turn around

[Verse 2]
Now wait wait before you say say
Something you know you'll take back later on today day
Sometimes you drive me crazy but I love you bay
All I ask is that you always appreciate me

You tell me to go go

When we both know know
What we're all about about
We fuss fight and scream
And it’s all because I love you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Aren’t nobody that can love me like you love me

[Chorus]
Every time I try to leave something tells me to turn around

Cause I know we can work it out, (oh) work it out, talk it out, (ooh) talk it out stick it out stick it out ooh ooh ooh
Every time I try to leave we find a way to figure it out

[Verse 1]
All alone in my room
Waiting for, for this phone to ring
She'll come home someday soon
I just know or am I imagining things
The voices in my head keep saying
(The voices in my head)
She's coming back to you

[Chorus]
Is it strange that I talk to myself (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Is it weird when I hear someone else (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
What do I do (what do I do)
There's no more you (there's no more you)
And I tell me you'll be coming home (coming home)
Is it strange I believe them again (oh oh oh)
Voices in my head
The voices, the voices, the voices
Voices in my head
The voices (oh), the voices, the voices

[Verse 2]
Someone's there at the door
This is her I just know (I just know)
I get dressed I put on a smile
Oh but I it's just the mail again (the mail again)
The playing in my mind (the playing in my mind)
Saying she'll come back this time

[Chorus]
Is it strange that I talk to myself (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Is it weird when I hear someone else (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
What do I do (what do I do)
There's no more you (there's no more you)
And I tell me you'll be coming home (coming home)
Is it strange I believe them again (oh oh oh)
Voices in my head

[Bridge]
It's going to be ok, it's going to be ok, it's going to be ok
Oh just got to get through the day
It's going to be ok, it's going to be ok, it's going to be ok
Oh I just got to get through
The voices in my head (the voices in my head)
Keep saying she's coming back to you

[Chorus]
Is it strange that I talk to myself (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Is it weird when I hear someone else (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
What do I do (what do I do)
There's no more you (there's no more you)
And I tell me you'll be coming home (coming home)
Is it strange I believe them again (oh oh oh)
Voices in my head
Oh, oh, oh (oh oh oh oh oh oh)

[Intro]
She got it she looking good
I’m just watching her move

[Verse 1]
She walks on in with her retros on
Her lips as bright as the sun
Her curves goes every which way
Got skin like porcelain
The way her hair falls down her back
Billy accents her tattoo?
(are you talking to me?)
The way her hair falls down her back
Billy accents her tattoo?
Her legs like a supermodel
She worn for them high heel shoes

[Chorus]
She got every single guy in the club just watching her move
And she don't want to dance with anyone let her do what she do
She got every single guy in the club just watching her move
And she don't want to dance with anyone let her do what she do
Just watch her get it (get it)
Just watch her move

[Verse 2]
She pulls me to the side
Tells me she wants to go
I say girl i'm yours tonight
After this i'm taking you home
First and for most i dance with you

Get you in the mood
Maybe later baby girl i’ll show you exactly how i do

[Chorus]

Just watch her get it (get it)
Just watch her get it (get it)

God baby
You look good

Watch her move
Watch her move

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Just watch her get it (get it)
Just watch her get it (get it)
Look at her get it
Just watch her
Watch her move
Ooh

[Verse 1]
You use to tell that you loved me
Yeah that's what you would say
You use to buy flowers even out on valentine’s day
You would surprise me with a dinner even though you just ate
But what happened? Baby, what happened?

[Chorus]
We've been through some changes
Like we in different places
And now you think that you can just do what you do
Without any consequences
It's not what you say but what you don't say
It's not what you do but what you don't do
It's not where we go but where we don't go
It's like I don't even know you anymore
You're just a stranger, a stranger
And I don't recognize you no more
You're just a stranger, a stranger
What happened to the man that you were before?
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh

[Verse 2]
You use to look me in my eye but now you just look away
If I pull some extra time you say that you just can't stay
Oh, if you leave me at home alone for just one more night
I promise, it's going to be the last time

[Chorus]
We've been through some changes
Like we in different places
And now you think that you can just do what you do
Without any consequences
It's not what you say but what you don't say
It's not what you do but what you don't do
It's not where we go but where we don't go
It's like I don't even know you anymore
You're just a stranger, a stranger
And I don't recognize you no more
You're just a stranger, a stranger
What happened to the man that you were before? whoa

[Verse 3]
What you want me to do (do)
I'm not gun' chase after you (you)
Tell me how can I get (get)
Back the man I first met (met)

[Chorus]
It's not what you say but what you don't say
It's not what you do but what you don't do
It's not where we go but where we don't go
It's like I don't even know you anymore
You're just a stranger (don't know you no more)
A stranger and I don't recognize you no more
You're just a stranger, a stranger
What happened to the man that you were before?

[Hook]

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shied
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me
Well, it has been a year, it does not surprise me
Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kiss me now, I know you would fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

[Verse 2]
A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
I am hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year
Maybe this year I will give it to someone special

[Chorus]
Because last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

And last Christmas
And this year
It won't be anything like, anything like

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

[Verse 1]
Please take down the mistletoe
'Cause I don't want to think about that right now
'Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me
Season's greetings, hope you're well
Well I'm doing alright
If you were wondering
Lately I can never tell

[Chorus]
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine

[Verse 2]
I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
And everybody's here, except you, baby
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold

[Chorus]
But for me it's just a lonely time
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

[Verse 3]
Merry Christmas, everybody
That'll have to be something I just say this year
I'll bet you got your mom another sweater
And were your cousins late again?
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands?

[Chorus]
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

[Outro]
You were mine

[Chorus]
Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
I have been an awful good girl, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus]
Santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue
Well I will wait up for you, dear, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah

[Verse 1]
Think of all the fun I have missed
Think of all the boys I have not kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list

[Chorus]
Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that is not a lot
I have been an angel all year, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus]
Santa, honey, there is one more thing I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine, Santa honey
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 2]
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let us see if you believe in me

[Chorus]
Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
And I do not mean on the phone, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 1]
Silent night, holy night
All is calm and all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

[Verse 2]
Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from Heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Hallelujah
Christ the Saviour is born
Christ our Saviour is born

[Verse 3]
Silent night, holy night
Son of God
Love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at thy birth
Jesus Lord at thy birth

[Outro]
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Christ the Saviour is born

[Verse 1]
What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing?
Would the song still survive without five golden rings?
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe?
What would happen if God never let it snow?
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie?
Tell me, what would you find?

[Chorus]
You'd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

[Verse 2]
What if angels did not pay attention to
All the things that we wished they would always do?
What if happiness came in a cardboard box?
Then I think there is something we all forgot
What would happen if presents all went away?
Tell me, what would you find?

[Chorus]
You'd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

[Bridge]
We get so caught up in all of it
Business and relationships
Hundred-mile-an-hour lives
And it's this time of year
And everybody's here
It seems the last thing on your mind

[Chorus]
Is that the day holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
But here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something more

[Outro]
There's gotta be more
There's gotta be more

[Verse 1]
In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said, "This time I've had enough"
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

[Chorus]
I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pouring rain
Come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

[Verse 2]
Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread

[Pre-Chorus]
So babe if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me

[Chorus]
Yeah, I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pouring rain
Come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

[Bridge]
And I'll scream out the window
I can't even look at you
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
I say, "There's nothing you can say
To make this right again, I mean it, I mean it"
What I mean is

[Chorus]
I said, "Leave," but baby, all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pouring rain
Come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

[Outro]
With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess, I need you

[Verse 1]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

[Verse 2]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Intermission]

[Verse 3]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
So may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Outro]
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Verse 1]
I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

[Chorus]
Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall

[Verse 2]
Well I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it o-over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and  jump then fall into me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

[Chorus]
Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall

[Bridge]
The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile

[Chorus]
Whoa oh, I need you, baby
Don't be afraid, please
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall, baby
Jump then fall into me, into me

[Outro]
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I shine
And every time you're here
Baby, I'll show you, I'll show you
You can jump then fall, jump then fall
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah

[Verse 1]
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you

[Pre-Chorus]
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

[Verse 2]
It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

[Bridge]
I'm caught up in you
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh-oh-oh
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, come on
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

[Outro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
And in the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, oh, come on, come on
Come on, come on, oh, oh, oh, oh
Like a million little stars spelling out your name
They're spelling out your name, oh

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
We caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"

[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest made you run and hide?
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"

[Post-Chorus]
You didn't mean it, baby
I don't think so

[Bridge]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Please back up, oh back up
Back up, baby, back up

[Chorus]
'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said, "Forever and always"
'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"

[Outro]
You didn't mean it baby
You said, "Forever and always", yeah

[Verse 1]
I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find

[Chorus]
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

[Verse 2]
I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start

[Pre-Chorus]
Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear

[Chorus]
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

[Bridge]
I've watched you so long, screamed your name
I don't know what else I can say

[Chorus]
But I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

[Outro]
I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore

[Verse 1]
This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain’t nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name

[Chorus]
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

[Verse 2]
Good morning loneliness
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row Scream your name

[Chorus]
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

[Bridge]
You played in bars, you play guitar
And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

[Chorus]
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

[Outro]
Sweet, sweet superstar
Superstar

[Verse 1]
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

[Verse 2]
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine

[Chorus]
And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

[Bridge]
And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
And your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong
And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you

[Breakdown]
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours

[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours

[Outro]
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

[Verse 1]
Last night, I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside till I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

[Verse 2]
I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
"Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you"
Not before I knew how much I had to lose

[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside till I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

[Bridge]
If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just want to see you back at my front door

[Chorus - Variation]
And I say, "Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out"
But I take it all back now

[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside till I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

[Outro]
You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you want to see now
Baby, what about the ending?
Oh, I thought you'd be here by now
Thought you'd be here by now

[Verse 1]
Tall, dark, and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say, yay
And you smile and say, "How are you?”
I say, "Just fine"
I always forget to tell you, I love you
I love you forever

[Chorus]
I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

[Verse 2]
Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say
And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day

[Chorus]
I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

[Bridge]
And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away, but I never let you go
I'm love-struck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be

[Breakdown]
Right here, wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you
'Cause I loved you from the very first day

[Chorus - Variation]
I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
Forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away
I swear, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

[Outro]
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
When you come back down

[Intro]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me

[Verse 1]
Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough

[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's aren’t nothing about you (there aren’t nothing about you)
That don't do something for me
Whoa

[Verse 2]
In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you got to do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's aren’t nothing about you (there aren’t nothing about you)
That don't do something for me

I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on

[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's aren’t nothing about you (there aren’t nothing about you)
That don't do something for me

[Chorus - Modified]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
Your dance, your drive, you make me feel alive

[Outro]
The way you talk, the way you tease
By now I think you see that
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wonder how it's going to feel
Will my first love be true and real?
Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall?
What will I do when my love comes to call?
And my daddy tells me that I light up his world
Everyday he says, darling you're my best girl
He tried to teach me from the very start
The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart

[Chorus]
Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love

[Verse 2]
I know I'm not a little girl anymore
Cause I'm feeling things I've never felt before
Sweet sensations and anticipations
Calling commotion to my emotions
And I hear the words my daddy said to me
He said be true 2 yourself & keep your spirit free
And love will find you one way or another
Be good to yourself and be good to each other

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's a run around the world
And it's moving so fast
Though I want to find
A love that's going to last
A love so strong
That I can withstand
The weight of the world
In the palm of its hand

[Chorus]
Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for this game
Am I ready for the kiss, am I ready for the stars
Am I ready for the bliss, am I ready for love

[Verse 1]
American boy, living life as it goes
Sitting on the fence posts
Living in the lie
American boy, living in the real world
Trying just to get the girl
Trying to survive

[Chorus]
The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy

[Verse 2]
Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships
Looking for the love
Suddenly rise, an American beauty
Suddenly he cheats, sent from above

[Chorus]
The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy

[Verse 3]
American boy, raising little babies
Hearing daddy maybe, I'll be like you
Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn
That's grown up, American boy

[Chorus]
The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Grandview avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy

[Verse 1]
Well, she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life
Somewhere else

After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die trying
She had one little promise she was going to keep

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

[Verse 2]
Well, it was kind of cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony
She could see the cars roll by
Out on 441
Like waves crashing on the beach
And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God, it's so painful
It's something that's so close but still so far out of reach

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Oh, take it easy now

[Outro]
Oh yeah, all right
She was an American girl

[Verse 1]
I like the way you wanted me
Every night for so long, baby
I like the way you needed me
Every time the things got rocky, yeah

[

[Pre-Chorus]
I was believing in you
Was I mistaken?
Do you mean
Do you mean what you say?
When you say our love could last forever

[Chorus]
Well, I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

[Verse 2]
I like the way you'd hold me
Every night for so long, baby
I like the way you'd sing to me
Every time the things got rocky, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I was believing in you
Was I mistaken?
Do you say
Do you say what you mean?
When you say our love could last forever

[Chorus]

Oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
You'd run around
And lead me on forever
While I stay at home
Still thinking we're together
I want our love to last forever

[Chorus]
But I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
And I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow
Now baby don't you break my heart
Slow

[Verse 1]
Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into mine
And sometimes, I think of you late at night
I don't know why

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna be somewhere where you are
I wanna be where

[Chorus]
You're here, your eyes are lookin' into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your—
I'm looking through your eyes

[Verse 2]
I wake up, I'm alive
In only a little while, I'll cry
'Cause you're my lullaby
So baby, come hold me tight 'cause I

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna be everything you need
I wanna be where

[Chorus]
You're here, your eyes are lookin' into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your—
I'm looking through your eyes

[Bridge]
Just as long as you're mine
I'll be your everything now
Let me love you, kiss you
Oh, baby, let me miss you
Let me see your, dream about, dream about
Dream about your eyes

[Outro]
Ah, ah
Beautiful eyes

[Verse 1]
All is quiet in the world tonight
Catching stars and fireflies
The summer sings a lullaby
With just me and my baby
On the hood of his daddy's car
Pass around his old guitar
Bet mama's wondering where we are
It's just me and my baby
The world is spinning round
Cause look just what I've found

[Chorus]
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

[Verse 2]
Driving home by the river side
Wishing I could slow down time
Taking pictures in my mind
Both me and my baby
The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
Back roads was a better way
For me and my baby
The closer that we get
Oh, I can't leave yet

[Chorus]
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

[Bridge]
Look at what we've found
So turn that car around

[Chorus]
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Ooh, hanging with my baby
Hanging with my baby, my baby

[Verse 1]
I live down the street in a broken down house
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet, there was never a doubt
That we won't forget this Sunday
It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
And it all leads to this - our first kiss

[Chorus]
All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off
You're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

[Verse 2]
We drive around town in a rusty old truck
Somehow it feels like we're flying
Don't want to come down
But they make it so tough
Cause everyone we know is trying
To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
And they get what they want cause you're gone

[Chorus]
All my friends are saying
Girl, why are you crying?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

[Verse 3]
You come to my door
In the pouring rain
We know what we don't have to say
You hand me a rose and a note that says
We don't have to do things their way

[Chorus]
All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
Well, they can talk forever, they just don't know better

[Verse 1]
Here you are now
Fresh from your war
Back from the edge of time
And all that you were
Stripped to the bone
I thought you'd want to know

[Chorus]
That when you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless
Breathless

[Verse 2]
Lay down your guns
Too weak to run
Nothing can harm you here
Your precious heart
Broken and scarred
Somehow you made it through
I only ask that you won't go again

[Chorus]
When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

[Bridge]
I'm so glad to see you smiling
So good to hear your laugh
I think that you've found you even
Missed yourself
I'm only asking this because I think that
Truth be told
Oh, you'll never go again
Again, again

[Chorus]
When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless
Breathless

[Outro]
When you feel the world is crashing
Come running into my arms

[Verse 1]
My problem isn't that I miss you
'Cause I don't
My problem isn't that I kissed you, whoa
I figured out
That you're nothing that I thought you're about
You're just caught in a place
That soon time will erase in my heart

[Chorus]
You're my type of guy, I guess
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High for the rest of my life
But people change, thank God I did
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you

[Verse 2]
Your problem's not for lack of trying
'Cause you do
It's just that you're at your best when you're lying, whoa-oh
Now you're standing here
And saying things you think I wanted to hear
But you've got it all wrong, I've already moved on, my dear

[Chorus]
You're my type of guy, I guess
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High for the rest of my life
But people change, thank God I did
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you

[Bridge]
When you're standing near me
I don't see so clearly
The feelings are still palpable
But when I take two steps away
It sheds some light on my day
Yeah, you can't go back, it's all in the past
Guess you got to laugh at it

[Chorus]
You're my type of guy, I guess
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High for the rest of my life
But people change, thank God I did
And if there's some confusion
Let me tell you, you're just delusional, get a clue
'Cause people change, thank God I did
Thank God I did
Thank God I did

[Outro]
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you, doesn't mean I like you
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Rock 'n roll
Rock 'n…

[Intro]
The weekend's almost done
The moon is low in the sky
I feel like goin' out
Before the night passes by, I won't just sit around
When life becomes a drag
I dance

[Verse 1]
I like the bass (Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
I like the boom (Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
I need guitar (Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
I like that drum when it goes
Boom da-boom da-bum

[Chorus]
Let's dance
What the weekend, what the night is all about
Let's dance
Grab your girlfriends, grab your boyfriends, sweat it out
Let's dance
Move your whole body, and let's start the party
Too much rock for one girl can make her go crazy
I need somebody to dance with me, baby (Dance)

[Verse 2]
The music's on (Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
My favorite song (Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
The beat is strong (Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
We'll dance
C'mon! (Ow)

[Chorus]
Let's dance
What the weekend, what the night is all about
Let's dance
Grab your girlfriends (Oh, yeah), grab your boyfriends, sweat it out
Let's dance
Move your whole body, and let's start the party
Too much rock for one girl can make her go crazy
I need somebody to dance with me, baby (Dance)

[Bridge]
Keep movin'
Back it up
Yeah
When the night says hello
Yeah, get ready to go
Turn it up, turn it loose
Yeah, you got no excuse
Just take a chance (Just take a chance)
Get out on the floor and dance (Let's dance)

[Chorus]
Let's dance
What the weekend, what the night is all about (Dance with me)
Let's dance
Grab your girlfriends, grab your boyfriends, sweat it out
Let's dance (Let's dance)
And let's start the party
(Dance with me, dance with me)
(Dance with me, dance)

[Chorus]
Let's dance (Let's dance)
What the weekend, what the night is all about (Is all about)
Let's dance
Grab your girlfriends, grab your boyfriends, sweat it out
Let's dance
Move your whole body, and let's start the party
As soon as my album goes number one
Mr. Lind, I'd like a Rolex with forty diamonds (Ha)

[Verse 1]
Emily comes home from school
Grabs onto her daddy's hand
He says "Baby girl, what's wrong with you?"
She says "Please don't make me go back there again"
She said "I wish there was some way to make them stop it"
So he drives down to that principal's office and says

[Chorus]
"I didn't bring her up so they could cut her down
I didn't bring her here so they could shut her out
I live my whole damn life to see that little girl's smile
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
She wasn't brought up that way"

[Verse 2]
Emily's home late again
He sees that boy drive away
Oh, but something's different this time
She doesn't have too much to say
She said "He tried but there's just some things I won't do"
And through the tears she said "I couldn't do that to you"
And he said

[Chorus]
"I didn't bring you up so he could wear you down
Take that innocent heart and turn it inside out
I live my whole damn life to see my little girl's smile
So don't let nobody take that away
You weren't brought up that way"

[Verse 3]
The phone rings on a rainy night, says "It's Officer Tate"
He said "Sir, there's been an accident
You better come down here right away
A drunken driver missed an overpass
And Emily, she's fading fast"
He says "God, I didn't bring her up to watch them lay her down
Nearly killed me the day they put her own momma in the ground
Only thing that kept me alive was that little girl's smile
So please don't take that away, it won't be easy taking her today
She wasn't brought up that way"

[Outro]
He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyes

[Verse 1]
I had to catch my breath
When I saw you there across the room, holding her hand
I'd have never guessed that starting over would look so good on you
But here I am
Still believing there might come a day
We'll pick up where we left off

[Chorus]
And by the way your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way my heart's still breaking
It's going to take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say
By the way

[Verse 2]
I should've let you know all the ways you made me feel alive
I guess it's too late
So I'll just get my coat and make my way into this breezy night
Give you one last wave
Maybe you'll drop what you're doing and come over here to say
I'm looking good

[Chorus]
But by the way your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way my heart's still breaking
It's going to take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say

[Outro]
By the way, you still look amazing
And I must've been crazy to let you get away
By the way, if you ever wondered
Still got the same old number, just in case
I still miss you and I still love you
By the way
By the way, oh

[Verse 1]
Any day now, they're talking war
I can see the look that's in your eyes
They're not talking a week or two
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?

[Verse 2]
You pack a suitcase, take a picture from the wall
I always knew this time would come
When I ask how long you think you're going to be
You say, this crazy world's come undone

[Verse 3]
Summer's over and leaves begin to fall
And another winter's on the way
I knew I wasn't going to take this very well
But I'd give anything to have you here today

[Verse 4]
Everyday now they're talking war
& I know this time is like it's never been before
We're not talking about a week or two

[Outro]
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?

[Verse 1]
I drive around this town
In a Mustang with the top down
And six running horses under my hood
Well that’s good enough for me
Don’t need the real thing
That’s just another thing
For me to try to tame
Don’t know if I could
It might just break me
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset I’d be riding off with him

[Chorus]
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That’s the closest to a cowboy
You’ll see me

[Verse 2]
Before I met him
I was so sane and grounded
Before he taught me how to lie
And crawl out the window
I learned the dirt roads
And I got my heart broken
Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And how to let go
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset I’d be riding off with him

[Chorus]
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That’s the closest to a cowboy
You’ll see me

[Bridge]
It was all a little
Wonderful and strange
But I’ll never look
At a sunset the same night

[Chorus]
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Sitting fishing by the river bank
Swimming in the water tank
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That’s the closest to a cowboy
You’ll see me

[Verse 1]
I'd never gone with the wind, just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
'Til you open the door, there's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was tryin' to fly but I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything

[Chorus]
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

[Verse 2]
I've watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me somethin' that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes
And you made me believe

[Chorus]
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier, oh

[Bridge]
Baby, you showed me what livin' is for
I don't wanna hide anymore
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
Crazier, crazier

[Verse 1]
Don't call me, leave me alone
Not gonna answer my phone
'Cause I don't, no, I won't see you
I'm out to have a good time
To get you off of my mind
'Cause I don't and I won't need you

[Pre-Chorus]
(Hoo, hoo) Send out a 9-1-1
(Hoo, hoo) We're gonna have some fun
(Hoo, hoo) Hey boy, you know you better run

[Chorus]
'Cause it's a girls night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out
And play out, without you
You better hold tight
This girls night's without you

[Post-Chorus]
(Hoo, hoo) Let's go, G.N.O
(Hoo, hoo) Let's go, G.N.O
(Hoo, hoo) Let's go, G.N.O, let's go
It's a girls night

[Verse 2]
I'll dance with somebody new
Won't have to think about you
And who knows where they go will lead to

[Pre-Chorus]
(Hoo, hoo) You'll hear from everyone
(Hoo, hoo) You'll get the 4-1-1
(Hoo, hoo) Hey boy, you knew this day would come

[Chorus]
'Cause it's a girls night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out
And play out, without you

[Post-Chorus]
(Hoo, hoo) Let's go, G.N.O
(Hoo, hoo) Let's go, G.N.O
(Hoo, hoo) Let's go, G.N.O, let's go

[Bridge]
Hey, boy
Don't you wish you could've been a good boy?
Try to find another girl like me, boy
Feel me when I tell you
I'm fine and it's time for me to draw the line
I said, hey, boy
Don't you wish you could've been a good boy?
Try to find another girl like me, boy
Feel me when I tell you
I'm fine and it's time for me to draw the line
(Draw the line, draw the line, draw the line)

[Chorus]
'Cause it's a girls night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out
And play out, without you
You better hold tight
This girls night's without you

[Post-Chorus]
(Hoo, hoo) Let's go, G.N.O
(Hoo, hoo) Let's go, G.N.O
(Hoo, hoo) Let's go, G.N.O, let's go
It's a girls night

[Outro]
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo

[Verse 1]
He said, "I got me a nice new apartment
In the city, wouldn't you have hated that?
I'm getting by with a broken heart you left me with"
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back

[Chorus]
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

[Verse 2]
He was lying when he said he moved to L.A
He's just hiding out on the other side of town
With his head in his hands and she's just seven miles away
He's staring out the window and puts her picture down, saying

[Chorus]
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

[Bridge]
She almost called him on the night that he wrote
These simple words on his goodbye note

[Chorus]
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

[Outro]
In dark blue Tennessee

[Verse 1]
She walks to school
With her arms crossed
It's just another day
At 10 o clock she hears this screaming
Then finally she sees them
It's scary how things change
And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and cried

[Chorus]
Didn't she call you
Didn't she need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't she pray too

[Verse 2]
He kissed his wife goodbye
And took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night
To put his kids to sleep
Down the aisle
Three men walked and said
We're here to die for our God
He stood up and said that's funny
Cause my God died for me
I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
I sat down and cried

[Chorus]
And didn't he call you
Didn't he need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't he pray to oh

[Verse 3]
The taxis pulled up
On the very day of
They rode 100 floors up
Just to come back down
They never thought they'd see the day
That the tower's up in flames
There was nothing left to say
When it all came down

[Chorus]
And didn't they call you
Didn't they need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
Where were you
And didn't they pray to
Oh

[Outro]
I walk to school
And I wear a cross
I'm counting
Every day

[Verse 1]
I'll be right here where you need me
Anytime, just keep believin'
And I'll be right here
If you ever need a friend
Someone to care and understand
I'll be right here

[Chorus]
All you have to do is call my name
No matter how close or far away
Ask me once and I'll come, I'll come runnin'
And when I can't be with you, dream me near
Keep me in your heart and I'll appear
All you gotta do is turn around, close your eyes, look inside
I'm right here

[Verse 2]
Isn't it great that you know that
I'm ready to go wherever you're at?
Anywhere, I'll be there

[Chorus]
All you have to do is call my name
No matter how close or far away
Ask me once and I'll come, I'll come runnin'
And when I can't be with you, dream me near
Keep me in your heart and I'll appear
All you gotta do is turn around, close your eyes, look inside
I'm right here

[Bridge]
Whenever you need me
There's no need to worry
You know that I'm gonna be right here

[Chorus]
Ask me once and I'll come, I'll come runnin'
And when I can't be with you, dream me near
Keep me in your heart and I'll appear
All you gotta do is turn around, close your eyes, look inside
I'm right here

[Outro]
Oh, yeah, yeah
I'm right here

[Verse 1]
My momma stood across the room
Face to face but never eye to eye
Recalling words we said
The battle that we swore
We'd never fight
Breaking pieces off with every lie
A tear came to her eye
And she said

[Chorus]
Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you block me out tonight
Honey where are you?
And don't hate me for loving you

[Verse 2]
He walked around my life
And made blind
With every single move
He caught me staring at him
Mad about him
Little that I knew
Love is different
When you play the fool
And all I want to do is say

[Chorus]
Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you make cry tonight
Like you always do
And don't hate me for loving you

[Verse 3]
I slammed the door
Sat on the floor
Cried into my bed
Said are you there?
Do you even care?
To cross above my head
But someone said

[Chorus]
Don't turn away now
And don't rip my heart out
Things are meant to happen like this
I know it's right for you
And don't hate me for loving you

[Outro]
I looked up at the sky
Face to face and finally
Eye to eye

[Verse 1]
Gonna stay in bed today
'Cause I can't stand the light
Don't know why I get so down
I won't be much fun tonight
And I can't believe
You still want to hang around me

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not so pretty all the time
You don't mind
To you, it's alright

[Chorus]
As I am is how you take me
Never try to push or make me different
When I talk, you listen to me
As I am is how you want me and
I know I've found the piece that's missin'
I'm lookin' at him

[Verse 2]
I'm not the girl you think you see
But maybe that's a lie
You almost know me better than
Me, myself, and I
Don't know a lot of things
But I know what I got

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not so perfect every day
I don't have to try
'Cause it all falls into place
(It all falls into place)

[Chorus]
As I am is how you take me
Never try to push or make me different
When I talk, you listen to me
As I am is how you want me and
I know I've found the piece that's missin'
I'm lookin' at him

[Bridge]
Face to face, eye to eye
You're standin' there
Feels good on the inside
I don't mind, I don't care
You're standin' there
Seein' me for the first time
Seein' me for the first time
Seein' me for the first time

[Chorus]
As I am is how you take me
Never try to push or make me different
When I talk, you listen to me
As I am is how you want me and
I know I've found the piece that's missin'
(Found the piece that's missin')
I'm lookin' at him

[Outro]
Found the piece that's missin'
Take me as I am
When I talk, you listen
Take me as I am (Yeah)
Found the piece that's missin'
Take me as I am

[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open

[Verse 1]
The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers
Just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score
Keep your eyes open

[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

[Verse 2]
So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (turn around)
Oh, they've surrounded you
It's a showdown (showdown)
And nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah you've got something they don't
You've just got to keep your eyes open

[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes

[Bridge]
Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
Keep your eyes open
(Keep your eyes open)
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open

[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping

[Outro]
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

[Verse 1]
Wish I had concentrated
They said love was complicated
But it's something I just fell into
And it was overrated
But just look what I've created
I came out alive but I'm black and blue

[Pre-Chorus]
Before you ask me if I’m alright
Think about what I had to do, yeah

[Chorus]
Wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart, put on my makeup
Another mess I didn't plan
And I'll bet you thought you'd beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an "I heart question mark"
Written on the back of my hand

[Verse 2]
I'd be fine if you just walked by
But you had to talk about why
You were wrong and I was right
But I can't believe you made me
Sit at home, cry like a baby
Wait right by the phone every night

[Pre-Chorus]
And now you ask about you and I
There's no you and I
Remember what you put me through, I had to

[Chorus]
Wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart, put on my makeup
Another mess I didn't plan
And I'll bet you thought you'd beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an "I heart question mark"
Written on the back of my hand

[Bridge]
And when you're home all alone at night
You'll still wonder why
You took everything I had, oh, baby
I haven't thought about you and I
There's no you and I
And I know someday you will

[Chorus]
Wake up and smell the breakup
Realize that we won't make up
It didn't go the way you planned
And you'll know you didn't beat me
When you look down and see
I got an "I heart question mark"
Written on the back of my hand

[Outro]
Written on the back of my hand
An "I heart question mark," yeah
Written on the back of my hand

[Verse 1]
I have to wonder
If this wave's too big to ride
Commit or not commit
In such a crazy tide

[Pre-Chorus]
It's sooner than I thought
But you called me out
I lost control and there's no doubt
I'm gonna start all over

[Chorus]
Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And start all over
Here I come, straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And start all over
I'm gonna start all over

[Verse 2]
Fantastic and romantic
All a big surprise (Big surprise)
You got the warning
Hesitation pushed aside

[Pre-Chorus]
It's sooner than I want
But you caught my heart
I guess I'm ready now to start
I'm gonna start all over

[Chorus]
Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And start all over
Here I come, straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And start all over
I'm gonna start all over

[Bridge]
It's so easy, you disrupt me, can't complain
It's so easy, you disrupt me, can't complain
It's so easy, you disrupt me, can't complain
It's so easy (You disrupt me)
I'm gonna start all over (Start all over)

[Chorus]
Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And start all over
Here I come, straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And start all over

[Chorus]
Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And start all over
Here I come, straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And start all over
I'm gonna start all over

[Verse 1]
It's 6 a.m. and I'm wide awake
'Cause I can't stop thinkin'
'Bout the stuff you were sayin' to me
And I, I can't let it slide
The paper's not here yet, the sun's not up
But I'm not afraid
To tell you what I feel inside
I had one of those dreams that makes it all so

[Chorus]
Clear to me now
I got a whole new perspective
It's so clear to me now
You can't treat me that way
It appears to me how
Long you tried to make me think
It was me who was being the fake
So clear

[Verse 2]
Why did I smile when I hurt inside?
Said I was okay, when I knew it's a lie
I wanted to believe in you
You took your chances and one was me
So I'll just forgive you and set you free
Yeah, I'm on my way
Yeah, I'm stepping out of the haze, and it's so

[Chorus]
Clear to me now
I got a whole new perspective (Oh, oh)
It's so clear to me now
You can't treat me that way
It appears to me how
Long you tried to make me think
It was me who was being the fake
So clear

[Bridge]
I wanna put the past behind
Try and maybe I can find better days
The first time in a while
Think I even feel a smile on my face
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
I got a whole new perspective
(Yeah, I do)
(It's so clear)
You can't treat me that way, it's so

[Chorus]
Clear to me now
I got a whole new perspective (So clear)
It's so clear to me now (Now)
You can't treat me that way (So clear)
It appears to me how
Long you tried to make me think
It was me who was being the fake
So clear

[Outro]
Yeah, so clear, so clear, so clear
Sun's going down on a Saturday
And I feel alright, I feel okay

[Verse 1]
Are you overloaded, can't decode it?
Your life's imploding now
There's a risk worth takin', a pain worth achin'
On this hollow ground
(We can) Let go, don't hold onto
All of life's hardest parts
When we think of stoppin', let's keep on rockin'
To the rhythm of our hearts

[Chorus]
We can, we can break out of here
Jump on over there
Where the air is clearer
We can, we can forget the pace
Win in our own race
Become a broken chain, yeah
We are broken chains, yeah
Good and broken

[Verse 2]
Find the magic, go and grab it
Your fate is in your hands
C'mon, find a reason to believe and
Just tell yourself we can

[Chorus]
We can, we can break out of here
Jump on over there
Where the air is clearer
We can, we can forget the pace
Win in our own race
Become a broken chain, yeah
We are broken chains, yeah
Good and broken

[Bridge]
Get off your seat, on your feet
Raise your hands, feel the beat
Let it go, lose control
Feel it in your soul
Don't you know what you can do
If you have faith in you?
Let's not be invisible
There's no red light in life, just go

[Chorus]
We can, we can break out of here
Jump on over there
Where the air is clearer
We can, we can forget the pace
Win in our own race
Become a broken chain, yeah (Become a broken chain)
We are broken chains, yeah (We are broken chains)
Good and broken
(We can, we can) Yeah

[Outro]
We can, we can, we can, we can
We can
We can, we can, we can, we can
We can
We can, we can, we can, we can
We can
Good and broken

[Intro]
Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la

[Verse 1]
You used to call me your angel
Said I was sent straight down from heaven
You'd hold me close in your arms
I loved the way you felt so strong

[Pre-Chorus]
I never wanted you to leave
I wanted you to stay here holdin' me

[Chorus]
I miss you, I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know
I miss you, sha-la-la-la-la, I miss you

[Verse 2]
You used to call me your dreamer
And now I'm livin' out my dream
Oh, how I wish you could see
Everything that's happening for me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinking back on the past
It's true that time is flyin' by too fast

[Chorus]
I miss you, I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know
I miss you, sha-la-la-la-la, I miss you

[Bridge]
I know you're in a better place, yeah
But I wish that I could see your face, oh
I know you're where you need to be
Even though it's not here with me

[Chorus]
I miss you, I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know
I miss you, sha-la-la-la-la

[Chorus]
I miss you, I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know
I miss you, sha-la-la-la-la, I miss you

[Verse 1]
Throwing pennies at the fountain
When you're standing on a mountain
It's kind of hard to aim

Like the tree we carved our names in
There must be an explanation
Guess it didn't get enough rain
I need reasons why you're leaving

[Chorus]
Well I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written on your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star

[Verse 2]
Diving off into the deep end
Honestly believed you'd be there
When I jumped in
Guess it ain't your territory
We had the perfect love story
Except the ending
Nothing comes true
When it comes to you, oh

[Chorus]
Well I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star

[Bridge]
The night was so cloudy
It's not my fault
I just couldn't see

[Chorus]
And I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
Guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star

[Outro]
Throwing pennies at the fountain
When you're standing on a mountain
It's kind of hard to aim

[Verse 1]
I don't think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes
He'll never fall in love, he swears
As he runs his fingers through his hair
I’m laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs

[Chorus]
And I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
I'd lie

[Verse 2]
He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldn't a light go on?
Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long?
He sees everything in black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I don't let nobody see me wishin' he was mine

[Chorus]
I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
I'd lie

[Bridge]
He stands there, then walks away
My God, if I could only say
I'm holding every breath for you
He'd never tell you, but he can play guitar
I think he can see through everything but my heart
First thought when I wake up
Is, "My God, he’s beautiful"
So I put on my makeup
And pray for a miracle

[Chorus]
Yes, I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, oh, and it kills me
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
If you asked me if I love him
I’d lie

[Verse 1]
She didn't have a reason to go, oh no
She didn't have a reason to stay
Either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run

[Pre-Chorus]
And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
But I understand it somehow

[Chorus]
If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why

[Verse 2]
I didn't really know her that well
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind
She felt so out of touch, because  she just felt too much
If you don't know what you want nothing's ever enough

[Pre-Chorus]
And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
That's where I'm headed right now

[Chorus]
If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why

[Verse 3]
I don't have a plan, I don't have a map
I don't even know if I'm ever going back
I don't have a when and I don't have a where
I don't even know if I'll know when I'm there

[Chorus]
But If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by

[Verse 4]
I just drive on by, drive on, drive on
Drive all night
If I drive on, drive on, drive on
Drive all night, just south of knowing why

[Verse 1]
There's a little girl in this little town
With a little too much heart to go around
Live forever, never say never
You could do better, that's what she says

[Chorus]
Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says, "do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Lucky you, lucky you"

[Verse 2]
She sings her little song, she walks along
A little pathway headed for the skies
Left to travels, lives they unravel
Mind over matter, that's what she says

[Chorus]
Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says, "do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Lucky you, lucky you"

[Bridge]
Maybe she'll sing you do-do-do-do
Maybe she'll bring you into the skies
Honey she'll love you, funny how some view
Angels above you aren't so far away

[Chorus]
Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says, "lucky you, lucky you"

[Verse 1]
Your feet under the table
I love it when they're touching mine
Your hands make the crisps at the cradle
To tell me everything is fine
All I see is you looking at me

[Chorus]
Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

[Verse 2]
You smile just like a picture
It doesn't even need a frame
Sometimes I wait to answer
Just to hear you say my name
And all I want is just what I've got

[Chorus]
Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

[Verse 3]
I'd never let you go
Even If I could
Cause I never could've dreamed you up this good

[Chorus]
Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

[Outro]
Made Up You
Oh oh
Made Up You

[Verse 1]
I like glitter and sparkly dresses
But I'm not going to talk about that
In my monologue
I like baking and things that smell like winter
But I'm not going to talk about that
In my monologue

[Chorus]
La la la, la la la

[Verse 2]
I like writing songs about douche bags who cheat on me
But I'm not going to say that
In my monologue
I like writing their names into songs so they're ashamed to go in public
But I'm not going to say that
In my monologue

[Chorus]
La la, la la la la la
This is my musical monologue

[Verse 3]
You might think I'd bring up Joe
The guy who broke up with me on the phone
But I'm not going to mention him
In my monologue
Hey Joe! I'm doing real well
Tonight I'm hosting SNL
But I'm not going to brag about that
In my monologue

[Chorus]
La la la, ha ha ha
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha
La la la

[Verse 4]
And if you're wondering if I might
Be dating the werewolf from Twilight

[mouths "Hi Taylor!", blows him a kiss]
I'm not going to comment on that
In my monologue

[Chorus]
La la, la la la la la
This is my musical monologue

[Verse 5]
You might be expecting me to say
Something bad about Kanye
And how he ran up on the stage
And ruined my VMA monologue
But there's nothing more to say
'Cause everything's okay
I've got security lining this stage
This is my SNL monologue

[Chorus]
La la, la la la la la
This is my SNL monologue
La la, la la la la la
That was my SNL monologue

[Verse 1]
I know we've got a lot to say
Between now and forever
But I'd be a game if you would play
And my dear you get better

All throughout the day
You smile and walk away
All I can think to do
Is follow you

[Chorus]
If you leave I'll be crawling back for more
If you need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you'd be my cure

[Verse 2]
Wherever you think I am tonight
Just know we're miles from a heartbreak
Because in the blink of a pretty brown eye
I'll be right where you are baby
Sometime along the way you take my breath away
Distracted by he view
I fall right into you

[Chorus]
And if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure

[Verse 3]
They say I need to see all the people out there waiting
But you take one look at me
And I know the mistake I'd be making

[Chorus]
Becasue if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you be my cure

[Outro]
I know we've got a lot to say between now and forever

[Verse 1]
Look at you
Look at me
Look at who we could be
I want to know who you are
What you want from the stars
And every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you

[Chorus]
And all I really want to do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind

[Verse 2]
All the time
Everyday
There's nothing I can do, baby, to make it go away
So look at you
And look at me
And think of who we could be
But every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you

[Chorus]
And all I really want to do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind

[Verse 3]
All I really want to say is I need you, babe
But how could you understand?
What happens if you turn away and everything turns blue and grey?
And I just wish I told you never mind
And I could tell you now, but baby, never mind
Yeah, oh yeah
I could tell you now but never mind
Yeah, oh yeah yeah
And I could tell you now but never mind

[Verse 1]
It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
I'm drivin' away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
'Cause I, I still love you but I can't

[Chorus]
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye bye baby
Bye bye baby

[Verse 2]
The picture frame is empty
On the dresser, vacant just like me
I see your writing on the dash
Then back to your hesitation
I was so sure of everything
Everything I thought we'd always have
Guess I never doubted it
Then the here and the now floods in
Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past

[Chorus]
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye bye baby

[Bridge]
And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends

[Chorus]
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me

[Chorus]
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Oh, you took me home, I thought you were gonna keep me
Bye bye baby
Bye bye baby

[Verse 1]
Oh
We were standing in an empty room
The moonlight was falling
You were holding my hand when the car pulled up for you
And I could have spent a life with you
But those days are over
You were calling my name
When your face faded from view

[Pre-Chorus]
Wasn't it you that told me?
The sun would always chase the day
Wasn't it you that told me?

[Chorus]
Angels fly, in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
Stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises that you made? On our last night

[Verse 2]
Oh
I remember waking up with you
The days doing nothing
You meant more to me then, than you ever knew
You were going to be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a Nobel seminar
Hope the the world never tore that out of you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Tell me whatever happened to the things you loved?
And the songs we played and the Indian days
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?
Like Harold and martin singing

I was waving as you drove away
The sunlight was falling
You were riding backwards in a dusty window pane

[Chorus]
Angels fly in the air tonight
Was it just like the promises that we made?
And stars collide in the air so light
Was it just like those promises that you made?
On our last night
On our last night
Oh, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, yeah, oh

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Yeah, uh, feels good, don't it? Listen, uh

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Yeah, this was your city
You did it all and more, broke every law except for one, babe
Attraction, are you ready?
I know you feel it, pull you nearer 'til you feel it again, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I wanna do something right
But we can do something better
Ain’t no time like tonight
And we ain’t trying to save it ’til later
Stay out here living the life
Nobody cares who we are tomorrow
And you got that lil’ something I like
A little something I’ve been wanting to borrow
Tonight the night’s, come on surrender
I won’t lead your love astray, astray, yeah
Your love’s a weapon
Give your body some direction
That’s my aim, then we could

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Take back the night
Come on, use me up until there’s nothing left
Take back the night
Dizzy, spinning, sweating, you can’t catch your breath
Take back the night
Ooh, don’t know when the sun is rising next
Take back the night
So if the feeling’s right, raise your glass and let’s

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Take back the night, take back the night
They gon’ try to shut us down, but I’ll be damned if we gon’ let them
Take back the night, take back the night
You know you gon’ mess around and find out there ain’t no one better
Take back the night, oh
Yeah

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Rare, there’s not too many
No one but you and crowded rooms, we can do anything (yeah)
Attraction can drive you crazy
The way you move, you go crazy, that’s incentive for me

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I wanna do something right
But we can do something better
Ain’t no time like tonight
And we ain’t trying to save it ’til later
Stay out here living the life
Nobody cares who we are tomorrow
And you got that lil’ something I like
A little something I’ve been wanting to borrow
Tonight the night’s, come on surrender
I won’t lead your love astray, astray, yeah
Your love’s a weapon
Give your body some direction
That’s my aim, then we could

[Chorus Justin Timberlake]
Take back the night
Come on, use me up until there’s nothing left
Take back the night
Dizzy, spinning, sweating, you can’t catch your breath
Take back the night
Ooh, don’t know when the sun is rising next
Take back the night
So if the feeling’s right, raise your glass and let’s

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Take back the night, take back the night
They gon’ try to shut us down, I’ll be damned if we gon’ let them
Take back the night, take back the night
You know you gon’ mess around and find out there ain’t no one better

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake, (Middle 8), and Timbaland]
Break it, break it down now
Break it, break it down now
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Yeah, yeah, oh, uh
(And the horns say, alright)
(And the horns say, alright)
(Uh, ooh, and the horns say, alright)
(And the horns say)
(Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)
Take it over
Yeah, yeah
Y’all ready to have a good time out there, ladies and gentlemen?
Ladies and gentlemen, JT and the Tennessee kids
Let your hair down, baby
Take back the night, take back the night

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Take back the night
Ooh, don’t know when the sun is rising next
Take back the night
So if the feeling’s right, then raise your glass and let’s

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Take back the night, take back the night
They gon’ try to shut us down, I’ll be damned if we gon’ let them
Take back the night, take back the night
You know you gon’ mess around and find out there ain’t no one better

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake and (Middle 8)]
(And the horns say) alright
(And the horns say) uh
(And the horns say) feels good to me
(And the horns say) alright, ooh
Take it over

[Ad-lib Outro]

[Hook:]
Thought that I was dreamin'
When you said you loved me
Yes, it started from nothing
Had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
And it started from nothing
Oooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate you now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down, is good
You broke my heart last week
I'll probably feel better
But if we can still remember how you'd hold me
As you're screaming my name
The feeling deep down is good
It's all good, all good, all good
It's all good, all good
It's all good, all good, all good
It's all good, all good

[Verse 1:]
If I could see through walls
I could see you faking
If you could see my thoughts
You would see our faces
Safe in my rental
Like an armor truck
Nah, nah, we ain't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
I'll never be a kid again
We'd try to see if Heaven exists back then, back then
No matter what I did
My waves wouldn't dip back then
Life was chill as fuck back then
We were friends...

[Hook:]

[Intro]
Everybody knows the bones
Just had to find a way
Everybody knows what I am talking about
That is how I'll get an "A"

[Verse 1]
My body's many parts
And this is where it starts
Phalanges, I have ten
And Metatarsals then
I got some tarsal’s too
I will put them in my shoes
The Fibula is next
According to my text
Then comes the tibia
That ain't no phobia
And now I am up to my knee
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's the patella to me

[Chorus]
We're doing the bone dance
You study the answers
Again and again 'til I get it right
We are doing the bone dance
You dance and you will learn it
And we won't not mess up this test
We'll get it perfect

[Verse 2]
And now I take it home with the Partial bone
It might be crazy, but we learn that way
Temporal and Frontal too
And now we are finally through
That makes two hundred and six
I found a way that clicks

[Break]
Bone thugs in the house

[Chorus]
We're doing the bone dance
You study the answers
Again and again 'til I get it right
We are doing the bone dance
You dance and you will learn it
And we won't not mess up this test
We'll get it perfect

[Outro]
Word!

[Verse 1]
I know he loved you a long time ago
I ain't jealous of you, just thought you should know
You were never good enough for him or anything like me
So you might as well sit back 'cause I ain't trying to show maturity

[Chorus]
"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker, oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart in permanent marker?

[Verse 2]
I found that picture of you in that green dress
He sure had a good time cleaning up that mess
He found thirty other pieces but he'll never find them all
Tried to tape it back together, now he knows to keep it off the wall

[Chorus]
"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker, oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart in permanent marker?
"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker, oh, yeah
Oh, just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart?
"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker, oh, yeah
Just like the mark that you knew that you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart in permanent marker?

[Outro]
In permanent marker
Oh, permanent marker, yeah

[Verse 1]
I remember you bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

[Chorus]
"Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years"

[Verse 2]
I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, "Why?"
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted, if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear

[Chorus]
"Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital grey
We'll just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years"

[Bridge]
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

[Outro]
I remember you bare feet, down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back

[Chorus: Devin The Dude & Dee Goodz]
What you gonna do when the people go home
And you wanna smoke weed but the reefer's all gone
And somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out the doobie ashtray?
Why they'd do me that way?
What you gonna do when ya friends go home
And you wanna drink a beer but ya ends all gone?
Somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out my doobie ashtray (Uh)
Why they'd do me that way? (Uh)

[Verse 1: Dee Goodz]
I'm makin' the final decisions that could somehow make a nigga vision come true
Then I'ma give the game a one-two
For now I tell the homies, "Come through"
Politickin' while we chillin', plannin' how to make a million
Got the features of a ceilin', I'm high
Can't seem to figure out the formula
But when I do, I'm warnin' ya
Success I swear I'm on to ya
Joining fake friends on a journey to make Henz his attorney
I can't when these niggas clowns like Bert and Ernie
My attorney handles all the bull
Niggas try to stop me in the game, I'm on my Manning shit
Now watch me call the audible
You can gather all the pool and all the fucking tour and niggas still wouldn't be the shit to me
I'm reachin' out for a position Big ain't get to see
Give these hatin' niggas the trigger, kill 'em with creative vigor
As I make my homies leave, devote my time to payin' it back
I look around the crib and all a sudden then I'm mad because

[Chorus: Devin The Dude & Mac Miller]
What you gonna do when the people go home
And you wanna smoke weed but the reefer's all gone
And somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out the doobie ashtray?
Why they'd do me that way?
What you gonna do when ya friends go home (I like this)
And you wanna drink a beer but ya ends all gone? (Dee Goodz)
Somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out my doobie ashtray (What's good? Haha, my man)
Why they do me that way? (Look, yeah, uh)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
So put ya shit out in the doobie ashtray
While the ganja burnin' slow and we movin' that way
Yeah, my crew got mad haze, enough that we can share with you
I'm brand new, you could use a repair or two
Weed smoke impair my view, the color of it very blue
Who could smoke up with the Most Dope homie? Very few
Huffin' and puffin', the bud in the oven you coughin' and we love it and breakin' it down
Who be the man with a doobie in hand, calling the kid to bring it around?
Life is hard, so we smoke away the stress
Without my Mary Jane I'ma mess
So I gotta keep it fresh, grab a zip and nothin' less
You can come smoke too 'cause I love a bunch of guests, yes
Marijuana dreams, Californiacation
Take a couple hits before I have to board this plane. and
Stop complainin', just give me my weed back
Find me where the trees at, I'm just tryna relax

[Chorus: Devin The Dude]
What you gonna do when the people go home
And you wanna smoke weed but the reefer's all gone
And somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out the doobie ashtray?
Why they'd do me that way?
What you gonna do when ya friends go home
And you wanna drink a beer but ya ends all gone?
Somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out my doobie ashtray
Why they'd do me that way?

[Outro: Devin The Dude]
Don't front (All gone)
Don't front
All gone
Don't front
Don't front (All gone)
Don't front
All gone
Don't front
Don't front (All gone)

[Verse 1]
Let's watch the tide chase the waves onto the sand
I wonder if a broken heart can feel the warmth of my hand
And I wonder what a piece of driftwood has seen all through his lifetime
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights

[Chorus 1]
I've seen a million things
Spoke a million words
Now I only want to speak to you
Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing I'd rather do
On the smokey black nights

[Verse 2]
Still through the haze I can make out constellations
I'll make one of you and me as we sit in the sand
And I saw that sunset gleaming as my eyes went wild
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights

[Chorus 2]
I've played a thousand songs
Sang a thousand words
Now I only want to sing to you
Waited on a wire
Staring at the fire
There's nothing I'd rather do
On the smokey black nights

[Chorus 3]
I've walked a thousand miles
Smiled a thousand smiles
Now I only smile when I'm with you
Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing I'd rather do
On the smokey black nights

[Outro]
So walk with me as the sweet wind dances
I'll write a song for you and me on the smokey black nights

[Verse 1]
Days go by, I wonder if you hear me
Can't you read between the lines?
Now I'm standing still, I am disappearing
Take this chance, I'll make you mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

[Chorus]
But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

[Verse 2]
He tells lies, are you really thinking
That you deserve another try
When you see these eyes
You see another planet
Don't ask how, but fate decides

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

[Chorus]
But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

[Verse 3]
Spinning and turning
And living and learning
I should be able to handle this
Make it or break it
Move it or shake it
Do it or fake it
Girl you've got to make it

[Chorus]
But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

[Outro]
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning me around
And all I see is you

[Verse 1]
Let me know, how's it feel
To be under my skin, wrapped around my heart
Is it like anywhere you've been?
And everything I do, I do it just for you

[Chorus]
So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Why you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

[Verse 2]
I have been looking in, trying to read your mind
Give you the benefit of the doubt, every single time
And then you walk right by, I'm screaming out inside

[Chorus]
Why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Why you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

[Bridge]
What happens when you wake up, to see that you've lost?
You take one look at me, cause that's what it cost
I just wanna be everything you need
Cause you're everything to me

[Chorus]
So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Why you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

[Outro]
Let me know, how's it feel to be under my skin

[Verse 1]
Tire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze
Wilson County creek
Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass
Baby, you were watching me
Cold barns, truck beds, everything you said
Slowly educating me
I never had a lesson so sweet

[Chorus]
You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you

[Verse 2]
Autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change
Just like the two of us
Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
Guess I loved you way too much
But I'm a little smarter, my heart's a little harder
But it's still soft enough to cry
Cause I remember those times
I remember

[Chorus]
You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you

[Bridge]
Saw you just the other day
All that I could think to say was
"Hey, how have you been?"
You caught me with that old smile
Said, "It's really been a while
And I still think about back when"

[Chorus]
We used to get high on the first kiss
We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus
And you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and now I'm someone new
And that's what I learned from you

[Outro]
Oh, that's what I learned from you
That's what I learned from you, oh you, oh
That's what I learned from you, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
You were what I wanted
When I wanted what I just couldn't have
You were country lovin'
Really somethin' for three months and a half
Everybody said that you were bad news
But, baby, I was betting on you

[Chorus]
So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
I guess I'm gonna have to listen to my mama's "I told you so"
But you ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

[Verse 2]
I said, "Let them say we're crazy"
You said, "Let's go fishing tonight"
The midnight moon was blazing, baby
I was looking into your eyes
Everything changed when you took me to town
Caught you staring every other girl down

[Chorus]
So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
I guess I'm gonna have to listen to my mama's "I told you so"
But you ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

[Bridge]
Can't believe the time you lost me
Can't believe what it cost me

[Chorus]
I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
Had to go and listen to my mama's "I told you so"
You ain't never been through that
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

[Verse 1]
I’m a laid back
T-shirt, blue jean, mood ring, kinda girl
Hey, yeah, what’s the word on you?
Lay low
I’m a mission rebel, angel devil
Little left of the middle
Sometimes I get temperamental

[Chorus]
But here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it’s all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh, what you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key
To the diary of me

[Verse 2]
I’m poetry
Complicated, simply stated
Hey yeah, baby, how about you?
I was born free
I’m a cell phone hippie
Are you with me?
When I mess up, I don’t get up
I just get down, yeah

[Chorus]
But here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it’s all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh, what you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key
To the diary of me

[Verse 3]
It’s raining on Sunday
There’s nothin' on TV
Yesterday was lonely
You’re the only one who gets me
My mind is like an island
Drifting through the ocean
I can’t stop thinkin' about you
I bet you’re thinkin' of me too

[Chorus]
Well, here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it’s all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh, what you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key
To the diary of me
Yeah, here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it’s all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh, what you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key
To the diary of me

[Verse 1]
Should have been different but
It wasn't different, was it
Same old story, dear john
And so long
Should have fit like a glove
Should have fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring
A token of true love
Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't

[Chorus]
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
You keep seeing double
With the wrong one
You can't see I love you
You can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble

[Verse 2]
So now you're thinking 'bout
All you're missing how
Deep you're sinking
Round and round and dragging down
Why don't you cash in your chips
Why don't you call it a loss
Not such a big loss
Chalk it up better luck
Could have been true love
But it wasn't
It should all add up
But it doesn't

[Chorus]
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
You keep seeing double
With the wrong one
You can't see I love you
You can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble

[Bridge]
Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't

[Chorus]
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
You keep seeing double
With the wrong one
You can't see I love you
You can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble

[Verse 1]
Beneath the chandelier of stars and atmosphere
Tangled like the roots on the ground
The windows opened up
The wind is blowing and we're both not making a sound
It’s like I’m melting on into you
Give me a reason why we should ever move
And

[Chorus]
Tell me
You’ll never leave me
And I’m not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

[Verse 2]
Could this be better?
You write me letters
Though you see me every day
You tend to treat me like
My name is up in lights
It really blows me away
Lock me up in a dark room
And I still can’t take my eyes off you

[Chorus]
Tell me
You’ll never leave me
And I’m not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

[Bridge]
All those kisses up against your car
For all those wishes on planes
We thought were stars
Memories like photographs
Oh, baby, here we are

[Chorus]
Tell me
You’ll never leave me
And I’m not crazy and
Oh, this is really happening
Oh, oh, baby

[Chorus]
Tell me
You’ll always need me
That I drive you crazy
And this is really happening
Oh, that this is really happening

[Outro]
Tell me, oh
You’ll always need me
(need me, tell me)
(Baby)
That I drive you crazy
(Oh)
That this is really happening

[Verse 1]
Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

[Pre-Chorus]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around

[Chorus]
Well, can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

[Verse 2]
Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make, everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

[Pre-Chorus]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around, yeah

[Chorus]
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

[Bridge]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down

[Breakdown]
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way

[Chorus]
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

[Outro]
Today was a fairytale

[Verse 1]
We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night and we were happy
I do recall a good while back, we snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it
And we were happy

[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

[Verse 2]
We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy

[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy
We were happy

[Bridge]
Oh, I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices and that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy
We were happy

[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
And we were happy
We were happy
Oh-oh-oh-oh
We were happy

[Verse 1]
What do you say, when you just know
That he's the one, and you want to go fast
But he's taking it slow
And what do you do, when he's next to you
But he's a little bit shy
Well here's something you can try

[Chorus]
Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's going to go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say?

[Verse 2]
What do you see, when you look in his eyes
There's something there
That he can't disguise
No matter how he tries
And what do you feel, when you know it's real
And you can't sit still
If you don't own up will yeah

[Chorus]
Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's going to go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say?

[Bridge]
My imagination's running away
Just dreaming about
What I want you to say

[Chorus]
Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's going to go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday

What do you say?
What do you say?

[Outro]
What do you say?
What do you say?

[Verse 1]
She's looking in the mirror
The moment's getting nearer
She thinks about it as she walks her walk
Up and down the staircase
Make up fresh on her face
She thinks about it as she talks her talk

[Verse 2]
School dance, first chance
Always been a dreamer
There's one guy, she's shy
Sees him through the mirror
And everybody looks at her
She thinks about it
Blue dress, angel face
Looking in the mirror
Shoes, purse, hair tied back
And you should see her
She's got her magic
Floating through the air

[Chorus]
Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you got to love her
She's got her hopes up
Got them up to there
Wondering what to wear

[Verse 4]
She's standing in her bedroom
He'll be pulling up soon
She thinks about it when she sees headlights
Looking out the window
She's got her diary to show
That she's been waiting for this all her life
First date, can't wait
Looking in the mirror
Heart all wrapped up
Wait until he sees her
He's looking right at her
She thinks about it
Sixteen blue jeans, Abercrombie T-shirt
Shoes, purse, hair tied back
And you should see her
She's got her magic
Floating through the air

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The years went by
The mirror saw her cry
She got up again
She got up again
The wind blew by
The small town lights
She got up again
Move out, find out
Where the world can take her
Bright lights, late nights
Living for the greater
Move to Paris
Living on a prayer

[Chorus]
Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you got to love her
She's got her hopes up
Got them up to there
She's got her hopes up
Got them up to there
Wondering what to wear

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Wondering what to wear

[Verse 1]
I can't believe you did it again
Walked by and took my heart with you
Why did you have to look so good?
Don't you know that I'm trying to hate you
Trying to have a dream without you in it
But how can I put out this fire
When you're the one who lit it

[Chorus]
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really OK when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be
Over you for real
Until I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

[Verse 2]
I've got a stack of papers so high
And it's all about you baby
Keep thinking maybe I
Can make sense of something crazy
Something I can't get out of my Head
I write your name I write your name
Then I tear it all to shreds

[Chorus]
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really OK when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be
Over you for real
Until I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

[Verse 3]
And if you ever change your mind
And want me back again
I hope these songs will remind me
Why I shouldn't let you in

[Chorus]
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really OK cause I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be
Over you for real
Until I do

[Chorus]
I'll just wait for the day
I stop pretending
That I'm really OK when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be over you for real
Till I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

[Verse 1]
Carry me up them stairs
Put my white socks on
And my pretty song
You like my blue nail polish?
"What is all this?", you said
"The mess upstairs
Don't be scared"

[Verse 2]
Daddy dearest, you know
How I like to take trips
Pops, first stop at the K-Mart
Buy me my peach lip gloss
Cigarettes and lollipops
Mad magazines, and white socks
All in your car for
Our trip across the U.S.A

[Chorus]
We going to party
Like it's 1949
We in the Pontiac
From July to July
It's a flower motel nation
Day and night on our last vacation
We going to see it all
Before we say goodbye

[Verse 3]
Daddy likes Blackpool
Pleasure Beach and road stops
Baby likes some Swiss Alps
Souvenir gift shops
Late night, midnight
Radio show talks
Daddy, baby
Big jail break

[Verse 4]
Ponytail and lollipops
Dinerettes and soda pops
New blue bathing suit
Ruched tops and Cadillacs
Blue lake car to Dunks
Hopscotch, shit talk
Alabama hard knocks
Motel brass locks

[Chorus]
We going to party
Like it's 1949
We in the Pontiac
From July to July
It's a motel flower nation
Day and night on our last vacation
We going to see it all
Before we say goodbye

[Verse 1]
I bet you lie awake at night
Trying to make up your sweet mind
Wondering if you'll ever find
Just what you want
A home-town number one
Or a California loaded gun
But you know you only get one
Or that's what you thought
But here's what you've got

[Chorus]
I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need
I'd give everything to be your anything

[Verse 2]
If you want hard to get
If you want
All you have to do is let me know
If you want a bumpy ride
Or someone with a softer side
Either one will be alright
Just let me know
Cause this is where it goes

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
It's not like I'm giving up who I am for you
But for someone like you it's just so easy to do

[Chorus]
I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need
If that's what you need

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I heard a song tonight on the radio
Another girl sings about a boy
Just sees his face in every space in every room
And I know that if I turn around you won't be there
If I close my eyes will you be there?

[Chorus]
I don't want to lose your face
And I don't want to wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't want to turn around
Because I’m not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I don't want to lose your face

[Verse 2]
I've got a picture of you in my bedroom
And I hope it never falls
And I hope I never lose that feeling
I used to get when you would call
And now I wonder to myself
Who were you and where are you?
Were you ever here at all?

[Chorus]
I don't want to lose your face
And I don't want to wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't want to turn around
Because I’m not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I don't want to lose your face

[Verse 3]
That girl in the song had it so good
I wish I could close my eyes and see you
I wish the sky had your face
And the oceans had your eyes
And the sunset had your lips
And I had you

[Chorus]
I don't want to lose your face
And I don't want to wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't want to turn around
Because I’m not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I don't want to lose your face

[Verse 1]
What ever never knew that I could feel so good
Smile in your eyes
What ever never knew that I could walk through wood
I guess I never tried
A million years old, but just a little girl
Vibing off the gong
Rubbing on the bowls, make you float around
Make your loving strong

[Pre-Chorus]
And when we get in the same place
At the same time, it is your grace
That I want to fall right into now
To love avow

[Chorus]
I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into gurumukh
I said I'm falling into grace with you, oh yeah
I'm falling into gurumukh

[Verse 2]
She moves in a rapture that her capsule might
Land on your star
Meditating in the morning, head dressed in white
Beauty bazaar
You can smell the purple light coming from her heart
Get lost and wet
I treat you like a teacher 'cause that's what you are
I wanna be your pet

[Pre-Chorus]
And when we get in the same place
At the same time, it is your grace
That I want to fall right into now
To love avow

[Chorus]
I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into gurumukh
I said I'm falling into grace with you, oh yeah
I'm falling into gurumukh

[Instrumental Bridge with Vocalizations]

[Chorus]
I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into gurumukh
I said I'm falling into grace with you, oh yeah
I'm falling into gurumukh
I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into gurumukh
Oh, Lord, I'm falling into grace with you, with you
I'm falling into gurumukh

[Verse 1]
Well, I see you standing there like a rabid dog
And you got those crying eyes
Makes me wanna surrender and wrap you in my arms
You know I try to live without regrets
I'm always moving forward and not looking back
But I tend to leave a trail of dead while I'm moving ahead

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And so I'm steppin' away
'Cause I got nothin' to say

[Chorus 1]
Feels like, feels like it's comin'
It feels like, feels like a coming of age (It's like a coming of age)
Feels like, feels like it's comin'
Feels like, feels like a coming of age

[Verse 2]
And when my fear pulls me out to sea
And the stars are hidden by my pride and my enemies
I seem to hurt the people that care the most
Just like an animal, I protect my pride
When I'm too bruised to fight
And even when I'm wrong, I tend to think I'm right

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well, I'm bored of the game
And too tired to rage

[Chorus 2]
Feels like, feels like it's comin'
It feels like, feels like a coming of age (It's like a coming of age)
It feels like, feels like it's comin'
It feels like, feels like a coming of age (And I'm burning the page)

[Chorus 1]
Feels like, feels like it's comin'
It feels like, feels like a coming of age (It's like a coming of age)
It feels like, feels like it's comin'
It feels like, feels like a coming of age

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 3]
It feels like, feels like a coming of age (Yeah, it's like a coming of age)
Feels like, feels like it's comin'
It feels like, feels like a coming of age (Like a coming of age)
Feels like, feels like it's comin'
It feels like, feels like a coming of age (It's like a coming of age)
Feels like, feels like it's comin'
It feels like, feels like a coming of age

[Verse]
I was just a backpack rapper, backpack of Krylon
Fat caps, slab of concrete that I would write on
Eighth grade when "Triumph" came out, and I'm like, "Hey mom
Can I skip school? I can't even wait!" "Nah!"
Thirteen years later, praise God
I just got DM by Raekwon
And he wants me up on the same song
And Method Man's pissed off for doing the crowd walk
But it wasn't nothing, man, we squashed it, nah
I'm from the city Nirvana where that mosh pit started

[?] from where Kool Herc started
That doesn't mean that I won't kill the beat and be a martyr
Aspestos with pencils my pens choke as coffins
West Coast, success toast, Seattle down to Compton
What does it say about America that I became a millionaire
Between kicks and snares and couldn't get in to college
Aight, switch topics
I don't walk I get piggybacks on Action Bronson
Show up at Em's crib with the split of vodka
Hit up Mac Miller, relapse and celebrate kwanzaa
On behalf of us white rappers
I think it's a fact that yes we have appropriated culture
It's just race, let's talk not make it awkward
I wrote a song about thrift shop's
I never thought it would ever get a spin, radio did its thing
And all of sudden the song popped up and got popular
Would that have happen if I wouldn't be a cracker?
Sold 6 millie, does skin tone really matter?
We live in America, land of gimmicks and ladders
And did I go climb it, bastard, of course race was a factor
But bitch I'm a B-boy and I put that beat in the casket
Listen to The Heist, man, we almost made a classic
You gon' agree, that's vantastic
Take away Thrift Shop and can't hold us going platinum
9 times, alright fine
But I made it uncool for kids to say "faggot"
I got rich and I didn't go buy a mansion
Gave away 200K to the homies that didn't have it
And when I fall off and the second album flops
And turn into Vanilla Ice, wait, that's never gonna happen

[Verse 1]
I like to stick to walls
Observing conversations, lifting them when they fall
I am a fire escape,
My spine is made of iron, my heart pumps out old red paint

[Bridge - Chorus]
Save yourself, save yourself, yourself
Save yourself, save yourself

[Verse 2]
I see the seasons change
All the young faces come and replace the dying ones
Sit out on Lexington and Vine
All the pimps and prostitutes wave you down at stopping signs

[Chorus]
Save yourself, save yourself, yourself
Save yourself, save yourself

[Verse 3]
Los Angeles, I've been waiting for you
To pick yourself up and change
The city you've made on this ocean of sand
Was founded on liars and self-made men

[Outro]
I've watched the dreamers find their legs
And I've seen the ones that come get reduced to bones and rags

'Cause I am a fire escape
My spine is made of iron, my heart pumps out old red paint

Save yourself, save yourself
(Save yourself) Save yourself, save yourself

[Intro]
You ever want something
That you know you shouldn't have
The more you know you shouldn't have it
The more you want it
And then one day you get it
It's so good to you
But it's just like my girl
When she's around me
I just feel so good, so good
But right now I just feel cold, so cold
Right down to my bones
'Cause, ooh

[Verse 1]
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away, hey

[Verse 2]
Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
(Anytime she goes away) Mmm

[Bridge]
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, know
I know, know, know, know, know
Oh, I know, I know
Hey, I ought to leave (Ought to leave)
I ought to leave her alone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)

[Verse 3]
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
Only darkness every day
(Only darkness every day)
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just is no home
Anytime she goes away
(Anytime she goes away)

[Bridge]
(Ain't no sun) Oh

Ain't no sun
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
When she's gone
(It's not warm when she's away)
It's not warm when she's away
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

[Outro]
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)

Anytime she goes away
(Only darkness every day)
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
Whenever that little girl goes away
Na na na na na

(Only darkness every day)
Anytime she goes away

[Verse 1]
Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time, let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry, 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've learned the meaning to your story
And it's enough love for me to stay

Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
Well, it's not my thing trying to get back
But this time, let me tell you where I'm at

[Chorus]
I wanna, wanna be where you are, oh oh
Anywhere you are, oh oh
I wanna, wanna be where you are, oh oh
Everywhere you are, oh

[Verse 2]
Please don't close the door to our future
There's so many things we haven't tried
I will love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside

[Chorus]
I wanna, wanna be where you are, oh oh
Any, any, anywhere you are, oh oh
I wanna, wanna be where you are, oh oh
I gotta, gotta be where you are, oh oh

Foolish of me, I couldn't see
The forest for the trees
You've been so true
I've been so cruel to you
Oh, girl, please don't leave me

[Chorus]
If you stay, I'll find a way
To erase the past
Baby, don't leave me
Girl, don't take your love from me
Oh, girl

[Verse 2]
What can I say to make you stay?
Baby, don't leave me
You've been so kind
It blows my mind to know
Oh, girl, I really hurt you

[Chorus]
Tell me, girl, it's not too late
And you'll give me a chance
To make it up to you
Don't take your love from me
Girl, don't take your love

Don't take your
Don't take your love)

[Bridge]
Girl, if you take your love away from me (No, no, no)
I'm going to be in misery (No, no, no)
Your love is the strength that I lean upon (Don't take your love from me)
How will I make it when it's gone?
Of all the little things I wanted to say (No, no, no)
Or really wanted to do (No, no, no)
Girl, this time (No, no, no)
Ooh
Oh, girl, I really mean it

[Chorus]
So tell me girl, it's not too late
And you'll give me a chance
To make it up to you
Don't take your love from me
Girl, don't take your love

(No, no, no)

[Intro]
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today
In our small way

[Verse 1]
Empty words are not enough
Where there's hurt, we'll be a crutch
When there's thirst, we'll fill each other's cup
Because we care, we love
Enough to share (Enough to share)

[Chorus]
Maybe you and I can't do great things (Do great things)
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today (Today)
In our small way

[Verse 2]
In despair, we'll be the hope (Be the hope)
And the prayer that frees the soul (Frees the soul)
We'll be there to share each lonely road (Lonely road)
Because we love, I know (I know)
We care enough, yeah (We care enough)

[Chorus]
Maybe you and I can't do great things (Do great things)
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today (Today)
In our small way

[Bridge]
Just a little time is all it takes (Just a little time is all it takes)
What a difference just a smile can make, you'll see (We've got)
Love is all we need (We've got love, yeah)

[Chorus]
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
(But we still) But we still can change some things today
In our small way

Ag shame if Yo-landi Vi$$er's fucking with your brain
Don't think about it too much, you'll pop a fokken vein

You're chilling in the fast lane fucking up my zoom
Lekker fokken brain strain, keeping up with this shit
All up in the main vain, keep it fuckin' twisted

People think they know me, but they don't know shit
Follow my every move, sniff the seat after I sit
Make you feel it when I spit, want ek spoeg jou fokken nat
All I know is that I'm blowing up like jissus, what the fuck?

Ja, I'm a rebel! Fuck you if you're not on my level

Lot of nosy naaiers digging in my past
Like an irritating little finger in my arse
Ja sure, Ninja changed a little since he left school
So did you but the thing is you a little less cool

Look at me now man, damn! I don't know where I am
What must I do with all this fucking money in my hand?
Used to be a no one, now I'm the fucking man
With this fuck-you money to say fuck you cause I can

Woah, jissis guys, this is nice
Chilling up in motherfucking business class
Take this hot face cloth, wipe my bum
Get it lekker fucking ready so that you can kiss my ass

Got to be there in the morning
When she says hello to the world
Got to be there (Got to be there)

I need her sharing her world beside me

When this old world gets you down
When your spirit's on the ground
Just remember I will always be around
Just climb on the wings of my love
I'll take you high on the wings of my love

[Verse 2]
When you're feeling all alone
Like a child who's got no home
You know you've always got a place where you can go
Just climb on the wings of my love

Like a beach that knows no boundaries with all the trees
As it rushes to the seas, darling, we'll be just as free
I'll lift your spirits high, our love will fly
We'll have heaven, blue skies, and forever sunshine

[Verse 3]
'Till you break those ties that bind
'Till that day you're really mine
Anytime you want to leave your world behind

[Chorus]
Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now you're gone

[Verse 1]
You persuaded me to love you, and I did
But instead of tenderness, I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell, so unaware
Of the loneliness that was waiting there

[Pre-Chorus]
You closed the door to your heart, girl
And you turned the key
Locked your love away from me

[Chorus]
Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
And, oh, my darling, now you're gone

[Verse 2]
You said loving you would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came into my heart
You turned and you walked, just walked away

[Pre-Chorus]
You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then you took my hope
Look at me now

[Verse 3]
Look at me
See what lovin' you has done to me
Look at my face
See how crying has left its trace
After you made me all your own
Then you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart cries out for your touch
But baby, you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air

[Chorus]
Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now you're gone

You made me love you (Love, love is here)
Oh oh, my darling, now you're gone (And now you're gone)
Talking 'bout love, love, love, love, ooh, ooh (Love, love is here)
My darling, now you're gone (And now you're gone)

Talking 'bout love, love, love, love, ooh, ooh (Love, love is here)
My darling, now you're gone (And now you're gone)
Talking 'bout love, love, love, love, ooh, ooh (Love, love is here)
My baby, now you're gone (And now you're gone)

[Intro]
Mhm, aah ha, yeah yeah
Alright
Love hurt, love hurt
Yeah yeah
Aah ha

[Verse 1]
(Ooh) Hey my girl
She does something to my chemistry
And when I'm close I'm sure
I raise her temperature
'bout three degrees

Everyday, yeah
In every way she
Makes my motor purr
And I reciprocate
My life I dedicate to lovin' her

[Chorus]
So we've got a good thing going
A real good thing going yeah
That girl and me
And I don't have to ask
Cause I know it's
Gonna last eternally
(Now let me tell you what we got)

[Verse 2]
Understanding
Whenever handing any alibis
Instead of what you do
Where you been or what's the use
We're making nice

[Chorus Outro]
You see we've got a good thing going
A real good thing going yeah
That girl and me
And she don't have to ask
Cause she know it's
Gonna last eternally
I guess love just wasn't enough for us to survive
I swear, I swear, I swear I tried
You took the life right out of me
I'm so unlucky I can't breathe
You took the life right out of me, me, me, me
I'm longing for your heartbeat
Heartbeat, heartbeat

[Verse 1]
When you're down and troubled
And you need some lovin' care
And nothing, no, nothing is goin' right
Just close your eyes and think of me
And soon I'll be there to brighten up
Yeah, even your darkest night

[Pre-Chorus]
You just call out my name
And you know, wherever I am
I'll come a-running, yeah yeah
To see you again

[Chorus]
Winter, spring, summer, or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yes I will
You've got a friend, oh yeah
You've got a friend
You've got a friend, oh baby
You've got a friend

[Verse 2]
When the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind, yeah
He begins to blow
Here's what you do baby
You keep your head together, together baby
And call my name out loud
And you'll hear me knocking, knocking at your door
Oh yes I will, yes I will

[Pre-Chorus]
You just call out my name
And you know, wherever I am
I'll come a-running, yeah, yeah
To see you again
Ooh

[Chorus]
Winter, spring, summer, or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yes I will

[Bridge]
Ain't it good to know
That you got a friend
People can be so cold
They'll hurt you, yeah, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them
But don't let them, no no no, don't let them
Hmm

[Chorus]
Winter, spring, summer, or fall
All you have to do is call and I'll be there
I'll be there, yes I will

[Outro]
Oh
You've got a friend, yes you do
You've got a friend, yes you do
Right til' the end, right for you
Ain't it good to know
You've got a friend, yes you do
You've got a friend, yes you do
Right till the end, right for you
Ain't it good to know
You've got a friend, yes you do
You've got a friend, yes you do
Right till the end, right for you
Ain't it good to know
You've got a friend, yes you do
You've got a friend, yes you do
Right till the end, right for you

[Verse 1]
Ben, the two of us need look no more
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I'll never be alone
And you my friend will see
You've got a friend in me
(You've got a friend in me)

[Verse 2]
Ben, you're always running here and there
(Here and there)
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
(Anywhere)
If you ever look behind
And don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go
(You've got a place to go)

[Bridge]
I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it's "us", now it's "we"
(I used to say "I" and "me")
(Now it's "us", now it's "we")

[Verse 3]
Ben, most people would turn you away (Turn you away)
I don't listen to a word they say (A word they say)
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I'm sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben

[Outro]
(A friend)
Like Ben

Like Ben

[Verse 1]
Love is like a circus
And a carnival is beautiful to see
Love can turn your mind around
Like Ferris wheels and spinning carousels

You'll be a part of the world of make believe
Flying high like a man on a trapeze

[Chorus]
Oh, everyday's a holiday
Get your tickets right away

When it's cold outside I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

I've got so much honey the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Ooh

I don't need no money, fortune, or fame
I've got all the riches baby one man can claim
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
With my girl

I've even got the month of May
With my girl
Everybody is somebody's fool
The world is the biggest school
As you live, you learn, though a torch will burn
Everybody's somebody's fool (Everybody's somebody's fool)

You go through life making fools of others
Pretending you're giving them love
But remember, sister or brother
You all have to answer to the one up above (To the one up above)

It's beautiful to watch love begin
But, oh, so sad when it ends (So sad when it ends)
As you go through life, remember this rule
Everybody's somebody's fool (Everybody's somebody's fool)

Oh, it's beautiful to watch love begin
But, oh, so sad when it ends (So sad when it ends)
As you got through life, remember this rule
Everybody's somebody's fool (Everybody's somebody's fool)

[Verse 1]
Your precious sweetheart, she is so faithful
She is so true, oh yeah
Her dreams are tumbling
Her world is crumbling
Because of you, uh uh
One day you will hurt her just once too much
And when you finally lose your tender touch

[Chorus]
Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-DA-day
Her feet may wander, her heart may stray
Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-DA-day
You are going to send your baby straight to me

[Verse 2]
I am going to give her all the loving
Within my heart, oh yeah
I am going to patch up every single little dream
You have torn apart, understand me now?
And when she tells you she is crying her last tear
Heaven knows I am going to be somewhere near

[Chorus]
Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-DA-day
Her feet may wander, her heart may stray
Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-DA-day
That's gonna send your baby straight to me

Oh yeah-yeah, you better
You better listen to me, yeah

[Verse 3]
Heartaches are calling and tears are falling
Because of you, oh yeah
And when you are gone she will know
I am the one to go to her rescue
Maybe you did not know that man
You are going to leave her one too many times
And when you come back that
Girl is going to be mine, all mine

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
Just because you know I love you so much
Don't be afraid to tell me you are sad
Because you lost his love
Though your love is not for me
I don't wanna to see you in misery
So come on, baby come on

[Chorus]
You can cry on my shoulder
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me
All your troubles to me

[Verse 2]
Big girls ain't supposed to cry
If you do I will understand
Maybe I can show you how you can win his love again
It may seem strange I know
But it is just that I love you
So come on, baby come on

[Chorus]
You can cry on my shoulder
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me
(Bring them to me, girl)

He better stop treating you so bad
Come on baby (Come on, come on)
Come on, oh yeah

And bring all your troubles to me
(Bring them to me, girl)

I will be there to help

[Outro]
You can cry, you can cry, you can cry
Baby

[Chorus]
With a child's Heart
Go face the worries of the day
With a child's heart
Turn each problem into play

[Verse 1]
No need to worry, no need to fear
Just being alive makes it all so very clear

[Chorus]
With a child's heart
Nothing can ever get you down
With a child's heart
You've got no reason to frown

[Verse 2]
Love is as welcome
As a sunny, sunny day
No grown-up thoughts
To lead our hearts astray
Take life easy, so easy, nice and easy
Like a child, so gay and so carefree
Yeah
The whole world smiles with you
As you go your merry way

[Chorus Outro]
Oh with a child's heart
Nothing's gonna get me, nothing's gonna get
Nothing's gonna get me down
Oh with a child's heart
Nothing's gonna get me, nothing's gonna get
Nothing's gonna get me down
Oh with a child's heart
Sing nothing's gonna get me, nothing's gonna get
Nothing's gonna get me down

[Verse 1]
Into each life some rain falls
Then comes the snow
But after the snow
The flowers will grow
Girl when my life got stormy
You stayed for the ride
You stayed by my side
You make the sun shine

[Chorus]
I am up again I never let you down
Nothing's ever going to stop me now
Up again I never let you down
I love you

[Verse 2]
This Humpty Dumpty is lucky
He had his fall
But after it all
He brushed himself off
Knowing how much you loved me
I made one more try
I reached for the sky
And I made it this time

[Chorus Outro]
I am up again I never let you down
Nothing's ever going to stop me now
Up again I never let you down
I love you

[Verse 1]
You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song
You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are

[Chorus]
Some day my happy arms will hold you
And someday I will know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine

[Verse 2]
You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are

[Chorus Outro]
Some, some, some, some, day
My happy arms will hold you
And someday I will know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine
Yeah yeah, all the things you are, are mine
All the things you are, got to be mine
Some day you are, are mine
All the things you are, got to be mine
All the things you are, got to be mine

[Verse 1]
Sadness had been
Close as my next of kin
Then Happy came one day
Chased my blues away

[Chorus]
My life began when Happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was

[Verse 2]
Happy, that's you
You made my life brand new
Lost as a little lamb was I
'Til you came in

[Chorus]
My life began when Happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
('Til now)

[Verse 3]
Where have I been?
What lifetime was I in?
Suspended between time and space
Lonely until

[Chorus]
Happy came smiling up at me
Sadness had no choice but to flee
I said a prayer so silently
Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
'Til now

[Outro]
Happy
Yeah, yeah, happy
La-la-la la, la la la la

Yeah, happy
Ooh, happy

[Chorus]
They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love

[Verse 1]
They say that love is a word
A word we have only heard
But can't begin to know the meaning of
And yet we are not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then some day they may recall
We were not too young at all

[Chorus]
They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love

[Verse 2]
And yet we are not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then some day they may recall
We were not too young at all

[Chorus]
You better stop
You are dogging around
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Because if you do not stop
I am going to have to put you down

[Verse 1]
I cannot take it much longer
My heart is getting weak
It is not getting any stronger
You keep me so upset
My head is in a whirl
But if you want to be, yeah
Be my girl

[Chorus]
You better stop
You are dogging around
You know what I am talking about
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If you do not stop
I am gonna have to put you down

Of all things looking new
Morning glow is long past due

We've been together for such a long time
Now music, music and me

In your mind you will find
A world of sweet harmony

Ain't lettin' nothin' in the world, darling
Turn us around
'Cause we're almost there
We're almost there

Thought the sun shine brighter without saying goodbye
There's a card in my hand
Tears fall like rain
I want to come home again
I want you to

[Chorus]
Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That is with you baby
Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That is with you baby

Take me back, forgive me
Take me back where I belong
If you can, if you can find it
In your heart to forgive me

You'll remember a place
Someone touching your face
You'll come back and you'll look around you
One day in your life
You'll remember the love you found here

You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day

When you find that you are always waiting
For the love we used to share
Just call my name, and I'll be there

For the love we used to share
Just call my name, and I'll be there

This is the kind of magic you bring, oh

The dreams that we're dreaming
Have time to come true

[Chorus]
'Cause we've got forever
And forever is meant for so very few, mm

[Bridge]
We shall have music
We shall have rhyme
We shall have each other
One minute after the end of time

Then we'll add up the pleasures
And treasure the sums
Caring is sharing
The cake and the crumbs

How lucky we are to be
Me and you

And forever is meant for so very few

[Chorus]
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away

I told my mama how I feel about your power
Your love can heal, can no doctor's remedy
Ever do what you do for me

Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Eeny weeny teeny bit of your love
Baby it is all I need, it is all I need

Since the day I have been loving you
I can't catch a cold, I can't catch the flu
The sweet loving you have been giving me
Has become my daily need

Just a little of your love, every day
It is all I need, that is all I need
Just a little bit, baby
That's all I need, that's all I need

So do not send no doctor to my door
Because Doctor John has been here before
Do not you send him, just come yourself
Bring your lovin' and nothing else

Ooh just a, just a
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Just a little bit of you every day

You are there like the laughter of a child
When I need just a smile
Suddenly the sun shines for a while

Everywhere sounds of love are everywhere
And my heart sings along
Thanks to you I finally got a song

[Chorus]
Because you are there
You are there
You are there somewhere
Each time my world seems like it is falling down
Things look up just having you around
So every night I say a prayer
Just because you are there

[Verse 2]
Like a rainbow after rain
Like the night follows day
You are the answer to the prayers I say

[Chorus]
And you are there
You are there
You are there somewhere
No matter where I go or what I do
You are there to help me see it through
So every night I say a prayer
Just because you are there

Ooh, you are there, somewhere
And as the years go by we will stay as true
What you are for me I will be for you
And every night I will say a prayer
Just because you are there

Ooh, you are there
Everywhere, you are there

And in the house she blows them away
Faded in the morning time

I wrote you a hundred times before
Knowing how I feel, I'll write a hundred more"

[Verse 2]
"Dear Michael (Michael, Michael)
Every time (She wrote) your record's on, Michael (Michael, Michael)
I close my eyes (She wrote) and sing along
Dreaming you're singing to me"

[Chorus]
And then, she wrote: "Michael, I love you
I've held the tears back long as I can
I'm sealing my feelings in this envelope
'Cause I wanna be more than just your number one fan"

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna answer your letter (Michael, Michael)
I'll start beginning (She wrote) with the ABC's of loving you (Michael, Michael)
Your letter (She wrote) really touched my heart
I've been dreaming of
Meeting the picture that you sent along
Signed with all your love

[Break]
(Michael, Michael)
(I wrote you)
(She wrote)
I'm going to write you back, ooh
I promise you that

[Outro]
Girl, I think I love you
(Michael, Michael) (I wrote you, she wrote)
Hurry, hurry, mister postman (Won't you write me back?)
(Please write me back) Take my letter, tell her I love her
(Michael, Michael) (I wrote you, she wrote)
Hurry, hurry mister postman (Won't you write me back?)
(Please write me back) Take my letter, tell her I love her
(Michael, Michael) Yeah
(I wrote you) (She wrote)
I'm gonna write you back
I promise you that
Tell her I love her

(Ouch)

[Intro]
If I had my way, girl
I'd never leave you for a minute
But things don't always turn out
The way we want 'em to
So, while I'm away, now
I want you to remember
How much I love you
I love you, I love you

[Verse 1]
Let this love lift you up
When you're feeling blue
Wherever I go, I will be loving you
Think of me when you see
Places we once shared
Whatever I do, someday I'll need you there
Ooh

[Chorus]
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you

[Verse 2]
Even though we both know
You're not in my arms
Wherever I go, you're always in my heart
Ooh, just you ask, I'll come back
Though we're miles apart
Whatever I do, I'll come to where you are
Oh

[Chorus]
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you

Oh, wherever I go, whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you
Don't you worry, darling

Wherever I go, whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you
Don't you worry, baby

Wherever I go, whatever I do

[Verse 1]
I'm going to hide from the rain
I am tired of running 'round while these nuns eat my grain
Ransacking, wolfpacking rats in a cult of fame, so lame
Secret Christians are all the same

[Verse 2]
Don't be grumpy and cold
If you want to, I can burn up a hole in this coal
Don't be surprised if it warms up right when we die tonight
Secret Christians are not too bright

[Outro]
Na na-na  na na na
Na na-na na na na
Na, na-na, na na-na, na
Na, na-na, na, na-na
Na, na na, na, na-na, na-na
Na na na-na-na-na  na-na na

[Verse 1]
I’m fascinated by your stare
I’ll rip through all your fancy clothes
I want to shop for your underwear (Oh, yeah)
I want to do it all so close

[Hook]
Dominate it, work it, work it (Do it)
Dominate it, do it (Do it, do it, hypnotize me)
Dominate it, work it, work it
Dominate it, do it (Oh, come on)
Dominate it, work it, work it (Do it)
Dominate it, do it (Do it, do it, hypnotize me)
Dominate it, work it, work it
Dominate it, do it (Oh, come on)

[Chorus]
Why don't you take it easy on me?
Take it easy on me, take it easy on me (Take it easy on me)

Dominate it, work it, work it (Come on)
Dominate it, do it (And take it easy on me)

[Verse 2]
Baby, I can make it worth your while
Don't need your telephone number, I'm right here now
Eyes light up like the 4th of July
When I look right through your dress
I want your cherry pie (Your cherry pie)
Come here, but take your time (Yeah)
I know your time is valuable, baby, but so is mine
Don’t let this chance go by
And I get that you one badass chick, but I’m that guy

[Chorus]
Why don't you take it easy on me? (Why don't you)
Take it easy on me, take it easy on me (Take it easy, why don't you)
Why don’t you take it easy on me? (Take it easy)
Take it easy on me, take it easy (Oh)

[Hook]
Dominate it, work it, work it
Dominate it, do it (Do it)
Dominate it, work it, work it
Dominate it, do it (And take it easy on me)
Dominate it, work it, work it (Come on)
Dominate it, do it (Do it)
Dominate it, work it, work it (Come on)
Dominate it, do it (And take it easy on me)

[Verse 3]
Baby, I ain't never been the type to dance
But tonight may be the night
I get on it
A few shots of the Patron, I lose my mind (This sick)
And I might lose my balance
Because I hit that blunt too many times
Come down, is what I have to tell myself (Yeah)
Cause when I get in my zone
I can't even see nobody else
I'm standing on furniture
And my outfit's so fly (Oh)
They telling me I should relax
But I'm like, why?

[Chorus]
Why don't you take it easy on me? (Why don't you)
Take it easy on me, take it easy on me (Take it easy, take it easy)
Why don’t you take it easy on me?
Take it easy on me, take it easy
Take it easy, come on

[Hook]
Dominate it, work it, work it
Dominate it, do it (Do it)
Dominate it, work it, work it
Dominate it, do it (And take it easy on me)
Dominate it, work it, work it (Take it easy)
Dominate it, do it (Do it)
Dominate it, work it, work it (Come on)
Dominate it, do it (And take it easy on me)

[Outro]
Take it easy, ha (Do it)
Take it easy, oh yeah
Take it easy
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, come on (Do it)

Well, then you must be seein' (Woo!)
Some other guy instead of me (Ooh!)

[Verse 1]
I'm only floating on the breeze
Sweet dreams are falling from the trees
I'm on my knees
I'm fumbling through my pockets for my keys
One at a time, mama please

[Verse 2]
I'm only lonely through the night
I'm sweating, fretting through the flight
I'm out of sight
I'm crying, I am flying like a kite
One at a time, out of sight

[Bridge]
One at a time
One at a time
One at a time
One at a time

[Verse 1]
I'm only floating on the breeze
Sweet dreams are falling from the trees
I'm on my knees
I'm fumbling through my pockets for my keys
One at a time, mama please

[Outro]
I'm only lonely through the night

[Intro]
Overcast in the good of the night, it's alright
Moles are crashing out of the dirt
Oil is in the cradle of its golden moon tonight
Bones are broken, veins are open
All done in the opposite of afternoon

[Verse 1]
Overcast in the good of the night, it's alright
Moles are crashing out of the dirt
Oil is in the cradle of its golden moon tonight
Open eyes in the gardens of sight, it's alright
Only when you crawl in the dirt
Frozen invitations to a solvent gloom tonight

[Chorus]
Bones are broken, veins are open
All done in the opposite of afternoon

[Verse 2]
Only gods in a mountain at night, it's alright
Fools and molten virgins alike
Rolling in the naked and the fragrant doom tonight
Solarizing a portrait of light, it's alright
Woven sparkled cotton and void
Open elevation of the cult of... tonight

[Chorus]
Bones are broken, veins are open
All done in the opposite of afternoon
Bones are broken, veins are open
All done in the opposite of afternoon

[Chorus]
Bones are broken, veins are open
All done in the opposite of afternoon
Bones are broken, veins are open
All done in the opposite of afternoon

[Verse 1]
Something wicked this way comes
We don't like to fall, but when we come down, we lose it all
Then we open someone new
We eat their bones and wonder why they have no bones left

[Chorus]
Maybe one day, we'll find we have
No need for a leader

[Verse 2]
I watch the faces on a screen
No question what I'll have to pay for my apathy
Can you feel it on your face?
The winds of change are a lot unfriendlier these days

[Chorus]
Maybe one day, we'll find we have
No need for a leader

[Verse 1]
Something wicked this way comes
We don't like to fall, but when we come down, we lose it all
Then we open someone new
We eat their bones and wonder why they have no bones left

[Chorus]
Maybe one day, we'll find we have
No need for a leader

[Verse 1]
He wants to give her everything she wants
All of the sins in her mind
All of her enemies fallen and cryin'
All of the tear drops on her tongue

[Pre-Chorus]
It's in her conscience
That whatever God gives
Her someone to mourn
Who cares what God is?
Or what a guitar is?
Or that you were born?

[Chorus]
Monki, Monki
He wanted you
Monki, Monki
He wanted you

[Verse 2]
And when he stops saying things you want to hear
Pull up your knickers in a mood
He wants to outclass these crass devotees
Deletes your picture from his phone

[Pre-Chorus]
It's in his conscience
That musical notes give him
Someone to mourn
Who cares what God is?
Or what a guitar is?
Or that you were born?

[Chorus]
Monki, Monki
She wanted you
Monki, Monki
She wanted you

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
It's in his conscience
That musical notes give him
Someone to mourn
Who cares what God is?
Or what a guitar is?
Or that you were born?

[Chorus]
Monki, Monki
She wanted you
Monki, Monki
She wanted you

[Verse 1]

Late at night when the wind is free

[Verse 2]

Do-do-do-do-doot-do-do-do-do (Woohoo)
Do-do-do-do-doot-do-do-do-do

[Verse 1]
Looking in my mirror
Took me by surprise
I can't help but see you
Running often through my mind
Helpless like a baby
Sensual disguise
I can't help but love you
It's getting better all the time

[Chorus]
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no

[Verse 2]
Love to run my fingers
Softly while you sigh
Love came and possessed you
Bringing sparkles to your eyes
Like a trip to heaven
Heaven is the prize
And I'm so glad I found you, yeah
You're an angel in disguise

[Chorus]
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no

[Post-Chorus]
And I'm so glad I found you, yeah
You're an angel in disguise

[Chorus]
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
Wouldn't help it, no no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
Wouldn't help it, no no no

[Chorus: Patti Austin, Michael Jackson]
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the bein' in love that makes me cry, cry
You think we're fallin' in love
Got me fallin' in love
(Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry)

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
You're not like anybody I ever knew
But that don't mean that I don't know where we are
And though I found myself attracted to you
This time I am trying not to go too far, 'cause

[Pre-Chorus 1: Michael Jackson]
No matter how it starts, it ends the same
Someone's always doin' someone more
Trading in the passion for that taste of pain
It's only gonna happen again

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
(All night)

[Verse 2: Patti Austin]
And though I am tryin' not to look in your eyes
Each time I do, they kind of burn right through me
Don't wanna lay down in a bed full of lies
And yet my heart is sayin', "Come and do me!"

[Pre-Chorus 2: Michael Jackson]
Now we're just a web of mystery
A possibility of more to come
I'd rather leave the bed to see of what might be
But here I go fallin' again

[Chorus: Michael Jackson, Patti Austin & Both]
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
Over you, over you (All night)
It's the fallin' in love (You got me fallin' in love)
Got me fallin' in love (Being in love makes me)
Cry, Cry, Cry

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm fallin' in love (I'm fallin')
I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin'

I'm fallin' in love (I'm fallin')
I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm fallin' in love (I'm fallin')
I'm fallin'

[Verse 1]
There's a stampede
And it's comin' after you
You can take it
If you only let your feelings through

[Pre-Chorus]
So DJ, spin the sounds
There ain't no way that you're gonna let us down
Gonna dance, gonna burn this disco out

[Chorus]
Groove all night
Keep the boogie alright

Won't you rock across the room

[Chorus]
I'm so gone
Ayo, I get so gone
I said, I'm so gone

[Verse 1]
Uh, uh
Ayo, I'm so gone, somewhere in a cloud
The room is filled with smoke but the blunt still goin' 'round
We blowin' pounds, I'll admit I'm just a weed head
My mom say by age 40 I'ma be dead
But I live free in a world that's make-believe
To say the least, I be goin' like I'm off the leash
I'm pretty chief, roll another four-a-piece
Hit the crib, get it Jerm, have him sendin' me some heat
The beats I speak on, I'm spittin' like my teeth gone
Off an L a couple hundred feet long
Cop it by the pound, smoke until the weed gone
That's when you'll find me goin'
I'm so gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, feelin' like I can't go
On, on, on, on
On, on, on, boy, this weed so bomb
I been high for so long, long

[Chorus]
I'm so gone
Ayo, I get so gone
I said, I'm so gone

[Verse 2]
Uh, uh
And this purple got me paralyzed, the reddest pair of eyes
That you ever seen, never wearin' Visine
I ain't tryna hide it (Nah)
See, I'ma superhero, Mary Jane just my sidekick (What?)
Yeah, something I can't live without, girl, you got me lifted
Those who tell me not to smoke, it's really not your business (Haha)
They say I'm so young and so gifted
But fuck it, more blunts gettin' twisted (Uh-huh)
I love it, I'm so drunk, so piffy
Find me at the spot with mo' skunk, no middies
Y'all know this blueberry so pretty
I'll only come if Mary Jane can go with me
Haha

[Chorus]
I'm so gone (Haha)
Ayo, I get so gone
The Sour Hour
Sour Hour
I said, I'm so gone
TreeJay, what up, boy? 'Bout to get Chik-Fil

[Verse 1]
Well, there is something about watching a crime
It makes me want to go out and make it all mine
It's something about seeing you fight
It makes me want to go out tonight

[Hook]
I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
To fall into
Yeah, it's true

[Verse 2]
There's something about seeing him die
That puts it all into perspective and I
Want to stay home, be left alone
Someone make my mind up so I don't have to decide

[Hook]
I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
To fall into
Yeah, I do

[Verse 3]
There's some reason why I can't sit still
Every waking moment I feel so unfulfilled
I try to lie down, but I don't know how
Baby, when I'm sleeping, it feels less like I am dreaming

[Chorus]
Oh, my god
I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
It's got me down
On my knees

[Verse 4]
There's a fear I have of feeling real bad
I'm fine now, if I find out that I'm not I'll be sad
I try to quiet the thoughts in the night
Oh, they got me thinking, I'd be happier just drinking

[Outro]
It's not true
And I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
It's got me down
On my knees
Oh, no
I got a bad disease
Will no one help me please?
Not even you?

[Verse 1]
In my old town
There is no street with my name
No crown, I am no king
And the kids they don't all know my name
It's like nothing has changed

[Hook]
Life takes you up and down
And life spins you all around
The good life
I know I made it
The good life
I know I made it with you

[Verse 2]
In my own town
My friends are saying
What happened to you
We thought you'd make it
And you'd be driving Bentleys
And living the good life for us all
My father says
When will you make it
My mother says
You'll learn to fake it
But I'm not you and you're not me
But I'm as good as I can be, baby

[Hook]
Life takes you up and down
And life spins you all around
The good life
I know I made it
The good life
I know I made it with you
Life takes you up and down
And life spins you all around
The good life
I know I made it
The good life
I know I made it with you

Oh I know that it’s the good life
I can see it in your eyes
Oh I know that it’s the good life
I can see it in your eyes

And I say
I know I made it
The good life
Open your eyes
Your friends, your lover
Your soul, your mind
It's right there baby all the time

[Hook]
Life takes you up and down
And life spins you all around
The good life
I know I made it
The good life
I know I made it with you
Life takes you up and down
And life spins you all around
The good life
I know I made it
The good life
I know I made it with you

Oh I know that
It's the good life
I can see it baby

Oh I know that I
It's the good life
I wanna live the good life

Oh I know that
It's the good life
I can see it babe
Now I see it babe
Oh I know that
It's the good life
I wanna live the good life

[Verse 1]
The markings on your surface
Your speckled face, yeah
Large crystals hang from your ears
Are they here
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind
Maybe I'm a fool
And maybe I should move
To settle, two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
I'm not brave
So what would you recommend I do?
I'm living in the city, yes
Forgetting there's a jungle outside
Nah
I'm living in an ideal
An idea from another man's mind (Mind)
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind
I'd rather go to jail
I'd rather try hell
Or I could be a fool
And settle, for a place with a nice view (nice view, nice view)
(For a place with a nice view)

I would do anything for you
Yes, I would do anything for you

Fat as hell, I’m in cake mode
Too overweight, lift up my shirt and look at all of these bankrolls
Tell the waitress just to keep them bottles coming

Look like I robbed a bank
I set it off like Queen Latifah, cause I'm living single
I'm feeling cautious, I ain't scream when they served a subpoena
I heard that he the leader, come follow my tribe today
I fucked her now he heated, he feel some type of way

[Verse 1]
She got your number, ah
She know your game, ah
She put you under, ah
It's so insane, ah
Since you seduced her, ah
How does it feel? Ah
To know that woman, ah
Is out to kill

[Refrain]
Every night stance is like taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you're going to get it
Ah, every hot man is out taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it

[Pre-Chorus]
To escape the world, I've got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)
She seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
But I just can't take it
Just can't break it

[Chorus]
Susie got your number and Susie ain’t your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number and Susie says it's right

[Verse 2]
She got your number, ah
How does it feel? Ah
To know this stranger, ah
Is about to kill, ah
She got yo' baby, ah
It happened fast, ah

Erase the past (Ah)

Every night stance is like taking a chances (Ah)

Susie's got your number
Susie ain’t your friend (Ah, it's goin' down, baby)
Look who took you under, she put seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife (It's goin' down, baby)
Susie's got your number (Ah)
Susie says it's right

[Outro]
It was blood on the dance floor
(Blood on the dance floor)

(Blood on the dance floor)
And I just can't take it
The girl won't break it
Hoo!

[Verse 1]
Like a comet
Blazing 'cross the evening sky
Gone too soon

[Verse 2]
Like a rainbow
Fading in the twinkling of an eye
Gone too soon

[Chorus]
Shiny and sparkly
And splendidly bright
Here one day
Gone one night

[Verse 3]
Like the loss of sunlight
On a cloudy afternoon
Gone too soon

[Verse 4]
Like a castle
Built upon a sandy beach
Gone too soon

[Verse 5]
Like a perfect flower
That is just beyond your reach
Gone too soon

[Chorus]
Born to amuse
To inspire, to delight
Here one day
Gone one night

[Verse 6]
Like a sunset
Dying with the rising of the moon
Gone too soon

[Outro]
Gone too soon

[Verse 1]
There'll be no darkness tonight
Lady, our love will shine (Lighting the night)
Just put your trust in my heart
And meet me in paradise (Now is the time)
Girl, you're every wonder in this world to me
A treasure time won't steal away

[Chorus]
So listen to my heart
Lay your body close to mine
Let me fill you with my dreams
I can make you feel alright
And, baby, through the years
Going to love you more each day
So I promise you tonight
That you will always be the lady in my life

[Verse 2]
Lay back in my tenderness
Let's make this a night we won't forget
Girl, I need your sweet caress, oh
Reach out to a fantasy
Two hearts in a beat of ecstasy
Come to me, girl

[Chorus]
And I will keep you warm through the shadows of the night
Let me touch you with my love
I can make you feel so right
And, baby, through the years even when we're old and gray
I will love you more each day
'Cause you will always be the lady in my life

[Bridge]
Stay with me
I want you to stay with me
I need you by my side
Don't you go nowhere
(Ooh, girl, let me keep you warm)
Let me keep you warm
(You are the lady in my life)
You're my lady
(Feel you with the sweetest love)
I want to squeeze you
(Always the lady in my life)
I want to touch you, baby
(Lay back in my tenderness)

All through the night

[Outro]

(You are the lady in my life)

[Verse 1]
She's from a world
Of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime
Little children laughing
I'm from a world
Of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking
She kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away

[Verse 2]
I was the clown
And she was the dancer
We both knew it wouldn't work
But we took our chances
What I can't recall
Is if there was a girl at all
Or was it my imagination?
I still remember
All of those faces
And now all I have is memories

[Chorus]
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away

[Bridge]
Two different people
In love for an instant
To see that the circus came today
Sometimes I can hear the calliope
And I can hear her calling me

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Don't you know?
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away

[Outro]
I lost my heart (Lost my heart)
I lost (On the carousel)
I lost my girl (To a circus girl)
Who left my heart in pieces
(Lost my heart) Lost my heart
(On the carousel) Lost my girl (To a circus girl)
Who ran away
I lost (Lost my heart)
I lost my girl (On the carousel)
Ooh, oh, lost, oh, lost (To a circus girl)
I lost
I lost my heart (Lost my heart)
I lost (On the carousel)
I lost my girl (To a circus girl)

[Verse 1]
Sister don't read, she'll never know
What about love?
Living a Christian song
What do we care, if she runs away?
What about love?
What about all I pray?

Go through the words, she knows a priest
What about God?
Living is all I see
What will you care, think she will say?
What about love?
That's all I pray

[Chorus]
Those abortion papers
Signin' your name against the Word of God
Those abortion papers
Think about love, I’d like to have my child

[Verse 2]
Sister confused, she went along
What about love?
What about all I saw?
Biding her time, breathing the words
Singing a song, reciting a Bible verse

Father's confused, mother despair
Brother's in curse
What about all I've seen?
You know the line, you came alone
What about heart?
That’s all I've known

[Chorus]
Those abortion papers
Signin' your name against the Word of God
Those abortion papers
Think about love, I'd like to have my child
Those abortion papers (Ooh!)
Signin' your name against the Word of God
Those abortion papers
Think about love, I'd like to have my child
(chh chh - chh chh chh)
(chh chh chh)

[Verse 3]
Look at my words
What do they say?
Look in my heart
Burning is all heartbreak

What do you get?
What do you say?
What about love?
I feel my sin

[Chorus]
Those abortion papers
Signin' your name against the Word of God
Those abortion papers
Think about love, I'd like to have my child
Those abortion papers (Ooh!)
Think about love, I'd like to have my child
(Ooh!) (chh chh - chh chh chh) (Ooh!)

[Bridge]
She could have been grateful
Where will she go?
What will she do
Through the world?

[Verse 4]
Sister don't know, where will she go?
What about love?
What about all I saw?
What will you care?
Don't be so confused
Love all the things
It's just the things I do

[Chorus]
Those abortion papers
Signin' your name against the Word of God
Those abortion papers
Think about love, I'd like to have my child

[Outro]
Those abortion papers

[Fade]
Baby don't make me (fly away)
Baby don't make me (baby)

[Verse 1]
They say I'm different
They don't understand
But there's a bigger problem
That's much more in demand
You've got world hunger
Not enough to eat
So there's really no time
To be trippin' on me

You've got school teachers
Who don't wanna teach
You've got grown people
Who can't write or read
You got strange diseases
Ah but there's no cure
You got many doctors
That aren't so sure
So tell me

[Chorus]
Why you wanna trip on me?
Why you wanna trip on me?
Stop trippin'

[Verse 2]
We have got more problems
Than we will ever need
You got gang violence
And bloodshed on the street
You got homeless people
With no food to eat
With no clothes on their back
And no shoes for their feet

We've got drug addiction
In the minds of the weak
We've got so much corruption
Police brutality
We've got streetwalkers
Walking into darkness
Tell me
What are we doing
To try to stop this?

[Chorus]
Why you wanna trip on me?
Why you wanna trip on me?
Why you wanna trip on me?
Why you wanna trip on me?
Ooh stop trippin'
Yeah stop trippin'
Everybody just stop trippin'

[Chorus]
Why you wanna trip on me?
Why you wanna trip on me?
Why you wanna trip on me?
Why you wanna trip on me?
Stop trippin'
Why you wanna trip on me?
Why you wanna trip on me?
Why you wanna trip on me?
Why you wanna trip on me?
Ooh stop trippin'
Yeah stop trippin'
Everybody just stop trippin'

[Outro]
Stop trippin'
Stop trippin'
Stop trippin'
Stop trippin'

[Intro]
There is something I have to say to you
If you promise you'll understand
I cannot contain myself when in your presence
I'm so humble
Touch me, don't hide our love
Woman to man

[Verse 1]
She's just a lover who's doing me by
It's worth the giving, it's worth the try
You cannot cleave it or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it, you cannot burn it

[Chorus]
She wants to give it
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (Dare me)
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (She wants to give it)
She wants to give it (Yeah)
Oh, she wants to give it
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it

[Verse 2]
It's just a feeling, you have to soothe it
You can't neglect it, you can't abuse it
It's just desire, you cannot waste it
Then, if you want it
Then, won't you taste it

[Chorus]
She wants to give it
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (Dare me)
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (She wanna get it)
She wants to give it (Yeah)
Oh, she wants to give it
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it

[Post-Chorus]
One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust to woman to man
So open the door and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move, set me free
Oh, because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby (Oh)
Just promise me whenever we say (And we get it)
Or whatever we do to each other
For now we will be making a vow (Never knew)
To just keep it in the closet

[Verse 3]
If you can get it, is it worth the try?
I really want it, I can't deny
It's just desire, I really love it
'Cause if it's aching, you have to rub it

[Chorus]
She wants to give it
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (Dare me)
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (Get it)
She wants to give it (Yeah)
Oh, she wants to give it (Dare me)
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it

[Post-Chorus]
Just open the door and you will see
This passion burns inside of me
Don't say to me you'll never tell
Touch me there, make the move, cast the spell
Oh, because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby
That makes me want
Just promise me whatever we say
Or do to each other (Whatever we do)
For now we'll make a vow
To just keep it in the closet
Because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
Because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
There's something about you, baby
That makes me want
Just promise me whatever we say
Or whatever we do to each other (Whatever we do)
For now we'll make a vow
To just keep it in the closet

[Chorus]
She wants to give it (Dare me)
Keep it in the closet
She wants to give it (Dare me)
Keep it in the closet
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (Dare me)
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it
She wants to give it
Dare me
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it
She wants to give it (Keep it in the closet)
She wants to give it
She wants to give it (Keep it in the closet)
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (Dare me)

[Intro]
I don't know, bet you wanna try
Every time you see

[Verse 1]
Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Do you remember, back in the fall?
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?

[Verse 2]
Do you remember how we used to talk?
You know, we'd stay on the phone at night till dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like, "I love you so, I'll never let you go"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Do you remember, back in the spring?
Every morning, birds would sing
Do you remember those special times?
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?

[Bridge]
Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now baby

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
(Remember, my baby)
Do you remember the time?
('Cause I remember)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
(All in my mind, girl)
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
(Remember, my baby)

[Breakdown]
(Remember the time)
Hoo!
(Remember the time)
Do you remember, girl?
(Remember the time)
On the phone, you and me
(Remember the time)
Till dawn, two or three
What about us, girl?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you, do you?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you?
In the park, on the beach
(Remember the time)
You and me, in Spain
What about, what about
(Remember the time)
Grrrrrat, tat tat, tat
Grrrrrat, tat tat
(Remember the time)
Hoo! In the park
(Remember the time)
After dark, do you, do you, do you?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you, do you, did you?
(Remember the time)
Yeah, yeah, hoo!
(Remember the time, remember the time)

[Produced By Teddy Riley]

[Verse 1]
I thought she had to have it
Since the first time she came
Who knows the situation
Mysteries do remain
And now I wonder why
I break down when I cry
Is it something I said
Or is it just a lie? (Is it just a lie)

I try so hard to love you
Some things take time and shame
I think the whole world of you
Your thoughts of me remain
I'll play the fool for you
I'll change the rules for you
Just say it and I'll do
Just make this dream come true (make a dream come true)
If I let her get away
Though I'm begging on my knees
I'll be crying everyday
Knowing the girl that got away

[Hook]
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away

[Verse 2]
I tried to mastermind it
By saying let you be
But everytime I did it
The hurt came back at me
I told you that I need you
A thousand times and why
I played the fool for you
And still you said goodbye (still you said goodbye)

If I let her get away
Then the world will have to see
A fool who lives alone
And the fool who set you free

[Hook]
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away

[Bridge]
I got the feeling, trouble's gotta stop
I got the feeling, she's never gonna try
I got the feeling, she's never gonna stop
I got the feeling but she's never gonna know
My friends thought she's gonna like it
I got the feeling but she's never gonna take it
I got the feeling, her head's all fucked up
I got the feeling, she's out to play
Can't let go
Can't let go

[Hook]
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away

[Intro: Child]
Think about the generations and say that we wanna make it a better place for our children, and our children's children, so that they, they, they know it's a better world for them, and think, if they can make it a better place...

[Verse 1]
There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you will feel there's no hurt or sorrow

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

[Chorus]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Verse 2]
If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss, we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
To make a better world

[Chorus]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Bridge]
And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life?
Would this Earth crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be God's glow

[Verse 3]
We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together, we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into
Ploughshares

[Pre-Chorus 3]
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

[Chorus]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world (Heal the world)
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Post-Chorus]
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Outro: Michael Jackson & Child]
Make a better place (You and for me)
Make a better place (You and for me)
Make a better place (You and for me)
(You and for me)
Heal the world we live in (You and for me)
Save it for our children (You and for me)
Heal the world we live in (You and for me)
Save it for our children (You and for me)
Heal the world we live in (You and for me)
Save it for our children (You and for me)
Heal the world we live in (You and for me)
Save it for our children

[Verse 1]
Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
'Cause I keep kidding 'round
Like a child, but pardon me

[Chorus]
People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the childhood
I've never known

[Verse 2]
Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams
Of conquest and kings on the throne
Before you judge me, try hard to love me
Look within your heart, then ask
Have you seen my childhood?

[Chorus]
People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the childhood (Childhood)
I've never known

[Verse 3]
Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly
Before you judge me, try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had

[Outro]
Have you seen my childhood?

[Verse 1]
I gave her money, I gave her time
I gave her everything inside one heart could find
I gave her passion, my very soul
I gave her promises and secrets so untold

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
And a day we'd live as one
We made our vows we'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?

[Post-Chorus]
Who is it?
Is it a friend of mine?
Who is it?
Is it my brother?
Who is it?
Somebody hurt my soul now
Who is it?
I can't take this stuff no more

[Verse 2]
I am the damned, I am the dead
I am the agony inside the dying head
This is injustice, woe unto thee
I pray this punishment would have mercy on me

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
That we'd live our life as one
We made our vows we'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see, what will I do?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

[Post-Chorus]
Who is it?
It is a friend of mine?
Who is it?
Is it my brother?
Who is it?
Somebody hurt my soul now
Who is it?
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

[Bridge]
Hee-hee, hee-hee
Don't try to pick me
Don't try, quit it
I never was, I never would
Just won't stop
Don't bother me
Don't bother me

[Pre-Chorus]
Who is it?
It is a friend of mine?
Who is it?
To me, I'm bothered
Who is it?
Somebody hurt my soul now
Who is it?
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter (Hee-hee)
And it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Body)
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter (Don't bother me)
And it doesn't seem right (Da da da da)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night (Think of another brother)
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered every day
And she didn't leave a letter
She just upped and ran away (You can really say I'm lonely)
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee!)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Don't be, don't be, don't be judging)
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me (Don't be, don't do)
Did she find in someone else? (Can't take it 'cause I'm lonely)
And it doesn't seem to matter (Don't bother me)
And it doesn't seem right (This won't cut it)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night (Think of another brother)
Don't you judge of my composure (Don't be judging)
'Cause I'm bothered every day (Don't be, don't be)
And she didn't leave a letter
She just upped and ran away (Can't you really feel I'm lonely?)
And it doesn't seem to matter (Hee-hee!)
And it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee!)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night (She don't, she don't want me)
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered every day (She don't, she don't, she don't need it)
And she didn't leave a letter (She don't, she don't want it)
She just upped and ran away (Is it my brother?)
And it doesn't seem to matter (Don't bother me, you just couldn't)
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune (Da da, da da, da da, da)
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Hee!)
'Cause I'm lying to myself (Hee!)
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else? (I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely)

[Verse 1]
So it's over
This time, I know it's gone
Saltwater
Tasted it too long
I only know I'm wrong
Now I know it's gone

[Hook]
Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone

[Verse 2]
So it's over
This time, you're flying on
This time, I know no song
Can't stop its lonely burn
Can't stop it slowly going

[Hook]
Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone

[Hook]
Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone
Oh, we have slowly gone

[Outro]
Can we pour some water on?

[Verse 1]
Speculate to break the one you hate
Circulate the lie you confiscate
Assassinate and mutilate
As the hounding media in hysteria
Who's the next, for you to resurrect?
JFK exposed the CIA
Truth be told the grassy knoll
As the blackmail story in all your glory

[Pre-Chorus]
It's slander
You say it's not a sword
But with your pen you torture men
You'd crucify the Lord
And you don't have to read it, read it
And you don't have to eat it, eat it
To buy it is to feed it, feed it
Then why do we keep fooling ourselves?

[Chorus]
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Though everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
They say he's homosexual

[Verse 2]
In the hood
Frame him if you could
Shoot to kill
To blame him if you will
If he dies sympathize
Such false witnesses
Damn self-righteousness
In the black
Stab me in the back
In the face
To lie and shame the race
Heroine and Marilyn
As the headline stories of
All your glory

[Pre-Chorus]
It's slander
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
And you don't go and buy it, buy it
And they won't glorify it, 'fy it
To read it sanctifies it, 'fies it
Then why do we keep fooling ourselves

[Chorus]
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
She's blonde and she's bisexual

[Pre-Chorus]
Scandal
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
And you don't go and buy it, buy it
And they won't glorify it, 'fy it
To read it sanctifies it, 'fies it
Why do we keep fooling ourselves
Slander
You say it's not a sin
But with your pen you torture men
But why do we keep fooling ourselves

[Chorus]
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Though everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
You're so damn disrespectable

[Verse 1]
He got kicked in the back
He say that he needed that
He hot willed in the face
Keep daring to motivate
He say one day you will see
His place in world history
He dares to be recognized
The fires deep in his eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many struggles must there be
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan
Everybody sing

[Chorus]
Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty

[Verse 2]
Don't let no one get you down
Keep moving on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self-motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history

[Pre-Chorus]
How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand
Everybody sing

[Chorus]
Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world

[Bridge]
How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers
And leave one family oh

[Chorus]
Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

[Outro]
A soldier dies
A mother cries
The promised child shines in a baby's eyes
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world

[Chorus]
What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the Blue Gangsta
What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine
The Blue Gangsta

[Verse 1]
What you gonna do?
'Cause I'm gonna get to you
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
All the things you said
And the things you done to me
You can no longer make me cry

[Pre-Chorus]
Look what you done to me, baby
I can no longer smile, baby
And I've waited so long, just to carry on
I'm the Blue Gangsta

[Chorus]
What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the Blue Gangsta
What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine (I can never fall in love)
The Blue Gangsta

You ain't a friend of mine
Look what you put me through

You ain't a friend of mine (I can never fall in love)
The Blue Gangsta

[Verse 2]
You tricked me nine to five, lovin' you's a crime
People tellin' me, you've got another guy
I've been abused, watch me light the fuse
Said you'd be my wife, nothin' but big lies

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't know what I've done, everything you've done
Things you've done to me, are comin' back to you
You know just what I've done, the things you've done to me
I'm the Blue Gangsta

[Chorus]
What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine (Oh no)
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the Blue Gangsta (I'm the Blue Gangsta)
What you gonna do?

What you gonna do? (Oh no)
You ain't a friend of mine (I can never fall in love)
The Blue Gangsta

[Bridge]
See, I am so amused to the things you said
And the things you done done to me
There is nothin' in this world to make me change
(Yeah, ahh)
(Yeah, ahh)
The Blue Gangsta

[Chorus]
What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine (What you gonna do?)
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the Blue Gangsta
(Look what you put me through, baby)
What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine (I never wanna fall in love)
The Blue Gangsta
What you gonna do? (What you gonna do?)

Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the Blue Gangsta (Yeah, ah)
What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine (Oh no, no)
The Blue Gangsta

[Verse 1]
Somebody killed little Susie
The girl with the tune
Who sings in the daytime at noon
She was there screaming
Beating her voice in her doom
But nobody came to her soon

[Chorus]
A fall down the stairs
Her dress torn
Oh the blood in her hair
A mystery so sullen in air
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh the blood in her hair

[Verse 2]
Everyone came to see
The girl that now is dead
So blind stare the eyes in her head
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said
This girl lived in vain
Her face bear such agony, such strain

[Chorus]
But only the man from next door
Knew Little Susie and how he cried
As he reached down
To close Susie's eyes
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh the blood in her hair

[Bridge]
It was all for God's sake
For her singing the tune
For someone to feel her despair
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed
Then to scream out
And nobody's there
She knew no one cared

[Verse 3]
Father left home, poor mother died
Leaving Susie alone
Grandfather's soul too had flown
No one to care
Just to love her
How much can one bear
Rejecting the needs in her prayers

[Chorus]
Neglection can kill
Like a knife in your soul
Oh it will
Little Susie fought so hard to live
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
So young and so fair

[Chorus]
Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by
If you smile
With your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just

[Verse 1]
Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just

[Chorus]
Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by
If you smile
Through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

[Verse 2]
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

[Verse 1]
If you called out loud
Would it get inside
Through the heart of your surrender
To your alibis?
And you can say the words
Like you understand
But the power's in believing
Give yourself a chance

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Because you can
Climb the highest mountain
Swim the deepest sea, hee
All you need is the will to want it
And a, little self-esteem

[Chorus]
So keep the faith
Don't let nobody turn you 'round
You got to know when it's good to go
To get your dreams up off of the ground
Keep the faith, baby, yeah
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
Believe in yourself
No matter what it's gonna take
You can be a winner
But you got to keep the faith
Gon' keep it, brother
You got it

[Verse 2]
And when ya think of trust
Does it lead you home
To a place that you only dream of
When you're all alone?
And you can go by the feel
'Stead of circumstance
But the power's in believing
So give yourself a chance

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know that you can
Sail across the water
Float across the sky, high
Any road that you take will get you there
If you'll only try

[Chorus]
So keep the faith (Oh)
Don't let nobody take you down, brother
Just keep your eyes on the prize
And your feet flat on the ground
So keep the faith, baby, yeah
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
I told my brother how to do the thing right
Lift up your head and show the world ya got pride
Go for what you want
Don't let 'em get in your way
You can be better, but you got to keep the faith
Gon' keep it brother
You got it

[Bridge]
I know that keepin' the faith
Means never givin' up on love
But the power that love has to make it right
Makes it, uh, makes it right

[Chorus]
So keep the faith (Go)
Don't let nobody turn you 'round brother
You got to know when it's good to go
To get your dreams up off the ground
So keep the faith, baby, yeah
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out

[Verse 3]
And better stand up and act like you wanna do right
Don't play the fool for the rest of your life
Work on it brother and you'll make it someday
Go for what you want and don't forget the faith
Look at yourself and what ya doin' right now
Stand back a minute just to check yourself out
Straighten out your life and how you're livin' each day
Get yourself together 'cause you got to keep the faith

[Verse 4]
(Keep the faith) Go on
Don't let nobody take you down, brother (Keep the faith)
Just keep your eyes on the prize
And your feet flat on the ground
Keep the faith, baby, yeah
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out

[Verse 5]
Lift up your mind
Before your mind gets blown
Some things in life
You best just leave them alone
Go for what you want
Don't let it get in your way
You can make it happen
But ya got ta keep the faith

[Bridge]
(Keep the faith) Go'n keep it brother
You got to keep the faith
Yeah keep the faith (Keep the faith)
Go'n keep it sister (Keep the faith)
You got to keep the faith
Now, now

[Verse 4]
I showed my brotha
How to do the thing right
Lift up your head
And show the world you got pride
Go for what you want (Keep the faith)
Don't let 'em get in your way
You can be a winner
If you keep'a the faith
Straighten out yourself (Keep your faith)
And get your mind on track (Oh yeah)
Dust off your butt
And get your self-respect back
You've known me too long (Oh yeah)
To know that I don't play (Oh yeah)
Take it like you wanna
But you got to keep the faith

[Outro]
(Keep the faith) Go on
Don't let nobody take you down
Just keep your eyes on the prize (Keep the faith)
And get your feet back on the ground
So keep the faith, baby, yeah (Keep the faith)
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
But til' that day
I say you've got to keep the faith (Hmmm)

[Verse 1]
There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
I know This place is doomed
Because now it's haunting me

[Refrain]
I don't understand it
Hey!
I don't understand it!
Aaow!

[Verse 2]
There's a tapping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no-one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughing and a yawning
Where a restless soul is going

[Refrain]
Don't understand it
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
Hey!
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
Don't understand it!

(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)

[Chorus]
And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to shame my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
You put a knife in my back, shot an arrow in me!
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?
The ghost of jealousy

[Verse 3]
There's a tapping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin in-lay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling

[Refrain]
Don't understand it!
(Gotta ghost gotta break in the walls)
Yeah yeah!
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
Don't understand it!
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)

[Chorus]
And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby
She needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take intrusion
To see me?
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby
She needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
You put a knife in my back, shot an arrow in me!

[Outro]
Dog gone
But there's no doubt about it, piece of mind
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?

[Verse 1]
There's a ghost out in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's coming down the stairs
Then there's screaming in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghosts be hiding everywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna be, exactly what you wanna see
It's you who's taunting me, 'cause you're wanting me
To be the stranger in your life
Am I amusing you, or just confusing you?
Am I the beast you visualized?

And if you want to to see, eccentrialities
I'll be grotesque before your eyes
Let them all materialize

[Chorus]
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh, boy
Is it scary for you, baby?
Is it scary for you?
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you, baby?
Oh, babe

[Verse 2]
There's a creak beneath the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna be exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me to see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes?
A haunting ghostly treat, the foolish trickery
And spirits dancing in the light
But if you came to see, the truth the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start

[Chorus]
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh, boy
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh, boy
So tell me, is it scary for you baby?
Tell me, hoo!
So tell me, is it crazy for you baby?
Am I scary for you?
You know the stranger is you
Am I scary for you?

[Bridge]
Masquerade the heart is
To hide a hurting soul
Trust not what you see of me
Cause the heart reveal the proof, like a mirror reveals the truth
See, the evil one is you

[Chorus]
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh, boy
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is it scary for you? Oh, boy
So tell me am I scary for you baby? (Hoo!)
Am I scary for you, baby? (Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!)
Is scary for you baby? (Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!)
Am I scary for you? (Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!)
(I don't want to talk about it) (Hoo! Hoo!)
(I don't want to talk about it)
(I don't want to talk about it)
(I don't want to talk about it) (Hoo!)

[Chorus]
Is this scary for you, baby? (Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!)
Is this scary for you?
I'm tired of being abused
You know you're scaring me too
I see the evil is you
Is it scary for you, baby? Oh
Oh, baby

[Verse 1]
Feels like a fire
That burns in my heart
Every single moment that we spend apart
I need you around
For every day to start
I haven't left you alone

Something about you
Is there in your eyes
Everything I'm looking for I seem to find
All this time away
Is killing me inside
I need your love in my life

[Chorus]
I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did, when we first met
I wanna fall with you again

[Verse 2]
Fought in a battle, where nobody won
Left ourselves a mountain to be overcome
You can't run away, past the said and done
I need us to carry on

[Chorus]
I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did, when we first met
I wanna fall with you again

[Bridge]
You tried everything, you never thought of before
When you live, in your love
And you give, in your love
Always give up some more
Nothing here means anything
Never did
I can live, I can breathe
I can die in my sleep
Because you're always there in my dreams

[Chorus]
I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did, when we first met
I wanna fall with you again
I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did, when we first met
I wanna fall with you again

Baby, baby, baby
From the day I saw you

There's not a lotta guys are worth my time
Ooh baby, baby, baby
It's gettin' kind of crazy
'Cause you are takin' over my mind

[Chorus]
And it feels like, ooh
But you don't know my name
And I swear, it feels like, ooh (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)

[Verse 2]
Oh, baby, baby, baby
I see us on our first date
You're doin' everything that makes me smile
And when we had our first kiss
It happened on a Thursday
Ooh, it set my soul on fire
Ooh, baby, baby, baby
I can't wait for the first time
My imagination's runnin' wild

[Chorus]
It feels like, ooh
But you don't know my name
And I swear it, baby, it feels like, ooh (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)

[Bridge]
"I'm sayin', he don't even know what he's doin' to me
Got me feelin' all crazy inside
I'm feelin like, "Oww!" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Doin' more than I've ever done for anyone's attention
Take notice of what's in front of you
'Cause did I mention? (Oww!)
You're 'bout to miss a good thing
And you'll never know how good it feels to have all of my affection
And you'll never get a chance to experience my lovin' (Oww!)

[Chorus]
'Cause my lovin' feels like, ooh
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)
And I swear it feels like, ooh (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)

[Post-Chorus]
Will you ever know it?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Will you ever know it?

This is the waitress from the coffee house on 39th and Lennox
You know, the one with the braids?
Yeah, well, I see you on Wednesdays all the time
You come in every Wednesday on your lunch break, I think
And you always order the special, with the hot chocolate
And my manager be tripping and stuff
Talking 'bout we gotta use water
But I always use some milk and cream for you
'Cause I think you're kinda sweet
Anyway, you always got on some fly blue suit
'N your cuff links are shining all bright
So, whatchu do? Oh, word? Yeah, that's interesting
Look, man, I mean, I don't wanna waste your time, but...
I know girls don't usually do this
But I was wondering if maybe we could get together
Outside the restaurant one day?
'Cause I do look a lot different outside my work clothes
I mean, we could just go across the street to the park right here
Wait, hold up, my cell phone's breakin' up, hold up
Can you hear me now? Yeah
So, what day did you say?
Oh yeah, Thursday's perfect, man"

[Chorus]
And it feels like, ooh
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)
Baby, baby, I swear, it's like, ooh
But you don't know my name, no, no, no
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)
And it feels like, ooh
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)

[Outro]
And I swear on my mother and father it feels like...
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)

[Verse 1]
You're just preaching the Bible
And they still speaking ''you're a liar''
And you still deal with the fires
That they make get bigger
Dah dah dah dah dah dah

Dah dah dah dah dah dah, and you
Dah dah dah dah dah dah, dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah

[Pre-Chorus]
Why you wanna get me?
Dreams don't last forever, oh
Why you wanna fix me?
See, if the police don' take it
God forsake it
I can't take it

[Chorus]
Why you stab me in the back?

[Verse 2]
We're so gonna lose it
And she, knows that is the deal
She, I
Dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah dah dah

Dah dah dah dah, people
Dah dah dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah, did I
Dah dah dah dah

[Pre-Chorus]
Why you wanna get me?
This dude won't last forever
Why you wanna hit me?
Oh, babe
If the police don't take it
God forsake it
I'll fall breaking

[Chorus]
Why you stab me in the back?

[Pre-Chorus]
Why you wanna fix me?
Things don't last forever, oh no
Why you wanna get me?
We should be together
Why you wanna hit me?
We should be together
Why you wanna get me?
See, if the police don't take it
God forsake it
I won't take it

[Chorus]
Why you stab me in the back?

Ow!

[Verse 1]

Farewell Angelina
The bells of the crown
Are being stolen by bandits
I must follow the sound
The triangle tingles
The music play slow
But farewell Angelina
The night is on fire
And I must go

[Verse 2]
There is no use in talking
And there's no need for blame
There is nothing to prove
Ev’rything still is the same
A table stands empty
By the edge of the stream
But farewell Angelina
The sky's changing colours
And I must leave

[Verse 3]
The jacks and the queens
They forsake the courtyard
Fifty-two gypsies
Now file past the guards
In the space where the deuce
And the ace once ran wild
Farewell Angelina
The sky is folding
I'll see you after a while

[Verse 4]
See the cross-eyed pirates sitting
Perched in the sun
Shooting tin cans
With a sawed-off shotgun
And the corporals and neighbors
Clap and cheer with each blast
Farewell Angelina
The sky it is trembling
And I must leave fast

[Verse 5]
King Kong, little elves
In the rooftoops they dance
Valentino-type tangos
While the hero's clean hands
Shut the eyes of the dead
Not to embarrass anyone
Farewell Angelina
The sky is flooding over
And I must be gone

[Verse 6]
The camouflaged parrot
He flutters from fear
When something he doesn't know about
Suddenly appears
What cannot be imitated
Perfect must die
Farewell Angelina
The sky's flooding over
And I must go where it is dry

[Verse 7]
Machine guns are roaring
Puppets heave rocks
At misunderstood visions
And at the faces of clocks
Call me any name you like
I will never deny it
But farewell Angelina
The sky is erupting
And I must go where it's quiet

[Verse 1]
Well Lord have mercy
Well Lord have mercy
This ain't no good for me
This ain't no good for me babe
Well Lord have mercy
Well Lord have mercy
Ain't no good for me babe
Tell me what is going down babe

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time I want to say it
It is just too much for me
I don't ever want to say it
Cause it's all blasphemy
Everybody is doing it to somebody's love
In sight of me
I might tell on you
So don't you start no stuff with me

[Chorus]
Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw (oh Lord) (Oh yeah)
I caught your mom she doing a dude
You can't lie cause I was looking right at you (oh Lord)
Stop it
It's too much
Monkey Business going down

[Verse 2]
Well Lord have mercy
Well Lord have mercy
Don't be calling out "Mercy me"
Don't be calling down babe
Said lord have mercy
Even worse the birthday
Don't be calling out "Mercy me"
Don't be going down babe

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time I wanna say it
It is just too much for me
Everybody's doing it to somebody's love
It seems to me
I just can't believe the things I'm seeing
So just let it be
I might tell on you
So don't you start no stuff with me

[Chorus]
Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw (oh lord) (doggone)
I caught your mom she doing a dude
You can't lie cause I was looking right at you (oh lord)
Stop it
It is too much
Monkey business going down

[Bridge]
I read the paper
And I can't believe what's going 'round
Somebody is doing it to
Somebody is up, somebody is down
The government won't pay my taxes
And I'm really mad
My mouth might let it be
So don't you monkey shine with me

[Chorus]
Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw (oh lord) (Hoo) (Hoo-hoo)
I caught your mother she doing a dude
You can't like it that we're looking right at you
(You are dirty, you are dirty, dirty, dirty baby)
Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw (oh Lord) (Hee-hee) (Hoo-hoo)
Your brother didn't make it out the two times two
You sitting 'round here telling how he did it to you
Stop it
It's too much
Monkey business going down

[Outro]
(Going down babe)
Monkey business going down
(You are not satisfied baby)
Monkey business going down
(You want to party)
Monkey business going down
(My business, is your business)
Monkey business going down
(I caught your mother she doing a dude
She can't lie cause I was looking right at you, oh Lord)
Monkey business going down
(And monkey see, monkey do
You can't lie cause I was looking right at you, oh Lord)
Monkey business going down
Your business is my business
Your business is my business
Your business is my business
Monkey business going down
Your business is my business
Your business is my business
Your business
Too much for the kids, baby
It's a monkey business going down
(Oh, babe... Doggone...)

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Lipstick in hand, Tahitian tanned in her painted on jeans
She dreams of fame, she changed her name
To one that fits the movie screen
She's headed for the big time, that means

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
It's true that you may never ever have that chance again
That chance again, babe

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
Westbound Greyhound to Tinseltown to pursue her movie star dreams
And she's giving hot tricks to men just to get in
She was taught that that's not clean
She's headed for the big time, that means

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
It's true that you may never ever have that chance again
That chance again, babe

[Verse 3: Taryll Jackson & Michael Jackson]
She gave up her life to follow her dreams (Again, babe)
Left behind everything for the movie scene
Nothing more she could want, she was determined to follow her plan
She wanted Hollywood, she wanted it bad
Now that she got her dream, she became a star
It all looked so good, but only good from afar
Imprisoned in every paparazzi's camera, every guy wished they could
Now it's back to reality for Ms. Hollywood
Lipstick in hand, Tahitian tanned in her painted on jeans
She dreams of fame, she changed her name
To one that fits the movie screen
She's headed for the big time, that means

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
It's true that you may never ever have that chance again
That chance again, babe
You know it, baby

[Outro: Michael Jackson & Taryll Jackson]
Westbound Greyhound to Tinseltown
To pursue her movie star dreams (That chance again, babe)
She's Hollywood, she's Hollywood
Westbound Greyhound to Tinseltown
To pursue her movie star dreams (That chance again, babe)
She's Hollywood, she's Hollywood
You know it, baby
Westbound Greyhound to Tinseltown
To pursue her movie star dreams (Again, babe)
She's Hollywood, she's Hollywood
Westbound Greyhound to Tinseltown
To pursue her movie star dreams (Again, babe)
She's Hollywood, she's Hollywood
She's Hollywood, she's Hollywood
Hollywood, she's Hollywood
Hollywood, she's Hollywood
She's Hollywood, she's Hollywood

[Verse 1]
(A hot) Stone shaker is looking fine
She is a heart-breaker every time
She never seems to realize
That someday she will be crying too (Ooh!)
(She is) A sharpshooter that is moving fast
A slight cruiser loaded with gas
Slowing down to make a pass
You think it is going to hit
So why not take a chance?

[Chorus]
Because this is Hot Street (Burning It Up)
Just feel the night beat, yeah (Fun on the run)
'Cause this is Hot Street, yeah (Ready or not)
Because the fantasy will never stop
On Hot Street (Ooh!)

[Verse 2]
(She is) A streetwalker when there is time to spare
She got that big spenders holding their share
A heart of gold, but no one cares (No one seems to care)
Within their eyes
Some young lovers are laughing loud
And there are some old suckers trying to get down
The evening spins around and round (Spins around and round)
Yes, people of the night smoking through the dark

[Chorus]
'Cause this is Hot Street, ooh! (Burning It Up)
Just feel the night beat, yeah (Fun on the run)
Yeah, this is Hot Street, no (Ready or not)
Because the fantasy will never stop
On Hot Street (Ooh!)

[Bridge]
(All night mover) Just trying to put a little fun in their lives
(Winners, losers) You see them standing on the corner in the neon light (Aoww!)
Tonight
(Ooh!)
Yeah, yeah, ooh
(Ooh!)

[Verse 3]
Some feeling you cannot explain
It is such a hard feeling lying in bed's flame
The evening starts to fall again (Starts to fall again)
It is time to come alive
So why not take a chance?

[Chorus]
'Cause this is Hot Street (Burning It Up)
Just feel the night beat, yeah (Fun on the run)
'Cause this is Hot Street, oh (Ready or not)
And the fantasy will never stop
'Cause this is Hot Street (Burning It Up)
Just feel the night beat, yeah (Fun on the run)
'Cause this is Hot Street (Ready or not)
And the fantasy will never stop

[Outro]
Burning it up
Fun on the run
Ready or not
Fantasy will never stop
Burning it up
Fun on the run
Ready or not
Fantasy will never stop
Burning it up
Fun on the run
Ready or not
Fantasy will never stop

[Verse 1]
All alone wishing on stars
Waiting for you to find me
One sweet night I knew I would see
A stranger who'd be my friend

[Chorus]
When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Like it was written in the stars I knew
My friend, my someone in the dark was you

[Verse 2]
Promise me we will always be
Walking the world together
Hand in hand where dreams never end
My star secret friend and me

[Chorus]
When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky
Oh I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye
Wherever you may be
I will look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Wherever you may be
I will look up and see
Someone in the dark for me

[Verse 3]
Though you are gone star far away
Each time I see a rainbow
I will remember being with you
Smiles coming through my tears

[Chorus]
When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky
I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye
Wherever you may be
I will look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Wherever you may be
I will look up and see
Someone in the dark for me

[Verse 1]
She's lookin' for a job and to find a place to stay
She's lookin' for the hope in the empty promisin'
She's workin' two jobs, keepin' alive
She works in a restaurant night and day
She waits her life away
She wipes the tears away

[Pre-Chorus]
She cries inside every time she feels this way
And she's dyin' inside every time her baby cries, no

[Chorus]
Keepin' your head up to the sky
Keepin' your mind on stayin' alive
Give me your wings so we can fly
(Keep your head up, tonight)
Keepin' your head up to the sky
Or we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly

[Verse 2]
We're killin' up the life in the birds and the trees
And we're suckin' up the air in the earth from under me (It's never too late)
I can't even breathe (Just lean)
I can't even see (On me)
Keep your head up, don't give up today
How long can we wait?
I wish that love would come today

[Pre-Chorus]
All you need is love
Tell you I know it's coming soon
And all you need is just a moment, want it to
Keep your head up

[Chorus]
Keepin' your head up to the sky
Keepin' your mind on stayin' alive
Give me your wings so we can fly
Fly away, fly away, fly away (Keep your head up, tonight)
Keepin' your head up to the sky
An' we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly, oh, my

[Bridge]
Everybody say that time is borrowed
And hangin' down your head just ain’t no good
And if you dare to rise above tomorrow
Just give yourself a chance
Fight your circumstance
Rise and do it again

[Chorus]
Keepin' your head up to the sky
Keepin' your mind on stayin' alive
Give me your wings so we can fly (yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Keepin' your head up to the sky (ho-oh-oh)
An' we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly
Keepin' your head up to the sky (I need your love, I need you now)
Keepin' your mind on stayin' alive
(I need your light from here today, I need you now)
Give me your wings so we can fly (yeah-yeah)
Keepin' your head up to the sky (I need your love, I need you now)
An' we can just rise up, tell me now
(I need your light from here today, I need you now)
Give me your wings so we can fly

[Outro]
Keep your head up
Go 'n shine in this blind old world today, today (O-oh-oh)
Keep your head up
Go 'n shine in this blind old world today, today
Keep your head up
The ol' sun's gonna rise on us today, today
Go 'n shine in this blind old world today, today (O-oh-oh)
Keep your head up (I need your love, I need you now)
Go 'n shine in this blind old world today, today (I need your light from here today)
I need you now
Go 'n shine in this blind old world today, today
Ho-oh-oh
Keep your head up

[Verse 1]
Pathological liar
Went to my girlfriend's house and set her dog on fire
Blamed it on her little brother, got him sent to juvi
Fucked her in the bathroom while her dad was watchin' movies
Reach in to my backpack for a fully loaded UZI
Started shootin' up the room he was in
That Chapelle show episode, you know, Paule Mooney was in
Told her everything would be alright
Just don't scream as I dismount
Left the crib, started searchin' for a discount
Exorcist, I need to get some help with this
Once as sweet as Welch's is, think he went insane though
Must have been the drugs in him, he love to sniff the yayo
Insane, could accompany a angel
But maybe one day I can be somebody's angel
Catalog with greatest hits
Sacred does what sacred is
And people raise their brows when you weird as Al Yankovich
I just wanna make out with groupies and play with tits
Snort H and shit, just forget what day it is
I'm eatin' Seder with Clinton and Ralf Nader
Tradin' Acres and bettin' millions against the Lakers
Spittin' out what used to be a children's favorite flavor
Sentenced to hell but I'm out on good behavior
Oh shit, got a new neighbor

[Break: Humming "The Star-Spangled Banner"]

[Verse 2]
Still alive in a room full of melted candles
Lost my job, now I'm in New York sellin' sandals
Saw Christopher Stokes and SW Randall
Introduced my youngest cousin to him, told him he was DTF
They probably had some freaky sex, really, I'm not worried
Already plan to kill myself when the clock hits 7:30
Readin' Hamlet out loud in a room by myself
Givin' different characters different voices, I think it helps
Storyline and flow of the plot
Got a gun in my dresser, it's holdin' a shot

[Intro]
Okay, this is the tempo
And this is the melody:
"I was alone in the dark when I met you..."
Drums

[Beatboxing]
Like that, you know?

[Verse 1]
I was alone in the dark when I met you (Ooh, ooh)
You took my hand and you told me you loved me
(Ooh, ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I was alone, there was no love in my life
(I was alone, there was no love in my life)
I was afraid of life and you came in time
(I was afraid of life and you came in time)
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight
(You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight)
(Ooh, ooh)

[Chorus]
I like the way how you're holding me
(It doesn't matter how you are holding me)
I like the way how you're loving me
(It doesn't matter how you are loving me)
I like the way how you're touching me
(It doesn't matter how you are touching me)
I like the way how you're kissing me
(It doesn't matter how you are kissing me)
You'll see

[Verse 2]
It won't be long 'til we make vows, I bet you (Ooh, ooh)
I thank the Heavens above that I met you (Ooh, ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I was alone, there was no love in my life
(I was alone, there was no love in my life)
I was afraid of life and you came in time
(I was afraid of life and you came in time)
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight
(You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight)
(Ooh, ooh)

[Chorus 2]
I like the way how you're loving me
(It doesn't matter how you are holding me)
I like the way how you're holding me
(It doesn't matter how you are loving me)
I like the way how you're touching me
(It doesn't matter how you are touching me)
I like the way how you're kissing me
(It doesn't matter how you are kissing me)

[Verse 3]
The world's a better place (The world's a better place)
Cause you came in time (Cause you came in time)
You took away the rain and brought the sunshine
(You took away the rain and brought the sunshine)
I was afraid 'cause I was hurt the last time
(I was afraid cause I was hurt the last time)
(Ooh, ooh)

[Chorus]
I like the way how you're holding me
(It doesn't matter how you are holding me)
I like the way how you're loving me
(It doesn't matter how you are loving me)
I like the way how you're touching me
(It doesn't matter how you are touching me)
I like the way how you're kissing me
(It doesn't matter how you are kissing me)
You'll see

[Breakdown]
(Ooh, ooh)

(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)

[Outro]
I like the way how you're holding me
(It doesn't matter how you are holding me)
I like the way how you're loving me
(It doesn't matter how you are loving me)
I like the way how you're touching me
(It doesn't matter how you are touching me)
I like the way how you're kissing me

I like the way how you're kissing me
(It doesn't matter how you are kissing me, you see)
(It doesn't matter how you are holding me)

[Verse 1]
I am your joy, your best of joy
I am the moonlight, you are the spring
Our life's a sacred thing
You know I always will love you, I am forever

[Pre-Chorus]
I am the one who came when you fell down
I was the only one around (The only one)
When things would hurt you, I am forever
Wasn't it I who said that you are free?
When living seemed so hard to be
When things would hurt you

[Chorus]
I am forever (I am forever)
We are forever (We are forever)

[Verse 2]
I am your friend through thick and thin
We need each other, we'll never part
Our love is from the heart
We never say, "I don't need you", we are forever

[Pre-Chorus]
I am the one who said that you are free
When living seemed so hard to be (The only one)
And nothing would cheer you
I am forever
Wasn't it I who carried you around?
When all the walls came tumblin' down
When things would hurt you

[Chorus]
I am forever (I am forever)
We are forever (We are forever)

[Bridge]
You are the sun that lights up the sky
When things are shady, let come what may we do get by

[Pre-Chorus]
I was the only one around (The only one)
When things would hurt you

[Chorus]
We are forever (I am forever, alright)
We are forever (I am forever, uh-huh)
We are forever (ah, what you do? what ya' live for?)
We are forever (What you do? What ya' live for? Our love is strong)
We are forever (What you do? What ya' live for? Uh-huh)
We are forever (Uh-huh, alright)
I am forever, I am forever (Ah, uh-huh, alright)
We are forever (Hoo-hoo), we are forever (Hee)
I am forever, I am forever

[Verse 1: Jason Malachi]
Everybody wanting a piece of Michael Jackson
Reporters stalking the moves of Michael Jackson
Just when you thought he was done
He comes to give it again
They could print it around the world today
He want to write my obituary

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Malachi]
No matter what, you just want to read it again
No matter what, you just want to feel it again

[Chorus: Jason Malachi]
Why is it strange that I would fall in love?
Who is that boogieman you’re thinking of?
Or am I crazy cause I'm just in love
This is breaking news
This is breaking news

[Verse 2: Jason Malachi]
Everybody watching the news of Michael Jackson
They want to see that I fall cause I'm Michael Jackson
You write the words to destroy like it’s a weapon

No matter what, you just want to read it again
No matter what, you just want to feel it again

My life has taken me beyond the planets and the stars
And you're the only one that could take me this far
I'll be forever searching for your love

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Lenny Kravitz]
I walked away but I was wrong
I can't make it another day
You're the one that makes me strong
I can't make it another day
You're the fire that keeps me warm
I can't make it another day
How will I get through this storm?
I can't live another day without your love
(C'mon now!)
(Hee-hee!)

[Outro: Michael Jackson & Lenny Kravitz]
I walked away but I was wrong (It's just too much for me)
I can't make it another day (It's too much for me)
You're the one that makes me strong (It's just too much for me)
I can't make it another day (Hoo-hoo!) (I can't make it, baby)
You're the fire that keeps me warm (I can't make it, baby)
I can't make it another day (It's just too much for me)
How will I get through this storm? (It's just too much for me)
I can't make another day without your love (Hoo-hoo!) (Yeah!)
I walked away but I was wrong
I can't make it another day
You're the one that makes me strong
I can't make it another day

[Verse 1]
All along I had to talk about it
But like a two-edged sword
It cuts you and it stabs me
All along I knew you were a phony girl
You sit behind the mask
And you control your world
You sit around and I watch your face
I try to find the truth
But that's your hiding place
You say you love me, but it's hard to see
Cause' when he's in your arms
You're throwing rocks at me!

[Chorus 1]
Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don't know
Who do you love?
I don't want you
If you can't answer
You know me

[Chorus 2]
(There is nothing in your eyes)
There is nothing in your eyes
(But that's the way you cry)
But that's the way you cry, girl (Cry, girl)
(All is grand, all is bright)
All is grand, all is bright
(You're just studying my mind)

[Verse 2]
I walk around, I’m suffering in my doom
When I come to you
You're sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place
So take off the mask, so I can see your face!

[Chorus 1]
Who do you love?
Is it me?
With You?
I don't know
Who do you love, babe?
I don't want you
If you can't answer
I know you

[Chorus 3]
(Heaven must be wary)
Heaven must be wary
(Your smile is scary)
You got me scared, girl
(Insincere, empty tears)
Every year, yours are good
(Where's your soul? Where'd it go?)
You got me scared, girl

(Heaven must be wary)
Heaven must be wary
(Your smile is scary)
You know where you've been
(Insincere, empty tears)
Every year, na na na
(Where's your soul? Where did it go?)

Is it me
Is it you
Behind this mask, I ask

[Verse 3]
I walk around I’m suffering in my doom
And when I come to you
You're sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place
So take off the mask
So I can see your face!

[Chorus 1]
Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don’t know
Who do you love, babe?
I don't want you
If you can't answer
I know you!

[Chorus 1]
Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don't know
Who do you love?
I don't want you
If you can't answer
I don't know

[Outro]
Is it me
Is it you
Behind this mask, I ask
Is it me
Is it you
Behind this mask, I ask
Is it me
Is it you
Behind this mask, I ask
I don't want to talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I don't want to talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I don't want to talk about it (Let's talk about it)

[Verse 1]
She was there just sitting at the table
Thinking now that things won't be the same
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
And she answered "No" to me but
I guess I learned my lesson much too soon

[Verse 2]
I never thought she'd leave me here forever
But who knows just what the future brings
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
And she answered "No" to me but
I guess I learned my lesson much too soon

[Bridge]
Take away this never ending sorrow
Take this lonely feeling from my soul
If only I knew what things bring tomorrow
She'd be sitting here beside me
And my heart would then be whole

[Verse 3]
I hope to make a change now for the better
Never letting fate control my soul
And I'm hoping that my prayers will see
The day that she'll come back to me
But I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
Ooh, ooh
Yes, I guess I learned my lesson much too soon

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Guess with a few exceptions, yeah, I'm living honest
Except I promised my momma that I would finish college
Started chasing profit
Sorry ma, I ain't forget about it but if money evil
I'm hoping that you could see through all the drama
And watch me get these dollars
And my ambition burn so hot, it's like I'm bleeding lava
Haters be pleading me to stop but I don't even bother
Though my approach is seeming awkward, I could see it proper
See success and I just see the fact that I don't need a father
Doms hotter than the drop of Harry Potter shit
Pedal to the metal, high-level, full-throttle shit
Still searching for reasons why niggas ain't acknowledge this
I'm lost in an era where real shit does not exist
I need the sway of things, I'm everyday cooling it
I'm getting blazed, laughing at the way they overdoing shit
I'm just a old soul sticking to a newer script
I guess I got to prove this shit, I'm truly too legit to quit

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
I'd like to send a shout to the fathers that didn't raise us
To every old hater, now unable to say much
To critics doing dirty with comments, a nigga paid for an apartment
Yesterday off some songs I haven't yet made up
Black Cressida, pay up
Bars going hard as the ashtray where I place guts
Shouts to the eses who paid pesos to play us
Riding in the barrio
Huff and puff blowing kush in Huf clothing articles
Kenny rolling blunts got us stuck like a barnacle
To the bottom of your shit, ironic cause the audio
As nautical as ships, look momma, look momma
Look, your product is legit, I promise, honest
This karma got me balling up my fist
'Til I demolish your clique, pardon the clips
I am honestly as bomb as it gets
Regardless of who is talking, I'm farming, harvesting hits
Just me and Domo and lit marijuana to split between two of us
Rocking boxes easy as warming some ramen noodles up
So, searching for a way to state it right
Young, black, and jaded, vision hazy strolling through the night

[Intro]
(Hoo!)
(Hee!)

[Verse 1]
All alone, she's in the ego zone
The word is out that you're doin' wrong
On the move, got fire in your shoes
By word of mouth you are on the loose
You're livin' on sunset time (You're livin' on sunset time)
(Hoo!)

Feelin' bad you're livin' much too fast
The truth, the truth that you're on the pass
In the raw, they don't know what you saw
From word of mouth you're breakin' every law

[Chorus]
Sunset Driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Morning rider, you're a Saturday nighter (Aaow!)

[Verse 2]
On the go, got fever in your soul
You better not shout where you gonna go
Livin' hot, doin' what you should not
The break's on me then what do you get
We're livin' on sunset time (We're livin' on sunset time)
(Want that dime)

Shoot the breeze, you feel that she's the tease
Your night is free what you want to be
Who's to trust when livin' dangerous?
Tonight's your night, but this is what you lose

[Chorus]
Sunset Driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Gettin' higher, you're a Saturday nighter (Aaow!)
(Hoo!)
(Pah-dah-da-da-dah-dah-dah)
(Hee!)

[Bridge]
You are there when the night's in town
Standin' there with the top of the round
They don't care about the things you used to say
You're like the cinema, you think there's nothin' wrong (Hoo!)

[Verse 3]
Goin' town, you do it every time
The word's got out that you're on the line
On the moon, got fever in your shoes
The night's on you, what are you gonna do?

[Chorus]
Sunset Driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Got to reach that driver, you're a Saturday nighter (Aaow!)

[Outro]
(Pah-dah-da-da-dah-dah-dah) (Hee-hee-hee)
(Aah) (Pah-dah-da-da-dah-dah-dah)
(Hoo!)
(Hee!)
(Hoo!) (Hee!)
(Hoo!)

(Hee!)
(Hoo!)
(Hee!)

(That’s it, Janet.)
(That’s fine, Michael.)

[Verse 1]
I was alone in the dark when I met you
Ooh
You took my hand and you told me you loved me
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was alone, there was no love in my life
I was afraid of life and you came in time
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight
Ooh

[Chorus]
I like the way how you are holding me
It does not matter how you are holding me
I like the way how you are loving me
It does not matter how you are loving me
I like the way how you are touching me
It does not matter how you are touching me
I like the way how you are kissing me
It does not matter how you are kissing me
You will see

[Verse 2]
It would not be long till we make vows, I bet you
Ooh
I thank the Heavens above that I met you
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was alone, there was no love in my life
I was afraid of life and you came in time
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight
Ooh

[Chorus]
I like the way how you are holding me
It does not matter how you are holding me
I like the way how you are loving me
It does not matter how you are loving me
I like the way how you are touching me
It does not matter how you are touching me
I like the way how you are kissing me
It does not matter how you are kissing me
You will see

[Verse 3]
The world is a better place because you came in time
You took away the rain and brought the sunshine
I was afraid because I was hurt the last time
Ooh

[Chorus]
I like the way how you are holding me
It does not matter how you are holding me
I like the way how you are loving me
It does not matter how you are loving me
I like the way how you are touching me
It does not matter how you are touching me
I like the way how you are kissing me
It does not matter how you are kissing me
You will see

[Outro]
Ooh

[Verse 1]
We're on a mission in the everlastin' light that shines
A revelation of the truth in chapters of our minds

[Pre-Chorus]
(So long, bad times)
We're gonna shake it up and break it up
We're sharin' a light brighter than the sun
(Hello, good times)
We're here to simulate, eliminate
And congregate, illuminate

[Chorus]
(We are here to change the world) Hee!
Gonna change the world, hee!
(We are here to change the world)
Gonna change the world, ooh!

[Verse 2]
So do surrender 'cause the power is deep inside my soul
Ah, sing it

[Chorus]
(We are here to change the world) Hee!
Gonna change the world, baby
(We are here to change the world) Hee!
Gonna change the world, ooh!

Ooh! (We are here to change the world)
We're gonna change the world, girl
(We are here to change the world)
My brothers, my brother, baby
We're gonna change the world
(We are here to change the world) Hee!
Deep down in my body
Deep down in my soul, baby
(We are here to change the world) Hee!
Gonna change the world
Ooh!

Are you the girl, meant to me

Let me love you for a little while

[Verse 3]
Now she started finger-popping to the beat
So I said let’s get right on the floor
She said to keep your mind on dancing
Won't be no romancing
No, no, don't mess around with me
I ain't playing

[Chorus]
Don’t be messing around, don’t be messing around (with me)
Don’t be messing around  (With me) hey hey hey
So don’t be messing around, don’t be messing around (with me)
Don’t be messing around (With me) hey hey

[Verse 1]
There we are as cold as ice
Asking me to love you
And often be your friend
There you are, I walk alone
Telling me to love you
And often be your end

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She told me she was givin' me
A life-time love forever true
But she left me for another man
And I’m singin' to keep from feelin' blue

[Chorus]
All I know is
Tschada dada dada naa (Oh lord)
Tschada dada dada naa 

[x2]
Come on set me free
(Set me free)

[Verse 2]
There I am so all alone
And I'm so sad and lonely
Tell me what will I do
I can’t reveal, I’m holdin' on
I want you still to love me
I feel I am your fool

[Pre-Chorus 2]
They told me you should sing a song
Of happy when your feelin' blue
I b'n singin' for so very long
Still cryin', tell me what should I do

[Chorus]
All I know is
Tschada dada dada naa (Oh lord)
Tschada dada dada naa 

[x2]
Come on set me free
(Set me free)

[Harmonica Solo]

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She told me she'd be givin' me
A life-time love so guarantee (guarantee)
But she left me for another man
And I’m singin', cryin' helplessly
But I’ll keep singin'

[Chorus]
Tschada dada dada naa (Oh lord)
Tschada dada dada naa (Oh my my)
Tschada dada dada naa
Come on set me free
(Set me free)
(Woh-oh-oh)

Tschada dada dada naa (Oh no) (And I keep crying)
Tschada dada dada naa ('Cos I wanna be free)
Tschada dada dada naa (Hold on, hold on)
Come on set me free

Tschada dada dada naa (Woh I, Oh)

Come on set me free
(Set me free)
(Wo-oh-oh-oh) (Wo-oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 1]
Love was taken from a young life
And no one told her why
Her direction has a dim light
From one more violent crime

[Interlude]
She innocently questioned why
Why her father had to die
She asked the men in blue
How is it that you get to choose
Who will live and who will die
Did God say that you could decide?
You saw he did not run
And that my daddy had no gun

[Verse 2]
In the middle of a village
Way in a distant land
Lies a poor boy with his broken toy
Too young to understand
He's awaken, ground is shaking
His father grabs his hand
Screaming, crying, his wife's dying
Now he's left to explain

[Pre-Chorus]
He innocently questioned why
Why his mother had to die
What did these soldiers come here for?
If they're for peace, why is there war?
Did God say that they could decide
Who will live and who will die?
All my mama ever did
Was try to take care of her kids

We're innocently standing by
Watching people lose their lives
It seems as if we have no voice
It's time for us to make a choice
Only God could decide
Who will live and who will die
There's nothing that cannot be done
If we raise our voice as one

[Chorus]
They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough
They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough
They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from you, baby
We can't take it
We've already had enough

(Deep in my soul baby)
Deep in your soul and let God decide
(Deep in my soul)
It's up to me and I am still alive
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough

It's going down baby
(Just let God decide)
It's going on baby
(Just let God decide)
Deep in my soul baby

We've already had enough

They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't, we can't
We've already had enough
You're my lover
We've already had enough

They've gotta hear it from me, in the dark from me
As my brother, it's too much from me
As my brother, baby
As my lover
We've already had enough (Aaow!)

[Outro]
Oh lord, oh lord
Deep in my soul, babe
Oh no
Why did you do it?
Why did you do it?
Please don't let it
Oh no, oh no
Why did you do it?
Oh, don't do it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Please don't do it
Why did you do it?
Oh no, hold on
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I took my baby on a riverboat cruise
And she was well aware
I was excited 'bout the way that things could've been
She said that I don't care
I wore a face no one could recognize, in disguise
Someone called out my name
They thought of takin' pictures, autographs, then they grabbed
My joy had turned to pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reachin' for fortune and fame
I feel the pressure settin' in, I'm livin' just to win
I'm done in my pain, don't be feelin' your pain

[Chorus]
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't be feelin' your pain
It's the price of fame, it's the price of fame
So don't you ever complain

[Verse 2]
I am a cover of a magazine, what a scene
They know my every move
"Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine"
That always bothers me
Get in your car, you want to take a ride, look behind
Someone is followin' you
You try to get away, you turn 'round fast, but too bad
They know your every move

[Pre-Chorus]
Father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reachin' for fortune and fame
And I feel the pressure settin' in, I'm livin' just to win
I'm feelin' all this pain, don't you ever complain

[Chorus]
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame, you pay the price for fame
So don't be feelin' no pain
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
Father never lies (The price of fame)
My father never lies
My father never lies (The price of fame)
So don't be feelin' this way, boy

[Instrumental Break]
Hee-hee
Aow!
Do it, ooh!

[Verse 3]
I like to take some time and get away, then they say
Is that boy still alive?
The weak that really start takin' pills, what a thrill
Only the strong survive

[Pre-Chorus]
Father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
They start to wonderin' where have you been?
I feel the envious look at me
Their mistaken jealousy
Well then stand here in my shoes
And get a taste of my blues

[Chorus]
It’s the price of fame
You pay the price for fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame
You pay the price for fame
So don't be feelin' this way
It's the price of fame
You pay the price for fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame
My father never lies (The price of fame)
My father never lies, baby
My father never lies (The price of fame)
So don't be feelin' no pain, boy

[Verse 1]
'Cause this time of ours is borrowed
We must give a helping hand
Whatever happen to our heroes
They must get another chance
(We can do it again)

[Pre-Chorus]
We drove closer, closer and closer
And even though we are almost there

[Chorus]
You are all I need in my life
You are all I dream here at night
Close your eyes, imagine I am taking you away

[Post-Chorus]
Tonight

[Verse 2]
Come together all the people (We can do it now)
Here is your chance to make it right (Go, take a chance)

[Pre-Chorus]
And even though we are getting close
We are not there just yet
And even though we are almost there

[Chorus]
You are all I need in my life
You are all I dream here at night
Close your eyes, imagine I am taking you away
Then one more time close your eyes
I am always here to stay

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, my)
Tonight

[Outro]
(I'm always here)
(Oh, my)
(I'm always here)
We can do it again
(I'm always here)

[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
Now I got a mission
The story unfolds
What the wise men have told you, is already known
That a woman and a man
Should go by the plan
And we find out, how high we can fly

There's just one religion
One family of love
We suffer the children
As God cries above
And the giving, not the taking
With hearts open wide
And it looks like we fall
And it burns like a flame
Any ground that I claim

[Pre-Chorus]
So what is my life
If I don't believe
There is someone to watch me
Follow my dreams
Take all my chances, like those who dare?
And what of our world
What does it become
When the damage is done?
And you held out, you said no, you stand up

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Only God knows
That it’s all in the game
It’s all in Your Name
Carry me to the Gates of Paradise
They're the same
It's all in Your Name

[Verse 2: Barry Gibb]
Look to Heaven
An Angel appears
To love and protect us
Through all of our tears
And the gateway to peace
It stands open wide
And it looks like we fall
And it burns like a flame
Any ground that I claim

[Pre-Chorus]
So what is my life
If I don't believe
There is someone to watch me
Follow my dreams
Take all my chances, like those who dare?
And where is the peace
We're searching for
Under the shadows of war?
Can we hold out, and stand up, and say no?

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Only God knows
That it's all in the game (Oh)
It's all in Your Name (Oh yeah)
Follow me to the Gates of Paradise
They're the same
It's all in Your Name

[Bridge: Barry Gibb & Michael Jackson]
Say the word and I'll be there
To love you, and understand you
Meet the line on, and understand 

[?]
Will they all know 

[?] (It's over)
Then we'll all know 

[?] (It's over)
See? that it's done 

[?] (And it's all in Your Name)

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
It's all in the game
It's all in Your Name
Follow me through the Gates of Paradise
They're the same (yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)

It's all in the game
It's all in Your Name
Follow me through the Gates of Paradise
They're the same
They're the same (yeah-yeah)

[Outro: Michael Jackson]
It's all in the game
It's all in the game
Follow me through the Gates of Paradise
They're the same
It's all in Your Name

[Verse]
Why did you let him get away?
After the staring, what did you say?
Shot me down as cold as ice
Screamed in my face then pulled you back
She should have spied down his skin
Now it's my job to get revenge
Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get away?

[Pre-Chorus]
Too bad, forget it
'Cause it's Al Capone who's in it
So sad, regret it
'Cause a madman's out tonight

[Chorus]
You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No-one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way
You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No-one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way

[Verse]
Why did you let him get away?
After the staring, what did you say?
Shot me down as cold as ice
Screamed in my face then pulled you back
She should have spied down his skin
Now it's my job to get revenge
Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get away?

[Pre-Chorus]
Too bad, forget it
'Cause it's Al Capone who's in it
So sad, regret it
And I told her, out tonight

[Chorus]
You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No-one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way
You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No-one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way

[Insturmental Break]
Aaow!
Aaow!

[Pre-Chorus]
Too bad, forget it
'Cause it's Al Capone who's in it
So sad, regret it
'Cause a man is out tonight

[Chorus]
You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No-one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No-one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way

[Chorus]
You should have told her (Should have told her)
Nobody ever showed her about us (Oh, ba-da)
No-one's sleepin' (No-one's lovin')
Nobody should be grievin' this way (Oh-ba-ba)

You should have told her (Should have told her)
Nobody ever showed her about us (Oh, ba-da)
No-one's sleepin' (No-one's love)
Nobody should be grievin' this way (Aaow!)

[Outro]
Why did you let him get away?
After the staring, what did you say?
Shot me down as cold as ice
Screamed in my face then pulled you back
She should have spied down his skin
Now it's my job to get revenge
Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get away? (Aaow!)
Doo-doo-do-do-doo
Hee-hee-hee-hee! (Hoo!)

[Verse 1]
We can walk away
But I turn my head to see if you would stay, baby
We can love the day
Then I am hoping that we throw those stones away
Baby, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, don't you leave me standing here
Why you leave me waiting here?
Now you got me here in tears
Hold me

[Chorus]
Hold me tonight
Spread your love tonight (Yeah!)
It's gonna be all right
Everything will be just fine
If you're loving me tonight (Tell me it'll be all right)
It's gonna be all right (Say it's gonna be just fine)
Everything is just fine
Everything will be just fine

[Post-Chorus]
All right

[Verse 2]
She wrote me a letter, it's burning in my heart
She is setting me free (She in the dark)
Whispers in the dark (Save me from these thoughts)
Unbreak my heart
You let it fall apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Please stay this way
Don't you run away
I got a premonition (I used to dream)
Ooh girl, it burns just like the sun

[Chorus]
Hold me tonight
Spread your love tonight (Yeah!)
It's gonna be all right
Everything will be just fine
If you're loving me tonight (Tell me it'll be all right)
It's gonna be all right (Say it's gonna be just fine)
Everything is just fine
Everything will be

[Bridge]
Wake me up when all this is new like morning (Like morning)
Girl, your smile always makes me cry
(If you think you are going to)
Just hold me, kiss me, touch me
(Stay with me tonight)

[Outro]
All right, it's all right
All right, it's all right
It's all right, all right with me
It's all right, all right
It's all right, all right with me
It's all right, all right
It's all right, all

All right
It's all right
All right
It's all right

[Intro]
Ha!
Gone!
Doggone
Aouw!

[Verse 1]
She drink to your mind
She drink to your fate
You walkin' the line
She makin' you stay
She keepin' the count
She making' you pay
She ready again
Get ready again

[Pre-Chorus]
She wants you, boy (Don't stop, I bet you gon' stop, don't stop, I bet you gon' stop)
She needs you, boy (Don't stop, I bet you gon' stop, don't stop, I bet you gon' stop)
She haunts you, boy (Don't stop, I bet you gon' stop, don't stop, I bet you gon' stop)
Don't you see, she got me thinking

[Chorus]
Black widow woman (You're dirty, baby)
In a web of seduction (Stop lying, baby)
She's a lucky filled woman
She's something to see (You're dirty, you're walkin')
She is the one, the one for me (You ain't no friend of mine)

[Verse 2]
She fed you a line
You bought it this time
Connecting the dots
Wish you would've declined
The look in your eyes
You're telling me so
The truth is unlearned
The truth is untold

[Pre-Chorus]
She wants you, boy (Don't stop, I bet you gon' stop, don't stop, I bet you gon' stop) (Doggone)
She needs you, boy (Don't stop, I bet you gon' stop, don't stop, I bet you gon' stop) (Yeah)
She haunts you, boy (Don't stop, I bet you gon' stop, don't stop, I bet you gon' stop)
You, you, you got to, baby

[Chorus]
Black widow woman (You're dirty, baby)
In a web of seduction (Stop lying, baby)
She's a lucky filled woman
She's something to see (You're dirty, you're dirty, you're dirty)
She's the one, the one for me
Black widow, baby
And with your love, I feel at home

Aouw!
Gone!
Hoo-hoo!
Hoo-hoo!
Hoo!
You ain't no friend of mine
Hoo!

You're dirty
You're walkin'
You're, you're nasty
You're nasty, I love you, girl

[Chorus]
Black widow woman (You're dirty, you're dirty baby)
In a web of seduction (You're nasty, baby)
She's a lucky filled woman (Black widow, ooh, black widow)
She's something to see (Black widow, black widow)
She's the one, the one for me (Hoo!)
Black widow woman (Black widow, baby)
In a web of seduction (Black widow, baby)
She's a lucky filled woman
She's something to see
She's the one, the one for me (Ain't no friend of mine)
Black widow woman
In a web of seduction (Yeah, you're dirty)
She's a lucky filled woman (You're dirty)
She's something to see
She's the one, the one for me
Gone!

[Verse 1]
You're the one that I adore, you
Give me one and don’t adore me
Tell me things you all believe I do
All the things I wanna say and
Tell the things you are to me and
All the lies you have to say I do
Ooh, ooh, ooh, baby
Yesterday was when I felt down
And you came with my stuff and put my fate on the ground
And you have to say that you looked at me
Well, obviously, I do
That's why I want to be

[Chorus]
Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I mean mine

[Verse 2]
You're the one that I adore
Just kiss me once, I wanna know you
Feel the vibe that I can feel in mine
If you are the one for me
Just tell me twice and I will see
The heart and soul of all the things I feel
Ooh, ooh, ooh-noh
Yesterday was when I felt down
I start tryin' to make you think I was around
You know, life was just a thing, she don't past the way I do
Because I want to be

[Chorus]
Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I want to be
Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I mean mine
Babe, alright
Ahh, ahh
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
Yesterday was when I felt down
I start, try to make sense like I was around
And was tryin' to make the way to see, what a thing I do
You know 'cause I want to be

[Chorus]
Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I want to be
Free, free like the wind blows
(Free like the wind blows)
To fly away just like a sparrow
(Wherever I go)
The feel of letting my hair blow
(An' I'll take my time, baby)
To take my time wherever I go
I want to be
Free, free like the wind blows
(Free like the wind)
To fly away just like a sparrow (Ooh, my, my, mine)
The feel of letting my hair blow
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, baby)
To take my time wherever I go
(Wherever I go)
Free, free like the wind blows
(You'll be free, now)
(I want to be free)
To fly away just like a sparrow
(I just want to be free)
The feel of letting my hair blow
(I want to be free) (Ah, ah, uh, oh baby)
To take my time wherever I go
(Wherever I go - ooh!)
I've got to be free, free, free, free

[laughs]

[Ronnie you are so silly!]

[Verse 1]
Read you from a mile away
Just thinking easy to adore
A taste of me
Let the fountain pour
Girl, I'm in a state of sin
Ooh I want to taste your skin
Ooh I want to, girl I got to wonder
If we can drown again

If you can touch me again
Say we will dance
Light fire to my skin
We burn again

[Chorus]
Girl I want to touch the fire
Oh come on and let me light the fire
And you can make me burn tonight
Baby come on and let me light the fire
You can let me touch the fire
Girl, come on and let me light the fire
And you can make me burn tonight
Baby come on and let me burn tonight

[Verse 2]
I cannot believe I see you ahead right now
Feel the fire
We are burning like Hell came tonight
My soul deciders

I cannot nobody stop the thing we got
It makes you wonder
A friend of mine? Sexy wine?
Baby why you play me like a toy?

When you say, take me again
When that we dance
We passionately stop to burn again

[Chorus]
Girl I want to touch the fire
Oh come on and let me light the fire
And you can make me burn tonight
Baby come on and let me light the fire
Burn Tonight!

[Chorus]
Girl I want to touch the fire
Oh come on and let me light the fire
And you can make me burn tonight
Baby come on and let me light the fire
Girl I want to touch the fire
Oh come on and let me light the fire
And you can make me burn tonight
Baby come on and let me light the fire
Girl I want to touch the fire
Oh come on and let me light the fire
And you can make me burn tonight
Baby come on and let me light the fire

[Intro]
Ho!

Aaow!

[Chorus]
I'm heading for the border
It's on my mind
And nothing really matter
I've got to be on time
And nothing going to stop
Aren’t no stop and go
I'm speeding on the midway
I got to really burn this road

Because

(Speed demon)
Speeding on the freeway, got to get a lead way
(Speed demon)
Doing it on the highway, got to have it my way
(Speed demon)
Mind is like a compass, I'm stopping at nothing
Just pull over boy and get your ticket right
Aaow!

Just pull over boy and get your ticket right

(Speed demon)

(Speed demon)

Go!
Aaow!

Ho!

Just pull over boy and get your ticket right

[Chorus]
I'm heading for the border
It's on my mind
And nothing really matter
I've got to be on time

[Intro]
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

If you look around
The whole world is coming together now, baby
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Feel it in the air
The wind is taking it everywhere, yeah
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

[Verse 1]
All the colors of the world should be
Loving each other wholeheartedly
Yes, it is all right
Take my message to your brother
And tell him twice
Spread the word and try to teach the man
Who is hating his brother
When hate would not do, ooh
Because we are all the same, yes
The blood inside of me is inside of you

[Chorus]
Now, tell me
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Yeah, yeah, oh

[Verse 2]
Every breath you take
Is someone's death in another place
(Another place, another place, another place)
Every healthy smile
Is hunger and strife to another child
(Another child, another child)

But the stars do shine
In promising salvation, is near this time
(Near this time)
Can you feel it now?
So brothers and sisters show me know how

[Chorus]
Now, tell me
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Yeah, yeah, oh

[Verse 3]
All the children in the world should be
Loving each other wholeheartedly
Yes, it is all right
Take my message to your brother
And tell him twice

Take the news to the marching men
Who are killing their brothers
When death would not do, ooh
Yes, we are all the same
Yes, the blood inside of me is inside of you

[Chorus]
Now, tell me
Can you feel it?
(Tell me, can you feel it?)
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you say what’s going down?
Can you feel it?
(With feeling in your bones)
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
(Heee)

[Intro]
Hee, hee
Hee, hee, hee
Hee, hee, hee
Hee, hee, oh

[Verse 1]
Father comes home from work
And he's scared to death
Mother cries for the kid, and the note she read
Father runs to the table, he said, "What's goin' on?"
Mother cries desperately, "Our little baby's gone"

[Chorus]
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

[Verse 2]
She wrote that she is tired of step dad using her
Sayin' that he'll buy her things, while sexually abusing her
Just think that she's all alone, somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive?
She ain't got nothin' to eat

[Chorus]
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock, yeah
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are, oh

[Bridge]
Save me (From this living hell)
Save me ('Cause I, I wanna help)
Save me (I'm tired, I'm mad)
Save me ('Cause this, it ain't no joke)
Save me ('Cause I'm out for blood)
Save me ('Cause I don't wanna ignore)
Save me (It's time I replied)
Save me ('Cause I, I wanna defeat)
Save me

[Post-Chorus]
Hee, hee
Hoo, hoo

[Verse 3]
Now she's on the move, she's off to Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, the man is waitin' there
"I'll show you where the money is, girl, just let down your hair"
He's taking her on the streets of Sunset Boulevard
She's selling her body hot, girl, that will take you far
The police come 'round the corner, somebody there, they told
He's arresting this little girl
Who's only twelve years old

[Chorus]
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Do you know where your children are? (Because it's now twelve o'clock)
Do you know where's your baby? (If they're somewhere out on the street)
Where's your baby?
Where's your baby? (Just imagine how scared they are)

[Post-Chorus]
Hee, hee (Do you know where your children are?)
Hee, hee, hee (Because it's now twelve o'clock)

Hee, hee, hee, oh

[Chorus]
Do you know where your children are? (Where your children are)
Because it's now twelve o'clock  (Where your children are)
If they're somewhere out on the street (Where's your baby?)
Just imagine how scared they are (It's your baby, little girl)
Hee, hee, oh
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are (Yeah)

[Outro]
Hee, hee, hee
She's your baby
Know where your children are?
Do you know where your children
She's just baby
She's just baby
She's just baby
She's just baby
Hee, hee, oh

[Verse 1]
Welcome to Hollywood
That's what they told you
A child star in Hollywood
That's what they sold you
Grace with beauty, charm and talent
You would do, what you were told
But they robbed you, of your childhood
Took your youth, and sold it for gold

[Chorus]
Elizabeth, I love you
You're every star that shines in the world to me
Elizabeth, can't you see that it's true?
Elizabeth, I love you
You're more than just a star to me

[Verse 2]
Lovely Elizabeth
You have surpassed them all
My friend Elizabeth
Learned to outlast them all
Many started, back when you did
Lost their way, and now they are gone
But look at you, a true survivor
Full of life, and carrying on

[Chorus]
Elizabeth, I love you
You're every star, that shines in the world to me
Elizabeth, can't you see that it's true?
Elizabeth, I love you
You're more than just a star

[Bridge]
This is your life
You seem to have it all
You reached your peak
They wanted you to fall
It's very sad, this world can be so bad
But through all the heartaches
When they put you down
You know, you were the victor
And you earned the crown
It's like, walking through the fire
Determined to win
You were, beating life's battles
Again and again

[Chorus]
Elizabeth, I love you
You're every star that shines in the world to me
Elizabeth, can't you see that it's true?

[Verse 4]
Remember the time, I was all alone
You stood by my side and said
"Let's be strong"
You did all these things
That only a true friend can do

[Outro]
Elizabeth, I love you
The world knows your worth now
Of all the things on earth now
I pray one day I'll be just......like you!

[Verse 1]
Tear me apart, break my heart
Let me in this wonderland with you
Your desire warms my heart
I loved you from the moment, yes I

[Pre-Chorus]
She said she want to fall in love
She said she want to give it up, oh
She said she want to turn my life all around
She said she want to play the game
I love you when you say my name
I love it when you say you want me around

[Chorus]
I want to fall, want to fall in love with you
Oh, just let me fall, let me fall in love with you
(Just let me fall with you)
Girl, just let me fall, let me fall in love with you
(Just let me fall with you)
Please, just let me fall, let me fall in love with you

[Verse 2]
Now I am here with you
The sun comes through
The moon is watching us, me and you
The sun is going down (The rain comes down)
The rain is coming down
And the wind is blowing us and it's ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
She said she want to fall in love (She said)
She said she want to give it up
She said she want to turn my life all around

[Chorus]
I want to fall, want to fall in love with you (Say you wanna fall)
Oh, just let me fall, let me fall in love with you
(Say you are in love with me)
Girl, just let me fall, let me fall in love with you (Oh, just let me fall)
(Loving you, loving you, loving you)
Please, just let me fall, let me fall in love with you (I'm loving you)

[Bridge]
Stay with me, you are making me say
Stay with me, I'm making my way
Inside the room, inside the room, my love
Don't walk away, let's run away
And play a game
I am always with you now

[Chorus]
Ooh, girl, I want to fall (Taking me there)
In love with you (You're making me there, ooh, nanana)
Oh, I want to fall in love, fall in love with you
(You're beautiful, you're wonderful, I love you so)
Ooh, I want to fall, let me fall in love with you (You're beautiful)
Ooh, I want to fall, let me fall in love with you
(I love you so, I love you so)
Ooh, I want to fall, let me fall in love with you (Say it again)
Ooh, I want to fall, let me fall in love with you (Ooh, ooh)
Ooh, I want to fall, let me fall in love with you
Ooh, I want to fall, let me fall in love with you

[Verse 1]
Sun comes up on this new morning
Shifting shadows, a songbird sings
And if these words could keep you happy
I'd do anything
And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder
With a tender touch you know so well
Somebody once said it's the soul that matters
Baby, who can really tell when two hearts belong so well

[Chorus]
And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

[Verse 2]
Moon shines down on this good evening
One warm kiss in the cold night air
For this good love I'm receiving
I'd go anywhere, just as long as you were there

[Chorus]
And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
When I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

[Bridge]
Oh, and on these quiet days
Where souls embrace so silently
Oh, the rain may wash away
All these words that young lovers say

[Chorus]
And maybe the walls will crumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I need you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

[Outro]
Say that you'll never go, that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
(That's for all time)
(That's for all time)
Say that you'll never go, that's for all time
Baby, you'll never go, that's for all time

[Intro]
Oooooh
Hee-hee!
Hoo-hoo!
Hee!
Hoo-hoo!
Hee!
Oooooh!
Oh
Chika, chika

[Verse 1]
You know I can't get away from you, girl
(You've got me shakin')
I need all of the things you do, girl
(My body's aching)
Come on, baby, get up and rock it to the rhythm
Put out your heart to me
And, lady, let me set you free

[Chorus]
Our love will shine at the dawn of a brand-new feeling
Just take your time and you'll see that the magic's on its way
Girl, if we try, we can set all our senses reeling
That's the day
You know I got the hots tonight
Night, girl, girl
Hee!
Hoo!

[Verse 2]
I got a heart beating just for you, girl
(You've got me shakin')
I've tried all but I can't get you, girl
(My body's aching)
Come on, baby, get up and rock it to the rhythm
(Rock it, baby!)
Put out your heart to me
And, lady, let me set you free (Let me set you free, girl)

[Chorus]
Our love will shine at the dawn of a brand-new feeling
Just take your time and you'll see that the magic's on its way
Girl, if we try, we can set all our senses reeling
That's the day
You know I got the hots tonight
Tonight, girl, girl

[Bridge]
Baby, the love that is waiting inside your temper (Hoo-hee!, hee-hee!)
Show me the passion I feel when I'm by your side (Oh, girl)
This is the time to discover the dream we're living (Hee!)
Girl, can't you feel it?
Time of your life (Aow!)
(Ooh)
(Chika, chika)
(Hee)

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
(Don't you know?)
Our love will shine at the dawn of a brand-new feeling
Just take your time and you'll see that the magic's on its way (The magic's on its way)
Girl, if we try, we can set all our senses reeling (Take your time)
That's the day
You know I got the hots tonight
Our love will shine at the dawn of a brand-new feeling (Girl, girl)
(Girl, yeah)
Just take your time and you'll see that the magic's on its way (Take your time, take your time, girl)
Girl, if we try, we can set all our senses reeling (We can try, we can try)
That's the day
You know I got the hots tonight
Our love will shine at the dawn of a brand-new feeling (No other, no other)
Just take your time and you'll see that the magic's on its way (Take your time, take your time)
Girl, if we try, we can set all our senses reeling (Time)
That's the day
You know I got the hots tonight

[Verse 1]
Lookin' over my photographs
I saw a picture of you an' me
Lovin' made deep
I had to write you just to tell you that
And to find out, if you really now missin' me, 'cause

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
If you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
If you don't need me
Just like I need you
If you don't love me
If you don't love me

[Chorus]
And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
What will I do girl?
'Cause I'm in love with you

[Verse 2]
I told the doctor that I'm broken-hearted
And my temperature has risen to a hundred and three
Why don't you write me back and save me girl?
Tell me what I wanna hear, like you're missin' me, but

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
If you don't need me
(If you don't need me)
If you don't want me
The way I want you
If you don't love me
If you don't love me

[Chorus]
And if you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
And if you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
And if you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
'Cause I'm in love with you
You!

[Bridge]
Oh pretty baby, I've been missing you
From such a long, long time ago
You changed your number and I couldn't call you
So I couldn't tell you so
I had to write you just to tell you that
I'm even kissin' on your photograph

[Outro]
If you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
And if you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
And if you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
Oooh-ooh
Baby baby baby!
If you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
And if you don't want me
(If you don't love me)
Give it to me
(If you don't love me)
Oooh-ooh

Baby baby baby
If you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
And if you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
And I don't love you
(If you don't love me)
If you don't need me
(If you don't love me)
Give it to me
Give it!
If you don't want me
Baby tell me baby
If you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
If you don't want me
Love me
(If you don't love me)
I really wanna have it
(If you don't love me)
I'm beggin' like mad!
I dunno what I'm gonna do
All I know is
Baby baby baby baby!

If you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
If you don't love me
(If you don't want me)
And if you don't want me
(If you don't love me)
And if you don't need me
(If you don't love me)
I am beggin' like mad!
(If you don't love me)
I am beggin' like mad!
(If you don't love me)
Give it to me baby!
(If you don't want me)
And if you don't want me

If you don't need me
(If you don't love me)
Give it to me baby!

If you don't want me
(If you don't love me)
And if you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
Aow!
If you don't love me
(If you don't love me)

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

[Chorus: Michael Jackson,  will.i.am ]
The girl is mine  (She mine, she mine, she mine)
The doggone girl is mine
She like the way I rock
The way I rock
The way I rock
The way I rock
I know she's mine  (She mine, she mine, she mine)
The doggone girl is mine
She like the way I rock
The way I rock
The way I rock
The way I rock

[Verse 2: will.i.am,  Michael Jackson ]
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours, not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time

[Chorus: Michael Jackson,  will.i.am ]
Because she's mine  (She mine, she mine, she mine)
The doggone girl is mine
She like the way I rock
The way I rock
The way I rock
The way I rock
Don't waste your time
Your time, don't waste your time, don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson]
I love you more than he  Take you anywhere
Well, I love you endlessly  Loving we will share
So come and go with me
To one's town
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other

[Verse 4: Michael Jackson]
Don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind

[Chorus: Michael Jackson,  will.i.am ]
The girl is mine  (She mine, she mine, she mine)
The doggone girl is mine
She like the way I rock
The way I rock
The way I rock
The way I rock
Don't waste your time
Your time, don't waste your time, don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
She like the way I rock
The way I rock
The way I rock
The way I rock

[Verse 5: will.i.am]
She love the way I love her low, the way I love her high  (love her high)
She loves to say hello and never say goodbye  (say goodbye)
I call her mommy and she call me papa
I'm sorry Mike, but she love the way I rock-ah
And you know, you know, you know, I really care
And she know, she know, the love is right here
And I know, I know, the love is real true
And now they know, they know, just how they really do
They like the way I rock
The way I rock
The way I rock
The way I rock
The way I rock
The way I rock
The way I rock
The way I rock
The way I roll with it, the way I rock with it
The way I rock with the King of Pop, nonstop with it
The way I rock, the way, the way I rock
The way I rock, the way I rock
I rock, I rock

[Outro: will.i.am]
Will.i.am nonstop
Rolling with the King of Pop
MJ, make it hot
Yeah
You like the way I rock
The way I rock
The way I rock
The way I rock
The way I rock
The way I rock
The way I rock
The way I rock

[Verse 1]
Yea yea yea!
Oh girl
I remember you Calling, saying
That things were through with us
I have a hard time feeling within
Just started moving on
Got back my feeling chilling
Started chilling getting back with it

[Chorus]
Now I seem to be everywhere lately
Too much to be coincidental
Why you want to lead me on
I am not the one you want
So girl do not keep me hanging
You would not let me let go
Got me thinking it is on
Girl you know that you are wrong
You would not, you would not let me let go
Heart always ringing my phone
Goodbye do not mean hello
Love, you leave me alone
You would not! You would not let me let go

[Verse 2]
Ooh yeah
When we started dating making
Moves on the single scene
Never seen you so jealous
Telling all the other girls that you are still with me
You may think it is funny honey
I am not laughing
You know what I think about it

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You would not let me let go
Got me thinking it is on
Girl you know that you are wrong
You would not, you would not let me let go
Heart always ringing my phone
Goodbye do not mean hello
Love, you leave me alone
You would not! You would not let me let go

You would not let me let go
Got me thinking it is on
Girl you know that you are wrong
You would not, you would not let me let go

[Intro/Chorus]
Calling on the Night Line
Waking me up
Calling on the Night Line (Calling on the Night Line)
Can't get enough

Whisper in my ear
Sending through the fire line (Calling on the Night Line)
What I'd like to hear

[Verse 1]
No sense pretending it's over
Hard times just don't go away
You got to take that chip off your shoulder
It's time you open up, have some faith
Nothing good ever comes easy
All good things come in due time, yes it does
You got to have something to believe in
I'm telling you to open your mind

[Chorus]
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna make it right
You've got to reach out and try
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna get it right
Gotta put it all on the line

[Verse 2]
You see yourself in the mirror
And you don't like what you see, ooh
And things aren't getting much clearer
Don't you think it's time you go for a change, oh!
Don't waste your time on the past, no, no
It's time you look to the future, oh
It's all right there if you ask
This time if you try much harder
You will be the best that you can be, ooh!

[Chorus]
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna make it right
You've got to reach out and try
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna get it right
Gotta put it all on the line

[Bridge]
If you wanna make it right (If you wanna make it right)
And you wanna do it now (Do it now)
Then you gotta learn to try (Then you gotta learn to try)
And you'll make it work somehow (Make it work somehow)
No, nothing in life comes free
And that's just the way it is, now
You gotta go for what you want
You gotta know what you've got to stand for

[Chorus]
Gotta put your heart on the line
(Gotta put it all, on the line, you and me)
If you wanna make it right (Hoo!)
You've got to reach out and try (Hoo! You and me!)
Gotta put your heart on the line
(Gotta put it all, gotta put it all)
If you wanna get it right (Hoo, hoo, hee!)
Gotta put it all on the line (Hee!)
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna make it right
You've got to reach out and try
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna get it right
Gotta put it all on the line
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna make it right
You've got to reach out and try
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna get it right
Gotta put it all on the line

[Intro]
Uh huh, alright...

[Verse 1]
This time going to do my best to make it right
Can't go on without you by my side, hold on
Shelter come and rescue me out of this storm
And out of this cold, I need someone
Oh why oh why why why...
(If you see her)
Tell her this for me
All I need is...

[Chorus]
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(See)
(One more)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more)
One more chance at love
(Alright)
One more chance at love

[Verse 2]
Searching for that one who's going to make me whole
Help me make these mysteries unfold, hold on
Lightning about to strike and rain only on me
Hurt so bad sometimes it's hard to breathe
Oh why why
(If you see her)
Tell her this from me
All I need is...

[Chorus]
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more chance for love)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love

[Bridge]
And I would walk around this world to find her
And I don't care what it takes no, why
I'd sail the seven seas to be near her
And if you happen to see her
See, tell her this from me

[Chorus]
One more chance at love
(Yeah, yeah)
One more chance at love
(Tell her this from me) (Yeah, yeah)
One more chance at love
(Yeah, yeah)
One more chance at love
(One more chance at loving)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(Loving you)
One more chance at love
(I can't find)
One more chance at love
(Loving you) (Yeah)
One more chance at love
(One more)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(For love)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(I can't stop) (Yeah)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(Loving you)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(I can't stop)
One more chance at love
(Loving you) (Yeah, yeah) (Hoo!)
One more chance at love
(I can't stop)
One more chance at love

[Verse 1]

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Da da da, dee dee dee
In the Black Hills of North Virginia
What have I learned?

[Chorus]
That people all over the world
People from country to country
One and the same in the world
And one song we sing
Life should be harmony
In this world of self-destruction
Nations lift your voices and sing

[Verse 2]
I've been to Naples and I
I've been to Georgia and I
Da n'da, da n'da, dee de da

People from country to country
People all over the world
People all over the world

People all over the world

[Verse 1]
It is time you put away your fear
And It is time try to dream a little big
It is time to give your dreams another chance
And It is time to take away the will in hand

To the flames that is burning strong
To the rain that is coming on
I will be holding on to memories
I can make it on my own

[Chorus]
I believe I am ready to win
I know I am ready to soar
If you pick me up when I down
Turn it all around
I know I am ready to win

[Verse 2]
They say It is a miracle today (Oh my)
You are never going far today (Hold on)
Life is your chance (Oh no)
You got your chance
Go get your win
It feels like I can fly with broken wings
Now the wind is blowing strong
I can do it on my own
I can do it all alone now
And I am never turning back again

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
They say I am dreaming life away
(They say I am throwing it all away)
And I cannot get back my yesterday (Dream again)
So I say I never saw love without you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Call my name!
(I know I am ready to win)
And I know I am ready to win
You and me, baby
I believe it, baby
(I know I am ready to win)
I know I will win
(I know I am ready to win)
Sing, yeah!
Baby, I know!
(I know I am ready to win)
Yeah, yeah, I believe
(I know I am ready to win)

[Intro: SK Laflare]
It's money
It's money
It's money
It's money
It's money
All day
All day

[Verse 1: SK Laflare]
Baby girl, what you want to do?
Hop in this 'Cedes, girl
She like where we going to
A new life, new world
Pop that molly, we hard-body
Glocks hot as Kemosabe
He said that he wanted beef
So we fed him hollows and got it popping
Fear and ego is the enemy
You ain't got to pretend with me
I need the wool, I'ma skin the sheep
And take the bull, skin it to the meat
You full of shit, we in too deep
I do this, she knew the deet
Like two feet, Flare two time
She wanna kick it like Bruce Lee
Brought you in, I'll take you out
Ball like Tim then I weighed it out
It's no work, we sling through droughts
The life of me, I'm just hanging out
Don't get comfortable and lay on the couch
I don't wanna see your ass laying down
Pop that pussy, twerk some
'Cause most of these bitches work for nothing
Paid your dues, while you're Paid In Full
I can't wait to win, you wait to lose
Your mind of a failure, hate rules
When you settle for what you hate to do
I go the extra mile, I'm with the extras
Extended clips shoot through your necklace
Leave you breathless, that Tec is restless
'Cause All My Children need the best, bitch
I need that Rothschild money, the top is sunny
I seen the light, and you blocked it from me
But I found my way to the top, I'm coming
Got that smack-dab base, like a rock-star drummer

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
I'm a problem to niggas
Pop artillery, the carbon is with 'em
Starving to hit 'em, spar with a nigga
Just watch, I'ma kill 'em all in a minute
It's the ticket-dodging aristocrat
New bitch, whip with the system slaps
Mister slide in and skimp the sack
Nigga hit the function with a pick and axe
My nigga, miss me with the bullshit
Right here, right ear got a Pesto blunt
Why that shit got a young nigga Velcro stuck
Why your bitch go down when the sess go up
Hard as armed services, y'all might have heard of him
Escobarbarian, best call the lawyers up
Bruh, the broad Aryan, know the squad loiterers
Not with the grain and these bitch niggas' wishes
Dealt with addiction, fell for the bitch with the
Pale butter skin who just packed up and dipped
In the land of the rent-less, stand with my chips
In a stack and a grin, fuck 'em

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
I know it don't seem difficult to hit you up
But you not passionate about half the shit that you into
And I ain't havin' it
And we both know that I don't mean to offend you
I'm just focused today
And I don't know why it's difficult to admit that I miss you
And I don't know why we argue, and I just hope that you listen
And if I hurt you, I'm sorry, the music makes me dismissive
When I'm awake I'm just drifting, I'm not complaining
It's just to say that I stay pretty busy, lately
And I could be misbehaving, I just hang with my niggas
I'm fuckin' famous if you forgot, I'm faithful
Despite all what's in my face and my pocket
And this is painfully honest
And when I say it I vomit, on cloudy days when I'm salty
I play the hate to the logic
State to state for the profit, it ain't a stain on me, nigga
My momma raised me a prophet, I play for dollar incentive
And where I'm walking, it's studded, and half-retarded, I stumble
To where she park when she visit, I grab the bottle and chug it
I see the car in the distance, I know the dark isn't coming
For the moment, if I could hold it
See, it seems that

[Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt]
All my dreams got dimmer when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
And loving you is a little different, I don't like you a lot
You see, it seems like, um

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
I'm coming back, I gotta handle business
Vanish to my sleeper seat, left you at terminal three
I'll meet you down at baggage claim in a couple weeks, a fortnight
When you parade my homecoming, don't cry
You know I can't live in any place I visit
To live and die in LA
I got my Fleetwood Mac, I could get high every day
But I'd be sleepy, OCD and paranoid, so
Give me Bali beach, no molly, please, palm, no marijuana trees
Your hickeys on my aorta, and tattoos you could only see
When I'm playing surfboarder, put whiskey in that salt water
I emptied every canteen
Just to wear that straight-edge varsity you think's cool
They called me soft in high school, thank God I'm jagged
Forgot you don't like it rough, I mean, he called me a faggot
I was just calling his bluff
I mean, how anal am I gon' be when I'm aiming my gun?
And why's his mug all bloody? That was a three-on-one
Standing ovation at Staples, I got my Grammys and gold
Polka dots on my Brit, I'm not supposed to be stunting
It's all melodic, this song
I catch this vibe in my sleep, but I'm just jet-lagged is all
And restless

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
All my dreams got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Loving you's a little different I don't like you a lot
I mean… fuck

[Outro: Both, Frank Ocean, Earl Sweatshirt]
I don't know what we're about
What good is West Coast weather if you're bi-polar?
If I'ma need this sweater, I'd rather be where it's cold
Where it snows, I see how it goes
I put the flowers in bowls, I know they're coming in droves
You'll only miss when it goes
Yeah, I think that's it
When it goes

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
After filling my reputation of whore beaters
Soared to Taco Bell and I ordered some gorditas (Mmm, that's good!)
Wanted four more, ordered 'em, didn't eat 'em
Then head to Thebe's house for some gymnastics
Fantastic, I backflip on this beat, B
Cause we running shit like the Dingleberries on four cheetahs
Flow colder than Papa Joe's, old Domino's
Fuck it, whatever
Um... Trashwang scratched inside the knucks
Got some One Direction tickets, I should hit that up
Drive by with puppy signs plastered on the truck
Then see how many of they fans could fit inside the trunk
Move over the microwave and the cannabis
Try to take the van and the whole band to Canada
Fuck the block news and the venues, they can't handle us
They can't stand us including fruits that Frank's channeling
The Ku Klux Klan see me and my managers
But thank me when they ask where the Five Panels is
Man, I suck now, I ain't still dope
But Chris and Rihanna's fuckin' again so there's still hope
Oh fuck, I went there, balling bitch, I'm Ben's hair
Y'all barely breaking like Taco's self-esteem in a thin chair
Old Navy bitches love this gap, yeah this grin's rare
Watch a nigga smile like five-year-old child
I'm kicking it with Nak and the nigga from Green Mile, it's
Red Bull in this cup so a nigga may seem wild but
That's just all the sherm I was burning a little while ago (Oh no)
Don't let me get hold of that rifle
Shout my nigga Sage Elsseser and Sean Pablo
Surrounded by them niggas that skate with a sick style
And some freckled bitches with giant peaches that's vile
They never did catch that rhino

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Squadron full of some lost souls
Sergeant of all, it's autumn and Nak just nollied a pothole
Non-cooperative with his momma's wishes for college
And coppers labeled a  problem since paying for Damianos
So shimmy through the swamp, nigga, follow me through the foxholes
Moral Orenthal with a pretty bitch in a Bronco
Hopped right off the seven and stumbled into some Vatos
Threw a punch, got jumped, dusted off and then walked home
Shit, it's like 6 P.M. and his temple throbbing
Hand in the cabinet by seven, sniff the prescription oxies
Logo in the boxes, all my niggas hostile
Cautious of your crosses, scoffing at your doctrines
Bitches augmented, stupid, as the group is, only slightly
Write precise to get a pussy nigga tooth chipped
Man these stitches shut the loose lips, stumbled in a Ruth's Chris
Slid into a booth and hid the luggage from his shroom trips
See, Lionel ball with Leonardo on the weekend now
And Maui on a scenic route, we on the second season now
Small fry got 'em seasons salty, weeded, coughing
Ease up off me, end is breathing easy as bulimics barfing
From a different breed of doggy, from a different seed and cloth
And teeing off, believe it's Golf Wang, nigga

[Verse]
Salmon skin Band-Aid help with recovery
Diction buttery, grass depending
Your nigga was switching passed depending on where the rudder swings
Snapping like the shutter speed, pucker up, kiss of death
Tell your men to hit the deck or hit the dirt
Killing who you send in first, verse wintergreen spit it, show 'em that I meant it
Ho, I'm rolling with my niggas, find a gold and call the chemist
Show up solo to the scrimmage, throw a brick and pour the Henny
Don't defend it, it's useless nigga
Up to my wrist in the cooler gripping the brew in this music shit
For Versace suicidal, I hit the Jake, threw the rifle
And tell her open that mouth for deposit, leave the bank broke
Sliding in, she smiling and fidgeting, pull my face close
Streaming down the street from what 'roma was stank though
Product of the villainy, product capable, plainclothes
Rhyme with no niggas who probably was gonna remain broke

[Verse 1]
Gorgeous chrome-plated horse whip
Home-making paintings from poor quality porn flicks
Court adjourned and the verdict's still saucy
Sack swaying like Dub-D40 on a door hinge
Good lord walk light like the floor slick
Look bored hoard all mics in a force grip
Pro-abortion endorsing his own importance and
Leaving opponents floating with paper in dirty porcelain
Pinnacle of titillating crisp spit
Fist clinched emulating '68 Olympics
Rock it from the cradle 'til he middle aged and limp sticked
Coughing from the stank will probably indicate a spliff's lit
Dismissed, feel it in that saturated cranium..

[Verse 1]
Well same old Bobby, same old beat
Well yeah they got nothing on me
The same old cars, same old streets
But yeah they got nothing on me
And easy come and easy go
Well yeah I'm sure I told you so
Well they just want you for your dough
Man I'm sure I told you so
And while your dead-end job
Has been eating away your life
You feel little inside
The trouble and strife
And now you spend your evenings
Searching for another life
And yeah I think, mate
I think you've got them in your sights

[Chorus]
Well, easy easy
There's no need to take that tone
Well easy
I'm on the telephone
Man just leave us alone

[Verse 2]
Ow no I should've kept my receipt
Cause the sandwich I bought
Yeah it's been off for a week
And 'low Tesco's stealing my money
When positivity seems hard to reach
I keep my head down and my mouth shut
Cause if you’re going through hell
You just keep going

[Outro]
You're easy, so easy
You're easy
Man just leave us alone
I'll be one minute on the phone

[Verse 1]
You got to get back every rhyme
Going to jump back
She won't get it
I got a feeling but giving you, I
And I'm so damn
So damn glad about it
I got a feeling
That your jumping around
Going to get back
She won’t  get it
I got to feeling
Like jumping around
And I'm so damn
So damn glad about it

[Chorus]
Serious effect on me, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect on me, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect, baby, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect, baby, baby
Serious
And I'm so damn glad about it

[Verse 2]
I got to feeling
Of giving you, I
Won't jump back
She won’t let it
I got a feeling
Like nothing around
And I'm so damn
So damn glad about it
She don't smoke
She don't do weed
She don't hash
She don't dope
But she's a liar
I got a feeling
Like nothing around
And I'm so damn
So damn glad about it

[Chorus]
Serious effect on me, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect on me, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect, baby, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect, baby, baby
Serious
And I'm so damn glad about it

[Rap: LL Cool J]
She's serious
Makin' me delirious
I'm curious
Next thing I know
Hitting us
Enjoying
The animal magnetism
She's too hot to touch
Too cool for criticism
Each and every things
Like a mini movie being filmed
'Cause I'm the captain
And my body's the helm
I'm shivering, quivering
I smile while I'm delivering
Get some love and passion
It's never been
So intense and spiritual like
In sense of above, against
And all off in silence
Then I scream like a man
Out of his wits
'Cause that's how serious
Her serious effect is

[Chorus]
Serious effect on me, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect on me, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect, baby, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect, baby, baby
Serious
And I'm so damn glad about it

[Interlude]
Ho!
She mentioned that I was
She mentioned that I was
(Serious)
Jumping around
I got to break down
(Serious)
She's the one who get it
(Serious)
I got a feeling
Like jumping around
(Serious)
Cause I'm so glad
And I'm so damn glad about it

[Chorus]
Serious effect on me, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect on me, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect, baby, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect, baby, baby
Serious
And I'm so damn glad about it
Serious
Serious on me
Serious
Serious on me
Serious
Serious on me
Serious
Serious on me
Serious
Serious on me

[Verse 1]
She was my life and my greatest star
She was my life when I lost my faith
I never knew how much she loved me
Perhaps it could be, cause she never felt like I've

[Pre-Chorus]
She had my hand and she gave me a break
Why did she hurt me that way

[Chorus]
She was my baby but it doesn't matter anymore
She was my love and now she's gone
They told me you don't know about this girl
She was loving me

[Verse 2]
She was my dream and my happiness
She was my friend and my deepest journey
Now I can’t stand seeing her face again
Perhaps it could be, cause she's got someone else

[Pre-Chorus]

Stone shaker, your here tonight
You've got to, you love maker

You can't remember when you smiled
You know it's going to take some time

Heart-walker, I'm here to touch
You've got to, Night-stalker

You feel you need a hand to hold
Then maybe you and I
Can make it on our own

Bring out some Slapstick (turning me on)
Bring out some magic (your number one)

Because the Slapstick love, will make you smile

That heart-breaker, has gone away
So baby, you don't fake it
Let your heart play
There's more than love, that we can make
Your holding it behind your eye, (yeah, yeah)
Some feeling, you can't explain

Lying in bed's flame
It's spinning round and round again
And baby you and I
Can make it on our own

Give me some Slapstick (turning me on)
Bring out the magic (your number one)
I want some Slapstick (making me high)

[Ad-libs to fade]

[Verse 1]
She dances in the sheets at night
She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep
She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school

[Chorus]
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love

[Verse 2]
She dances for the man at work
Who works her overtime
She can't be rude as she says
"Sir, I must be home tonight"
She dances to the kitchen stove
Dinner is served by nine
He says his food's an hour late
She must be out her mind

[Chorus]
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love (Oh)
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love

[Bridge]
She works so hard just to make a way
For a man to just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains

[Verse 3]
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed the pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

[Chorus]
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love (Love, love, love)
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of

[Outro]
You got to have pride (A rhythm of love)
To give it, want it, do it, baby (A rhythm of love)

[Verse 1]
Heard he grew up in Queens
Got a bullet to the brain
Dug a step into fame
But that don't mean a thing
Said he rather be king
But with an absolute reign
'Till he finds himself a victim of the game

(He was stabbed in the back, as a matter of fact)
Then his life became serious

[Chorus]
Marching like the soldier
Marching like a soldier boy
Show you the things that make a man a king
Marching like the soldier
Marching like a soldier boy
Why don’t you shine like you’re the man again

[Verse 2]
People say that you’re blind
Then they say that you’re fine
But they won’t help you find, find the road again
But they won’t help you fight
So they torture your mind
They leave you delirious
Oh my

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
No, no
No, no
Baby, baby
Hee, hee, hee
No, no
Baby, baby
Hee, hee, hee

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Intro]
Never try to talk about it
It's got to sound good to me inside
I have to think about it

[Verse 1]
I'm so undemanding
Cause they say love is blind
I've lived this life pretending
I can bear this hurt deep inside

The truth is that I'm longing
A love that's so divine
I've searched this whole world wishing
She'll be there time after time

[Chorus]
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out a heart that needs your love

[Verse 2]
I've lived my life the lonely
A soul that cries of shame
With handicapped emotions
Save me now from what still remains

I'll be your story hero
I'll serenade in rhyme
I'm just needing that someone
Save me now from the path I'm on

[Chorus]
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
Cause all I do is hand out a heart that needs your love
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out a heart that needs your love

[Bridge]
When you say we will dance 'til the light of day
It's just like the children running with joy
When we pray will you promise me you'll always stay
It's because I'm needing that someone

[Chorus]
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
Cause all I do is hand out a heart that needs your love
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out
Love

[Verse 1]
Never have I ever been so sure (Oh no, now)
Never thought I'd see you walk in that door (Oh now, yeah)
I can make you feel (Like you're a queen)
No remedies (No compromise)
Would you rather be, right here with me?
I want you right here next to me

[Chorus]
Do you really want to stay? (We can take it slow)
Do you want to walk away? (We can let it go)
Girl I'm writing you this letter just to say goodbye
I'll be standing in the rain, in case you change your mind (Say goodbye)
Do you really want to stay? (We can take it slow)
Do you really want to go? (We can let it go)
So I'm writing you this letter just to say goodbye
I'll be standing in the rain, in case you change your mind

[Verse 2]
She never thought she'd be here waiting on me (Oh no, now)
I'd never thought I'd be here back in my ways (We can take it slow)
Oh, when you're in need
Your fantasy (All here with me)
Would you rather be, right here with me?
Girl get into me

[Chorus]
Do you really want to stay? (We can take it slow)
Do you want to walk away? (We can let it go)
Girl I'm writing you this letter just to say goodbye (Don't you walk away)
I'll be standing in the rain, in case you change your mind (Say goodbye)
Do you really want to stay? (We can take it slow)
Do you really want to go? (Don't you say goodbye)
So I'm writing you this letter just to say goodbye
I'll be standing in the rain, in case you change your mind

[Bridge]
Anything, oh anything
To chase the rain goodbye
When you left with all your dreams
I couldn't say goodnight
She was contagious, she was contagious
She was my baby
Te quiero, I love you
Say goodbye, say goodbye

[Chorus]
Do you really want to stay? (We can take it slow)
Do you want to walk away? (We can let it go)
Girl I'm writing you this letter just to say goodbye (Don't walk away)
I'll be standing in the rain, in case you change your mind (Don't go away)
Do you really want to stay? (Stay by my side)
Do you really want to go? (Stay by my side)
So I'm writing you this letter just to say goodbye
I'll be standing in the rain, in case you change your mind

[Outro]
I'll never you go (Do you want to walk away?)
I'll never you go
Never you go (I'll be standing in the rain, in case you change your mind)
I'll never you go (Do you really want to stay?)
Do you really want to go?
So I'm writing you this letter just to say goodbye
I'll be standing in the rain, in case you change your mind
Don't go away
Stay by my side
Stay by my side

Then my niggas squad up
If you got trees fire it up, fire it up

[Verse 1: Freeway]
This is for the Gs, and this is for hustlas
This is for the hustlas, now back to the Gs
Free packed intro, tech with a muffler
Bring it on you busters, watch you niggas flee
He's making a killing off putting his life on Pro Tools
The new school, the rap version of Aaron Jones
The hair and bones
To rock Jane, to cocaine, to spit game
To get us, they get tucked
Nigga don't get gassed up, might get blast up
It ain't about being tough, but even in them interviews
Every time you see me got a semi in the tuck
Chickens at the label like leave the gat at home
You know those Hip-Hop cops got it in for you
They got it in for us, but they ain't bending us
We got a infra strong enough to flip a code

[Hook]
Niggas want beef ride up

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
This is for the Gs, and this is for hustlas
This is for the hustlas, now back to the Gs
Cops trying to cease my beans
No nice clothes were caught in the morning
Trying to crease my jeans
I remember me as a young buck
Trying to put work in
Same pants for two weeks
But I would iron the dirtiness real
Back then the battle was urgent
Now days you see me in the same shit
I didn't have the detergent
I'm riding Six and Park
You used thought you knew like the back of your hand
Turn around and give the glove
So I learn to stay with you
Cause when your wheels look like Terminator 2
It'll turn your man into a hater, true
Hopefully the pain will stay past then
As what's to come, it's better that what has been
Think about it, but if his problems keep playing, solvem'
Joey and Freeway, still hood, still starving, nigga

This is for the hustlas, now back to the Gs
My big Unc still fucking with customers
Greyhound not in town, moving them keys
Hoopty or V12, I'm moving them keys
Niggas know me well, can't move me with ease
Go in your pockets at, take all your cheese
That's how I make my profit, rob y'all when 'ya sleep
It's the black Clark Kent, Superman of this rap shit
Play Superman when them gats spit, and them Kryptonite hollowtips
Make you backflip, then chaperone you to a casket
It's real
Goddamn, there's no man like I am that can compose the skills of a genius
I'm not Hip-Hop's future, I'm Hip-Hop's Fred Krueger
A new nightmare, I'm right there
With the head of Lucifer killing you demons
God's children, what can you do to us?
This rap shit ain't new to us
Been real, since Mama was stroller scootin' us
Y'all better get used to us, I'm my own scout nigga
How you recruiting us?
Heh, I call your bluff, they said stop
But then the people said it wasn't enough, nigga

[Verse 1: Akon]
I met her on the walkway
Staring as she walked pass
She looked back at me sideways and said
I can't help but to ask
I said, "You wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'"
We end up goin' back to her place
Wish I could tell you what I saw
The sexiest women in a negligee
We hit it off until the morning
You heard her say

[Hook: Akon]

Billie Jean is always talkin' when nobody else is talkin'
Tellin' lies and rubbin' shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', spyin'
Sayin' you just want to be startin' somethin'

[Chorus: Akon]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson]
You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', lyin'
You got my baby cryin' (Hee)

[Chorus: Akon & Michael]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 4 : Akon]
It's gettin' a little crazy (It's gettin' a little crazy)
Always messin' with my baby (Messin' with my baby)
And that's the reason she cries
When I am not by her side
I have the loneliest night (Without my baby)
But what I love 'bout you
Always pop up when I'm thinking about you
I want to bring back the night and share that look on your face
When you say

I'm the light of the world, I feel grand
Got this love, I can feel
And I know yes for sure, it is real

[Post-Chorus: with The Jacksons]
And it feels as though I've seen your face a thousand times
And you said you really know me too yourself
And I know that you have got addicted with your eyes
But you say you going to live it for yourself, oh

[Refrain: with The Jacksons]
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan (My plan)
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on, baby, just understand

[Chorus 2: with The Jacksons]
This is it, I can say
I'm the light of the world, runaway
We can feel, this is real
Every time I'm in love, that I feel

[Post-Chorus 2: with The Jacksons]
And I feel as though I've known you since a thousand years
And you tell me that you've seen my face before
And you said to me you don't want me hanging 'round
Many times want to do it here before, oh yeah

[Refrain: with The Jacksons]
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan (My plan)
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on, baby, just understand

[Chorus 3]
This is it (This is it), I can feel (I can feel)
I'm the light of the world, this is real
Feel my song, we can say
And I tell you I feel that way

[Post-Chorus]
And I feel as though I've known you for a thousand years
And you said you want some of this yourself
And you said you want to go with me all the while
And I know that it's really true myself, oh yeah

[Refrain: with The Jacksons]
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan (My plan)
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on, please dear, understand (Understand)
Ah-ayy
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan (My plan)
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on, please dear, understand (Understand)

[Outro]
Never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan

[Verse 1]
I don't want to move when I'm in her hands
There's nothing I can do or say. Uh!
Put everything on hold. Cancel all my plans
Tell everybody I'm away - Hey
She may be bad, but she feels so good
I'll give her anything she wants

[Chorus]
She's trouble (I know it)
She only needs to touch me
I'm in trouble (I know it) He! O
She's trouble (I love it)
I know just when she does it
I'm in trouble (I know it)

[Verse 2]
I never knew what's running through her mind
No telling what she's going to do - e
Her every move is like a danger sign
And daring me to come on through - Hey!
She may be bad, but she feels so good
I give her anything she wants

[Chorus]
She's trouble (I know it)
She only needs to touch me
I'm in trouble (I know it) He! O
She's trouble (I love it)
I know just when she does it
I'm in trouble (I know it)

[Verse 3]
She's trouble
She knows what I like
I got a feeling I'm falling (Going in trouble)
Trouble
There's no hope in sight
I'm in way over my head

[Chorus]
She's trouble (I know it)
She only needs to touch me
I'm in trouble (I know it) O!
She's trouble (I love it)
I know just when she does it
I'm in trouble (I know it) O!

[Outro]
She's trouble (I know it)
Only needs to(I know it)
(I know it)
(I love it)

[Repeat]

[Verse 1]
Feeling like this is the end of the world
Missing on the chance to fall in love (I do got it)
Feeling like your love is dangerous, but I love you, girl
Feeling like I'm never good enough
Let the heaven open, it's raining in heaven
Feels like warm July

We'll be something new, I'm here for you
And there's no need to cry

[Chorus]
Heaven's like water, water
Drowning my love, it feels like
Heaven's like water, water
People leave me alone
Heaven's like water, water
What am I to do?

[Verse 2]
Feeling like this is the start of something new
Feeling like this is the world of me and you
Cause you aren’t judging me, You just touching me
You aren’t bugging me, I'm waiting on you
I'm hoping it's true, baby, it's you
When the storm is ranging
We can walk the moon
Girl, I love you, you're my fortune
You keep me alive

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I lie awake, I count the days
When I'm not there with you, I cry my eyes away
I'd rather stay, I rather play again
When I'm not there with you forever, always
(Water, water)
Don't you do this to me

Tell the angels no
I don't want to leave my baby alone
Won't you leave us alone
Tell the angels no
I don't want to leave my baby alone

It feels like, leave us alone
(Water, water)
Leave us alone, it feels like
(Water, water)

How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
(Water, water, water)
(It's like water, water)

[Outro]
All over me, it's all over me
(It's like water, water, like water)
All over me, it's all over me, it's all
All over me (Water)
It's all over me
(Water, it's like water, water)

[Verse 1]
There comes a time when we heed a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
And it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all

We can't go on pretending day by day
That someone, somewhere will soon make a change
We all are a part of God's great big family
And the truth, you know
Love is all we need

[Chorus]
We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

[Verse 2]
Send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
As God has shown us by turning stone to bread
So we all must lend a helping hand

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
When you're down and out, there seems no hope at all
But if you just believe there's no way we can fall
Well, well, well
Let's realize that a change can only come
When we stand together as one

[Chorus]
VERSE 1

[Celine Dion]: How many people will have to die before we will take a stand?
How many children will have to cry, before we do all we can?
If sending your love is all you can give
To help one live
How many times can we turn our heads
And pretend we cannot see

[Mariah Carey]: Healing the wounds of our broken earth
We are one global family
Just sending your prayers

[Beyoncé]: Is something you'll feel
Helping one heal

CHORUS
What have I got that I can give?
What have I got that I can give?
(Tell me)
What have I got that I can give?

CHORUS
What have I got that I can give?

[Luthor Vandross]: (Is not allowed to give just a little bit)
What have I got that I can give?

[Luthor Vandross]: (Everyone should be a part of it)
To love and to teach you

VERSE 3

[Michael Jackson]: Say the words
I'll lay me down for you

Such hate and cruelty?
We should give over and over again

CHORUS

Escape (Ow!)
Escape (Ow!)
Escape

[Verse 1]
Everywhere I turn, no matter where I look
The system's in control, it's all ran by the book
I've got to get away, so I can free my mind
Escape is what I need, away from electric eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter where I am, I see my face around
They pin lies on my name, then push them town to town
Don't have a place to run, but there's no need to hide
I've got to find a place, but I won't hide away

[Chorus]
Escape (Escape)
I gotta get away from a system
Lose in the world today
Escape (Escape)
The pressure that I face from relationships
Had to go away

The man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man
Escape (Escape)
I do what I wanna, 'cause I gotta face nobody, but me
Escape

[Verse 2]
I tried to share my life with someone I could love
But games and money is all she ever thought of
How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?
I'm tired of silly games, it's time to make a change

[Pre-Chorus]
Why is it I can't do whatever I want to? (Oh)
When it's my personal life and I don't live for you (You)
So don't you try to tell me what is right for me
To be concerned about you, I can't do what I want to

[Chorus]
Escape
I gotta get away from a system
Lose in the world today
Escape (I got to get away)
The pressure that I face from relationships
Had to go away (Don't you know I need it)
Escape
The man with the pen
That writes the lies that hassle this man (I got to get away)
Escape
I do what I want to, 'cause I got to face nobody, but me
Escape (Get away)
Escape
I got to get away from a system (Don't you try it)
Lose in the world today
Escape
The pressure that I face from relationships

Had to go away

This problem world won't bother me
This problem world won't bother me
Yeah, oh, yeah (Ooh)

[Verse 1]
You can't win, you can't break even
And you can't get out of the game
People keep saying things are going to change
But they look just like they're staying the same
You can't win, way over your head
And you only have yourself to blame

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
You can't win, chile
You can’t break even
And you can't get out of the game

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson (The Crows)]
You can't win, the world keeps moving
And you're standing far behind
People keep saying, things will get better
(Just to ease your state of mind)
(So you lean back)(And you smoke that smoke)
(And you drink your glass of wine)

[Chorus]
Sayin' you can't win, chile
You can't break even
And you can't get out of the game

[Bridge: Michael Jackson (The Crows)]
You can't win, you can't win no way
If your story stays the same
(You ain’t winning) No, no
(But it's nice to see you, I'm awfully glad you came)
(Better cool it, cause it ain't about losin')
Then the world has got no shame

[Chorus]
You can't win, chile
You can't break even
And you can't get out of the game

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson (The Crows)]
You can't win, you can't break even
Ain’t the way it's supposed to be
(You'll be spending) No, no, oh
(Your little bit of money)
While someone else rides for free
(Learn your lesson) Hoo-hoo!
(Refuel your mind before some turkey blows out your flame)

[Outro: Michael Jackson (The Crows)]
You can't win, chile
(No, you can't win) 

[4x]

You can't win, chile
You can't break even
And you can't get out of the game
You can't get out of the game
You can't get out, A-Hoooooo!
You can't get out of the game now, hah!
No, no, ah, d'ah

[Verse 1]
I don't like you but I love you
Seems that I'm always thinking of you
Oh, oh, oh, you treat me badly
I love you madly

[Chorus]
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me, yeah
I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me
Hold me, hold me

[Verse 2]
I don't want you but I need you
Don't want to kiss you but I need you
Oh, oh, oh, you do me wrong now
My love is strong now

[Chorus]
You really got a hold on me, come on
You really got a hold on me, yeah
I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me
Hold me, hold me

[Verse 3]
I want to leave you, don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend another day here
Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now
I can't quit now

[Chorus]
You really got a hold on me, come on
You really got a hold on me, baby
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me, yeah

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
Yeah
Well, I'm chilly-chill most of the time
But I make a lot of noise when I bust a fresh rhyme
I'm cooling with the posse, cold drinking pissy
Met a young girl and got cold busy

Not Abbott and Costello, just me and my mellow
Got a microphone so I don't gotta bellow (yeah)
I'm tough not yellow, I don't eat Jello
I know that I'm def, what about this fellow (tell 'em)

I'm Mike D, I'm known fly cooly (tell 'em)
Got the fly rhymes and the fresh fly woolie
Starting epidemic each and every time (time)
Girls cutting class to hear me rhyme

Stand at the bar, don't sit on a stool
Ride a Harley, not a goddamn mule
Well...kick it!
Me and my crew doing the do
Cooling around the way cause we got to
There's one more thing that you should know
Mike D is a desperado
Well, DJ Strong hold popping that weak
He punched Big Bird in his goddamn beak
Gold on my fingers, silver in my pocket
Mike went to the party and (D) tried to rock it
That party was weak, I did The Freak
I peeped out the back with the fresh unique
Got girls on my tippy back out the way (what?)
Jocking and clocking
I'm MCA (yeah)
It must be a drag just getting old
But I don't gotta worry cause I'm so damn cold
Kick it cold, cold rocking
My name is Adam Yauch and I know you all clocking

Me and my posse, oh, so killing
Stone cold fly and nive to five chilling
There's one more thing you all should know (what?)
Adrock's a desperado

M-I-K-E D-E-E-E
I'm on top and that's the way to be
I'm the stupid, def-est, always rocking
Every store in town, you know it's stocking
All of my records are records on charts (charts)
You know I'm goddamn stupid
Farther than any other record can go
Don't you know I'm rocking in stereo
I'm on the top, bottom, even in the middle
I got the def rhymes and it ain't no riddle
I'm the king of the castle with no hassle
Take a girlie to my house, we start to wrestle
Cause I'm a rebel without a pause (check it) (word)
Keep rocking and breaking laws
I got Gucci cologne so you know I'm not stinking
Got more rhymes than my boy Abe Lincoln
Get those suckers cause you know I gotta
Order a fajita and a fresh enchilada
Shot that parrot cause he used to chirp
Can't eat Chinese cause it makes me burp
Went from bar to bar, I got rejected
My fake ID, it was disrespected
Got records in London
Quit my job cause my boss is a faggot
One more thing that you should know
MCA is a desperado

[Verse 1]
And if I lost the map
If I lost it all
Or fell into the trap
Then she'd call

[Chorus 1]
When you're tired of racing and you
Found you never left the start
Come on, baby, don’t let it break your heart

[Verse 2]
Though heavily we bled
Still, on we crawl
Trying to catch a cannonball
And a slow burning tide
Through my veins is flowing
From my shipwreck, I heard her call
And she sang

[Chorus 2]
When you're tired of aiming your arrows
Still, you never hit the mark, oh-oh
And even in your rains and shadows
Still, we're never gonna part, oh-oh
Come on, baby, don’t let it break your heart

[Hook]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Don’t let it break your heart
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Don’t let it break your heart

[Outro]
Don't let it break your heart

[Verse 1]
Hawaiian tropic, dark, and a bottle of jack in the Cadillac
As I drive down the highway
You aren't coming back and I know that now
So I let the wind hit me in my face

[Chorus]
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish

[Verse 2]
Your red Hawaiian shirt and your hair jet black
Hanging 'round with your friends by the track
Baby, you can't come back from being that bad
Just to sit at home, pledge allegiance to the flag

[Chorus - Variation]
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone

[Verse 3]
Copacabana, yes in my party dress
I’m shimmering in love on that crystal meth
A Coca Cola kid, roller coaster child
You my everything, give me that baby doll smile

[Chorus - Variation 2]
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, where is mine?
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, were you lyin'?

[Bridge]
And the velvet Elvis and the rosaries
And your white Corvette under willow trees
You the one for me, my one true king

[Chorus - Variation]
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone

[Verse 4]
I remember party dresses
I remember party dresses

[Outro]
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
But sometimes it comes too late

[Intro]
You know, sometimes I think God is playing a little game with me
Looking down from Heaven, laughing
And trying to see how much I can take
Because the way things go, it's like a joke
Nobody's had more shots at the moon and missed than me

[Verse 1]
It's like I got my life stuck, stuck on rewind
Trying to make something of myself
Life's got something else in mind
I'm fighting a losing game and I'm biding my time
You won't be my man, do I understand? No, stop
I don't want to hear another word about your why nots
I bought your bullshit all before
Now you trying to sell me more, babe

[Chorus]
Man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago, nothing left to choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
I'm tired

[Verse 2]
I'm walking down the streets
You wouldn't know what I was thinking
It's just another white girl day, hey
Ribbons in my hair and I am sinking down
A double life, a sordid past and I am drinking now
I want to be bad, you say you were glad to see me, shut up
I don't want to know another thing you think you know about me
I'm not who you think I am, smiling but I ain't happy

[Chorus]
Man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago, nothing left to choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
I'm tired

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm so far gone
I can't turn off my mind, it's like a ticking time bomb
Trying to kill me from inside
Haunting day and night
Is there no remedy for memory?

[Verse 3]
I've felt this way before
I've known the depths of utter desperation
My boyfriend says I'm like an old movie star
With loneliness as my occupation
I know that he's right but I don't care tonight
I want to be bad, I want to be bad, I can't stop
I keep running around the same town
Knocking you down, I'm fucked
How can I get out when there's nowhere to go for miles around?

[Chorus]
A man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago, nothing left to choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
I'm tired

[Verse 1]
So, I heard you wanna go to Rio, baby
Yes, I seen page six lately, ah
I told you both them broads was crazy
Hackin' in your phone and shit
Diamonds and pearls, your little girl
She got the best, sparklin' like a Hollywood movie, ah-ah-ah

[Verse 2]
If you got the cash, lock it down tight
I got the looks, you got my heart right
And you love me, 'cause I'm just like neon
Lightin' up your night

[Chorus]
Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
I didn't want nothin' from you
Just to be like you, my king

[Verse 3]
I thought that you wanted a real girl, baby
You lured me in with all your gold
Catch and release, and you're so cold
Are you crazy?
You didn't know what kinda fish you caught
'Cause I am a shark, beware of my bark
I'll eat you up like the center of a tootsie pop

[Verse 4]
'Cause we were a match in heaven, high
Only one catch, Frank was the boss, right?
And it's so sad, 'cause the only way
That you know how to love is fight

[Chorus]
Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
I didn't want nothin' from you
Just to be like you, my king

[Outro]
Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
You know how I like my world on a string
You know how I like my world on a string
You know how I like my world on a string

[Intro]
Ah, Don't fuck with me

"Fuck you" attitude
You know what I wanna do
Light it up red, white and blue
Do I look high to you?
That's because I am
That's because I am
Do you know what I had to do
To get here, man!?

[Verse 2]
No no, you don't don't
Cause you're not a gangsta (Don't fuck with me)
(Scarface)
No no, you don't don't (Don't fuck with me)
Cause you're not a gangsta
Like I am

[Verse 3]
Scarface, sacrifice
Sold my soul to make it nice
It was worth it, paid the price
Life is death when blow is life
But me and my crew
We know what we like
We know how to roll
Will we ever stop?, No!

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
You're not a gangsta
Don't fuck with me (You're not a gangsta)
Don't fuck with me (You're not a gangsta)
Don't fuck with me (You're not a gangsta)
Don't fuck with me (You're not a gangsta)
Don't fuck with me (You're not a gangsta)
Like I am

[Post-Chorus]
Don't fuck with me (Oh)
Don't fuck with me (Oh)
(Oh)
Don't fuck with me (Oh)
Don't fuck with me (Oh)
Don't fuck with me!

[Bridge]
Yes, yes, yes
Don't fuck with me
(Ah)

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with me (You're not a gangsta)
(Fuck you)
You're not a gangsta
You're not a gangsta
You're not a gangsta
You're not a gangsta
Fuck!

[Verse 1]
It's like a Hollywood movie
The black and white waves sparkling truly
My man likes to watch me while I watch TV
While he's t-t-touching me

[Verse 2]
I remember vintage green wallpaper
Your criminal arms, I couldn't feel safer
King Creole daddy, chasing that paper
I l-l-love you

[Chorus 1]
Baby you'll never be old in my eyes
With your golden grill true love never dies
We're forever young in paradise
As long as you got the Chevrolet, I will ride
I will ride
I will ride

[Chorus 2]
Baby you know mama never had much money
But I plan on using this face to pay, honey
Give me give me give me give
You're so funny, love you 'til I die

[Verse 3]
Who's living life like it's the Belvedere
Swinging all night on the crystal chandelier
Bring that velvet Elvis over here

[Outro]
Come on, baby you never know 'til you try
Baby you never live 'til you die
Baby you never love 'til you're mine
C'mon you're mine, you're mine, you're mine

Look around, everywhere you turn is heartache
It's everywhere that you go (Look around)
You try everything you can to escape
The pain of life that you know (Life that you know)
When all else fails and you long to be

[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 1]
Um, it's hardly a secret
You ain't gon stop tryna get where you going until you reach it
Always had them bars back in the day
When the same ones running up on you
Wasn't speaking
Look at all your achievements
You work hard so it'd be kinda hard not to believe that
You party every weekend (weekend)
Fuck em all who act like they ain't see it then
All them nights on the plane
Buses nigga too, had to charge it to the game
Always want to start em in the fame
Learn to out smart em
And now it ain't no stopping the champagne from poppin'
The draws from droppin'
Us seeing muscle cars and coppin' em
Started off just a little less popular

[Hook]
Now you got a new place
You drive a new car
You stop all the cameras than life like a superstar
Don't care what they say
You reach for the stars
Got everything you always dreamed or thought about
And everyone knows who you are

[Wiz Khalifa- Verse 2]
Never gets boring
And haters in your face you just ignore 'em
Don't know what they talking shit for
Seems niggas get there's you just tryna get yours
Therefore, you left all the people you care for
Hopped on a plane and got airborn
Seen all the bullsh-t and fell for it
But it's all good now
Cause the same ones that talk shit telling everyone you made it
Then you start seein' hoes you dated
Then thoughts started getting jaded
Now your life's sort of different ain't it
These scars show what your pain is
But was it all worth, it's just painless
Say you wanna be famous

[Hook]
Now you got a new place
You drive a new car
You smile for the cameras live life like a superstar
Don't care what they say
You reach for the stars
Got everything you always dreamed or thought about
And everyone knows who you are
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are
Who you are
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are
Who you are

[Wiz Khalifa- Verse 3]
Always knew I was this good
But never knew I'd be this good
Them niggas just startin' I've been doing it
Hear em talk but they ain't living my life
In the dark tryna get in my life
But chances I don't 'em, dodge twice
Spendin' grands for hoes, this is the high life
And for the camera's posing this the high life
Bottles raising for my niggas not here
I pour out a couple sips
Blew em on the beach, I smoke for you on my trips
Them days I was younger I knew this life was the shit
But never like this
It's so amazing, we ain't gotta duck shots
We just pour and chase 'em
Ain't worry bout it, cause they gon hate
Know where I'm going, look where I came from

[Hook]

[Hook]
So much Ice, I should have brought my fur
After the club I might leave with her
Go tell your jewelery man to step it up
Cause man your stones ain't bright enough
Rappers think Gucci Mane should lighten up
Club night we be lighting up
Ten thousand dime pieces lining up
And all they say is "boy you blinding us"

[Verse 1]
My money growing like a chia pet, ch-ch-ch-chia
And my ears like a quarter mil, is you for real?
And my lamb is like a shark with gills, look at the rims
And my beamer coupe got spinning wheels, like they on pills
I put sixes on my old school and my Rolls Royce
Swear to god Drumma Boy I only drove that bitch once
Gucci, ball players where Gucci live, that's how we chill
My back yard big as a baseball field, That's 'fore the deal
My pocket full of old big head white dudes
Because I get forty thou just to walk through
Schedule booked up now I can't make room
Pissy jewelery like my jeweler got it from the rest room

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You niggas in the hood mad because I got cash
Probably because I ride past fast 

[through the Jag](pending)
Jumping out the back of the phantom like damn
Don't I look so motherfucking handsome, mam?
Man fuck Gucci, So Icy ain't a movement
So Icy ain't a movement? 

[Whoop the nigga] is you stupid?
Cupid shoot arrows, I shoot double barrels
Retarded ass diamond watch like Little Darryl
A nigga named Harold, who used to go to 

[Parrel]
Was found 

[------?-------] back seat of a jaguar
Homie hit a lick, 30 bricks bought a camaro
It's Gucci Mane La Flare, Just like my apparel

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It ain't legal, search and seizure, get away from vehicle
Believe, I be smoking reefer, I don't be legal

[--------------------?-----------------]

[The piece, under the seat, just like it beneath]
I bequeath me unto my sea, you know I'm a G
She petite but she such a freak, tear down the boutique
We discreet, we rack up with 

[seeks?], damn I'm such a thief
Meet your girlfriend, soon as you wink take her out to eat
Can't compete, say she incomplete, so she fucking me
The elite, Gucci Mane The G, Drumma on the beat
Wouldn't believe what you can achieve, then just look at me
Hope my life a living testimony, Gucci 

[dies a grinch]

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Mark Morrison & (singers)]
Did my time (in a) county jail
(Just when) just when things (started) going well
(And I) paid the price (for the) crimes I did
(Wanna) change my life (wanna) raise my kids

[Chorus: Mark Morrison & (singers)]
(I'm an innocent man) misunderstood
(I'm an innocent man) just from the hood
(I'm an innocent man) misunderstood
(I'm an innocent man) a man is good

[Verse 2: Mark Morrison & (singers)]
Promised her (that I) that I'll change
(Gonna) live my life (in a) better way
(Have a) little you (and a) little me
(So we) can settle down (and live) happily

[Chorus: Mark Morrison & (singers)]
(I'm an innocent man) misunderstood
(I'm an innocent man) just from the hood
(I'm an innocent man) misunderstood
(I'm an innocent man) a man is good, understood

[Verse 3: DMX]
If everyone else had my eyes
Then, who I am wouldn't be a surprise
Just because I'm locked up don't mean I'm fucked up in the game
Just a victim of the dirt they trying to throw on my name
Get arrested, but getting arrested don't make me guilty
But by the time I make it to court the media done killed me
Gotta good heart but we all do wrong
I really mean well but I'm going too strong
You say I'm rehabilitated but I still can't vote
You say I paid my debt but I still can't vote
Gotta pay taxes but I still can't vote
Come on dawg, y'all stay trying to keep a nigga broke
You just as crooked as us, fuck you trying to say
Cause once I pay that dough, the charges go away
Forget about it, it's okay
Cause I'ma walk over here and let the Lord pave my way, aight

[Verse 4: Mark Morrison & (singers)]
Change the life (that I) that I live
(Got me) living fine (living) negative
(Need to) leave the game, game (that is) destroying me
(So I) pray to God (that He) has mercy

[Outro: singers]
On an innocent man

All it takes is, some Voli on the rocks (Havana Brown)
Next thing you know, she's on top of the bar
No clothes fo'sho (Afrojack)
She's telling me to slow down, I live a fast life (Mr. Worldwide)
Funny thing is, she wasn't saying that last night-- Dale

[Chorus: Havana Brown]
I can't believe what we did last night
I'm gonna wake up in the morning sun
Going nowhere, telling everyone
I can't believe what we did last night
I wanna say oh my God, that was so much fun
I'll never forget it, telling everyone about last night

[Drop: Afrojack]

[Bridge: Pitbull]
What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas
What happens in Miami, never happened
Never happened

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Last night we were off the chain
You name it, we did it
You loved it fo'sho
I can't remember her name, but her ass; that I remember fo'sho!
Convenient amnesia
Remember the good, forget the bad
Remember the present, forget the past
She don't get down, then forget that ass

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull]
One life, two worlds; English, Spanish
One night, two girls; English, Spanish
She's telling me to slow down
I live a fast life
Funny thing is she wasn't saying that last night (Dale)

[Chorus: Havana Brown]
I can't believe what we did last night
I'm gonna wake up in the morning sun
Going nowhere, telling everyone
I can't believe what we did last night
I wanna say oh my God, that was so much fun
I'll never forget it, telling everyone about last night

[Bridge: Pitbull]
What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas
What happens in Miami, never happened
Never happened

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Different night, different city
Different girl, but it's all the same
I party every night like my last
Be careful buddy, you might run into my past
I don't got a conscience
And I don't got time to deal with the nonsense
I came to get off to everything
So alert all the bondsmen, ha

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull]
One life, two worlds; English, Spanish
One night, two girls; English, Spanish
She's telling me to slow down
I live a fast life
Funny thing is she wasn't saying that last night (Dale)

[Verse 1]
Coming to you live, from California, California
We can drive half way across the stateside of California
Would you mind if I let the top down to feel the California
And all I see in the sky is sapphire blowing clouds of diamonds
Ive got nothing, got nothing, got nothing to do nothing to do
The beach is kind of average but the mushrooms are magic
When we've got nothing got nothing got nothing to do nothing to do
Im signing off the network I hope you're down to try to
There must be something something something to do

[Verse 2]
Coming to you
From California California
We can fly half way across the world now
From California
Would you mind if I let the top down to feel the California
And if you ask me why the birds sing then you know it's true
There's never nothing nothing nothing to do
What happened to 'nobody does it better'?
See ya walking 'round like you were born to kill
Driving in your Escalade flash that golden grill
You're pickin up a bad habit you get the ones that no one will
Where did your love go babe before you turned criminal?

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing god and get out of the way

So here we are, there we go and that's the way
That you gonna roll, that you gonna fight, gonna play
It doesn't really matter to me that you find your way
You've been gone for so long that you're a shell of yourself babe

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing god and get out of the way
The sun once shined for you
I've changed my mind for you
Your golden day has turned to night
Your golden day has been denied

There's no more chances for you now, you never learn
You lit my fire baby, but I just got burned

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing god and get out of the way

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happen to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing god and get out of the way

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Mm-mm, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Come on, come on

[Verse 1]
I hope you remember me like this
Smokin' cigarettes in my sundress
Glamorous and gangster, oh yes
(My battle lines look like paradise next to you)
I hope I remember you just like that
Lookin' fresh to death in your ball cap
You say you'll tap it like a hi-hat
(Your stupid lines, they're like dynamite)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The future's looking bright as black tonight
You tell me that our love cannot endure
Baby, if it's wrong, I don't wanna be right
Oh, I don't know a thing of this, I'm sure

[Chorus]
There's nowhere on this Earth I would rather be
Than in your bedroom breathin' heavily
The way you're smilin', it's so deadly
Honey, you are heavenly, t-television heaven with you
Swingin' in New York to Nirvana's song
With nothin' but that t-t-television on
We're kissin' in the dark, in my diamonds
Put that MT-TV on, t-television heaven with you
(And now, here's Johnny!)

[Verse 2]
I wonder if you'll think of me like this
On your fire escape like a hot mess
You say, "You're beautiful but hopeless"
("Come on inside, oh, you crazy child, look at you")
I promise that I'll think of you as the king
Quotin' Corleone like you're so mean
It's Cosa Nostra cause it's our thing
(I made you mine like a thousand times)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Lucy's in the sky with ice tonight
Heaven knows I've tried hard to find a cure
Baby, if it's wrong, I don't wanna be right
And if you ask again, I'll say I'm sure

[Chorus]
There's nowhere on this Earth I would rather be
Than in your bedroom breathin' heavily
The way you're smilin', it's so deadly
Honey, you are heavenly, t-television heaven with you
Swingin' in New York to Nirvana's song
With nothin' but that t-t-television on
We're kissin' in the dark, in my diamonds
Put that MT-TV on, t-television heaven with you

[Bridge]
Stay up tonight, turn out the light
It feels so right, baby, you're a vision in blues
Stay up tonight, turn out the light
It feels so right, watching television with you

[Chorus]
There's nowhere on this Earth I would rather be
Than in your bedroom breathin' heavily
The way you're smilin', it's so deadly
Honey, you are heavenly, t-television heaven with you
Swingin' in New York to Nirvana's song
With nothin' but that t-t-television on
We're kissin' in the dark, in my diamonds
Put that MT-TV on, t-television heaven with you

[Verse 1]
Every time that you walk out on me
I regress back to the one that I can't see
He's someone I have never talked about
'Cause I know that we'd both be dead if you found out

[Verse 2]
Every time you tell me that I'm wrong
I just can't remember how to play along
There's something I have never told you
I'm not really from this world
There's something I have been with holdin'
I'm not like every other girl

[Chorus]
Loha, loha, mahi, mahi, Yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, mahi, mahi, Yoha, yoho
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for

[Verse 3]
So if you begin to think
That my light might be supernatural
I'd have to say "You're right, you're right, mon cher, it is"
I come from a place that your mind cannot even imagine
Where we sing "Maha, maha, maha, maha"

[Chorus]
Loha, loha, mahi, mahi, Yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, mahi, mahi, Yoha, yoho
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for

[Bridge]
Maha, oh Maha
Oh Maha, Maha
I give my loving, I'm your devoted
I'll give my love, babe
I'm your devoted

[Outro]
Maha, Maha, Maha, Maha
Maha, Maha, Maha

[Verse 1]
Oh yeah
Some people say my love cannot be true
Please believe me, my love, and I'll show you
I will give you those things you thought unreal
The sun, the moon, the stars, all bear my seal

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah
Follow me now and you will not regret
Leaving the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
Forever with me till the end of time

[Chorus]
Your love for me has just got to be real
Before you know the way I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel

[Verse 3]
Oh yeah
Now, I have you with me under my power
Our love grows stronger now with every hour
Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am
My name is Lucifer, please take my hand

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 4]
Oh yeah
Follow me now and you will not regret
Leaving the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
Forever with me till the end of time

[Chorus]
Your love for me has just got to be real
Before you know the way I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel

[Outro]
Oh yeah
Now, I have you with me under my power
Our love grows stronger now with every hour
Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am
My name is Lucifer, please take my hand

[Verse 1]
So you think you know what's going on inside her head
You think she wants your money, but it's you she wants instead

[Verse 2]
When you think about the things that she did long ago
It breaks your heart but deep down, boy, you don't want her to go

[Verse 3]
You feel your nerves are shattering, you feel you want to die
Just because the one mistake of telling you a lie

[Verse 4]
If I were you I'd try again and try to make amends
She only thinks of you, you know, I'm talking as a friend

[Verse 1]
Visions cupped within the flower
Deadly petals with strange power
Faces shine a deadly smile
Look upon you at your trial

[Verse 2]
Chill that numbs from head to toe
Icy sun with frosty glow
Words that glow read to your sorrow
Words that glow read "No tomorrow"

[Bridge]
Feel your spirit rise with the breeze
Feel your body falling to its knees
Take your wall of remorse
Turns your body to a corpse
Turns your body to a corpse
Turns your body to a corpse
Sleeping wall of remorse
Turns your body to a corpse

[Verse 3]
Now from darkness, there springs light
Wall of sleep is cool and bright
Wall of sleep is lying broken
Sun shines in, you have awoken

[Verse 1]
My name it means nothing, my fortune is less
My future is shrouded in dark wilderness
Sunshine is far away, clouds linger on
Everything I possessed, now, they are gone
They are gone, they are gone...

[Verse 2]
Oh, where can I go to and what can I do?
Nothing can please me, only thoughts are of you
You just laughed when I begged you to stay
I've not stopped crying since you went away
You went away, you went away...

[Verse 3]
The world is a lonely place, you're on your own
Guess I will go home, sit down and moan
Crying and thinking is all that I do
Memories I have remind me of you
Of you, of you...

[Verse 1]
I see the look of evil in your eyes
You've been filling me all full of lies
Sorrow will not change your shameful deeds
You will bear someone else's fertile seed

[Chorus]
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me

[Verse 2]
Now I know just what you're looking for
You want me to claim this child you bore
Well, you know that it was he, not me
And you know the way it's got to be

[Chorus]
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me

[Verse 3]
Wickedness lies in your moistened lips
Your body moves just like the crack of a whip
Black cat sleeps on top of your stained bed
Don't you wish that you could see me dead?

[Chorus]
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me

[Verse 1]
The world today is such a wicked place
Fighting going on between the human race
People go to work just to earn their bread
While people just across the sea are counting their dead

[Verse 2]
A politician's job they say is very high
For he has to choose who's gotta go and die
They can put a man on the Moon quite easy
While people here on Earth are dying of old diseases

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
A woman goes to work every day after day
She just goes to work just to earn her pay
Child sitting crying by a life that's harder
He doesn't even know who is his father

[Verse]
Red sun rising in the sky
Sleeping village cock’rel’s cry
Soft breeze blowing in the trees
Peace of mind, feel at ease

[Intro]
One, two, three, four!
Baby Bottle Pop, baby bottle pop
You can lick it, shake it, and dunk it
Sweet candy fun!

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby Bottle Pop, baby bottle Pop
You can lick it, shake it and dunk it

[Chorus]
I love it
Gotta have it
Never see me without it my baby
Baby Bottle Pop!

[Chorus]
I love it
Gotta have it
There’s no seeing me without it my baby, yeah
Uh oh, oh!

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby Bottle Pop, baby bottle pop
You can lick it, shake it and dunk it
Sweet candy fun!

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby Bottle Pop, baby Bottle Pop
You can lick it, shake it and dunk it
Uh! Oh! Uh! Oh, oh! Uh oh, oh!

[Outro]
Baby Bottle Pop, baby bottle pop
You can lick it, shake it and dunk it

[Verse 1]
Now, the first day that I met ya
I was looking in the sky
When the sun turned all a blur
And the thunderclouds rolled by
The sea began to shiver
And the wind began to moan
It must've been a sign for me
To leave you well alone

[Chorus]
I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong

[Verse 2]
You never said you love me
And I don't believe you can
'Cause I saw you in a dream
And you were with another man
You looked so cool and casual
And I tried to look the same
But now I've got to love ya
Tell me who have I to blame?

[Chorus]
I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong

[Instrumental Bridge 1]

[Verse 3]
Now, the whole wide world is movin'
'Cause there's iron in my heart
I just can't keep from cryin'
'Cause you say we've got to part
Sorrow grips my voice
As I stand here all alone
And watch you slowly take away
A love I've never known

[Chorus]
I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Just a little bit too strong

[Instrumental Bridge 2]

[Verse 4]
Now, the whole wide world is movin'
'Cause there's iron in my heart
I just can't keep from cryin'
'Cause you say we've got to part
Sorrow grips my voice
As I stand here all alone
And watch you slowly take away
A love I've never known

[Chorus]
I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Just a little bit too strong

[Verse 1]
Inclination of direction
Walk and turn and twist adrift
With the children of creation
Futuristic dreams we sift
Clutching violently we whisper
With a liquefying cry
Any deadly final answers
That are surely doomed to die

[Verse 2]
Won’t you help me, Mister Jesus
Won’t you tell me if you can
When you see this world we live in
Do you still believe in Man
If my song’s become my freedom
And my freedom turns to gold
Then I’ll ask the final question
If the answer could be sold

[Bridge]
Well, that’s my story and I’m sticking to it
’Cause I got no reason to lie, yeah
Forget your problems that don’t even exist
And I’ll show you a way to get high
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah!
So come alive, you know you’re magic to me
Remember freedom is not hard to find, yeah
Time to stop all your messing around
Don’t you think I know my own mind
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah!

Why can’t you believe, it's right here to be seen
Do you always have to be told, yeah
For you and your problem, you can never give up
Long before the answer was sold
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah!

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
I walked across the crowded street
A sea of eyes, they cut through me
And I saw you in the middle
Your upset face, you wear it well
You camouflage the way you feel
When everything's the matter

[Pre-Chorus]
We've all been down that road before
Searching for that something more

[Chorus]
World's spinning 'round
There's no sign of slowing down
So, won't you take a breath?
Just take a breath
People change and promises are broken
Clouds can move and skies will be wide open
Don't forget to take a breath

[Verse 2]
Blink our eyes, life's rearranged
To our surprise, it's still okay
It's the way things happen
Summer comes, and then it goes
Hold on tight, and brace for cold
And it's only for a moment

[Pre-Chorus]
We've all been down that road before
Searching for that something more

[Chorus]
World's spinning 'round
There's no sign of slowing down
So, won't you take a breath?
Just take a breath
People change and promises are broken
Clouds can move and skies will be wide open
Don't forget to take a breath

[Bridge]
Life isn't suffocating
Air isn't overrated

[Breakdown]
World's spinning 'round
There's no sign of slowing down
So, won't you take a breath?
Just take a breath

[Chorus 2]
World's spinning 'round
There's no sign of slowing down
So, won't you take a breath?
Just take a breath
Take a breath

[Chorus 1]
People change and promises are broken
Clouds can move and skies will be wide open
Don't forget to take a breath

[Chorus 2]
World's spinning 'round
There's no sign of slowing down
So, won't you take a breath?

[Outro]
Don't forget to take a breath
Don't forget to take a breath

[Verse 1]
We sail through endless skies
Stars shine like eyes, the black night sighs
The moon in silver dreams
Pours down in beams, light of the night
The earth, a purple blaze
Of sapphire haze in orbit always

[Verse 2]
While down below the trees
Bathed in cool breeze, silver starlight
Breaks dawn from night
And so, we pass on by
The crimson eye of great God Mars
As we travel the universe

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
What you gonna do?
Time's caught up with you
Now, you wait your turn
You know there's no return
Take your routine roles
You join the other fools
Turn to something new
Now, it's killing you

[Verse 2]
First, it was the bomb
Vietnam, napalm
Disillusioning
You push the needle in
From life, you escape
Reality's black drape
Colours in your mind
Satisfy your time

[Bridge 1]
Oh, you, you know you must be blind
To do such things like this
To take the sweet that you don't know
You're giving Death a kiss
Poor little fool now
Your mind is full of pleasure
Your body's looking ill
To you, it's shallow leisure
So drop the acid pill
Don't stop to think now

[Bridge 2]
You're having a good time, baby, but that won't last
Your mind's all full of things, you're living too fast
Go out, enjoy yourself, don't bottle it in
You need someone to help you, stick the needle in, yeah

[Verse 3]
Now, you know the scene
Your skin starts turning green
Your eyes no longer see
Life's reality
Push the needle in
Face Death's sickly grin
Holes are in your skin
Caused by deadly pin

[Verse 4]
Head starts spinning 'round
You fall down to the ground
Feel your body heave
Death's hand starts to weave
It's too late to turn
You don't wanna learn
Price of life is high
Now, you're gonna die

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse]
Goin' home late last night
Suddenly, I got a fright
Yeah, I looked through a window and surprised what I saw
Fairy with boots are dancin' with a dwarf, alright, now

[Chorus]
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah, I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes, alright, now

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah, I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes, alright, now

[Outro]
So, I went to the doctor, see what he could give me
He said, "Son, son, you've gone too far
'Cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do," yeah

[Verse 1]
Have you ever thought about your soul
Can it be saved?
Or perhaps you think
That when you are dead
You just stay in your grave
Is God just a thought within your head
Or is he a part of you?
Is Christ just a name
That you read in the book
When you were in school?

[Verse 2]
When you think about death
Do you lose your breath
Or do you keep your cool?
Would you like to see the Pope
On the end of a rope?
Do you think he's a fool?
Well, I have seen the truth
Yes, I've seen the light
And I've changed my ways
And I'll be prepared
When you're lonely and scared
At the end of our days

[Bridge]
Could it be you're afraid
Of what your friends might say
If they knew you believe in God above?
They should realise before they criticise
That God is the only way to love

Is your mind so small
That you have to fall
In with the pack wherever they run?
Will you still sneer when death is near
And say that you may as well
Worship the sun?

[Verse 3]
I think it was true it was people like you
That crucified Christ
I think it is sad the opinion you had
Was the only one voiced
Will you be so sure
When your day is near
Say you don't believe?
You had the chance
But you turned it down
Now you can't retrieve

[Outro]
Perhaps you'll think before you say
That God is dead and gone
Open your eyes, just realise
That He is the one
The only one who can save you now
From all this sin and hate
Or will you jeer at all you hear?
Yes, I think it's too late

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas  & Miley Cyrus]
Come on, guys, tell me what we're doing
We're hangin' around when we could be all over the place
The sun is shining just the way we like it
Let's get out of this hallway
Show the world our face

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nick Jonas & Miley Cyrus]
It's Friday, but there's nowhere to go
Anywhere is cool, but we're not going home
And we can do anything we wanna do
It's all up to me and you

[Chorus: Jonas Brothers & Miley Cyrus]
Turn this park into a club
The stars and lights and the moon is the vibe from above
The skateboard, here's our ride
So pull on up, everyone is waiting for us
So anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody knows
We got the party with us
Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody knows
We got the party with us

[Post-Chorus: Jonas Brothers & Miley Cyrus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We got the party with us
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We got the party with us

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas & Miley Cyrus]
Radio, let me be your DJ
I'll turn you up because we're moving 'til we're on a roll
Everyone is dancing to their own beat
And letting go, everybody here's got soul

[Pre-Chorus 2: Nick Jonas]
It's Friday and there's nowhere to be
We're kicking it together, it's so good to be free
We got each other and that's all we need
The rest is up to you and me

[Chorus: Jonas Brothers & Miley Cyrus]
Turn this park into a club
The stars and lights and the moon is the vibe from above
The skateboard, here's our ride
So pull on up, everyone is waiting for us
So anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody knows
We got the party with us
Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody knows
We got the party with us

[Post-Chorus: Nick Jonas & Miley Cyrus]
We got the party with us
We got the party with us
Wo!
We got the party!

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
Life is for dreamers and I'm a believer
That nothing can stand in our way
Today, let's find a place to play

[Chorus: Jonas Brothers & Miley Cyrus]
Turn this park into a club
The stars and lights and the moon is the vibe from above
The skateboard, here's our ride
So pull on up, everyone is waiting for us
Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody knows
We got the party with us
Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody knows
We got the party with us
Turn this park into a club
The stars and lights and the moon is the vibe from above
We got the party with us
Skateboards, heels
So pull on up, everyone is waiting for us
Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody knows
We got the party with us
Anywhere we are
Anywhere we go
Everybody knows
Oh, oh, oh
We got the party, we got the party
We got the party, we got the party with us

[Outro: Jonas Brothers & Miley Cyrus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We got the party with us

[Verse 1]
Revolution in their minds
The children start to march
Against the world
In which they have to live
And all the hate that's in their hearts
They're tired of being pushed around
And told just what to do
They'll fight the world until they've won
And love comes flowing through
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Children of tomorrow live
In the tears that fall today
Will the sunrise of tomorrow
Bring in peace in any way?
Must the world live in the shadow
Of atomic fear?
Can they win the fight for peace
Or will they disappear? Yeah!

[Verse 3]
So you children of the world
Listen to what I say
If you want a better place to live in
Spread the word today
Show the world that love is still alive
You must be brave
Or you children of today
Are children of the grave, yeah!

[Whispered Outro]
Children of the grave
Children of the grave
Children of the grave

[Verse 1]
You're searching for your mind, don't know where to start
Can't find the key to fit the lock on your heart
You think you know, but you are never quite sure
Your soul is ill, but you will not find a cure, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Your world was made for you by someone above
But you choose evil ways instead of love
You made me master of the world where you exist
The soul I took from you was not even missed, yeah!

[Bridge]
Lord of this world
Evil possessor
Lord of this world
He's your confessor now

[Verse 3]
You think you're innocent, you've nothing to fear
You don't know me you say, but isn't it clear?
You turn to me in all your wordly greed and pride
But will you turn to me when it's your turn to die? Yeah!
Beneath the dance hall lights
You seem a girl so sound
Lights up the ground

If you give up New York
I'll give you Tennessee
The only place to be

The cowboy's burning eyes
Don't like the sight of me
Just straight enough to breathe
I like your point of view
So don't you shy away

Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave

Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave
You had me holding of
All the time and place
Ride out the wave
Bury yourself away
The one and only face
Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
It was cloudy on that night
There were no stars in sight
Then the planets all aligned
When I saw her eyes
One look, that's all it took
To send me, to another galaxy
And she said

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
She was on her way to Mars
Then she ran into a star
And she fell into my arms
Thank you gravity

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Never let her go
I'll hide her UFO
She'll never have to know
She's my space girl
And she's out of this world

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
We were watching star wars
She looked kinda bored
Said she'd seen it all before
Made me wonder even more

[Bridge: Joe Jonas]
Which universe was hers?
What galaxy did she call home?
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
She was on her way to Mars
Then she ran into a star
And she fell into my arms
Thank you gravity

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Never let her go
I'll hide her UFO
She'll never have to know
She's my space girl
And she's out of this world

[Bridge 2: Joe and Nick]
She says the moon is overrated
And Jupiter's her favorite and Pluto can't hang (Pluto can't hang)
Like a meteor I'm falling from the first time I saw her
It was heaven on earth (Heaven on earth)

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
She was on her way to Mars
Then she ran into a star
And she fell into my arms

[Chorus 2: Nick Jonas]
Never let her go
I'll hide her UFO
She'll never have to know
Yeah
She was on her way to Mars
Then she ran into a star
And she fell into my arms
Never let her go
I'll hide her UFO
She'll never have to know

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
She's my space girl
And she's out of this world

[Verse 1]
Rocket engines burning fuel so fast
Up into the night sky they blast
Through the universe the engines whine
Could it be the end of man and time?
Back on earth the flame of life burns low
Everywhere is misery and woe
Pollution kills the air, the land and sea
Man prepares to meet his destiny, yeah

[Verse 2]
Rocket engines burning fuel so fast
Up into the black sky so vast
Burning metal through the atmosphere
Earth remains in worry, hate and fear
With the hateful battles raging on
Rockets flying to the glowing sun
Through the empires of eternal void
Freedom from the final suicide

[Bridge]
Freedom fighters sent out to the sun
Escape from brainwashed minds and pollution
Leave the earth to all its sin and hate
Find another world where freedom waits, yeah

[Verse 3]
Past the stars in fields of ancient void
Through the shields of darkness where they find
Love upon a land a world unknown
Where the sons of freedom make their home
Leave the earth to Satan and his slaves
Leave them to their future in their grave
Make a home where love is there to stay
Peace and happiness in every day

[Verse 1]
Long ago I wandered through my mind
In the land of fairy tales and stories
Lost in happiness I knew no fears
Innocence and love was all I knew
It was an illusion

[Verse 2]
Soon the days were passing into years
Happiness just didn't come so easy
Life was more than fairy tales and daydreams
Innocence was just another word
It was an illusion

[Bridge]
Lost in the wheels of confusion
Running through valleys of tears
Eyes full of angry delusion
Hiding in everyday fears

[Verse 3]
So I found that life is just a game
But you know there's never been a winner
Try your hardest, you'll still be a loser
The world will still be turning when you're gone
Yeah, when you're gone

[Instrumental: The Straightener]

[Intro]
(Oh, Oh! Oh, Oh! Oh, Oh!)
(Oh, Oh! Oh, Oh! Oh, Oh!)

[Verse 2: Joe]
Calling you out, calling you out
So you can see what's going on
Breaking it down, breaking me down
'Cause I can see that something's wrong

[Pre-Chorus: Nick]
Your body's moving
But your mind is somewhere else
And I don't know how to get there
It's like you're losing yourself

[Chorus: Nick]
(Oh, oh)
No, I never thought that we'd come this far
(Oh, oh!)
Got enough for me to break my heart
(Oh, oh)
When the music stops
Promise me that you won't let it go
We'll keep dancing 'till tomorrow

[Verse 2: Joe]
Calling you out, calling you out
'Cause I can see we're near the end
Letting me down, letting me down
It's like we're back to one again

[Pre-Chorus: Nick]
Your body's moving
But your mind is somewhere else
And I don't know how to get there
It's like you're losing yourself

[Chorus: Nick]
(Oh, oh)
No, I never thought we'd come this far
(Oh, oh!)
Got enough for me to break my heart
(Oh, oh)
When the music stops
Promise me that you won't let it go
We'll keep dancing 'til tomorrow

[Bridge: Nick]
(Oh, oh!), no we're not gonna stop when they hit the lights
(Oh, oh!), when the rest is wrong you're the one thing right
(Oh, oh!), when the music stops promise me that you won't let it go
We'll keep dancing 'til tomorrow, yeah, hey, oh (Oh!)

[Chorus: Nick]
(Oh, oh)
No, I never thought we'd come this far
(Oh, oh!)
Got enough for me to break my heart
(Oh, oh)
When the music stops
Promise me that you won't let it go
Keep dancing 'til tomorrow
(Oh, oh)
No, we're not gonna stop when they hit the lights
(Oh, oh!)
When the rhythm is gone, do the one thing right
(Oh, oh)
When the music stops, promise me that you won't let it go
We'll keep dancing 'til tomorrow

[Outro: Nick]
Keep dancing 'til tomorrow
(Oh, oh)
No, we're not gonna stop
When they hit the lights
(Oh, oh!)
When the rest is wrong you're the one thing right
(Oh, oh)
When the music stops
Promise me that you won't let it go
We'll keep dancing 'til tomorrow

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm leaving tomorrow at daybreak
Catch the fastest train around nine
Yes, I'm leaving the sorrow and heartaches
Before it takes me away from my mind

[Verse 2]
Send me love, and I may let you see me
Send me hopes I can fit in my head
But if you really want me to answer
I can only let you know when I'm dead

[Bridge]
When sadness fills my days
It's time to turn away
And then tomorrow's dreams
Become reality to me

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
So realise I'm much better without you
You're not the one and only thing in my heart
I'll just go back to pretending I'm living
So this time I'm gonna have the star part

[Verse 1]
I wanna reach out and touch the sky
I wanna touch the sun, but I don't need to fly
I'm gonna climb up every mountain of the moon
And find the dish that ran away with the spoon

[Verse 2]
I've crossed the oceans, turned every bend
I found the plastic and the golden rainbow's end
I've been through magic and through life's reality
I've lived a thousand years, it never bothered me

[Guitar Solo]

[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 3]
Got no religion, don't need no friends
Got all I want and I don't need to pretend
Don't try to reach me, 'cause I'll tear up your mind
I've seen the future and I've left it behind

[Verse 1]
What you get and what you see
Things that don’t come easily
Feeling happy in my pain
Icicles within my brain (Cocaine)

[Verse 2]
Something blowing in my head
Winds of ice that soon will spread
Down to freeze my very soul
Makes me happy, makes me cold

[Chorus]
My eyes are blind, but I can see
The snowflakes glisten on the trees
The sun no longer sets me free
I feel the snowflakes freezing me

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Let the winter sun shine on
Let me feel the frost of dawn
Build my dreams on flakes of snow
Soon I’ll feel the chilling glow

[Bridge]
Right!
Don’t you think I know what I’m doing
Don’t tell me that it’s doing me wrong
You’re the one that’s really the loser
This is where I feel I belong
Right!

[Verse 4]
Crystal world with winter flowers
Turn my days to frozen hours
Lying snowblind in the sun
Will my ice age ever come?

[Instrumental outro]

[Verse 1]
Too much near the truth they say
Keep it till another day
Let them have their little game
Delusion helps to keep them sane

[Verse 2]
Let them have their little toys
Matchbox cars and mortgaged joys
Exciting in their plastic ways
Frozen food in a concrete maze

[Chorus]
You’re gonna go insane
I’m trying to save your brain

[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 3]
All right!
I don’t know what’s happening
My head’s all torn inside
People say I’m heavy
They don’t know what I hide

[Verse 4]
Take a life, it’s going cheap
Kill someone, no one will weep
Freedom’s yours, just pay your dues
We just want your soul to use

[Chorus]
You’re gonna go insane
I’m trying to save your brain

[Verse 1]
Well, I don’t want no Jesus freak to tell me what it’s all about
No black magician telling me to cast my soul out
Don’t believe in violence, I don’t even believe in peace
I’ve opened the door, now my mind has been released

[Verse 2]
Well, I don’t want no preacher telling me about the god in the sky
No, I don’t want no one to tell me where I’m gonna go when I die
I wanna live my life, I don’t want people telling me what to do
I just believe in myself ’cause no one else is true

[Bridge: "Every Day Comes and Goes"]
Every day just comes and goes
Life is one long overdose
People try to rule the nation
I just see through their frustration

People hiding their real face
Keep on running their rat race
Behind each flower there grows a weed
In their world of make-believe

[Verse 3]
So believe what I tell you, it’s the only way to fight in the end
Just believe in yourself, you know you really shouldn’t have to pretend
Don’t let those empty people try to interfere with your mind
Just live your life and leave them all behind

[Verse 1]
You've seen right through distorted eyes, you know you had to learn
The execution of your mind, you really had to turn
The race is run, the book is read, the end begins to show
The truth is out, the lies are old, but you don't want to know

[Chorus]
Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies

[Verse 2]
The people who have crippled you, you wanna see them burn
The gates of life have closed on you, and there's just no return
You're wishing that the hands of doom could take your mind away
And you don't care if you don't see again the light of day

[Chorus]
Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies, you bastards!

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Where can you run to? What more can you do?
No more tomorrow, life is killing you
Dreams turn to nightmares, heaven turns to Hell
Burnt out confusion, nothing more to tell, yeah
Everything around you, what's it coming to?
God knows as your dog nose, bog, blast all of you
Sabbath bloody sabbath, nothing more to do
Living just for dying, dying just for you, yeah

[Verse 1]
I wrote this lyric for you
All by myself
What makes you think I need you
Or anybody else
But when you see me walking
Just staring at my feet
Cause I'm not all about you
I'm already complete

[Verse 2]
Hope this doesn't make you cry
But I don't wanna make you mine
I told you for the millionth time
That I don't need you in my life

[Chorus]
But you can see through me (yeah)
How you get to me
You know I'm just a fraud
I'm just afraid
I feel the same
But don't tell anyone
Don't tell anyone

[Verse 3]
I wake up thinking of you
And that weirds me out
I try hard not to call you
But I can't do without
Hearing your voice tell me
That I am on your mind
It wouldn't work to rush this
I'll come around in time

[Verse 4]
I hope that you can understand
Right now I don't know where I stand
I'd rather hide behind these walls
Pretending I don't care at all

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Life keeps going on
The world keep spinning round
Can't we stop going in circles
Am I afraid of what they'll say
Or too confused to see
You and me

[Chorus]
But you can see through me (yeah)
How you get to me
You know I'm just a fraud (I'm just afraid)
I'm just afraid
I feel the same
But don't tell anyone
Don't tell anyone

[Chorus]
But you can see through me (You can see through me)
How you get to me (How you get to me)
You know I'm just a fraud
I'm just afraid
I feel the same
But don't tell anyone
Don't tell anyone

[Verse 1]
I am the world that hides the universal secret of all time
Destruction of the empty spaces is my one and only crime
I've lived a thousand times, I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images, the unborn child that never was conceived

[Verse 2]
When little worlds collide, I'm trapped inside my embryonic cell
And flashing memories are cast into the never-ending well
The name that scorns the face, the child that never sees the cause of man
The deathly darkness that belies the fate of those who never ran

[Verse 3]
You gotta believe, yeah, I'm talking to you
Well, I know it's hard for you to know the reason why
And I know you'll understand more when it's time to die
Don't believe the life you have will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep to let your soul live on

[Verse 4]
I want you to listen, I'm trying to get through
Love has given life to you and now it's your concern
Unseen eye of inner life will make your soul return
Still, I look, but not to touch the seeds of life are sown
Curtain of the future falls, the secret stays unknown

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
Just remember love is life and hate is living death
Treat your life for what it's worth and live for every breath
Looking back I've lived and learned, but now, I'm wondering
Here, I wait and only guess what this next life will bring, haha!

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Feel so good, I feel so fine
Love that little lady, always on my mind
She gives me loving every night and day
Never gonna leave her, never going away

[Chorus 1]
Someone to love me
You know she makes me feel alright!
Someone to need me
Love me every single night!

[Verse 2]
Feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love it's something out of this world
Feels so good to know that she's all mine
Going to love that woman till the end of time

[Chorus]
Someone to live for
Love me till the end of time!
Makes me feel happy
Good to know that she's all mine

[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 3]
Lovely lady, make love all night long
Ooh, lovely lady, never do me wrong
Uh, I don’t wanna leave ya
I never wanna leave ya

[Bridge]
Anymore
No more

[Verse 4]
Lovely lady, mystifying eyes
Lovely lady, she don’t tell me no lies
I know I’ll never leave ya
I’m never gonna leave you

[Outro]
Anymore
I said no more, I said no more!
Ooh, alright, yeah! Alright now, yeah
No more, yeah! I said, little woman, no more
I said, little woman, no more, I said no more
Ooh, yeah! Come on, now, baby

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Well, people look and people stare
Well, I don’t think that I even care
You work your life away and what do they give?
You're only killing yourself to live

[Chorus]
Killing yourself to live
Killing yourself to live

[Verse 2]
Just take a look around you, what do you see?
Pain, suffering, and misery
It's not the way that the world was meant
It's a pity, you don't understand

[Chorus]
Killing yourself to live
Killing yourself to live

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
I'm telling you, believe in me, nobody else will tell you
Open your eyes and see the lies, oh yeah
(Smoke it, get high)
You think that I'm crazy and, baby, I know that it's true
Before that you know it I think that you'll go crazy too

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
I don't know if I'm up or down
Whether black is white or blue is brown
The colors of my life are all different somehow
Little boy blue's a big girl now
So you think it's me who's strange
But you've never had to make the change
Never give your trust away
You'll end up paying till your dying day

[Verse 1]
Yes, I know the secret
That’s within your mind
You think all the people
Who worship you are blind
You’re just like Big Brother
Giving us your trust
And when you have played enough
You’ll just cast our souls

[Chorus]
Into the dust
Into the dust

[Verse 2]
You thought that it would be easy
From the very start
Now I’ve found you out
I don’t think you’re so smart
I only have one more question
Before my time is through
Please, I beg you, tell me
In the name of hell

[Chorus]
Who are you?
Who are you?

[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 2]
You thought that it would be easy
From the very start
Now I’ve found you out
I don’t think you’re so smart
I only have one more question
Before my time is through
Please I beg you tell me
In the name of hell

[Chorus]
Who are you?
Who are you?

[Verse 1]
It’s complete, but obsolete
All tomorrows become yesterday
In demand, but second-hand
It’s been heard before you even play, yeah
Up to date, but came too late
Better get yourself another name
You’re so right, but overnight
You’re the one who has to take the blame, yeah

[Chorus]
Everyone just gets on top of you
The pain begins to eat your pride
You can’t believe in anything you knew
When was the last time that you cried?
Yeah-ay-ay-ay, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Don’t delay, you’re in today
But tomorrow is another dream
Sunday’s star is Monday’s scar
Out of date before you’re even seen, yeah
At the top so quick to flop
You’re so new, but rotting in decay
Like butterfly, so quick to die
But you’re only looking for today, yeah

[Chorus]
Everyone just gets on top of you
The pain begins to eat your pride
You can’t believe in anything you knew
When was the last time that you cried?
Yeah-ay-ay-ay, yeah!

[Refrain]
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today

[Verse 3]
Listen!
Glamour trip so soon to slip
Easy come but, oh, how quick it goes
Ten foot tall, but what a fall
Hard to open, yet so easy to close, yeah
Front page news but so abused
You just want to hide yourself away
Overpaid, but soon you fade
Because you’re only looking for today, yeah

[Refrain]
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today

[Intro]
Looking at a picture of you in my hands
Wondering if I'm ever gonna see you again

[Chorus]
Without you I don't know how my life will be
But I believe
It's not goodbye
Cause I will remember you
And I will see you again
When I rise
Cause I know and I believe
I will see you in eternity

[Verse 1]
So close yet so far
But in my heart you're here with me
You did not leave
You just went to live in eternity

[Chorus]

You will live in the light of the sun again
Dancing in the river of life and
Knowing that'll never end and forever by my side
I'll never have to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Cause I will remember you
And I will see you again
When I rise
Cause I know and I believe
I will see you in eternity

[Verse 3]
It's not goodbye
Cause I will remember you
And I will see you again
When I rise
Cause I know and I believe
I will see you in eternity
I will see you in eternity

[Verse 1]
Sorcerers of madness selling me their time
Child of God sitting in the sun, giving peace of mind
Fictional seduction on a black-snow sky
Sadness kills the superman, even fathers cry

[Chorus]
Of all the things I value most of all
I look inside myself and see
My world and know that it is good
You know that I should

[Verse 2]
Superstitious century, didn’t time go slow
Separating sanity, watching children grow
Synchronated undertaker, spiral skies
Silver ships on plasmic oceans in disguise

[Chorus]
Of all the things I value most in life
I see my memories and feel their warmth
And know that they are good
You know that I should

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Watching eyes of celluloid tell you how to live
Metaphoric motor-replay, give, give, give!
Laughter kissing love is showing me the way
Spiral city architect, I build, you pay

[Chorus]
Of all the things I value most of all
I look upon my earth and feel the warmth
And know that it is good
You know that I should
You know that I should
You know that I should
You know that I should

[Verse 1]
This Christmas time there's just one thing I want
It top's it all, it's better than eggnog
It's cold outside, my boots are full of snow
I'm just hoping for some Mistle toe

Oh

[Chorus]
You can take these presents, underneath my tree
You can take this awesome scarf my grandma made for me
You can take these boxes, tied up with string
Cause all I want for Christmas is the girl of my dreams

Yeah

Woah

Ho, Ho, Ho, Ho, Ho!!!

Yeah

[Verse 2]
Light's are going up it's Christmas time
But I just want that girl to be mine
My stocking's full but I'm not satisfied
No, No, No, No
But I'll just wait until she's by my side

Yeah

[Chorus]
You can take these presents, underneath my tree
You can take this awesome scarf my grandma made for me
You can take these boxes, tied up with string
Cause all I want for Christmas is the girl of my dreams

Falalalala, lalalala

Faaaa la la laaa

[Chorus]

[x2]
You can take these presents, underneath my tree
You can take this awesome scarf my grandma made for me
I would give it all, just to let you see
That all I want for Christmas is the girl of my dreams

[Verse 1]
I’m looking through a hole in the sky
I’m seeing nowhere through the eyes of a lie
I’m getting closer to the end of the line
I’m living easy where the sun doesn’t shine

[Verse 2]
I’m living in a room without any view
I’m living free because the rent’s never due
The synonym of all the things that I’ve said
Are just the riddles that are built in my head

[Chorus]
Hole in the sky
Gateway to Heaven
Window in time
Through it, I’ll fly

[Verse 3]
I’ve seen the stars that disappear in the sun
But shooting’s easy if you’ve got the right gun
And even though I’m sitting waiting for Mars
I don’t believe there’s any future in cars

[Chorus]
Hole in the sky
Gateway to Heaven
Window in time
Through it, I’ll fly
Yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
I’ve watched the dogs of war enjoying their feast
I’ve seen the western world go down in the east
The food of love became the greed of our time
And now we’re living on the profits of crime

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Every time I think I'm closer to the heart
What it means to know just who I am
I think I finally found a better place to start
No one ever seems to understand
I need to try to get to where you are
Could it be you're not that far?

[Chorus]
You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singing
I need to find you
Gotta find you
You're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me
I need to find you
I gotta find you
Oh yeah
Yeah

[Verse 2]
You're the remedy I'm searching hard to find
To fix the puzzle that I see inside
Painting all my dreams the color of your smile
When I find you it will be alright
I need to try to get to where you are
Could it be you're not that far?

[Chorus]
You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singing
I need to find you
Gotta find you
You're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me
I need to find you
Gotta find you

[Verse 3]
Been feeling lost
Can't find the words to say
Spending all my time stuck in yesterday
Where you are is where I wanna be
Next to you, you next to me
Oh
I need to find you
Yeah

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

[SHANE]
Oh!
Yeah
Alright
Mmm-hmm

Gather 'round, guys, it's time to start listenin'
Practice makes perfect, but perfect's not workin'
There's a lot more to music
Than knowing where your cue's gonna be
You can play all the right notes
But that don't mean you're movin' me

[SHANE/JASON/NATE]
But if you can jump like David Lee Roth
Or pump your fist like you're Bruce the Boss

[SHANE]
If you got heart and soul

[SHANE/JASON/NATE]
You can rock 'n' roll

[SHANE]
Rock 'n' roll

[SHANE/JASON/NATE]
Strum it, drum it, slide across and run it
The stage is your home if you learn how to own it
Like the greats did
There's no way that you can fake it
You've gotta feel the beat before you can move
Even though you're not wearin' blue suede shoes
And makin' mistakes, well, that won't matter
If you can swagger like ol' Mick Jagger

[NATE]
If you've got heart and soul
You can rock 'n' roll
You can rock 'n' roll

(spoken)
Woo, solo

[Guitar Solo]

[SHANE/JASON/NATE]
If you live and you die for the music inside
If the one-four-five never gets old
Then you can rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll

[SHANE, spoken]
Alright, now, take it low
Now, I need the spotlight to hit me right here
As the crowd starts to cheer
I need the fan to blow right through my rockstar hair
Right here

[NATE]
If you can scream like Axl Rose
Or sing like Christina show after show
If you've got heart and soul
You can rock 'n' roll, yeah

[SHANE]
If you've got heart and soul
You can rock 'n' roll

[NATE, SHANE]
You can rock 'n' roll
Ooh, yeah
Ooh-ooh (Rock 'n' roll), yeah
You can rock 'n' roll

[Verse 1]
Isn't it strange
Ain't it a shame
People walking down Broadway
Begging for change
We just walk by
Don't hear that they're crying
We just keep on typing on our two ways
Oblivious to other people's pain

[Bridge]
Gotta open up our eyes
Gotta read between the lines
Gotta listen to the sound

[Chorus]
Cause this is life
It's harder than it looks
You never get enough
The time
Keeps flying
In life
You only get one shot
So give thanks for what you've got right now
Don't you worry
Hey we're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright
Gonna be alright yea
Woo
Hey hey hey

[Verse 2]
You feel so alone
Your problems at home
They always seem to follow you wherever you go
Caught in a daze
You wish you could change
But you always tell yourself
That hopes seems a million miles aways

[Bridge]
Gotta wake up from your sleep
Gotta stay awake to dream
Gotta open your heart and believe
Oh

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
One two three yea
It's a roller coaster life
Up and down and side to side
Just shout to get it right

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Take me through the centuries to supersonic years
Electrifying enemy is drowning in his tears
All I have to give you is a love that never dies
The symptom of the universe is written in your eyes
Yeah! Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Mother Moon, she’s calling me back to her silver womb
Father of creation takes me from my stolen tomb
Seventh Advent unicorn is waiting in the skies
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies
Yeah! Yeah!

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Verse 3]
Take my hand, my child of love, come step inside my tears
Swim the magic ocean I’ve been crying all these years
With our love, we’ll ride away into eternal skies
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies
Yeah! Yeah!

[Guitar Solo 2]

[Outro]
Woman child of love’s creation
Come and step inside my dreams
In your eyes, I see no sadness
You are all that loving means
Take my hand, and we’ll go riding
Through the sunshine from above
We’ll find happiness together
In the summer skies of love

[Verse 1]
(I hide–I hide–I hide–)
I hide myself inside the shadows of shame
The silent symphonies were playing their game
My body echoed to the dreams of my soul
It started something that I could not control
Where can I run to now, the joke is on me
No sympathizing God, it’s insanity, yeah

[Refrain]
Why don't you just get out of my life, yeah?
Why don't you just get out of my life, now?
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone, now?
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone, yeah?

[Verse 2]
(Obsessed–obsessed–obsessed–)
Obsessed with fantasy, possessed with my schemes
I mixed reality with pseudo-God dreams
The ghost of violence was something I’d seen
I sold my soul to be the human obscene
How could this poison be the dream of my soul?
How did my fantasies take complete control, yeah?

[Refrain]
Why don't you just get out of my life, yeah?
Why don't you just get out of my life, now?
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone, now?
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone, yeah?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Well, I feel something’s taking me I don’t know where
It’s like a trip inside a separate mind
The ghost of tomorrow from my favourite dream
Is telling me to leave it all behind
Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow
Gotta get to happiness, want no more of sorrow

[Chorus]
Realised when to hide
How I tried to get away from you, now
Now am I right if I fight
That I might just get away from you, now
Sting me!

[Verse 4]
Well, I feel something’s giving me the chance to return
It’s giving me the chance of saving my soul
Pictures of demigod are fading away
I’m going backward, but I’m in control
Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow
Getting back to sanity, providence of sorrow

[Chorus]
Was it wise to disguise
How I tried to get away from you, now?
Is there a way that I can pay
Or is it true I have to stay with you, now?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
How I lied, went to hide
How I tried to get away from you now
Am I right in my fight
That I might just get away from you now
Suck me!

[Verse 5]
I’m really digging schizophrenia, the best of the earth
I’ll chase my soul in the fires of hell
Peace of mind eluded me, but now it’s all mine
I simply try, but he wants me to fail
Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow
Now I’ve found my happiness, from the depths of sorrow

[Chorus]
No more lies, I got wise
I despise the way I worshiped you
Now I’m free, let me see
That now instead, I won’t be led by you, now
Free!

[Instrumental Outro]

[Chorus]
Joy to the world! The Lord is come!
Let earth receive her King!
Let every heart prepare him room!
Let heaven and nature sing
Let heaven and nature sing
Let heaven and nature sing

[Verse 1]
We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts we travel so far
Field and fountain, moor and mountain
Following yonder star

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Born a king on Bethlehem's plain
Gold I bring to crown Him again
King forever, ceasing never
(Whoa!)

[Chorus]
Joy to the world! The Lord is come!
Let earth receive her King!
Let every heart prepare him room!
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
Let heaven, heaven and nature heaven and nature sing
(Oh! Oh Oh!)

[Verse 1]
Now I'm the king of the swingers
Oh, the jungle VIP
I've reached the top and had to stop
And that's what botherin' me
I wanna be a man, mancub
And stroll right into town
And be just like the other men
I'm tired of monkeyin' around!

[Chorus]
Oh, oobee do
I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you
Talk like you, too
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be human too

[Verse 2]
Now don't try to kid me, mancub
I made a deal with you
What I desire is man's red fire
To make my dream come true
Give me the secret, mancub
Clue me what to do
Give me the power of man's red flower
So I can be like you

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
Oh, oobee do
I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you
Talk like you, too
Oh, oobee do
I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you
Talk like you, too
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be human too

[Verse 1]
Let's go

Don't want you for a night
I'm only interested if I can have you for life, yeah
I know I sound serious
Well baby I am
You're a fine piece of real-estate and I'm gonna get Me some land oh

[Chorus]
Don't try to rush, honey love can be fun
There's no need to be in love when you'll find that someone

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
She's got a smile
That I’d die for
Everyone knows, that I’m
A prisoner of war, for her
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I wish
I had a kung fu grip
Never let her slip
Away she'd be my girl

[Chorus]
I Really wish she knew
What I feel is true
She'd be my darling
I would be her hero too

[Verse 2]
I’m so in love
With her
Don’t care who knows
That I’m
Ready to fight, ready to go
Just like a G.I. Joe

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I wish
I had a kung fu grip
Never let her slip
Away she'd be my girl

[Chorus]
I Really wish she knew
What I feel is true
She'd be my darling
I would be her hero too

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I wish
I had a kung fu grip
Never let her slip
Away she'd be my girl

[Chorus]
I Really wish she knew
What I feel is true
She'd be my darling
I would be her hero too

[Outro]
She'd be my darling
I would be her hero too. 

[x3]

[Verse 1]
It's a long way to nowhere
And I'm leaving very soon
On the way we pass so close
To the back side of the moon

[Refrain]
Hey, join the traveler
If you've got nowhere to go
Hang your head and take my hand
It's the only road I know

[Chorus]
Oh, lonely is the word, yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
I've been higher than stardust
I've been seen upon the sun
I used to count in millions then
But now I only count in one

[Refrain]
C'mon, join the traveler
If you've got nowhere to go
Hang your head and take my hand
It's the only road I know

[Chorus]
Yeah, lonely is the word
Got to be the saddest song I've ever heard

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Yeah, lonely is the name
Maybe life's a losing game

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
In your mind, you can see it
Running towards the light
You're so close, You can feel it
Don't look back this time
Turn around, think about where you are now
Fill it up, turn it up, I wanna hear it loud
Once we start, there's no way we can slow down

[Chorus]
So lets go
Living like it's now or never
Give them something to remember
If you're with me let me know, know, know
So lets go oh, oh, oh
So lets go oh, oh, oh
So lets go oh, oh, oh
So lets go oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Feel the floor, as its shaking (as its shaking)
The walls are gonna fall
Feel the rules, that were breaking (that were breaking)
We're gonna shatter them all
Turn around, think about where you are now
Fill it up, turn it up, I wanna hear it loud
Once we start there is no way we can slow down

[Chorus]
So lets go
Living like it's now or never
Give them something to remember
If you're with me let me know, know, know
So lets go oh, oh, oh
So lets go oh, oh, oh
So lets go oh, oh, oh
So lets go oh, oh, oh

[Hook:]
So lets go
So lets go
So lets go
So lets go
So lets go
So lets go
So lets go

[Chorus]
So lets go
Living like it's now or never
Give them something to remember
If your with me let me know, know, know
So lets go oh, oh, oh
So lets go oh, oh, oh
So lets go oh, oh, oh
So lets go oh, oh, oh

[Outro:]
So lets go oh, oh, oh
So lets go oh, oh, oh
So lets go oh, oh, oh
So lets go oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Wouldn't it be nice if I had some tissues
Wipe away the tears that's right you got issues
Why do you keep asking questions when I don't care
And how many times will it take you to figure out
How much I hate you
I'm right, your wrong, move on

[Chorus]
Cause you love me
And I hate you
I'm right
You're wrong
Move on

[Pre-Chorus]
Wouldn't it be nice if you stopped whining
And telling all your friends that I've been lying
You can trust me when I tell you we're through (we're through)
And how many times will it take you
Do the math me minus you
I'm right, your wrong, move on

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
How many feelings will you harbor
Get over it your friends are so much hotter (oh yeah)
I'm right, your wrong, move on
I'm right, your wrong, move on

[Chorus]

[x2]
Cause you love me
And I hate you
I'm right
You're wrong
Move on

[Verse 1]
I admit that in the past I've been a nasty
They weren't kidding when they called me kinda strange
But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways
Repented, seen the light, and made a change
And I fortunately know a little secret
It's a talent that I always have possessed
And dear lady, please don't laugh
I use it on behalf
Of the miserable, the lonely, and depressed (pathetic)

[Chorus]
Poor unfortunate souls
In pain
In need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them?
Yes, indeed!
Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad
So true
They come flocking to me crying
"Will you help us, pretty please?"
And I help them!
Yes I do!

[Verse 2]
The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
They think a girl who gossips is a bore!
Yes on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word
And after all dear, what is idle prattle for?
They're not all that impressed with conversation
True gentlemen avoid it when they can
But they dote and swoon and fawn
On ladies who withdrawn
It's she who holds her tongue who gets a man

[Chorus]
Poor unfortunate souls
Go ahead!
Make your choice!
I'm a very busy person and I haven't got all day
It won't cost much
Just your voice!
Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad
So true
If you wanna cross the bridge, my sweet
You've got the pay the toll
Take a gulp
Take a breath
Go ahead
Sign the scroll
Nick and Kevin
Now I've got her, boys
The boss is on a roll
You poor unfortunate souls

[Verse 3]
In pain
In need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them?
Yes, indeed!
Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad
So true
They come flocking to me crying
"Will you help us, pretty please?"
And I help them!
Yes I do!

[Outro]
Those poor unfortunate souls

[Verse 1]
Rewind July last summer
I saw Santa Jumping through my sprinkler
Rudolph, Jack Frost, & Reindeer
Opened up a lemonade stand on my corner
2 cups for a dollar

[Chorus]
Open up your eyes
Crazy summertime
No words you'll find
Upside down the weather man says snow
But its burning up outside
Its always summertime

[Verse 2]
Push play
Today, I saw my girlfriend
At the beach, putting sunscreen on a penguin
Just when I thought it couldn't get weirder
I saw the grinch at the boardwalk with my teacher

[Chorus]


Always summertime
Always summertime

[Verse 3]
My teachers with the Grinch
Crazy summertime
And saint nick is getting drenched
Always summertime
And now Rudolph's getting hitched
Crazy summertime


All elves are in Hawaii

[Chorus]
Open up your eyes
Crazy summertime
No words you'll find
Upside down the weather man says snow
But it's burning up outside
Its always summertime
Open up your eyes
Crazy summertime
No words you'll find
Upside down the weather man says snow
But it's burning up outside
Its always summertime

[Verse 1]
Talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Aisling away
I'll be coming for your love, OK?

[Chorus]
Take on me, take on me
Take me on, take on me
I'll be gone in a day or two

[Verse 2]
Needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But that's me stumbling away
Slowly learning life is OK
Repeat after me
It's so much better to be safe than sorry

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
Take on me, take on me
Take me on, take on me
I'll be gone in a day or two
In a day or two
In a day or two

[Verse 1]
Everybody’s looking at me
Feeling paranoid inside
When I step outside, I’ll feel free
Think I’ll find a place to hide

[Chorus]
Tell me, people
Am I going insane—insane?
Tell me, people
Am I going insane—insane?

[Verse 2]
Every day, I sit and wonder
How my life it used to be
Now, I feel like going under
Now, my life is hard to see

[Chorus]
So, tell me, people
Am I going insane—insane?
Tell me, people
Am I going insane—insane?

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
So, I’m telling all you people
Listen while I sing again
If I don’t sound very cheerful
I think that I’m a schizophrene

[Chorus]
So, tell me, people
Am I going insane—insane?
Tell me, people
Am I going insane—insane?
Tell me, people
Am I going insane—insane?
Tell me, people
Am I going insane—insane?

[Verse 1]
Pardon my interruption
This drink's just settling in
All my reservations
A reason I don't exist
She says, "Can you keep a secret
A ceremony set for June
I know it's a rush but I just love him so much
I hope that you can meet him soon."

[Chorus]
No, I don't wanna love
If it's not you
I don't wanna hear the wedding bells prove
That we can't try
One last time
But I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime!
Trying to fall asleep
You wake me up cause I'm trying to see the light
Instead of you in white
No I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime
The wedding bells, wedding bells, wedding bells

[Verse 2]
Pardon my harsh reaction
You put me on the spot
And if I'm being honest
I'm hoping that I'd get caught
Showing you I'm unhappy
Letting you see my truth
Cause if you recall our anniversary falls
11 nights into June

[Chorus]
No, I don't wanna love
If it's not you
I don't wanna hear the wedding bells prove
That we can't try
One last time
But I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime!
Trying to fall asleep
You wake me up cause I'm trying to see the light
Instead of you in white
No I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime
The wedding bells

[Bridge:]
Ah ah ah ah ah
The wedding bells
The wedding bells

[Chorus]
No, I don't wanna love
If it's not you
I don't wanna hear the wedding bells prove
That we can't try
One last time
But I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime!
Trying to fall asleep
You wake me up cause I'm trying to see the light
Instead of you in white
No I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime
The wedding bells
The wedding bells

[Verse 1]
Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me
We pillage plunder, we rifle and loot
Stand up me hearties, yo ho
We kidnap and ravage and don't give a hoot
Stand up me hearties, yo ho

[Verse 2]
Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me
We extort and pilfer, we filch and sack
Stand up me hearties, yo ho
Maraud and embezzle and even hijack
Stand up me hearties, yo ho

[Verse 3]
Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me
We kindle and char and in flame and ignite
Stand up me hearties, yo ho
We burn up the city, we're really a fright
Stand up me hearties, yo ho

[Bridge]
We're rascals and scoundrels, we're villains and knaves
Stand up me hearties, yo ho
We're jokers and black sheep, we're really bad eggs
Stand up me hearties, yo ho

[Verse 4]
We're beggars and blighters and ne'er do-well cads
Stand up me hearties, yo ho
Aye, but we're loved by our mommies and dads
Stand up me hearties, yo ho
Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me

[Verse 1]
The way I feel is the way I am
I wish I'd walked before I started to run to you
Just to you
What kind of people do you think we are?
Another joker who's a rock and roll star for you
Just for you
The faithful image of another man
The endless ocean of emotion I swam for you
Yeah, for you
The shock troopers laying down on the floor
I wish they’d fallen into my private war with you
Yeah, with you
Are you metal, are you man?
You've changed a lot since you began
Yeah, began
Ladies digging gold from you
Will they still dig now you're through?
Yeah, you're through

[Verse 2]
You bought and sold me with your lying words
The voices in the dark that you never heard came through
Yeah, came through
Your fallen phallic god dismembered and gone
A poisoned father with his poisonous son, that's you
Yeah, that's you
I beg you, please don't let it get any worse
The anger I once had has turned to a curse on you
Yeah, curse you
All of the promises that never came true
You're gonna get what is coming to you, that's true
Ah, that's true
Are you Satan, are you man?
You've changed a lot since it began
It began
Vultures sucking gold from you
Will they still suck now you're through?

[Bridge]
(Cats, rats)
The search is on, so you just better run
And find yourself another way
Rob the dead, they don't feel a thing
Leave the living for another day
(Rats, rat)
You are a nonentity, you have no destiny
You are a figment of a thing unknown
A mantle picture of a stolen soul
A fornication of your golden throne

[Chorus]
A smiling face, it means the world to me
So tired of sadness and of misery, yeah!

[Interlude]
My life, it started some time ago
Where it will end, I don't know
I thought I was so good
I thought I was smart
I feel my world being torn apart

[Chorus]
But everything is gonna work out fine
If it don't, I think I'll lose my mind, yeah!

[Interlude]
I know, I know
I know, yeah, yeah, I know
Listen to me while I sing this song
You might just think the words are wrong
Too many people advising me
But they don't know what my eyes see

[Chorus]
But everything is gonna work out fine, yeah
If it don't, I feel I'll blow my mind, yeah!

[Instrumental Outro]

[verse]
Blow on a jug
Everybody come on, blow on a jug
Be like me and blow on a jug
I want you to blow on a jug
Everybody begin, blow on a jug tonight
You are blowin' on a jug

[?]

[Verse 1]
I met you in a dream
And your piercing eyes were staring straight at me
I can't believe this feeling
You make me feel so much
I want you always near me
Is this really what it seems?

[Pre-Chorus]
What you, what you're feeling
Let me know it immediately
And surely, surely I will
Understand you (more and more)
I'm beginning to get confused (more and more)
It's, it's suffocating (more and more)
Come on here

[Chorus]
I need you
I want you
I got to have you
It's infatuation

[Verse 2]
Love, I've finally found a new
And it came to me inside your vision
Now I know I need you so
You make me feel like crazy
I really feel you, baby
I see an angel in your eyes
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
What you, what you're feeling
Let me know it immediately
And surely, surely I will
Understand you (more and more)
I'm beginning to get confused (more and more)
It's, it's suffocating (more and more)
Come on here

[Chorus]
I need you
I want you
I got to have you
It's infatuation

[Bridge]
If fire falls down from the sky
If all the rivers should run dry
If false turns out to be true
You know that I will find you
Because our love is destiny
Baby, baby

[Breakdown]
What you, what you're feeling
Let me know it immediately
And surely, surely I will
Understand you (more and more)
I'm beginning to get confused (more and more)
It's, it's suffocating (more and more)
Come on here

[Chorus]
I need you
I want you
I've got to have you

[Outro]
It's infatuation
You're my love, frustration
You're my love, frustration
You're my love, frustration
You're my love, frustration
LA is a bubble, one large iridescent bubble.. soap and ocean water. floating. at least it lets the planes out. & only the ears pop, never the bubble. after you leave a while you’ll miss it. although, you can really miss the worst things.. a cigarette, a doomed bus. easy tiger, i hold a deep affection for los angeles and it’s oppressive sunshine. moms is moving here this summer, my kid brother’s going to middle school. middle school. fuck, i’m getting old.. in los angeles.
*Door Bell Rings*

[Verse 1]
I walked in with a pimp strut
… “What up?”
Door man’s like, “You on the list?”
I’m like, “Shiiii…
I should be there… like after the L’s”
He said it’s too early to tell
“Fuck it, go ahead.”
Afrika Bambaataa
Kool Herc was looping the break beat
Rocksteady was breakin’
That’s what’s up
Gave Scott La Rock dap
Proceeded up to the bar one Taki 183 and flat black was tight on the wall
Eddie Pint was with Dante
And went to bomb broadway
Sugarhill, Run-D.M.C. were kickin' raps
Busta and the Beasties came in, drinking brass monkeys
Bumrushed the show, hopped on stage then
A whole bunch of white dudes opened the door and came in
After Ed Lover, Dr. Dre then Big Daddy Kane
Said there ain't no half steppin', walk this way
Went to the next room had the 90's on it, "hell yeah"
Ayo it smell like chronic
Hella juice & gin
I grab my cup, try to fill it to the brim
Somebody said "Ayo, you ain't chipped in? I'm playing nephew, go ahead"
Ice Cube was choppin' it up
With MC Ren and Quik was playing the cuts
I saw Eazy, Spice 1, and King Tee
Bloods and Crips talkin shit and straight schemin’
Olde English, Starter caps, and gold daytons
Gold-plated, hearing Bones, Jheri curl activator
And the party started crackin
And this dude in the background who looked familiar started dancing...
But I don't know he seemed dope
The whole party was like he hadn't rapped in the east coast

[Hook]
Lyrical, physical, very artistical
Give the party people something funky to listen to
Step up if you wanna get hurt
Step, Step up if you wanna get hurt
All you MC's are some riders
All you need is a line
Til' you change and rearrange
And then what happened this time
I checkmate, terminate, never late, contemplate
Mind state is never fake, hesitate you lose

[Verse 2]
There was this group in the cypher called Das FX
And a Tribe Called Quest
Q-Tip was searchin' for his wallet sayin' somebody got him
10 dollars sayin' it was someone from Compton
LL was on the side of the kangol, talkin' about his Momma
Sayin' that if anyone stepped
They’d get knocked out. He promised
Watching Butter-Pecan Ricans licking their ice cream
Ghostface did lines, and Bees that were lime green
??????, liquorice and a dutch
I hit that shit once and then passed out off the blunt
I woke up in struggle for breath by Nas
He said sleep was the cousin of death, my God
Door busted down and I thought it was the cops
It was 2Pac saying that he had just gotten shot
Stood up out the wheel chair said “fuck this city.”
Grabbed a Cristal bottle, pointed it at Biggie
Puff jumped up was like “take that, one”
The whole party stopped and said…
2Pac left the party with Suge in the ‘lac
Nobody ever thought that ‘Pac would never come back
An hour later Big and Puff left
Big said he was ready to die, but there’d be life after his death
Craziest shit I’ve ever been to, the wildest venue
But it wasn't over yet, the party must continue...
Yeah, Yeah I said continue
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

[Hook 2]
Pink gators, my Detroit players
Timbs for my hooligans in Brooklyn
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
Crucial, lyrical style ain't what it used to
Microphone check one two (echo)

[Verse 3]
For some, this is where the party began
Some say it’s where the party was crashed
There was a new room, a new dude named Shady in the Aftermath
"Hi, my name is, what..." it was that everybody started to want to rap
Rock fans from the other parties put down their guitar straps
And started writing their bars on a pad
The ‘burbs were already in the building
And the media been feeling if another party was on smash
Pepsi endorsements, Spike, Coca-cola
Was tellin' the whole world where the party was at
The line to get in, it wasn't just around the building
It was around New Zealand and the underground was making chat
Saying it was wack; remember the art the heart, they taking it back
But it was too late for that, they started making, scratch the line
Complaining about the game, was saying it’s wack
Hold up, half the people that were dissing it
Were half the reason that the party was so big
And everyone in line was out there trying to get respect
And then the party got put on the internet
Shit
They bum-rushed the door
You couldn't move anymore
There wasn't room on the floor
And out came the neighbors
Getting on TV and complaining about the noise
Bill O’Reilly and Oprah came down and they started hating
The venue wasn't making money cause no one was paying
Unless you had Lil’ Wayne or T-Pain in the room
Nas came down and said the party was dead
Somebody lit a match all you heard was a
*BOOM*

[Verse 1]
Love
Showed up
At my door
Yesterday
It might sound cheesy
But I wanted her to stay

[Chorus]
I fell in love with the pizza
Girl
Now I eat pizza everyday
Oh

[Chorus]
I fell in love with the pizza
Girl
Now I eat pizza every day

[Verse 2]
I was stuck
In a box
For so long
Now
I say
That the pizza girl
She's the one for me
Yeah

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
I fell in love with the pizza
Girl
Now I eat pizza
Now I eat pizza
Now I eat pizza everyday

[Verse 1]
It all makes sense
Everybody listen to the words she says
Heading towards a consequence
For every bit of ignorance, incompetence
It's time for us to work it out

[Verse 2]
We got to work, work it out
Before the day is done
We got to be a bit stronger
'Cause we'll need it when tomorrow comes
We got to work, work
Work it out
We got to work, work
Work it out

[Verse 3]
She made her point
Building up the courage just to raise her voice
Heading towards a consequence
For every bit of ignorance, incompetence
It's time for us to work it out

[Outro]
We got to work, work it out

[Verse 1]
Try to turn on my TV to get you out of my head
Feeling something deep inside
That I just won't admit
It's not like I don't want to come in (want to come in)
I just don't know why I can't
Stop feeling like this

[Chorus]
Tell me why (why, why)
Does it hurt so bad
Tell me why (why, why)
Does it make me mad
Tell me why
Tell me why

[Verse 2]
Now you're off with someone else
And I'm stuck at home
It's getting late and now I'm feeling so alone
Now I can see the storm's not going to clear
(not going to clear)
Dressed in my pain and out of my tears

[Chorus]
Tell me why (why, why)
Does it hurt so bad (you make it hurt so bad)
Tell me why (why, why)
Does it make me mad
Tell me why
Tell me why

[Bridge]
Now I'm in pain because
Losing you is not all I lost this time

[Chorus]
Tell me why (why)
Does it hurt so bad
Tell me why (why)
Does it make me mad

(Why, why)
(Why, why)

[Chorus]
Tell me why (why, why)
Does it hurt so bad (why does it hurt so bad)
Tell me why (why, why)
Does it make me mad

[Verse 1]
I make up one more lame excuse
Why can't come out tonight
I'm not trying to cut you loose
I just need some time

[Chorus]
Oh-o-o-oh
I'm feeling love sick but I don't mind
You're the one I think about
It's every day, it's every night
Oh, call the the doctor
I'm love sick

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I'm love sick
Going back and for so long
And you're getting over
Waiting on me to be strong
And you start to wonder

[Chorus]
Oh-o-o-oh
I'm feeling love sick but I don't mind
You're the one I think about
It's every day, it's every night
O-oh, call the the doctor
I'm love sick

[Verse 3]
Woo
You're the one I think about
It's every day, it's every night
Oh, call the doctor
I'm love sick

[Verse]
Empty words, empty promises
Show me that I'm not cut out
For the road of the entertainer
Cause I'm really not that loud

[Chorus]
Too much to do and too little time
Fix it now before it isn't right
Pick up the clock and mend the broken hand
All we got to do is just believe
That time is on our side

[Chorus]
Pick up the clock and mend the broken hand
All we got to do is just believe
That time is on our side
That time is on our side

[Verse 1]
London's nice, but it’s not sunny
The desert's hot 'cause there's no rain
You can laugh, but it’s not funny
I've found a place where my heart will stay

[Verse 2]
Tokyo's fast, but I'm not winded
New York's cash, but that's ok
Italy's a priceless memory
Just go walk the streets of Spain

[Verse 3]
But I've found
That I left my heart in Scandinavia
Left my heart in Scandinavia
Left my love inside of her arms

[Chorus]
Yea, I left my heart in Scandinavia
In Scandinavia

[Chorus]
Yea, I left my heart
In Scandinavia

[Verse 1]
There's a storm coming up
And I gotta prepare myself
'Cause this feeling's getting stronger everyday
Something's creeping inside
Everything is about to change
Gotta face the fact that I can't walk away

[Chorus]
This is critical
I'm feeling helpless
So hysterical, this can't be healthy
I can't eat or sleep when you're not with me
Baby, you're the air I breathe
This is critical, yeah
So stuck on you

[Verse 2]
Used to have everything figured out
But it's different now
When you came, you saw
You conquered my heart
It's your laugh and your smile
Wanna stay for a little while
I don't wanna go, I just want you in my arms

[Chorus]
This is critical
I'm feeling helpless
So hysterical, this can't be healthy
I can't eat or sleep when you're not with me
Baby, you're the air I breathe
This is critical, yeah
So stuck on you

[Bridge]
Used to run and hide
Used to bend our love
But I can't escape this time
Oh no

[Chorus]
This is critical
I'm feeling helpless
So hysterical, this can't be healthy
I can't eat or sleep when you're not with me
Baby, you're the air I breathe
This is critical, yeah

[Outro]
Baby, it's so critical (Critical)
It's so critical (Critical), yeah
I don't like it
It's so critical (Critical)
It's so critical (Critical), yeah
So stuck on you

[Verse 1]
Mic check
Can you hear me?
Gotta know if I'm coming in clearly
Static through the speakers
In a second, your heart will be fearless
Taken for granted
Right now, you can't stand it
Break down
It's a showdown
Got to scream it out loud

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm not faking
Girl, I'm just saying

[Chorus]
Hey you, hey you
Now we're into something new
Hey you, hey you
Now you're feeling like I do
Come on, shout it
Let's leave the past behind us
Come on, shout it out
Hey you

[Verse 2]
Not open to suggestions
I'm dreaming of you and me dancing
No one's interfering
Got to do it ourselves
We don't need them
Long as we're together
We won't want anybody else, baby
Tell me if you're ready
'Cause tonight you will see

[Pre-Chorus]
That I'm not faking
Girl, I'm just saying

[Chorus]
Hey you, hey you
Now we're into something new
Hey you, hey you
Now you're feeling like I do
Come on, shout it
Let's leave the past behind us
Come on, shout it out
Hey you

[Bridge]
You doubted me
And you trusted me
And I made you see
How to find your relief
I don't know what to say
Get on your way
I gotta hear you scream

[Chorus]
Hey you, hey you
Now we're into something new
Hey you, hey you
Now you're feeling like I do
Come on, shout it
Let's leave the past behind us
Come on, shout it out
Hey you
Hey you, hey you
Now we're into something new
Hey you, hey you
Now you're feeling like I do
Come on, shout it
Let's leave the past behind us
Come on, shout it out
Hey you

[Verse 1]
Try to fall asleep tonight
I lay awake and dream of life
When we thought we could make it
Wasted all our time
But I wouldn't change
A single thing I know

[Chorus]
We get closer and closer again
But we're falling apart
I'm losing, you're losing a friend
It's always over before we start
You're asking for love and I wish
That it could be the way that it was
But it's over, there's no one to blame
It'll never be the same

[Verse 2]
Two wrong don't make it right
Too hearts are on the line
Maybe we could've made it
I've waited countless nights
In the end, I'm a friend
But that's all I am to you, oh

[Chorus]
We get closer and closer again
But we're falling apart
I'm losing, you're losing a friend
It's always over before we start
You're asking for love and I wish
That it could be the way that it was
But it's over, there's no one to blame
No, It'll never be the same

[Bridge]
No, it'll never be the same

[Chorus]
We get closer and closer again
But we're falling apart
I'm losing, you're losing a friend
It's always over before we start
You're asking for love and I wish
That it could be the way that it was
But it's over, there's no one to blame
It'll never be the same

[Bridge]
It'll never be the same
No it'll never be the same

[Outro]
It's over there's no one to blame
It'll never be the same
It's over there's no one to blame
It'll never be the same
It's over there's no one to blame
It'll never be the same
It's over there's no one to blame
It'll never be the same

[Verse 1]
On the edge of something real
I have a choice, but I don't know what to feel
Getting tired of all this fear
Before I choose, let me know that you'll be here
Let me know that you'll be here

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not afraid to fall
If you're the one who catches me
Tell me that you'll be there when I'm
About to lose it all
'Cause you're the one who helps me see
That sometimes it's ok to fall

[Verse 2]
When I'm far away from where you are
It's ok, 'cause we're under the same stars
I'm laying down this heavy load (This heavy load)
Maybe now I can finally let this go
I can finally let you know

[Chorus]
But I'm not afraid to fall
If you're the one who catches me
Tell me that you'll be there when I'm
About to lose it all
'Cause you're the one who helps me see
That sometimes it's ok

[Bridge]
To fall, oh-oh
To fall, oh-oh
To fall, oh-oh
To fall
To fall, oh-oh
To fall, oh-oh
To fall, oh-oh
To fall

[Chorus]
Not afraid to fall
If you're the one who catches me
Tell me that you'll be there when I'm
About to lose it all
'Cause you're the one who helps me see
That sometimes it's ok to fall

[Verse 3]
Oh, oh, oh ('Cause I'm not afraid to fall)
Fall, oh, oh, oh (If you're the one who catches me)
Sometimes it's ok to fall

[Outro]
When I'm about to lose it all
You're the one who helps me see
That sometimes it's ok
It will be okay
Sometimes it's ok, to fall
I'm gonna fall

[Verse 1]
It's time for something
It's time for change
It's time to get things re-arranged
Oh yeah
The summer heat
Has been getting to me
And last summer’s love is gone, gone, gone

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been saving my love for a rainy day
And it's really coming down today

[Chorus]
Then out of the blue you came
You shine a little light on a cloudy day
Baby, you could make a broken heart go away
I'm not gonna lie, this feeling inside
I can't explain
I'm gonna blame it on the summer rain
Yeah, yeah
I'm gonna blame it on the summer rain

[Verse 2]
I'm blind to some things
Yeah, blind as love
But I can see us living it up, oh yeah
When you're next to me
The butterflies are flying
I know everything is fine, fine, fine

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been saving my love for a rainy day, oh yeah
And now I'm looking for a twist of fate

[Chorus]
Then out of the blue you came
You shine a little light on a cloudy day
Baby, you could make a broken heart go away
I'm not gonna lie, this feeling inside
I can't explain
I'm gonna blame it on the summer rain
Ooh

[Verse 3]
I wanna live this day forever
Yeah, that will be alright
I'm starting to love this stormy weather
You are the sunlight (Yeah, baby)
So come and shine on me
Shine on me

[Chorus]
'Cause out of the blue you came
You shine a little light on a cloudy day
Baby, you could make a broken heart go away
I'm not gonna lie, this feeling inside
I can't explain
Yeah!
(I'm gonna blame it on the summer rain)
Then out of the blue you came
You shine a little light on a cloudy day
Baby, you could make a broken heart go away
I'm not gonna lie, this feeling inside
I can't explain
Yeah, baby
I'm gonna blame it on the summer rain
Blame it on the summer rain

[Outro]
Yeah!
Oh
Blaming it on
The summer rain
The summer rain
Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I was in the background
Fading out to the fuel
She was on the front lines
Shouting "Start up the room"
I want to get closer
But there's nothing I can do
What a shame (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I'm headed for the exit
Guess it's time to hit the road
I wish she was with me
'Cause I, I just never know
I pull the car up thinking pedal on the floor
About to take off and she opens up the door

[Chorus]
She said "Let's get going, we got time"
I can see that look inside her eyes, yeah
And to my surprise, it was all green lights
Life's a crazy ride
So get in the car and drive
Come on now
Yeah

[Verse 3]
We were in the fast lane going to who knows where
No destination, but she don't seem to care
She kept me guessing with the moonlight in her eyes
So fierce now, yeah yeah
I start to question all the things that I don't know
She doesn't answer, she just turns up the radio, ooh yeah

[Chorus]
She said "Let's get going, we got time" (We got time, we got time)
I can see that look inside her eyes
And to my surprise (and to my surprise) it was all green lights
Life's a crazy ride
So get in the car and drive

[Bridge]
Sometimes in life, moments arrive
Things don't turn out the way that you planned
So never think twice
Just get in the car and drive
Yeah, yeah
Come on now
Come on now

[Chorus]
She said "Let's get going, we got time" (We got time)
I can see that look inside her eyes, yeah
And to my surprise (and to my surprise) it was all green lights
Life's a crazy ride
(So get in the car and drive)

[Chorus]
She said "Let's get going, we got time" (Got time, got time)
I can see that look inside her eyes, yeah
(I can see that look inside her eyes)
And to my surprise, it was all green lights
Life's a crazy ride
You just can't think twice
So get in the car and drive
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I can feel you all around
In the silence, I hear the sound
Of your footsteps on the ground
And my heart slows down
So now I'm

[Chorus]
I'm waiting for the moonlight
So I can find you in this perfect dream
Don't think that you can hide there in the shadows
Girl, you're not invisible
You're all that I can see

[Verse 2]
Something’s changing deep inside
All my hopes are comin' alive
As we're fading into the night
I can see your eyes
So I keep on

[Chorus]
I'm waiting for the moonlight
So I can find you in this perfect dream
Don't think that you can hide there in the shadows
Girl, you're not invisible
You're all that I can see

[Bridge]
See in the darkness, believe we can make this
All we want is to be
We can stay forever 'cause when we're together
I'm stuck in this fantasy
I don't wanna leave

[Chorus]
And I'll keep waiting for the moonlight
So I can find you in this perfect dream
Don't think that you can hide there in the shadows
Girl, you're not invisible
I'm waiting for the moonlight
So I can find you in this perfect dream
Don't think that you can hide there in the shadows
Girl, you're not invisible
Girl, you're not invisible
You're all that I can see

[Outro]
And my heart slows down

[Verse 1]
You say you'll know when you really find the one
But it's hard to tell with the damage that's been done
But I’d like to say that it's your fault
But I know better
‘Cause I'm a fool to think you'll wait around forever

[Chorus]
Maybe I could have loved you
Maybe I could have shown
That I still do care about you
More than you could know
Don't say it's too late to try
To make it right
Oh, to make it right, yeah

[Verse 2]
I didn't know how good you were for me
Now it's clear I'm seeing all that we could be
And I know that it's my fault, but I'm gonna treat you better
'Cause if I had one wish, you'd be with me forever

[Chorus]
Maybe I could have loved you
Maybe I could have shown
That I still do care about you
More than you could know
Don't say it's too late to try
To make it right

[Verse 3]
Oh, is there something I can say?
Show me how to break it down
So before you walk away
Take the time to turn around
Listen to me now

[Chorus]
Maybe I could have loved you
Maybe I could have shown
That I still do care about you
More than you could know
Don't say it's too late to try
Maybe I could have loved you
Maybe I could have shown
That I still do care about you
More than you could know
Don't say it's too late to try
To make it right

[Outro]
Oh, to make it right
Make it right
Gonna make it right, oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm just another back street kid
Rock and roll music is the only thing I really dig
Can't stop the music going round inside my head
I'm a rock and roll soldier, gonna play it until I'm dead

[Chorus]
Nobody I know will ever take
My rock and roll away from me

[Verse 2]
Sitting in the back seat of a shiny limousine
Living in a taxi can't remember where I've been
Playing my music, sitting in my hotel room
Writing about the stars and thinking about the hand of doom

[Chorus]
Nobody I know will ever take
My rock and roll away from me

[Bridge]
Living life comes easy if you know which way you're going
Got to see yourself in other's eyes, surprised?
Living like I want to don't come easy, but I'm trying
Sorting out what's true and what are lies, it's wise

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Brought up in a back street living with the salt of the land
Seems that now my music's paying off my tax demands
So listen to the music, want to see you get so high
Cause I'm a back street rocker and I will be till the day I die

[Chorus]
Nobody I know will ever take
My rock and roll away from me

[Verse 1]
I’m just a man and I am what I am, yeah
Nobody will ever change my ways
I don’t need money and I don’t need no lies
I only need to live for today
But I’d like to talk things over with you
I want to hear the things you say, today
Although you won’t change me anyway, oh no way

[Verse 2]
I wish you’d come and see me, I’d like to hold you
I want to set my mind all free
You understand me woman, you give me time, yeah
But I don’t need no sympathy
Still I wonder what it’s like to be loved
Instead of hiding in myself
Nobody will change me anyway, no no way

[Chorus]
Nobody’s gonna change my world
That’s something too unreal
Nobody will change the way I feel

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
So listen to me now hear what I say, yeah
Please give me time and maybe love
If there’s a God up there, well I hope he helps me
I need you now to set me free
’Cause it may be that it’s over for me
If you don’t hear the things that I say, today
Nobody will change me anyway, no no way

[Chorus]
Nobody’s gonna change my world
That’s something too unreal
Nobody will change the way I feel

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
Told you once about your friends and neighbours
They were always seeking, but they'll never find it

[Chorus]
It's alright, yes, it's alright

[Verse 2]
Where to go and where to see?
It's always been that way and it can never be

[Chorus]
It's alright, yes, it's alright

[Verse 3]
Give it all and ask for no return
And very soon you'll see and you'll begin to learn

[Refrain]
That's it's alright, yes, it's alright

[Bridge]
Uh, uhhh-uhh
Uhh-uhh, uh-uh-uhhh

[Chorus]
It's alright, yes, it's alright

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Don't you know that it's so good for you
You can be making love and see it all go through

[Chorus]
But it's alright, yes, it's alright

[Verse 5]
Someone told you once about your friends and neighbours
They were always seeking but they'll never find it

[Chorus]
It's alright, yes, it's alright

[Outro]
Oh, ohhh-oh
Uh, uhhh-uhh
Uh, uhhh-uhh

[Verse 1]
Watching the universe at the end of another day
Fatalistic ships from a distant shore
In the back of my mind, I could see she was standing there
Like the feeling you have when you've been there before

[Bridge]
She was a gypsy woman
She was as cold as the day, yeah
She said I'd got it coming
And then she took me away, yeah
She took me through the shadows of her sunken dream
I thought it's over for me, she wasn't all she seemed

[Verse 2]
She took my hand and then she started to speak
She told me she'd had the call
With eyes of fire that were burning my soul
She looked into her crystal ball
She read my fortune then she read my mind
She didn't like my thoughts at all
She showed me shadows, a specter of life
My soul just wanted to scream
She stared so deeply into my eyes
That's when I fell into a dream
When I awoke in bed she lay beside me
And as she read me with her eyes, she said

[Chorus]
So you wanna be a gypsy, come on now
So you wanna be a gypsy, come on now, now, now

[Verse 3]
Gypsy woman you're the devil in drag
You are the queen of all Hell
You took my body, now you're wasting my soul
You've got me under your spell
And as the sun shines on another day
You're gonna take my mind as well, it's over

[Chorus]
So you wanna be a gypsy, come on now
So you wanna be a gypsy, come on now
So you wanna be a gypsy, come on now
So you wanna be a gypsy
Gypsy, gypsy
Gypsy, gypsy

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
Super animation, turning on a nation
And they're saying all moving parts stand still
Since he was elected, adrenalin injected
Hear him saying all moving parts should kill
Just like the hero he's got them all on the run
Yes, he’s won

[Verse 2]
Since he passed the motion
They're building in the ocean
And he's saying all men should all be free
What a combination, peace and radiation
And he's saying free men should fight for me
Just like his momma, he seems to get his pleasure from pain
And the rain, ain’t that strange? Very strange

[Bridge]
I like choking toys
You've got to see me before you meet the boys
Teacher's burnt the school
He’s had enough of sticking to the rules, alright!
People stop and see
He's got to be more decadent than me
Just to pass the time
He gets his kicks from licking off the wine

[Verse 3]
Pretty silly ladies
All Cynthia's and Sadie's
Call him up and he takes their numbers down
Says he is a woman
I should have seen it coming
And she's saying she's married to a clown
Just like a lady, she'll keep you guessing through the night
Not tonight, well I might, oh alright

[Verse 1]
Well I'm sick and tired of hearing
'Bout the world and its hangups
Gonna get myself together
Take a ride downtown

[Chorus]
Gotta see my rock and roll doctor
Gotta see my rock and roll doctor
Gotta see my rock and roll doctor
I gotta see him, see him today
He’s gonna blow me away

[Verse 2]
He makes me happy
When I'm feeling down, yeah
Takes away my worry
Takes away my frown

[Chorus]
Gotta see my rock and roll doctor
Gotta see my rock and roll doctor
Gotta see my rock and roll doctor
I gotta see him, see him today
He gonna blow me away

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
If you wanna feel groovy
Give the doctor a call
Doctor rock will help you
Anytime at all

[Chorus]
Gotta see my rock and roll doctor
Gotta see my rock and roll doctor
Gotta see my rock and roll doctor
I gotta see him, see him today
He gonna blow me away

[Verse 1]
I've been a long long time—waiting for you
I didn't want to see you go—oh, no, no
And now, it's hurting so much, what can I do?
I wanted you to be my wife
The days are passing slowly since you've gone
Your memories are all I have—yes, I have
I sit here waiting, but—you'll never show
Without you, I can't carry on—oh, my baby

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
You said you'd always love me—all of my life
And then you said your last goodbye—yeah, goodbye
Why the sudden changes, why all of the lies?
I should have seen it in your eyes
The endless hours of heartache—waiting for you
My summer love has turned to rain—all the pain
The silent emptiness—of one sided love
My life means nothing now you're gone—oh, my baby

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
The neon lights are shinin' on me again
I walk the lonely streets in search of a friend
I need a lady to help me to get through the night
Through the night
If I could find her then everything would be alright

[Verse 2]
The sleepy city is dreamin' the night time away
Out on the street, I watch tomorrow becomin' today
I see a man, he's got take away women for sale
Yes, for sale
Guess that's the answer, 'cause take away women don't fail

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh, dirty women, they don't mess around
Oh, dirty women, they don't mess around
You've got me comin', you've got me goin' around
Oh, dirty women, they don't mess around

[Outro]
Walkin' the streets I wonder will it ever happen (dirty women)
Gotta be good 'cause then everything will be okay (dirty women)
If I could score tonight then I will end up happy (dirty women)
A woman for sale is gonna help me save my day (dirty women)
(Dirty women, dirty women, dirty women, dirty women...)

[Verse 1]
People going nowhere, taken for a ride
Looking for the answers that they know inside
Searching for a reason, looking for a rhyme
Snow white parasite, partners in crime

[Chorus]
Don't they ever have to worry?
Don't you ever wonder why?
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again

[Verse 2]
Sunday satisfaction, madness on the rise
Truth is on the doorstep, welcoming the lies
All dressed up in sorrow, got no place to go
Hold tight, do it right, taking it slow

[Chorus]
Don't they ever have to worry?
Don't you ever wonder why?
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again

[Bridge]
Don't you ever say die
Don't you ever say die
Never say die

[Verse 3]
Fading silver lining, writing's on the wall
Children get together, you can save us all
Future's on the corner, showing us our time
Slow down, turn around, everything's fine

[Chorus]
There's no need to have a reason
There's no need to wonder why
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Never say die!

[Verse 1]
Tortured and twisted, he walks the streets alone
People avoid him, they know the street's his home
Cold blade of silver, his eyes, they burn so wild
Mean as a tiger, society's own child

[Pre-Chorus]
Those that tried to burn him paid
You don't do that to Johnny Blade

[Chorus]
He's the meanest guy around his town
One look and he will cut you down
Johnny Blade, Johnny Blade

[Verse 2]
Life has no meaning and Death's his only friend
Will fate surprise him, where will he meet his end?
He feels so bitter, yes, he's so full of hate
To die in the gutter, I guess that's Johnny's fate

[Pre-Chorus]
Rivals all across the land
He kills them with his knife in hand

[Chorus]
He's the meanest guy around his town
One look and he will cut you down
Johnny Blade, Johnny Blade
Johnny Blade, Johnny Blade

[Bridge]
Well you know that Johnny's a spider
And his web is the city at night
He's a victim of modern frustration
That's the reason he's so ready to fight
He's the one who should be afraid
What will happen to you, Johnny Blade?

[Verse 3]
Oh, he knows his future's decided
And he ain't gonna change it, no way
He was born to die in the gutter
He'll keep fighting till the end of his days

[Bridge]
Been alone all through his life
His only friend is a switchblade knife
He's the one who should be afraid
What will happen to you, Johnny Blade?

[Outro]
You fool the people
Who's fooling who?
It's time to listen
The fool is you

[Verse 1]
Junior's eyes looked up to the skies in tears
He prayed that his maker, the giver and taker, would hear
Junior sighed as his hands reached out to the sky
Junior cried the day that his best friend died
Yeah!

[Chorus]
You're coming home again tomorrow
I'm sorry it won't be for long
With all the pain I've watched you live within
I'll try my hardest not to cry
When it is time to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Junior's eyes, they couldn't disguise the pain
His father was leaving and Junior's grieving again
Innocent eyes watched the man who gave everything
Junior's sorrow, he knew what tomorrow would bring

[Chorus]
They're coming home again tomorrow
I'm sorry it won't be for long
With all the pain I've watched you live within
I'll try my hardest not to cry
When it is time to say goodbye

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Junior's eyes looked into the skies once more
Now he knew well, this life was hell for sure
He desperately tried, his fingertips stretched to the stars, yeah
Reaching for reason, along with the time and the scars
Yeah!

[Chorus]
You're coming home again tomorrow
I'm sorry it won't be for long
With all the pain I've watched you live within
I'll try my hardest not to cry
When it is time to say goodbye

[Verse 1]
She sits in silence, in her midnight world
With faded pictures, of a dancing girl
Her, distant dreamer, on the seas of time
Her happy memories, dancing through her mind

[Chorus]
In days of romance
She was the queen of dance
She'd dance the night away

[Verse 2]
And as the seasons turn the days to years
She holds her pictures, hears the silent cheers
The days grow lonely for the dancing queen
And now, she dances only in her dreams

[Chorus]
In days of romance
She was the queen of dance
She'd dance the night away, away, away, away

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Old men crying, young men dying
World still turns as Father Time looks on
On and on
Children playing, dreamers praying
Laughter turns to tear as love has gone
Has it gone?

[Refrain]
Oh, it's a hard road
Oh, it's a hard road

[Verse 2]
Whirlwind churning, lovers learning
On this path of life, we can't back down
Is it wrong?
Widows weeping, babies sleeping
Life becomes the singer and the song
Sing along

[Refrain]
Oh, it's a hard road
Carry your own load!

[Chorus]
Why make the hard road?
Why can't we be friends?
No need to hurry
We'll meet in the end

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Why make the hard road?
Why can't we be friends?
No need to worry
Let's sing it again

[Verse 3]
Brother's sharing, mother's caring
Nighttime falling victim to the dawn
Shadows small
Days are crawling, time is calling
To the Earth, another life is gone
Love line's drawn

[Refrain]
Oh, it's a hard road
Carry your own load!

[Outro]
(Oh, it's a hard road)
(Oh, it's a hard road)
Forget all your sorrow (Oh, it's a hard road)
Don't live in the past
And look to the future (Oh, it's a hard road)
'Cause life goes too fast, you know
Forget all your sorrow (Oh, it's a hard road)
Don't live in the past
And look to the future (Oh, it's a hard road)
'Cause life goes too fast, you know
Forget all your sorrow (Oh, it's a hard road)
Don't live in the past
And look to the future (Oh, it's a hard road)
'Cause life goes too fast, you know

[Verse 1]
There's no reason for you to run
You can't escape the fate of the chosen one
Black moon rising, in a blood red sky
This time you realise that you're gonna die
Drinking your blood brew is your answer
That's what you plan to do
No dreaming, time you cheat this master
You're on your own going through
Wind of mist has taken over your mind
And you think you're on your own
Don't believe you are the only one here
Look around, you're not alone

[Chorus]
Feel the forces from another world
Ghostly shadows fill your mind
Evil power hanging over you
As you freeze, you're like a child
(Look behind) Look behind you!

[Verse 2]
Somebody's calling, someone is near
Feel yourself falling, falling with fear
You tell yourself you're dreaming
You realise you're screaming
You know that this shouldn't happen to you
You tell yourself that it just can't be true
But there is nothing you can do, oh!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Ghostly shadows from the other world
Evil forces in your mind
Trapped between the worlds of life and death
Frozen in the realms of time
(Look behind) Look behind you!

[Outro]
You feel yourself falling, you're at the end of the line
Your body is crawling, but your senses are blind
Cold, cold feelings are running through your brains
Ice cold fingers, running through your veins

[Verse 1]
Born in a window
Nobody's fool
Raised in a prison
You called a school
Taught your religion
Told what to do
I handed my childhood
Over to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Traveling endlessly, I'm searching for mind
I'm almost afraid of what I will find
Wandering aimlessly, oh, what can I do?
I handed my future over to you, to you

[Chorus]
Over to you
Future looks blue
What can I do?

[Verse 2]
Working for freedom
Fighting your wars
Feeding our children
Keeping your laws
Someday you’ll suffer
Then what I’ll do
I’ll hand all your promises
Over to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing inside myself, I'm losing control
You made me believe in the stories you told
Waiting impatiently, what else can I do?
I handed my future over to you, to you

[Chorus]
Over to you
Future looks blue
What can I do?

[Verse 3]
Tears full of sadness
Sealed in my cell
Whispering secrets
What do they tell
Mad politicians
Can’t tell it true
I handed my children
Over to you

[Outro]
All over, over to you
All over, over to you
All over, over to you...

[Verse 1]
It's against my uniform
To be a civil judge
All the songs are history now
'Bout rock stars and their grudge
Let us cast our minds back
To thirty years or more
You took up all the vandals
Will Hitler beat 'em all?

[Chorus]
And we're sad and sorry
We're really sorry that it happened that way
Yes, we're sad and sorry
But why'd you have to treat us that way?

[Verse 2]
Compare ourselves with others
And cover them in sin
Oh, God what a terrible
A terrible state we're in
There must be some way out of here
A compromise that's right
If we cannot work it out
We're gonna have to fight

[Chorus]
And we're sad and sorry
We're really sorry that it happened that way
Yes, we're sad and sorry
We cannot go on in those days

[Bridge]
I'm talking about my brothers
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout sisters as well
And I wish you good luck
Good luck!

[Outro]
Oh, but the world's still on fire (you gotta believe)
Chain the hope you take on, liar (you gotta believe)
This fire (you gotta believe)
We're on fire, we're on fire, yeah! (you gotta believe)

[Verse 1]
Oh no, here it comes again
Can't remember when we came so close to love before
Hold on, good things never last
Nothing's in the past, it always seems to come again
Again and again, again and again, and again

[Verse 2]
Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Captain's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights

[Bridge]
Circles and rings, dragons and kings
Weaving a charm and a spell
Blessed by the night, holy and bright
Called by the toll of the bell
Bloodied angels fast descending
Moving on a never-bending light
Phantom figures free forever
Out of shadows, shining ever-bright

[Refrain]
Neon Knights!
Neon Knights!
All right!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Captain's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights
Again and again, again and again, and again

[Refrain]
Neon Knights!
Neon Knights!
Neon Knights!
All right!

[Intro]
In the misty morning, on the edge of time
We've lost the rising sun, a final sign
As the misty morning rolls away to die
Reaching for the stars, we blind the sky

[Verse 1]
We sailed across the air before we learned to fly
We thought that it could never end
We'd glide above the ground before we learned to run, run
Now it seems our world has come undone

[Chorus]
Oh, they say that it's over
And it just had to be
Oh, they say that it's over
We're lost children of the sea
Oh, woah!

[Verse 2]
We made the mountains shake with laughter as we played
Hiding in our corner of the world
Then we did the demon dance and rushed to nevermore
Threw away the key and locked the door

[Chorus]
Oh, they say that it's over, yeah
And it just had to be
Yes, they say that it's over
We're lost children of the sea
Oh!

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
In the misty morning, on the edge of time
We've lost the rising sun, a final sign
As the misty morning rolls away to die
Reaching for the stars, we blind the sky

[Chorus]
Oh, they say that it's over
And it just had to be
Oh, they say that it's over
Poor lost children of the sea
Yeah!

[Outro]
Look out! The sky is falling down!
Look out! The world is spinning round and round and round!
Look out! The sun is going black, black!
Look out! It's never never never coming back, look out!

[Verse 1]
Lord, she's handsome as she flows across the floor
Nothing I've seen in my life has ever pleased me more
She's got the look of freedom and it makes you think she's wild
But I can see right through it all, it's her way to have a child

[Chorus]
Oh, walk away
She's looking to love you
There's nothing to say
Just turn your head and walk away
Walk away, walk on

[Verse 2]
She moves in sunlight, never seen the night at all
Like a star in the midnight sky, burns before it falls
I've never been lonely and I can't imagine why
Maybe she could be the one to tell me, I guess it's do or die

[Bridge]
Can't see her fire
But I can feel her heat, all right
It's rising higher
I'm walking the wire!
Walk on by

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh, walk away
She's looking to love you
There's nothing to say
Just turn your head and walk away
Oh, walk on by, walk away
Walk on

[Outro]
You'll feel her fire, she'll lift you higher
But don't be fooled, just turn your head and walk away

[Verse 1]
There's a place just south of Witches' Valley
Where they say the wind won't blow
And they only speak in whispers of her name
There's a lady they say who feeds the darkness
It eats right from her hand
With a crying shout, she'll search you out
And freeze you where you stand

[Chorus]
Lady Evil, evil
She's a magical, mystical woman
Lady Evil, evil in my mind
She's the queen of the night

[Verse 2]
In a place just south of Witches' Valley
Where they say the rain won't fall
Thunder cracks the sky, it makes you bleed, yeah
There's a lady they say who needs the darkness
She can't face the light
With an awful shout, she'll find you out
And have you before the night

[Chorus]
Lady Evil, evil
She's a magical, mystical woman
Lady Evil, evil on my mind
She's the queen of the night

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
So if you ever get to Witches' Valley
Don't dream or close your eyes
And never trust your shadow in the dark
'Cause there's a lady I know who takes your vision
And turns it all around
The things you see are what to be, lost and never found

[Chorus]
Lady Evil, evil
She's a magical, mystical woman
Lady Evil, evil on my mind
She's the queen of the night

[Outro]
Gonna do you right
She's the queen of sin
Look out, she'll pull you in!
Lady wonder!

[Verse 1]
Sing me a song, you're a singer
Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil
The Devil is never a maker
The less that you give, you're a taker

[Chorus]
So, it's on and on and on
It's Heaven and Hell, oh well, yeah

[Verse 2]
The lover of life's not a sinner
The ending is just a beginner
The closer you get to the meaning
The sooner you'll know that you're dreaming

[Chorus]
So, it's on and on and on
Oh, it's on and on and on
It goes on and on and on
Heaven and Hell, I can tell
Fool, fool

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Yeah-yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Well, if it seems to be real, it's illusion
For every moment of truth, there's confusion in life
Love can be seen as the answer
But nobody bleeds for the dancer

[Chorus]
And it's on and on, on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
They say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you gotta ride it well
The world is full of Kings and Queens
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams
It's Heaven and Hell, oh well
And they'll tell you black is really white
The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's Heaven and Hell, oh no!
Fool, fool!
You've got to bleed for the dancer!
Fool, fool!
Look for the answer!
Fool, fool, fool!

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Throw me a penny and I'll make you a dream
You find that life's not always what it seems, no no
Then think of a rainbow and I'll make it come real
Roll me, I'm a never ending wheel

[Chorus]
I'll give you a star
So you know just where you are
Don't you know that I might be your wishing well?
Your wishing well!

[Verse 2]
Look in the water, tell me what do you see
Reflections of the love you give to me
Love isn't money, it's not something you buy
So let me fill myself with tears you cry, and why?

[Bridge]
Time is a never ending journey
Love is a never ending smile
Give me a sign to build a
Dream on, dream on

[Guitar Solo]
(Dream on, dream on)
(Dream on, dream on)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, throw me a penny and I'll make you a dream
You find that life's not always what it seems, no no
Love isn't money, it's not something you buy
Let me fill myself with tears you cry

[Chorus]
I'll give you a star
So you know just where you are
Someday, some way, you'll feel the things I say
Dream for a while of the things that make you smile
'Cause you know, don't you know?
Oh, you know that I'm your wishing well
Your wishing well, your wishing well
I wish you well, I'm your wishing well

[Verse 1]
Ooh, gather the wind, though the wind won't help you fly at all
Your back's to the wall
Chain the sun and it tears away
To face you as you run, you run, you run
Behind the smile, there's danger and a promise to be told
You'll never get old
Life's fantasy to be locked away
And still, to think you're free, you're free, we're free

[Chorus]
So live for today
Tomorrow never comes

[Bridge]
Die young, die young
Can't you see the writing in the air?
Die young, gonna die young
Someone stopped the fair

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Gather the wind, though the wind won't help you fly at all
Your back's to the wall
Then chain the sun and it tears away
And it tears away to face you as you run, you run, you run

[Chorus]
So live for today
Tomorrow never comes

[Outro]
Die young, young
Die young, die young
Die young, die young, young
Die young, die young, die young, die young, die young!
A rumble of thunder
I'm suddenly under your spell
No rhyme or reason or time of the season, but oh well
The darkened deliver
I shake and I shiver down your soul
You know what to cover
I think for another it's a story told
So get a good hold

Regiment fooled you
You thought that you knew who you are
A simple equation, that's the relation
But that's gone too far
A time of suspension, a special condition
That we all know
So let it all go

Turn up the night
Turn up the night
Turn up the night
It feels so right
Nighttime sorrow, taken like the pain
Black will not become white
It's all the same
Evil lurks in twilight, dances in the dark
Makes you need the movement
Like a fire needs a spark to burn

A rumble of thunder
I'm suddenly under your spell
No rhyme or reason or time of the season, but oh well
The darkened deliver
I shake and I shiver down your soul
So get a good hold

Turn up the night
Turn up the night
Turn up the night
It feels so bright

Gotta turn up the night
Turn up the night
Turn up the night
It feels so right

Turn up the night
Turn up the night
Get out the light
Turn up the night
If it feels right
Turn up the night
If it feels right
Shut out the light
Turn up the night
Turn up the night
Say you don't know me, you'll burn
You can refuse, but you'll lose, it's by me
Say you don't want me, you'll learn
Nothin' you do will be new, cause I'm through

Call me a liar, you knew
You were a fool, but that's cool, it's all right
Call me the Devil, it's true
Some can't accept but I crept inside you

So if a stranger calls you
Don't let him whisper his name
Cause it's Voodoo, oh

Fade into shadow, you'll burn
Your fortune is free, I can see it's no good
Never look back, never turn
It's a question of time 'till you're mine and you learn

So if a stranger sees you
Don't look in his eyes
Cause he's Voodoo
Say you don't know me, you'll burn
You can refuse, but you'll lose, it's by me
Say you don't want me, you'll learn
Nothing you do will be new, cause I'm through

Voodoo

Bring me your children, they'll burn
Never look back, never turn
Cry me a river, you'll learn Voodoo
If there isn't light when no one sees
Then how can I know what you might believe?
A story told that can't be real
Somehow must reflect the truth we feel, yeah

Fade away, fade away
Vanish into smoke
Fade away, fade away
Break the crystal ball

It's the sign
Feels like the time

On a small world, west of wonder
Somewhere, nowhere all
There's a rainbow that will shimmer
When the summer falls
If an echo doesn't answer
When it hears a certain song
Then the Beast is free to wander
But never seen around
And it's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern cross, alright
Sail away to the sign

From the book, the word is spoken
Whispers from forgotten psalms
Gather all around the young ones
They will make us strong

Reach above your dreams of pleasure
Give a knife to those who died
Look beyond your own horizons
Sail the ship of sighs

And it's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern cross

Fade away, fade away
Break the crystal ball
Fade away, fade away
I can't accept it anymore

On a real world, west of wonder
Somewhere, nowhere all
There's a rainbow, see it shimmer
When the summer falls
From the book, the word is spoken
Whispers from forgotten psalms
Gather all around the young ones
They will make us strong
It's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern cross

Don't live for pleasure
Make life your treasure
Fade away

Eight miles high, about to fall
And no one there to catch you
Look for the sign, the time
The sign of the southern cross
Play on!

[Verse 1]
Close the city and tell the people that
Something's coming to call
Death and darkness are rushing forward to
Take a bite from the wall, oh
You've nothing to say
They're breaking away

[Hook]
If you listen to fools
The mob rules
The mob rules

[Verse 2]
Kill the spirit and you'll be blinded
The end is always the same
Play with fire, you burn your fingers and
Lose your hold of the flame, oh
It's over, it's done
The end is begun

[Hook]
If you listen to fools
The mob rules

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
You've nothing to say
Oh, they're breaking away
If you listen to fools

[Verse 3]
Break the circle and stop the movement
The wheel is thrown to the ground
Just remember it might start rolling and
Take you right back around

[Outro]
You're all fools
The mob rules
Fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine
She was up from another world, just to bust another soul
Her eyes were an endless flame, holy lightning
Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, yeah

We sailed away on a crimson tide, gone forever
Left my heart on the other side, all to break it into bits
Her smile was a winter song, a Sabbath ending
Don't sleep or you'll find me gone, just an image in the air

In dreams I think of you
I don't know what to do with myself
Time has let me down
She brings broken dreams, fallen stars
The endless search for where you are
(sail on, sail on)

Fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine
She was up from another world, just to bust another soul
Her eyes were an endless flame, unholy lightning
Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, oh!
Don't sail away on a crimson tide!
Don't leave your heart on the other side!
Her eyes are an endless flame
Desire with a special name
Don't ever fall in love!
Don't give your heart away!
No never, never fall in love with a country girl!
Slipping away, just a heartbeat from disaster
Nothing could make me stay, close your eyes and I'll be gone
Turn the page, yeah, time to start another story
Slipping away, slipping away, time to move along

No reason to stay
Oh, when I'm slipping away

Take a look at yourself, you've been running in a circle
Round and round you go, you're a start without an end
Start a new life, yeah, from the city of the gypsies
Running away, slipping away, right behind the plow

Slipping away
Slipping away
Nobody to pay
Look out, 'cause I'm slipping away

Rockin' the glass, I won't leave you my reflection
A future without a past, no more road to take me back
Come if you will, just don't question my direction
Running away, slipping away, we can find the sun
Slipping away
Slipping away
Got nobody to pay
And you're slippin' away

No more running in a circle
It's time to move along
Round, round, round we go
A start without an end
So I'm slipping away
Slipping away

[Verse 1]
I think about closing the door
And lately I think of it more
I'm living well out of my time
I feel like I'm losing my mind

[Verse 2]
I should be at the table round
A servant of the crown
The keeper of the sign
To sparkle and to shine

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Never, no never again!
Listen to me and believe what I say if you can
Never, this is the end
You know I've seen the faces of doom
And I'm only a man

[Verse 4]
Help me, tell me I'm sane
I feel a change in the earth, in the wind and the rain
Save me, oh, take me away
You know I've seen some creatures from hell
And I've heard what they say!

[Chorus]
I've got to be strong
Oh, I'm falling off the edge of the world
Think you're safe, but you're wrong!
We are falling off the edge of the world!

[Verse 5]
Look out, there's danger, nowhere to run!
It seems like desperate measures but sometimes it's got to be done
Over, it's over at last
There's a message inside as we build
A new life from the past

[Chorus]
We're falling off the edge of the world!
Yes, the edge of the world!
It's the end of the world!

[verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I'm dying at dawn
And sometimes I'm warm as fire
But lately I feel like I'm just gonna rain

[Chorus]
And it goes over, and over, and over again, yeah

[verse 2]
Too many flames, with too much to burn
And life's only made of paper
Oh, how I need to be free of this pain

[Chorus]
But it goes over, and over, and over, and over again

[guitar solo 1]

[verse 3]
Yeah, sometimes I cry for the lost and alone
And for their dreams that will all be ashes
But lately I feel like I'm just gonna rain

[Chorus]
And it goes over, and over, and over, and over again

[guitar solo 2]

[outro]
(Over)
(Over)
(Over)
(Again)

[Verse 1]
You build me up, you knock me down
Provoke a smile and make me frown
You are the queen of runaround
You know it's true
You chew me up and spit me out
Enjoy the taste I leave in your mouth
You look at me, I look at you
Neither of us know what to do

[Chorus]
There may not be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied til I'm under your skin

[Verse 2]
Immobilized by the thought of you
I'm paralyzed by the sight of you
I'm hypnotized by the words you say
Not true, but I believe 'em anyway
So come to bed, it's getting late
There's no more time for us to waste
Remember how my body tastes
You feel your heart begin to race

[Chorus]
There may not be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in (Hey)
And I shiver when I hear your name
Think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin (Yeah, yeah)

[Guitar Solo]
Yeah, oh
(You feel your heart begin to race!)

[Chorus]
There may not be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
And I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin
Yeah, yeah, there may not be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
And I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Intro]
Mmm

[Verse 1]
I'm full of regret
For all things that I have done and said
And I don't know
If it'll ever be okay to show
My face around here (Face around here)
Sometimes I wonder if I disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
Would you ever turn your head and look?
See if I'm gone
'Cause I fear

[Chorus]
There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear, that you wanna know, I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful, oh

[Verse 2]
You're just innocent
A helpless victim of a spider's web
And I'm an insect
Goin' after anything that I can get

[Pre-Chorus]
So you better turn your head and run
And don't look back
'Cause I fear

[Chorus]
There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear, that you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful, oh
(Shameful, shameful)
And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad, strung you along, oh, shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
You better turn your head and run
See if I'm gone
'Cause I fear

[Chorus]
There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear, that you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful, oh
(Shameful, shameful)
And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad, strung you along, oh, shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up
Yeah, tangled
(And I've done you so wrong)
(Treated you bad, strung you along, oh, shame on myself)
(I don't know how I got so tangled up)

[Verse 1]
After school, walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails
And I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
And trying to recreate
Images life gives us from our past
And sometimes it's a sad song

[Chorus]
But I cannot forget, refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away, make every day
Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
And mama, I've been crying
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, "The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the Sun"
Oh, whoa, oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Now, moving on, down my street
I see people I won't ever meet
I think of her, take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps
And sometimes it's a sad song, oh

[Chorus]
But I cannot forget, refuse to regret
So glad I met you, and
Take my breath away, make every day
Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
And mama, I've been crying
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, "The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the Sun"

[Bridge]
The rhythm of her conversation
The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt when she first saw me
Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player
Back and forth and here and gone
And on and on and on and on

[Chorus]
I cannot forget, refuse to regret
So glad I met you, and
Take my breath away, make every day
Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
And mama, I've been crying
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, "The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles"
She said, "The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the Sun"

[Outro]
Yeah, oh, oh, yeah
(Several miles from the Sun, yeah)
(Woo!)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
I've been the needle and the thread
Weaving figure eights and circles round your head
I try to laugh but cry instead
Patiently wait to hear the words you've never said

[Pre-Chorus]
Fumbling through your dresser drawer
Forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you crying

[Chorus]
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing 'til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
"This is not goodbye," she said
It is just time for me to rest my head
She does not walk, she runs instead
Down these jagged streets and into my bed

[Pre-Chorus]
When I was fumbling through your dresser drawer
Forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you crying

[Chorus]
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing 'til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out

[Bridge]
There's only so much I can do for you, oh
After all of the things you put me through, oh

[Chorus]
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing 'til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing 'til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out

[Outro]
(Whoa) I'm lifting you up (Oh)
I'm letting you down (Whoa)
I'm dancing 'til dawn
I'm fooling around (Whoa)
I'm not giving up (Whoa)
I'm making your love (Yeah)
This city's made us crazy and we must get out

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Sunday morning, rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin (Like that)
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do (Life is hard)
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday, it would lead me back to you
That someday, it would lead me back to you (Someday)

[Chorus]
That may be all I'll need
In darkness, she is all I see (All I see)
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

[Verse 2]
(Yeah) Fingers trace your every outline (Oh yeah, yeah)
(Yeah) Paint a picture with my hands (Oh, oh, whoa)
And back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

[Chorus]
That may be all I need (All I need)
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh yeah
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do (Life gets hard)
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you, yeah
(Someday, oh, someday, oh)
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

[Chorus]
You may not know
That may be all I need (All I need)
In darkness, she is all I see (You are all I see)
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
Driving slow, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
It's a flower in your hair
I'm a flower in your hair
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, oh
Whoa, oh, yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Watch the sunrise
Say your goodbyes
Off you go
Some conversation
No contemplation
Hit the road

[Verse 2]
Car overheats
Jump out of my seat
On the side of the highway, baby
Our road is long
Your hold is strong
Please don't ever let go, oh no

[Chorus]
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it?
Oh no, they can't

[Verse 3]
I'm driving fast now
Don't think I know how to go slow
Oh, where you at now?
I feel around
There you are

[Verse 4]
Cool these engines
Calm these jets
I ask you how hot can it get
And as you wipe off beads of sweat
Slowly you say, "I'm not there yet!"

[Chorus]
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh, but can they keep it?
Oh no, they can't

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh, but can they keep it?
Oh no, they can't
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Can you see me
Floating above your head
As you lay in bed
Thinking about everything
That you did not do?
'Cause saying "I love you"
Has nothing to do with meaning it, oh

[Verse 2]
And I don't trust you
'Cause every time you're here
Your intentions are unclear
I spend every hour waiting for a phone call
That I know will never come
I used to think you were the one
Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all

[Chorus]
You ain't ever coming back to me
And that's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

[Verse 3]
Do you remember the way we used to melt?
Do you remember how it felt when I touched you?
Oh, 'cause I remember very well

[Bridge]
And how long has it been
Since someone you let in
Has given what I gave to you?
And at night when you sleep
Do you dream I would be there
Just for a minute or two, do you?

[Chorus]
You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

[Chorus 2]
Heartache, heartache, I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
And there is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through with you, oh

[Chorus]
You ain't ever coming back to me
And that's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that
Heartache heartache I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
And there is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through
I called to let you know I'm through
I called to let you know I'm through with you

[Outro]
I ain't ever coming back to you

[Verse 1]
When you refuse me, you confuse me
What makes you think I'll let you in again?
Think again, my friend
Go on, misuse me and abuse me
I'll come out stronger in the end

[Pre-Chorus]
Does it make you sad
To find yourself alone?
Does it make you mad
To find that I have grown?
Bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown

[Chorus]
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home

[Verse 2]
You do not know how much this hurts me
To say these things that I don't wanna say
But have to say them anyway
Oh, I would do anything to end your suffering
But you would rather walk away

[Pre-Chorus]
Does it make you sad
To find yourself alone?
Does it make you mad
To find that I have grown?
Bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown

[Chorus]
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home

[Refrain]
Oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Does it make you sad
To find yourself alone? (Find yourself alone)
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown?
Does it make you sad
To find yourself alone? Yeah
Does it make you mad
To see how I have grown?
Bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown

[Chorus]
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home (Yeah, yeah)
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home (Yeah, oh)
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Thank you!
Goodnight!
Woo!

[Intro]
Oh, uh-huh
Yeah, yeah, oh

[Verse 1]
Where you are seems to be
As far as an eternity
Outstretched arms, open hearts
And if it never ends, then when do we start?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive

[Chorus]
Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back
I have something to say, yeah
How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone
When you get home? (Home)
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I...

[Verse 2]
Dream away every day
Try so hard to disregard
The rhythm of the rain that drops
And coincides with the beating of my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
And I know you'll understand, yeah, yeah, yeah
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever, ever, ever did receive

[Chorus]
Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back
I have something to say, yeah
How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone
When you get home? (Home)
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel, feel, feel, feel

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Pushing forward and arching back (Yeah, oh)
Bring me closer to heart attack (Oh-oh-oh, yeah)

[Outro]
How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone
When you get home? (Home)
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel, feel, feel, feel
(Show you how I feel, show you how I feel, show you, show you how I feel)
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel, feel (Show me, show me, show me)

[Verse 1]
Baby, I don’t wanna spend my life on trial
For something that I did not do
And maybe if you stopped and looked around some time
I wouldn’t pass right by you
Maybe it's because you are so insecure
Maybe you plain don’t care
Maybe it’s the chase that really gets me off
I fall so when it’s just not there

[Pre-Chorus]
Burn another bridge, break another heart
Try again, it will only fall apart

[Chorus]
Infatuation
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
It’s such a shame that you shot me down
It would have been nice to be around
I’m touching your skin
If it’s only a fantasy, then why is it killing me?
I guess this must be infatuation
(I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it)

[Verse 2]
Try to put my finger on what burns me up
It always seems to escape me
And when you have decided that you've had enough
Just tell me where I need to be
Now I'm facing something that I never had
To ever deal with before
She left me with the feeling that she'd had enough
And I'm the one wanting more

[Pre-Chorus]
Burn another bridge, break another heart
Try again, it will only fall apart

[Chorus]
Infatuation
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
It’s such a shame that you shot me down
It would have been nice to be around
I’m touching your skin
If it’s only a fantasy, then why is it killing me?
I guess this must be infatuation
(I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it)

[Bridge]
I'm so attracted to you
The feeling's mutual too
And I get scared the moment you leave
Get so hot, I forget to breathe, yeah

[Chorus]
Infatuation
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
It’s such a shame that you shot me down
It would have been nice to be around
I’m touching your skin
If it’s only a fantasy, then why is it killing me?
I guess this must be infatuation
(I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it)

[Outro]
Ooh (I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it)
Ooh (I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it)
Yeah (I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
You are relentless
I am defenseless
Why did you knock me down tonight?
You beat me senseless
I just don't get this
How many times do I have to try?

[Pre-Chorus]
Your whisper, so clear
The world disappears
As I fall into the darkness
It's impossible to express
How good it feels
I'm wrapped up, I'm sealed
So tired, I'll never be free
All night, don't fight the feeling

[Chorus]
Get back in my life
Come knock on my door
What I'm looking for
I think you should know
You started a fire
Burned me to the floor
Please don't resist anymore
I'll never leave you alone
Oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
You reprimanded
You're so demanding
But I've got time
I don't mind at all (Oh)
You're picture perfect
Completely worth it
You've got my back against the wall (Yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Your whisper, so clear
The world disappears
As I fall into the darkness
It's impossible to express
How good it feels
I'm wrapped up, I'm sealed
So tired, I'll never be free
All night, don't fight the feeling

[Chorus]
Get back in my life
Come knock on my door
What I'm looking for
I think you should know
You started a fire
Burned me to the floor
Please don't resist anymore
I'll never leave you alone

[Bridge]
And can you hear me calling?
I'm screaming, scratching, crawling
You ignore me 'cause I'm always
Coming back to you, coming back to you
And you know how much I miss it
And you know I can't resist it
See your lips and just come running
Right on back to you, right on back to you

[Chorus]
Get back in my life
Come knock on my door
What I'm looking for
I think you should know
You started a fire
Burned me to the floor
I can't do this anymore
I'll never leave you alone

[Outro]
(Get back in my life) Get back in my life (Ooh)
(What I'm looking for) Come on now (I think you should know)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come knock on my door (Oh)
What I'm looking for
I'll never leave you alone
Get back in my life (Oh)
Come scream and scratch on my door
What I'm looking for
I can't do this anymore
Get back in my life (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Come scream and scratch on my door
What I'm looking for
Get back in my life (Get back in my life)
What I'm looking for

[Verse 1]
I’m sick of picking the pieces
And second-guessing
My reasons why you don’t trust me
Why must we do this to one another?
We are just passionate lovers
With trouble under the covers
Nothing worse than when
You know that it’s over

[Chorus]
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead

[Post-Chorus]
Please don’t leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?

[Verse 2]
Well, I’ve got nothing to hide
Dip down and come for a ride
Embrace a devil so sly
You cannot hear 'em coming
‘Cause my defenses are weak
I have no breath left to speak
So take the evidence
And bury it somewhere

[Chorus]
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead

[Post-Chorus]
Please don’t leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?

[Bridge]
Oh my, I don’t mind
Being the other guy
Nice try, for these games
I do not have the time
If you want me, call me
Come and take a risk
Kiss me somewhere deep below the surface

[Chorus]
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead

[Post-Chorus]
Please don’t leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?

[Verse 1]
I didn't hear what you were sayin'
I live on raw emotion, baby
I answer questions, never maybe
And I'm not kind if you betray me
So who the hell are you to say we
Never would have made it, babe?

[Pre-Chorus]
If you needed love, well, then ask for love
Could have given love, now I’m taking love
And it’s not my fault 'cause you both deserve
What's coming now, so don’t say a word

[Chorus]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don’t you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here? I don't think so

[Verse 2]
Would have bled to make you happy
You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you beat me at my own game
And now I find you sleeping soundly
And your lovers screaming loudly
Hear a sound and hit the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
If you needed love, well, then ask for love
Could have given love, now I’m taking love
And it’s not my fault 'cause you both deserve
What's coming now, so don’t say a word

[Chorus]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don’t you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here? I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad

[Bridge]
I'm so sorry, darling
Did I do the wrong thing?
Oh, what was I thinking?
Is his heart still beating?
Oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here? I don't feel so bad
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don’t you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
No, he won't come around here, I don't feel so bad

[Outro]
I don’t feel so bad (Wake up call)
I don’t feel so bad (Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed)
I don’t feel so bad (Don’t you care about me anymore?)
Don’t you care about me? I don't feel so bad
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?

[Verse 1]
I asked her to stay, but she wouldn't listen
And she left before I had the chance to say
Oh, oh
Words that would mend the things that were broken
But now it's far too late; she's gone away

[Pre-Chorus]
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking, "Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?"
Hard to believe that

[Chorus]
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

[Verse 2]
The taste of her breath, I'll never get over
The noises that she made, kept me awake, oh
The weight of things that remained unspoken
Built up so much, it crushed us every day

[Pre-Chorus]
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking, "Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?"
Hard to believe that

[Chorus]
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Of all the things I felt but never really showed
Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go
I should not ever let you go
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

[Outro]
And I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you
I won't go home without you

[Intro]
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
All alone in my room, think of you at a rate that is truly alarming
I keep looping my memories of you in my head
I pretend that you want me
And I fall asleep and dream of alternate realities
And I put myself at ease by pretending that she still loves me

[Chorus]
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You never call, what do I do?
And I can't stop thinking about your love

[Break]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Can't believe I could think that she would just follow me everywhere I go
I just wrestle with you in my dreams and wake up making love to a pillow
And I fall asleep and dream of alternate realities
And I put myself at ease by pretending that she still loves me

[Chorus]
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You never call, what do I do?
And I can't stop, and I can't stop

[Bridge]
What I would give to have you look in my direction
And I'd give my life to somehow attract your attention
And I touch myself like it's somebody else
Thoughts of you are tattooed on my mind
Let me show you

[Chorus]
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You'll never go, what do I do?
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You'll never go, what do I do?
And I can't stop thinking about you

[Intro]
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Danced all night, slept all day
Careless with my heart again
Fearless when it comes to playing games
You don’t cry, you don’t care
Afraid to have a love affair
Is that your ghost or are you really there?

[Chorus]
Now I can’t walk, I can’t talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I’m stuck living out that night again
I’m not falling apart
Ooh, oh

[Verse 2]
Weather on a sunny day
Time slows down; I wish you’d stay
Pass me by in crowded, dark hallways, mm
Try my hardest not to scream
I find my heart is growing weak
So leave your reasons on the bathroom sink

[Chorus]
Now I can't walk, I can't talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I’m stuck living out that night again
I’m not falling apart

[Verse 3]
I heard you say you needed me now
What’s the problem? I can’t see
You destroyed me, I won’t fall apart again
I’m not falling apart
Take what you wanted
I will be just fine
You will be better off alone at night
Waiting and falling
Constantly calling out your name
Will it ever change?

[Chorus]
Now I can’t walk, I can’t talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I’m stuck living out that night again
I’m not falling apart

[Bridge]
I heard you say you needed me now
What’s the problem? I can’t see
You destroyed me, I won’t fall apart again
I’m not falling apart

[Outro]
Oh, ooh

[Verse 1]
You’re such a flirt, I know you hurt
And so do I, I empathize
I see you out, you never cared
A conversation that we never shared
But it’s so strange, it’s something new
Amazing feelings that I have for you
I close my eyes when I’m alone
Wonder what it’d be like to make you moan

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna give you something better
Than anything you’ve ever had
A stronger and a faster lover
The world, it disappears so fast

[Chorus]
Sweet kiwi
Your juices dripping down my chin
So please, let me
Don’t stop it before it begins

[Verse 2]
So give it up, and don’t pretend
And spread your arms and legs across the bed
And when you shake, you won’t regret
The things I whisper in your ear
"What?" I said:

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna give you something better
(You wanna give me something better)
Than anything you’ve ever had
(Than anything I’ve ever had)
A stronger and a faster lover
(A stronger and a faster lover)
The world, it disappears so fast
(It disappears so fast)

[Chorus]
Sweet kiwi
Your juices dripping down my chin
So please, let me
Don’t stop it before it begins

[Verse 3]
I can’t wait to take you home
Fingers through your hair
Kisses on your back
Scratch me with your nails
Save me from myself
Show me how to care
Get everything out
Dripping everywhere
Lipstick smeared all over your face
How much longer must we wait?
Don’t think that I can wait

[Chorus]
Sweet kiwi
Your juices dripping down my chin
So please, let me
Don’t stop it before it begins (Hey, yeah)

[Chorus]
Sweet kiwi (Want to give you something better than this)
Your juices dripping down my chin (Hey, yeah)
So please, let me (Want to give you something better than this)
Don’t stop it before it begins

[Outro]
Don’t stop it before it begins
Don’t stop it before it begins
Don’t stop it before it begins
Don’t stop it before it begins

[Verse 1]
I never knew perfection 'til
I heard you speak, and now it kills me
Just to hear you say the simple things
Now waking up is hard to do
And sleeping is impossible too
Everything's reminding me of you
What can I do?

[Chorus]
It’s not right, not okay
Say the words that you say
Maybe we're better off this way?
I’m not fine, I’m in pain
It’s harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way?
It’s better that we break

[Verse 2]
A fool to let you slip away
I chase you just to hear you say
You're scared and that you think that I'm insane
The city looks so nice from here
Pity I can’' see it clearly
While you're standing there, it disappears
It disappears

[Chorus]
It's not right, not okay
Say the words that you say
Maybe we’re better off this way?
I’m not fine, I’m in pain
It’s harder everyday
Maybe we’re better off this way?
It’s better that we break

[Verse 3]
Saw you sitting all alone
You’re fragile and you’re cold, but that’s all right
Life these days is getting rough
They’ve knocked you down and beat you up
But it’s just a rollercoaster anyway, yeah

[Chorus]
It's not right, not okay
Say the words that you say
Maybe we’re better off this way?
I’m not fine, I’m in pain
It’s harder everyday
Maybe we’re better off this way?
I’m not fine, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe we’re better off this way
I’m not fine, I’m in pain
It’s harder everyday

[Outro]
Maybe we’re better off this way
It’s better that we break, baby

[Verse 1]
From the moment the lights went off
Everything had changed
Lie awake in an empty room
In my head it all feels the same
Like the taste of the day you left
That still lingers on my breath
And the dampness of tears that left
A stain where you had wept
All alone with the negligee
That still hangs off of my bed
I keep meaning to give it away
But I just leave it there instead

[Chorus]
No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

[Verse 2]
Three more days 'til I see your face
I’m afraid it’s far too much
Cook a meal and fix up the place
Dial your number, hang it up
If I took you for granted
I apologize for acting tough
You’re my reason for living
And there’s no way I’m giving up, oh

[Chorus]
No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

[Verse 3]
Now every evening is a bitter fight
And I’m eating home alone on a Friday night
I know what your friends say
"He's just wasting your love and time"
I will never let you change your mind

[Chorus]
No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door
No need to cry about it
I may just die without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

[Outro]
Every time I wind up back at your door
Every time I wind up back at your door

[Verse 1]
This has not been easy
This has been hard
I am scarred
And I do not know what to do with you
Going south, kiss your mouth, lick my lips
Grab your hips, can't remember why I fell in love with this

[Chorus]
But I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh no
You beg me, you ask me to kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again
Oh no, I don't need you

[Verse 2]
Who do you think you are?
No one cares about a name without a face
So don't go shooting up the place (Oh, mm)
Make no mistake, your love's not real
Cause the love that I got is deeper so much deeper than you could ever feel

[Chorus]
And I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh no
You beg me, you ask me to kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again, oh no
'Cause I don't need you tonight

[Bridge]
It was really nice to know you
I got nothing left to show you
Got bills to pay, get out my way, it's time to move on
And dinner with your boyfriend will never be the same again
Discuss me over cigarettes and say to him

[Chorus]
I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh no
You beg me, you ask me
To kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again
'Cause oh no, 'cause I don't need you
And I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh no
You beg me, you ask me
To kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again
'Cause oh no, I don't need you

[Verse 1]
It's so hard to find you
I'm standing right behind you
The streets are much colder
This mean I'm getting older
Why would you? How could I?
These questions lead to goodbye
But now I got my freedom
Don't I?

[Chorus]
I parked my car outside your house
Hope that someday you'll come home
Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I finally found a way to be alone
I'm terrified to think that I may be losing my mind

[Verse 2]
Shy girl, so humble
With eyes that make me stumble
Somehow not speaking lets me know everything
I go out, You eat in
Hot from the situation
You're naked in daylight
Wrap yourself up and goodnight
I'm burning, I'm hungry
Angry ‘cause she don't love me
You got me completely
In my own game you beat me

[Chorus]
I parked my car outside your house
Hope that someday you'll come home
Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I finally found a way to be alone
I'm terrified to think that I may be losing my mind

[Bridge]
I will be back again
No this is not the end
I've fallen hard this time but I not giving in
I want the world to know that I won't let you forget
The tears that you shed
I'll make it impossible to let go

[Chorus]
I parked my car outside your house
Hope that someday you'll come home
Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I finally found a way to be alone
I'm terrified to think that I may be losing my mind
I parked my car outside your house
Hope that someday you'll come home
Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I finally found a way to be alone
I'm terrified to think that I may be losing my mind

[Verse 1]
This relationship is over
Though my stomach still hurts
And now I'm gonna live alone
Why is the pain much worse?
You're so much better without makeup
Why would you hide your face?
Don't want to spend the night and wake up
Realize I've made a big mistake, oh

[Chorus]
I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight (Oh)
My heart beats fast, I know you're there
And I pretend like I don't care (Oh)
It hurts so bad to know the truth
But I am still in love with you

[Verse 2]
I never meant to keep you waiting
And now your food is getting cold
I keep denying I'm in love with you
My routine is getting old
And now you stand in front of the table
And say you never look back
Do something stupid when you're angry
You only wake up sad, oh

[Chorus]
I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight (Oh)
My heart beats fast I know you're there
And I pretend like I don't care (Oh)
It hurts so bad to know the truth
But girl, I'm still in love with you
It hurts too much to know the truth
But girl, I'm still in love with you

[Bridge]
No more kisses on your lips and tender touches, please
I'd rather die on my two feet than live down on my knees
And all the cuts you gave me open up and start to bleed
And I just can’t get over you, until you're over me

[Chorus]
I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight (Oh)
My heart beats fast I know you're there
And I pretend like I don't care (Oh)
And I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight (Oh)
My heart beats fast, I know you're there
And I pretend like I don't care (Oh)
It hurts so bad to know the truth
But girl, I'm still in love with you (Oh)
It hurts so much to know the truth
But girl, I'm still in love with you (Oh)

[Verse 1]
I'm happy you came to me first
Before the bubble burst
I'm happy you answered my calls
I'm bouncing off the walls
Impossible to be tamed
Her need; cellophane
I'm happy you like to play games
Why did you run away?

[Chorus]
We could spend some time together
What he had, he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see your getting it
So let’s figure it out, let's go

[Verse 2]
I'm happy you're so impulsive
Means that you're passionate
I’m happy you're moving so fast
But will it ever last?
I know you wanna break free
From this monotony
I'm happy you're coming with me
But by choice it’s gotta be

[Chorus]
We could spend some time together
What he has, he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see you're getting it
So let’s figure it out, let's go

[Verse 3]
I'm happy you're changing your speed
Slow down and lay with me
On bottom but always discrete
Kneel down and kiss her feet
I'm happy you’re going too far
Full strength before we start
Sometimes you make it so hard
Scream loud as we come apart

[Chorus]
We can spend some time together
What he had he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see you're getting it
So figure it out, let's go
We can spend some time together
What he has he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see you're getting it
So figure it out, let's go
Figure it out, let's go
Figure it out, let's go
Figure it out, let's... go

[Intro]
I really, I really (Whoa)
I really need to know
I really, I really (Whoa)
Or else, you gotta let me go, oh
I really, I really

[Verse 1]
This time I really need to do things right
Shivers that you give me keep me freezing all night
You make me shudder, oh yeah
I can't believe it, I'm not myself
Suddenly I'm thinking about no one else
You make me shudder

[Pre-Chorus]
I really, I really need to know
Or else you gotta let me go, oh

[Chorus]
You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I give you everything
Pay some attention to me
All I want is just you and me always
Give me affection
I need your perfection
'Cause you feel so good
You make me stutter, stutter (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
If I could touch you, I'd never let go
Now you got me screaming, and I cannot shut up
Oh, shut up, yeah
Now I am lying on the bedroom floor
Barely even speaking and I cannot get up

[Pre-Chorus]
And I really, I really, I really need to know
Or else you gotta let me go, oh

[Chorus]
You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I give you everything
Pay some attention to me
All I want is just you and me always
Give me affection
I need your perfection
'Cause you feel so good
You make me stutter, stutter, stutter

[Bridge]
You knock me down, I can't get up, I'm stuck
Gotta stop shaking me up
I can't eat, can't sleep, can't think
Sinking under, I'm sinking under

[Chorus]
You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I give you everything
Pay some attention to me
All I want is you and me always
You're just a fantasy girl (You're just a fantasy girl)
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
Give me affection, I need your perfection (Oh yeah)
'Cause it feels so good, you make me stutter (I really, I really)
You make me stutter (I really, I really)
You make me stutter

[Intro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Living inside my head
Pulling my strings
Letting me think I'm in control
Giving you all of my heart
Was a good start
But it turns out you want my soul

[Chorus]
I don't know nothing about that
In fact I don't know nothing at all
I'm tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong
So tell me what you really want
'Cause I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be alone

[Break]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh (Uh)

[Verse 2]
Pushing me over the edge
Can't forget those things you said
Cut to the bone
Go ahead, take your swing
What did you think?
I was just going to roll over? Oh no

[Chorus]
I don't know nothing about that
In fact I don't know nothing at all
I'm tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong
Gotta tell me what you really want
'Cause I don't wanna be
Oh, I don't want to be alone

[Break]
Ooh-ooh-ooh (Alone)
Ooh (Alone)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I don't wanna be

[Verse 3]
I've put myself on the line
I'm tired of wasting my time
There's got to be a reason why
She will not talk to me, no oh

[Chorus]
I don't know nothing about that
In fact I don't know nothing at all
So tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong
I don't know nothing about that
In fact I don't know nothing at all
So tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong

[Bridge]
Tell me what you really want
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be alone

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Intro]
Ooh (Ah, la la la la la la la)
Ooh (Ah, la la la la la la la)

[Verse 1]
I must have been a fool
To love you so hard for so long
So much stronger than before
But so much harder to move on
And now the bitter chill of the winter
Still blows through me like a plague
Only to wake up with an empty bed
On a perfect summer day (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
My world just feels so cold
And you find yourself
Walking down the wrong side of the road (Ooh)

[Chorus]
I can't lie, you're on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heartbeat like yesterday

[Verse 2]
I never did my best to express how I really felt
And now that I know exactly what I want
You found somebody else (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
And my world just feels so cold
And you find yourself
Walking down the wrong side of the road (Oh yeah)

[Chorus]
I can't lie, you're on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heartbeat like yesterday

[Post-Chorus]
(Ah, la la la la la la la) Yeah
(Ah, la la la la la la la) Yeah yeah
(Ah, la la la la la la la) Oh
(Ah, la la la la) Yeah, oh

[Bridge]
My world just feels so cold
And I find myself
Thinking about the things I could have done
And it warms my soul
When you let me know
I'm not the only one

[Chorus]
I can't lie, you're on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday
I can't lie, you're on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday
I can't lie, you're on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday

[Intro]
Put your hands, all over, put your hands all over me
Put your hands, all over, put your hands all over me
(Put your hands all over me)

[Verse 1]
I can't seem to find the pretty little face I left behind
Wandered out on the open road
Looking for a better place to call home
Gave her a place to stay, and she got up and ran away
Well, now I've had enough
Her pretty little face has torn me up

[Chorus]
Put your hands all over me
Please talk to me, talk to me
Tell me everything is gonna be alright
Put your hands all over me
Please walk with me, walk with me now
Love is a game you say
Play me and put me away (Put your hands all over me)

[Verse 2]
Now you've lost your mind
The pretty little girl I left behind
And now you're getting rough
But everybody knows you're not that tough
Wandered out on the open road
Looking for a place to call your own
Scared to death of the road ahead
Pretty little thing, don't get upset

[Chorus]
Put your hands all over me
Please talk to me, talk to me
Tell me everything is gonna be alright
Put your hands all over me
Please walk with me, walk with me now
Love is a game you say, play me and put me away
Love is a game you say, play me and put me away
Put your hands all over me (Ooh-ooh)
(Woo) Put your hands all over me (Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah) Put your hands all over me (Ooh-ooh)
All over me

[Bridge]
So come down off your cloud
Say it now say it loud
Get up in my face
Pretty little girl, come make my day

[Chorus]
Put your hands all over me
Please talk to me, talk to me (Oh)
Put your hands all over me
Now walk with me, walk with me now
Put your hands all over me
Gotta talk to me, talk to me
Come on now, babe
Put your hands all over me
Gotta walk with me, walk with me now
Love is a game you say, play me and put me away
Love is a game you say, play me and put me away
Put your hands all over me
Yeah (All over me)

[Outro]
Put your hands, all over
Put your hands all over me

[Verse 1]
I have been searching for your touch
Unlike any touch I've ever known
And I never thought about you much
Till I'm broken down and all alone (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Though I don't understand the meaning of love
I do not mind if I die trying (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Took it for granted when you lifted me up

[Chorus]
I'm asking for your help
I am going through hell
Afraid nothing can save me but the sound of your voice
You cut out all the noise
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly now
I'd kill if I could take you back
But how?
But how?

[Verse 2]
I can feel it in my guts
What's going on with him now?
And don't patronize me with lies
I'm a man, be a woman now (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I have been bound by the shackles of love
And I don't mind if I die tied up (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Took it for granted when you lifted me up

[Chorus]
I'm asking for your help
I am going through hell
Afraid nothing can save me but the sound of your voice
You cut out all the noise
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly now
I'd kill if I could take you back
But how?
But how?
But how?
But how?
Oh, yeah

[Bridge]
Why must we be so ugly?
And please do not think ill of me
Why does the one you love
Become the one who makes you want to cry
Why?
Why?
Why?
(And how? How?)

[Outro]
But I don't understand the meaning of love
I do not mind if I die trying
I do not mind if I die trying
I do not mind if I die trying

[Verse 1]
What am I supposed to do with this time?
If there's so many holes, I stay afloat
But I feel out of control
So petrified, I'm petrified, mm
What am I supposed to do to get by?
Did I lose everything I need to survive?
'Cause at 4 AM, when the sweat sets in
Did you get my message? Did it send?
Or did you just get on with your life?
Oh

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm taking time to think and I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around
And run away, run away

[Verse 2]
What am I supposed to do with these clothes? (Oh)
It's my twisted way of keeping you close (Yeah, yeah)
I'm a nervous wreck, I'm a broken man
Did you get my message? Did it send?
Or do you get along on your own?

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm taking time to think and I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around
And run away, run away

[Bridge]
And it breaks me down when I see your face
You look so different but you feel the same
And I do not understand
I cannot comprehend
The chills your body sends
Why did it have to end?

[Chorus]
I'm taking time to think and I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around
And run away, run away
Oh, I'm taking time to think and I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around
And run away, run away

[Outro]
Runaway, runaway (Runaway)
Turn around and
Runaway, runaway (Runaway)
Runaway, runaway (Runaway)
But I can't tell you if you
Runaway, runaway (Runaway)
Turn around and runaway (Runaway)

[Intro: Adam Levine]
Mm, yeah

[Verse 1: Adam Levine, Lady A, Both]
Tell me actions speak louder
But there's something about her words
That hurt
Closing up, it's so late and
I'm the last one still waiting for ya to lock the door
On our way home, I realize
There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes
Only veiled by a thin disguise

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Now that I've done my time
I need to move on and I need you to try

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Lady A]
'Cause we're out of goodbyes
We're out of goodbyes
Out of goodbyes

[Verse 2: Adam Levine & Lady A]
Never asked you to change
But sadly you don't feel the same
About me
I wonder, does your man still shudder
When you touch his hand?
Like this man

[Bridge: Adam Levine & Lady A]
And on our way home I realize
There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes
Only veiled by a thin disguise

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine & Lady A]
Now that I've done my time
I need to move on and I need you to try

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Lady A, (Lady A)]
'Cause we're out of goodbyes
We're out of goodbyes (We're out of goodbyes)
We're out of goodbyes (We're out of goodbyes)
Oh, ooh-ooh
(Mm, oh-oh)

[Verse 1]
I'm sure that he could give you everything
Stability and diamond rings
All the things I do not have
I understand you can't handle that
But for everything that I lack
I provide something you almost had
Hot flesh that you yearn to grab
Pit of your stomach, you're still so sad

[Chorus]
Ooh, what you gonna do?
I'm in love with you
Don't you wanna dance?
This may be the last chance (Last chance)
That I get (I get) to love you (To love you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Out of sight, not out of mind
You want the world, I'll give you mine
'Cause you're the girl I'll never find
And I'm the boy you've left behind, whoa
I know you think you're satisfied
And God knows how hard we try
But if you showed up at my door (Ooh)
I could give you so much more, oh

[Chorus]
Ooh, what you gonna do?
I'm in love with you
Don't you wanna dance?
This may be the last chance (Last chance)
That I get (I get) to love you (To love you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, what am I gonna do?
I don't like to lose
You're not making sense
This may be the last chance (Last chance)
That you get (You get) to love me (Love me)
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
Oh, you sure don't make it easy to get myself to safety
You tell me that I'm crazy
But you're the one who makes me this way
You call yourself impulsive
But that's what makes us so explosive

[Verse 3]
So as I burn these photographs
I wonder if you kept the ones you have
Keep them locked up somewhere safe
'Cause it's the only place you'll see my face

[Chorus]
Ooh, what you gonna do?
I'm in love with you
Why don't you wanna dance?
'Cause this may be the last chance (Last chance)
That I get (I get) to love you (To love you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, what am I gonna do?
I don't like to lose
You're not making sense
'Cause this may be the last chance (Last chance)
That you get (You get) to love me (Love me)
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Outro]
'Cause this may be the last chance (Last chance)
That I get (I get) to love you (Love you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
To love you (Love you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
You say you need someone
But everybody does
I'm no different than you
I just believe what I do
You point your finger at
Everyone but yourself
And blame the ones that you love
Who're only tryin' to help

[Pre-Chorus]
As it's winding down to zero
I am your unlikely hero
I'll see this through
There's so much me and you
Take this enemy together
Fight these demons off forever
Forever, forever, forever

[Chorus]
Five, four, three, two, one
I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all

[Verse 2]
I have no time for fear
Or people in my ear
Head down and running so fast
Try not to dwell on the past
I'm fighting through this pain
And things I cannot change
Running right into the flames
Rather than running away

[Pre-Chorus]
As it's winding down to zero
I am your unlikely hero
I'll see this through
There's so much me and you
Take this enemy together
Fight these demons off forever
Forever, forever, forever

[Chorus]
Five, four, three, two, one
I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all

[Bridge]
Sweat drips down from every angle
Love your body as it gathers in a pool by your feet
You turn up the heat
Tossing and turning, you cannot sleep
Quietly weep, you're in too deep

[Chorus]
Five, four, three, two, one
I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all
Five, four, three, two, one
I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all

[Verse 1]
People never change
They seem to stay the same
They wear different clothes
But play the same games
Many different ways
To say the same thing
Searching for the right words
The ones that would make you stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Exchanging the way things were
For the way that they should be, yeah
And choosing these words
Is saying to her
The things that she never heard
But always deserved

[Chorus]
I figured out what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
You're everything
The air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry

[Verse 2]
Oh, I'm not even really sure
Who made this mess
And who threw what punch
But I could not care less
All I know is that I'm here
And you are not, oh
Once I put this wasted pride aside
Nothing’s all I got, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Exchanging the way things were
For the way that they should be, yeah
And choosing these words
Is saying to her
The things that she never heard
But always deserved

[Chorus]
I figured out what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
You're everything
The air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry

[Bridge]
Oh
Somebody make it stop
Yeah
And pick me up
And just dust me off, oh
The rainy day flood
Will drown all this love
Trapped at the bottom now
Please dig me up

[Chorus]
I figured out what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
You're everything
The air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry (Yeah)
I figured out what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
You're everything
The air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry (Yeah, ooh)

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, hmm, hmm, hmm

[Verse 1]
I am so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is alright with me
'Cause you make me feel so brand new
I wanna spend my life with you
The same thing's, baby
Since we've been together, mmm
Loving you forever
Is what I need
Let me be the one you come running to
Baby, baby
I'll never be untrue, baby
Ooh, baby
Let's, ought to stay together (baby)

[Chorus]
Loving you, whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
Come on

[Break]
Oh oh, oh
Oh oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Whether times are good are bad, happy or sad
Come on
Why, somebody, why people break up? Oh
Turn around and make up
I just can't see
'Cause you'd never do that to me, baby
Would you, baby?
Being around you is all I see, yeah
Ooh baby, let's, we ought to stay together

[Chorus]
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
Come on

[Verse 3]
Let's babe, ought to stay together, baby
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
Come on
Good or bad, happy or sad
Come on, good or bad
Happy or sad

[Outro]
Oh, oh

[Intro]
You have been gone for so long
Don't know if you're ever coming back
All I know is if you ever come around again

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, it's so cold
Where you are
Another chilly winter in New York
Cold; where you are
Another chilly winter in New York

[Verse 1]
I get so hungry
But what I got is not enough
Don't got any money
No fancy car and no sexy scars
But I, I do have something
That you want
And I'll love you till I crumble to the ground

[Chorus]
You have been gone for so long
Don't know if you're ever coming back
All I know is if you ever come around again

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, it's so cold
Where you are
Another chilly winter in New York
Cold; where you are
Another chilly winter in New York

[Chorus]
You have been gone for so long
Don't know if you're ever coming back
All I know is if you ever come around again

[Outro]
Baby, it's so cold
Where you are
Another chilly winter in New York
Cold; where you are
Another chilly winter in New York

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
I won't let anyone hurt you
And I'll stop them if they try to
Nobody knows you like I do, baby
And I don't care where you run to
Because I'm gonna find you
When the stars all align
We can try again

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Is anybody out there? (whoa)
Can anybody see? (whoa)
Seems like everything is going crazy (whoa)
You're exactly what I wanted (whoa)
And exactly what I need (whoa)
Don't need nobody but my baby

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
So where did all your love go
You play me like a solo
Then you threw my broken heart away, yeah
I know that we can make it
And I know that you can feel me
So stop fooling around and just stay

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Is anybody out there? (whoa)
Can anybody see? (whoa)
Seems like everything is going crazy (whoa)
You're exactly what I wanted (whoa)
And exactly what I need (whoa)
Don't need nobody but my baby

[Verse 3: PJ Morton]
It's taken such a long time
To find what I've been looking for
And now that you are all mine
I never felt quite like this before
Still want more
All you need in my mind
Because if so, then you already know
You're all that I want and you're all that I needed

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Is anybody out there? (whoa)
Can anybody see? (whoa)
Seems like everything is going crazy (whoa)
You're exactly what I wanted (whoa)
And exactly what I need (whoa)
Don't need nobody but my baby
Is anybody out there? (whoa)
Can anybody see? (whoa)
Seems like everything is going crazy (whoa)
You're exactly what I wanted (whoa)
And exactly what I need (whoa)
Don't need nobody but my baby

[Verse 1]
How ya feelin'?
The day has had its way with both of us
And oh, I've gone out of my way
But I'm not free
From this pain I'm reelin'
I was a fool to think someday
You would come around
But no, no, no
I'm not thinking that way

[Interlude]
'Cause now I see
You are not what you seem
You are a mystery to me
Sometimes I just wanna scream

[Chorus]
I think you should just go away 'cause
There's no necessity for you to stay and
Next time you come around my way
Forget it, baby
You're not coming in

[Verse 2]
How's your day been? (Yeah)
'Cause mine has taken strange and ugly turns
But no, no, no
I feel better today
'Cause I'm off my knees

[Interlude]
You are not what you seem
You are a mystery to me
Sometimes I just wanna scream, yeah

[Chorus]
I think you should just go away 'cause
There's no necessity for you to stay and
Next time you come around my way
Forget it, baby
You're not coming in
A hot minute for a life of sorrow
No, you can't come back tomorrow
Shut my windows, lock my doors
'Cause my heart won't be your ragdoll anymore (Yeah)

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I think you should just go away 'cause
There's no necessity for you to stay and
Next time you come around my way
Forget it, baby
You're not coming in
A hot minute for a life of sorrow
No, you can't come back tomorrow
Shut my windows, lock my doors
'Cause my heart won't be your ragdoll anymore (Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, yeah, oh oh oh, oh, yeah yeah, oh oh, oh, oh)
'Cause my heart won't be your ragdoll anymore

[Verse 1]
Do you mean all the things you are?
Are you pleased with the way things are?
Wear that dress to protect this scar
That only I have seen
Do you give just to please yourself?
Do you wish you were somewhere else?
Justified all the things you tried
Said that it was all for me

[Chorus]
And be near
Just for the moment
Stay here
Never go home
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes, the story of a broken heart comes true
It comes true

[Verse 2]
Have you learned all the secrets yet?
Will you burn by the things I've said?
Took the dive just to feel alive
But never heard the truth
Now I'm in love but I don't know how
I'm in pain 'cause I want it now
As I sit watching her eyes close
I slowly open mine

[Chorus]
And be near
Just for the moment
Stay here
Never go home
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes, the story of a broken heart comes true
It comes true

[Verse 3]
I am so confused by this
I know that life is hit or miss
Days are stung by too much sun
I think that you may be the one
Cover yourself up in me
Shrouded in what could have been
I will listen to your pain
If you listen to me

[Chorus]
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes, as the story of a broken heart comes true
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
And I know, the story of a broken heart comes true

[Outro]
Comes true
True
It comes true
True

[Verse 1]
Making love to a picture frame
One more time tonight
You can tell by the lines in her smile
Something is not right

[Pre-Chorus]
Where are you hiding? (Hiding)
She's on the outside
I'm on the inside crying (Crying)
Just another crazy boy
Hungry for your

[Chorus]
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and I'm filled up
Never need to go back to the way I was
The way I was

[Verse 2]
I tried and tried and tried and tried
But I have no concept of consequence
And I'm a master of self defense
Days get longer
Life gets shorter
She rips me like no other
So oh dripping from head to toe

[Pre-Chorus]
Where are you hiding? (Hiding)
She's on the outside
I'm on the inside crying (Crying)

[Chorus]
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and I'm filled up
Never need to go back to the way I was
The way I was
The way I was
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and I'm filled up
Never need to go back to the way I was
The way I was

[Verse 3]
I can't make the same mistake
If you lose my love
It was yours to take
Break down your door
Take a little more
When I need you around
And I'm so terrified of leaving
It's a new low
Try and pick me up again, but
Let go see how far I get without you
Desperately need more of your

[Chorus]
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and I'm filled up
Never need to go back to the way I was
The way I was
Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and I'm filled up
Never need to go back to the way I was
The way I was

[Verse 1]
If I be so inclined to climb up beside you
Would you tell me that the time just isn't right?
And if I should ever find the key you hide so well
Will you tell me that I can spend the night?

[Chorus 1]
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman

[Verse 2]
If I could bottle up the chills that you give me
I would keep them in a jar next to my bed
And If I should ever draw a picture of a woman
It is you that would come flowing from my pen

[Chorus 1]
Leaving the clothes on the floor
Making me walk out the door
And I still fail to understand what it is about this woman
Fail to understand what it is about this woman

[Verse 3]
Helplessly melting as I stand next to the sun
As she burns me, I am screaming out for more
Drink every drop of liquid heat that I've become
Pop me open, spill me out onto the floor

[Chorus 1]
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand, fail to understand
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman

[Verse 1]
It really was a meeting
The bottle took a beating
The ladies of the manor
Watched me climb into my car and I was
Going down the track about a hundred and five
They had the stopwatch rolling
I had the headlights blazing I was really alive
And yet my mind was blowing
I drank a bottle of tequila and I felt real good
I had the tape deck roaring
But on the twenty-fifth lap at the canal turn
I went off exploring

[Chorus]
I knew I wouldn’t make it the car just couldn’t take it
I was turning the tires burning
The ground was in my sky
I was laughing the bitch was trashed
And death was in my eye

[Verse 2]
I had started pretty good and I was feeling my way
I had the wheels in motion
There was Peter and the Greenfly laughing like drains
Inebriation
The crowd was roaring I was at Brands Hatch
In my imagination
But at the canal turn I hit an oily patch
Inebriation

[Chorus]
I knew I wouldn’t make it the car just couldn’t take it
I was turning the tires burning
The ground was in my sky
I was laughing the bitch was trashed
And death was in my eye

[Bridge]
Mr. Miracle, you saved me from some pain
I thank you Mr. Miracle, I won’t get trashed again
Can you hear my lies
Don’t you bother with this fool just laugh into my eyes

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I was turning the tires burning
The ground was in my sky
I was laughing the bitch was trashed
And death was in my eye

[Bridge]
Mr. Miracle, you saved me from some pain
I thank you Mr. Miracle, I won’t get trashed again
Can you hear my lies
Don’t you bother with this fool just laugh into my eyes

[Verse 3]
So we went back to the bar and hit the bottle again
But there was no tequila
Then we started on the whiskey just to steady our brains
‘Cause there was no tequila
And as we drank a little faster at the top of our hill
We began to roll
And as we got trashed we were laughing still
Bless my soul

[Verse 1]
Accept the fact that your second rate life is easy for you
It's all served up on a gold plated plate
And we don't even have to talk to you
Your face is normal, that's the way you're bred
And that's the way you're going to stay
Your head is firmly nailed to your TV channel
But someone else's finger's on the control panel

[Chorus]
What you gonna be, what you gonna be brother?
Zero the hero
Don't you wanna be, don't you wanna be brother?
Zero the hero
When you gonna be, when you gonna be brother?
Zero the hero
Impossibility, impissibolity, mother
Really a hero

[Verse 2]
You sit there, watch it all burn down
It's easy and breezy for you
You play your life to a different sound
No edge, no edge, you got no knife have you
Your life is a six lane highway to nowhere
You're going so fast you're never ever gonna get down there
Where the heroes sit by the river
With a magic in their music as they eat raw liver

[Chorus]
What you gonna be, what you gonna be brother?
Zero the hero
Don't you wanna be, don't you wanna be brother?
Zero the hero
When you gonna be, when you gonna be brother?
Zero the hero
Impossibility, impissibolity, mother
Really a hero

[Verse 3]
You stand there captain, and we all look
You really are mediocre
You are the champion in the Acme form book
But I think you're just a joker
Your freedom life ain't so much of a pity
But the luv-a-ducking way you're walking around
The city with your balls and your head full of nothing
It's easy for you sucker, but you really need stuffing

[Chorus]
What you gonna be, what you gonna be brother?
Zero the hero
Don't you wanna be, don't you wanna be brother?
Zero the hero
When you gonna be, when you gonna be brother?
Zero the hero
Impossibility, impossibility, mother
Really a hero
She wears her leather just to satisfy
She really throws it around
There ain't one thing she can't afford to buy
She's the richest bitch in town

Her big fat daddy was a money machine
He made a fortune from computers
She's got more money than I've ever seen
But she's a greedy emotional looter

Keep away from the digital bitch
Keep away from the digital bitch
Keep away from the digital bitch
She's so rich the digital bitch

She's got five rollers and a fine estate
A big house upon hill
She throws parties just to celebrate
Her life is just one ginormous thrill

She buys poor people just to have around
She has a trophy for each lover
The bitch is rich but baby pound for pound
She's got a lot more to discover
Keep away from the digital bitch
Keep away from the digital bitch
Keep away from the digital bitch
She's so rich the digital bitch

Maybe she could please me if I saw beneath her veil
But she's just imitation woman up for sale

She got so famous that she's on TV
She's got a real professional smile
But I switch over 'cos she ain't for me
She disturbs me all the while

She looks so happy but she's got it wrong
She's always going faster
She sings her life to such a different song
She needs a loving and dominant master

Keep away from the digital bitch
Keep away from the digital bitch
Keep away from the digital bitch
She's so rich the digital bitch
As you look through my window
Deep into my room
At the tapestries all faded
Their vague and distant glories
Concealed in the gloom
The icy fingers of forgotten passions
Softly brushing my lips
At the tips of my primitive soul

As you look through my door
Deep into my room
Can you feel the mighty wall of power
It's waiting waiting in the glow
The distant shadows of forgotten champions
Those who live in me still
And will rise when we challenge and kill

Born again
You'll be born again

Look at this prince of evil
Fighting for your mind
Fighting all priests of shame
For the thrust of my challenge is aimed
At the hearts of mutant gods
Who think we're all the same
They're controlling our minds
And they use us for fortune and fame
As you look through my window
Deep into my room
At your future and freedom
The grey and plastic retards all floating in circles
And as you taste the fruits of new sensations
Softly brushing your lips
As we rise when we challenge and kill

Born again
You'll be born again

Born again
You'll be born again
If you want to be a king for a day
Just do what I say

Born again
You'll be born again
Everybody's got to think like a hunter
Just search for your prey

Born again
You'll be born again
Be alive through the night and the day
Just do it my way
Take me to the river baby drink my wine
When I'm going down won't you throw me a line
Lead me to religion take me up them stairs
When I take a tumble will you say me some prayers

When will you show me a sign
When will you throw me a line

Help me to the answer baby set me free
I'm torn between the devil and the deep blue sea
Maybe if you wanted you could save my face
Keep me out of trouble and I'm living disgrace

Show me to a sucker and you'll see my name
Standing in a line with the shadows of fame
Lead me to a legend take me up them stairs
When I take a tumble will you say me some prayers
Sweet woman are you feeling right
What was it that you did last night
You made me crazy you made me fly
I can't forget the hungry look in your eye
What's the matter with me?
I'm just a runner I was born free
But since I met you I can't leave you alone
I'm leaving now but I'll be coming home

Keep it warm rat the place by your side
Nobody's gonna take away our magical ride
Keep it warm for when we talk on the phone
Don't forget will you pretty one that your man is coming home

D'you hear the rumour that is going around
Say I'm ruined 'cos I've settled down
It's not true well maybe half and half
You know I love you but I still like a laugh
I'm feeling fine I got it right for the first time
Sweet woman I can't stay for long but everybody will be prove wrong
I'm like a gypsy I need to roam
But don't worry I'll be coming home
I need the danger I need the thrill
I need to know what is over each hill
I'm a different man I'm still running but you understand
Since I met you I can't leave you alone
I'm leaving now but I'll be coming home
Thunder shattered the dawn
Raging with fury, the king has come
The power of terror will reign
There is no mercy in pleading

In for the kill, no quarter be shown
Live for the thrill of battle alone
Blessed by the will to die for the throne
In for the kill
In for the kill

Freedom is taken by storm
The blood on his hands is still running warm
The power of terror will reign
There is no mercy in pleading

In for the kill, no quarter be shown
Live for the thrill of battle alone
Blessed by the will to die for the throne
In for the kill
For the kill
In for the kill, no quarter be shown
Live for the thrill of battle alone
Blessed by the will to die for the throne
In for the kill
In for the kill

Thunder shattered the dawn
Raging with fury, the king has come
Death and destruction riding the storm
Blood on his hands still running warm
In for the kill
The king has come

[Verse 1]
Cold is the night
Lonely till dawn
Cry for the light
For the love that won't come
You said that you'd never
Leave me alone

[Verse 2]
I gave you my heart
You cried for my soul
An Angel won't come
This Devil won't go
Something is wrong
I just can't get away

[Chorus]
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love
Why can't you see I'm no stranger to love
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love
But I'm a stranger in your arms
Yes, I'm a stranger in your arms

[Verse 3]
Maybe it's right
But I just can't understand
The hurt that I feel
For my love second hand
I know I should leave
But I just can't walk away

[Chorus]
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love
Why can't you see I'm no stranger to love
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love
I'm a stranger in your arms
Yes, I'm a stranger in your arms

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love
Why can't you see I'm no stranger to love
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love
I'm a stranger in your arms
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love
Why can't you see I'm no stranger to love
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love
Why can't you see I'm no stranger to love
She came from the past
She was never meant to last
Her destiny was fatal
From the start
A messenger from hell
She cast a deadly spell
On all of those who dare
To cross her heart
Ain't no use in you trying to run
Fate has taken it's toll
Just one look and the damage is done
Burn your eyes
Turn your heart into stone
History foretold of a circle
Cast in gold
An evil seed of power
Sealed within
But fate has lent a hand
Destroyed the golden band
And freed her soul
To wash the land with sin
Ain't no use in you trying to run
Fate has taken it's toll
Just one look and the damage is done
Burn your eyes
Turn your heart into stone
She cast a deadly spell
She put a spell on you
She's got evil in her heart
Turn your heart into stone
Turn your heart into stone
There's a vision in the sands
Rising from the ancient past
Crying let my spirit go
Lead my burning soul to rest

Hear the sound of distant ages
It's the call of the seventh star

There's no shelter from the heat
There's no mercy from this land
Hear a thousand chanting souls
Waiting judgement from God's hand

Hear the sound of distant ages
It's the call of the seventh star
Hear the sound of fallen angels
It's the call of the seventh star

The pyramids will fall
Turn to dust before the sun
And the star will rise again
Until destiny is done
Hear the sound of distant ages
It's the call of the seventh star
Hear the sound of fallen angels
It's the call of the seventh star

[Intro: Kanye West]
I just got off the plane, Chicago
It's ya boy Kanye West on the beat
Ay, White Boy

[Hook 2x: Kanye West and John Legend]

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Kanye the best in the game, now we got that, that thing clear

Y'all need to change y'all tone, nigga, I control the 'go
Motherfucker close the do', light the weed and let the douja blow
Why you keep bawlin' though girl, you ain't been around niggas before?
Why my chain rosey gold, why my wrist below zero?
How the hell I know B-Lo, why them girls tell you no means no?
No means no just as sure as green means go
Green means paper, dream team caper
We see haters like shorty on the 'Sixth Sense'
Y'all finna' see some dead people

My people ain't scared people, only FIG-I-AIR people

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Whiteboy]
White Boy back in the mix and I'm in the atmosphere

Y'alls flow hot like March, y'all can't stop these bars
White Boy drop these charts, White Boy got the ball
Lyrics gon' shock you all, Cris gon' cop them cars
Get a couple foxy broads, out they shoes socks and bra

Pimp wit' a monster walk, Cris got hostile thoughts
Y'all better watch it dawg, me and West rock you dawg

[Hook 2x]

[B-Lo]
Rap profit, plat Gothic, slash convict raps jock it, phat

Droppin' cakes, stoppin' wakes, knockin' hate
And you fakes, watchin' base, on relate
Gossip fakes and I make, opt, yeah
In case I catch a case gots to pay, confrentrate
Need ya way, from this place cause it ain't common (nope)
If this ain't the way, Kanye, then it's straight
Colleges in ya veins cause you spit what you came from
Straight knowledge, I was raised in the street
Praised in my heat, holdin' on my Nextel
Hopin' for the next cell, focused on the best cell
Smokin' on a fresh L, posted like FedEx mail

[Hook 2x]

[Intro]
Does it feel good?

Does it feel good?

[Verse 1]
If I told you that I love you, would you run away?
Or would you run to me?
I need to know it, babe
If I gave you all my lovin', would you give it back?
What would you do with that?
I ask a lot of that
And if I gave you all my time when it’s the summertime
And all my downtime

If I’m fallin over you, then what you gonna do?
I wanna come with you

If I partied 'til the morning, would you stay with me?
Girl, would you play with me?
Or would you hate on me?
If I ran all out of money, would you pay for me?
Or would you stray from me?
I need to know it, babe
If there's something I could do to make you see the light
Girl, that I'll treat you right
I'd do it every night
Every second that I'm with you, it's a special world
Like I'm your only man
And you're my only girl

[Chorus]
I give you all my lovin' to you
I give you all my lovin' to you

[Intro]
Oh, damn!
Oh, damn! (Oh damn!)
Ooh, damn! (Damn!)
Ooooh, damn!

[Verse 1]
Girl you know I’m looking at you
Something like an angel when you’re walking on by
Sexy from the front, a-ha
Sexy from the back, a-ha
Grab my cardiac, oh my...
Give a boy a heart attack call the ambulance
Girl I fell in love, a-ha
Give the boy a chance
And you know I would

[Pre-Chorus]
I can’t stop girl
Every time you walking down the block
Girl talking tender lovely
You’re so hot girl, ooooh
Girl, I go stupid for you

[Chorus]
Yeah, I get stupid, get stupid
I know it I know it
I get stupid, get stupid
I show it, I show it

[Bridge]
When you’re walking by my way
Every time I see you is a lovely day
And I can’t get you out my mind girl
The first time I layed’em on you all I wanna do is sing

[Pre-Verse]
Oh, damn! (Oh damn!)
Oh, damn! (Oh damn!)
Ooh, damn! (Oh damn!)
Ooooh, damn!

[Verse 2]
Girl, I wrote a song about you
Designed a little part that reminds me of your ass
Sexy from the back, a-ha
Give me some of that, a-ha
Girl I’d love to sing your song
Girl I’d really love to sing all night long
On and on and on, for sure
It goes a little something like this

[Pre-Chorus]
I can’t stop girl
Every time you walking down the block
Girl talking tender lovely
You’re so hot girl, ooooh
Girl, I go stupid for you

I get stupid, get stupid
I show it, I show it
Yeah, I get stupid, get stupid
I know it I know it
I get stupid, get stupid
I show it, I show it
Midnight, something don't feel right
It's been too much, too far away from home
Hard life, living the hard life
I can't resist, I'm falling
To the danger zone

All day long I'm pushed and shoved
I just can't get enough
In the danger zone

Red light, don't stop for no red light
You know I'm always trouble on my own
Lonely, ever so lonely
I've got too much time
I'm heading for the danger zone

All day long I'm pushed and shoved
I just can't get enough
In the danger zone

I'm eager, eager to please
I can't stand no more
It's got me on my knees
Ain't gonna feel no hurt
Ain't gonna feel no pain
I got nothin' left to lose
I ain't got no shame
Don't try to stop me
Just leave me on my own
I'm gonna live or die
In the danger zone

I'm living in the danger zone
In the danger zone
Hard life, I'm living the hard life
I'm gonna take a chance
In the danger zone
Lonely, ever so lonely
I'm gonna live or die
In the danger zone

Midnight, can't wait until midnight
Help me I'm falling to the danger zone
In these days of confusion
You've turned angry and cold
You say it's an illusion
There's no fire in your soul
Say you don't love me
Say you don't care
But don't leave me standing here
Your heart's like a wheel
Just waiting to roll
It's longing for freedom
To get out on the road
You're hungry for something
That you may never find
So many reasons
Your love has made you blind
You say you don't love me
You say you don't care
So don't leave me standing here
Don't leave me standing here
You say you don't love me
You say you don't care
Don't leave me
Don't leave me standing here
Life ain't been easy
Full of passion and pain
Told me no reason
Why I was to blame
Don't leave me standing
Don't leave me standing
Don't leave me standing
On my own
I still remember how it used to be
I thought the only thing
That mattered was me

You always told me it was just insane
To feel such joy
While others feel pain

And there's no way to change this angry heart
Cause when love goes
It will tear you apart

And it's been this way since time began
It's a desperate search for a promised land
And the years slip by like so much sand

So many people who are dying to live
It tortures my heart
They've got so much to give

I never saw it as a battle before
To win the fight
There has to be more
And there's no way to change this angry heart
Cause all these fears
Will tear you apart

And it's been this way since time began
It's an endless journey, it's the fate of man
To live each day and never understand

And it's been this way since time began
It's a desperate search for a master plan
And the years slip by like water through your hands
No one told me the way I should feel
You left an aching heart
Lost and lonely, the feeling goes on

You were the one friend I had
You gave me so much love
Now the tears remind me you're gone

It still haunts me there's a silence
Where you used to be
It still haunts me
Just an empty space in history
It still haunts me
But life must go on, on and on

It's still haunting me

It's still haunting me
Haunting me, haunting me
It's still haunting me
There's a man who sees all there is to see
What the future holds for all
As the days grow dark, was his sole and final warning
Beware of the one with invisible friends
They will steal into your mind
And all too soon, the signs begin to show

Rise up to the shining
Live long live now
Rise up to the shining
Don't be blind by fools again
Fools again

As the page is turned and the story's told
From the visions he had seen
The house on the hill with the haunting eyes that call
No one left when madness came out
To play its game
If you stay too long, you'll finally go insane

Rise up to the shining
Live long live now
Rise up to the shining
Don't be blind by fools again
Fools again
Bells will take their toll
On your way
There's no way we're born to shine
Before our time, all your life, you're
On your own
Lonely road
Lost in a time
Let the light lead your way
To the golden throne
It's the only way

Rise up to the shining
Live long live now
Rise up to the shining
Don't be blind by fools again
Rise up to the shining
Live long live now
Rise up to the shining
Don't be blind by fools again

Oh rise up, to the shining
Wise up, they're gonna steal your mind
Rise up, the house is gonna haunt you
No one laughed, no one cried
You stayed too long
You're finally gonna stay

[Verse 1]
There's no end, there's no beginning to the old man's story
Does he still remember me from lives gone by?
I see his spirit rising upon the black of time
I've got nowhere to hide
Will he keep a place for me?

[Chorus]
He is the king of all kings
The keeper of light
He holds eternity's wings

[Verse 2]
In his eyes, an ocean's burning
Swollen seas of tears
Troubled mind, the beating war drums in his ears
No-one ever hears his warning
Am I the one he calls?
When they tell me they're afraid, some say I'll be put away

[Chorus]
He is the king of all kings
The keeper of light
He holds eternity's wings
My blood will spill my blood

My blood will spill my blood

[Verse 3]
In the wisdom of the prophet's never-ending tale
Open up the eyes within your mind, he said
Crowned in his ancient glory
There's a king within us all
Some will say it's all in vain, that he doesn't have a name

[Chorus]
He is the king of all kings
The keeper of light
He holds eternity's wings
Livin' in the fast lane is easy
Till you run out of road
Friends will turn to strangers
When you're out of control
A slip of the tongue when
It's done, is often hard to see it thru
So never let your words be lies
Or they'll come looking for you

It's a hard life to love

For the price of glory you left
And threw your fortunes away
Never really cared too much for
The job or the pay
You're standing in the rain with
No cover but you never complain
You're an angry young man face to face
But your mirror's insane

It's a hard life to love
I'm simply refusing a part in your world
Cause I see, I see how it burns
See how it turns
And you're simply denying the fact
That you're blind and I see no more
I see red - I only see red

Think of all the times I was
Hurting but you felt no pain
Think of all the lies you told me
Again and again
And still you see the truth
From those who continue to lie
And now you're seeking life
From those who are living to die

It's a hard life to love

I'm simply refusing a part in your world
Cause I see, I see how it burns
I see how it turns
And you're simply denying the fact
That you're blind and I see no more
I see red - I only see red

Livin' in the fast lane ain't easy
When you run out of road
Friends will turn to strangers
When you've nowhere to go
Don't give a damn when you're lost
Cause you'll die from it all
Laws were made to be broken
And you do it for the thrill of it all
It's a hard life to love
It's a hard life to love
It's a hard life to love
I've run out of road
Hard life to love
I've run out of road
It's a hard life to love
Winged with steel they fill the air
The soldiers of fortune will ride
Into the sights of the enemy's gun
Those who have taken their oaths
Tonight
Are well prepared they know
They'll do or die even if it's suicide

Let's take a chance
As the skies will Burn tonite
Wasted lives and spirits run free
On the wings of no return

Dressed to kill where eagles dare
The fate of a nation's at hand
Is this the answer to their prayer
Come the dawn, thru their blood
Red skies return with tears in their eyes
And they recall thou shalt not kill

And in the morning
They'll take a hero's bow
And make the ever lasting flight
Hear them calling up above all
Across the skies
Hear them calling up above from
The other side

Here them call!

Let's take a chance
As the skies will burn tonite
Wasted lives and spirits run free
On the wings of no return

Let's take a chance
As the skies will burn tonite
Wasted lives and spirits run free
On the wings of no return
I'll play your game
But if you lose you're gonna have to pay the price
Broken chains, like a prisoner free at last
The fear inside just up and died
Time will tell if I am wrong
It won't be too long

You thing I'm chasing shadows
In the dark
Well I'm not born to lose
I'm not born to lose

You curse my name, as I turn and walk away, from view
It won't be too long
You don't scare me cos you're
Hard to see and it's time
That you were gone
It won't be too long

You think I'm chasing shadows
In the dark
Well I'm not born to lose
You think I'm chasing shadows
In the dark
What you gonna do about it now
What you gonna do about it now

It won't be too long
It won't be too long

You think I'm chasing shadows
In the dark
What you gonna do about it now
What you gonna do about it now

Ain't nothing you can do about it now
I close my eyes, started dreaming
See a vision filled with wings heading my way
Feel the presence of unknown power
Telling me to come
This is the only way

It's a dream within a dream
Lost and lonely
Don't be fooled by the devil's hand

Silent screamer filled with fear
As the night time shapes a face
Then disappears
Scared forever into believing
That your mind has met the prince of whom you see

It's a dream within a dream
Lost and lonely
Don't be fooled by the devil's hand

It's a dream within a dream
Lost forever
Don't be fooled by the devil
In your eyes
The evil spirit rises
Blinded by the dark
You fall into shame
As the reaper takes you
Down the spiral stairway
You share the evil pit
With satan's name

Nightmare it's got me runnin'
Nightmare it's calling you
Nightmare it's got me runnin'
Nightmare it's calling you

It's a dream within a dream
Lost and lonely
Don't get fooled, by the devil

It's a dream within a dream
Lost forever
Don't be fooled by the devil

It's got me running
It's just a nightmare
It's got me running
It's got me running
All your life you're been slipping and sliding
Trying to find a way
Sun won't shine but now it's your time to pay
There's no turning back as you look
The hangman in the eye
Now hell's just your death away

It's too late to say you care
When there's evil in your stare
You say you're not to blame

In your head voices mocking
Every prayer

Remember the face you saw
That once was you
Spirit high there's no way that
You could lose
Give him rope they said
As you look the hangman in the eye
Now around your neck you feel the noose
It's too late to say you care
When there's evil in your stare
You say you're not to blame

In your head voices mocking
Every prayer
Now you're lost forever

I'm burning with fire
It's time to leave or get out
I'm burning in fire
I can't take no more so get out
I'm burning with fire
The wheels of steel will grind you
Burning in fire
This time you're lost forever

Lost forever!
There's an evil in your stare
Lost forever!
And hell's just a breath away
Lost forever!
And there's no way out you burn
With fire it's time to get out
Get out, get out
Lost forever!
There's evil in your stare
No-one said it had to be this way
Why are we the victims of their final word?
Dying world is killing us so slowly
I believe no God may save us now
Can you see what I see?

Sinners, say your prayers tonight
The judgement day is here

Child of tomorrow will die
Not even born
Jesus, our questions he never seems to hear
Dying for the answers may be price we pay
To find a key to our lives

Is there a Heaven?
Is there a Hell?
Who's this God?
Tell me there's no God above
Why?
We choose what Lord deep within our souls
He's not one thing
We are His spirit
We could save this world from destruction day

Can you see what I see?
Can you hear me cry?
Oh God, can You help me now?
Take my hand

You and I are victims of their world
As the masters of power try to poison our world
Greed, money taking over their souls
Just mechanical brains
Politicians don't know
They just don't know

[Verse 1]
River's strong, you can't swim inside it
We could string some lights up the hill beside it
Tonight the moon's so bright you could drive with your headlights out
Because a little bit of summer's what the whole year's all about

[Chorus]
You look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say
Hasn't it been some kind of day?
You and me been catching on like a wildfire

[Verse 2]
Don't get up, just to
Get another, you can
Drink from mine, we can't
Leave each other
We can dance with the dead
You can rest your head on my shoulder
If you want to get older with me
Because a little bit of summer makes a lot of history

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I got a rock from the river
In my medicine bag
Magpie feather
In his medicine bag

[Chorus]
Look through the people, and on through the mist
To the hill of the headless cross
Where all witches meet, on a night such as this
And the power of darkness is host
They come face to face, eye to eye, soul to soul
With an Angel that fell from the sky
Borne on the air, are the screams and the wails
Of the masses appointed to die

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture
At the headless cross, at the headless cross

From the first evil night, when a black flash of light
Cut the crucifix half to the ground
There's been no escape from the power of Satan
On a nation so brave and so proud

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture
At the headless cross, at the headless cross
How do you feel, when the locks refuse the key
And the master is calling your name
Does the luck of the charm, really keep you from harm
Does the talisman protect you from pain

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture
At the headless cross, at the headless cross

From the first evil night, when a black flash of light
Cut the crucifix half to the ground
There's no escaping from the power of Satan
For a people so brave and so proud

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture
At the headless cross, at the headless cross
At the headless cross, at the headless cross

Where will you run to, at the headless cross
Look, to the headless cross
Silence is mocking, the dawn of a new day
Devil and Daughter, are both on their way
The Evil of her nature, collects in her eyes
With him there's no fear, of the dawn bringing light

Baptised with fire, too wild to be tamed
She's hot, evil and ready, to take any man
Let no one put asunder, the power or the pain
He is the master of hell, riding again

Devil and Daughter - pleasure and pain
Devil and Daughter - is this the end

A thousand times over, you'll hear on the wind
In the name of hell, these sinners never sinned
But Satan never listens, to the words that they send
Drenching the soil with blood, when will it end

Devil and Daughter
He's got the power she's got the pain
Devil and Daughter
She'll break any woman and take any man
Devil and Daughter
Hand in hand with the Reaper
He saw the world, dim with the glow of the vertical sun
His skin crept cold knowing that this was the hours of dying
Misguided mortals you'll burn with me
Spirit of man, cannot be freed

When death calls - this is the hours of dying
When death calls - the spirit of man can be freed
When death calls - there's no tomorrow
When death calls - just an evil shadow

Tell me not fear of the flames means that heaven is closer
For I believe, Satan lives, in the souls of dying
Misguided mortals you'll burn with me
Spirit of man, cannot be freed

When death calls - heaven is closer
When death calls - feel the heat of the flames from the souls of the dying
When death calls - here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
When death calls - you're gonna burn

Don't look in those sunken eyes
Don't look and you'll stay alive
Don't laugh in the face of death or your tongue will blister
Can't die until Satan says, you die
And Satan takes your soul
In the face of death or your tongue will blister
Don't look in those sunken eyes
Don't look and you'll stay alive
Don't laugh in the face of death or your tongue will blister
Can't die until Satan says, you die
The Devil takes your soul
With all his wrath he calls the reaper

When death calls - this is the hours of dying
When death calls - the spirit of man can be freed
When death calls - there's no tomorrow
When death calls - just an evil shadow

When death calls - feel the heat of the flames from the souls of the dying
When death calls - you're gonna burn, burn, burn
When death calls - heaven is closer
When death calls - I can feel it, gonna take you down
There's something wrong there's a chill in the air
And the blood in my vein's running colder
The eastern sky is beginning to silver
And the words that you speak start to falter
The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed
In the house of the dead there's a taker
Some say that this is the ultimate sin
When the spirit world turns to the alter

There's been a kill in the spirit world
There's been a kill in the spirit world

Behold, the dead clutching at fading hands, out of reach forever
"In glory die" calls the voice of the void
Your assassin has cursed every spectre
The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed
And the house of the dead seeks a master
Stretching every muscle, wait for the end
And a kiss on the wind, whispers murder, murder

There's been a kill in the spirit world
There's been a kill in the spirit world
There's been a kill in the spirit world
When heaven is closer, it's pleasure and pain
Kill in the spirit world

Did you see another in black
Is the blood in your veins running colder
If you did then there's no turning back
As the spirit world turns to the alter
The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed
And the house of the dead seeks a master
Stretching every muscle, wait for the end
And a kiss on the wind, whispers murder

There's been a kill in the spirit world
There's been a kill in the spirit world

Oh here it comes, oh no

The seal is broken, the eastern sky is beginning to silver
There's something wrong, there's a chill in the air
I feel the Evil, I feel the Evil
Somebody whispers murder
A kiss on the wind whispers murder
In this last and final hour, you can't hide
There's nowhere now that you can run
All eyes are on you, like a lost eternal light
Princes and kings, and demons with wings
Summon your fears from hell

It's the call of the wild
Calling you

In this last macabre hour, witches cry
And turn to dust before the moon
Many spirits are lost forever, but one survives
To call the tune of Lucifer

It's the call of the wild
Calling you

Hero, only in the grave are there no dreams
Hero, don't believe in fate it ain't what it seems
All you gotta do now is stay free
You're the one they turn to when hell screams
Fear of the devil, has no place among the brave
Faced with pain, there's a battle to be won
All eyes are on you, like a host eternal light
Princes and kings, and demons with wings
Summon your fears from hell

It's the call of the wild
Calling you

Hero, only in the grave are there no dreams
Hero, don't believe in fate it ain't what it seems
Hero, only in the grave are there no dreams
Hero, don't believe in fate it ain't what it seems

Hero, you got the fear of the devil, burning your soul
Hero, it's the call of the wild
Hero, tearing your soul
Oh the devil is rising with the moon he cries and my blood runs cold
Oh no never was the darkness so black, no light and nowhere to go
My spirit is crying for a love so tired of being alone
I remember he came here to steal, and you are his stealer of souls

I see a black moon rising, and it's calling out my name
Oh it's calling my name

I've been blinded, lost and confused, darkness will call me no more
Heaven is no friend of mine, no god ever knocked on my door

I see a black moon rising, and it's calling out my name
It's calling out my name, it's calling

I see a black moon rising, and it's calling out my name
Oh it's calling my name

I'm standing on the dark side of time reaching for the power of her hand
She's weaving an unholy light and calls from Lucifer's land

I see a black moon rising, and it's calling out my name
An angel of hell is rising, heaven's no friend of mine
I see a black moon rising, and it's calling out my name
I see a black moon rising, and it causes so much pain
An angel of hell is rising, heaven's no friend of mine
I see a black moon rising, and it's calling out my name

It's calling my name, this spirit's crying for love
Heaven's no friend of mine
Nightwing has stirred, and taken to flight
The silence is over, he's shattered the night
No other hunter has the power or the grace
He is the master of this place

Tell every creature of the night
The kill is around the bend
So listen my friend
Nightwing flies again

They say he comes, for those whose souls are weak
And calls his name upon the wind
The night is cold and thick with mystery
Oh I can feel his beating wings

Tell every creature of the night
The kill is around the bend
Nightwing flies again

Tell every creature of the night
The kill is around the bend
Nightwing flies again
Nightwing has stirred, and taken to flight
The silence is over, he's shattered the night
Life ain't for giving and forgivin' ain't free
No soul will rest while the hunted run free

So tell every creature of the night
The kill is around the bend
Listen my friend
Nightwing flies again
I remember the burning I felt inside
As you touched my frozen heart
I remember the screams and the pain within
As my soul was torn apart
I recall being hungry
And for years I stood my ground
Even though you were never, oh no never, never around
God, how I needed you

I remember they warned me, and oh how they told me
Yours was the kiss of shame
I remember the Devil coming to steal my soul again and again
I remember the dawn was breaking
In Cathedrals of unholy light
I was searching for answers where singers and dancers
Will travel on through the night
I've been hurt by Evil games
First you're here and then you ain't

Cloak and dagger, yeah, yeah yeah
Cloak and dagger
Cloak and dagger, yeah, yeah yeah
Cloak and dagger
Oh there's something about you that doesn't seam real
You say if I don't sell my soul you will steal
A promise should stand I know the command
And me like a fool took it in
In the valley of Death do I stand in the shadow
Or fight for the right to be free?
A kiss on the wind whispers die, die for glory

No, no

Cloak and dagger - You've been playing those Evil games
Cloak and dagger - Set me free I don't need this pain
Cloak and dagger - Something about you just doesn't seem real
Cloak and dagger - Your say if I don't sell my soul you will steal
Cloak and dagger - Your kiss of shame has been hunting me
Cloak and dagger - God, how I needed you

[Verse 1]
My motivation has gone too soon
Good vibrations all over you
Act like you mean it, you mean it
You've got a story you never tell
Down in the delta I'm ringing bells
I've never seen it, seen it
Back of my mind I'm on my way
I see through smiles on every face
I don't believe it, believe it

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a supersoaker red, white
And blew 'em all away
With the kisses unclean as the words that you say

[Chorus]
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away

[Verse 2]
The flags are flying across the plains
I've got a secret picking at my brain
I wanna see you, see you
The exit sign is on my face
Don't know my home, I don't know my place
I just wanna be there, be there

[Bridge]
'Cause I'm a supersoaker red, white
And blew 'em all away
With the kisses unclean as the words that you say

[Chorus]
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away

[Chorus]
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away

[Chorus 2]
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
I just lay it on the line, on the line

[Chorus]
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away

[Chorus]
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, ooh

[Produced by DJ Camper]

[Chorus]
Tell 'em that I need more
Fire, fire, fire, fire (yeah)
Fire, fire, fire, fire
Tell 'em that we need more
Fire, fire, fire, fire
Tell 'em that I need more
Fire, fire, fire, fire
Fire, fire, fire, fire

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I woke up this morning, rolled a joint, then got to it
Dealt with real life shit, manned up and got through it
I'm a real D-Boy, take a look up in my face
Never did real estate, and still put you in your place
I don't trust dog hoes, dog hoes got fleas
From where they rock ski-masks and don't nobody ski
Every time I spit a verse, my city like "Preach!"
Niggas thought I got evicted how my shit up in the streets
B-I-G Sean, ain't nothing obese, but the feast
Swear I'm skinny cause I'm always on my feet
Gotta hustle every second, stacking paper every week
Boy I'm in the field for real, I might run up in some cleats
Was in Japan so long, I almost learn to speak, had to leave
Back to the hood, where they don't understand unless you speak in Trapanese
If I fall down, bet I only trampoline, bounce back
Back on my feet, that's just how I be
I be out of town repping valid as an absentee
Lord, jeeze, jealous motherfuckers trying to absent me
Fuck these niggas up, now it's absent teeth
Trying to pass on me, when I'm first place in the Playoffs bitch
I'm even working half days on my day off bitch
Say it's gon kill me fuck it, I work graveyard shifts
'Long as that weed and money chilling in the pile
Bitch, I need that fucking fire

[Chorus]
Tell 'em that I need more
Fire, fire, fire, fire (yeah)
Fire, fire, fire, fire
Tell 'em that we need more
Fire, fire, fire, fire
Tell 'em that I need more
Fire, fire, fire, fire
Fire, fire, fire, fire

[Bridge]
Right now, right now, right now
I know it's been a long, long
It's been a long, long time
A long time, I know it's been a long, long time

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I woke up this morning, rolled a joint, then got to it
Can do anything in the world except not do it
Bought my fam new land, six star crib
Momma feeling like she Jewish, I'm the motherfucking truest
Yeah I talk about my mom, but shoutout to my dad
Would drive me to school every single chance he had
Tell me 'bout the crazy girls and all about his past
And gave me the talks that made me to a man
Not everybody got a dad but they got a Uncle Sam
And he ain't came around till I made a 100 grand
Coming from Detroit where everybody say "what up doe?"
Horror movie shit, cause everybody there cut throat
Watch who you hustle with you might not get a cut though
Even though you deserved a commission plus mo
And grandma sad when she saw my commercial
"Stop having people at your shows that wasn't at rehearsals"
I’m tryna to get a office at the Empire State
To bring it back to empire's plate, that's home
Man, I'm reppin' for my entire state
Prayin' that I won't be late
When it's all finished at the endin', after all bottles spillin'
Throttle gripping, models switching, chin chilling in my villa
Fucking like I tryna populate a village, I'm replenished
I didn't do it just for the money, man, for the feeling
I made it through the...

[Chorus]
Tell 'em that I need more
Fire, fire, fire, fire (yeah)
Fire, fire, fire, fire
Tell 'em that we need more
Fire, fire, fire, fire
Tell 'em that I need more
Fire, fire, fire, fire
Fire, fire, fire, fire

[Bridge]
Right now, right now, right now
I know it's been a long, long
It's been a long, long time
A long time, I know it's been a long, long time

[Outro: Big Sean, James Fauntleroy, & Nicole Lequerica]
But it's never, never been too late
It's never, never been too late
It's never, never been too late
It's never ever been too late
Right now, right now
I know it's been a long
I know it's been a long, long time
Just know that it's never, never been to late
It's never, never been too late
It's never ever been too late
It's never ever been too late
Do what you wanna do
Fuck everything else

[Verse 1]
If I told you that this couldn't get better, baby
And your heartbeat, it lets me know you feel the same
I can hold you, keep you safe until you fall asleep
Never worried, 'cause I can give you what you need

[Pre-Chorus]
Now everything I do is all for loving you
It's not something that we're used to
No other way to say, I need you every day
And now I'm gonna change my ways
And it's a part of you I never wanna lose
I'll do anything you want me to
Like any other day, I know I'll find a way
And if ever I'm alone, you'll say

[Chorus]
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you

[Verse 2]
In a moment, I know that everything could change
And I know that my life would never be the same
But you're the only one that's making sense to me
When I close my eyes, you're the one I see
There's no other way I could ever be without you, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
Now everything I do is all for loving you
It's not something that we're used to
No other way to say, I need you every day
And now I'm gonna change my ways
And it's a part of you I never wanna lose
I'll do anything you want me to
Like any other day, I know I'll find a way
And if ever I'm alone, you'll say

[Chorus]
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you

[Verse 1: Calvin Harris]
I'm coming 'round and now my vision is so clear
If I could change my state of mind, then I would disappear
The love I get from you is something I can't chance
And I could let you slip away without a second glance

[Pre-Chorus: Calvin Harris]
Why can't I realise I'm fighting for my life?
Woaaah, woaaah
Why can't I realise I'm fighting for my life?
Woaaah, woaaah

[Chorus: Ayah]
This is like a flashback, this is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit inside a memory
This is like a flashback, this is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit inside a memory
This is like a flashback, flashback
This is like a flashback, flashback

[Pre-Chorus: Calvin Harris]
Why can't I realise I'm fighting for my life?
Woaaah, woaaah
Why can't I realise I'm fighting for my life?
Woaaah, woaaah

[Chorus: Ayah]
This is like a flashback, this is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit inside a memory
This is like a flashback, this is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit inside a memory

[Verse 1]
I just remembered, that time at the market
Snuck up behind me and jumped on my shopping cart
And rode down, aisle 5
You looked behind you to smile back at me
Crashed into a rack full of magazines
They asked us if we could leave

Can't remember, what went wrong last September
Though I'm sure that you'd remind me, if you had to

[Chorus 1]
Our love was, comfortable and
So broken in

[Verse 2]
I sleep with this new girl I'm still getting used to
My friends all approve, say she's going to be good for you
They throw me, high fives

She says the bible is all that she reads
And prefers that I not use profanity
Your mouth was so dirty
Life of the party
And she swears that she's artsy
But you could distinguish
Miles from Coltrane

[Chorus 1]
Our love was, comfortable and
So broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
Or so they say
Say

[Verse 3]
She thinks I can't see the smile that she's faking
And poses for pictures that aren't being taken
I loved you
Grey sweat pants, no makeup, so perfect

[Chorus 2]
Our love was, comfortable and
So broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
I'm not impressed
I want you back

[Kanye West]
I'd rather just let the music speak for itself. You know, it's like, I was happy to be in a situation where people couldn't say, oh, I was trying to promote my own song. For the times that I've, like, defended myself...

I'm pushing the envelope! I wrote my fuckin' 'Run This Town' verse for a fuckin' month! When I heard Eminem's verse on the Drake shit, I went back and rewrote my shit for two days. I canceled appointments to rewrite! I fuckin' care! You know what I'm saying? And that's what I'm saying. Because I did that, Taylor Swift cannot win over Beyoncé! Because I wrote my verse in two days, Taylor Swift cannot beat Beyoncé. As long as I'm alive! And if I'm alive, kill me then! Kill me then! As long as I'm alive, you gon' have to deal with it. Cause there ain't gonna be no more motherfucking Elvises with no James Browns

[Female voice]
Why are you so angry? What's the anger?

[Kanye West]
Because my mother got arrested for the fuckin' sit-ins. My mother died for this fame shit! I moved to fuckin' Hollywood chasing this shit. My mother died because of this shit. Fuck MTV

It ain't no love. What the fuck was Pink performing? Don't nobody know that song. Pink performed twice! Two songs? How the fuck Pink perform twice and I didn't even get asked to perform "Heartless." "Heartless" is the biggest song of the year! It had the most spins of the first quarter! I don't know that Pink song! But I noticed that she's pink! They put me in a fuckin' room and projected it

[Male voice]
How the fuck did Eminem get the Best Hip-Hop song in 2008?

[Kanye West]
Eminem won Best Video! Rap Video! Yo, when he won that shit, I was so happy. I was so happy I ran all this shit. I said, "Nigga, I'm gon' do this until y'all put a bullet in my head. I'm runnin' up to y'all, put a..." 

[tape cuts]

[Verse 1]
Midnight
Lock all the doors
And turn out the lights
Feels like the end of the world
This Sunday night

There's not a sound
Outside the snow's coming down

[Chorus]
And somehow I can't seem to find
The quiet inside my mind

[Verse 2]
Three o' two
The space in this room
Has turned on me
And all my fears have cornered me here
Me and my TV screen
The volume's down
Blue lights are dancing around

[Chorus]
And somehow I can't seem to find
The quiet inside my mind

[Outro]
Daylight is climbing the walls
Cars start and feet walk the halls
The world awakes and now I am safe
At least by the light of day
At least by the light of day

[Chorus]
Back to you
It always comes around
Back to you
I tried to forget you
I tried to stay away
But it's too late

[Chorus 2]
Over you
I'm never over
Over you
Something about you
It's just the way you move
The way you move me

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I'm so good at forgetting
And I quit every game I play
But forgive me, love
I can't turn and walk away
This way

[Chorus]
Back to you
It always comes around
Back to you
I walk with your shadow
I'm sleeping in my bed
With your silhouette

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Should have smiled in that picture
If it's the last that I'll see of you
It's the least that you
Could not do

[Bridge]
Leave the light on
I'll never give up on you
Leave the light on
For me too
For me too
For me too
Yeah

[Chorus 3]
Back to me
I know that it comes
Back to me
Doesn't it scare you
Your will is not as strong
As it used to be

[Verse 1]
My stupid mouth
Has got me in trouble
I said too much again
To a date over dinner yesterday
And I could see
She was offended
She said, "Well anyway..."
Just dying for a subject change

[Bridge]
Oh, another social casualty
Score one more for me
How could I forget?
Mama said, think before speaking
No filter in my head
Oh, what's a boy to do?
I guess he better find one soon

[Verse 2]
We bit our lips, she looked out the window
Rolling tiny balls of napkin paper
I played a quick game of chess
With the salt and pepper shaker
And I could see clearly
An indelible line was drawn
Between what was good
What just slipped out and what went wrong

[Bridge]
Oh, the way she feels about me has changed
Thanks for playing, try again
How could I forget?
Mama said, think before speaking
No filter in my head
Oh, what's a boy to do?
I guess he better find one

[Chorus]
I'm never speaking up again
It only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery
Than she desert me
Oh, I'm never speaking up again
Starting now

[Verse 3]
One more thing: Why is it my fault?
So maybe, I try too hard
But it's all because of this desire
I just want to be liked
Just want to be funny
Looks like the joke's on me
So call me Captain Backfire

[Chorus]
I'm never speaking up again
It only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery
Than she desert me
Oh, I'm never speaking up again
I'm never speaking up again
I'm never speaking up again
Starting now
Starting now

[Verse 1]
Don't know why Tori came by
But I could see by the look in her eyes
Tori had been driving around the town for a while
Playing with the thought of leaving

Don't know why, but Tori just smiled
And mentioned something about how you were right
Must have been hard to see through the tears she was hiding

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, I might not be seeing him soon
I've got a few things I've been waiting to do

[Chorus]
Hey, Tori came by
Tori came by tonight
Hey, Tori came by
She says to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Looked outside at the car in the drive
And the suitcase on the back seat inside
Sure it's so she can't look out behind at the road

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, I might not be seeing him soon
I've got a few things I've been waiting to do

[Chorus]
Hey, Tori came by
Tori came by tonight
Hey, Tori came by
She says to say goodbye

[Outro]
Don't look down, she seemed alright
You might be asking where is Tori tonight
Somewhere out on the highway, I'm sure she's fine

[Verse 1]
I know you've been sworn
I read your complaint
You're needing someone older
And though I've been warned to live day by day
There's something taking over

Did you expect to kiss me one time
While looking at me with the same eyes ever again
So come on and face it
So come on and face it
It's time that we say it

[Chorus]
You can cross the line whenever you want to
I'm calling it love soon
Close your mind and waste some time if you have to
I'm calling it love soon
It's not about you now
It's what we are

[Verse 2]
Your mother complains that you need a man
You haven't mentioned me yet
And all of your friends don't know who I am
I've been your best kept secret

I understand I wasn't part of the plan
A dollar short, a minute early
But I am your man
So come on and face it
So come on and face it
It's time that we say it

[Chorus]
You can cross the line whenever you want to
I'm calling it love soon
Close your mind and waste some time if you have to
I'm calling it love soon
It's not about you now
It's what we are
It's what we are

[Bridge]
Let's bypass the bullshit and move on because
The minute hand moves faster than you think it does
And by no fault of yours and by no fault of mine
The bottom line is laying in the bed that we've been playing in tonight
That we've been playing in tonight

[Chorus]
I'm calling it love soon
I'm calling it love soon
You can cross the line whenever you want to
I'm calling it love soon
Close your mind and waste some time if you have to
I'm calling it love soon
It's not about you now
It's what we are

[Verse]
They call me the breeze
I keep blowing down the road
They call me the breeze
I keep blowing down the road
I've got nobody
I'm carrying no load

There's no change in the weather
There's no change in me
There's no change in the weather
There's no change in me
I'm not hiding from nobody
Nobody’s hiding from me

I got that green light babe
I've got to keep moving on
I got that green light, babe
I've got to keep moving on
I might go up to California
Might go down to Georgia
I don’t know

[Verse 1]
Well, the times are slowly changing
Baby, even when it's live
You can press pause and rewind
You knew it'd go amazing
But is this what you had in mind?
Oh, there's nothing you can't find

[Chorus]
It's two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy
It's two thousand and thirteen
(Yeah)

[Verse 2]
On the back of a transmitter
There's a little shiny fruit
And it's coming after you
As for Instagram and Twitter
She got caught in both lassoes
And neither one will cut her loose

[Chorus]
It's two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy
It's two thousand and thir–
–Teen
(Yeah)
Yeah

[Bridge]
So, baby, take a walk with me
Past flying cars and time machines
There's magic like you won't believe, no

[Chorus]
It's two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy
It's two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy

[Verse 1: Richard Hawley]
I like the way you look at me, baby
Please don't try to turn out the lights
I act as if I'm not going crazy
But girl, I'm in a muddle tonight
Would you tell me where you're gonna take it?
If I had a heart, you're the one who should break it
The engine's running
Can't decide if I should ride away

[Chorus: Richard Hawley & Alex Turner]
You and I
You and I

[Bridge: Richard Hawley]
I had a woman, she went away
And now I'm lonely
Fuck it

[Chorus: Richard Hawley & Alex Turner]
You and I
You and I
You and I
You and I

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Richard Hawley]
Would you tell me where you're gonna take it?
If I had a heart, you're the one who should break it
The engine's running
Can't decide if I should ride away

[Chorus: Richard Hawley & Alex Turner]
You and I
You and I
You and I
You and I
You and I
You and I

[Verse 3: Richard Hawley]
I like the way you look at me, baby
Please don't try to turn out the lights
I act as if I'm not going crazy
But girl, I'm in a muddle tonight

[Tape break] I'm pushing the envelope! I wrote my fuckin' 'Run This Town' verse for a fuckin' month! When I heard Eminem's verse on the Drake shit, I went back and rewrote my shit for two days. I canceled appointments to rewrite! I fuckin' care! You know what I'm saying? And that's what I'm saying. Because I did that, Taylor Swift cannot win over Beyoncé! Because I wrote my verse in two days, Taylor Swift cannot beat Beyoncé. As long as I'm alive! And if I'm alive, kill me then! Kill me then! As long as I'm alive, you gon' have to deal with it.

[A female voice asks, "Why are you so angry? What's the anger?"] Because my mother got arrested for the fuckin' sit-ins. My mother died for this fame shit! I moved to fuckin' Hollywood chasing this shit. My mother died because of this shit. Fuck MTV.

[tape cuts].

[Verse 1]
One day, my hoops will be made of diamonds
My knuckles made of real gold
I'll spend my days getting high with all my friends
In the glamorous and green old part of Hollywood

[Pre-Chorus]
Sun will rise, I'm a supernova
Body electric and I dance like Morrison
When the night begins, baby comes alive again

[Chorus]
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
I'm alive again
I'm alive again

[Verse 2]
One day, I'll drive in a gold Mercedes Benz
Singing opera on Bel Air Road
Hair to my ass will be flying in the wind
Shootin' heroin and speedballs

[Pre-Chorus]
See the sea, I'm a supernova
I walk on water and I dance like Joplin
When the sun descends, I dive into the waves again

[Chorus]
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
I'm alive again
I'm alive again

[Bridge]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, c-can you see me?
Whoa-oh, my heart beating fast
I can feel it chasing in the speed-lights
I was built to last
Whoa-oh, c-can you feel that?
Ah-ah, ah-ah, my heart shakin' fast
I can feel that you're the one for me
You'll be my first, and you'll be my last

[Chorus]
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
I'm alive again
I'm alive again

[Outro]
I'm alive again
I'm alive again

[Chorus]
Oh, boy, you’re starry eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You’ve got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that

[Verse 1]
Life doesn’t always work out like you planned it
They say, "Make lemonade out of lemons,"
But I try and I just can’t understand it
All this trying for no good reason
Man makes plans and God laughs
Why do I even bother to ask, Honey?
Well, once you and I, we were the king and queen of this town
It doesn’t matter now
The sun's setting on our love, bye, baby

[Chorus]
Oh, boy, you’re starry eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You’ve got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that

[Verse 2]
Life doesn’t always work out like you planned it
They say, "Make lemonade out of lemons,"
But I try and I can’t understand it
All this begging for no good reason
Man makes plans and God laughs
Why do I even bother to ask, Honey?
Well, once you and I, we were the king and queen of this town
It doesn’t matter now
The sun's setting on our love, bye bye, baby

[Chorus]
Oh, boy, you’re starry eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You’ve got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that

[Bridge]
It doesn’t matter what they say
Let’s go do it anyway
Cause you and I have an undying kind of love
You can be mine, I’ll be yours, c'mon baby

[Chorus]
Oh, boy, you’re starry eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You’ve got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that
Oh, boy, you’re starry eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You’ve got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that

[Intro: Chester Bennington]
…Room to breathe
'Bout to…
Break
Breathe
I'm about to break
Breathe
I need room to breathe
Breathe
I need room to breathe
Breathe
I need room to breathe

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out anyway

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

[Interlude: Chester Bennington]
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Just like before
Like before
Like before
Like before
Like before

[Chorus: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me…
And I'm about to break (Like before)
I need a little room to breathe…
And I'm about to break (Like before)
Everything you say to me…
And I'm about to break (Like before)
I need a little room to breathe…
And I'm about to break (Like before)

[Verse 3: Jonathan Davis, Chester Bennington]
These are the places where I can feel
Torn from my body, my flesh, it peels
During this ride, we can cut up what we like (I'm about to break)
Waiting alone, I cannot resist
Feeling this hate I have never missed
Please, someone give me a reason to rip off my face
Blood is a-pouring, and pouring, and pouring
And pouring, and pouring, and pouring, and pouring
And pouring, and pouring, and pouring, and pouring (Shut up when I'm talkin' to you)

[Bridge: Chester Bennington, Jonathan Davis]
Shut up (Blood is pouring)
Shut up (Blood is pouring)
Shut up (Blood is pouring)
Shut up when I'm talkin' to you
Shut up (Blood is pouring)
Shut up (Blood is pouring)
Shut up (Blood is pouring)
Shut up
I'm about to break

[Chorus: Chester Bennington with Jonathan Davis, with Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me… I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe… I'm about to break
Everything you say to me… and I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe… and I'm about to…
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break)
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge)
And I'm about to…

[Verse 1]
I paint my nails black
I dye my hair a darker shade of brown
'Cause you like your women Spanish
Dark, strong and proud
I paint the sky black
You said if you could have your way
You'd make it nighttime all today
So it'd suit the mood of your soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, what can I do?
Nothing, my sparrow blue

[Chorus]
Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful, but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you

[Post-Chorus]
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah

[Verse 2]
I paint the house black
My wedding dress black leather too
You have no room for light
Love is lost on you
I keep my lips red
To seem like cherries in the spring
Darling, you can't let everything
Seem so dark blue

[Pre-Chorus]
But oh, what can I do?
To turn you on or get through you?

[Chorus]
Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful, but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you

[Post-Chorus]
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah

[Bridge]
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, baby
Black beauty, baby

[Chorus]
Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful, but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you

[Post-Chorus]
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah

[Verse 1]
You smell like a million roses
Bathed in rock 'n' roll
Ours was the greatest
Love story ever told
Throat like an angel with a voice that was made of gold
That's my baby

[Verse 2]
He was the king of the town
With a crown that would never fall
A heart that would beat
Like a bass for his baby doll
One in a million, inimitable soul
That's my baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Young or old, summer or cold
Young or old, summer or cold

[Chorus]
You've got a way
Like JFK when you do it
The way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you've got a soul like no one I know
You're so new at it
The way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart, and it drives me crazy

[Verse 3]
He was the king of the town
With a crown that would never fall
A heart like a bass that would beat for his baby doll
Mind like a diamond
An un-imitable song
That's my baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Young or old, summer or cold
Young or old, summer or cold

[Chorus]
You've got a way
Like JFK when you do it
The way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you've got a soul like no one I know
You're so new at it
The way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart, and it drives me crazy
It drives me crazy

[Bridge]
You've got it
And I want it
Late summer nights in July, flaunt it
You know that you can always come home
To the one who gave you your name
'Cause I see a light in your eyes
It's so bright, and
The skies, they open wide for you
So come to me, my baby

[Chorus]
You've got a way
Like JFK when you do it
The way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you've got a soul like no one I know
You're so new at it
The way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart, and it drives me crazy

[Outro]
It drives me crazy
It drives me crazy
Crazy, oh, oh-oh

[Intro]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 1]
Is the sun in your eyes, easy rider?
Do the flame-colored skies light your fire?
We are heavy metal lions
They will never understand
The kind of people you or I am
Bow your heads and take your hands

[Chorus]
They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)
They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)
They were angels forever
Forever angels
They were angels forever
Forever angels

[Verse 2]
Does the ocean inspire, easy rider?
Do the stars and the wind take you higher?
You are California proud
You are angels of the night
Rock 'n' roll guardians now
The last keepers of the light

[Chorus]
They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)
They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)
They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)
They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Bridge]
Paradise is a hell-colored flame sky
Is it nice to feel free and wild?
Paradise is a game of do or die
I just ride, ride, ride

[Chorus]
They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)
Forever angels
They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)
They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)
They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)

[Outro]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH LIKING THINGS THAT OTHER PEOPLE LIKE. SOLIDARITY CAN BE COOL. I’M NOT JUDGING YOU. YOU’RE STILL AN INDIVIDUAL. I’LL EVEN CALL YOU ‘INDIE’ IF THAT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER
Could you ever, ever submerge
Yourself in game
Like I could?
Would you ever, ever
Blow yourself up to the ceiling?
Were you screaming?
I was screaming
I was calling
From under your feet

Well I never replied
It's never you
It's always me
Course you're in the night
They never see
They never see
Me in the right

Now it tangles and breaks all over me
The stormy scene on the weekdays the usual
Oh I find it hard to get away from trouble
But I think about a sign
The aspirations in my life have gotten on the double
When will it be right
Will it be right
And it won't be right
It's closer
I was suppressed
The noose's call
To a name
No end
And it will regrow a limb
Now I will be intruding

Well I find it hard to get away from trouble
But I think of my sight
The aspirations in my life have gotten on the double
Will it be right
Will it be right
It won't be right

The thing has reached your society
What about the priority
The sky's about to fall and destroy your part
Now you have to find your own way
Through the raucous row

It's closer
I was suppressed
The noose's call
To a name
No end
And it will regrow a limb
And I will be intruding

[Intro: T.I.]
Ayy this my message to the government
Coming from the king of the southern scene
It's time for y'all to listen, you better listen to me

[Verse 1: T.I.]
You might of seen me on the tube, with your little son or daughter's eyes glued
To the screen, but hey it ain't as bad as it seem
Now could you imagine in your wildest dreams
Coming from nothin, now to somethin out your wildest dreams
Been hustling since the pre-teens, must be in my genes
9 in my starter coat, bout a G in my jeans
It's a reason why the streets crowned me as the king
And why robber crews don't mind seeing the bling
Man I'm a seven time felon, I could be in between
From running through houses and hearing fifty thousand scream
My name, sing the same song, that I spit flames on
Broads show the body parts they tattooed my name on
Hey I think you mother fuckers got the game wrong
I came to bring game to the game and turn the lame wrong
You sucka niggas keep hating, I'mma flame on
Whenever there's a fire, sire's who they place the blame on

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Ayy, okay, first thing's first, fuck what you think you know about me
Crack-pusher, petty thief, man that's so not me
You heard the album, read a magazine, oh I see
Well I've got a past I don't care to repeat
But I ain't half as bad as niggas you comparing to me
Rich and police still a nigga, that's apparent to me
But transition from the streets, I know you rarely will see
That's duly noted, still your profile is embarrassing me
Got me under investigation because of my associations
With niggas I barely know by they faces, ain't no relation
I mean, for Pete's sake, how much pressure from the police in each state
Can a young G take? I'm dying to eat steak, with a mill in each safe
A crib with a gate, so my kids can be safe
Trying to fly straight, but these chances I take
Could end a good night or ruin a nice day
And watch it, you gonna see, you're barking up the wrong tree
Just cuz I'm a seven time felon, homie
In addition to the lies snitches telling on me
That don't mean you can put the dope they was selling on me, nigga

[Verse 1]
I can't let nothing come in between the two of us
'Cause it's like you're all I need since we've been together
And, whenever I'm in need of a little love
It's okay for me to open up
But I just can't give my heart to anyone, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Some only come in your life for a season
And stay a while, giving you a reason
To take temporary and think that it's forever
But you've given me someone that I can believe in
I know that there will be times we can't come to an agreement
But I know we'll figure out the ups and downs
Tell me, are you willing to take a chance?
Baby, if so...

[Chorus]
(Here we go, here we go)
Let me put you in my hands
(Come on, come on)
I wanna be your man
Let's do it right so that you'll be with me a lifetime
('Cause you know and I know)
You know I ain't talking crazy
(Come on)
Your mama and my mama want some grand-babies tonight
Would you be with me for a lifetime?

[Verse 2]
I used to think it was hopeless and I should just give it up (give it up)
But I couldn't stop until I found myself a good girl (to be in love)
I checked every state and city and looked all around the world
And I'm proud to say that my search ends here
'Cause you're one in a million to me
And I can't let you go, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Some only come in your life for a season
And stay a while, giving you a reason
To take temporary and think that it's forever
But you've given me someone that I can believe in
I know that there will be times we can't come to an agreement
But I know we'll figure out the ups and downs
Tell me, are you willing to take a chance?
Baby, if so...

[Chorus]
(Here we go, here we go)
Let me put you in my hands
(Come on, come on)
I wanna be your man
Let's do it right so that you'll be with me a lifetime
('Cause you know and I know)
You know I ain't talking crazy
(Come on)
Your mama and my mama want some grand-babies tonight
Would you be with me for a lifetime?

[Interlude]
Listen, seasons are truly meant to chance
However, love can be the reason you fall
And when you find that special someone
You'll be willing to give them a lifetime
I love you and I choose you
Follow me

[Pre-Chorus]
Some only come in your life for a season
And stay a while, giving you a reason
To take temporary and think that it's forever
But you've given me someone that I can believe in
I know that there will be times we can't come to an agreement
But I know we'll figure out the ups and downs
Tell me, are you willing to take a chance?
Baby, if so...

[Chorus]
(Here we go, here we go)
Let me put you in my hands
(Come on, come on)
I wanna be your man
Let's do it right so that you'll be with me a lifetime
('Cause you know and I know)
You know I ain't talking crazy
(Come on)
Your mama and my mama want some grand-babies...

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Come on y'all, Light up a candle
This ones for everybody that lost somebody
From the cribs to the grave to the end of the road
May god bless they soul but life goes on
I know it's probably hard and you might go through it
But life don't stop you got to keep on movin'
I'm blowin' wishes to the sky and for all of my niggas
I'm blowin' lines to the sky and I'm pourin' out liquor
Hey

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
This for my niggas on the other side
That died young and didn't make it out to see 25
Fell victim to a homicide
Murder scene yellow tape
Family members momma cry
Same scenario, it's scary though
Happenin' in the hood every day but we don't fear it though
Rest in peace to these obituaries like a merry-go
Cause it's goin round and round
State to state, town to town
Every minute on the clock somebody heart stop
And every day that's in the year someone disappear
Thinkin' on the days they coulda hit me there
No religion prayin god was good enough to keep me here
My dad died when I was young
Seen the casket rollin down into the ground, I was done
Dark nights their, turned me into a moon instead of sun
To goon instead of young nigga with a school dream

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Come on y'all, Light up a candle
This ones for everybody that lost somebody
From the cribs to the grave to the end of the road
May god bless they soul but life goes on
I know it's probably hard and you might go through it
But life don't stop you got to keep on movin'
I'm blowin' wishes to the sky and for all of my niggas
I'm blowin' lines to the sky and I'm pourin' out liquor
Hey

[Verse 2: Ms. Jade]
Me ask me was I gon' cry, motherfuckin right I will
I was cryin in the parkin lot, tear on the steerin' wheel
Shades on so no one would see my eyes puffy
2 months since I'm changin', I still ain't over it
No I ain't finished mournin', cryin like every morning
Think about her everyday, wishin I was in the moment
Wishin she was still here instead of these lame niggas
Why the fuck they still here, why he have to take my sister
To see you on, yeah I know I gotta do it
So I drink to take the pain away, stop me from goin' through it
But it don't and it can't and they never understand
They shot my best friend in the head, she ain't even have a chance
Ain't never get to get married, never get to give birth
Never get to see me make it and man this shit hurt
Uh but ride along, lay up song
Ain't plan on gettin on this song but I did it for her
R.I.P

[Hook: Young Steff]
Come on y'all, Light up a candle
This ones for everybody that lost somebody
From the cribs to the grave to the end of the road
May god bless they soul but life goes on
I know it's probably hard and you might go through it
But life don't stop you got to keep on movin'
I'm blowin' wishes to the sky and for all of my niggas
I'm blowin' lines to the sky and I'm pourin' out liquor
Hey

[Hook: Meek Mill & Young Steff]
Come on y'all, Light up a candle

May god bless they soul but life goes on
I know it's probably hard and you might go through it
But life don't stop you got to keep on movin'
I'm blowin' wishes to the sky and for all of my niggas
I'm blowin' lines to the sky and I'm pourin' out liquor
Hey

[Verse 1]
In this age of grand delusion
You walked into my life out of my dreams
I don't need another change
Still you forced a way into my scheme of things
You say we're growing
Growing heart and soul
In this age of grand delusion
You walked into my life out of my dreams
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Oh sweet name, I call you again
You're born once again for me
Just because I believe don't mean I don't think as well
Don't have to question everything in Heaven or Hell

[Chorus]
Lord, I kneel and offer you my word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Lord, Lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things?

[Verse 2]
In this age of grand delusion
You walked into my life out of my dreams
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Just as long as I can see
I'll never stop this vision flowing
I look twice and you're still glowing
Just as long as I can walk
I'll walk beside you, I'm alive in you
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
And I'm ready to shape the scheme of things

[Bridge]
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh...

[Chorus]
Lord, I kneel and offer you my word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Oh Lord, Lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
But it's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Lord, Lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things?
My names is James and I am a little boy
Who used to have fun and lots of joy
Then my parents were eaten and died
I was lonely and wanted to hide
I had to live with two aunts, that was old and mean
I didn’t know, “Better days was going to be seen”
I felt sad and I ran away
That was the beginning of a better day
I met an old man that gave me a gift
It was going to make my life great and swift
Running home fast as I could
Not as careful as I should
The gift of green things came pouring out
I knew they was gone without a shadow of a doubt
They were absorbed in the ground
I was sad and didn’t make a sound
Before our eyes, a peach began to grow
All my aunts could think about was making some doe
People paid to see the peach
It was fenced out of everyone’s reach
I could not come out or get fed
I had to stay inside on my bed
I was made to go outside to clean
It was amazing what my eyes seen
The peach was big as a house
I was amazed and quiet as a mouse
To my surprise there was a hole
I was curious so I became bold
I touched the peach and crawled inside
Not knowing I would be going for a ride
Inside were lots of life size bugs
And i thought who are these mugs
All of them knew my name
And I thought what a crazy sick game
They started laughing and talking to me
Oh my God, a better life was going to be
They were friendly and kind
They are going to be friends of mine
No more sadness and tears
I was going to have some happy years
As the peach began to rock and roll
I knew a story would be told

[Intro]
Free at last, free at last
Thank God almighty, I'm free at last

[Verse 1]
I'm alright
'Cause you're here tonight
Thank God almighty
Everything's alright
It's been a long, long climb
Glad I made it over
Can't stop myself from crying
Feeling all wrapped up in clover

[Chorus]

Pain we can defeat

Honey has never been so sweet

Walking up and down the street, waving their hands and I'm

[Intro]
Better slow down baby
I’m out here wildin'
Better slow down baby
Shit is crazy

Hook]
You need to slow down baby
My whole team cash and load out baby
I’m a hero in my home town, baby
Stop talking, just go down, baby

[Verse 1]
Shit on my chest, shoot colors like a care bear
All year see me tan, hopping out the van
You wasn’t there, now you tryna show face
Fuck around, be a cold case
Chrome skates on an old day
Remote control chains, promote dough for the veins
Poke chicks, hoes with vogue legs
Eat steaks off a gold plate, stoned, listening to Coldplay

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Bronson Let Me Get In
You Needa Slow Down, Baby
Its Yung Malik Shout Out To My NIggas In Philly
QuietMoney Make It Rain
Ballin like Kobe Buckets I get cash
Real Niggas Make It Like It Nothing
Going Up In Niggas House Hoping We BankRoll
This Shit Strictly 4 My Peeps!!!

[Verse 2 Bronson]
Long knife by the spinal, built like a rhino
Push the 635 to the finals
Pearl white like what you sniffin’ in your sinus
The finest vaginas demolished by my dick
One yea
