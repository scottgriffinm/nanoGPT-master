r from Queens to the top
Cream of the crop, serve a fiend out my sock
Five minutes till they lean like the drop
Now they spinning through the furnace like the scene from The Rock
Hide spinach like a doomsday prepper
Every Sunday in my Tuesday leather
Now my beard look like Uday and Qusay
Play the pool on a cool day

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
A lot of people with their hands out now
Got these motherfuckers mad ‘cause I’mma stand out now
You never let the hammer off, you got the soft hands
I hear you singing for the boss man, dog
I’m from a lost land, spill coke on the heater
Drop a little sauce on the beater
Zero to 60 in a Porsche like a cheetah
New York, I'm like Jeter, light Caesar
No hypebeaster, rock a nice sneaker
You get drugs for a good price
My price cheaper, guaranteed
My trunk snapping like a tambourine
Bodying these pussies with a camera team

Uh! You better slow down, baby
Uh! You better slow down, baby
Uh! You better slow down, baby
You better slow down, baby

You need to slow down baby
I'm a hero in my home town, baby
Recently there’s been a trend that includes rappers saying something offensive, only to be attacked for it in the media and pressured to apologize. I have to be completely honest and say there’s a part of me that resents that. I view rap similar to how I view comedy. It’s going to ruffle feathers at times. It’s going to go “too far”. I do not believe that an apology is needed every time someone is offended, especially when that apology is really only for the sake of saving an endorsement or cleaning up bad press.

With that said, this is not the case today. This letter is sincere.
This apology IS necessary.

In a recent verse on the song “Jodeci Freestyle”, I said something
highly offensive to people with Autism. Last week, when I first saw a comment from someone outraged about the lyric, I realized right away that what I said was wrong. I was instantly embarrassed that I would be ignorant enough say something so hurtful. What makes the crime worse is that I should have known better.

To the entire Autism community who expressed outrage, I’m moved and inspired by your passion, and I’m amazed at how strong you are as a unit. I have now read stories online from parents about their struggles and triumphs with raising an Autistic child and I admire how incredibly strong you have to be to do so. It’s touching. It also makes what I said even more embarrassing for me. I feel real shame. You have every right to be angry.

To anyone suffering from Autism, either mildly or severely, I am sorry. I’m bound to make mistakes in my life, but in my heart I just want to spread Love.

I want to educate myself more on Autism, and I’ll gladly own my mistake and serve as an example to today’s generation that there’s nothing cool about mean-spirited comments about someone with Autism. People with this disorder and their loved ones have to go through so much already, the last thing they need is to hear something as ignorant as what I said. I understand.

To the parents who are fighting through the frustrations that must
come with raising a child with severe autism, finding strength and
patience that they never knew they had; to the college student with Asperger’s Syndrome; to all those overcoming Autism. You deserve medals, not disrespect. I hope you accept my sincere apology.

Much Love

-Cole

[Chorus]
I hear these kids and they tryin' to spit
But they sound so ass and I am the shit
No, you got nothin' on me, boy
(No-no-no-nothin' on me, boy, no-nothin' on me)
You got nothin' on me, boy
(No-no-no-nothin' on me, boy, no-nothin' on me)
They tell they friends that they're gonna blow
Once they on the stage, everybody go home
No, you got nothin' on me, boy
(No-no-no-nothin' on me, boy, no-nothin' on me)
You got nothin' on me, boy
(No-no-no-nothin' on me, boy, no-nothin' on me)

[Verse 1]
The youngin spittin' like tobacco, sharper than X-ACTO
Knives, flow tighter than a lasso
Louis shades on, my movie star shit
Lookin' like I'm dressed for the fuckin' red carpet
You look like your outfit from Target
With a bitch that smell like a armpit
Damn, that pussy stink, need to keep it clean
Do it like a kids movie
Homie, keep it G, PG-13, TV big screen
Been gettin' money since the boy was fifteen
But I spend it when I get it, Q wantin' me to save it
But I tend to wanna blow it when I make it
Used to drop verses in a dirty-ass basement
Now I'm recordin' at places that Lil Wayne spit
Shit, the future seem brighter than some neon
Bitch, I'm just a dog tryna find a tree to pee on
Infinity and beyond, beyond
Thinkin' you can beat me? Dream on, dream on
I'm so hard, got more bars than a damn jail yard
You slow like them damn little snails are
Now you in space with a star
So just chill for a second, play the background
Haha, it's time to make room for the class clown

[Chorus]
I hear these kids and they tryin' to spit
But they sound so ass and I am the shit
No, you got nothin' on me, boy
(No-no-no-nothin' on me, boy, no-nothin' on me)
You got nothin' on me, boy
(No-no-no-nothin' on me, boy, no-nothin' on me)
They tell they friends that they're gonna blow
Once they on the stage, everybody go home
No, you got nothin' on me, boy
(No-no-no-nothin' on me, boy, no-nothin' on me)
You got nothin' on me, boy (I just wanna one-take it for ya, Jerm)
(No-no-no-nothin' on me, boy, no-nothin' on me; hey, look, uh)

[Verse 2]
Labelled as a young man, don't wanna get old
Little thing called hip-hop stuck on my soul
Bumpin' my shit comin' up to a show
Well, it seems this youngin here lookin' like a pro
Now I look fresh, but I always had hoes
We the style, yeah, always had those
Gone so long, now I'm comin' back home
So many calls, gotta get another phone
Just to deal with the day-to-day routine
But I'll always make a little time to dream
Come with me, you could learn a few things
No, I'm good, don't need a mood ring
Hey, hip-hop's little brother like Phonte
Little league, no Danny Almonte
Bomb haze got me risin' like Andre
Chillin', countin' money with a couple of my hombres

[Chorus]
I hear these kids and they tryin' to spit
But they sound so ass and I am the shit
No, you got nothin' on me, boy
(No-no-no-nothin' on me, boy, no-nothin' on me)
You got nothin' on me, boy
(No-no-no-nothin' on me, boy, no-nothin' on me)
They tell they friends that they're gonna blow
Once they on the stage, everybody go home
No, you got nothin' on me, boy
(No-no-no-nothin' on me, boy, no-nothin' on me)
You got nothin' on me, boy
(No-no-no-nothin' on me, boy, no-nothin' on me)

[Lady Gaga]
I am a sinner who’s probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe

[Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don’t know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me then put me on stages
To me that’s amazing
To you that’s a quick check with all disrespect let me say this

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain stuck in a box
I'mma break out and then hide every lock
I'mma break out and then hide every lock

[Bridge] + 

[Hook]

[Lady Gaga]
I am a human who’s probably gonna fault again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
I realize as I lay down to sleep
We haven't spoken in weeks
So many things that I'd like to know
Come have a talk with me
I need a sign, something I can see
Why all the mystery?
I try not to fall for make believe
But what is reality?
Where do we go?
What do we know?
Life has to have a meaning
Show me the light
Show me the way
Show that you're listening

Show me that you love me
Show me that you walk with me
Hopefully, just above me
Heaven's watching over me

Guess it's funny how I say thanks to you
For all you've given me
Sometimes the price of what you gave to me
I can't stop questioning
O God of love, peace, and mercy
Why so much suffering?
I pray for the world, it gets worse to me
Wonder if you're listening
When people go
Why do they go?
Why don't you choose me?
But someday I know
I'm gonna go
I hope you're waiting for me
Show me that you love me
Show me that you walk with me
Hopefully, just above me
Heaven's watching over me

Maybe we'll talk
Some other night
Right now I'll take it easy
Won't spend my time
Waiting to die
Enjoy the life I'm living

Show me that you love me
Show me that you walk with me
Hopefully, just above me
Heaven's watching over me
Show me that you love me
Show me that you walk with me
Hopefully, just above me
Heaven's watching over me, oh

[Verse 1: Don Henley]
Raven hair and ruby lips
Sparks fly from her fingertips
Echoed voices in the night
She's a restless spirit on an endless flight

[Chorus]
Woo hoo, witchy woman
See how high she flies
Woo hoo, witchy woman
She got the moon in her eye

[Verse 2: Don Henley]
She held me spellbound in the night (Woo-ooh)
Dancing shadows and firelight
Crazy laughter in another room (Woo-ooh)
And she drove herself to madness with a silver spoon

[Chorus]
Woo hoo, witchy woman
See how high she flies
Woo hoo, witchy woman
She got the moon in her eye

[Verse 3: Don Henley]
Well, I know you want a lover, let me tell you brother
She's been sleeping in the devil's bed
And there's some rumors going round, someone's underground
She can rock you in the night time 'til your skin turns red

[Chorus]
Woo hoo, witchy woman
See how high she flies
Woo hoo, witchy woman
She got the moon in her eye

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I don't wanna wake up alone
(Sometimes I don't wanna wake up alone)
But sometimes I wanna wake up and be on my own
(But sometimes I wanna wake up and be on my own)
Sometimes I don't wanna walk by and smile
(Sometimes I don't wanna walk by and smile)
But at the same time, I don't wanna let people down
(But at the same time, I don't wanna let people down)

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh) Can you imagine, the weight of a world
(Ooh) Placed on your shoulders, trapped in this world?
(Ooh) And no one can reach you (Ooh), ooh
(Ooh) So no one can help you now (Ooh)

[Chorus]
It's getting heavy, I think I'm 'bout ready to break down (Down)
I'm standing up (Up), but I'm fallin' down (Down)
Time keeps on ticking, I wish there was a way to slow it down (Down)
Someone pick me up (Up) 'cause I'm fallin' down (Down)
Fallin' down (Down) down (Down) down (Down) down (Down)
Fallin' down (Down) down (Down) down (Down) down

[Verse 2]
Why is it so easy for you to blame?
I'm only human, we're all the same
I've given up everything in exchange for being alone
I'm shaking these demons underneath all the pride, oh-woah

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh) Can you imagine, the weight of a world
(Ooh) Placed on your shoulders, trapped in this world?
(Ooh) And no one can reach you (Ooh), ooh
(Ooh) So no one can help you now (Ooh)

[Chorus]
It's getting heavy, I think I'm 'bout ready to break down (Oh, down)
I'm standing up (Standing up), but I'm fallin' down (Down)
Time keeps on ticking, I wish there was a way to slow it down (Slow it down)
Someone pick me up (Pick me up) 'cause I'm fallin' down (Fallin' down, yeah)

Fallin' down (Down) down (Down) down (Down) down
Fallin' down (Down) down (Down) down (Down) down (Down)
Fallin' down (Down) down (Down) down (Down) down

Time keeps on ticking, I wish there was a way to slow it down (Down)
Someone pick me up (Up) 'cause I'm fallin' down (Down)
It's getting heavy, I think I'm 'bout ready to break down (Down)

[Verse 1]
Baby, I'm so into you
You got that something, what can I do?
Baby, you spin me around, oh
The earth is moving, but I can't feel the ground
Every time you look at me
My heart is jumping, it's easy to see
Loving you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before

[Chorus]
You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night
Oh

Tell me you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me I'm not in the blue, oh

Loving you means so much more

You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night

I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Crazy, but it feels alright
Every day and every night

Oh, crazy (You make me feel alright)
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up (Oh) all night

Don't go knock my door
Don't go knock my door

[Verse 1]
Time is up, no more cheat and lie
No more tears to dry
You and I, we're like so "bye-bye"
Finally, I am over you
Totally unblue

[Pre-Chorus]
When I can hear myself saying
I am better off without you
Stronger than ever and I
I'm telling you now

[Chorus]
Don't go knocking on my door
Gotta stay away, for sure
You say you miss me like crazy now
But I ain't buying that
You better get off my back
Don't go knocking on my door

[Verse 2]
I can see, it's no mystery
It's so clear to me, what we had is all history
It's okay, I can sleep at night
It will be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
I can hear myself saying
I am better off without you
Stronger than ever and I
I'm telling you now

[Chorus]
Don't go knocking on my door (Baby)
Gotta stay away, for sure
You say you miss me like crazy now
But I ain't buying that
You better get off my back
Don't go knocking on my door (Door)
Gotta stay away, for sure
You say you miss me like crazy now
But I ain't buying that
You better get off my back (Ooh, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
Don't go knock my door
Don't go knock my door
Don't go knock my door
Do what you want
As long as you don't come back
Don't go knocking on my door
Gotta stay away, for sure
And now I ain't buying that
You better get off my back

[Chorus]
Don't go knocking on my door (Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Gotta stay away, for sure
You say you miss me like crazy now
But I ain't buying that
You better get off my back
Don't go knocking on my door (Ooh, yeah)
Don't go knocking on my door
Gotta stay away, for sure (Gotta stay away, for sure)
You say you miss me like crazy now
But I ain't buying that
You better get off my back
Don't go knocking on my door

Britney: "Ok, ok, ok, ok, so listen, listen so then he goes, no matter what I do for you it never seems to be enough... ew! I can't believe he said that. You don't think I'm like that do you?"
Friend: "Well, you are..."
Britney: "What?! don't tell me you agree with him. Oh my God, oh my God!"
Friend: "Well, I mean, one minute everything's fine and the next minute you're freaking out, it's like you never satisfied!"
Britney: "Well, I know I'm a little picky... but, hey, I just know what I want."

[Verse 1]
First man to die
For the flag we now hold high
Was a Black man
The ground where we stand
With a flag held in our hand
Was first the red man's
Guide of a ship
On the first Columbus trip
Was a brown man
The railroads for trains
Came on tracking that was laid
By the yellow man

[Chorus]
We pledge allegiance
All our lives
To the magic colors
Red, blue, and white
But we all must be given
The liberty that we defend
For with justice not for all men
History will repeat again

This world was made for all men

First clock to be made
In America was created
By a Black man

And the leader with a pen
Signed his name to free all men
Was a white man

[Chorus]
We pledge allegiance
All our lives
To the magic colors
Red, blue, and white
But we all must be given
The liberty that we defend
For with justice not for all men
History will repeat again
It's time we learned
This world was made for all men
World was made for all men
This world was made for all men
World was made for all men

[Verse 4]

I need space, love
I need... me
(Action!)

[Verse 1]
Say hello to the girl that I am
You're gonna have to see through my perspective
I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am
And I don't wanna be so damn protected

[Pre-Chorus]
There must be another way
'Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say what a girl is to do?
God, I need some answers

[Chorus]
What am I to do with my life? (You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right? (You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected

[Verse 2]
I'll tell 'em what I like, what I want, and what I don't
But every time I do, I stand corrected
Things that I've been told, I can't believe what I hear about the world
I realize I'm overprotected

[Pre-Chorus]
There must be another way
'Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say what a girl is to do?

Mmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
My friends say you're so into me
And that you need me desperately
They say you say we're so complete
But I need to hear it straight from you
If you want me to believe it's true
I've been waiting for so long, it hurts
I wanna hear you say the words, please

[Chorus]
Don't, don't let me be the last to know
Don't hold back, just let it go
I need to hear you say
You need me all the way
Oh, if you love me so
Don't let me be the last to know

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah, baby

[Verse 2]
Your body language says so much
Yeah, I feel it in the way you touch
But 'til you say the words, it's not enough
C'mon and tell me you're in love, please

[Chorus]
Don't, don't let me be the last to know
Don't hold back, just let it go
I need to hear you say
You need me all the way
Oh, if you love me so
Don't let me be the last to know, yeah

[Bridge]
C'mon, baby, c'mon, darling, ooh, yeah
C'mon, let me be the one
C'mon now, ooh
Oh, oh, yeah
(I need to hear you say) I need to hear you say
(You love me all the way) You love me all the way
(I don't wanna wait another day)
And I don't wanna wait another day
I wanna feel the way you feel, oh, c'mon

[Chorus]
Don't (Don't), don't let me be the last to know
(Just let me be the one)
Don't (Don't) hold back (Hold back), just let it go (Just let it go)
I need to hear you say (I need to hear you say)
You need me all the way (You need me all the way)
So baby, if you love me
(Don't, don't, don't) Let me be the last to know

[Verse 1]
You used to say that I was special
Everything was right
But now you think I'm wearing too much make-up
That my dress is too tight
You got no reasons to be jealous
I've never been untrue
So does it really matter if they're looking?
I'm only looking at you

[Pre-Chorus]
You should never try to change me
I can be nobody else
And I like the way I am

[Chorus]
What you see is what you get
This is me, hey, you
If you want me, don't forget
You should take me as I am
'Cause I can promise you
Baby, what you see is what you get

[Verse 2]
I know you watch me when I'm dancing
When I party with my friends
I can feel your eyes on my back, baby (Ah, na na)
I can't have no chains around me, baby, can't you see?
I could be anything you dream of, but I gotta feel free

[Pre-Chorus]
You should never try to change me
I can be nobody else
And I like the way I am

[Chorus]
What you see is what you get
This is me, hey, you
If you want me, don't forget
You should take me as I am
'Cause I can promise you
Baby, what you see is what you get

[Pre-Chorus]
You should never try to change me
I can be nobody else
Believe me, you’ll be looking for trouble
If you hurt me
I can promise you, you’ll be looking for trouble
Believe me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
What you see is what you get
This is me, hey, you
Oh, if you want me, don't forget
You should take (you should take) me as I am, yeah, yeah
'Cause I can promise you
Baby, what you see is what you get
'Cause I can promise you
Baby, what you see is what you get

[Interlude to Lucky: Britney & Friend]
"Hey, what's up this is Brit
And I'm not in right now
So do your thang!
Beep! hehehe, I'm just kiddin'"
"Hehehe, yo Brit
You're a nerd, you really need to change that message
Look, I was thinking about that movie we saw the other night
You know, how she had all that fame, and all that money
And she still wasn't happy
Wouldn't that make a cool song?"

[Intro]
I'm dreaming of one kiss from you
A love long and true
We'll go on and on and
Hey, oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna hear that I'm too young
To know it's love that makes me feel this way
'Cause I don't have to feel the heat of the sun
To know it's shining on me every day
When it's warm outside
And the look in your eyes
Is longing to show me the way, no, no
I don't want to wait

[Chorus]
Just one kiss from you, and suddenly (Yeah)
I see the road laid out in front of me
You give me strength, you give me hope
And when you hold me in your arms, you make me whole
And I don't know just what I would do
Without one kiss from you

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna hear my time will come
When it feels like it's already here
We should learn to walk before we run
But why go anywhere when you're so near?
'Cause when I reach out to you
So sad and confused
And feeling like I could cry
You dry my eyes

[Chorus]
Just one kiss from you, and suddenly (yeah)
I see the road laid out in front of me
You give me strength, you give me hope
And when you hold me in your arms, you make me whole
And I don't know just what I would do
Without one kiss from you

[Bridge]
I'm dreaming of one kiss from you
A love long and true
We'll go on and on and
I'm looking for one kiss goodnight
To last all my life
On and on and

[Chorus]
Just one kiss from you, and suddenly
I see the road laid out in front of me
You give me strength, you give me hope
And when you hold me in your arms
You make me whole
And I don't know just what I would do
Without one kiss from you

[Outro]
I'm looking for one kiss goodnight
To last all my life

[Verse 1]
Calling out your name
Your face is everywhere
I'm reaching out to you
To find that you're not there
I wake up every night to see the state I'm in
It's like an endless fight I never seem to win

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't go on as long as I believe
Can't let go when I keep wondering

[Chorus]
Where are you now, what have you found?
Where is your heart when I'm not around?
Where are you now? You gotta let me know
Oh, baby, so I can let you go

[Verse 2]
I can hear your voice
The ring of yesterday
It seems so close to me
But yet so far away
I should let it out
To save what's left of me
And close the doors of doubt
Revive my dignity, but

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't go on as long as I believe (As long as I believe)
Can't let go when I keep wondering (where are you)

[Chorus]
Where are you now, what have you found?
Where is your heart when I'm not around?
Where are you now? You gotta let me know
Oh, baby, so I can let you go

[Bridge]
I should let it out, it's time to let you go
Oh, baby, I just wanna know

[Chorus]
Where are you now, what have you found? (you now)
Where is your heart when I'm not around? (where is your heart when I'm not around?)
Where are you now? You gotta let me know
Oh, baby, so I can let you go
Where are you now, what have you found? (where are you now, what have you found?)
Where is your heart when I'm not around? (where is your heart when I'm not around?)
Where are you now? You gotta let me know (where are you now? Gotta let me know)
Oh, baby, so I can let you go (let you go)

[Intro]
I'm just a girl with a crush on you

[Verse 1]
I don't care about money
It doesn't give me half the thrill
To the thought of you, honey
So tell me that you want me still

[Pre-Chorus]
If only I could trade the fancy cars
For a chance today, it's incomparable
I might be sitting with the movie stars
Everybody say that I have it all

[Chorus]
But I can't make you love me
Is it my life or the things I do?
Can't make you love me
I'm just a girl with a crush on you

[Verse 2]
I have been through changes, yeah
But I'm still the girl you used to know
It's made me no different
So tell me why you had to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, baby, I will trade the fancy cars
For a chance today, it's incomparable
I might be sitting with the movie stars
Everybody say that I just have it all

[Chorus]
But I can't make you love me
Is it my life or the things I do?
Can't make you love me
I'm just a girl with a crush on you, babe
(Alright, yeah, yeah, alright)

[Bridge]
Just the thought of being close to you
It's incomparable
Should be happy with the life I live
And the things I do
Seems like I have it all

[Chorus]
Can't make you, make you love me, baby
Is it my life or the things I do?
Can't make you love me (Alright)
I'm just a girl with a crush on you
But I can't make you love me (Make you love me, baby)
Is it my life or the things I do? (Can't make you love me)
Can't make you love me
I'm just a girl with a crush on you
I'm just a girl with a crush on you

[Verse 1]
I love to hear you say that you love me
With words so sweet
And I love the way with just one whisper
You tell me everything
And when you say those words
It's the sweetest thing I've ever heard

[Chorus]
But when your eyes say it
That's when I know that it's true
I feel it
I feel the love coming through
I know it
I know that you truly care for me
'Cause it's there to see
When your eyes say it

[Verse 2]
I love all the ways that you show me
You'll never leave
And the way your kisses, they always convince me
Your feelings run so deep
I love the things you say
And I love the love your touch conveys

[Chorus]
But when your eyes say it
That's when I know that it's true
I feel it
I feel the love coming through
I know it
I know that you truly care for me
'Cause it's there to see
When your eyes tell me
I know they're not tellin' lies
They tell me
All that you're feelin' inside
And it sounds so right
When your eyes say it

[Bridge]
And the words that say take my breath away
No song ever sounded so sweet
I love every word that they say to me

[Chorus]
But when your eyes say it
That's when I know that it's true
I feel it
I feel the love coming through
I know it
I know that you truly care for me
'Cause it's there to see
When your eyes tell me
I know they're not tellin' lies
They tell me
All that you're feelin' inside
And it sounds so right
When your eyes say it
That's when I know that it's true
I feel it
I feel the love coming through
I know it
I know that you truly care for me
'Cause it's there to see
When your eyes tell me
I know they're not tellin' lies
They tell me
All that you're feelin' inside
And it sounds so right

[Verse 1]
To think I'm so naive
How dare you play with me?
I gave you heart and soul, yeah
Tell me baby, please
Why you screwing with my head?
I don't think you understand
I won't take your (huh) no more
Don't knock on my door

[Pre-Chorus]
Not this time, because I recognize
I've heard it all before, and I

[Chorus]
I think of all the time that I wasted
Think of all the times that I took you back
Ain't no way I'll be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in
Let's just face it
Better off alone and I won't turn back
You thought that I would be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in

[Verse 2]
Don't tell me how to feel
Or say that you're for real
My mind's made up, I'm cool without ya
You got no more appeal
Now this girl don't need no man
To say what she can do or what she can't
Now I live for me
Boy, does that make you weep?

[Pre-Chorus]
Not this time, because I realize
I've heard it all before, and I

[Chorus]
I think of all the time that I wasted
Think of all the times that I took you back
Ain't no way I'll be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in
Let's just face it
Better off alone and I won't turn back
You thought that I would be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in

[Bridge]
Think of times you made me cry
You had me so confused
I'm tired of trying, I'll leave behind this
What's a girl to do?

[Verse 3]
I think of all the times you made me sick
I used to think I couldn't handle it
What you think, I'm just another chick?
Messed with Brit, boy, you must have tripped
What were you thinking when you lost my trust?
You had it all, now you're left with nothing
Ooh, baby, now I know you want my touch
And now you're lonely and you still want me

[Chorus]
I think of all the time that I wasted
Think of all the times that I took you back
Ain't no way I'll be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in
Let's just face it
Better off alone and I won't turn back
You thought that I would be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in
Think of all the time that I wasted
Think of all the times that I took you back
Ain't no way I'll be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in
Let's just face it
Better off alone and I won't turn back
You thought that I would be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in

[Chorus]
Dear diary
Today I saw a boy
And I wondered if he noticed me
He took my breath away

[Verse 1]
Dear diary
I can't get him off my mind
And it scares me 'cause I've never felt this way
No one in this world
Knows me better than you do
So diary, I'll confide in you

[Chorus]
Dear diary
Today I saw that boy
As he walked by, I thought he smiled at me

[Verse 2]
And I wondered
Does he know what's in my heart?
I tried to smile, but I could hardly breathe
Should I tell him how I feel
Or would that scare him away?
Diary, tell me what to do
Please tell me what to say

[Chorus]
Dear diary
One touch of his hand
Now I can't wait to see that boy again
He smiled
And I thought my heart could fly
Diary, do you think that we'll be more than friends?
I've got a feeling we'll be so much more than friends

[Verse 1]
You try to read me, you try to figure out
You try to breathe me, but you can't blow me out
You try to feel me, but I'm so out of touch
I won't be falling, you won't have to pick me up

[Pre-Chorus]
Sorry if I sound confused, I don't feel the way you do
But I won't turn around, but I won't turn around

[Chorus]
Think that I might back down, but I won't
Think that I might have doubts, but I don't
No insecurities
Won't you just let me, let me be?
Think that you know me now, but you don't
Think that I can't stand on my own
Ain't my philosophy
Won't you just let me, let me be?

[Verse 2]
Trust in my instincts, trust that I know what's right
These are the reasons that keep you up at night (At night)
Tell me, "Go slow, this is my flow"
'Cause you don't know, know what I know
Let me tell you how it feels
Baby, it's time that you've seen me for real

[Pre-Chorus]
Sorry if I sound confused, I don't feel the way you do
But I won't turn around (won't turn around)
But I won't turn around

[Chorus]
Think that I might back down, but I won't
Think that I might have doubts, but I don't
No insecurities
Won't you just let me, let me be?
Think that you know me now, but you don't
Think that I can't stand on my own
Ain't my philosophy
Won't you just let me, let me be?

[Verse 3]
Trust that I know, this is my show
Letting you know, gotta go the way I go
Trust that I know, this is my show
Letting you know, gotta go the way I go

[Chorus]
Think that I might back down, but I won't
Think that I might have doubts, but I don't
No insecurities
Won't you just let me, let me be?
Think that you know me now, but you don't
Think that I can't stand on my own
Ain't my philosophy (It ain't my philosophy)
Won't you just let me, let me be?
Think that I might back down, but I won't
Think that I might have doubts, but I don't
No insecurities (No insecurities)
Won't you just let me, let me be?
Think that you know me now, but you don't
Think that I can't stand on my own
(Think that I can't stand on my own)
Ain't my philosophy
Won't you just let me, let me be?

[Verse 1]
There's a girl in the mirror
I wonder who she is
Sometimes I think I know her
Sometimes I really wish I did
There's a story in her eyes
Lullabies and goodbyes

[Pre-Chorus]
When she's looking back at me
I can tell her heart is broken easily

[Chorus]
'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright
Oh, the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
Something I could do

[Verse 2]
If I could, I would tell her
Not to be afraid
The pain that she's feeling
The sense of loneliness will fade
So dry your tears and rest assured
Love will find you like before

[Pre-Chorus]
When she's looking back at me
I know nothing really works that easily

[Chorus]
'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonight
And there’s nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright
Oh, the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
I wish there was something
Oh, I wish there was something I could do

[Bridge]
I can't believe it's what I see
That the girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror
Is me
I can't believe what I see
(That the girl in my mirror)
That the girl in the mirror
Is me
Oh, is me

[Chorus]
'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright
Oh, the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
I wish there was something
Oh, I wish there was something I could do

[Verse 1]
I, I was the game he would play
He brought the clouds to my day
Then like a ray of light
You came my way one night
Just one look and I knew

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You would make everything clear
Make all the clouds disappear
Put all your fears to rest
Who do I love the best?
Don't you know?
Don't you know?

[Chorus]
You've got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey, it's true
There's just you
You must have been Heaven sent
Hearing me call
You were out on a limb
And you're all that he's not
Just look what I've got
'Cause you've got it all
Over him

[Post-Chorus]
All over
You've got it all over
All over
You've got it all over

[Verse 2]
No, don't let him worry you so
Once I met you, I let go
Oh, you can surely see
You're so much more to me
Just one look and I knew

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You would make everything clear
Make all the clouds disappear
You're better than all the rest
Who do I love the best? Yeah
Don't you know?
Don't you know?

[Chorus]
You've got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey, it's true
There's just you
You must have been Heaven sent
Hearing me call
You were out on a limb (Out on a limb)
And you're all that he's not (All that he's not)
Just look what I've got (Look what I've got)
'Cause you've got it all (You've got it all)
Over him
You've got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey, it's true (so true)
There's just you
You must have been Heaven sent
Hearing me call
You were out on a limb (Out on a limb)
And you're all that he's not (All that he's not)
Just look what I've got (Look what I've got)
'Cause you've got it all (You've got it all)
Over him

[Post-Chorus]
All over
You've got it all over
All over
You've got it all over him

[Verse 1]
I used to think I had the answers to everything
But now I know
That life doesn't always go my way, yeah
Feels like I'm caught in the middle
That's when I realized

[Chorus]
I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
All I need is time, a moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl

[Verse 2]
There is no need to protect me
It's time that I learn to face up to this on my own
I've seen so much more than you know now
So don't tell me to shut my eyes

[Chorus]
I'm not a girl (Not a girl, not yet a woman)
Not yet a woman
(I'm just trying to find the woman in me)
All I need is time, a moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl

[Bridge]
But if you look at me closely
You will see it in my eyes
This girl will always find her way

[Chorus]
(I'm not a girl) I'm not a girl, don't tell me what to believe
(Not yet a woman) I'm just trying to find the woman in me, yeah
(All I need is time) All I need is time, a moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl (Not a girl, not yet a woman)
Not yet a woman
(I'm just trying to find the woman in me) Not now
All I need is time, a moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman

[Verse 1]
Top down, on the strip
Looking in the mirror and I'm checking out my lipstick
Girlfriends up in the back
We're out for an all night
Feeling so crazy cool
Vibe so right, don't know if they're ready for it
Valet, baby, here's the keys
We're about to step inside

[Pre-Chorus]
Skip on the drinks, head to the floor
Making my way, that's for sure
My body's taken over, and I want some more
Whoa, oh, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'll be anticipating
This is our song they're playing
I wanna rock with you (Rock with you)
You're feeling this right, let's do this tonight

[Verse 2]
Step up, baby, don't be shy
I know you're feeling me, 'cause you're giving me the eye
And I don't wanna play around
Baby, watch me move
Check this, let's make a scene
Don't leave me waiting longer
Why you wanna make me long for ya?
Move it, baby, over here
So we can set it off

[Pre-Chorus]
We can get down to the DJ's sound
Feeling so good, baby, all around
Feeling kind of naughty, come and get me now
Whoa, oh, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'll be anticipating (Anticipating)
This is our song they're playing
I wanna rock with you

Gotta really let me know if you want me
You gotta turn me on and make me feel sexy
Gotta show me you got everything that I need
Gotta really let me know if you want me
You gotta turn me on and make me feel sexy
Gotta show me you got everything that I need
Oh, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
I'll be anticipating

I'll be anticipating
This is our song they're playing

[Bridge]
Gotta really let me know if you want me
You gotta turn me on and make me feel sexy
Gotta show me you got everything that I need
Gotta really let me know if you want me
You gotta turn me on and make me feel sexy
Gotta show me you got everything that I need

[Intro]
Hey, is this thing on?

[Verse 1]
I saw him dancing there by the record machine
I knew he must have been about seventeen
The beat was going strong
Playing my favorite song
I could tell it wouldn't be long 'til he was with me
Yeah, with me
I could tell it wouldn't be long 'til he was with me
Yeah, with me, singin'

[Chorus]
I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take the time, and dance with me, ow!

[Verse 2]
He smiled, so I got up and asked for his name
"But that don't matter," he said, "cause it's all the same"
He said, "Can I take you home, where we can be alone?"
And next we were moving on, and he was with me
Yeah, with me
And we were moving on, and singing that same ol' song
Yeah, with me, singin'

[Chorus]
I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take the time, and dance with me, ow!

[Bridge]
I love rock 'n' roll, yeah
'Cause it soothes my soul, yeah
I love rock 'n' roll
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I said, "Can I take you home, where we can be alone?"
And next we were moving on
And he was with me
Yeah, with me
And we were moving on
And singing that same ol' song
Yeah, with me, singin'

[Chorus]
I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take the time, and dance with me

So come and take the time, and dance with me

[Verse 1]
I used to be your girlfriend and I know I did it well
Oh yes, you know it's true
You'd call me Cinderella
All you had to do was yell, and I'd be there for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Here I am, so try to forgive me
I don't believe in fairytales
Here we are with nothing but honesty
I've had enough, I'm not gonna stay

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for running away like this
And I'm sorry, I've already made my wish
Aah, but Cinderella's got to go

[Verse 2]
From time to time, I tried to tell just what was on my mind
You'd tell me, "Not today"
"Come back, do that"
"Where's Cinderella at?"
Was all you had to say

[Pre-Chorus]
Here I am, so try to forgive me
I don't believe in fairytales
Here we are with nothing but honesty
I've had enough, I'm not gonna stay

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for running away like this
And I'm sorry, I've already made my wish
Aah, but Cinderella's got to go
I'm sorry, just trying to live my life
Don't worry, you're gonna be alright
But Cinderella's got to go

[Bridge]
I used to say I want you
You cast me in your spell
I did everything you wanted me to
But now I shall break free from all your lies
I won't be blind, you see
My love, it can't be sacrificed
I won't return to thee

[Post-Bridge]
I'm so sorry, I've already made up my mind
I won't return to thee
I'm sorry to say, I'm running away now
Don't worry, you will be alright
I'm running away, I've made up my mind now
You're gonna have to let me go

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for running away like this
And I'm sorry, I've already made my wish
Aah, but Cinderella's got to go
I'm sorry, just trying to live my life
Don't worry, you're gonna be alright
But Cinderella's got to go

[Verse 1]
I, I'm here to testify
That you're the only one I belong to
I don't know where to start, it turned into an art
Not to show the world that it was you
Who made me realize not to compromise
The fact that you and I should meet
(I know we're gonna get, know we're gonna get, get)

[Chorus]
Bombastic love, so fantastic
Where I’m completely yours, and you are mine
And it's gonna be exactly like in a movie
When we fall in love for the first time

[Verse 2]
Don't know why I feel so insecure
I never understood what it's good for
I've gotta make sure that weakness won't stop me again
I can't sit and wait anymore
You made me realize not to compromise
The fact that you and I should meet
(I know we're gonna get, know we're gonna get, get)

[Chorus]
Bombastic love, so fantastic
Where I’m completely yours, and you are mine
And it's gonna be exactly like in a movie
When we fall in love for the first time

[Bridge]
It's gonna be bombastic love
Everything is gonna be alright
When I'm yours and you are mine
It's gonna be a fantastic love
When I wake up, everything is still the same
And you don't even know my name

[Break]
I know it's gonna be

[Chorus]
Bombastic love, so fantastic
Where I’m completely yours, and you are mine
And it's gonna be exactly like in a movie
When we fall in love for the first time
(I know we're gonna get, know we're gonna get, get)
Bombastic love, so fantastic (Bombastic love, ooh yeah)
Where I’m completely yours, and you are mine (And you are mine)
And it's gonna be exactly like in a movie (Exactly like in the movies, baby)
When we fall in love for the first time

[Verse 1]
You thrive on dancing in our laps before the more familiar chaps
Who know the curtain leads to fever
We watched the womaniser cry, and in the last sip
You and I declared we might require a breather
I am the truth's true truant
I can feign excitement fluently as solid as I can busk shock
With well-presented merriment
And I know all too well I shouldn't break the key off in the lock

[Chorus]
And the tumble splits the frame
Revealing silk and fits
In the fright lined dining room
Throw a gaze towards them while they feast

[Verse 2]
The days drag their heels
When you're not there to crack the whip
And the weeks wait to burst like a sachet of brats
The old pantomime villain follows my coat
And he hides where it hangs
And he spies through the slats
And meanwhile in the desert's only costume shop
The cowls hang and wait to rot away the identities of the willing

[Verse 3]
So I'm back to sugar in the night
Rocketing shutter doors despite the shop not opening for hours
You can itch, flap and whistle and try to avoid the tock
As I scribbled over drivel, you were snoring; showing off

[Chorus]
The tumble splits the frame
Revealing silk and fits
In the fright lined dining room
Throw a gaze towards them while they feast

[Intro]
Oh baby, oh baby
Oh baby, oh baby

[Verse 1]
The love that all believe, I never found inside of me
Built these walls up so high, needed my room to breathe
Oh baby, oh baby, you tear them down
Can't believe you've changed my mind
Oh baby, oh baby, I saw your smile
Stay with me a while

[Chorus]
All things fall into place
My heart, it feels so safe
You are my melody
That's where you take me
With you, I get so high
Lost in the crystal sky
You are this melody
That's where you take me

[Verse 2]
I never fell before, how did you find my door?
The key to my soul, to you forever more
Oh baby, oh baby, you make me rise
And never did I once think twice
Oh baby, oh baby, you make me smile
Stay with me a while, oh

[Chorus]
All things fall in to place
My heart, it feels so safe
You are my melody
That's where you take me (That's where you take me)
With you, I get so high (I get so high)
Lost in the crystal sky (Crystal sky)
You are this melody
That's where you take me

[Bridge]
Afraid to let it all inside
Now I wanna hear you'll stay with me a while
Stay with me a while

[Post-Bridge]
La-la-la-la-la-la (La-la-la)
La-la-la-la-la-la (La-la-la)
La-la-la-la-la-la (La-la-la)
That's where you take me

[Chorus]
All things fall in to place
My heart, it feels so safe
You are my melody (Oh, baby)
That's where you take me (Where you, where you take me)
With you, I get so high
Lost in the crystal sky
You are this melody (Oh, baby)
That's where you take me
All things fall in to place
My heart, it feels so safe
You are my melody
That's where you take me
With you, I get so high
Lost in the crystal sky

[Verse 1]
When I got back from fixing my hair
You were directing the traffic
Letting your story slip on the snow
As if the transmission was automatic
It's arguable that I shouldn't've been there
It was fortunate timing
I had a hole in the pocket of my favourite coat
And my love dropped into the lining

[Chorus]
(Have you got your strange?) Not on me
I haven't got my strange
(Have you got your strange?) Not on me

[Verse 2]
You can't sleep until you've sat on the steps
To weep 'til you feel like you've wept, yeah
(As long as you don't forget your strange)

[Chorus]
(Have you got your strange?) No, not on me
I haven't got my strange
(Have you got your strange?) Not on me
I haven't got my strange
I've better fetch my strange
I haven't got my strange
I haven't got my strange

[Verse 1]
Take a little walk to the edge of town and go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms like a bird of doom as it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires and the humming wires
Well, you know you're never coming back
Past the square, past the bridge, past the mills, past the stacks

[Chorus]
On a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with a red right hand

[Verse 2]
He'll wrap you in his arms and tell ya that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all of those dreams it took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole, heal your shrinking soul
And there won't be a single thing that you can do
He's a god, he's a man, he's a ghost, he's a guru

[Chorus]
They're whispering his name 'cross this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat is a red right hand

[Verse 3]
You don't have no money? He'll get you some
If you haven't got no car, he'll get you one
You've got no self-respect, you feel like an insect
Well, don't you worry, buddy, 'cause here he comes
Through the ghetto and the barrows
And the Bowery and the slums

[Chorus]
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his red right hand

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
You'll see him in your nightmares, you'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere, but he's not what he seems
You'll see him in your head and on the TV screen
Hey, buddy, I'm warning you to turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god, he's a man, he's a guru

[Chorus]
You're one microscopic cog in his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by his red right hand

[Intro]
Do you know what it's like?
Come on, come on

[Verse 1]
Baby, tell me, do I
Look like the kinda girl that you wanna take home? Wanna make me your own?
Do you even know what I like?
Just what I'm living for, what I adore?

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, take the time to realize I'm not the kind to sacrifice the way I am
So, if you wanna be my man, baby

[Chorus]
Walk a mile in my shoes
Do me right or I'm through
Can't you see that if you want to stay around (I'm telling you)
You've got to figure me out? Boy
Take your time or you lose
This is my game, my rules
And I can see, obviously
Baby, you don't know what it’s like to be me

[Post-Chorus]
Do you know what it’s like?
Do you know what it’s like?

[Verse 2]
Don't you get it twisted, boy, I want you too
But you got my heart to win before I let you in
And this deceives you, baby, I'm not the average lady
I need someone to love

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, take the time to realize I'm not the kind to sacrifice the way I am
So, if you wanna be my man, baby

[Chorus]
Walk a mile in my shoes
Do me right, or I'm through
Can't you see that if you want to stay around (I'm telling you)
You've got to figure me out? Boy
Take your time or you lose
This is my game, my rules
And I can see, obviously
Baby, you don't know what it’s like to be me

[Bridge]
Baby, get to know me
Then you can show me that you love for me is true
And I'll give you everything that a girl could give
Don't you want to be my man? (Oh)

[Chorus]
Walk a mile in my shoes
Do me right, or I'm through
Can't you see that if you want to stay around (I'm telling you)
You've got to figure me out? Boy (You've got to figure me out, baby)
Take your time or you lose
This is my game, my rules (This is my game)
And I can see, obviously
Baby, you don't know what it’s like (B-B-B-Breakdown)
Walk a mile in my shoes
Do me right, or I'm through (This is my game, baby)
Can't you see that if you want to stay around (Although I ain't playin', sugar)
You've got to figure me out? (You, you've got to figure me out)
Take your time or you lose (Yeah, yeah)
This is my game, my rules (Yeah, oh)
And I can see, obviously
Baby, you don't know what it’s like to be me

[Verse 1]
I believe we all have one true love
Somewhere in this world, I do
When it seemed all my dreams were falling through
That's when I found you
I believe for every heart that whispers in the dark
There's a ray of light somewhere shining through
It was sink or swim when the tide came in
I found myself when I found you

[Chorus]
I found the closest thing to heaven
Yes, in you, I found the deepest love I knew
Ooh-ooh, oh, I believe, yes, it's true
I found myself when I found you
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 2]
I believe (I believe) for every door (Every door)
That's closing
For every heartbreak there's hope for something new
From the ashes rise a glimpse of paradise
It still flickered in your eyes
I found myself when I found you

[Chorus]
I found the closest thing to heaven
Yes, in you, I found the deepest love I knew
Ooh-ooh, oh, I believe, yes, it's true
I found myself when I found you
Ooh, yeah

[Bridge]
How life unfolds, no one knows
I thought love was just a tingling of the skin
I felt so alone, all alone
More than you could ever know
You show deeper love, sweeter love, when I found you

[Chorus]
I found the closest thing to Heaven
I found the deepest love I knew
When I found you
I found the closest thing to heaven
Yes, in you, I found the deepest love I knew
Ooh-ooh, oh, I believe, yes, it's true
I found myself when I found you
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Laying here in your arms, and you hold me tight, tight
Trying not to watch the clock tick, ticking as the time goes by
And I know that you best be on your way
But I'm wishing I could make you stay, stay with me for a while

[Pre-Chorus]
Though you're near, still I wanna make it clear
Love, I will always be around

[Chorus]
You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye
I feel it already, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye

[Verse 2]
Kinda hard for me to let you know
Still don't let my feelings show how much I will miss in you
All the little things that make me weak
Your eyes and the way you speak, without you, baby, I'm not me

[Pre-Chorus]
Though you're near, still I wanna make it clear
Love, I will always be around

[Chorus]
You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye
I feel it already, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye

[Break]
You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye
I feel it already, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye

[Chorus]
You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye
I feel it already, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye

[Outro]
You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye

[Verse 2: Britney Spears  with Madonna]
We're almost there

Uh, I see you over there

You got that thing that I can't deny
So move it over here, oh, yeah

You tell me you're in love with me
Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me
It's not that I don't wanna stay
But every time you come too close, I move away

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me, move slow
There's things about me you just have to know

[Chorus]
Sometimes I run
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right
Be with you day and night
Baby, all I need is time

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna be so shy, uh, oh
Every time that I'm alone, I wonder why
Hope that you will wait for me
You'll see that you're the only one for me

'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me, move slow

There's nowhere I'd rather be
If you love me, trust in me
The way that I trust in you
Ah, ooh, yeah

[Chorus]
Sometimes I run (Sometimes)
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you (Ooh, ooh)
But all I really want is to hold you tight (Hold you tight)

Oh, my love
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm sittin' here alone up in my room
And thinkin' 'bout the times that we've been through
Oh, my love
I'm lookin' at a picture in my hand
Trying my best to understand
I really wanna know what we did wrong
With a love that felt so strong

[Pre-Chorus]
If only you were here tonight
I know that we could make it right

[Chorus]
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one within my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy

[Verse 2]
I know I've been a fool since you've been gone
I'd better give it up and carry on
Oh, my love
'Cause livin' in a dream of you and me
Is not the way my life should be
I don't wanna cry a tear for you
So forgive me if I do (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
If only you were here tonight
I know that we could make it right

[Chorus]
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one within my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy

Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Ooh (Na-na-na), yeah, yeah
Ooh (Na-na-na)

[Verse 1]
"Never look back," we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?
Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind
Where do I go?

[Pre-Chorus]
And you didn't hear
All my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you know, still, I miss you somehow?

[Chorus]
From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love
'Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

[Verse 2]
"Baby," I said, "Please stay" (Stay)
"Give our love a chance for one more day, oh"
We could've worked things out (Taking time is what it's all about)
Taking time is what love's all about (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But you put a dart
Through my dreams, through my heart
And I'm back where I started again, yeah
Never thought it would end

[Chorus]
From the bottom of my broken heart (My broken heart)
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love
'Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

[Bridge]
You promised yourself
But to somebody else
And you made it so perfectly clear
Still, I wish you were here now

[Chorus]
From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two (A thing or two) I'd like you to know (You gotta know)
(You were my first love) You were my first love
You were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
(You were my real love) You were my real love
I never knew love 'til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

[Outro]
"Never look back," we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?

[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
You don't have to say what's on your mind
'Cause I know where you've been
Give it up and leave it all behind
And then let me begin

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on over here
Let me show how things should be
I will make it alright
Let me make it clear
You can put your trust in me
Yes, I will be there

[Chorus]
When you need someone
You just turn around
And I will be there
When you're feeling low
Baby, let me know
And I will be there

[Verse 2]
Won't you let me make it up to you?
Now you know where I am
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
Just to love once again

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on over here
Let me show how things should be
I will make it alright
Let me make it clear
You can put your trust in me
Yes, I will be there

[Chorus]
When you need someone
You just turn around
And I will be there
When you're feeling low
Baby, let me know
And I will be there
I will be there

[Bridge]
Just take a stand
I'll be here for you now and forever
Give one more chance
To show you how much I care
I'll be there

[Chorus]
When you need someone
Just turn around
And I will be there
When you're in sorrow
Just let me know and I will be there

[Chorus]
When you need someone
You just turn around
And I will be there (I will be there)
When you're feeling low
Baby, let me know
And I will be there (I will be there)

[Outro]
I'll be there (I will be there)
(I will be there) I will be there

[Intro: Britney Spears & Don Philip]
Time may take us apart, but I will still love you, I promise
Oh, whoa, oh, yeah
And when the stars, stars are falling, I'll keep calling

[Verse 1: Britney Spears, Don Philip & Both]
I promise that you'll be my one my only everything

And even through longest of our nights
And even through the darkest days our
Love will find a way

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Don Philip]
And when the stars are falling, I'll keep calling

You are my summer breeze, my winter sun, my springtime soul, my autumn touch of gold, yeah
You are my sky, my rain, a way which my love flows 'cause you're all
The smile of my heart and the breath of my soul
Even if we find ourselves apart
We will hold out hopes and dreams
Forever in our hearts

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Don Philip]
And when the stars are falling (stars are falling), I'll keep calling (I'll keep calling)
I will still love you
And when your dreams are fading (dreams are fading), I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)

Tell me how you feel
I finally know how to feel, tell me if it's real
And my heart tells me it's real
So real, so real

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Don Philip]
And when the stars are falling (stars are falling), I'll keep calling (I'll keep calling)
I will still love you
And when your dreams are fading, I'll be waiting
I will still love you (I will still love you, baby)

[Verse 3: Britney Spears & Don Philip]
Time will take us apart that's true
But I will always be there for you
You're in my heart and you'll be in my dreams
No matter how many miles between
I promise you that I won't forget
The day we kissed or the day we met
The sky may fall and the stars may too
But I will still, I will still love you

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Don Philip]
And when the stars are falling, I'll keep calling
I will still love you (I'll still be loving you)
And when your dreams are fading, I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)
I will still love you

[Intro]
It's so hot in here

[Verse 1]
Oh, it's so hot, and I need some air
And boy, don't stop 'cause I'm halfway there
It's not complicated, we're just syncopated
We can read each other's minds
One love united
Two bodies synchronizing
Don't even need to touch me
Baby, just

[Chorus]
Breathe on me
Oh baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Oh, this is way beyond the physical (Too way beyond the physical)
Tonight, my senses don't make sense at all
Our imagination, taking us to places
We have never been before (never been before)
Take me in, let it out
Don't even need to touch me
Baby, just

[Chorus]
Breathe on me
Oh baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe on me (breathe on me)
Oh baby just, breathe on me (breathe on me)
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe (oh)

[Bridge]
Monogamy is the way to go (go, go)
Just put your lips together and blow (blow, blow)
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe

[Chorus]
Breathe on me (oh, oh)
Oh baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe
Breathe on me (breathe on me)
Oh baby just, breathe on me (breathe on me)
We don't need to touch, just

[Exhale]

[Intro]
Sometimes I just love to have that out
Just something a girl's gotta do, oh

[Verse 1]
Never thought I'd see you like this
You're looking good when you're half dressed
Just let me give you one last test
Is that a sin? (No)
Am I too hot for you though?
Did you check out my video?
There's some things you don't know
Like this

[Pre Chorus]
I dare you to stand in my way
Just give in when you are ready to play
Uh, like this

[Chorus]
Here comes the showdown
What goes around comes around
And the crowds are waiting, oh
'Cause if we break up, then we can make up
Shake my body all night
Here comes the showdown, oh

[Verse 2]
I don't really wanna be a tease
But would you undo my zipper please?
Uh-uh, please don't talk, listen
I'll let you touch me if you want
I see your body rise, rise
And when you come, don't get too hot
Butterfly

[Pre Chorus]
I dare you to stand in my way
Just give in when you are ready to play
Uh, like this

[Chorus]
Here comes the showdown
What goes around comes around
And the crowds are waiting, oh
'Cause if we break up, then we can make up
Shake my body all night
Here comes the showdown, oh

[Bridge]
Forget the tension when we fight
You make it up, turn down the light
It's just a lover's game we play, yeah
After the screaming's at an end
Why don't we do it all again?
That's when the fun really begins

[Chorus]
Here comes the showdown
What goes around comes around
And the crowds are waiting, oh
'Cause if we break up, then we can make up
Shake my body all night
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Here comes the showdown, oh
Here comes the showdown, oh
What goes around comes around
The crowds are waiting, oh
(Yeah)
Here comes the showdown, oh

[Intro]
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Friends say, I'm away
Because I'm down with you every day
They say, break away
I'm missing out on the fun and games
But you smile and the words they tell me quickly disappear
You speak and there is no other voice that I can hear

[Chorus]
I spend my days (Ooh, ooh)
With you (I spend my days)
I spend my nights (My nights)
Thinkin' about you (Thinkin' about you, babe)
I spend my days (All day, all night)
With you (with you)
I spend my nights (My nights)
Thinkin' about you

[Verse 2]
You stay on my mind, oh
And I think about you all the time (All the time)
Day and night
Feels so right
And for us, there is no end in sight, ooh
Each day that I spend around you
Passes by too fast
Each night that I spend without you
Is longer than the last

[Chorus]
I spend my days (I spend my days)
With you (Thinkin' about you, babe)
I spend my nights (My nights)
Thinkin' about you (All day, all night)
I spend my days (My days)
With you (Thinkin' about you)
I spend my nights (My nights)
Thinkin' about you (Thinkin' about you, babe)

[Outro]
Ooh, you know I can't get enough of you (Can't get enough, yeah)
Uh-uh, you know that 24 hours won't ever, ever do (Yeah, yeah)
I spend my days, with you (With you, with you)
I spend my nights (my nights) thinkin' about you
I spend my days (I spend my days) with you (with you, baby)
I spend my nights (all day, all night) thinkin' about you (All day, all night)
I spend my days (thinkin' about you) with you (Thinkin' about you)
I spend my nights (I spend my days, oh yeah) thinkin' about you
I spend my days (with you) with you (thinkin' about you)
I spend my nights (thinkin' about you, baby)
Thinkin' about you
I spend my days (All day, all night)
With you (All day, all night)

[Intro]
Forever

[Verse 1]
It's been hours, seems like days
Since you went away
And all I do is check the screen
To see if you're okay
You don't answer when I phone
Guess you wanna be left alone
So I'm sending you my heart, my soul
And this is what I'll say

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry, oh, so sorry
Can't you give me one more chance
To make it all up to you?

[Chorus]
Email my heart and say our love will never die
And that (I know) I know you're out there
And I know that you still care (I know you care)
Email me back and say our love will stay alive
Forever, yeah
Email my heart (Whoa)

[Verse 2]
I can see you in my mind (My mind)
Comin' on the line (On the line)
And opening this letter that I've sent a hundred times
Here's a picture of us two (Us two)
I look so good on you (On you)
And can't you please forgive me
For the hurt I put you through?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry, oh, so sorry
Can't you give me one more chance
To make it all up to you?

[Chorus]
Email my heart and say our love will never die
And that (I know) I know you're out there
And I know that you still care (Know that you still care) (I know you care)
Email me back and say our love will stay alive
Forever (Won't you say, won't you say, won't you say)
Email my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry, oh, so sorry
Can't you give me one more chance
To make it all up to—

[Chorus]
(You) Email my heart and say our love will never die
And that (I know) I know you're out there
And I know that you still care (I know that you still care) (I know you care)
Email me back and say our love will stay alive
Forever (Won't you say, won't you say, won't you say)
Forever
Forever (Won't you say, won't you say, won't you say)
Email my heart

[Verse 1]
She's gonna pack her bags, she's gonna find her way
She's gonna get right out of this
She don't want New York, she don't want L.A
She's gonna find her special kiss
She don't want no sleep, she don't want no high
Oh, like peaches and cream
She's gonna wish on stars and touch the sky
Ah, you know what I mean?

[Pre Chorus]
She wants the good life, no need to rewind
She needs to really, really find what she wants
She lands on both feet, won't take a back seat
There's a brave new girl, and she's coming out tonight

[Chorus]
She's gonna step outside, uncover her eyes
Who knew she could feel so alive?
Her M.O.'s changed
She don't wanna behave
Ain't it good to be a brave girl tonight?

[Post-Chorus]
Tonight, it's alright
A brave girl tonight

[Verse 2]
So, she met this man, he was kind of rough
He said, "Girl, what you looking for?"
She said, "I don't know, I go with the flow"
He said, "Let's get on the floor"
He said, "You look real cute with your low ride jeans and your pink little baby tee"
"Let's get a room, girl, come and ride with me"

[Pre Chorus]
She wants the good life, no need to rewind
She needs to really, really find what she wants
She lands on both feet, won't take a back seat
There's a brave new girl, and she's coming out tonight

[Chorus]
She's gonna step outside, uncover her eyes
Who knew she could feel so alive?
Her M.O.'s changed
She don't wanna behave
Ain't it good to be a brave girl tonight?

[Post-Chorus]
Tonight, it's alright
A brave girl tonight
Tonight, it's alright
A brave girl tonight

[Bridge]
I just keep on running
I just keep on running
Who knew she could feel so alive?
(Shining star)

[Chorus]
She's gonna step outside, uncover her eyes
Who knew she could feel so alive?
Her M.O.'s changed
She don't wanna behave
Ain't it good to be a brave girl tonight?

[Outro]
Tonight, it's alright
A brave girl tonight
Tonight, it's alright
A brave girl tonight
A brave girl tonight
A brave girl tonight

[Verse 1]
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-di-da-di-di
La-di-da-di-da
Wait 'til you have reached the age, blah-blah
History has turned the page, blah-blah
But we still wanna hear a brand new thing, uh-huh
We still need a song to sing, uh-huh

[Chorus]
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on

[Verse 2]
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-di-da-di-di
La-di-da-di-da
Love is the first and last thing on our minds
From tomorrow 'til the end of time

[Chorus]
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes—
And the beat goes—
And the beat goes on

[Verse 3]
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-di-da-di-di
La-di-da-di-da
We still move to a rhythm just like this
We still dream of sharing our first kiss

[Chorus]
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on

[Verse 4]
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-di-da-di-di
La-di-da-di-da
The world keeps turning faster everyday (Everyday)
We still wanna dance the night away

[Chorus]
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on

[Intro]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
They say in this world, nothing lasts forever
But I don’t believe that’s true
'Cause the way that I feel when we are together
I know that’s the way, I always feel for you

[Chorus]
From now until forever
That’s how long I’ll be true
I'll make you this vow
And promise you now until forever
I’ll never stop loving you

[Verse 2]
Then will come a day when the world stops turning
And stars will fall from the sky but this feeling will last
When the suns start burning
But all I want to do is love you until the end of time

[Chorus]
From now until forever
That’s how long I’ll be true
I'll make you this vow
And promise you now until forever
(I’ll never stop, never stop) I’ll never stop loving you

[Bridge]
It’s gonna take more than a lifetime
To give you all the love (All the love)
I feel for you tonight

[Chorus]
From now until forever
That’s how long I’ll be true
I'll make you this vow
And promise you now until forever
(I’ll never stop, never stop) I’ll never stop loving you
From now until forever
That’s how long I’ll be true
I'll make you this vow
And promise you now until forever
I’ll never stop loving you until forever
I’ll never stop loving you

[Intro: Britney Spears]
Early mornin'
Alright, I was a little late last night
Got a little messy
Early mornin'
Can't be like that anymore, no

[Chorus: Penelope Magnet & Britney Spears]
I was shaking my ass in the streets 'til mornin'
Just walked in and it's early mornin' (Ah)
Bump, bump 'til the break of dawn and
It don't stop 'til the early mornin'
Passed out on the couch, I'm yawning
Just walked in and it's early mornin' (Passed out again)
Bump, bump 'til the break of dawn and
It don't stop 'til the early mornin'

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
Met a dark dude, kinda dark hair
When he walked up, Tony grabbed him
But I liked him, told him, "Come here"
Kinda cool
Baby, we can make plans
Where you live? Do your mama live there?
We can hook up at the hotel
He's down so I told him, "Let's go"
What happened next, guess what?
You don't wanna know

[Chorus: Penelope Magnet & Britney Spears]
I was shaking my ass in the streets 'til mornin' (Yeah)
Just walked in and it's early mornin' (Ah)
Bump, bump 'til the break of dawn and

Passed out on the couch, I'm yawning
Just walked in and it's early mornin'
Bump, bump 'til the break of dawn and
It don't stop 'til the early mornin'

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
I went out with my girl Jen
And we called up Gabe and his friends
He was talking 'bout hitting up show
So I said, "What the hell, let's go"
Got up, got on the dance floor
Hooked up with a guy named Joe
When the music was fast and slow
What happened next, guess what?
You don't wanna know

[Chorus: Penelope Magnet & Britney Spears]
I was shaking my ass in the streets 'til mornin' (Yeah)
Just walked in and it's early mornin'
Bump, bump 'til the break of dawn and
It don't stop 'til the early mornin'
Passed out on the couch, I'm yawning
Just walked in and it's early mornin'
Bump, bump 'til the break of dawn and
It don't stop 'til the early mornin'

[Bridge: Kyron Leslie & Britney Spears]
Call all your boys (Call all your boys)
Call all your girls (Call all your girls)

Shoowap, shoowap
Yes (Can't keep, can't keep doing this) early mornin'
Shoowap, shoowap
Yes (Can't keep, can't keep doing this) early mornin'

I wanna get with you
You should try her
So come over here and let's go some-oh-whoa-oh

[Chorus: Penelope Magnet & Britney Spears]
I was shaking my ass in the streets 'til mornin'

Early mornin'

[Chorus]
I never promised you a happy ending
You never said you wouldn't make me cry
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
Autumn goodbye

[Verse 1]
Thinking of you and the love of our lives
In the sweet summertime
So sad, but true (So true, so true)
We must leave it behind
In our hearts, in our minds

[Pre-Chorus]
From April through September
Bittersweet was the love that we share
Don't forget; I remember

[Chorus]
I never promised you a happy ending (You never said)
You never said you wouldn't make me cry (But summer love)
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
I never promised you a happy ending (You never said)
You never said you wouldn't make me cry (But summer love)
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye

[Verse 2]
Memories can fade (they can fade)
But my heart has a place for the smile on your face (on your face)
And maybe someday we can be more than friends
Love will find us again
Red leaves and blue tomorrows
Time will give back the love that we shared
On the time that we borrowed

[Chorus]
I never promised you a happy ending (You never said)
You never said you wouldn't make me cry (But summer love)
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
I never promised you a happy ending (You never said)
You never said you wouldn't make me cry (But summer love)
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
From April through September
Bittersweet was the love that we share
Don't forget; I remember, baby

[Chorus]
I never promised you a happy ending (You never said)
You never said you wouldn't make me cry (But summer love)
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
Autumn goodbye
I never promised you a happy ending (You never said)
You never said you wouldn't make me cry (But summer love)
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
Autumn goodbye

[Bridge]
We'll leave behind the summertime
Our hearts, our minds
They will remind
We won't forget
The day we met
The day we cried
Autumn goodbye

[Chorus]
I never promised you a happy ending (You never said)
You never said you wouldn't make me cry (But summer love)
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
Autumn goodbye
I never promised you a happy ending (You never said)
You never said you wouldn't make me cry (But summer love)
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
Autumn goodbye

[Intro]
Oh, oh, I want you for the rest of my life, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Walking through time looking for an answer
How can it be this way?
What have I done? I just can't help but wonder
How everything could change

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you've turned my world around
Since you came along, no
After this love was found
It seems like we can't go wrong

[Chorus]
Deep in my heart, I know there's only you
And right from the start, I always knew
I'll never let go 'cause I love you so
Oh, oh, I want you for the rest of my life, oh, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Some people search what seems to be a lifetime
To find a love like this, oh yeah
And here we are, with everything we wished for
I've never felt such bliss, oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you've turned my world around
Since you came along
After this love was found
It seems like we can't go wrong

And right from the start, I always knew
I'll never let go 'cause I love you so
Oh, oh, I want you for the rest of my life, oh yeah, oh, oh

There comes a chance in everyone’s life
And I believe it won't happen twice
Now since I've felt the glory of love
I wanna spend forever (And ever with you)

[Chorus]
Deep in my heart, I know there's only you (Only you)
And right from the start, I always knew
I'll never let go 'cause I love you so (I love you so)
Oh, oh, I want you for the rest of my life, oh
Deep in my heart, I know there's only you (Only you, only you)
And right from the start, I always knew

Oh, oh, I want you

Deep in my heart
(Deep in my heart)
Oh oh, no
Oh, oh yeah

I want you for the rest of my life

[Chorus]
Outrageous when I move my body
Outrageous when I'm at a party
Outrageous in my sexy jeans
Outrageous when I'm on the scene
Outrageous, my sex drive
Outrageous, my shopping spree
Outrageous, we on a world tour
Outrageous, that's B-girl
Outrageous

[Verse 1]
Sexy as I wanna be
Got these fellas chasing me
It's 'bout time I hit the streets
All my girls still feeling me
B-girl ain't lost the beat
Jumped over drama and I landed on my feet
Got to keep going, no stopping me
And if you don't like it, then (La, la-la-la, la-la-la)

[Pre-Chorus]
Media, over here
Coming through like a world premiere
Trench coat and my underwear
Let's go with this freak show

[Chorus]
It's outrageous when I move my body
Outrageous when I'm at a party
Outrageous in my sexy jeans
Outrageous when I'm on the scene
Outrageous, my sex drive
Outrageous, my shopping spree
Outrageous, we on a world tour
Outrageous, that's B-girl
Outrageous

[Verse 2]
I'm about to bring the heat
Locking down the industry
Aren't I suburb glamorous?
Red carpet and cameras
Take trips around the globe
Tints on my Jeeps so nobody knows
So hot, got you coming out your clothes
I'm about to give you the (La, la-la-la, la-la-la)

[Pre-Chorus]
Media, over here
Coming through like a world premiere
Trench coat and my underwear
Let's go with this freak show

[Chorus]
It's outrageous when I move my body
Outrageous when I'm at a party
Outrageous in my sexy jeans
Outrageous when I'm on the scene
Outrageous, my sex drive
Outrageous, my shopping spree
Outrageous, we on a world tour
Outrageous, that's B-girl
Outrageous

[Bridge]
I just wanna be happy
In a place where love is free
Can you take me there?
Somebody, ooh
And when you mention my name
Make sure you know the truth, yeah
Until I vow to keep it forever

[Chorus]
Outrageous when I move my body
Outrageous when I'm at a party
Outrageous in my sexy jeans
Outrageous when I'm on the scene
Outrageous, my sex drive
Outrageous, my shopping spree
Outrageous, we on a world tour
Outrageous, that's B-girl
Outrageous when I move my body
Outrageous when I'm at a party
Outrageous in my sexy jeans
Outrageous when I'm on the scene
Outrageous, my sex drive
Outrageous, my shopping spree
Outrageous, we on a world tour
Outrageous, that's B-girl

[Verse 1]
Superstar, where you from? How's it goin'?
I know you got a clue what you're doin'
You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are, what you are, baby
Look at you, gettin' more than just a re-up
Baby, you got all the puppets with their strings up
Fakin' like a good one, but I call 'em like I see 'em
I know what you are, what you are, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You-you-you are, you-you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (Womanizer)

[Chorus]
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
(You) You got me goin', (You) you're oh-so charmin'
(You) But I can't do it, (You) you womanizer
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
(You) You say I'm crazy, (You) I got you crazy
(You) You're nothing but a (You) womanizer

[Verse 2]
Daddy-o, you got the swagger of a champion
Too bad for you, you just can't find the right companion
I guess when you have one too many
Makes it hard, it could be easy
Who you are, that's just who you are, baby
Lollipop, must mistake me, you're the sucker
To think that I would be a victim, not another
Say it, play it how you wanna, but no way
I'm never gonna fall for you, never you, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You-you-you are, you-you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (Womanizer)

[Chorus]
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
(You) You got me goin', (You) you're oh-so charmin'
(You) But I can't do it, (You) you womanizer
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
(You) You say I'm crazy, (You) I got you crazy
(You) You're nothing but a (You) womanizer

[Bridge]
Maybe if we both lived in a different world
(Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer)
It would be all good, and maybe I could be your girl
But I can't 'cause we don't, you

[Pre-Chorus]
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You-you-you are, you-you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (Womanizer)

[Chorus]
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
(You) You got me goin', (You) you're oh-so charmin'
(You) But I can't do it, (You) you womanizer
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
(You) You say I'm crazy, (You) I got you crazy
(You) You're nothing but a (You) womanizer

[Outro]
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby

[Verse 1]
Nothing seems to be the way
That it used to
Everything seems shallow
God give me truth

[Pre-Chorus]
In me
And tell me somebody's watching
Over me
And that is all I'm praying's that

[Chorus]
Someday I will understand
In God's whole plan
And what he's done to me
Oh, but maybe
Someday I will breathe
And I'll finally see
I'll see it all in my baby

[Verse 2]
Don't you run too fast my dear
Why don't you stop?
Just stop and listen to your tears
They're all you've got

[Pre-Chorus]
It's in you
You see, somebody's watching
Over you
And that is all I'm praying's that

[Chorus]
Someday you will understand
In God's whole plan
And what he does to you
Oh, but maybe
Someday you will breathe
And you'll finally see
You'll see it all in your baby
You'll see it all in your baby

[Bridge]
No moment
Will be more true
Than the moment
I look at you

[Pre-Chorus]
It's in you
You see somebody's watching
Over you
And that is all I'm praying's that

[Chorus]
Someday you will understand
In God's whole plan
And what he does to you
Oh, but maybe
Someday you will breathe
And you'll finally see
You'll see it all in your baby
You'll see it all in your baby
You'll see it all in your baby
You'll see it all in your baby

[Intro]
For whatever reason
I feel like I've been wanting you all my life
You don't understand
I'm so glad we're at the same place at the same time
It's over now

[Verse 1]
I spotted you dancing, you made all the girls stare
Those lips and your brown eyes (ooh), and the sexy hair
I shake, shake my thing, and make the world want you
Tell your boys you'll be back, I wanna see what you can do

[Pre-Chorus]
What would it take for you to just leave with me?
Not tryna sound conceited, but me and you were meant to be
You're a sexy guy, I'm a nice girl (Don't you know?)
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world

[Chorus]
Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one (You know I need you)
Boys, to love her and to hold (I just want you to touch me)
Boys, and when a girl is with one
Boys, then she's in control

[Verse 2]
Took the boy off the dance floor, screaming in his ear
Must've said something 'bout me 'cause he's looking over here (What you say?)
You looking at me with that sexy attitude
But the way your boy's moving it, it puts me in the mood (Ow!)

[Pre Chorus]
What would it take for you to just leave with me?
Not tryna sound conceited, but me and you were meant to be
(Don't you know?)
You're a sexy guy (ooh), I'm a nice girl (Don't you know?)
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world

[Chorus]
Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one (I get nasty)
Boys, to love her and to hold (I get nasty)
Boys, and when a girl is with one (I get nasty)
Boys, then she's in control
(You like that? Here we go)

[Bridge 1]
Tonight, let's fly, boy, have no fear (Have no fear)
There's no time to lose (Baby, what are you waiting for?)
And next week, you may not see me here (Uh-uh)
So, boy, just make your move (Let me see what you can do)

[Chorus]
Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one
Boys, to love her and to hold (The way you move)
Boys, and when a girl is with one (It's gon' turn me on)
Boys, then she's in control

[Bridge 2]
Come with me, let's fly into the night
Oh, boy, tonight is ours (It's just you and me, baby)
Keep loving me, make sure you hold me tight
Let's head for the stars (Get nasty)
Ow!

[Chorus]
Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one
Boys, to love her and to hold (Get nasty)
Boys, and when a girl is with one (Get nasty)
Boys, then she's in control

[Outro]
Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em

[Verse 1]
I'm not ashamed of the things that I dream
I find myself flirting with the verge of obscene
Into the unknown, I will be bold
I'm going to places I can be out of control

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't want to explain tonight
All the things I've tried to hide
I shut myself out from the world so I
Can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly
I love myself, it's not a sin
I can't control what's happening

[Chorus]
'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand

[Verse 2]
The small of my back, the arch of my feet
Lately I've been noticing the beautiful me
I'm all in my skin and I'm not gonna wait
I'm into myself in the most precious way

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't want to explain tonight
All the things I've tried to hide (To hide)
I shut myself out from the world so I
Can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly

[Chorus]
'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand

[Bridge]
There's a world undefined
In my body and mind
I won't be left behind
I'm already here

[Chorus]
'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand
'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand

[Outro]
Hey, hey, hey, oh, oh (oh, oh)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, oh (oh, oh)
Ey, he-he-hey

But she don't wanna hook up, told him: "Just go"
And then she looked and said she wanna hook up
I really wanna hook up, told him: "Let's go"

[Verse 1]

And the way that you move on the floor

Baby, I can't believe everything that I feel when I dance with you

Move the party, gotta rock the party until they're over you

[Chorus]

Tonight, I'm in the mood
Please take me by your hand
I wanna get in your groove
So, baby, take me there

[Post-Bridge]
Yo, everybody get up now!

[Intro]

[Ed Axley] “I gotta ask this question or I wouldn’t be doing my job...
Would you care to comment on the rumor that you arranged for an automobile to be purchased for (Action Bronson)?"

[Pete Bell] “You know- You know, Ed, you just gotta get your mind out of the gutter
You know, you- you just gotta start thinking straight
I mean, it’s right there in front of you
For Christ’s sake it wasn’t an automobile, I mean, it was a fully loaded Lexus!”

[Verse 1]
Fifty large
Sitting sipping vichyssoise
Silk robes
Pepper on the pasta
Cheeses from Lazio
Pussy mi carpaccio
Lightly dressed
Hairy like a Viking’s chest
Bobby Bacala
Hopping out the Saab
Chris Hansen
Dancin’ in a Swiss mansion
Shorty gorgeous
Daddy keep the wrist handsome
Old Impalas
Keep them jumping like they Steve Francis
Need a Carhartts
Like Dykstra with the car wash
Young Tarbash
Higher than a Star Fox
Monday morning
Caught her back end with the arm slot
Twenty years
Probably catch me with the pony tail
Borsch polish
Sipping out the holy grail
Tear-away pants
Prince Rogers Nelson
We father figures
Famous like DiMaggio
You can tell a tranny by the neck
Catch me in Solana with the bow and arrow
Roasting marrow
Lacoste Sailboat
Tying hookers to the railroad
Doctor Zizmor
On the N train, Astoria-bound
Celino and Barnes
Trying to get the paper right

[Verse 2]
Trying to get the paper right
Guy Fieri shirt
Long pinky nail
Nose numb
Earing with the feather
Every hooker’s name is Heather
The Marlboro hat
The Newport windbreakers
Ne-Yo mixtape cover
Straight from the Aqueduct
Black Acura
Imported straight from Africa
White tigers
Thousand-dollar spatula
Panzanella
Salad with the bread
Big retard sleep with
Towels on the bed
Blue chips with the championship
Plus the Lexus
Weed smell like disinfectant
Fucking bitches pregnant
Stroller from Stockholm
Nanny from Haiti
Boyz II Men posters
Gladys Knight fried chicken

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain and the ones that observe
Well, baby, I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl
Don't like the backseat, gotta be first (Oh, oh)
I'm like the ringleader, I call the shots (Call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot

[Pre-Chorus]
When I put on a show
I feel the adrenaline movin' through my veins
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

[Chorus]
All eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gon' trip
Just like a circus
Don't stand there watchin' me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus

[Verse 2]
There's only two types of guys out there
Ones that can hang with me and ones that are scared
So, baby, I hope that you came prepared
I run a tight ship, so beware
I'm like the ringleader, I call the shots (I call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot

[Pre-Chorus]
When I put on a show
I feel the adrenaline movin' through my veins
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

[Chorus]
All eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gon' trip
Just like a circus
Don't stand there watchin' me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus

[Breakdown]
Let's go
Let me see what you can do
I'm runnin' this (Like-like-like-like a circus)
Yeah, like a what? (Like-like-like-like a circus)

[Chorus]
All eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gon' trip
Just like a circus
Don't stand there watchin' me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus
All eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gon' trip
Just like a circus
Don't stand there watchin' me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus

[Verse 1]
Your body's warm, but you are not
You give a little, not a lot
It could be love until we kiss
You're all I want, but not like this
I'm watching you disappear
But you, you were never here

[Chorus]
It's only your shadow
Never yourself
It's only your shadow
Nobody else
It's only your shadow
Filling the room
Arriving too late
And leaving too soon
And leaving too soon

[Verse 2]
Your body gives, but then holds back
The sun is bright, the sky is black
Can only be another sign
I cannot keep what isn't mine
Your laughter, it lingers on
But you, you were almost gone

[Chorus]
It's only your shadow
Never yourself
It's only your shadow
Nobody else
It's only your shadow
Filling the room
Arriving too late
And leaving too soon
And leaving too soon

[Bridge]
How can I tell if you mean what you say?
You say it so loud, but you sound far away
Maybe I had just a glimpse of your soul
Or was that your shadow I saw on the wall?
I'm watching you disappear
But you, you were never here

[Chorus]
It’s only your shadow
Never yourself
It’s only your shadow
Nobody else
It’s only your shadow
Filling the room
Arriving too late
No, no, no
It’s only your shadow
It’s only your shadow
Nobody else
It’s only your shadow
Arriving too late
And leaving too soon
Ooh, oh
It’s only your shadow

[Verse 1]
There's too much of this noise
Boy, let's get a seat
So you can talk sweet to me
I see these other boys
But you got me on the dance floor
Now you're like, buyin' me drinks
You’s a sexy guy, and I wonder why
We could have some fun, so don’t be shy
Baby, just enjoy what’s on your mind
Party and have a good time

[Pre-Chorus]
It's gettin' hectic in here
It's gettin' chaotic
I'm rockin', I'm rollin'
No stoppin', we goin' until it's over
Do you like the way I rock it?
Boy, I think it's so chaotic

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm wild, I'm on fire (Burnin' up the dance floor)
Turn it up higher, wild like a tiger (Tell me, do you want more?)
Everybody blink your lights
Crowded from the left to right
Oh, I'm on fire
Oh, I'm on fire (Burning up the dance floor)
Do you like the way I rock it?
Boy, it's chaotic

[Verse 2]
There's too much of the sound
I'm on the prowl
So please don't turn me down
I'm having so much fun and we ain’t done
I'm gonna tell you now, the DJ is my friend
So let’s begin, I'ma do my dance until the end
Baby, just get down, let's paint the town
Everybody here's gettin' wild

[Pre-Chorus]
It's gettin' hectic in here
It's gettin' chaotic
I'm rockin', I'm rollin'
No stoppin', we goin' until it's over
Do you like the way I rock it?
Boy, I think it's so chaotic

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm wild, I'm on fire (Burning up the dance floor)
Turn it up higher, wild like a tiger (Tell me, do you want more?)
Everybody blink your lights
Crowded from the left to right
Oh, I'm on fire
Oh, I'm on fire (Burning up the dance floor)
Do you like the way I rock it?
Boy, it's chaotic
Oh, I'm wild, I'm on fire (Burning up the dance floor)
Turn it up higher, wild like a tiger (Tell me, do you want more?)
Everybody blink your lights
Crowded from the left to right
Oh, I'm on fire
Oh, I'm on fire (Burning up the dance floor)
Do you like the way I rock it?
Boy, it's chaotic

[Bridge]
Look at what you do to me
Melt it down for all to see
I can't help it, no, I can't
Burn it down so we can dance
Look at what you made me do
I can't get enough of you
Turn me in and turn me out
Just don't put the fire out

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm wild, I'm on fire (Burning up the dance floor)
Turn it up higher, wild like a tiger (Tell me, do you want more?)
Everybody blink your lights
Crowded from the left to right
Oh, I'm on fire
Oh, I'm on fire (Burning up the dance floor)
Do you like the way I rock it?
Boy, it's chaotic
Oh, I'm wild, I'm on fire (Burning up the dance floor)
Turn it up higher, wild like a tiger (Tell me, do you want more?)
Everybody blink your lights
Crowded from the left to right
Oh, I'm on fire
Oh, I'm on fire (Burning up the dance floor)
Do you like the way I rock it?
Boy, it's chaotic

[Outro]
Aah, la la la
Ah, la la la la
Aah, la la la
Aah, la la la

[Intro]
This is a story about Mona Lisa
The Mona Lisa

[Verse 1]
Ladies and gentlemen, I've got a little story to tell
About Mona Lisa, and how she suddenly fell
Now, see, everyone knew her, they knew her, oh, so well
Now I'm taking over to release her from her spell

[Chorus]
She's the original (Yeah, yeah)
She's unforgettable (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
She wants you to know (Yeah)
She's been cloned
It's kind of incredible (Yeah, yeah)
She's so unpredictable (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
She wants you to know (Yeah)
She's been cloned, she's been cloned, she's been cloned

[Verse 2]
She was taken under, drowning in her sea
Running like an angel, she was crying and could not see (Oh, no)
Now, see, everyone's watching as she starts to fall
They want her to break down
There will be a legend of her fall

[Chorus]
She's the original (Yeah, yeah)
She's unforgettable (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
She wants you to know (Yeah)
She's been cloned
It's kind of incredible (Yeah, yeah)
She's so unpredictable (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
She wants you to know (Yeah)
She's been cloned, she's been cloned, she's been cloned

[Bridge]
Now, ladies, does that make you cry?
Mona Lisa's got to fly
Nobody really dies
Everyone, may we have a moment of silence?
Right here
God

[Chorus]
She's the original (Yeah, yeah)
She's unforgettable (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
She wants you to know (Yeah)
She's been cloned
It's kind of incredible (Yeah, yeah)

[Intro]
Do you like this?
This place that I’m bringing you to?
Because I do
Oh, my God

[Verse 1]
I know this place is still a secret
And I don’t think you’ve ever been
It’s kind of hard to find the entrance
You need some juice
But you’ll love it once you get in
This special place is in the basement
You have to work your way around
The place is hot and then it’s pumping
So are you ready to go down?

[Chorus]
So it’s over to you now
So it’s over to you now, now (Yeah)
It was over to you now
Can’t you see what I’m thinking-ing? (Yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
If you behave you might be chosen
Just read the flyer
And it tells you how to get there
And when you come
You might be stunned there
So, baby, what you waiting for?

[Chorus]
So it’s over to you now
So it’s over to you now, now, yeah
It was over to you now
Can’t you see what I’m thinking-ing? (Yeah)
So it’s over to you now
So it’s over to you now, now, yeah
It was over to you now
Can’t you see what I’m thinking-ing? (Yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Interlude]
Do you like this?
This place that I’m bringing you to?
Do you feel that? Huh?
Do you like that?
I thought you would
'Cause I do
Oh, my God

[Chorus]
So it’s over to you now
So it’s over to you now, now (Yeah)
It was over to you now
Can’t you see what I’m thinking-ing? (Yeah)
So it’s over to you now
So it’s over to you now, now (Yeah)
And it’s over to you now
Can’t you see what I’m thinking-ing? (Yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Oh, my God

[Verse 1]
Notice me, take my hand
Why are we strangers when our love is strong?
Why carry on without me?

[Chorus]
Every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you, baby

[Verse 2]
I make believe that you are here
It's the only way I see clear
What have I done?
You seem to move on easy

[Chorus]
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you, baby

[Bridge]
I may have made it rain
Please, forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry
At night, I pray
That soon your face will fade away

[Chorus]
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you, baby

[Intro]
Yeah, I've been waitin' for you
So patiently
And now you're here
You're my answer
Thank you
Yeah
I think you're my answer
Uh, here I go
Let's go

[Chorus]
You're the answer
All this time, I've tried to find you
I've been yearning (I've been yearning inside)
You're the answer to the question that's been burning (I've been burning inside)
When they ask me who I love
You're the answer (You're my answer)
You're my answer

[Verse 1]
Patiently, I've waited for this day to finally come
Knowing someday somehow I would find that special one
Someone perfect, someone true
Someone that, I knew, was you
(I knew it was you)
Talk to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Who can hold me tight, keep me warm, through the night?
Who can wipe my tears, when it's wrong, make it right?
Who can give me love, 'til I'm satisfied?
Who's the one I need in my life?
Let's go

[Chorus]
You're the answer
All this time, I've tried to find you
I've been yearning (I've been yearning)
You're the answer to the question that's been burning (I've been burning inside)
When they ask me who I love
You're the answer (You're the answer, baby)
You're my answer

[Verse 2]
I can hardly speak because I'm underneath your spell
Saving every moment that I have you to myself
Putting my love to the test
Because baby, this is destiny (Yeah, this is destiny)
Talk to 'em

[Pre-Chorus]
Who can hold me tight, keep me warm, through the night?
Who can wipe my tears, when it's wrong, make it right?
Who can give me love, 'til I'm satisfied?
You're the one I need in my life
Let's go

[Chorus]
You're the answer
All this time, I've tried to find you
I've been yearning (yeah, I've been yearning)
You're the answer to the question that's been burning (I've been burning inside)
When they ask me who I love (when they ask me)
You're the answer (You're my answer)
You're my answer (you're my answer)
You're the answer
All this time, I've tried to find you
I've been yearning (I've been yearning for you)
You're the answer to the question that's been burning (burning, burning)
When they ask me who I love
You're the answer (You're my answer)
You're my answer
Talk to me

[Bridge]
Tell me
Who can hold me tight, keep me warm, through the night? (who can hold me?)
Who can wipe my tears, when it's wrong, make it right? (wipe my tears away) (it's you)
Who can give me love, 'til I'm satisfied? (who can give me love?)
Who's the one I need in my life?
(You're my answer)
Let's go

[Chorus]
You're the answer (You're the answer)
All this time, I've tried to find you
I've been yearning (I've been yearning)
You're the answer to the question that's been burning (that's been burning)
When they ask me who I love
You're the answer (You're the answer baby)
You're my answer
You're the answer (You're my answer)
You're my answer (You're my answer)

[Outro]
Yeah, you're my answer

[Verse 1]
Said you're gonna be here in a minute
Sitting in the mirror getting pretty
Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up
Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up
I can hear you knocking at the front door
And I know exactly what you came for
Try to say goodbye, but it's hot and heavy
Try to say goodbye, but it's hot and heavy

[Pre-Chorus]
You touch me, and it's breaking me down
And me down, and me down, and me down
I'm telling you, let's just give it up and get down
And get down, and get down
So, c'mon

[Chorus]
Won't you give me something to remember?
Baby, shut your mouth, and turn me inside out
Even though we couldn't last forever, baby
You know what I want right now
Hit me one more time, it's so amazing
How you shook my world and flipped it upside down
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy
'Cause you know me inside out, inside out

[Verse 2]
I know that we probably shouldn't do this
Wake up in the morning, feeling stupid
Said that we were done, but you're all up on me
Said that we were done, but you're all up on me
Tell me how we got in this position
Guess I gotta get you out my system
Try to let you go, but it's not that easy
Try to let you go, but it's not that easy

[Pre-Chorus]
You touch me, and it's breaking me down
And me down, and me down, and me down
I'm telling you, let's just give it up and get down
And get down, and get down
So, c'mon

[Chorus]
Won't you give me something to remember?
Baby, shut your mouth, and turn me inside out
Even though we couldn't last forever, baby
You know what I want right now
Hit me one more time, it's so amazing
How you shook my world and flipped it upside down
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy
'Cause you know me inside out

[Breakdown]
Out, out, out, out, out
Inside out, out, out, out, out, out
Inside out
So, c'mon

[Chorus]
Won't you give me something to remember?
Baby, shut your mouth, and turn me inside out
Even though we couldn't last forever, baby
You know what I want right now
Hit me one more time, it's so amazing
How you shook my world and flipped it upside down
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy
'Cause you know me inside out
Out, out, out, out, out, out

[Verse 1]
Baby, I'm lying all alone
The pillow is all I have to hold
Can't feel you, God, it isn't fair
Without you, I still wanna to take you there

[Pre Chorus]
Don't hang up
It's just gettin' serious, damn
You're making me delirious
Don't hang up
Until I'm finished with you
I'm not alone

[Chorus]
(Don't hang up)
I am not alone, I can still feel you
Even when i'm lonely
And now I'm coming too
(Don't hang up)
I am not alone, I can still feel you
Even when I'm lonely, and now I'm coming too

[Verse 2]
Tell me (tell me)
Tell me what you see
Feel me (can you feel me?)
Feel me on my knee
Slowly, we begin to breathe
Hold on, hold on to your leash

[Pre Chorus]
Don't hang up
It's just gettin' serious, damn
You're making me delirious
Don't hang up
Until I'm finished with you
I'm not alone

[Chorus]
(Don't hang up)
I am not alone, I can still feel you
Even when I'm lonely
And now I'm coming too (Don't hang up)
I am not alone, I can still feel you
Even when I'm lonely, and now I'm coming too

[Bridge]
You're far way, we'll find a way
Ooh baby, now, let's make it right
Close your eyes (damn)

[Pre Chorus]
Don't hang up
It's just gettin' serious (damn)
You're making me delirious
Don't hang up
Until I'm finished with you

[Chorus]
I'm not alone (Don't hang up)
I am not alone, I can still feel you
Even when I'm lonely
And now i'm coming too (Don't hang up)
I am not alone, I can still feel you
Even when I'm lonely, and now I'm coming too

[Outro]
Don't hang up
I am not alone, I can still feel you
Do you feel me too?
Even when I'm lonely
Close your eyes
And now I'm coming too
I am not alone, I can still feel you
Even when I'm lonely, and now I'm coming too

[Verse 1]
Here's a little story that I made up
So let's make believe
Four years ago I had a party
That was too much fun for me
Boy, there's a sexy guy
He said he'd give me everything I need
Sometimes I let temptation go too far and get the best of me

[Pre-Chorus]
All I gotta say is
I just want to have some fun
And I'll do it until I'm done
I'm telling you

[Chorus]
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun, yeah
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I've just begun, don't wanna settle down

[Verse 2]
The conversation wasn't going nowhere till I turned my hair
He started touching me and kissing me like he didn't care
I thought at first I should go home, but then fell asleep in the chair

[Pre-Chorus]
All I gotta say is
I just want to have some fun
And I'll do it until I'm done
I'm telling you

[Chorus]
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun, yeah
Inside me there's something I found
I want to shop around
I've just begun, don't wanna settle down
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun, yeah
Inside me there's something I found
I want to shop around
I've just begun, don't wanna settle down

[Bridge]
I just wanna have a good time
I just wanna be myself
And don't let nobody tell you it's any differently
I wanna enjoy the sunshine
And do the things that I need
To see what feels good to me
I'm just so crazy

[Chorus]
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun, yeah
Inside me there's something I found
I want to shop around
I've just begun, don't wanna settle down

[Outro]
I've just begun (Oh)
I've just begun having my fun, yeah
I've just begun (Oh)
I've just begun having my fun, yeah

[Verse 1]
Burn it all down
Wanna buy another round
Gonna light up in the sound of the speaker
Show your knee socks
Drink tequila on the rocks
'Til you make your body pops to the speaker
Burn it all down
Wanna buy another round
Gonna light up in the sound of the speaker
Show your knee socks
Drink tequila on the rocks
'Til you make your body pops to the speaker

[Chorus]
(I wanna go) Downtown where my posse's at
(Because I got) Nine lives like a kitty cat
Uh, you wanna roll, that's how I roll
(I wanna go) Bling-bling when I hear that bass
(I'm gonna do) My thing if you wanna taste
Uh, you better know, uh, that's how I roll

[Post-Chorus]
Bum-bum-bum-ba-da-dee-dum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum-ba-da-dee-dum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum-ba-da-dee-dum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum-ba-da-dee-dum-bum-bum

[Verse 2]
Feel the earth quake
Gonna make your body shake
'Til the circuits starts to break in the speaker
Can we get fly?
Helicopter in the sky
'Cause we turn it up high in the speaker

[Pre-Chorus]
If you know what it takes to be my man
We can go make love together
You can be my thug tonight
We can tear it up tonight

[Chorus]
(I wanna go) Downtown where my posse's at
(Because I got) Nine lives like a kitty cat
Uh, you wanna roll, that's how I roll
(I wanna go) Bling-bling when I hear that bass
(I'm gonna do) My thing if you wanna taste
Uh, you better know, uh, that's how I roll

[Post-Chorus]
Bum-bum-bum-ba-da-dee-dum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum-ba-da-dee-dum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum-ba-da-dee-dum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum-ba-da-dee-dum-bum-bum

[Bridge]
Shimmy, shimmy-ya
Shimmy-yo, shimmy-yay
We could give them what they want
Or we could take it away
Try luck tonight, we could tear it up tonight
If you know what it takes to be my man
We can go make love together
You can be my thug tonight
We can tear it up tonight

[Chorus]
(I wanna go) Downtown where my posse's at
(Because I got) Nine lives like a kitty cat
Uh, you wanna roll, that's how I roll
(I wanna go) Bling-bling when I hear that bass
(I'm gonna do) My thing if you wanna taste
Uh, you better know, uh, that's how I roll

[Post-Chorus]
Bum-bum-bum-ba-da-dee-dum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum-ba-da-dee-dum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum-ba-da-dee-dum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum-ba-da-dee-dum-bum-bum

My body feels like an inferno
Like I'm in a race and I'm jumping a hurdle (It's going so fast)
Come closer, we'll pursue it
If you just let go, we can do it (We can do it)
Baby, I'm yours for the taking
Don't you wanna see my body naked?
I know that you like the way I shake it (uh-huh)
And I hope that you can take it

[Verse 1]
Confidence is a must
Cockiness is a plus
Edginess is a rush
Edges, I like them rough
A man with a Midas touch
Intoxicate me, I'm a lush
Stop, you're making me blush
People are looking at us

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think you know (Know)

[Chorus]
I'm checking you, so hot, so hot
Wonder if you know you're on my radar (On my radar)
On my radar (On my radar)

Interesting sense of style
Ten million dollar smile
Think I can’t handle that animal in the sack
His eyes see right to my soul
I surrender self-control
Catch me looking again
Falling right into my plan

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think you know (Know)

[Chorus]
I'm checking you, so hot, so hot

[Spoken Intro]
It's been a while
I know I shouldn't've kept you waiting
But I'm here now

[Verse 1]
I know it's been a while, but I'm glad you came
And I've been thinking 'bout how you say my name
You got my body spinning, like a hurricane
And it feels like you got me going insane
And I can't get enough
So, let me get it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, looks like we're alone now
You ain't gotta be scared, we're grown now
I'ma hit defrost on ya, let's get it blazin'
We can turn the heat up if ya wanna
Turn the lights down low if ya wanna
Just wanna move ya, but you froze up
That's what I'm saying

[Chorus]
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot

[Interlude]
So, are you warming up yet?

[Verse 2]
You got me hypnotized
I never felt this way
You got my heart beating like an 808
Can you rise to the occasion?
I'm patiently waiting, 'cause it's getting late
And I can't get enough, so let me get it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, looks like we're alone now
You ain't gotta be scared, we're grown now
I'ma hit defrost on ya, let's get it blazin'
We can turn the heat up if ya wanna
Turn the lights down low if ya wanna
Just wanna move ya, but you froze up
That's what I'm saying

[Chorus]
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot

[Spoken Interlude]
I like this part, oh
It feels kinda good
Yeah

[Chorus]
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot

[Outro]
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot

[Verse 1]
Breathe you out, breathe you in
You keep coming back to tell me
You're the one who could have been
And my eyes see it all so clear
It was long ago and far away, but it never disappears

[Pre-Chorus]
Try to put it in the past
Hold on to myself, and don't look back

[Chorus]
I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
And maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now?
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
(From under, from under, from under)

[Verse 2]
So, let me go, just let me fly away
Let me feel the space between us growing deeper
And much darker every day
Watch me now, and I'll be someone new
My heart will be unbroken
It will open up for every one but you

[Pre-Chorus]
Even when I cross the line
It's like a lie I've told a thousand times

[Chorus]
I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
And maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now?
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
(From under, from under, from under, from under)

[Bridge]
And part of me still believes
When you say you're gonna stick around
And part of me still believes
We can find a way to work it out
But I know that we tried everything we could try
So, let's just say goodbye forever

[Chorus]
I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
And maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
And I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now?
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under

[Chorus]
I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
And maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
And I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now?
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
(From under, from under, from under, from under)

[Intro: Danja & Britney Spears]
Ladies and Gentlemen, we interrupt our program of Dance Music to bring you a special bulletin from the intercontinental radio news
Our very own Pop Princess, now Queen of Pop, has a special announcement she would like to make
You're on
I think I'm ready for my close up
Yeah

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
You don't like me, I don't like you, it don't matter
Only difference, you still listen, I don't have to
In one ear and out the other, I don't need you
Your words don't stick, I ain't perfect, but you ain't either
If you're feeling froggy, leap
I ain't even losin' sleep
There's more to me than what you see
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry

[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears]
Mr. Photographer, I think I'm ready for my close-up tonight
Make sure you catch me from my good side, pick one
These other (Ha!) just wanna be me
Is that money in your pocket or you happy to see me?

[Chorus: Britney Spears]
Kill the lights (Take 'em out, turn 'em off, break 'em down)
Kill the lights  (Don't be scared, make a move, see me now?)
Kill the lights (I feel you watching me watching you)
Kill the lights (You can't handle the truth, what happened to 'em?)

[Post-Chorus: Britney Spears]
I kill the lights, the lights, the lights (Pure satisfaction)
I kill the lights, the lights, the lights (Lights, camera, action)
I kill the lights, the lights, the lights (Pure satisfaction)
I kill the lights, the lights, the lights (Lights, camera, action)

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
All the flashin', tryin' to cash in, hurts my eyes
All the poses out of focus I despise
Eff me over, your exposure, not the best
You want me bad, I want you out, release this stress

[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears]
Mr. Photographer, I think I'm ready for my close-up tonight (Yeah, yeah)
Make sure you catch me from my good side, pick one (Yeah)
These other (Ha!) just wanna be me (Yeah)
Is that money in your pocket or you happy to see me?

[Chorus: Britney Spears]
Kill the lights (Take 'em out, turn 'em off, break 'em down)
Kill the lights  (Don't be scared, make a move, see me now?)
Kill the lights (I feel you watching me watching you)
Kill the lights (You can't handle the truth, what happened to 'em?)

[Post-Chorus: Britney Spears]
I kill the lights, the lights, the lights (Pure satisfaction)
I kill the lights, the lights, the lights (Lights, camera, action)
I kill the lights, the lights, the lights (Pure satisfaction)
I kill the lights, the lights, the lights (Lights, camera, action)

[Bridge: Britney Spears]
You're the star now, welcome to the big league
They all want a pic, they all wanna see, see, see
What you're made of, what you're gonna do
Is life gonna get the best of you?

[Chorus: Britney Spears]
Kill the lights (Take 'em out, turn 'em off, break 'em down)
Kill the lights  (Don't be scared, make a move, see me now?)
Kill the lights (I feel you watching me watching you)
Kill the lights (You can't handle the truth, what happened to 'em?)

[Post-Chorus: Britney Spears]
I kill the lights, the lights, the lights (Pure satisfaction)
I kill the lights, the lights, the lights (Lights, camera, action)
I kill the lights, the lights, the lights (Pure satisfaction)
I kill the lights, the lights, the lights (Lights, camera, action)

[Outro: Britney Spears]
Yeah, yeah

[Intro]
Your touch, your taste, your breath, your face
Your hands, your head, you're sweet, your love
Your teeth, your tongue, your eye, you're mine
Your lips, you're fine, you're Heaven on Earth

[Verse 1]
I've waited all my life for you
My favorite kiss
Your perfect skin, your perfect smile
Waking up and you're next to me (I feel you next to me)
Wrap me up in your arms and back to sleep

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Lay my head on your chest and drift away
(The palest green I've ever seen, the color of your eyes
You're taking me so far away, one look and you stop time)
I dream of you and I'm almost half awake
(The palest green I've ever seen, the color of your eyes
You're taking me so far away, one look and you stop-)

[Chorus]
Fell in love with you and everything that you are
Nothing I can do, I'm really crazy about you
When you're next to me, it's just like Heaven on Earth
You're Heaven, you're Heaven, you're Heaven on Earth
Tell me that I'll always be the one that you want
Don't know what I'd do if I ever lose you
Look at you and what I see is Heaven on Earth
I'm in love with you

[Post-Chorus]
Your breath, your face, your hands, your head
You're sweet, your love, your tongue

[Verse 2]
I'd move across the world for you
(The world)
Just tell me when, just tell me where
I'll come to you
Take me back to that place in time
Images of you occupy my mind

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Far away, but I feel you here with me
(The palest green I've ever seen, the color of your eyes
You're taking me so far away, one look and you stop time)
Dream of you and you're almost next to me
(The palest green I've ever seen, the color of your eyes
You're taking me so far away, one look and you stop-)
Yeah

[Chorus]
Fell in love with you and everything that you are
Nothing I can do, I'm really crazy about you
When you're next to me, it's just like Heaven on Earth
You're Heaven, you're Heaven, you're Heaven on Earth
Tell me that I'll always be the one that you want
Don't know what I'd do if I ever lose you
Look at you and what I see is Heaven on Earth
I'm in love with you

[Bridge]
Fall off the edge of my mind
(I fall off the edge of my mind)
I fall off the edge of my mind for you
Fall off the edge of my mind
(The palest green I've ever seen, the color of your eyes)
I fall off the edge of my mind for you
(Taken me so far)

[Chorus]
Fell in love with you and everything that you are
(Your touch, your taste, your breath, your face
Your hands, your head)
Nothing I can do, I'm really crazy about you
When you're next to me, it's just like Heaven on Earth
You're Heaven, you're Heaven, you're Heaven on Earth
(Your touch, your taste, your breath, your face
Your hands, your head)
Tell me that I'll always be the one that you want
Don't know what I'd do if I ever lose you
(Your teeth, your tongue, your eye, you're mine
Your lips, you're fine)
Look at you and what I see is Heaven on Earth
I'm in love with you

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
I'm not ashamed of my beauty, you can see what I got
(Shit, might I freak ya out, 'magine if I work ya out)
If I get on top, you're gonna lose your mind
(The way I put it down on you, you know should be a crime)

[Verse 3: Danja]
I understand, that you don't got no man
And I just want to take your hand
And I need you to understand
That, that, that I, I got everything perfect
When I take one, get it all inside
Work that body, get it all poppin' (You got it)

[Verse 1]
Did I wake you?
Were you sleeping?
Were you still in the bed, or is a nightmare keeping you up instead?
Poor baby, are you feeling guilty for what you did?
If you think you're hurting, you ain't seen nothing yet

[Pre-Chorus]
Was it really worth it?
Was she everything that you were looking for to feel like a man?
I hope you know that you can't come back
'Cause all we had is broken like shattered glass

[Chorus]
You're gonna see me in your dreams tonight
My face is gonna haunt you all the time
I promise that you gon' want me back
When your world falls apart, like shattered glass
Glass, glass, glass

[Verse 2]
Are you having trouble focusing throughout the day?
Do you find yourself still calling my name?
Do you wish you could rewind time and take it back?
I bet you realize that she ain't half the woman I am

[Pre-Chorus]
Was it really worth it?
Was she everything that you were looking for to feel like a man?
I hope you know that you can't come back
'Cause all we had is broken like shattered glass

You're gonna see me in your dreams tonight
My face is gonna haunt you all the time
I promise that you gon' want me back

'Cause I've been waiting here forever

Ten PM 'til four and I came to hit the floor
Thought you knew before, but if you don't, then now you know
Yo, tonight I'm 'bout to mash, make them other chicks so mad
I'm 'bout to shake my ass, snatch that boy (so fast)

[Pre-Chorus]
It's all about me and you, doing how we do
Tear the floor up-up-up, tell 'em to make room
If they wanna know, tell 'em mind their own
But if they wanna look, we can give 'em a encore

[Chorus]
Make it a freakshow, freakshow
We can give 'em a peep-peepshow, peep-peepshow
Don't stop it, let it flow, let your inhibitions go
It's a crazy night, let's make a-make a freakshow

[Post-Chorus]
Make it a freak-freakshow, a freakshow, a freakshow
Make it a freak-freakshow, a freakshow, a freakshow

[Verse 2]
Make 'em clap when we perform, wanna be crazy? We can show 'em
Dancing table top, freaky freaky, so outside the norm
On some super star ish, pushing hot Bugatti whips
Rocking new designer fits, we can do it if you're with it

[Pre-Chorus]
It's all about me and you, doing how we do
Tear the floor up, up, tell 'em to make room
If they wanna know, tell 'em mind their own

We can give 'em a peep-peepshow, peep-peepshow
Don't stop it, let it flow, let your inhibitions go

[Verse 1]
I'm out the door, it's automatic, simple, babe
(Why you wanna do that to me?)
I'm like a fire, bottle busting in your face
(Why you wanna do that to me?)
So tired of you being up in my space
(What you gonna do with that?)
How much more could I take?
I'm tired of privates driving
Need a general that ain’t weak

[Pre-Chorus]
When I shut the door, leaving with my bag
Hit the scene in my new wagon
Bet he gonna wish he knew
The type of fun I'm getting into
Peek-a-boo, he good
Doing things you wish you could
He's not talking, he's just walking
Like them city boys from New York

[Chorus]
This time I need a soldier, a really bad ass soldier
That know how to take, take care of me
I'm so damn glad that's over
This time I need a soldier, I'm sick of toy soldiers

A boy that knows how to take care of me
Won't be just coming over

[Post-Chorus]
I don't want no more (Break me off)
Oh, toy soldiers
I'm simply sick and tired of those
Oh, toy soldiers
I don't want no more
Oh, toy soldiers
I'm simply sick and tired of those
Oh, toy soldiers

[Verse 2]
I want it more than ever now
I realized that they ain't listening
Like a princess supposed to get it
That's why I'm dusting off my fitted
Coming back looking delicious
Yes, I know they wanna kiss me
Now I hold them at attention
'Cause new Britney's on a mission

[Pre-Chorus]
When I shut the door, leaving with my bag
Hit the scene in my new wagon
Bet he gonna wish he knew
The type of fun I'm getting into
Peek-a-boo, he good
Doing things you wish you could
He's not talking, he's just walking
Like them city boys from New York

[Chorus]
This time I need a soldier, a really bad ass soldier
That know how to take, take care of me
I'm so damn glad that's over
This time I need a soldier, I'm sick of toy soldiers

A boy that knows how to take care of me
Won't be just coming over

[Bridge]
Brit, I heard that he was saying he's still in love with you, and

Won't be just coming over

[Verse 1]
This kitten got your tongue tied in knots, I see
Spit it out, 'cause I'm dying for company

You know that I can take it to the next level, baby
If you want this good -ish, sicker than the remix
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before

Hotter than the A-list, next one on my hit list

Come here, closer, don't be shy
Cross my heart and hope to die

Wanna taste forbidden fruit
And seal it with a kiss (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Like telepathy, I know what you're thinking

Wanna taste forbidden fruit
And seal it with a kiss (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

The Femme Fatale

[Verse 1]
They couldn't believe I did it, but I was so committed
My life was so restricted for you (For you)
I just dove inside it blind, couldn't see what swam inside
Thought that'd be romantic for you

[Verse 2]
Exchanged my vows and said it all, on the ledge prepared to fall
Even screaming, damn it, for you (Remember?)
My friends said you would play me, but I just said they're crazy
While I was crying frantic, was it true?

[Chorus]
Why should I be sad? Heaven knows
From the stupid freaking things that you do (Stupid freaking things)
Why should I get mad? Feel sad? Who knows?
Just take it all as a sign that we're through (Goodbye)

[Post-Chorus]
It's time for me to move along (Goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on (Okay)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright)
It's time for me (Britney, let's go)

[Verse 3]
I sent you to Vegas with a pocket full of paper
And with no ultimatums on you
I thought "What could separate us?"
But it just seemed that Vegas only brought the player outta you
(Hey baby, what's your name?) (You think?)

[Verse 4]
Lavish homes and fancy cars, even got the drop Ferrari
Filled up our garage for you
Made your choice with all the teams, People and US Magazines
Tell me, who'd I do that for? Who?

[Chorus]
Why should I be sad? Heaven knows
From the stupid freaking things that you do (Stupid freaking things)
Why should I get mad? Feel sad? Who knows?
Just take it all as a sign that we're through (Ah, c'mon) (Goodbye)

[Post-Chorus]
It's time for me to move along (Goodbye) (C'mon)
It's time for me to get it on (Okay)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright) (C'mon)
It's time for me (Britney, let's go)
It's time for me to move along (Goodbye) (C'mon)
It's time for me to get it on (Okay) (C'mon)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright)
It's time for me (Britney, let's go) (Ah, c'mon)

[Bridge]
And don't you worry about our angels
All the magazines trying to intervene, saying things in the gossip section
They'll get good guidance and be trained well
Don't worry, I'll keep our little secret, but I ask this question

[Chorus]
Why should I be sad? Heaven knows
From the stupid freaking things that you do (Stupid freaking things)
Why should I get mad? Feel sad? Who knows?
Just take it all as a sign that we're through (Goodbye)

[Post-Chorus]
It's time for me to move along (Goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on (Okay)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright)
It's time for me (Britney, let's go)
It's time for me to move along (Goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on (Okay)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright)
It's time for me (Britney, let's go)
It's time for me to move along (Goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on (Okay)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright)
It's time for me (Britney, let's go)
Yeah, ah, c'mon

There was a time I used to think
That love would never turn into reality
I never thought I'd find the one
The odds I would run into you was slim to none

[Pre-Chorus]
You must be from heaven, baby, yes, you are
Your love is like a shooting star
So they can try, but they can't touch (touch)
You got to look up to us

[Chorus]
'Cause your love is outta this world (Oh)
How you bring me down to Earth
I love how you put me first
Baby, feel my every word
'Cause I’m singing universes about you

Our love is here is to stay
There’ll always be a song about you
Forever and a day
There’ll always be a song about you

[Verse 2]
I'll be your moon (moon), I'll make it bright (bright)
And when it's dark, I promise that you'll see the light (light)
And just as far as the moon from the sun (sun)
That's how long that I'll be here and it's because

[Pre-Chorus]
You must be from Heaven, baby, yes, you are
Your love is like a shooting star (oh, no)
So they can try, but they can't touch (touch)

In my sky, we're the stars
I'm on Venus, you're on Mars
People can't understand
How I'm your girl and you're my man, yeah
In my sky, we're the stars
I'm on Venus, you're on Mars
People can't understand
How I'm your girl and you're my man (yeah, baby)

[Chorus]
'Cause your love is outta this world (Oh)
How you bring me down to Earth
I love how you put me first
Baby, feel my every word
'Cause I’m singing universes about you
I keep singing universes about you
There’ll always be verses about you
Our love is here is to stay
There’ll always be a song about you
Forever and a day
There’ll always be a song about you

Assuming that you're into me
So fierce, the way you pierce me with your energy
My heart's on fire
Boy, come on and rescue me

[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears]
When I see you, I need you right away (Taking me)

So intense when your scent's in my vicinity
Body shaking, aching, I can't take it
How I want you so bad, boy, that I can taste it now

[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears]
When I see you, I need you right away (Taking me)
Can't control the way that I am behaving

Fellas get wild, start flashing your money
Ladies go crazy and act a fool
Everybody get down and do what you want to
The night is still young to be seduced
Taking in every little thing I see
Triple tie dancing with the tab complete
Little boys dancing 'cause they feeling me
Sweating cold, fretting, it's the place to be
Come and sit with me, come and sit with me
Sit back, you'll see it so beautifully
Lovin' everybody, baby, is all you need
Let go of the way things used to be

Everybody

Everybody's looking for something, everybody
Everybody
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 1]
Nothing about you is typical
Nothing about you's predictable
You got me all twisted and confused
It's all new
Up 'til now, I thought I knew love
Nothing to lose and it's damaged
'Cause patterns will fall as quick as I do, but now

[Pre-Chorus]
Bridges are burning
Baby, I'm learning a new way of thinking of love
I can see, nothing will be just like it was
Is that because?

[Chorus]
Baby, you're so unusual
Didn't anyone tell you you're supposed to break my heart?
I expect you to, so why haven't you?
Maybe you're not even human 'cause
Only an angel could be so unusual
Sweet surprise, I could get used to
Unusual you

[Verse 2]
Been so many things when I was someone else
Boxer in the ring, tryna defend myself
And the private eye to see what's going on
That's long gone
When I'm with you, I can just be myself
You're always where you say you will be
Shocking, 'cause I never knew love like this could exist

[Pre-Chorus]
Tables are turning, my heart is soaring
You'll never let me down
Answer my call, here after all
Never met anyone like you

[Chorus]
Baby, you're so unusual
Didn't anyone tell you you're supposed to break my heart?
I expect you to, so why haven't you?
Maybe you're not even human 'cause
Only an angel could be so unusual
Sweet surprise, I could get used to
Unusual you

[Bridge]
Can't believe that I almost didn't try
When you called my name
Now everything is changed

[Chorus]
Baby, you're so unusual
Didn't anyone tell you you're supposed to break my heart?
I expect you to, so why haven't you?
Maybe you're not even human 'cause
Only an angel could be so unusual
Sweet surprise, I could get used to
Unusual you

See how it do it (When I'm on the floor)
I wonder if you're ready for the thing that I got
I told you before that I'mma keep it hot
See how it is when I walk up in the spot
Standing in line, ha, I think not

[Pre-Chorus]

Ladies on the floor, let me see you get low
Fellas at the bar, won't you spend a little dough?
This is how I do it when I'm tearing up the floor

[Pre-Chorus]

Turn the lights out
This shit's way too fucking bright
Why not poke my eyes out if you wanna mess with my eyesight?
Just let me get my head right

Where the hell am I?
Who are you?
What'd we do last night?
Hey, yeah, yeah
Who are you?
What'd we do last night?
Hey, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Can't remember what I did last night
Maybe I shouldn't've given in, but I just couldn't fight
Hope I didn't, but I think I might've
Everything, everything is still a blur
Can't remember what I did last night
Everything, everything is still a blur
Can't remember what I did last night
Everything, everything is still a blur

Everything, everything is still a blur

[Verse 1]
Baby, I can be your sweet, baby

With this fast car, I can really get far
And don't break my heart
Let's make out, let's make out, let's make out

[Chorus]
You can come take me away
There's no pressure, play all day

You can come take me away
There's no pressure, play all day

Help myself to anything that I want, so thank you

There's no way you move me
Watch me, dress me, can't impress me
I'm not changing, adjust

[Bridge]
I can't help myself, I'm just doin' what I do
Help myself to anything that I want, so thank you

Black jack, whiskey straight
Every day changes your life
You got the look that you know you're real bad
Yeah, baby, you're right
Everybody loves you, baby, you're the king of the night
And I'm the only one making sure I stay out of your sight

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I can make your night
You wanna get it?
You got something that I like
But I might regret it

[Chorus]
Me and you were a disaster
And you're only a danger to me
But the party ain't the same without you
That's why you're so good for everybody else, but you're trouble for me

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Yeah, you're trouble for me
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Trouble for me

[Verse 2]
Sweet talk, here we go
Tell me something credible
You drive me crazy every time that I smell your cigarettes and cologne

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I can make your night
You wanna get it?
You got something that I like
But I might regret it

[Chorus]
Me and you were a disaster
And you're only a danger to me
But the party ain't the same without you
That's why you're so good for everybody else, but you're trouble for me

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Yeah, you're trouble for me
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Trouble for me

[Bridge]
Kiss, kiss, tip your glass
I'll do whatever you ask for
But if you want my love, you can only find it on the dance floor

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I can make your night
You wanna get it?
You got something that I like
But I might regret it

[Chorus]
Me and you were a disaster
And you're only a danger to me
But the party ain't the same without you
That's why you're so good for everybody else, but you're trouble for me

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh-oh...)
Yeah, you're trouble for me
Yeah, you're trouble for me
Yeah, you're trouble for me

[Outro]
You know I can make your night
You wanna get it?
You got something that I like
But I might regret it

[Verse 1]
For tonight, it's just the two of us
Dim the light now, just the two of us
Like how you roll, whisper in my ear
Your breath like ghosts that disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me close, hold me close, hold me tight now
Need you more, want you most, feels so right now
Like how your hands feel me up and down
Like how your touch send me off the ground

[Chorus]
Spread my wings out into the dark
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Break these chains that keep us apart
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart

[Verse 2]
Baby, can't believe you were sent to me
Like a postcard from my memory
Your body feels like a fantasy
This moment's all that I can see

[Pre-Chorus]
Pull me close, strip me down, hold me tight now
Need you more, want you most, feels so right now
Like how your hands never let me down
Like how your touch send me off the ground

[Chorus]
Spread my wings out into the dark
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Break these chains that keep us apart
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart

[Bridge]
Trip to your eyes, trip to your arms
Trip to your kiss, trip to your lips
Trip to your tongue, trip to your voice
Trip to your talk, trip to your heart
Trip to your head, trip to your chest
Trip to your breath, trip to your skin
Trip to your sin, trip to your touch
Trip to your tears, trip to your heart

[Chorus]
Spread my wings out into the dark
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Break these chains that keep us apart
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart

[Intro]
Do you feel this?
I know you feel this
Are you ready?
I don’t think so

[Verse 1]
Somebody give me my truck
So I can ride on the clouds
So I can turn up the bass like
Somebody pass my guitar
So I can look like a star
And spend this cash like

[Pre-Chorus]
What you gonna do when the crowd goes 'ayo'?
Why you standing on the wall?
Music starting everywhere
So why don’t you just move along?

[Chorus]
I see you lookin' at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don’t you do somethin'?
I see you lookin' at me
Like I got what you need
Get up out of your seat
Why don’t you do somethin'?

[Verse 2]
Now you all in my grill
'Cause I say what I feel
Only rock to what's real
Baby, bump, bump
But I can't do that with you
Only here with my crew
You can roll if you can
Don’t be a punk, punk

[Pre-Chorus]
What you gonna do when the crowd goes 'ayo'?
Why you standing on the wall?
Music starting everywhere
So why don’t you just move along?

[Chorus]
I see you lookin' at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don’t you do somethin'?
I see you lookin' at me

Get up out of your seat
Why don’t you do somethin'?
I see you lookin' at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don’t you do somethin'?
(Uh-huh)

[Bridge]
I see you lookin' over here
Can’t you tell I'm havin' fun?
If you know like I know
You would stop starin' at us
And get your own space
And do somethin'

[Chorus]
I see you lookin' at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don’t you do somethin'?
I see you lookin' at me
Like I got what you need
Get up out of your seat
Why don’t you do somethin'?
I see you lookin' at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don’t you do somethin'?

[Outro]
Fuck
Do somethin'
Ow!
Why don’t you do somethin'?

[Intro]
Oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
You're so bright, like a dream
You burn up everything
We might make a scene
Ignite gasoline

[Pre-Chorus]
When the music goes up and the sun goes down
Lightning strikes, and I'm on the ground
Only one that I want around is you
Yeah

[Chorus]
Spark, and it's like gasoline
I start burning, like a machine
My heart only runs on Supreme
So hot
Give me your gasoline, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
You're settin' me on fire, you're settin' me on fire
You're settin' me on fire, yeah
You're settin' me on fire, you're settin' me on fire
You're settin' me on fire, yeah

[Verse 2]
Heatwave on the floor
Escape, exit door
Your touch, burning me
It's too much gasoline

[Pre-Chorus]
When the music goes up and the sun goes down
Lightning strikes, and I'm on the ground
Only one that I want around is you
Yeah

[Chorus]
Spark, and it's like gasoline
I start burning, like a machine
My heart only runs on Supreme
So hot
Give me your gasoline, yeah

[Verse 1]
He is a hustler, he's no good at all
He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum
He lies, he bluffs, he's unreliable
He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun
I know you told me I should stay away
I know you said he's just a dog astray
He's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart

[Chorus]
But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

[Verse 2]
He is a villain by the devil's law
He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun
The man's a snitch and unpredictable
He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none
Oh, I know, should've let go, but no
'Cause he's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart

[Chorus]
But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

[Bridge]
And he's got my name
Tattooed on his arm, his lucky charm
So I guess it's okay, he's with me
And I hear people talk (People talk)
Try to make remarks, keep us apart
But I don't even hear, I don't care

[Chorus]
'Cause mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

[Outro]
(Oh, I know, oh) Mama I'm in love with a criminal
(Should've let go) And this type of love isn't rational
(But no) It's physical
(Oh, I know, oh) Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
(Should've let go) All reason aside
(But no) I just can't deny, love the guy

[Hook]
Down and up and down and up
And down and up and down
Down and up and down and up
And down and up and down

[Verse 1]
I got all tricked out and came up to this thing
Looking so fire hot, a 20 out of 10
I saw you watching me watching you on the floor
Hitting me up like 'What you waiting for?'

[Pre-Chorus]
It's alright to say you want it
Get inside my dirty mind
Burns like ice, the way I bring it
Again and again and again all night

[Chorus]
The beat just dropped and the room got sexy
You're watching me like there's no one else around
I know you want me like kids want candy
So keep watching me go down and up and down

[Hook]
Down and up and down and up
And down and up and down
Down and up and down and up
And down and up and down

[Verse 2]
All of them girls you're with are probably hating me
But I don't care, because I know it's jealousy
They see me on you like they think I'll give it up
But I ain't easy, just not afraid to rush

[Pre-Chorus]
It's alright to say you want it
Get inside my dirty mind
Burns like ice the way I bring it
Again and again and again all night

[Chorus]
The beat just dropped and the room got sexy
You're watching me like there's no one else around
I know you want me like kids want candy
So keep watching me go down and up and down

Down and up and down and up
And down and up and down
Down and up and down and up
And down and up and down
Down and up and down and up
And down and up and down
Down and up and down and up
And down and up and down

[Bridge]
I can almost feel my lace slipping off 'cause of the bass
I can tell that's what you're tripping on
Tripping on, tripping on
I can almost feel my lace slipping off 'cause of the bass
I can tell that's what you're tripping on
Tripping on, tripping on

[Chorus]
The beat just dropped and the room got sexy
You're watching me like there's no one else around
I know you want me like kids want candy
So keep watching me go down and up and down
The beat just dropped and the room got sexy
You're watching me like there's no one else around
I know you want me like kids want candy
So keep watching me go down and up and down

[Verse 1]
I'm touching hands with someone seriously beautiful, eh, ah-eh, eh
I feel it burning and I know I'm standing far too close, eh, ah-eh, eh
I'm telling lies and if it shows I see that he don't care, eh, ah-eh, eh
I know he wants to take me home and get on out of here, eh, ah-eh, eh

[Pre-Chorus]
I got someone waiting at home
He says he in love, but lately I just don't know
He don't see me or make me feel hot
Banging in the club with all my ladies and he don't know that

[Chorus: Ina Wroldsen]
He about to lose, 'bout to lose, 'bout to lose me
He about to lose me, eh, eh
He about to lose, 'bout to lose, 'bout to lose me
He about to lose me, eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh

[Verse 2]
I feel my body losing focus as he touches me, eh, ah-eh, eh
And I should go, but I can't overcome this chemistry, eh, ah-eh, eh
He pulls me close before he whispers something in my ear, eh, ah-eh, eh
He says he wants to take me home and get me out of here, eh, ah-eh, eh

[Pre-Chorus]
I got someone waiting at home
He says he in love, but lately I just don't know
He don't see me or make me feel hot
Banging in the club with all my ladies and he don't know that

[Chorus: Ina Wroldsen]
He about to lose, 'bout to lose, 'bout to lose me
He about to lose me, eh, eh
He about to lose, 'bout to lose, 'bout to lose me
He about to lose me, eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh

[Bridge]
Someone by the bar keeps looking at us dancing
I see him staring at me, I see what he wants to be
Someone by the bar keeps looking at us dancing
I gotta, I gotta go, he don't know that

[Chorus: Ina Wroldsen]
He about to lose, 'bout to lose, 'bout to lose me
He about to lose me, eh, eh
He about to lose, 'bout to lose, 'bout to lose me
He about to lose me, eh, eh

[Intro]
Will you turn me up?
Yeah

[Verse 1]
This is the making of another cold, rude awakening
It's been too long anticipating
Hurry up for my demonstration
So give undivided attention

[Pre-Chorus]
Okay, light speed, turbo, to get to me
Don't play, joke around, one shot
You're killing me

[Chorus]
Don't keep me waiting
Don't keep me waiting
My body's waiting
Don't keep me waiting

[Post-Chorus]
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come, and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come, and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come, and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come, and take it from me

The time is ticking
The train is boarding, you might miss it
Follow directions, damn it, listen
Before my body's in remission
So, come to your destination

[Pre-Chorus]
Okay, light speed, turbo, to get to me
Don't play, joke around, one shot
You're killing me

Don't keep me waiting
Don't keep me waiting

[Bridge]
What the hell?
I'm standing, what the hell?
Standing outside, I'm standing outside
What the hell? I'm standing outside
Colder than the freezer
Come out, and melt my ice
I'm running out of time
You're changing my demeanor
So get me to your ride, before I change my mind
Don't apologize

[Chorus]
Don't keep me waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Don't keep me waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
My body's waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Verse 1]
French finger tips, red lips
Bitch is dangerous
Cotton candy kiss
Can't wait for my sugar rush

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't take it no more
I've got to have more tonight
This feeling so strong
I'm putting you on tonight
Alright, let's go

[Chorus]
Baby, take a seat
Eyes on me, this is my show
Your one and only pleasure
All decked in lace and leather
Fantasy, courtesy of me, baby, let's go
Watch me apply the pressure
All decked in lace and leather

[Verse 2]
Heels, six-inch
Makes a boy wanna bite his lip
Look, but don't touch
Unless you wanna lose your innocence

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't take it no more
I've got to have more tonight
This feeling so strong
I'm putting you on tonight
Let's go

[Chorus]
Baby, take a seat
Eyes on me, this is my show
Your one and only pleasure
All decked in lace and leather
Fantasy, courtesy of me, baby, let's go
Watch me apply the pressure

Leather, leather, leather, leather, leather
Lace and leather, lace and leather
Leather, leather, leather, leather, leather
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

[Chorus]
Baby, take a seat
Eyes on me, this is my show
Your one and only pleasure
All decked in lace and leather
Fantasy, courtesy of me, baby, let's go
Watch me apply the pressure
All decked in lace and leather
Baby, take a seat
Eyes on me, this is my show
Your one and only pleasure
All decked in lace and leather
Fantasy, courtesy of me, baby, let's go
Watch me apply the pressure
All decked in lace and leather

[Verse 1]
Tiny hands
Yes, that's you
And all you show
It's simply true
I smell your breath
It makes me cry
I wonder how I've lived my life

[Chorus]
'Cause without you
How did I get through all of my days without you?
Now living with you, see everything's true
My baby, it's you
My baby, my baby, my baby

[Verse 2]
With no words at all
So tiny and small
In love, I fall so deep, so deep
My precious love sent from above
My baby boo, God I thank you
God, I thank you

[Chorus]
'Cause without you
How did I get through all of my days without you?
Now living with you, see everything's true
My baby, it's you
My baby, my baby, my baby
'Cause without you
How did I get through all of my days without you?
Now living with you, see everything's true
My baby, it's you
My baby, my baby, my baby

[Verse 1]
Lying in bed, touching my skin
Oh God, I wish you weren't sleeping
I long for your lips, to kiss me again
Don't you know my body's aching?

[Pre-Chorus]
Seems we always have a little price to pay
Price to pay, I'm falling in love
It all starts, starts to ache

[Chorus]
Bad girls, and bad little boys
Won't last forever
But good girls and good little boys
Will make love together

[Verse 2]
I look at your face, as I lie awake
My body's slowly moving closer
My hand on your leg
My mouth on its way
Oh baby, I'll just turn you over

[Pre-Chorus]
Seems we always have a little price to pay
Price to pay, I'm falling in love
It all starts, starts to ache

[Chorus]
Bad girls, and bad little boys
Won't last forever
But good girls and good little boys
Will make love together
Love together, love together
Love together, love together
Love together

[Bridge]
Do you like this? I like this
I want you alright
Do you want to touch me?
I like this
Can you handle this?
I like this
We're going to slow it down
Just a little bit
I'm lying in bed, touching my skin
I just can't take it, baby
Open your eyes, whisper to me
Do it again, do it again

[Chorus]
Bad girls, and bad little boys
Won't last forever
But good girls and good little boys
Will make love together
Bad girls, and bad little boys
Won't last forever
But good girls and good little boys
Will make love together
Love together, love together
Love together, love together
Love together

[Outro]
That's good, do you like this?
Yeah, going to slow it down
We'll make love together

[Verse 1]
Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance, and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move

[Chorus]
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people, go

[Verse 2]
Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget, no
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all, Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out
There's no way the band can lose

[Chorus]
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people

[Chorus]
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
I can feel it all, all, all-all-all over the people
Can't you feel it all over?
Come on, let's feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
Everybody, all over people, go

[Chorus]
Heart, I know I’ve been hard on you
I’m sorry for the things I’ve put you through
Before you start to break on me or ask for sympathy
I need to make you see
Oh, heart, I’m not sure it’s been long enough
To say that what I feel is really love
There’s just one way to learn, sometimes we’ll get hurt
And right now it’s our turn

[Bridge]
Give it time, help me through
Heart, we can do this together
You’re my strength, you’re my soul
I need you now more than ever

[Verse 1]
Heart, all the hurt will soon be gone
If you’ll, if you’ll just keep on being strong
You will always be my friend, so keep on hanging in
And we’ll find love again

[Bridge]
Give it time, help me through (help me)
Heart, we can do this together
You’re my strength, you’re my soul (my strength)
I need you now more than ever

[Chorus]
Heart, I know I’ve been hard on you
I’m sorry for the things I put you through
Please don’t you break on me, I need to make you see
It wasn’t meant to be
'Cause you will always be my friend, so keep on hanging in
And we’ll find love again

[Interlude to Dear Diary]
"So Amanda, whatcha guys do on your date last night?"
"Oh he was so sweet. He took me to eat and brought me roses." (Aw..)
"And then we went back to his house and watched movies."
"You went back to his house?"
"Did you guys kiss?"
"I'm not telling you that!" (laughter)
"Oh my god, you did!"
"Shhh...oh my god."
"Look at that guy."
"He's so cute."
"And he's looking over here."
"Be quiet. Gotta be cool."
"Go talk to him."
"No...I'm too nervous."
"What would I say?"

[Verse 1]
You took your love away too fast
Left no chance to say, "Look back"
And now I know the truth, it makes it easier
Maybe when time goes by, I’ll understand

[Chorus]
Let’s pretend that I’ve moved on
And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away, I run away

[Verse 2]
You threw it all away
So blind (So blind)
You pushed me far from you in your life
Now I know the tears won’t lead to loneliness
Maybe when time goes by, I’ll understand

[Chorus]
Let’s pretend that I’ve moved on
And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away, I run away, I run away

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Let’s pretend that I’ve moved on
And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away, I run away
Let’s pretend that I’ve moved on
And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away

[Outro]
Let's pretend that I've moved on
And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you

[Intro]
So curious, so curious

[Verse 1]
I’m so curious about our love
I don’t understand, why you don’t take my hand
And tell me you care, I see all the signs
But if you want to be mine, don’t leave me up in the air

[Pre-Chorus]
Alright, baby
You better let your love show
Here’s what I’m telling you
Let me know or let me go

[Chorus]
I’m so curious, do you love me?
Do you wonder the way that I do? I do
I’m so curious, what do you think of me?
Boy, am I just a game
Or do you feel the same as I do?
So curious, so curious

[Verse 2]
I’m so curious about our love
If it’s make believe
Why don’t you set my heart free?
And tell me goodbye
But if it’s for real, tell me you feel for me
Way deep down inside
Oh, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Is this goodbye or hello?
Here's what I'm telling you
Let me know or let me go

[Chorus]
I’m so curious, do you love me?
Do you wonder the way that I do? I do
I’m so curious, what do you think of me?
Boy, am I just a game
Or do you feel the same as I do?
So curious

[Bridge]
All day, all night, I just dream of you
I think about all the things that we could do
I’m dying for and I’m living for the day
When you could have been up
And say you feel the same you feel like I do

[Chorus]
I’m so curious, do you love me?
Do you wonder the way that I do? I do
I’m so curious, what do you think of me?
Boy, am I just a game
Or do you feel the same?
I’m so curious, do you love me?
Do you wonder the way that I do? I do
I’m so curious, what do you think of me?
Boy, am I just a game
Or do you feel the same as I do?
Do you love me?
Do you wonder the way that I do? I do
I’m so curious, what do you think of me?
Boy, am I just a game
Or do you feel the same?

[Chorus] x2
I've got the urge
(I can't I can't)
I can't wait another minute
I’ve got the urge to herbal (ow baby baby)
Ow yeah yeah (ow yes)
I can't wait another minute
I've got the urge to herbal
It's all so natural

[Intro]
Rock
Rock

[Verse 1]
Rocking headspace
I'm tripping out
This is my place
What you're about

[Pre-Chorus]
If you come over, we can fly away together
Let's go

[Chorus]
Take me down, and you hold me right
Spin me all around, I feel so dizzy
I fall into you
You rock me (You rock me), you rock me, you rock me in
Can you hold me tight, and don't let go?
Take me in your arms, and bring me closer
Ooh, I want you
You rock me (You rock me), you rock me, you rock me in

[Verse 2]
If you want to, we can race
I'm super fast now
You wanna chase?
I can fake it, because you're mine
Double time now, so get in line

[Pre-Chorus]
If you come over, we can fly away, together
Let's go

[Chorus]
Take me down, and you hold me right
Spin me all around, I feel so dizzy
I fall into you

Take me in your arms, and bring me closer
Ooh, I want you
You rock me (You rock me), you rock me, you rock me in
(Rock me in, you rock me in)

[Bridge]
My world is spinning 'round you
Don't wanna let you down
I'm lost when you're around me
Take me so far away from here
Look how I'm spinning 'round you
Don't wanna let you down
I'm lost and can't be found now
Take me down, take me down

[Pre-Chorus]
If you come over, we can fly away, together
Let's go

[Chorus]
Take me down, and you hold me right
Spin me all around, I feel so dizzy
I fall into you
You rock me (You rock me), you rock me, you rock me in
Can you hold me tight, and don't let go?
Take me in your arms, and bring me closer
Ooh, I want you
You rock me (You rock me), you rock me, you rock me in

[Outro]
Rock me in, you rock me in
Rock me in, you rock me in
Rock me in, you rock me in
What's the use of paradise or everyday of livin'?
They spend and learn in Heaven, sin in Hell
What's the point of children
When evil got before them?
They learn in every tale we tell

There's no point in being kind
What's the use when love becomes an evil of the mind?

Oh Yeah!

What's the use of power
When the battle isn't equal
And we're all too scared to use it anyway?
What's the point of reason
When no one wants to listen?
Deliverance is all too far away

There's no point in being kind
What's the use when love becomes an evil of the mind?
Oh what's the use?

There's no point in being kind
What's the use when love becomes an evil of the mind?

Oh what's the use?
Tell me
Oh, what's the use?
What's the use?

Love becomes an evil of the mind
What's the use?
Love becomes an evil of the mind
What's the use?
What's the use?
What's the use?

[Verse 1]
We're not so different, you and me
'Cause we both share our share of obscenities
And everybody's got some freaky tendencies
Hidden or admitted, 'cause we all got needs

[Pre-Chorus]
And I make no apologies, I'm into phonography
And I like my bluetooth, buttons coming loose
I need my hands free
Then I let my mind roam, playing with my ringtone
He got service, I got service
Baby, we can talk all night (Go)

[Chorus]
Let's talk about biology
Make believe you're next to me
Phonography, phonography
Talk that sexy talk to me
Better make sure that the line is clean
Keep it confidential, you and me
Phonography, phonography
Dirty talking, call it phonography, hey!

[Verse 2]
I can follow all your commands
But there will be no talk of adding you to my plan
I'll keep you connected, 'long as you understand
That's how we should keep it, Mr. Telephone Man

[Pre-Chorus]
And I make no apologies, I'm into phonography
And I like my bluetooth, buttons coming loose
I need my hands free
Then I let my mind roam, playing with my ringtone
He got service, I got service
Baby, we can talk all night (Go)

[Chorus]
Let's talk about biology
Make believe you're next to me
Phonography, phonography
Talk that sexy talk to me
Better make sure that the line is clean
Keep it confidential, you and me
Phonography, phonography
Dirty talking, call it phonography, hey!

[Bridge]
Baby, if you're not alone, take me off speakerphone
What I'm 'bout to say right here is just for your ears to hear
If you need to hit me back, hit me back
I got a star 69 for that, for that
Go

[Chorus]
Let's talk about biology
Make believe you're next to me
Phonography, phonography
Talk that sexy talk to me
Better make sure that the line is clean
Keep it confidential, you and me
Phonography, phonography
Dirty talking, call it phonography, hey!
(Phonography)

[Outro]
Phonography
Go

[Verse 1]
I still see your coat hanging on the door
Never let anybody put one there before
My pillow's got your head printed on it
Baby, of all the guys, you were my favorite

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't ask me why
I just can't say goodbye
No, not tonight
No, I just can't say it

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm gonna hold on, yeah, I'm gonna hold on
Baby, gotta keep holding onto what we had
'Cause I don't wanna move on, so I gotta hold on
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand
Like quicksand, like quicksand
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand
Like quicksand, baby, like quicksand
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand

[Verse 2]
You came along, I didn't know of love
But now I know that sometimes it's just not enough
I hear your footsteps in my corridor
But it is just my heart, it's pounding like before

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish I could try
But I just can't say goodbye
No, not tonight
No, I just can't say it

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm gonna hold on, yeah, I'm gonna hold on
Baby, gotta keep holding onto what we had
'Cause I don't wanna move on, so I gotta hold on
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand
Like quicksand, like quicksand
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand
Like quicksand, baby, like quicksand
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand

[Bridge]
'Cause the ground is breaking, I can feel it shaking
Wish it was that easy, but it's not that easy
Gotta hold my hands out, gotta keep my head up
Gotta keep on breathing, baby, even if we're sinking
Even if we're sinking
Baby, even if we're sinking
Even if we are sinking
'Cause I just-just gotta, gotta hold

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm gonna hold on, yeah, I'm gonna hold on
Baby, gotta keep holding onto what we had
'Cause I don't wanna move on, so I gotta hold on
Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand
('Cause I just-just gotta, gotta hold)

[Outro]
Only got one life to hold on
We don't even need to be so strong
Only you and me, we need to hold on, and hold on
Only got one life to hold on
We don't even need to be so strong
Only you and me, we need to hold on, and hold on, and hold on
And hold on
And hold on
And hold on (Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand)
And hold on, and hold on
And hold on, and hold on
And hold on, and hold on
(Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand)
And hold on, and hold on
And hold on, and hold on
And hold on, and hold on
And hold on, and hold on
(Baby, because you and me are sinking like quicksand)
And hold on, and hold on

[Verse 1]
I saw him standing there in the parking lot
He asked if I came here a lot
And this is how I responded

[Pre-Chorus]
I forgot my name
I forgot my telephone number
If he wanna see me, he don't even know it
I forgot my address
Damsel in distress
I forgot my boyfriend was the one that had bought me this rock

[Chorus]
I get amnesia when I'm standing next to you
He's been with me for several years, I know this much is true
Didn't know it was over 'til you came on over
And told me that you just, just can't forget about me

[Verse 2]
I talk to my girls
I can talk to my girls, like crazy
To anyone, I'll speak my mind
I tell them off, it don't phase me
I'm not lazy, but boy lately
When I see you, I stutter
Words just slip away, like butterflies
I saw you standing there in the V.I.P. on Friday
We conversate up in my fantasies, like every day
But I'm a dud whenever you approach
Like yesterday, when you just came to say "Hello"

[Pre-Chorus]
I forgot my name
I forgot my telephone number
If he wanna see me, he don't even know it
I forgot my address
Damsel in distress
I forgot my boyfriend was the one that had bought me this rock

[Chorus]
I get amnesia when I'm standing next to you
He's been with me for several years, I know this much is true
Didn't know it was over 'til you came on over
And told me that you just, just can't forget about me
Me, me
This is how I do

[Verse 3]
I talk to most guys
I can talk to most guys like crazy
To anyone, I'll speak my mind
I tell them off, it don't phase me
But you shake me, boy, you make me stop and stutter
When we touch, I melt like butter
I saw you standing there in the VIP on Saturday
Now that I know you got a thing for me, I should be straight
Not the kinda girl who'll just let any guy get close
All I can say, is I'mma tell my guy he should just effin' go

[Pre-Chorus]
I forgot my name
I forgot my telephone number
If he wanna see me, he don't even know it
I forgot my address
Damsel in distress
I forgot my boyfriend was the one that had bought me this rock

[Chorus]
I get amnesia when I'm standing next to you
He's been with me for several years, I know this much is true
Didn't know it was over 'til you came on over
And told me that you just, just can't forget about me
Me, me
This is how I do
J.Cole wrote a beautiful and moving apology to individuals and families affected by autism who were understandably hurt by a verse in "Jodeci Freestyle". I share responsibility and offer my sincerest apologies for the pain this has caused. Individuals with autism have brilliant and creative minds, and their gifts should not be disparaged or discounted. This was a learning lesson for both of us, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to try to right this wrong. J. Cole and I believe that it is the right, responsible, and respectful decision to remove the lyric from the song.

[Verse 1]
Last night I took a walk in the snow
Couples holding hands, places to go
Seems like everyone but me is in love
Santa, can you hear me?
I signed my letter that I sealed with a kiss
I sent it off, it just said this:
"I know exactly what I want this year"
Santa, can you hear me?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I want my baby, baby
I want someone to love me
Someone to hold
Maybe, maybe (maybe, maybe)
He'll be all my own in a big red bow

[Chorus]
Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing:
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year

[Verse 2]
Christmas Eve, I just can't sleep
Would I be wrong for taking a peek?
'Cause I heard that you're coming to town
Santa, can you hear me?
I really hope that you're on your way
With something special for me in your sleigh
Oh, please make my wish come true
Santa, can you hear me?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I want my baby, baby (oh)
I want someone to love me
Someone to hold
Maybe, maybe (maybe, maybe)
We'll be all the love under the mistletoe

[Chorus]
Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year

[Bridge]
I hope my letter reaches you in time, oh yeah
Bring me love I can call all mine, oh yeah yeah
'Cause I have been so good, so good this year
Can't be alone under the mistletoe
He's all I want in a big red bow

[Chorus]
Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here, oh yeah
Santa, that's my only wish this year (ah)
Oh, Santa! (ah)
Can you hear me? (ah)
Oh, Santa (ah)
Well, he's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here, oh yeah
Santa, that's my only wish this year

[Outro]
Santa, that's my only wish this year

[Intro]
People can take everything away from you
But they can never take away your truth
But the question is
Can you handle mine?

[Verse 1]
They say I'm crazy, I really don't care
That's my prerogative
They say I'm nasty, but I don't give a damn
Gettin' boys is how I live
Some ask me questions, why am I so real?
But they don't understand me
I really don't know the deal about my sister
Tryin' hard to make it right
Not long ago, before I won this fight

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions (Oh!)
That's my prerogative (That's my prerogative)

[Post-Chorus]
It's my prerogative
It's the way that I wanna live (It's my prerogative)
You can’t tell me what to do

[Verse 2]
Don't get me wrong, I'm really not souped
Ego trips is not my thing
All these strange relationships really gets me down
I see nothing wrong spreadin' myself around

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions (Oh!)
That's my prerogative (That's my prerogative)
Everybody's talkin' all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions (Oh!)
That's my prerogative (That's my prerogative)

[Post-Chorus]
It's the way that I wanna live (It's my prerogative)
You can’t tell me what to do

[Bridge]
Why can't I live my life
Without all of the things that people say?
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
(Oh!) Everybody's talkin' all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions (Oh!)
That's my prerogative

[Chorus]
(They say I'm crazy)
Everybody's talkin' all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
(They say I'm nasty)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions (Oh!)
That's my prerogative
It's my prerogative

[Verse 1]
You and I left alone, cannot be trusted
There's a lust we can't control
Slowly undress, chest to chest
And unless I say goodnight
I know we're only gonna go too far
'Cause I'm not quite ready for that next level
One kiss and that spells trouble (Trouble)

[Pre-Chorus]
You could talk me in
Talk me into it, if you wanted to
You could talk me in
Talk me into it, if you only knew
Yeah, I'm liking, I'm liking the way you do
What you do to me

[Chorus]
Ah, I don't wanna lose control
Control, control, control
But then again, ah
I think I wanna lose control
Control, control
Ain’t nothing wrong with a little bit of trouble
Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Tro-uble, trouble, trouble, trouble
You and me, that equals trouble
Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Tro-uble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Ain’t nothing wrong with a little bit of

I get down
I surprise you, don't you push me
Let me in your crib today
Next day, I'll snatch the goods away
You're not listening
Watch me now
'Cause I'm a good girl, but I can be bad
You're not quite there, you're not on my level
Trust me, for you, I'm trouble (Trouble)

[Pre-Chorus]
You could talk me in
Talk me into it, if you wanted to
You could talk me in
Talk me into it, if you only knew
Yeah, I'm liking, I'm liking the way you do
What you do to me

[Chorus]
Ah, I don't wanna lose control
Control, control, control
But then again, ah
I think I wanna lose control
Control, control
Ain’t nothing wrong with a little bit of trouble
Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble

This is a warning, I'm warning ya
You're taking too long (Too long)
Too long (Long)
Tryna play it laid back, and be cool
But boy, you're playing it wrong (Ooh-ooh)
Playing it wrong
Now, it's in your eyes (Eyes)
You're really, really (Really, really)
Looking like you wanna do something
Like, like you wanna do something (Do something)
Boy, you better get right (Right)

Paparazzi flashing
You jump on the stage
Sitting in the crowd
And I'm watching (I'm watching), baby
Groupies in the back
You're under attack
They're screaming your name, but I don't give a damn
'Cause I like it (I like it), I like it (I like it)

Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it (Yeah)
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me (Uh-huh)
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

[Post-Chorus: Rihanna with Britney Spears]
Na-na-na-na, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it,  like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, like it

[Outro: Rihanna & Britney Spears]
S-S-S and M-M-M
S-S-S and M-M-M
S-S-S and M-M-M
S-S-S and M-M-M

[Verse 1]
I'm coming down with a heartache tonight
Only you can make it all right
If I can be with you holding you tight
There won't be no more in my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Everywhere I turn I see your face
Reminding me of a higher place
Every time you smile angels cry
Every time you walk on by

[Chorus]
I'm not the only feeling lonely
Every time you walk on by
I try to say something
But end up with nothing
Every time you walk on by
(Every time you walk on by)

[Verse 2]
I keep my cool I pretend I'm not here
Every time you come too near
I'm such a fool cause, this love is true and
If I don't tell you someone else surely will

[Pre-Chorus]
Everywhere I turn I see your face
Reminding me of a higher place
Every time you smile angels cry
Every time you walk on by

[Chorus]
I'm not the only feeling lonely
Every time you walk on by
I try to say something
But end up with nothing
Every time you walk on by
(Feeling lonely)

[Bridge]
If I ever see you again
This craziness must find an end
I look at you
I promise myself

[Chorus]
I'm not the only feeling lonely
Every time you walk on by
I try to say something
But end up with nothing
Every time you walk on by
I'm not the only feeling lonely
Every time you walk on by
I try to say something
But end up with nothing
Every time you walk on by
Every time you walk on by
Every time you walk on by

Kanye, nigga-is you snorin' in my class?
Wake up Mr. West!

[Intro]
You're going to break another heart, you're gonna tell another lie

[VERSE 1: Johnny Cash]
Well here I am and there you go, you're gone again
I know you're gonna be the way you've always been
Breakin' hearts and telling lies is all you know
Another guy gives you the eye and there you go

[Chorus: Johnny Cash]
There you go, you're gone again
I should have known, I couldn't win
There you go, you're by his side
You're gonna break another heart, you're gonna tell another lie

[Verse 2 : Johnny Cash]
Because I love you so I take much more than I should take
I want you even though I know my heart is gonna break
You build me up and for a while I'm all a-glow
Then your fickle heart sees someone else and there you go

[Chorus: Johnny Cash]
There you go, you're gone again
I should have known, I couldn't win
There you go, you're by his side
You're gonna break another heart, you're gonna tell another lie

[Acapella Intro]
Mm mm mm
Doo doo doo da da da dum dum beh
Oh, eh, oh
Lost all of our woe
We lost all of our whoa-oh, sad love songs
Hey centipede, centipede, centipede, centipede, centipede...

[Chorus]
Oh, eh, oh
Lost all of our woe
We lost all of our woe-oh, sad love songs
Hey centipede, centipede, centipede...

[Verse 1]
'Bino, will you be my baby daddy? (Yup)
I'm too fresh, man, the world ain't never had me, yup
I'm too fresh, man, y'all ain't never gave me that
Stone Mountain, ain't no doubting, and these niggas won't hold me back, ah
They wasn't hating him anyway
My roommate exercise, man, he moving that heavyweight
My girl ain't down to ride, couldn't deal with my day to day
I'm at my Grandma's house, man, like I don't know what to say
Maybe "I'm sorry" but sorry don't pay the rent
I promise to pay you back and I don't know where he at
But tell him he missing out, his grandson cool as fuck
And tell me who be standing when them other ones giving up?
Let's keep it spontaneous, uh, I don't need that rehearsal
More flow, man, than Progressive commercials
Get with the program, 'cause the plus loan ain't putting us on
I got a month long before I take the bus home

[Chorus]
Oh, eh, oh
Lost all of our woe
We lost all of our whoa-oh, sad love songs
Hey centipede, centipede, centipede...

[Verse 2]
I know this music shit ain't shit
And all these random niggas in my house make you anxious
And I ain't never told you that our love would be painless
But I was so in love with you I thought we could make it
Damn, I wasn't in it, damn, we wasn't finished
Damn, I got us tickets, damn, we went to Venice
Prioritize on our lives and made you into a business
That's why you wasn't surprised when I had made my decision
Gotta make it, 'cause if not I'm a failure, my wallet Azalea
And my brother still moving, ain't no shit I can tell him
Trying keep him out of trouble, but the cops is wilding
And it's nice to have a felon when the boys get violent
The Mexicans tried to jump me at the club
Funny thing was I thought they were stepping to show me love
Grandma's couch, my biggest fear, and fantasy
When I ain't in her arms all I'm making is enemies
Hear 'em screaming obscenities at a nigga
Wanted to live bigger
Them Edenwald projects was eatin' our concept
Of anyone walking out, what is you talking about?
Gun Hill Road made them summers feel cold
On the same train that my parents met on
Twenty years later and my thoughts still ghetto
High off of pressure, man, that's a stiletto
Got your own couch now but you don't feel better

[Chorus]
Oh, eh, oh
Lost all of our woe
We lost all of our whoa-oh, sad love songs
Hey centipede, centipede, centipede...

[Bridge]
'Cause if not, I'm a failure
'Cause if not, I'm a failure
'Cause if not, I'm a failure

[Outro]
"It's not an unholy nigga, it's a Arab nigga in the store. You know what he want? Money, nigga. You know what your bitch want, you know why they feel they can't fuck with you? 'Cause you don't have no money, my nigga. Bitches do not want a nigga with no money. Did you not learn this in Harlem? Lesson number one. You can't keep saying you a Harlem nigga and you don't want that skrilla, nigga. Come on B, it's home of the hustlers, nigga. Nigga, that's all you gotta understand. It's the hood nigga. It's make guap or die, nigga."

"What do you think? 'Cause he gotta know, my nigga. Money is not evil, nigga. Go tell them niggas in Polo you don't wanna make no money, nigga. What they gon' say, "Oh, he right"? Hell no, nigga. You think niggas like selling crack and shit nigga? You think niggas like putting crack in they ass nigga, and selling cracks out they ass? You think niggas like shooting niggas, my nigga? You think niggas like tucking packs? You think niggas like baggin' up? You know how boring baggin' up is, my nigga? It's so boring, my nigga. There is no underground, Joe Budden is on his fourth mixtape selling shit. The underground is Koch, nigga. There is no underground nigga. You don't see Raekwon or none of these niggas on the block. You don't see none of them niggas on the block. There's no more block, nigga, it's over for the block. You ask any nigga on the block, do they wanna be on the block? They gon' say no, nigga. Get your money, man. Stop trying to be gooned out, my nigga

"Hood niggas don't want to be—"

"Hood niggas don't want to be hood niggas, my nigga. Everything niggas do, everything niggas do in the hood is for money, my nigga. What's one thing that niggas do in the hood that ain't for money? What bitch would want a nigga with no money? Huh? Huh!? Yo, slime! It's your time."
Where do you go when your conscience takes over
Do you crawl to your corner and cry
Did you imagine, that no one would notice
Just a secret to take when you die

All the world is watching you, every tongue is
Screaming sinner

How are your dreams, do they claw at your sleep
Making darkness a place you despise
Where is the god, that once was your strength
Are you sure he was there from the start

All the world is watching you, nowhere you can hide
Every tongue is screaming sinner, only satan hears your cries

When you sin cardinal sin, you make your bed and on it you must lie
And your futures looking grim, but did you ever give a damn
About the child, he's running wild
When you sin cardinal sin, don't you expect the world will treat you well
We say oh, go to hell
We point the finger, sin cardinal sin, laugh in your face, sin
Cardinal sin
We point the finger, laugh in your face
Cos you're no better than the rest of the human race

Oh sin cardinal sin, oh sin cardinal sin
Something about the way that you look on me
You watch every move, every word, every fantasy
Got no time for love, there's something on your mind
Got the face of an angel but the stare of a devil inside

[Hook]
I got hell looking up, heaven looking down
People say the woman's got an evil eye
I got hell looking up, heaven looking down
Free me from the woman with the evil eye

I turn away but still I see that evil stare
Trapped inside my dreams I know you're there
Thoughts of happiness you destroyed them all
First inside my head, then inside my soul

[Hook]
I got hell looking up, I got heaven looking down
People say the woman's got an evil eye
I got hell looking up, heaven looking down
Free me from the woman with the evil eye
Evil eye, evil eye, evil eye
Well it's a cold world
And I'm in the middle
Caught in the in-between

I don't belong here
So I'm writing to you
It's wrong here
Where I'm sending you some

Letters from earth, yeah

Well it's a new world
And now I'm a stranger
Stranger than you know

I don't belong here
And I'm writing to you
With blood on my hands

What if I send you madness
What if I send you pain
And letters from earth, ooh
All right
Come on it's another game
But you gotta play on
Cause they say it's just pretend
Ask them why they say you'll never, never die
Come on - the game is called the end

Well it's a cold world
And I'm in the middle
Caught in the in-between

I don't belong here
So I'm writing to you
Hey let me explain

What if I send you confusion
What is the time and the pain worth
Oh no no
I'm only sending -
Letters from the earth

Letters from earth
Letters from earth, yeah
Letters from earth, alright
Letters from earth
Letters from earth...
Spiritus Sanctus Anno Anno Mundi
Spiritus Sanctus Anno Anno Mundi

Can you see me, are you near me?
Can you hear me crying out for life?
Can you tell me, where's the glory?
Ride the days and sail the nights
When it's over you'll find the answer
Running in the whispering rain
Anno Mundi? Can you wonder!
Truth of thunder, life or blame

Do you see a vision of a perfect place?
Does it make you laugh, put a smile on your face?
Do you need a mirror, do you see it well?
Does the hand of God still toll the bell?
There are people laughing
They're all laughing at you
If only they could see what you're saying was true
Still generals fighting, making war on the world
Don't they know, don't they know?
No, no, no

[Hook]
As winds of night blows cold
Your eyes are burning
As the sands of our time grow old
Anno mundi

Do you follow the path that so many tread?
Are you among the blind so easily lead?
Do you join the war, do you fight for the cause?
Depend on another to fight it alone

[Hook]
As winds of night blows cold
Your eyes are burning
As the sands of our time grow old
No, no, no

Spiritus Sanctus Anno Anno Mundi
Spiritus Sanctus Anno Anno Mundi

Can you see me now, can you hear me now?
Can you tell me, where's the glory?
Ride the days and sail the nights
When it's over, you'll find the answer
Runnin' in the rain
Truth of thunder, life or blame
There's a hope that's growing and a vision too
All those angry hearts now reach out for you
Do you look to the dawn, see a new day begun?
No longer the fool, the vision is done

[Hook]
As winds of night blow cold
Your eyes are burning
And the sands of our time grow old
Your eyes are burning
And winds of night blow cold
Your eyes are burning
And the sands of our time grow old
Your eyes are burning
The horizon breaks, where a figure stands
Close your eyes and pray it's a vision of God's command

He's evil and mysterious, people fear his name
He's not here for deliverance, no, no, no
He's the Lawmaker
He's the Lawmaker

He never speaks, though his task we're told
To seek out souls of the sinners, he'll trade for gold

He's evil and mysterious, people fear his name
He's not here for deliverance, no, no, no
He's the Lawmaker
He's the Lawmaker

Silver mountains won't save you from hell
The prince of darkness inside you will dwell
Oh your weakness your past
The Lawmaker comes
He's evil and mysterious, people fear his name
He's not here for deliverance, no, no, no
He's the Lawmaker
He's the Lawmaker
He's the Lawmaker
He's the Lawmaker
The highway's screamin', callin' out your name
Cause every road that you travel on
There's a price to pay

A thousand eyes are starin'
But the blind still lead the blind

Where will you turn if it all goes wrong and you're on the run
Jerusalem?
Where will you turn if it all goes wrong and you're on the run
Jerusalem?

You say you walked through the valley
You say you've seen the signs
Echoes call you from a distant age
Or is it in your mind?

Then a thousands souls rise from the sea
Holding up the sun
And an angel cries beware your lies
It could be the end of it all
Where will you turn if it all goes wrong and you're on the run
Jerusalem?
Where will you turn if it all goes wrong and you're on the run
Jerusalem?

Everybody knows your name, every road leads to anger
Will it always be the same, is there reason to return?

Then a thousands souls rise from the sea
Holding up the sun
And an angel cries

Where will you turn if it all goes wrong and you're on the run
Jerusalem?

When an angel cries - Jerusalem
Better watch your lies - Jerusalem
When an angel cries - Jerusalem
Fire and water, wind and rain
Wings that carry hell in every vein
World possessions, endless tears
Truth and knowledge stolen all their years

World turns slowly, sun don't shine
Silence stills the air and kills the chime
Words are poison, passion bleeds
2000 years on earth has sown the seeds

The time of dreams has turned
The night is gone and light shines on
Where darkness once would hide
With spirits high, our fears were born

[Chorus]
Receiver of light, the kingdom of God will guide you
Keep you from a restless heart
Deceiver of night, the stranger that laughs within you
The reason for your restless heart
Is the keeper of the Sabbath Stones
Fire and water, wind and rain
Wings that carry hell in every vein
World turns slowly, sun don't shine
Silence stills the air and kills the chime

Can faith destroy desire? Each breath a prayer
Each step brings fear
The eyes of they that see have evil stare
Watch over me

[Chorus]
Receiver of light, the kingdom of God will guide you
Keep you from a restless heart
Deceiver of night, the stranger that laughs within you
The reason for your restless heart
Is the keeper of the Sabbath Stones

And He's the keeper of the Sabbath Stones

What God is this that stands to hear his people cry?
What hand would strike and watch his people die?
What life that takes, what future did we earn?
It's our mistakes, take heed the Sabbath Stones

What life that takes, what future did we earn?
It's our mistakes
As you walk alone the night surrounds you like a shroud
The dreams you had were once of love and being proud
Misty horizons block your vision of the world
But the raven's eyes will show you all you need to know

The land you loved is now so barren and so cold
The name of God rings out so high in your soul
This time the masters will lead us by the sword
And should we fail, then all prevails in Odin's court

Leading us on, to the land of eternity
Riding the cold, cold winds...
...of Valhalla

The Kingdom of Odin is the Kingdom of Gods
Where only souls of the brave may rest in peace
But someone among them had the skill of deceit
And raised the hand that would open the road to Hell

[Chorus]
When the winds of Valhalla run cold
Be sure that the blood will start to flow
When the winds of Valhalla run cold
Valhalla
Valhalla

The ring has been broken and a soul must be saved
Among the bravest of men, who rides to Hell
The longships are sailing and the chariots ride
And yes the anger of Thor will serve you well

[Chorus]
When the winds of Valhalla run cold
Be sure that the blood will start to flow
When the winds of Valhalla run cold
So raise your hands
Reach and Valhalla will save your soul
And raise your eyes
Odin will lead us on

They say that history repeats itself
Upon the year of the seventh Century
Well nobody knows, no you never can tell
So you'd better run now and hide away

[Chorus]
When the winds of Valhalla run cold
Be sure that the blood will start to flow
When the winds of Valhalla run cold

[Chorus]
When the winds of Valhalla run cold
Be sure that the blood will start to flow
When the winds of Valhalla run cold
The chapter is opened and the pages are turned
The writing say many things but who was concerned
Where can we run to now, when will we learn?
When it's lost, it's gone forever

For years they told me what I should to do
Down to the places I go and who I should talk to
But that don't matter no more since I found out the truth
And it feels good to me

The world is turnin'
Forever turnin'
Forever yearnin'
For the love of life
And you're wrong if you think that I'm afraid to love

It feels good
It feels good to me
It feels good
It feels good to me
I wonder, I wonder does it not seem strange to you
Just how the tables have turned on me and you?
How long can we go on livin', livin' the way we do?
When it's lost, it's gone forever

The world is turnin'
Forever turnin'
Forever yearnin'
For the love of life
And you're wrong if you think that I'm afraid to love

It feels good
It feels good to me
It feels good
It feels good to me
It feels good
It feels good to me
Feels good
It feels good to me

How long can we go on livin', livin' the way we do?

It feels good
It feels good to me
It feels good
Feels good to me
It feels good
It feels good to me
It feels good
Rising with the sun, the work has been done
But the people are starting to stare
Called from the afar to court of the Czar
Could it be something is wrong?

You stand face to face and your heart gathers place
For the answer to a question a prize
If only you had known to be honest was wrong
For the work that you've done you will pay with your eyes

Don’t be afraid to an ever-losing love

Into the black where the night
Never ends and the light
Leaves a scar on your soul
Where your heart used to hold
Your love here!
Heaven in Black

Inside there's a voice saying was there a choice
You'd still be entombed in the night
Lucifer's to blame, the reason for the flame
They've taken your sight but they'll not take your God
Don’t be afraid to an ever-losing love

Into the black where the night
Never ends and the light
Leaves a scar on your soul
Where your heart used to hold
Your love here!
Heaven in Black

Into the black where the night
Never ends and the light
Leaves a scar on your soul
Where your heart used to hold
Your love here!

Into the black where the night
Never ends and the light
Leaves a scar on your soul
Where your heart used to hold
Your love here!
Heaven in Black

[Verse 1]
Waiting for the revolution
New clear vision, genocide
Computerize God, it's the new religion
Program the brain, not the heartbeat

[Verse 2]
Onward all you crystal soldiers
Touch tomorrow, energize
Digital dreams and you're the next correction
Man's a mistake so we'll fix it, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Take a look at your own reflection
Right before your eyes
It turns to steel

[Chorus]
There's another side of heaven
This way - to technical paradise
Find it on the other side
When the walls fall down

[Verse 3]
Love is automatic pleasure
Virtual reality
Terminal hate, it's a calculation
Send in the child for connection

[Pre-Chorus]
Take a look at the toys around you
Right before your eyes
The toys are real

[Chorus]
There's another side of heaven
This way - to technical paradise
Find it on the other side
When the walls fall down

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Midnight confessions
Never heal the soul
What you believe is fantasy
Your past is your future
Left behind, lost in time
Will you surrender?

[Verse 4]
Waiting for the revolution
Program the brain, not the heartbeat

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
Deliver us to evil, deny us of our faith
Robotic hearts bleed poison
On the world we populate
Virtual existence with a superhuman mind
The ultimate creation, destroyer of mankind
Termination of our youth
For we do not compute
No

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
What do you say to the dead?
Will you forgive me for living?
Can't believe the things that they said
Wonderful day for a killing, it's killing me

[Verse 2]
What do they do with your soul?
Is it just lying there busted?
When did you lose all control?
Is there someone to be trusted with my mind?

[Verse 3]
Oh there's insufficient evidence
Of what just might come after
But sometimes out of nowhere
There's demented sounds of laughter

[Verse 4]
Are we all haunted by the ghost, imagination, it just can't be
I've seen them there, howling at the moon
Is it just me or does somebody else believe this?
Well I'm not alone and I'm not afraid
There's just one way to see

[Chorus]
After all, after all
After all, after all

[Verse 5]
What do you say to the dead?
Is there a place where it's burning?
It says in a book I once read
Yes, there's a chance of returning, turn to me

[Verse 6]
The fundamental principles, say nothing of forever
But those are voices that I hear or I'm just not so clever
It can't be me, I know somebody else believes this
Well I'm not alone, I'm not afraid, just one way to see

[Chorus]
After all, after all
Coming after all
After all, after all
After all, after all...
One day in the life of the lonely
Another day on the round about
What do they need
Somebody to love

One night in the life of the lonely
There's a miracle on the screen
What did they see
Somebody to love

He guarantees you instant glory
Get your money on the line

Gotta send me a plastic Jesus
There's a check in the mail today
That's what I need
Somebody to love

We just won't meet on Sunday
Gotta buy him a limousine
Somewhere to live
Somewhere to pray
Every penny from the people
Keeps the wolf outside the door
Shop around and find forgiveness for yourself
But he'll give you more, yeah

Holy father, holy ghost
Who's the one who pays the most
Rock the cradle don't you cry
Buy another lullaby

Jack is nimble, Jack is quick
Pick your pocket, turn a trick
Slow and steady, he's got time
To commit another TV crime
TV crime

One day in the life of the lonely
Back again on the round about
What do they need
Somebody to love, yeah

One night in the life of the lonely
Another miracle on the screen
What did they see
Somebody to love again
A supermarket of salvation
Take a look inside the store
Shop around and find forgiveness for yourself
But he gives more

Holy father, holy ghost
Who's the one who hurts you most
Rock the cradle when you cry
Scream another lullaby

Jack be nimble, Jack be slick
Take the money, get out quick
Slow and steady, so much time
To commit another
TV Crime, TV Crime

[Verse 1]
Look all around
Can't you open your eyes
Voices are calling
Killing rain falling down from the sky
Crying with nightmare tears
Out on the street
You'll see blood on the ground
Cities are burning
Feeling the pain cutting right to your soul
Goodbye now, you're caught in his spell

[Pre-Chorus]
Your freedom is gone
He's taken everything you ever had
But if you're strong you'll survive
You've got to hold on
Open your eyes

[Chorus]
Behind the lies you will see
The master of insanity
Under the mask there will be
The master of insanity

[Verse 2]
Innocent minds
They're the victims of shame
Staring in sorrow
Promises lying there
Broken and crushed
Confusion-just disappear
What can you give to be left all alone
When there's nothing at all

[Pre-Chorus]
Your freedom is gone
He's taken everything you ever had
But if you're strong you'll survive
You've got to hold on
Open your eyes

[Chorus]
Behind the lies you will see
The master of insanity
Under the mask there will be
The master of insanity
Behind the lies you will find
He's trying to get inside you
Just open your eyes and you will see
The master of insanity

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Behind the lies you will see
The master of insanity
Under the mask there will be
The master of insanity
Between the lies you will find
That he's trying to get inside you
Out of the night into your mind
He's always right beside you

[Outro]
Yeah, between the lies you will see
The master of insanity
Open your eyes or you will be
The master of insanity
Oh what are you gonna do
When there's a part of you that needs to run with the wind?

And the fire of burning yesterdays
Can only light the way
To lead you from the garden of the dark

Stay out of shadows, now
Looks like the change is on
Tomorrow's never gone
Today just never comes

Go on and jump, yeah
Into the hurricane
You will forget the pain
It's only there to exorcise your mind

Looking at the world
When you've opened up your eyes
You've got to see the promises they've made
They're bloody lies and broken dreams
Your silent screams
You're living in a time machine
And you can choose just who you are
Someone that you've never seen
Somewhere you've never been
You're living in a time machine

Oh what are you gonna do
When every part of you just needs to catch the wind?

And the fire of burning yesterdays
Can only light the way
To lead you from the garden of the dark

Looking for the world
When you've opened up your eyes
You'll see you've got invisible chains
They're only lies, not what it seems
I hear your silent screams

You're living in a time machine
Nobody cares just where you go
Taken where you've never been
Vacate to somewhere you don't know

Living in a time machine
Why do you stay who you are?
Be what you've never been
Someone you've never seen
You're living in a time machine
Yeah
I am the crazy man
Who lives inside your head
But I think I'm breaking through the wall

You are the innocent
Convicted of the crime
No one was ever there
To catch you when you fall

I see the diamonds
But you only see the rock
I need to run
But you only crawl

It's time to open up
All the doors that you keep locked
Nobody gives without a take
Let's take it all

You've been twisted into pieces
By the hands of your emotions
How much longer are you gonna pay
For yesterday
Sins of the father
One more crucifixion
One more cross to bear
You're a hole in a photograph

Go on - lose it in the city
The city can feel no shame
See the world with electric eye

They call it mystery
But any fool could see
You thought he walked on the water

And if the pain was gone
And you were free to run away
And get out

Would you get out of there
Or do you really care
It's not safe or easy
And maybe when you're gone
You just won't belong at all

You're the only witness
To the murder of an angel
How much longer are you gonna pay
For yesterday
Sins of the father
It's just another crucifixion
One more cross to bear
Go on lose it in the city
Take a look at the world
You've got electric eyes
Soon it's never more
When you've got to pay for promises
Made in the night
Call the magic one
And with the magic comes forever
Chained to the flame

It's too late
Too late for tears
Too late, no-one hears you
Do you feel the touch of evil?
It's too late

To wish and make it so
To feel the power growing stronger
Blessed by the dark
And when the candle fades
You can say it was a joke you played
So you must let me go, no

It's too late, you've said the word
Too late, something heard you
Too late, now the race is on
And you've run out of road
Too late for tears
Too late and no-one hears you
Can you feel the touch of evil?
It's too late
Save me
I believe in your name
I've fallen down
But now I've found nobody to take the blame

Misery
Come to drag me away
When the hunter cries, no alibis
Get ready for judgement day

As the candle fades
You can say it was a game you made
So you must let me go, let me go

It's too late, you've said the word
Too late, something heard you
Too late, the spell is gone
And this time you're the fool
It's too late for tears
Too late, no-one hears you
Welcome to forever
Welcome, it's too late, too late
I am anger under pressure
Left in cages, a prisoner
The first to escape

I am wicked
I am legion
Strength in numbers, a lie
The number is one

I, I, I
Everything that I see is for me

Yes, I am giant
I'm a monster
Breaking windows in houses
Buildings of glass
Rebel, rebel, holy outlaw
Ride together, don't try it
The power's in one

I, I, I
I am standing alone
But I can rock you
I, I, I
On the edge of the blade
But the knife can't cut the hero down
I am virgin, I'm a whore
Giving nothing, the taker
The maker of war
I'll smash your face in
But with a smile
All together, you'll never be
Stronger than me

I, I, I
Right here on my own
But I still rock you
I, I, I
Don't follow behind
Just leave me on the outside

I, I, I
I am standing alone
But I can shock you
I, I, I
On the edge of the blade
But no-one makes the hero bleed
No, no, no, no, no, no

I am hunger, no, no, no
Feed my head, no, no, no
All together, you'll never
Never make the hero bleed
No, no, no
Once upon a nightmare
Once upon a time
You're running from temptation
You got lost
And found that you don't

Belong to anybody
You're all the same
Just another number
Cross it out
Whenever you don't behave

Someone got the doctor
He knows what to do
Throw some bones and mumble
The devil's inside of you

It might be contagious
It might change the plan
Get back in your tiny boxes
Even if you can't
We say you can
Join the congregation
Everybody's got to get in line and
We never justify
The choir sings a never-ending lie

[Pre-Chorus:]
When you thought you were free
You didn't need a reason
No reason to survive

[Chorus]
As the big door closes
And you waiting for the nail
Somebody tell the world
You're buried alive

Once upon a nightmare
Once upon a time
You're running from tomorrow
You got lost
And found that another
Day has turned to ashes
Taken by the wind
Frozen seeds of sorrow
Never to begin
Join the celebration
And everybody's got to get in line and
We never justify
The choir sings a never-ending lie

[Bridge]
When you thought you were free
You did not need a reason
No reason to survive

[Chorus]
As the big door closes
And you waiting for the nail
Somebody tell the world
You're buried alive

One more nightmare
Just one more time
Join the congregation
Everybody get in line

Celebration
The choir sings a lie
As you call
The hammer falls
And no one hears you cry
I'm buried alive

Still rather get my car washed by a junkie (Yeah)
Across the desert of the burning dark
A darkness which illuminates you
There's a place you've always wanted to be
Whose pleasures always did escape you
It's always been so out of reach, nothing, so near
Ever felt so far
And now it's here within your grasp
A never ending burning says it all

As you drive into the darkness, in front the future
Behind you history
Caught alone in the dark night
Do you think that's the way it's supposed to be
You don't believe your eyes, cos all they see is lies, oh yeah

You better run from the holy man
The eyes that will are set up on you
Listen not to verse and prayer
Songs that thrill and voices tempt you
The inner flame has fear of death
Never has light ever seemed so dark
Pilgrims of sabbocracy
Hear the hounds of heaven, as they bark
As you drive into the darkness, in front the future
Behind you history
Caught alone in the dark night
Do you think that's the way it's supposed to be
You don't believe your eyes, cos all they see is lies

I witness a time and a place that never dies
Still frozen in time
This darkness the only place that I can hide
I witness, a dream

As you drive into the darkness, in front the future
Behind you history
Caught alone in the dark night
Do you think that's the way it's supposed to be
You don't believe your eyes, cos all they see is lies, oh yeah

I witness a time and a place that never dies
Still frozen in time
This darkness the only place that I can hide
I witness, a dream

I witness a time and a place that never dies
Still frozen in time
This darkness the only place that I can hide
I witness, a dream
Oh, just a dream
Don't come closer, because it ain't safe here
Just turn around now and walk away
I've gotta tell you, there are no rules here
Sometimes I wonder, what goes on there
Behind those eyes

[Hook]
When a promise is broken, and no one trusts you
And young ones cry with their heads in their hands
When you talk about saving the souls of the faithful
You can't help thinking you've got blood on your hands
From a cross of thorns
Cross of thorns

Tongues of fire always talking
Wasted words that ring in my ears
We're still waiting, losing patience
With all the lies of 400 years
I've got to tell you, there are no rules here
Sometimes I wonder, what goes on there
Behind those eyes

[Hook]
When a promise is broken, and no one trusts you
And young ones cry with their heads in their hands
When you talk about saving the souls of the faithful
You can't help thinking you've got blood on your hands

We gave you yesterdays, and now you want today
Oh, from the hands of death we take our daily bread
Now all we do is choke
And the words that you once spoke, fade away
Fade away
Look at what you've done
It's a cross of thorns
Cross of thorns

Take away
This cross of thorns
Look at what you've done
Look at what you've done
It's a cross of thorns

When a promise is broken, and no one trusts you
You've got blood on your hands, from a cross of thorns
Mortal eyes, looking through a veil of dreams
Hypnotized, and ever living soul with wings
Think you're god, but you never had control
Think you're loved, but there's no one there at all...

My colours all ran dry, and now I see the world in black and white
It's too late now, it's time to kiss the rainbow goodbye

Poison tears running from a palsied face
Satan nears, descending on the human race
Think you're god, but you wish had control
Think you're loved, but there's no one there at all...

My colours all ran dry, and now I see the world in black and white
It's too late now, it's time to kiss the rainbow goodbye

Listen to the wind, hear the gospel blow
Tell me that you don't hear what I'm hearing
And I will let you go
Look up to the sky, put your trust in me
Tell me that you ain't feelin' what I'm feelin'
And I will set you free
Look into the flame, see the embers glow
Tell me that you don't see what I'm seein'
And I will let you go
Taste the holy blood, runnin from my veins
Tell me that you ain't feelin' what I'm feelin'
And I'll take away the pain

Yes I will now, oh yes I will
It's time to kiss the rainbow goodbye
Reach out and take for me, fruit of the poison tree
Give me your body and your soul
My youth is fading fast, years melt into the past
This mortal life will take it's toll

I'm sick and tired of losing, you find this so amusing
It's all I have to keep myself in this state I'm in

This park of natures fire, my only one desire
This world is hanging by a thread

I'm sick and tired of losing, you find this so amusing
It's all I have to keep myself in this state I'm in

People always tried to change me
Alter everything I am
So many faces staring in on me
You left me in this state I'm in
Virtual death

You may think this existence is just a human weakness
Inside my mind it's near the end
Virtual death

I'm losing, I'm fading fast
I'm dying, virtual death
I'm floating, I'm fading fast
I'm dying, virtual death
In the daylight, comes darkness
On the verge of night a fear is born
Sweeter than the dream, the reality of you
Immaculate deception
Deception

From the spirit runs poison
And the wheel of fortune is ever still
Sweeter than the light, the darkness of your soul
Immaculate deception
Deception

Something has touched, the spirit inside
Once there was love now there's a void
Nights of deception, ghosts in my mind
Am I bewitched, slave to desire

It's knowing that times keeps rolling on
Night after day, day after night
It's knowing that feeling of coming home
To where my spirit lies
It's knowing that feeling of coming home
To where my spirit lies
Can you hear, the people sing their song
To tunes of glory, they move as one
Refugees of liberation marching on
Sing your songs, rock the nation, write of wrongs

When you take a life and steal it's shadow
All that's left is humanity

It's getting closer, change is bound to come
There's someone out there, holding candles to the sun
Then an answer, says that peace will come around
Stand in line, take your time and be proud

Take a life and steal it's shadow
All that's left is humanity
Take a man and steal tomorrow
All that's left is you and me

Hear them call you, soldiers all in the field of love
Brothers, sisters, children all dying for love
Refugees of liberation marching on
Sing your songs, rock the nation, write of wrongs

Take a life and steal it's shadow
All that's left is humanity
Take a man and steal tomorrow
All that's left is you and me

Hear them call you, dying for love
Those who know you, dying for love
Brothers, sisters, dying for love
Saints and sinners, dying for love
Dying for love
We are the star demons, reaching out yeah
We want to touch your world
We are the dream makers, pure and sweet yeah
We're gonna change your world

[Hook]
When you're tired of giving reasons
And freedom fighting freedom
If you're searching for an answer
We can bring you back to Eden

There's no need for pain and anger
The power of peace can destroy the gun
Leave behind man's vanity yeah
And living life on the run

[Hook]
When you're tired of giving reasons
Always fighting for your freedom
If you're searching for an answer
We can take you back to Eden
Is god forgiving, is this the final warning
Watching as the future turns
Science fiction, real life addiction
The human race will never learn

[Hook]
When you're tired of giving reasons
And freedom fighting freedom
If you're searching for an answer
We can bring you back to Eden

Back to Eden
Back to Eden
Back to Eden
Gonna bring you back
Young life, too young, who's eyes are choking
Can't rest, can't sleep, for dreams that set you falling
Don't feel the hunger, can't drink no holy water
No light in these eyes, no place for dreams at all tonight

When the hand that rocks the cradle
Is the hand that holds the knife
And the knife that cuts the cable
Kills the spark that feeds the life

[Hook]
No grave could be deep enough
Down to hell if we were able
The veil of life was pushed aside
By the hand that rocks the cradle

The oath you take is sacred
To save not steal a life
Like the ending of the sweetest soul
That looked through human eyes

[Hook]
No grave could be deep enough
Down to hell if we were able
The veil of life was pushed aside
By the hand that rocks the cradle

Young life, too young, who's eyes are choking
Can't rest, can't sleep, for dreams that set you falling
Don't feel the hunger, can't drink no holy water
No light in these eyes, no place for dreams at all tonight

It's the hand that rocks the cradle
It's the hand that steals the life
It's the hand that rocks the cradle
It's the hand that steals the life
This is no ordinary soul, that you're destroying
Not just another life that drifts along with the sands of time
We tried to show you on your way, but still
You cannot see, you're hurting me
You told too many lies and so it ends, yeah

You tried to touch me, but then I knew your plan
You tried to take my world away, oh no
Now I see it, it's as clear as day
No you'll never stand a chance, oh no you'll never stand a chance

You tried to lead me, to the land where you keep your lies
But I've seen this road before, oh yeah
There is no reason why I should listen now
No you'll never stand a chance, oh no you'll never stand a chance

So many people tried before
But still I came through stronger than before
Someone like you will never get through my door no more

Nothing you can do will hurt me, I am indestructible
Nothing you can do will hurt me, I am indestructible, yeah
Every lie that you tell you get closer
Closer to the edge of the Cauldron and in to the fire, yeah
Every life you destroy will return, it will come back and haunt you
For ever and ever

Nothing you can do will hurt me, I am indestructible
Nothing you can do will hurt me, I am indestructible, yeah

This is no ordinary soul that you're destroying
Not just another life that drifts along with the sands of time
It's a loaded dice, that you throw this time
If you turn the Ace, it'll turn out fine
When you spin the wheel, and you get your call
South of the line, well the loser gets it all

One too many days, one too many nights
You cried too many tears, had too many fights
And you know it's a bad time, Bad time to lose

Every face you see, has the staring eyes
Every passing glance, makes you realize
And you know it's a bad time, Bad time to lose

God knows there's no good time

Too many days, and too many nights
You cried too many tears, had too many fights
And you know it's a bad time, Bad time to lose
Yeah, yeah, Bad time to lose
Bad time to lose, Bad time to lose
What is it that turns you on to the illusion of power
This thing that grabs you by the heart and makes you want to tear things down
There is no reason why I should need all this power, but if you cross me now
I'm gonna tear your whole world down

The illusion of power, things that I feel, seem so real
The illusion of power

I can't get the emotional thing straight in my head
Everything I love dies too soon, or is already dead
Don't stand too close I spit and breathe fire
Anything I've got now you cannot desire

You want to be my friend I promise you nothing
Nothing I can give you, nothing I can do for you
I'm being chased by the sins of my past and it's killing me now
Killing me now

The illusion of power, things that I feel, seem so real
The illusion of power
The illusion of power, it's already set signed and sealed
The illusion of power
Powerful...who are you fooling?
You're caught in a complex cataclysm of your own inadequacies
And pitiful weaknesses
Your souls secretes insecurity
So you live on the reflection side of the mirror
You're terrified of true power...you fear me...

I can tell you stories of my
Shaded past and I can
Drag you down into the
Depths of my soul

The illusion of power, things that I feel, seem so real
The illusion of power
The illusion of power, it's already set signed and sealed
The illusion of power

Why don't you come closer
Promise a story I will tell, yeah
I'll save you from your dreams, yeah
I'll save you from your dreams

It's illusion, just an illusion
Illusion, just an illusion...
I see it on the TV, it's playing on my mind
Everything I see has got something to do with killing my brother
Just another mind game? Or maybe it's a sign
When the child with a gun holds it up to the head of his brother

Well that ain't nice, gotta get a grip, gotta get a hold on life
Gotta get a grip cause you're gonna slip, yeah

Somebody tell me, where did we lose?
Where's the point that we lost the control to live with each other?
Mister politician, searching for a lie
What's the truth? Will the youth find the proof for a revolution?

Cause that ain't nice, gotta get a grip, gotta get a hold on life
Gotta get a grip cause you're gonna slip, on ice
Gotta get a grip, gotta get a hold on life
Gotta get a grip cause you're gonna slip

Gotta get a hold of the situation, gotta get you into my life
Gotta get a hold and get it moving
I can't tell you what you need to know it's up to you, oh yeah
That ain't nice, gotta get a grip, gotta get a hold on life
Gotta get a grip, cause you're gonna slip, on ice
Gotta get a grip, gotta get a hold on life
Gotta get a grip cause you're gonna slip

Gotta get a hold of the situation, gotta get a hold on life
Gotta get a grip and get it moving
I can't tell you what you need to know, it's up to you, oh yeah

Don't your blood run cold, don't the sorrow show
Hold on tight to what you have
See it in your eyes, don't it make you cry
Get a grip and shake the can
Get a grip, yeah, get a grip, yeah, get a grip, yeah
Get a grip, get a grip, get a grip, get a grip, get a hold
Get a grip on life, get a grip on life, get a grip on life
Yeah get a grip
How many tears must we cry before learning
Things that we have they're for real and we're losing
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away

Why do you believe that we've got something coming
You took it all, left me standing here with nothing
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away
Too fae away

In your world you must be dreaming, if you think you can survive
Taking all and giving nothing that's a crime
What makes you something special, what about me, I'm here too
You don't care what I'm feeling and that's the truth
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away

All I need is understanding and the right to survive
Only you could see the warnings, and pass them by
What makes you something special, what about me, I'm here too
You don't care what I'm feeling and that's the truth
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away
Too far away
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away
How many tears must we cry before learning
Things that we had they're for real and we're losing
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away
Too far away, too far away, too far away
Is life everything you want to be
Does it give you everything that you need
Does it live up to your expectations
Are you ready for the celebrations

This is not for the weak of mind
Are you sure that you're my kind
Do you want to be part of me
Are you sure that you can really see

Are you chained to a life that you don't want
Is it hard for you to find a way out
Can you live without the love that you need
Are you sure that what you have is so real

This is not for the weak of mind
Are you sure that you're my kind
Do you want to be part of me
Are you sure that you can really see

All of your life, they try to take your cover
Turn you into another, and make you change your name
When you fall, it's up to you to recover
You can't depend on another, to help you with the pain, yeah
I'm shaking off the chains
I'm shaking off the chains

This is not for the weak of mind
Are you sure that you're my kind
Do you want to be part of me
Are you sure that you can really see

In the night, you say that are falling
People always calling, calling out your name
What do you know, a face appears at the window
Tapping on that window, the window of your soul

I'm shaking off the chains, I'm tired of all the pain
I'm shaking off the chains, let me live again
Shaking off the chains, shaking off the chains

So you lie awake and think about tomorrow
And you try to justify the things you've done
But there's no one here, to hear your tears falling
When you turn around, you find out, that you're the lonely one

And it feels like someone's treading on your shadow
And you always thought that Heaven knows for sure
And it feels like you're drowning, in your tears

So I won't cry for you, no I ain't gonna cry for you
And I ain't gonna lie for you, no I ain't gonna cry for you
Ain't gonna cry for you

So you lie awake and think about the sorrow
Does it really still the fears in your mind
And you try to realise the things you wanted
But you take it all for granted and now it makes you blind

And it feels like someone's treading on your shadow
And you always thought that Heaven knows for sure
And it feels like you're drowning, in your tears
So I ain't gonna cry for you, no I ain't gonna die for you
And I ain't gonna lie for you, no I ain't gonna cry for you
Ain't gonna cry

I ain't gonna cry for you, I ain't gonna cry

So I ain't gonna cry for you, no I ain't gonna die for you
No I ain't gonna lie for you, no I ain't gonna cry for you
Ain't gonna cry, ain't gonna cry for you no more
Ain't gonna die, I ain't gonna die for you no more
Ain't gonna lie, I ain't gonna lie for you no more
Ain't gonna cry, I ain't gonna cry for you no more
Step back and look at you
And tell me that is what you want to be
You realise that what you're seeing is a replica from me

Inside my world is pretty grim that even I can't survive
And I wouldn't try cause I know you

Deep inside you know you're guilty as Hell
Deep inside you know you're guilty as Hell

You realise that what you see is just a replica of me
Only me

It makes no difference if you're the only one
It doesn't matter when all is said and done
Gonna feel the same
God will put the blame on you
Oh yeah

If I was you, if I was you, I'd wanna see
I'd wanna see inside my head
I'd wanna know if I was fucking dead
I'd wanna know what's going on
Someone tell me the truth
There's no fear in a fallen Angel
There's no love in a heart made of stone
There's no truth in a heart that is screaming
Deep inside you're as guilty as Hell
There's no fear in a fallen Angel
There's no love in a heart made of stone
There's no truth in a heart that is screaming
Deep inside you're as guilty as Hell
Got no time to be on the run
Got no holes in my shoes
You're the reason all my friends have gone
But I won't run from you

So many promises, and you broke them all
Oh I'll forgive, but I can't forget
You know you're a fake, but I just can't take no more
Cause I'm tired of it

I'm so tired, so tired
Sick and tired of it all
I'm so tired, sick and tired
I'm so tired, sick and tired of it all, yeah

You turn the truth, then you turn your back
You're a victim of yourself
The hate remains, the hurting still exists
I'm so tired of it all

I'm so tired, sick and tired
So damn tired, sick and tired of it all, oh yeah
I'm so tired, I'm sick and tired of it all
They say you came from heaven but I know that's not the truth
Cause I don't think an Angel could look anything like you
Your eyes are made from sapphires and your heart is made from stone
You gotta be the closest thing to hate I've ever known
And if I didn't know better I'd say you had come alone to the party
Oh yeah

The light is always shining, but you swear that it's gone black
The tide is always turning, but you're never looking back
If I didn't know better I'd say times were pretty bad

Because Rusty Angels they can't fly
Rusty Angels gonna die, yeah
Rusty Angels they can't fly
Rusty Angels gonna die, gonna die

The gifts you bring are fire, and your dreams they turned to dust
Your flying days are over, and your wings have turned to rust
If I didn't know better, I'd say all you had is lost

Because Rusty Angels they can't fly
Rusty Angels gonna die, yeah
Rusty Angels they can't fly
Rusty Angels gonna die, gonna die
If you swallow just a little pride, you might find a little love inside
Open up and let somebody in, 'cause if you need somebody
You know it's not a sin

Rusty Angels they can't fly, Rusty Angels gonna die, yeah
Rusty Angels they can't fly, no, Rusty Angels gonna die
Gonna die, yeah, you can't fly, oh no
Gonna die, oh yeah, you can't fly, oh no
If I had to live again, I'd change everything
'Cause everything I do, you know that I can't win
You say it isn't right, but you say it isn't wrong
How the Hell am I supposed to please everyone

Tell me what it is that I'm supposed to do
I ain't here for everybody, but I ain't here for you
You said it isn't right, but you said it isn't wrong
I wish somebody could tell me, what it is that I've done wrong

The best things in life aren't given, these things ain't for you and me
Every time you shout Forbidden, makes me wonder what you see
The best things in life aren't given, these things ain't for you and me
Every time you shout Forbidden, makes me wonder what you see

You know it's gonna get you now, and you know it starts to bring you down

Tell me what it is that I'm supposed to do
I ain't here for everybody, but I ain't here for you
It seems I have to fight, for all the things I want
Wish somebody could tell me what it is that I've done wrong
The best things in life aren't given, these things ain't for you and me
Every time you shout Forbidden, makes me wonder what you see
The best things in life aren't given, these things ain't for you and me
Every time you shout Forbidden, makes me wonder what you see

It's Forbidden

The best things in life aren't given, these things ain't for you and me
Every time you shout Forbidden, makes me wonder what you see
The best things in life aren't given, these things ain't for you and me
Every time you shout Forbidden, makes me wonder what you see
Makes me wonder what you see
INTRO: (Instrumental: Matthewman)

[Verse I: Sade]:

Haunt me in my dreams
If you please
Your breath is with me now
And always
It's like a breeze

[Chorus: Sade]

So, should you ever doubt me
If it's help that you need
Never dare to doubt me

[Instrumental: Matthewman]

[Verse II: Sade]:

And if you want to sleep
I'll be quiet
Like an angel (like an angel)
As quiet as your soul could be
If you only knew
You had a friend like me...

[Chorus: Sade]

So, should you ever doubt me
If it's help that you need
Never dare to doubt me

[Instrumental: Matthewman]

[Verse 1]
Some saw the sun
Some saw the smoke
Some heard the gun
Some bent the bow
Sometimes the wire must tense for the note
Caught in the fire, say "oh"
We're about to explode

[Chorus]
Carry your world
I'll carry your world
Carry your world
I'll carry your world

[Verse 2]
Some far away
Some search for gold
Some dragon to slay
Heaven we hope is just up the road
Show me the way, Lord
'Cause I, I'm about to explode

[Chorus]
Carry your world
I'll carry your world
Carry your world
I'll carry your world

[Outro]
Carry your world, and all your hurt
(Carry your world)

[Hook]
Come on let’s go
Ain’t nobody gonna get in my way
No, no, no, no
I’m gonna make it, no matter what you say
Alright, alright
I’m flying by you better stay in your lane
It’s on tonight
Ain’t nobody gonna get in my way

[Verse 1]
Set free, out of jail
I’m tired of living in my own hell
I can see a life beyond this cell
No steel can hold me in call the guards and let the sirens ring
Working hard like there’s a gun in my back
I be battin’ one thousand with a weight on my bat

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Can’t censor me
This fire is wild
It’s burning free
It’s meant to be
Inventing my own reality
Come on and set it loose
Let it go and dream this dream with me
Working hard like there’s a gun in my back
I be battin’ one thousand with a weight on my bat

[Hook]

[Bridge]
The ribbon hits my chest
The wind at my back
The feeling of elation running all down my back
My feet hardly hit the ground
I feel I’m walking on clouds
I did it
No fear, no more

[Hook]

[Intro]
Ain't no hat 4 that

[Verse 1]
Some say that your behavior is preposterous
You’re just an imaginary friend
Dangerous to my pursuit of happiness
Trouble’s bound to get me in the end

[Hook]
You got your cure for anxious
You got your pill for bad
But your fancy shoes and handbag
Can’t help you when you’re sad
Cause There ain’t no hat for that
Ain’t no hat for that
There ain’t no hat for that
Ain’t no hat for that

[Verse 2]
Some say her temperament’s obstreperous
She’s only nice when something is at stake
And speaking for her friends there is a cost to us
We pay the price for riding in that wake

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Shopping for your superficial treasures
Stopping short of offering your heart
Stranger to the simplest of pleasures
Distance is to you a work of art

[Hook x3]

[Outro]
Ain’t no hat for that
Ain’t no hat for that
There ain’t no hat for that
Ain’t no hat for that

[Verse 1]
The midnight hour approaches
The killing chill takes over him
His victims will not know when he appears
The lust of deaths possession
Will over take his psycho mind
He won't be happy till he smells their fear

[Chorus]
(He's the angel of death, angel of death)
Psycho Man, Psycho Man
(He's the angel of death, angel of death)
Looking for a victim wherever he can
Psycho Man, Psycho Man
He's the killer

[Verse 2]
Addicted to the madness
The taste of death that lives within
He loves it when he takes their final breath
Stalking gives him pleasure
Killing is the final act
He takes no pity with his lust for death

[Chorus]
(He's the angel of death, angel of death)
Psycho Man, Psycho Man
(He's the angel of death, angel of death)
Looking for a victim wherever he can
Psycho Man, Psycho Man
He's the killer

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Playing in his twilight zone
He knows that he's the best
Creeping through the streets alone
Till he finds his victims next
Killing gives him pleasure
Sleeping gives him pain
The only time he's feeling good
Is when he's killed and killed again
When he's killed again
When he's killed again
When he's killed again
When he's killed again
When he's killed again
When he's killed again
Watch out!

[Chorus]
He's the angel of death, angel of death
He's the angel of death, angel of death
Psycho Man, Psycho Man
Looking for a victim wherever he can
Psycho Man, Psycho Man
He's the killer
He's the killer

[Verse 1]
Man of madness
Who lives in my head
Keeping me awake at night, he sits on my bed
He drives me crazy he won't go away
Playing his game every night and every day, yeah

[Verse 2]
My mind feels heavy
My body feels weak
Suicidal thoughts crying out for some sleep
Impending doom is what I'm about
Think I'm going out without a shadow of doubt

[Chorus]
I search for serenity yeah
Is it really out there?
I don't read the holy books 'cause
They take me nowhere
I can't hold on; yes, I'm
Losing control
I'm paying the price now for
Selling my soul, selling my soul

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I search for serenity, yeah
Is it really out there?
I don't read the holy books cause
They take me nowhere
I can't hold on yes I'm losing control
I'm paying the price now for
Selling my soul, selling my soul

[Outro]
Yeah, for selling my soul
Yeah, selling my soul
Yeah, for selling my soul

[Verse 1]
Guess we're all running out of time
So live your own life and let me live mine
To each their own to question why
We're all just links that forge the chain of life

[Chorus 1]
But who am I to interfere
Think for yourself and keep your conscience really clear

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Learn from each other, so they say
But no one listens to them anyway
Inactive factions stir in time
Procrastination at the scene of crime

[Chorus 2]
There's no return, no guarantee
Accept the term and let your fate be free, be free

[Bridge]
You gotta let yourself see
And let your feelings go free
Accept your own ability
Don't want to end up like me

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
A dynasty of doubt and hate
Religion, politics, self-mutilate
The privilege of being here
All born from nothing 'til we disappear

[Chorus 2]
There's no return, no guarantee
Accept the term and let your fate be free, you're free
One fine day in Hell
The master told a story
Someone lied so well
He sent him back to Glory

There are whispers between the screams
That this deed can be done
Even sinners must dream
And I can be the one to make the Devil cry

I can win this game
If all things come together
I know this sounds quite strange
I won't be smart, just clever

It's the law on the other side
Just the kill lets you run
And how many have tried?
I know I'll be the one to make the Devil cry

At last my time has come
I must not give him pleasure
I can be the one
One chance or burn forever
So I told him about my pain
And the life I've been through
He just smiled and the laughter came
Then I told him that I love you, and the Devil cried

Tears from his eyes
Eyes of fire
And the Devil cried
Oh it's night again
And the dark just killed the sun
If the light must end
You've got time to run away

There's a door to dreams
And it always lets you in
But with a silent scream
All the nightmares must begin

Still you chase what you can't see
Like death and pain and sin
And the Shadow of The Wind
The Shadow of The Wind

You'll remember me
I could make you disappear
Be where you want to be
Just as long as it's not here

Well I'm back and stronger
And the first one's always free
And it lasts much longer
You can bet your sanity
Never more the victim cries
As I slip beneath the skin
Like the Shadow of The Wind
The Shadow of The Wind

If words had names like red and green
And two for sympathy
Black and white and in between
Then you'd be misery

Every day is an inquisition
Who are you? What are you? Why?
I'm alive, I belong, I'll be back
It's a half truth, still a whole lie

In the garden of good and evil
You'll come, but you know
The spider only spins
The Shadow of The Wind
The Shadow of The Wind
Hello can you hear me
I might not be alone
Don't see anyone near me
But I just might go home again
Lets meet in the morning
I just can't speak tonight
This is more than a warning
Be silent till its light and then

You know I'll be there
Waiting for someone to believe me
Remembering it all
Make my flesh start to crawl
I've seen an ear in the wall

This time it could prove it
But you've heard this all before
Cry wolf and you're moving
To a special kind of danger zone
I need a witness
Somebody just like you
So bring an exorcist
A wizard and the Holy Ghost
You know I'll be there
Waiting for someone to believe me
Remembering it all
Make my flesh creep and crawl
I've seen an ear in the wall

One more reason one more time
Someone's searching through my mind
Now where am I suppose to go
Its not who you are its who you know
What's it gonna be
I knew you would answer
I'm the curiosity
You could miss a chance because
The fool might see reality
There it is in the corner
You must be going blind
What's wrong were you born before
Your god invented eyes
It's got to be there
Grinding away at my secrets
It's going so dark
And you can't see it all
I'll turn on some lights
So you're sure not to fall
It's next to the eye in the wall
Zaytoven
Zaytoven on the track
Gucci!

They call me Chef Boy R-D
But hold that thought
It's a Kodak moment
The way I hold that fork
Hurricane wrist game
Turn that junk off
Pockets Piggly Wiggly
Can't Kermit The Frog dawg

Early in the mornin' I ain't even yawnin'
I'm cookin' up a cake like I'm doin' a performance
When it comes to flossin' I ain't even talkin
Davins on my dunk got my Chevy moonwalkin'

[Verse 1]
You were the freak king of the piercing shop
All the girls thought they could sing
But they're really not shit, I don't get it
You're looking like a man, you're talking like a baby
How the fuck is your song in a Coke commercial? Crazy
I don't get it, your taste once exquisite

[Chorus]
What happened to Brooklyn?
What happened to New York?
What happened to my scene?
What happened to punk rock, rock?

[Verse 2]
You called me the queen of the downtown scene, babe
How the fuck would you go switch it up and then replace me?
I don't get it, I'm so legit

[Chorus 2]
Tell me, was it 'cause I wasn't platinum in jewels?
That perhaps, you thought I was a little bit of an uncool
Kid, was that it?

[Bridge]
Stefani, you suck, I know you're selling twenty million
Wish they could have seen you when we booed you off in Williamsburg
You're hurt, I know my words don't hurt ya

[Breakdown]
Oh, girl, I see you walking 'round in your pearls
Thinking that you’re number one
You’re so funny, 'cause honey, you're not

[Chorus 3]
What happened to Brooklyn, the last frontier?
They said you could make it anywhere if you can make it here
But where?
No magic in the air

[Chorus 4]
What happened to Brooklyn?
What happened to our scene, baby?
Have we all gone Gaga crazy?
Remember when the streets used to be dangerous
And we were born bad?
And we were born bad?

[Outro]
Punk rock, punk rock
The boys used to punch each other in the face
And girls were walking 'round wasted
Everyone had a good night, come back in sunlight
Punk rock, rock, rock

This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear

This is my December
This is my snow-covered home
This is my December
This is me, alone

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed

To make you feel like that
(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
(And I) Take back all the things
That I said to you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And I'd give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
This is my December
These are my snow-covered trees
This is me pretending
This is all I need

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed

To make you feel like that

Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to

[Verse 1:]
Play your part, love
Shawty wanted to be a dancer
I whipped out the camera
And said fuck the small talk, sugar
(Fuck the small talk)
Body moving to the break beat
Dirty dancing to the JBs

[Hook:]
Baby girl you better not dance with none of these other niggas
The way you dance with me

[Verse 2:]
Shoulda seen her
I don't want to let her go too soon
(Too soon)
But I'll be damned if I spent all this loot on you
It's true
Hard work in a small place.
(Small place)
Hundred dollars make it all change

[Chorus:]
Baby girl, you better not dance with none of these other niggas

Go, go, go
(I don't want to go)
Go, go, go
(I don't want to go)
Go, go, go
(I don't want to go)
Pretty pigtail, big hips, big lips
Far from a pig in the cell, your figure on hit
Freaky figs coming from a tree
Get a pick, get in place while you can
Get a taste for the lick
Honey, honey, honey flowing down your dress
I live in your nest
Stay doing what's best for the team
Putting in reps while putting in wraps
You taking them shots to the chest my seed
My seed, My seed

[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl

[Verse 1]
I could escape this feeling with my China Girl
I feel a wreck without my little China Girl
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder
Saw the stars crashing

[Verse 2]
I'm a mess without my little China Girl
Wake up in the mornings, where's my little China Girl?
I hear her hearts beating loud as thunder
I saw the stars crashing down

[Chorus 1]
I'm feeling tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China Girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China Girl

[Verse 3]
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head, plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes

[Bridge]
My little china girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
You know, I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world

[Chorus 2]
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby, just you shut your mouth
She says... shh
She says... shh
She says...

[Chorus 2]
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby, just you shut your mouth
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby, just you shut your mouth
She says... shh
She says...

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl

[Hook]
Papa was a rolling stone
But I want to be the cover of a Rolling Stone
Only I know that I can’t do it alone
Only I know that I can’t do it alone

[Verse 1]
August 6th, 1981 I took my first breath
They said I smiled and cried ‘til it was none left
I guess I knew what I was in for before hand
Miniature grown man HAH
Third of three sons big bird and squirt guns
Aunt Tammy dressed up like a clown when I turned one
Scared the shit out of me but thanks for trying
Sitting in my high chair throw a kick and crying
I remember everything every single detail
Clinging onto daddies leg like, “Don’t leave, I’ll be good
I promise, I’ll do anything Dad, honest.”
But he had to go to work and bust his ass for them dollars
Now it all makes sense back then I wasn't having it
Obsessed with He-man so young and so adamant
More concerned with Castle Grayskull than baseball
Then I learned that if I worked a little I could have it all
All my friends got allowances I had a paper route
And when no one was looking I threw the papers out
Got caught made Dad furious
And if you gonna do something do it right
That’s what earnest is

[Hook]
Papa was a rolling stone
But I want to be the cover of a Rolling Stone
Only I know that I can’t do it alone
Only I know that I can’t do it alone

[Verse 2]
Papa was a rolling stone
Working hard while I’m home alone on some macaulay culkin shit
So bit little man had to plan follow through with it
But mom’s was so inconsiderate
Illiterate? Nope I read the dictionary daily
Gift the gab of rap and set sail and
Step-moms brought the pooping to the stick, nothing new to me
Don’t act like you my momma ‘cause my dad bought you some jewelry
Oh that sounds cool to read
I sat back and watched pops play the ladies like chess checkmate
6 siblings 3 different moms can you imagine
Simply seeing your paycheck broken down to fractions
Papa was a pimp married 4 times
Indecisive tried to strike a gold mine
Sifting through the sand something like a 49
And up to the point where my chest become a cold mine
But when they come and go I’ll be here to the bitter end pop just letting you know
I never understood temptation I guess we both got a little David Ruffin in us
Everybody sing it with us now

[Hook]
Papa was a rolling stone
But I want to be the cover of a Rolling Stone
Only I know that I can’t do it alone
Only I know that I can’t do it alone
Papa was a rolling stone
But I want to be the cover of a Rolling Stone
Only I know that I can’t do it alone
Only I know that I can’t do it alone
Versace Versace I'll play the piano I'm not Liberace
You could stay seated I'm taking that Grammy your music is sloppy
Niggas is heated they keep on repeating the evening in slow-mo
I sold enough records I'm selling out cities, I don't do no promo
Marina Abramovic Riccardo Tisci Madonna Beyonce
And Donatella if you don't believe me believe what the blogs say
We was all at the table, it was a debate then we came in agreement
That twitter ain't relevant anyway really, I'm finna delete it
My Instagram all over internet anyway, don't think I need it
SKRRRR
Got bimmers on bimmers on bimmers
On bimmers on bimmers on bimmers
I'm running that Porsche for the winter
If you trying to follow the leader
I need a sabbatical do an apprenticeship under Domingo
Study Carreras and Luci, I ain't finna rush out a single
I get it when artists go loopy and lose it and get into opiates
Like when you get all that you wanted and that shit is not what you hoped it was
You had you a formula, one hit the wall now you Ayrton Senna
You had you a lady, then she hurt your ego, now you can't forgive her
Yea
I'm wearing some Dickies they cost 30 Euro
I'm not even into Versace
People to people, party to place
Having the time of your life is all on your face
Hands in the sky, while snatch and catch in the vibe
We go uptown, downtown, that’s how we ride!

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Get your strip mode, it’s where we…
It’s the top dough, the top… for driving the trash
Let, let the bass move, let it go!
(Let, let the bass move, let it go)
Bass, bass, move, let it go
Bass, bass, move, let it go
Bass, bass, move, let it go
Bass, bass, move, let it go

Now I’ve seen players, too many to name
Some gain recognition and even fame
Some go slow and some may go fast
But me and my partners we dip and we dash
Every flipping the cash, rip zipping the bag
Should be slip when it crash, all good never bad
All you never had, dreams do come true
For me and you, so let it do what it do!
Boy, let me say, it’s the ride of your life
And if you’re rolling with me
I tell you, I’ll do you right
So put your seat belt on, and let your hair…
And if you… then I suggest you let it go!

People to people, party to place
Having the time of your life is all on your face
Hands in the sky, while snatch and catch in the vibe
We go uptown, downtown, that’s how we ride!

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Get your strip mode, it’s where we…

Bass, bass, move, let it go
Bass, bass, move, let it go
Bass, bass, move, let it go

Ride, ride, roll it, roll it, tip it, advance it
Turn it, burn it, take it, adjust it!
We can bounce and ball, just tell me how you play
I never give up, I do this thing like everyday
And I break it down in her way
Oh man, I got carried away
But anyway I’mma say I feel good everyday!
Every way, ta, ta, ta
I’ll make the beat go pa pa pa... the heat, stop the beat
Listen, attention, permission
Cause this is grand thing bang, bang
Same range, change…
Playing games, get you with you, flick it up!
I slip... can’t get with us No matter what!
It’s better up It’s better not
That’s what they ask
Come out the grass, so do it fast!
People to people, party to place
Having the time of your life is all on your face
Hands in the sky, while snatch and catch in the vibe
We go uptown, downtown, that’s how we ride!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I was in high school
Met this little bad bitch
She had all the Jordan shoes
Hair in a ponytail
Earrings bamboo
I said no disrespect
Girl I want a sample
She said, “You don’t know me yet”
I said, “What that got to do with it”
One week or nine months I’m still gon’ hit it
Now admit it, you’re tempted, temptation is a motherfucker
Now let your guard down
I just wanna fuck you
I’m hard right now
I put that on me
She giggled and said, “I’m full of curiosity"
Well you know curiosity killed the cat
So as we walk home from school show me where you live at
Walked in, put the rubber on, then I killed that
Walked out, she hopped on the phone, girl he did that
Hm hm
Her friend on the other end thinking how she gonna get a piece of him
Preach

[Hook]
When I get up all in ya

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Yeah, it’s Ab-Soul
Used to fuck on my momma’s sofa
Them were the good old days but now a nigga older
I think back of when I chased that cat
Like a horny dog, nigga wet dreams and all
Waking up in cold sweat thinking bout them hoes, y’all
No holds barred I would go so hard
Sending bitches notes in class so much I hardly passed
Hoping she give me the mule yeah throw me that ass
I made her laugh
Maybe walk her home
Maybe get some dome
Like Super Bowl Sunday
And then I’m gone
Off to the next
Call her on the phone
This was before text
Carson High we was on them chicks”
Let them play the good role then we make them cake mix
That’s a flip if you didn’t know
Let the homie hit though
Then she tell her girlfriend, then we let her join in

[Outro]

Nicki Minaj...I'm at MTV. I wanna be honest with you. I love you. I like you. I want you. I want you to be mine.

I'm here at MTV because, this is a worldwide network, and the reason why I'm not telling you this face to face is I understand that you're busy. I'mma be honest with you. I wanna marry you. I'm here today at MTV. Nicki Minaj, will you marry me?

We got the same symptoms: We both suffer from success. You're out there touring, you're out there hustling, you're out there making music, and you're out there winning. I understand.

That's why I feel like you need a man like me in your life. That's gonna take care of you and respect you. You gotta take your time and think about it, I overstand. But I know I'd have to be here today to let you know how serious I am and how serious this is to me.

I wanna let your fans know, my fans know, my family, your family... that I wanna marry you. I've been working hard to get this ring. I would've proposed to you last year. That 'Take it to the head' video. I wanted to tell you... but, you know... things got better for me. I prepared for this day!

So I went and got this ring. Nicki Minaj, will you marry me?

[Tommy Mara]
Now the rules of the family has nothing to do with the outside world
The outside world don't count here this is an inner circle of our family
What we say goes
Anybody anyplace else that disrespects you deal with us
If you're with us you're with us, and that's it
That's the way it goes, Are you listeninin to me?
That's the way it goes, there's no such thing
As an outsider comming in, we don't let no one in
We use all of them to do our dirty work
And they come in they do our dirty work and that's just the way it is
Your Family is your life that's what it is life and death

[Intro]
So...let's do Orange Colored Sky
Yeah?
I used to sing this at the Oak Room with my buddies
Woo! It's getting windy

[Verse 1]
I was walking along, minding my business
When out of the orange colored sky
Flash, bam, alakazam
Wonderful you came by
I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine
When out of that orange colored view
Wham, bam, alakazam
I got a look at you

[Chorus]
Oh, one look and I yelled, "Timber!"
Watch out for flying glass
‘Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
I've been hit
This is it, this is it

[Verse 2]
I was walking along, minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Wham, bam, alakazam
Out of the orange colored sky

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, one look and I yelled, "Timber!"
Watch out for flying glass
'Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
I've been hit
This is it, this is it

[Verse 3]
I was walking along, minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Wham, bam, alakazam
Out of the orange colored, purple striped, pretty green polkadot sky
Wham, bam, alakazam
And gone, bye
Goodbye

[Verse 1]
I'm dreamin' of a white Christmas
Just like the one I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen to hear sleigh bells in the snow
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm dreamin' of a white, white, white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
Oh, may your days be so very merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Interlude]
So as you can tell, I'm very outgoing
And a little bit shy, but I decided that this song is just too short
It's such a beautiful Christmas song, but it's only one verse
So I added one extra one, here it goes

[Verse 2]
I'm dreamin' of a white snowman
With a carrot nose and charcoal eyes
Oh, and when he cries, I'm gonna tell him it's okay
Because Santa's on his sleigh and he's on his way
Oh-oh-oh, I'm, I'm dreamin' of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
Oh, may all your days and your Thanksgivings be so bright
And may all, all your Christmases be white

[Outro]
Okay, so I suppose it's not very white outside yet

[Intro]
It doesn't matter if you love him
Or capital H-I-M
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby
(Or capital H-I-M)

Baby love yourself

[Verse 1]
My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said: "'Cause he made you perfect, babe"
"So hold your head up girl and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say"

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way
Born this way

[Post-Chorus]
(Don't hide yourself-) 

[?]
I was born-
Don't hide yourself-
Just love yourself-

[Interlude]
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be!

[Breakdown]
It doesn't matter if you love him
Or capital H-I-M
I born this way

[Verse 2]
Give yourself prudence
And love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital H-I-M
I love my life I love this record and
Mi amore vole fe yah (same DNA)

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way

[Post-Chorus]
I'm beautiful-
'Cause God makes no-
I'm on the right-

One glance from your eyes, and I'm captivated
The taste of your skin
The warmth of your hungry lips
Has me so taken, and I...

[Chorus 1]
Love the way you can make me dance from miles away
When I'm with you, I'm so sedated
I'm captivated by you

[Verse 2]
You're just like the wind
'Cause everything moves away when you're around it
The sun is just like the sound of your voice in the morning
When you light my world up, and I...

[Chorus 2]
Love the way you can make me dance from miles away
When I'm with you, I'm never jaded
I'm captivated

[Bridge]
Oh, I'll never stop believing in this crazy love we're leading
Oh, sugar, hold me closer and make me sweeter
I need you
I love you

[Breakdown]
So, please, show me that smile
Make me laugh for just a little while
Then breathe me one breath
I only need one to fill the emptiness, and I...

[Chorus 3]
Love the way you can make me dance from miles away
It's been so long, but now I've waited
And I'm captivated

[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh

I need somebody who calls my name
When clouds are smokin up my way
You get me through these cha-changing skies
I don't wanna be afraid again
It's just that I could use a friend
You get me through these cha-changing skies

[Pre-Chorus]
Give me something that I can wrestle to the ground
There isn't anything that I can't handle now-iow
Believe me when I say that I will be okay
And listen, there's some voice and my cha-changing skies

I wanna dance right through the night
You get me through these cha-changing skies
Know that I am not emotional
It's just that I don't wanna fall without my parachute, tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Give me something that I can wrestle to the ground
There isn't anything that I can't handle now-iow
Believe me when I say that I will be okay
And listen, there's some voice and my cha-changing skies

[Chorus]
Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing

Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace

But I'm not the only one
I hope someday that you'll join us
And the world will live as one

People of the nation
Are you listening?
It isn't equal if it's sometimes
I want a real democracy
Imagine all the people
Could love equally

[Verse 4]
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger, oh yeah
Just the brotherhood of man

[Verse 5]
Imagine all the people sharing in the world
With nothing to hate, and nothing to think
Just people to love, and friends to have drinks

[Chorus]
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday that you'll join us
Oh-oh, yeah
And the world will live as one

I don't know why you' hurt, inside
Or what was said to make, you, cry
I hope that you can see you are the greatest thing to me
And when, you' feeling like you're not enough
I'll give you wings, I'll lift you up
I hope that you can see you are the greatest, greatest thing to me

[Verse 1]
It's been a hard day
Harder night
The rockstar's girlfriend
She lost the fight
Well, it’s alright, baby, I'm nobody’s mother
When you don't want the last cigerette to be over

[Chorus]
You fooled me again
Fooled me again with your honest, honest, honest eyes
Again, fooled me again with your dirty mouth full of honest lies
Again, oh, and you fool me again, oh yeah
You're so honest
Full of honest eyes

[Verse 2]
It’s been two days since he left home
She dried her eyes
Picked up her microphone
She sang, "It’s alright, baby."
I'm nobody’s mother
But I dont want this last cigerette to be over

[Chorus]
You fooled me again
Fooled me again with your honest, honest, honest eyes
Again, fooled me again with your dirty mouth full of honest lies
Again, oh, and you fool me again, oh yeah
You're so honest
Full of honest eyes

[Instrumental Bridge]

You're so full of it
At least your shh... honest
Eyes

[Verse 1]
I can’t help myself
I'm in love
And when I get back from outer space
I'm gonna punch him in his face
He's one
He's a bad, bad boy
Got me twisted, uh
If he's the moon, then I'm eclipsed
I'm so lunar, yeah
When I get to him, run him over with my rocket ship

[Pre-Chorus 1]
My eyeliner runs in constellations for you, dear
If only I could reboot my mechanical heart, I'd think clear

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm feeling so out of this world
Baby, with you I'm a different girl
Oh-oh-oh, you're my future love
Baby, could we make a home in the stars?
Baby, somewhere in a galaxy far
Oh-oh-oh, you're my future love

[Post-Chorus]
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-fu-future love?
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-future man?
I want to fu-fuck you as hard as I can
Would you put me in your fu-future plans?
I want a fu-fu-fu-future man

[Verse 2]
I've been working and engineering, uh
All our chemistries and our situations
Working out our sex equations
And I know I'm no Nostradamus, yeah
When my hair is blond but my heart's brunette
If I'm not on him then at least I'm honest

[Pre-Chorus 2]
My mascara runs in constellations for you dear, my dear
If only I could space my brain for a minute
I'd think clear

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm feeling so out of this world
Baby, with you I'm a different girl
Oh-oh-oh, you're my future love
Baby, could we make a home in the stars?
Baby, somewhere in a galaxy far
Oh-oh-oh, you're my future love

[Post-Chorus]
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-fu-future love?
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-future man?
I want to fu-fuck you as hard as I can
Would you put me in your fu-future plans?
I want a fu-fu-fu-future man

[Bridge]
Fuel me up, and take me into a place we've never been
He is so unreal
He's a mannequin
A synthetic, plastic, rubber man
And I'm relying on, on a shooting star
To get to you my future love, ah-ah
He's my rubber hunk, my mechanic guy
And I'm stuck in his metal rubber eyes
Rubber eyes
My future guy

[Outro]
Huh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh

[Verse 1]
My insides all turned to ash, so slow
And blew away as I collapsed, so cold
A black wind took them away from sight
And held the darkness over day, that night

And the clouds above move closer
Looking so dissatisfied
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing

[Verse 2]
I used to be my own protection, but not now
'Cause my path has lost direction, somehow
A black wind took you away from sight
And held the darkness over day, that night

And the clouds above move closer
Looking so dissatisfied
And the ground below grew colder
As they put you down inside
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing

[Pre-Chorus]
So now, you're gone and I was wrong
I never knew what it was like to be alone

[Chorus]
On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day
On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day
On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day
(I used to be my own protection, but not now)
On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day
('Cause my mind has lost direction, somehow)
On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day
(I used to be my own protection, but not now)
On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day
('Cause my mind has lost direction, somehow)

[Verse 1]
I've got no friends
I'm my own queen
But I'm living on, living on the radio, that's my dream
Stone river eyes, and a lonely heart
If I'm living on the radio, they won't tear me apart

[Verse 2]
10 stems and roses on a tree
10 steps, and lonely nights, but you still got me
On the road, road paved in gold

[Chorus]
Baby you must believe
Baby you must be free
Keep living on, living on the radio, that's your dream
Baby you've got a friend
And so many little monsters, yeah
Keep living on, living on the radio

[Verse 3]
And when there's nowhere to go
And all your friends are gone
And you've only got your daddy to call
You can be all right honey
'Cause your songs are on the radio

[Verse 4]
'Cause you're sure to miss all the caviar
The champagne, and the sold-out shows
But we'll be all right honey
'Cause your songs are on the radio

[Intro]
(Happy Ending...)

[Verse 1]
I saw a shadow, and I knew that it wasn't mine
You and her, I know that you were intertwined
Even though her clothes were on and everything
Your eyes were somewhere else, and you were both to blame

[Verse 2]
Don't say a word
I'm sure that it won't be enough to erase what I know
Just happens now, what dreams are made of
This is my house, and I won't allow the disrespect
Baby, don't look at me like that, I don't belong to you, no way

[Chorus]
'Cause baby now that you're caught what am I supposed to say
When you're so wrong in what you did but I still feel this way
I can't believe it or forget it, what I saw today
And if you're wondering if I'm staying, answer is no way
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it)
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it, babe)
No way-ay-ay-ay

[Verse 3]
Thought that I saw something I know did not belong to me
But then I thought that there's no way you would do that to me
And then last week, when you went aside to use your phone
I felt a chill but told myself that it was from the cold

[Verse 4]
And I just woke up, but I wish that it was a nightmare
'Cause when I have those, it isn't real like this one is
This is my heart, and I won't allow the disrespect
Baby, don't look at me like that, I don't belong to you, no way

[Chorus]
'Cause baby now that you're caught what am I supposed to say
When you're so wrong in what you did but I still feel this way
I can't believe it or forget it, what I saw today
And if you're wondering if I'm staying, answer is no way
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it)
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it, babe)
No way-ay-ay-ay

[Bridge]
Get your things and go
You can take the dinner left over from last night
I made you your favorite goodbye

[Chorus]
'Cause baby now that you're caught what am I supposed to say
When you're so wrong in what you did but I still feel this way
I can't believe it or forget it, what I saw today
And if you're wondering if I'm staying, answer is no way
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it)
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it, babe)
No way-ay-ay-ay

[Verse 1]
I'm calling 'cause I need you
You know I need you so desperately
You know how bad I can get
And you know how good I can be
I'm calling just to tell you
Get here, I'll make it all worth your while
I can make you some food
Boy, and then I can make you smile

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got nothing on but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight
I've got nothing on but the radio
And I'm tuned into your station tonight
You're with me tonight

[Verse 2]
You better get here soon
O-or you know what I will do
Got too much time on my hands
Wait 'til I get my hands on you

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got nothing on but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight
Nothing, nothing on but the radio
And I'm tuned into your station tonight
You're with me tonight

[Bridge]
When you get here, boy, we can dance
My hands in the back pockets of your pants
I've turned the lights down low
And I've got nothing on but the radio

[Breakdown]
Got too much time on my hands
Wait 'til I get my hands on you

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got nothing on but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight
I've got nothing on but the radio
And I'm tuned into your station tonight
With me tonight (oh-oh, nothing)
Nothing on but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight
Nothing, nothing on but the radio
And I'm tuned into your station tonight
You're with me tonight

[Break]
Wait 'til I get my hands on you (oh-oh, nothing)

[Chorus]
Nothing on but the radio
And I've got nothing on for tonight
Nothing, nothing on but the radio
And I'm tuned into your station tonight
You're with me tonight

In between the spaces, happiness can trace it down
We're not gonna leave this town

We gon' grab the mics and get 'em off the wall
So everybody in here can stop snoring

I'm not bad, I just sound that way!

[Verse 1]
All the girls, they like their presents like their presents
When boys wrap them up in ribbons, ribbons, ribbons
Doesn't matter if they're precious or expensive if they're well thought out
Sexed up, wrapped right
Every time, get in line, and give me mine
We like black, white, big, striped, polka-dotted, cafe-lotted
Presents come in many sizes
Wrap them up in ribbons

[Chorus]
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up

I'm not a Hallmark card expression
Need material attention
Wrapped in ribbons, Richard Simmons
Silly ribbons, ribbons, ribbons!
If you can't afford the best
Don't be stressed, take a rest
Get a job, do it right
It's my birthday all night
We like black, white, big, striped, famous, super-sized ribbons
Don't care what you put inside them
Wrap it all in ribbons
It's the lifestyle that I like
I'll give you yours, you give me mine
But don't forget to wrap them up in pretty, pretty ribbons

[Chorus]
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up

Oh, oh yeah
Oh, baby

[Verse 1]
Last time I thought we had this talk
Boy, you were getting ready to leave
I thought, baby, you were done
'Cause for a while, you could barely look at me
This time, I thought that we'd be fine
That I'd forget the things that you said
I tried crossing out your words
But baby, you can not forget the past (Oh, oh babe)
Cannot forget the past (Oh, oh)
Still, baby...

[Chorus]
I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love, you see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
The second time around

[Verse 2]
We tried going back to Joe's
That always was our favorite place
Long rides, baby, by the coast
Do you remember where we stayed?
Last time, we were hangin' out
You were acting kind of estranged
Now it's the second time around
I'm sorry, now it's me that feels this way
(My heart just keeps on turning)
It's me that feels this way, babe (Oh, oh babe)
And now you are the one that is hurting

[Chorus]
I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love, you see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around

[Bridge]
I'm not sure the best way to say this
But I can't pretend to love you no more, babe
This ferris wheel's got me crazy
Maybe the second time around is not meant for us, baby
Not meant for us, baby
Hey, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love, you see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love, you see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
The second time around

Hold me, daddy, real tight

I met a drummer last week at a pool bar down
B-by the shore
With a body like that and your stonewashed eyes
I want you more

[Pre-Chorus]
He cried, "Mother, what'd you do to me?"
I said, "Mother, mother, mother's for babies, call me kitty."

[Chorus]
Yeah, shake your kitty
Shake your kitty (meow)
Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me
Shake your kitty
Shake your kitty (meow)

Shake your shake
Shake shake
Shake your sh-shake
Shake it, shake it

I took a drummer by the hand to the jukebox
Then we hit the floor
With your Van Halen pin and your dark side burns
I want you more

He cried, "Mother, what'd you do to me?"
I said, "Mother, mother, mother's for babies, call me kitty."

[Chorus]

Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me
Shake your kitty
Shake your kitty (meow)
Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me

[Bridge]
You never call me by my name, but I still want you
You play some pretty tricky games, but I still want you
Your best friend drives a fancy car, but I still want you
You're working every hour, but, but I still want you, yeah

[Refrain]
If you see a girl this pretty shake her, shake her, shake her kitty
When you see a girl that's pretty shake it, shake it, shake that kitty

[Chorus]
Shake your kitty
Shake your kitty (meow)
Put your arms around me, babe

Shake your kitty
Shake your kitty (meow)

If you see a girl this pretty shake her, shake her, shake her kitty
When you see a girl that's pretty shake it, shake it, shake that kitty

[Outro]
Shake your shake
Shake it, shake
Shake it, shake
Shake it, shake
Meow
Uh, uh-oh

[Verse 1]
Wait, I think it's time
Your fire's lit and so is mine
Go turn out the light
Don't be afraid
Tonight's the night

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I won't, I won't try to change you
But I will, I will if you want me to
Yeah, it always brings me down when you're not around
I still need you

[Chorus]
Oh, you do something for me, baby
And I cannot control it, baby
You do something for me
Oh, you do something crazy to me
And I cannot control it, baby
You do something for me
And I feel so down when you're not around

[Verse 2]
Boy, we're almost there
I'll lay your clothes over my chair
Pull the shades down low
We're both ready to lose control

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I won't, I won't try to tame you
But I will, I will if you want me to
Yeah, it always brings me down when you're not around
I still need you

[Chorus]
Oh, you do something for me, baby
And I cannot control it, baby
You do something for me
Oh, you do something crazy to me
And I cannot control it, baby
You do something for me
And I feel so down when you're not around

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I won't, I won't try to tame you
But I will, I will if you want me to
Yeah, it always brings me down when you're not around
I still need you

[Chorus]
Oh, you do something for me, baby
And I cannot control it lately
You do something for me
Oh, you do something for me baby
And I cannot control it, baby
You do something for me
Oh, you do something crazy to me
And I cannot control it, baby
La la la la la la la la
You always bring me down

[Verse 1]
Last week I saw you out
And I knew we would be a match in Heaven
Just the coolest kind of team

I, I know there ain’t no way that we won’t
'Cause we won’t stop 'til we go, go the distance
We’re a distance
Baby, I believe it

And you know we won’t be defeated
In my heart, I believe it
Yeah, you and me are gonna win it, baby

[Chorus]

We’re gonna show this town what I know we’re about
Shoot it, run it, what’s it called?
Everybody loves it (football)
Shoot it, run it, what’s it called?
Everybody loves it (football)

[Verse 2]
I've got the feeling that this year could be the one
We're gonna tear it up and burn out everyone

[Break]
I’m gonna take you out, take you out, take you out
We’re gonna show this town what I know we’re about

In my heart, I believe it
Yeah, you and me are gonna win it, baby

[Chorus]
I’m gonna take you out, take you out, take you out
We’re gonna show this town what I know we’re about

[Intro]
What if I were to leave you
But then you fell back in love with me?

[Verse]
How could you ever let me go?
How could you ever, ever let me go?
I scream your name across the bar
I carry pictures of your Neil Young guitar, guitar

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I just can't seem to forget you
No, I can't for just as long as I met you
You're my baby
You never made it through to you

[Chorus]
If I was the last girl
And you were the last boy left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake
Last girl, and you were the last boy left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake

[Verse]
How could you ever let me go?
How could you ever, ever let me go?
I scream your name across the bar
I carry pictures of your Neil Young guitar, guitar

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I just can't seem to forget you
No, I can't for just as long as I met you
You're my baby
You never made it through to you

[Chorus]
If I was the last girl
And you were the last boy left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake
Last girl, and you were the last boy left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake

[Chorus]
If I was the last girl
And you were the last boy left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake
Last girl, and you were the last boy left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake

[Verse 1]
Midnight at the glamour show on a Sunday Night
Everybody drink a lot of whiskey and wine
We dance like no tomorrow
We’re on Burlesque time
But everybody’s got to work tomorrow at nine

[Pre-Chorus]
Touch me, t-touch me, baby, but don’t mess up my hair
Love me l-love me crazy, but don’t get too attached
This is a brief affair

[Chorus]
Vanity (pictures in magazines, movie screens)
Vanity (mirrors and cameras, so many beauty queens)
Vanity
It’s so good to be (fabulous and glamorous, we love ourselves and no one else)

[Interlude]
Va-va-va-va-vanity
Va-vanity
Va-va-va-vanity

[Verse 2]
Nothing wrong with being just a little bit vain
We need a little pretty ’cause this country’s insane
So go ahead and label me whatever you like
But nothings quite as sexy as a woman is fine

[Pre-Chorus]
Touch me, t-touch me, baby, but don’t mess up my hair (oh)
Love me l-love me crazy, but don’t get too attached
This is a brief affair

[Chorus]
Vanity (pictures in magazines, movie screens)
Vanity (mirrors and cameras, so many beauty queens)
Vanity
It’s so good to be (fabulous and glamorous, we love ourselves and no one else)

[Bridge]
Look at me
Watcha lookin' at?
Look at me
Watcha starin' at?
Look at me
Watcha lookin' at?
Look at me
Watcha starin' at?

[Verse 3]
I’m coming around
I’m sipping on Andre, it’s time
I heard the cutie's in the back, start in the p-party line
Let’s dance, quick round
We’re in the vanity house
We’re covered in sequins, diamonds
We're happy ’cause we're shining

[Pre-Chorus]
Touch me, t-touch me, baby, but don’t mess up my hair (oh)
Love me l-love me crazy, but don’t get too attached
This is a brief affair

[Chorus]
Vanity (pictures in magazines, movie screens)
Vanity (mirrors and cameras, so many beauty queens)
Vanity
It’s so good to be (fabulous and glamorous, we love ourselves and no one else)
Vanity (pictures in magazines, movie screens)
Vanity (mirrors and cameras, so many beauty queens)
Vanity
It’s so good to be (fabulous and glamorous, we love ourselves and no one else)

[Verse 1]
It's funny how things, they change
The clouds they part
Rearrange for me
Faces of strangers and I have no familiars to help me see

[Pre-Chorus]
Where is home?
I want you to know

[Chorus]
That I wish you were here
I wish you were here

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wonder if God hides out in cities to set us free
'Cause, yeah, this room is crowded, but I am so alone in it
Help me, please

[Pre-Chorus]
Where is home?
I want you to know

[Chorus]
That I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

[Bridge]
And I will be strong
I won't give in
I won't deny you
I know where we've been
I'm so much more than all of my fears
Than all of these tears
My tears, yeah

[Breakdown]
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

[Pre-Chorus]
Where is home?
I want you to know
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
That I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

[Intro]
How could I see you when I was so blind?
How could I grasp you when I was far behind?
How could I hear you when I was so deaf?
How could I get up when I had been left?

[Chorus]
But You said, don't worry
For I've healed the blind man
And I've set the captives free
And You said, don't worry
For all you've gotta do
Is put your trust in me

[Bridge]
How could I be clean when I was so dirty
How could I be made whole when I was torn apart
Make me whole, make me whole
Make me whole again

[Chorus]
But You said, don't worry
For I've healed the blind man
And I've set the captives free
And You said, don't worry
For all you've gotta do
Is put your trust in me
But You said, don't worry
For I've healed the blind man
And I've set the captives free
And You said, don't worry
For all you've gotta do
Is put your trust in me
But You said, don't worry
For I've healed the blind man
And I've set the captives free
And You said, don't worry
For all you've gotta do
Is put your trust in me

[Verse 1]
I won't break down today
Another brick's in my way of shadows
The promises they made
Regret themselves, and say "this is too hard"

[Refrain]
Yeah, they say you grow when you don't succeed
But it's hard to breathe when no one believes in me

[Pre-Chorus]
So let the sound bring me back
Sounds have no regrets
And before you know it

[Chorus]
I'll take your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Right to the stars and beyond
Your words, and be gone
I'll take your words, and be gone

[Verse 2]
Whenever you're afraid, or someone's far away
Never give in
'Cause happily we'll reign when consequences change
Believe you can win

[Refrain]
Yeah, they say you grow when you don't succeed
But it's hard to breathe when no one believes in me

[Pre-Chorus]
So let the sound bring me back
Sounds have no regrets
And before you know it

[Chorus]
I'll take your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Right to the stars and beyond
Your words, and be gone
I'll take your words, and be gone

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus]
So let the sound bring me back
Sounds have no regrets
And before you know it

[Chorus]
I'll take your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Right to the stars and beyond
Your words, and be gone
I'll take your words, and be gone
Your words and be gone
Your words and be gone
I'll take your words and be gone

[Verse 1]
Living in fear
Is not what you had
In mind for me
But holding to you
Is so hard
I cling to what I see

[Pre-Chorus]
In a world where my emotions
Seem to rule my every move
They will challenge my devotion
To seek and know the truth

[Chorus]
You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all
Of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is You

[Verse 2]
Here in this haze a distant light
Seems to draw me near
But in the shadow of my doubt
My faith just disappears

[Pre-Chorus]
In a world where my emotions
Seem to rule my every move
They will challenge my devotion
To seek and know the truth

[Chorus]
You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all
Of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is You
You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all
Of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is You
You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all
Of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is You
You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all
Of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is You

[Verse 1]
Through this skin you see
My heart
Through this laughter you feel
My pain
Even through this mask you see
My face
For You are the only one who really knows just who I am

[Chorus]
And you search me
And you know all the secrets of my heart
And you search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
You search me

[Verse 2]
Growing up never comes
Easily
In Your hands, You're the potter
Molding me
Then why do I wear this mask and play this game
Of hide and seek
When You are the only one who really knows just who I am

[Chorus]
And you search me
And you know all the secrets of my heart
And you search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
And you search me
And you know all the secrets of my heart
And you search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are

[Bridge]
My Father, my Father
You are my Father, oh, and I am Your child
And you hear my cry, even at the midnight

[Chorus]
And you search me
And you know all the secrets of my heart
And you search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
And you search me
And you know all the secrets of my heart
And you search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
The mysteries of who You are
The mysteries of who You are

[Verse 1: Hiatus Kaiyote]
Hannah my darling
I will follow you into the sunrise under desert sky
We fly, rise together
With our hearts upon our sleeves for all to see
We two will breathe, aqua queen though vast distance between us
Heart sails with love for you
I love you, I love you I do
Love you, I love you, I love you I do
Nakamarra sweet red earth will hold you
Like the strength you bless to me
True we engage humility, watch me struggle with your words
However truthful they may be
We'll see in time, opening our hearts
And nurturing our minds to shine
I love you, love you, I love you I do...
Love you, I love you, I love you I do...

[Verse 3: Hiatus Kaiyote]
Oh, it sets our hearts to fire
Sweeps you and I
Honey don't you know, it sets our heart to fire
Sweeps you and I
Honey don't you know we too will pulse in through this light
Honey don't you know we too will pulse
I'll always love you, love you, love you I do
Love you, I love you, I love you I do

[Hook: Q-Tip & Hiatus Kaiyote]
I'm speaking to you all from the most natural of habitats
White city, ghost jokes
To be something like razorbacks
Talk about us quietly
Your rich social quarters
Bout a fertile land in a roll of lush waters
And they really should embrace us
Cause they know we got science
But the bottom line is
They don't want the brown alliance
They'd rather get our secrets
And little bully, mistreat us
Take our color and our culture
From the foul way they breed us
They are e-fucking-litists
With no intention to free us
And if you believe in love
Then imagine what the key is
The sentiment from me simply, love me
Love you I do, love you I, love you I do

[Verse 3: Hiatus Kaiyote]
Oh, it sets our hearts to fire
Sweeps you and I
Honey don't you know, it sets our heart to fire
Sweeps you and I
Honey don't you know we too will pulse in through this light
Honey don't you know we too will pulse
I'll always love you, love you, love you I do
Love you, I love you, I love you I do...
Yeah yeah yeah...

[Verse 1]
Hello, hello I'm searchin' for a man
With love filled eyes and them healing hands
Hello, hello I've been waiting for so long
Don't disconnect me 'cause it's my last call
For help, yeah, help
For help

[Chorus]
'Cause it's 8-9-9-3-8-3-3
Come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change
'Cause Lord I'm calling on Your name

[Verse 2]
Don't wanna leave, don't wanna say goodbye
Still fifteen minutes for my thirty-five
And where's this good in goodbye?
Cause talking to you is bringing me
This life, yeah, life
This life, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause it's 8-9-9-3-8-3-3
Come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change
'Cause Lord I'm calling on Your name, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, last call
My last call, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
'Cause it's 8-9-9-3-8-3-3
Come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change
'Cause Lord I'm calling on Your name
8-9-9-3-8-3-3
Come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change
'Cause Lord I'm calling on Your name
8-9-9-3-8-3-3
Come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change
'Cause Lord I'm calling on Your name
8-9-9-3-8-3-3
Come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change
'Cause Lord I'm calling on Your name
I'm calling on Your name
I'm calling on Your name

[Outro]
This is my last call
This is my last call

[Verse 1]
You would think that I could find
A simple song, a photograph of mine
To show this public eye what I have to offer
I may not have a PhD
Or speak in eloquent philosophy
I'm nothing more than simply me, you'll see

[Pre-Chorus]
What I am trying to say, hey
I'm just a babe in so many ways

[Chorus]
I'm still growing, still stretching
Still breaking in these new shoes
Looking for a way to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick, wet behind the ears
It's a part of life, so there's no need to fear
These growing pains that I'm going through

[Verse 2]
I don't regret, I'm not ashamed
That I haven't yet begun to speaketh ways (As the wisest of men)
Oh perhaps some day but for now I'm grateful
To be a part of the family tree
While The Man upstairs does His work on me
It's a job that may take eternity to complete
Just when I've learned all I can
Those growing pains up and kick on in again

[Chorus]
Still growing, still stretching
Still breaking in these new shoes
Looking for a way to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick, wet behind the ears
It's a part of life, so there's no need to fear
These growing pains that I'm going through

[Verse 3]
Time after time, one more time and again
Will it ever end?
It's the lessons in our lives that make us wise
But young or old, I am told it's the same
Oh, these growing pains never go away
So I'll just keep on trying

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
What I am trying to say, hey
I'm just a babe in so many ways

[Chorus]
Still growing, still stretching
Still breaking in these new shoes
Looking for a way to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick, wet behind the ears
It's a part of life, so there's no need to fear
These growing pains that I'm going through
Oh, baby don't worry about a thing

[Outro]
Thank you
Thank you very much
Thank you
Thank you

[Verse 1]
I turn my head, there's nothing there
All I own is my thoughts for my fears
I close the door to keep out the bad
I plug my ears to keep out these fears
And I cry

[Chorus]
So hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold, hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold me

[Verse 2]
I listen to these voices
Or is it this house that's giving me chills
As I lie upon this little girl's bed?
Who's at the door? Who's walking near?
Or has my imagination spilled?
This little girl all grown up still fears
Oh, and I cry

[Chorus]
So hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold, hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold me

[Verse 3]
Where can I go, where can I hide
From these evil sufferings?
Oh, these images painted on my walls
They say there's a place that I can
Hide in the shadow of your wings
Oh Lord, bring me to this place of refuge
No more tears

[Chorus]
So hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold, hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired, and tired and tired, and tired and tired
Oh, so tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold me, hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold me, oh, oh
I am so tired
Oh Lord, I'm so tired
Oh, oh

[Outro]
Hold me
Me, me

[Verse 1]
If You came by me
Would I crown You my King
Or brush You off as though
I really didn't see
If You walked by my side
Would our souls then be unified
I swore Your name
Would never be denied

[Chorus]
But I took up this hammer
And laughed at all Your slander
And pierced Your hands
With the nails of blasphemy
How could I do this? I don't know
Said something forced me to it, so
Spit in Your face and passed You by

[Verse 2]
But time and time again
I'd live that life of sin
I knew it hurt you bad
But I wasn't ready to give in
Maybe someday
But not this day I said
I wanted to live my life
I was willing to pay the price

[Chorus]
But I took up this hammer
And laughed at all Your slander
And pierced Your hands
With the nails of blasphemy
How could I do this? I don't know
Said something forced me to it, so
Spit in Your face and passed You by
('Cause I'd forgotten those words
Your name won't be denied)

[Verse 3]
But looking into my eyes
I knew You felt this heart's cry
I needed You
Bad my life was oh so sad
But looking back at all this pain
This guilt, this strife
Would You take it all away
If I were to give you back my life?

[Bridge]
But You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee

[Verse 4]
He was hanging on a cross
With a crown of thorns
In His head
He was hanging on a cross
With a crown of thorns
In His head
He was hanging on a cross
With a crown of thorns
In His head
He was hanging on a cross
With a crown of thorns
In His head

[Outro]
And You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
You could throw me in the fire
And I won't be burned
For my faith is Your desire
And Your, Your love endures
You could throw me in the prison cell
Shackle me up against the rail
But time and time again
My faith won't fail

[Chorus]
For He'll prevail
In the midst of all my trials and tribulations
He'll prevail
In the midst of all my sin and temptations
He'll prevail
When I fall and He'll, He'll pick me up
For time and time again
My faith won't fail
Oh, time and time again
My faith won't fail

[Verse 2]
You could cast me in the lion's den
But they won't harm me
For Your grace surrounds me
And it sets me free
And I can walk upon the water
And I will not drown
For my eyes are set upon You
And no one can bring me down

[Chorus]
For He'll prevail
In the midst of all my trials and tribulations
He'll prevail
In the midst of all my sin and temptations
He'll prevail
When I fall and He'll will pick me up
For time and time again
My faith won't fail
Time and time again
My faith won't fail

[Bridge]
For His angels surround me
And You've poured out this blood covering, yeah, yeah, yeah
And I will walk and not fail, oh
For time and time again
My faith won't fail
Time and time again
My faith won't fail

[Chorus]
For He'll prevail
In the midst of all my trials and tribulations
He'll prevail
In the midst of all my sin and temptations
He'll prevail
When I fall and He'll will pick me up
For time and time again
He'll prevail
In the midst of all my trials and tribulations
He'll prevail
In the midst of all my sin and temptations
He'll prevail
When I fall and He will, He'll pick me up
For time and time again
My faith won't fail
Oh, for time and time again
My faith won't fail
Oh, for time and time again
My faith won't fail

[Verse 1]
Did it seem to disappoint you, living alone?
By the banks of your dilemma, out of control
No one seems to give the answers, that you wanna hear
What you'd give to find a welcome here

[Verse 2]
Miles and miles of lies behind you, those were the days
So many lives you'd hope would guide you, help you find a way
Now it seems to your surprise that they left you lying here
What you'd give to dry these bitter tears

[Chorus]
Did it come naturally? You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully to live a life that's not your own
Always remember that it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans, I moved the mountains to say I love you

[Verse 3]
Heaven waits the hours of silence, finds you on your knees
Broken in a sweet surrender of peace
All the years of searching for a love you didn't know
Now you've finally found a welcome home

[Chorus]
Did it come naturally? You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully to live a life that's not your own
Always remember that it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans, I moved the mountains to say I love you

[Bridge]
I love you, I have
And I always will

[Chorus]
Did it come naturally? You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully to live a life that's not your own
Always remember that it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans, I moved the mountains to say
Did it come naturally? You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully to live a life that's not your own
Always remember that it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans, I moved the mountains to say I love you

[Verse 1]
When there's nothing left to give
I will give you more than I ever gave before
When there's nothing left to say
I'll say it all again, but until then

[Chorus]
And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
Say I love you
And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
Oh, 'cause I do, Jesus

[Verse 2]
No music to play so I sing you my own song
Come on and sing along
When there's nothing that remains
You still stay the same
You're looking so strong

[Chorus]
And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
Say I love you
And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
Oh, 'cause I do, Jesus

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
I'm gonna, I'm gonna say I love you
And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
Oh, 'cause I do, sweet Jesus

[Bridge]
When there's nothing left to give
I will give you more than I ever gave before

[Outro]
I'm gonna give you my heart
I'm gonna give you my heart

[Verse 1]
You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi
'Cause you're hungover and I'm broke
I lost my fake ID
But you lost the motel key
Spare me your freakin' dirty looks now
Don't blame me

[Pre-Chorus]
You wanna cash out
And get the hell outta town
Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me

[Chorus]
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

[Verse 2]
Why are these lights so bright?
Did we get hitched last night?
Dressed up like Elvis
Why am I wearing your class ring?

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't call your mother
'Cause now we're partners in crime
Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me

[Chorus]
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

[Bridge]
You got me into this
Information overload, situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S.
(Oh) Ha, and get some cash out
(Oh) We're gonna tear up the town
(Oh) No, don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me, told me, told me
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

[Outro]
That's what you get, baby
Shake the glitter
Shake, shake, shake the glitter
Gimme some cash out, baby
Gimme some cash out, baby

[Verse 1]
Comparisons are easily done
Once you've had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I picked the ripest one
I still got the seed

[Pre-Chorus]
You said move on, where do I go?
I guess second best is all I will know

[Chorus]
'Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you (Thinking of you, thinking of you)
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was
Spending the night (Spending the night, spending the night)
Oh, I wish that I
Was looking into your eyes

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter
Like a hard candy with a surprise center
How do I get better once I've had the best?
You said there's tons of fish in the water
So the waters I will test

[Pre-Chorus]
He kissed my lips, I taste your mouth (I taste your mouth)
Oh, he pulled me in, I was disgusted with myself

[Chorus]
'Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you (Thinking of you, thinking of you)
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was
Spending the night (Spending the night, spending the night)
Oh, I wish that I
Was looking into your...

[Bridge]
The best
And yes, I do regret
How I could let myself let you go
Now, now the lesson's learned
I touched it, I was burned
Oh, I think you should know

[Chorus]
'Cause when I'm with him (Oh)
I am thinking of you (Oh) (Thinking of you, thinking of you)
Thinking of you (Oh)
What you would do if
You were the one who was
Spending the night (Spending the night, spending the night)
Oh, I wish that I
Was looking into your, your eyes

[Outro]
Looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Oh, won't you walk through
And bust in the door and
Take me away?
Oh, no more mistakes
'Cause in your eyes, I'd like to stay
Stay

[Verse 1]
How do I get closer to you
When you keep it all on mute?
How will I know the right way to love you?
Usually the queen of figuring out
Breaking down a man is no workout
But I have no clue how to get through to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I wanna hit you just to see if you cry
I keep knocking on wood
Hoping there's a real boy inside

[Chorus]
'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man

[Verse 2]
I wish I could just turn you on
Put a battery in, make you talk
Even pull a string for you to say anything
But with you, there is no guarantee
Only expired warranty
A bunch of broken parts
And I can't seem to find your heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm such a fool, I'm such a fool, I'm such a fool
This one's out of my hands
I can't put you back together again

[Chorus]
'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man
You're just a toy
Could you ever be a real, real boy and understand?
But you're not a man

[Bridge]
If the past is the problem
Our future could solve 'em, baby
I could bring you to life
If you let me inside, baby
It'll hurt, but in the end
You'll be a man

[Chorus]
You're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real, oh
Toy, could you ever be a real, real boy and understand?
But you're not a man

[Chorus]
You're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man

[Verse 1]
You change your mind like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS like a bitch, I would know
And you overthink, always speak cryptically
I should know that you're no good for me

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

[Post-Chorus]
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

[Verse 2]
We used to be just like twins, so in sync
The same energy now's a dead battery
Used to laugh (Used to laugh) 'bout nothing ('Bout nothing)
Now you're plain (Now you're plain) boring (Boring)
I should know (I should know)
That you're not gonna change

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

[Post-Chorus]
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no (Oh)
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh (Oh)
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

[Bridge]
Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride
You change your mind like a girl changes clothes

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

[Chorus]
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

[Post-Chorus]
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no (Oh)
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh (Oh)
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

[Verse 1]
If you want me
The cherry on top, the pick of the pack, the crème de la crop
If you want me, you better do better than that tonight
Oh-oh
If you want me, it takes more than a wink
More than a drink, more than you think
If you want me, you're gonna have to break the bank, tonight

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause some don't have the patience
Some call me high maintenance
But you pay the bill, 'cause that's the deal

[Chorus]
If you wanna ride, just name your price
And don't play cheap with your heart
And don't make a bet if you can't write the check for me
For me
'Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me

[Verse 2]
If you want me, I'm not a piece of ass
A one-night stand, a storage shed
I think you better walk by, tonight, oh no
If you want me, then stop begging
I don't put out for charity
If you want me, there's no discount price tonight

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I don't need your dollar bills
I just want something real
'Cause nothing's free, except loving me

[Chorus]
If you wanna ride, just name your price
And don't play cheap with your heart
And don't make a bet if you can't write the check for me
For me
'Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me

[Breakdown]
If you want me
The cherry on top, the pick of the pack, the crème de la crop

[Chorus]
If you wanna ride, just name your price
And don't play cheap with your heart
And don't make a bet if you can't write the check for me
For me
'Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me
If you wanna ride, just name your price
And don't play cheap with your heart
And don't make a bet if you can't write the check for me
For me
'Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me

[Verse 1]
I'm out on my own again
Face down in the porcelain
Feeling so high, but looking so low
Party favors on the floor
Group of girls banging on the door
So many new fair-weather friends
Oh-oh-oh

[Chorus 1]
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost

[Verse 2]
Caught in the eye of a hurricane
Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade
So sick of this town, pulling me down
My mother says I should come back home, but
Can't find the way, 'cause the way is gone
So if I pray, am I just sending words into outer space?

[Chorus 2]
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost?

[Bridge]
Is there a light?
Is there a light?
At the end of the road
I'm pushing everyone away, 'cause I can't feel this anymore
Feel this anymore

[Chorus]
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost?
Have you ever been so lost?

[Verse 1]
Remember when I dove into the crowd
And I got a bloody knee under my skin?
A mark from wiping out
It brings back the memories
Every bone's been broken, but my heart is still wide open

[Chorus]
I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to

[Verse 2]
With each scar, there's a map that tells a story
What a souvenir of young love's like jumping out
An airplane riding a tidal wave of an ocean of emotion
My heart rips me wide open

[Chorus]
I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to

[Bridge]
And I cover up these scars
(We'll make it, we'll make it, but we break it)
And I can't stop seeing stars
(Let's hope, not die)
Whenever you're around, around

[Chorus]
I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to

[Outro]
I can't stop
No, I can't stop
No, I can't stop
Oh, I'm going out in flames
Oh, I'm going down in flames
Ohh
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose

[Verse 1]
I leave the gas on
Walk the alleys in the dark
Sleep with candles burning
I leave the door unlocked
I'm weaving a rope and
Running all the red lights
Did I get your attention?
'Cause I'm sending all the signs that

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The clock is ticking
And I'll be giving my two weeks
Pick your favorite shade of black
You'd best prepare a speech
Say something funny
Say something sweet
But don't say that you loved me

[Chorus]
I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Already lost our grip
Best abandon ship, oh

[Verse 2]
Maybe I was too pale
Maybe I was too fat
Maybe you had better
Better luck in the sack
No formal education
And I swore way too much
But I swear you didn't care
'Cause we were in love

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So as I write this letter
And shed my last tear
It's all for the better
That we end this here
Let's close this chapter
Say one last prayer
But don't say that you loved me

[Chorus]
I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Oh, we've been diagnosed
So let's give up the ghost
'Cause I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Already lost our grip
Best abandon ship, oh

[Outro]
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
Ohh

[Verse 1]
Voted most likely to end up on the back of a milk box drink
Looks like I'm letting 'em down
'Cause $7.75 isn't worth an hour of my hard working time
When you can't afford half the shit they advertise
Oh, I'm worth more than a X
More than a toe-tagged generation full of regrets
Oh, I won't settle, no oh
Oh, I can't settle

[Pre Chorus]
I wanna break the mold, wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air, I'm not going down without a fight

[Chorus]
It's my life
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark, I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints on you

[Verse 2]
Representing you and me
Don't you wanna go down in history?
Rather than end up begging on the streets
Trading under table favors for a place to sleep
'Cause I'm worth more than this
So stop writing prescriptions for more Ritalin
I can focus my attention

[Pre Chorus]
I wanna break the mold, wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air, I'm not going down without a fight

[Chorus]
It's my life
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark, I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints

[Bridge]
Don't give up
Don't give in
Build your house on the rock
Oh, not in the sand, in the sand, in the sand, in the sand

[Chorus]
It's my life
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark, I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
It's my life
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark, I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me

[Outro]
'Cause I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I-I'm leaving my fingerprints in the end

[Verse 1]
I'm used to opening my own doors and splitting the checks
He introduced me, was always just the friend
I bought a new dress, he never noticed
Always falling for these bad boys, such a challenge
I'm getting tired, of cleaning up after them
I think I'm ready to be a woman

[Chorus]
Oh, love, I think I'm ready, ready for it

[Verse 2]
You were such a surprise
An unexpected gift
Said I was pretty, and I believed it
Not really used to all this attention
Told myself I don't deserve you
And this is just a phase
Could I get used to, being loved the right way?
I want to argue, but there is nothing to say

[Chorus]
Oh, love, I think I'm ready, ready for it
(Ready for it)
Oh, love, I think I'm ready

[Verse 3]
'Cause you send me flowers when there's no occasion
Yeah, we talk for hours, you still want to listen
Won't hold it against me if I just need you to hold me tonight
My mother always told me that you'd show up one day
So scared to feel this way

[Chorus]
But, love, I think I'm ready, ready for it
(Ready for it)
Oh, love, I think I'm ready, ready for it
(Ready for it)
Oh, love, I think I'm ready

[Verse 1]
I take these turns a bit too fast
Trying to leave you in my past
The CD skips our favorite songs
Our greatest hits just don't belong
I really love to hate this
Love hate, hate love relationships

[Pre-Chorus]
Are overrated
Over my dead body is how this will end
You said it's over
And I could go for another chance to do this over again

[Chorus]
So this is it?
After all we've been through
We called it quits
And I'm about to
I lost my grip
On what little I had left
You said it's over
And I could really go for a cup of coffee and an overdose
Leave it all behind me
You'll see it when you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close
Cup of coffee and an overdose

[Verse 2]
I pop these pills like cracker jacks
And the prize, the glazed eyes
Just watching you react
When you're depressed you sleep too much
I'm not sure if I'm waking up

[Pre-Chorus]
It's overrated
Over my dead body is how this will end
You said it's over
And I could go for another chance to do this over again

[Chorus]
So this is it?
After all we've been through
We called it quits
And I'm about to
I lost my grip
On what little I had left
You said it's over
And I could really go for a cup of coffee and an overdose
Leave it all behind me
You'll see it when you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close
Cup of coffee and an overdose

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You said it's over
And I could really go for a cup of coffee and an overdose
Leave it all behind me
You'll see it when you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close

[Outro]
I stood in line without you, oh
I stood in line without you, I, I-I-I-I
I stood in line
(I stood in line without you and I don't tell you what they ever thought)
I stood in line without you (About you)
I stood in line without you (Well without you)
I stood in line without you (Is everything I've got)
(I stood in line without you and I don't tell you all they ever thought about you)
And only, only ever thought about your pretty face
(Well, without you is everything I've got)
(I stood in line without you)

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
My shadow side, so amplified, keeps coming back dissatisfied
Elementary sun, but it's so—
My love affair, with everywhere, was innocent, why do you care?
Someone start the car, time to go
You're the best I know

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
My sunny side has up and died, I'm betting that when we collide
The universe will shift into a low
The travesties that we have seen are treating me like Benzedrine
Automatic laughter from a pro

[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis]
My, what a good day for a... a walk outside
I'd like to get to know you a little better, baby
God knows that I really tried
My, what a good day for a.. a take out bride
I'd like to say we did it for the better of–

[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis]
I saw you there so unaware, those hummingbirds all in your hair
Elementary sun, but it's so—
The disrepair of Norma Jean could not compare to your routine
Balarama beauty goin' toe to toe

[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis]
My, what a good day for a... let it slide
I'd like to say we did it for the better of–

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]
I thought about it and I brought it out
I'm motivated by the lack of doubt
I'm consecrated, but I'm not devout
The mother, the father, the daughter
Yeah!

[Verse 4: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
(Uh-uh-uh)
Right on the verge, just one more dose, I'm traveling from coast to coast
My theory isn't perfect, but it's close
(Uuh-uh-uh)
I'm almost there, why should I care? My heart is hurting when I share
Someone open up, let it show

[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis]
My, what a good day for a walk outside
I'd like to think we did it for the better of–
Yeah!

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]
I thought about it and I brought it out
I'm motivated by the lack of doubt
I'm consecrated, but I'm not devout
The mother, the father, the daughter

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante, & Both]
Oh, you don't form in the wet sand
You don't form at all
Woah, you don't form in the wet sand
I do (Yeah)
You don't form in the wet sand
You don't form at all
Woah, you don't form in the wet sand
I do
Yeah!

[Guitar Solo Outro: John Frusciante]

[Action Bronson]
Shit yo, it's like I'm always dunking on Dikembe Mutombo

[Verse 1]
Hang ten on the Donald Takayama
Nose rider, hoes after the show diver
You know I'm talking 'bout vergina
Puerto Rican doped face wearing lana
Drink from the goblet, that was dope, cause I was chosen
First pick on the surf shit
Reverse whip on some shorty keep the iron in your purse shit
Get your shirt lift
I'm into spending hundreds reckless
I'm on some next shit
Chinese staircase necklace, roll in Lexus'
420 SC, yes he
Be doing fucking endos on the jetski
Rolling hundreds of the best tree
Hoop it up, I put myself against your best three
Dunk on Dikembe
If not for minor set backs I would have been paid
Walk with a pimp leg
It's me

[Big Body Bes]
Uh, yeah
It's me once a-motherfucking-gain
Big fucking Body. You know what I'm doing

[Verse 2]
The work flipped like Ozzie Smith
The whip was Olive-ish
The fact I'm gorgeous, gained acknowledgement
My eyes are sharper than a pilot probably screamin' Kamikaze
Shit pass that boom bah bah zi
I'm hittin' skins cuz I'm fresh, smokin dope
Had the homie there, gave the bitch the Okie-Doke
Eleven thousand on the overcoat straight from Nova Scot
Hover on boats, wines with summer notes

[Big Body Bes]
Ugh straight exquisite shit
1000 dollar dinners at Red Lobster
Catch me in the water
Using your moms like a Jetski

[Verse 3: Action Bronson]
I spit the rum in the rooster's face
Born with exclusive taste
Make the Caddy candy orange with the Fucshia base
Make my shorty milk chocolate with the Cuban waist
Gun in the waist quick to shoot the Jake
I view the lake while I chew the steak
The estate came with the lake
The lake came with the boat, the boat came with the leather seats
Dark skin just like Heather B
Look like a shark in the 7 series
The leather trench with the feather earring
Racing package, better steering
Hide the cheddar in the ceilin', I'm peelin, for realin'

[Outro: Big Body Bes]
Yeah it's me man, you know what time it is man
It's the Motherfucking summer time
It's my time to shine
I'm out here on my motherfucking glory man
It's me Big Body
I'm out here, pockets stuffed like my favorite fish
I'm out here living it up man
You know what time it is man
I don't eat nothing unless it comes on top of rice
I'm out here man living my motherfucking life
Shouts to my moms man, out here wildin'
You know your boy is out here doing big fucking things man
You know what time it is man
I'm out here catch me in the water man
All types of motherfuckin water sports man
I'm out here man, you know what time it is man
I got the bathing suit down to the ankle, the long shits
Motherfucking fly shit from France
Man fuck that Canal Street shit
I'm out here wildin'
Fuck that bail money on me
Stay shut the fuck up man
That's it man happy fucking Ramadan man
I can't put up with this shit

You feel that go tell that to that trick, LS that's how less that's drop top for you square chicks

[Verse 1]
I was living in a small mind
With no lifeline
And no messages can reach me from the outside
When I looked out over the horizon
Didn't notice the sun was setting or just rising

[Verse 2]
Then it hit me
Maybe bit me
Then I knew, quite a few would not go with me
I didn't know exactly where I would be going
But I had to let this river in me flowing

[Bridge]
What a ride
When you open your eyes
For the very first time
A real surprise

[Chorus]
I started living outside of the box
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop
Living outside of the box
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not
I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water, every moment I'm alive

[Verse 3]
I was living on a fault line
The fault was all mine
And this unstable ground found me down half the time
But I had enough
I had to get up
I had to shrug it all off 'cause it's the same old stuff

[Verse 4]
Then it hit me
You won't permit me
To be an individual
Just doesn't fit me
But I decided that it's going to be living
Yeah, I decided I'm escaping from your prison

[Pre-Chorus]
What a high
When you open your mind for the very first time
A real surprise

[Chorus]
I started living outside of the box
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop
Living outside of the box
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not
I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water, every moment I'm alive

[Verse 5]
So long conformity
And ambiguity is a new priority
All it takes, for heaven sakes
Is to figure out the face and learn to separate

[Chorus]
I started living outside of the box
Taking my time when I always used to rush
Living outside of the box
Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not
I always knew this day would come
When I broke down the walls for my liberation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive

[Bridge]
Oh, living outside of the box
Oh, living outside of the box
Oh, living outside
Ha ha ha
I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation

[Outro]
Oh, living outside of the box
Of the box, of your life
Of everything that seems nice
Oh, living outside of the box

[Verse 1]
The weight of my words
Are like feathers from a bird
My mouth, it moves, but you won't hear a thing
'Cause I've dug myself deep
I managed to fit both my hands and feet
All my little white lies
Smell like a big old bucket of bleach

[Pre-Chorus 1]
In one ear and out your other
So lock and key
You won't open up for me

[Chorus]
So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on us

[Verse 2]
And it feels like you're in China
And I am in Peru
Whenever I am sleeping next to you, oh
We can hear the crickets singing
Oh, all throughout the night
Oh, boy can't you just get used to something so right?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And sure I confess
I'm a mess, I'm a mess of mistakes
But please count to ten before you go and throw it all away

[Chorus]
So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on us

[Bridge]
'Cause if you give up
Then what am I supposed to do?
All of our dreams never will come true without you

[Final Chorus]
So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm not giving, giving, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm not giving, giving, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Oh, baby, don't give up on this love

[Verse 1]
I wear the red shoes
With the holes
To remind me
What we went through
Sit down here
Kick 'em off enough
Not had enough of you
I tell you
You know
The car you drive
Keeps breaking down
And never starts
Next thing
I'm pulling up to you
We're in the backseat
Driving it home
No one wants
To be alone

[Chorus]
What do you do?
What do you do
When everything
Is broken?
What do you say?
What do you say
When no words
Fit the moment?
'Cuz you're not here
And even if you were
All I could say
Is what do I do?
What do I do?
We're broken
But I can't
Throw us away

[Verse 2]
The video
Of our vacation's
Chewed up in the drawer
Beside me
She thinks I never got
To watch it
I'm so glad
I made a copy
The sky
Got bitter twisted
Just like you and me
I miss it
You snap it
Bend it
Burn it
Then you find
That you can't fix it
Fall back on whatever
Still remains

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Breaking you in
Breaking your heart
I was taking it all
And I tore you apart
Breaking me in
Breaking my heart
And the damage was done
But I took what you got
We were breaking' it
Smashing' it
Taking' it
Loving' it
Hating' it
Driving' it home
And now I'm all
Now I'm all alone

[Bridge]
Oh, yeah 

[4x]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
What do I do?
We're broken
But I can't
Throw us away

[Verse 1]
My mama warned me about boys like you
It’s the reason I wear these steel toed boots, yeah
And let me give you a little piece of advice
My papa packs heat and he won’t think twice, yeah

[Verse 2]
Well, why do you think they call me Jessie James?
Too much trouble better stay away
Grab your hat, better get gone
But if you stay, you’ve been warned

[Chorus]
I’m a bullet and I’m headed
Straight for you heart (yeah)
Be careful what you start!
I’m a bullet and I’m headed
Straight for you heart (yeah)
It’s gonna leave a mark!

[Verse 3]
Well, every now and then I make a man break a sweat
Watch him work overtime on my wristbands (yeah)
Cause I’m the kinda girl that you wanna show off
I’ll tell ’em all your friends with a southern drawl (yeah)

[Verse 4]
Well, why do you think they call me Jessie James?
Sweet as a peach, impossible to tame
Fingers on the trigger and you’ll be to blame
Cause if you stay

[Chorus]
I’m a bullet and I’m headed
Straight for you heart (yeah)
Be careful what you start!
I’m a bullet and I’m headed
Straight for you heart (yeah)
It’s gonna leave a mark!

[Verse 5]
I’ll ride where the wind wants to take me
Leaving lovers in the dust every city
'Cause my heart was like a ghost town baby
And now I've met a man that breaks me

[Bridge]
My mama warned me about boys like you
It’s the reason I wear these steel toed boots

[Chorus]
I’m a bullet and I’m headed
Straight for you heart (yeah)
Be careful what you start!
I'm a bullet and I’m headed
Straight for you heart (yeah)
It’s gonna leave a mark!
Straight for you heart (yeah, yeah)
I'm a bullet and I’m headed
Straight for you heart (yeah)
It’s gonna leave a mark!

[Verse 1]
We woke up late, said goodbye
Now I'm standing outside on the street
I walk through the city, I'm laughing
In case staring down at my feet
If I look up, the sky might fall
Open up and pull me in
I feel like an angel who's fallen
But I just got to have the taste of original sin

[Chorus]
Damn, can you feel it?
Damn I can't believe it
Damn you got me feeling good
Damn, do you dig it
That's the way you do it
Damn you know you give it good

[Verse 2]
Two minutes later, I'm counting
The seconds and hours to go
Working a sweat out of bed
Just the thought of you is making me glow
I got the fact that you get it good
Now back up and just leave it alone
I'm walking on air cuz your crunk
Now I'm going home to do it all again on my own

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You got my tongue, it's so tied
My eyes are open wide
And my hair is standing up on my skin
And I keep saying:

Damn, do you dig it
That's the way you do it
Damn you know you give it good

[Verse 4]
Walk through the door, and enter your room
Cause this whole world lies but you tell the truth
Do you think I'm gonna give you up?
You never gonna let me down
Your love is like an ocean and I'm starting to drown

[Verse 5]
You got my tongue, it's so tied
My eyes are open wide
And my hair is standing up on my skin
And I keep saying:

Damn, do you dig it
That's the way you do it
Damn you know you give it good

[Outro]
Damn, I can't believe it, I can't believe it
Ooh you got me feeling good good good

[Verse 1]
I've got people to see
Places to go
Deadlines to meet
A reputation to up hold
It's like a ton of bricks
Breaking on my back
It’s like
The force of gravity
In full effect

[Verse 2]
I got money to burn
And I'm on the sake
They bet their bomb on me
Cause I'm their ace of spades
I feel the walls
Getting closer
I'm like a bomb
With all red wires

[Chorus]
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe it means
I'm gonna be
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe this means
I'm gonna be

[Verse 3]
A diamond
It won't ever bend
A diamond
Cause there ladies
Best friends a diamond
But there
There has to be more
Than what these pirates
Are gambling for

[Verse 4]
If not for the push
I’d probably be a pebble
If not for the pressure
I’d be forgotten forever
Just another stone
Skipped upon the water
Drowning fast before
The other failures

[Verse 5]
I don't wanna be
A distant memory
On your wall
Just another cd
That you burned
And never bought
Am I not worth it to you?
After all that drama
That we've been though?

[Chorus]
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe it means
I'm gonna be
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe this means
I'm gonna be

[Verse 6]
A diamond
It won't ever bend
A diamond
Cause there ladies
Best friends
A diamond
But there
There has to be more
Than what these pirates
Are gambling for

[Verse 7]
Ooh ooh  diamond
I've gotta be a diamond
(I'm a diamond in the sky
With you standing by
Now catch me if I fall)
Oh  oh  oh
Yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe it means
I'm gonna be
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe this means
I'm gonna be

[Verse 8]
I'm a diamond in the sky
With you standing by
Now catch me if I fall
Into the arms of a coma

[Outro]
All this pressure
I've got pressure
I'm gonna be a diamond baby
I've gotta be a diamond
Your gonna see
I'm gonna be a diamond

[Verse 1]
You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

[Chorus]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Verse 2]
You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

[Pre-Chorus]
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

[Chorus]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Bridge]
This is transcendental
On another level
Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wavelength
And be there when you vibrate
For you, I'll risk it all, all

[Chorus]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Outro]
Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Verse 1]
I used to know you when we were young
You were in all my dreams
We sat together in period one
Fridays at 8:15
Now I see your face in the strangest places
Movies and magazines
Yeah, I saw you talking to Christopher Walken
On my TV screen

[Chorus]
But I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you

[Verse 2]
I used to work at the record store
Now I work for my dad
Scraping the paint off of the hardwood floors
The hours are pretty bad
Sometimes I wonder where you are
Probably in L.A
That seems to be where everybody else ends up these days

[Chorus]
And I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you, yeah

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you, yeah

[Outro]
Thank you, thank you

[Intro]
Oh, sweetheart, put the bottle down
You've got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure, you've found it

[Verse 1]
Slow motion, sparks you caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys oh, yes they will
They don't want to define it
Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills, then get cold feet

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow, so if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing in your pants
And your heart on your sleeve

[Chorus]
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

[Verse 2]
I can't cook, no but I can clean
Up the mess you left
Lay your head down
And feel the beat as I kiss

[Verse 3]
Your forehead, this may not last
But this is now
So love the one you're with
You wanna chase
But you're chasing your tail
Quick fix won't ever get you well

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow, so if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing in your pants
And your heart on your sleeve

[Chorus]
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

[Bridge]
'Cause I feel the distance between us
Could be over with a snap of your fingers
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow, so if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing in your pants
And your heart on your sleeve

[Chorus]
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

[Outro]
Oh, sweetheart
Put the bottle down
'Cause you don't
Wanna miss out

[Verse 1]
This was big for us
Forever changing you and me
Allow me to be ambiguous
Though I can't stand ambiguity
I'll beat around this burning bush
Trying to put the fire out
When all the shoving came to push
The words just stayed stuck in my mouth

[Chorus]
'Cause it's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone
Ba da da dum
It's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone, yeah
Ba da da dum

[Verse 2]
So we might lose
But I'm glad I didn't leave
I wear my soul on my shoes
If not my heart upon my sleeve
If I'm not allowed to speak aloud
Of what you really mean to me
Then'll type it bold when I spell it out
I T S L O V E

[Chorus]
'Cause it's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone
Ba da da dum
It's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone, yeah
Ba da da dum

[Bridge]
So why do I hesitate for my cocoon to break?
Second guess every move that I make
(Second guess every move that you make)
This was big for us
Changing you and me

[Chorus]
Oh, somebody tell me
It's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your life for someone, yeah
Ba da da dum

[Outro]
Stand up for what you believe in
Take pride for who you are
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Stand up for what you believe in
Take pride for who you are
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Stand up for what you believe in
Take pride for who you are
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
You're such a poet
I wish I could be Wesley Willis
My words would flow like honey, sweet and laid on thick
You're so edgy
You dont even need a rhyming dictionary
I wipe my hands on your jeans, cause they are more distressed
So they say--you got O.C.D
And they claim you can barely read
But you say "Don't bother me with all of your reality"

[Chorus]
But it could be so simple
(you were thinking)
Life should be that simple
(Who would have thought it)
I wish it were just so simple
(don't know what you were thinking)
But the point's been missed
You've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems

[Verse 2]
So what, you're a genius
But you've got a lot to learn
Like the time you lost your apartment
Cause you bought too much Vuitton
You park in a loading zone
You sleep with the lights all on
You cross your i's and dot your t's
All it goes to show

[Chorus]
That it could be so simple
(You were thinking)
Life should be that simple
(Who would have thought it)
I wish it were just that simple
(don't know what you were thinking)
The point's been missed
We've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems

[Verse 3]
I'm not saying that it's a piece of cake
Just take a moment to re-evaluate
The possibilities
The situations
The opportunities
That are waiting
Oh, the possibilities
Oh, I

[Chorus]
That it could be so simple
(You were thinking)
Life should be that simple
(Who would have thought it)
I wish it were just that simple
(don't know what you were thinking)
The point's been missed
We've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems

[Verse 4]
We could talk all day
About your eccentricities
What I mean to say
Oh, is that I need you listen please
And focus on life's simplicities
So don't be afraid to strip it away
Cause at the end of the day
It's still as simple as it seems

[Outro]
It is all so simple
Just deal with it

[Verse 1]
I know you know my boyfriend is out of town
So have a drink, let's talk it over
So many things I shouldn't be saying now
You know, I like my boys a little bit older

[Chorus]
I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

[Verse 2]
All my girls are nowhere to be found
They all split when I'm in trouble
But I'll tell you all my secrets if you stick around
The undercover lovers under the covers

[Chorus]
I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

[Bridge]
I just wanna use your lo-uh-ove, lo-uh-ove
I just wanna use your lo-uh-ove, lo-uh-ove
I just wanna use your lo-uh-ove, lo-uh-ove, lo-uh-uh-uh-ove

[Bridge]
Trying to stop my head from spinning
Too much to drink, not making sense
It's been a while since I've been with someone new
That I can't stop the way I'm feeling

[Verse 4]
As you leave, please, would you just close the door?
Now that our love affair is over
You're exactly what I was looking for
We'll find a shoulder to cry upon

[Chorus]
I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I just wanna use your love
(Oh, I just wanna use your love, baby)
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I just wanna use your love
(Oh, I just wanna use your love, baby)
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
(You don't mean nothing at all to me)
I just wanna use your love
(You don't mean nothing at all to me)
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
(You don't mean nothing at all to me)
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
(You don't mean nothing at all to me)

[Outro]
I think I'm done fucking singing this song, song
I think I'm done fucking singing this song, song
I think I'm done fucking singing this song
Singing this song, song, song, song, song

[Refrain]
I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock

[Verse 1]
Word on the street, you got somethin' to show me, me
Magical, colorful, Mr. Mystery
I'm intrigued for a peek, heard it's fascinating
(C'mon, baby, let me see what you hiding underneath)
What's up your sleeve?
Such a tease
Wanna see the show in 3D, a movie
Heard it's beautiful
Be the judge and my girls gonna take a vote
(C'mon, baby, let me see what you hiding underneath)

[Pre-Chorus]
I want the jaw-dropping, eye-popping
Head-turning, body-shocking
(Oh-oh-ayo, oh-oh, ayo)
I want my heart throbbing, ground shaking
Show stopping, amazing
(Oh-oh-ayo, oh-oh, ayo)

[Chorus]
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Don't be a chicken, boy, stop acting like a bi-otch
I'ma peace out if you don't give me the payoff
C'mon, baby, let me see what you hiding underneath
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Whatcha waiting for, it's time for you to show it off
Don't be a shy kind of guy, I bet it's beautiful
C'mon, baby, let me see what you hiding underneath

[Refrain]
I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock

Your peacock

[Verse 2]
Skip the talk, heard it all, time to walk the walk
Break me off, if you bad, show me who's the boss
Need some goose, to get loose, come on take a shot
(C'mon, baby, let me see what you hiding underneath)

[Pre-Chorus]
I want the jaw-dropping, eye-popping
Head-turning, body-shocking
(Oh-ayo, oh-oh, ayo)
I want my heart throbbing, ground shaking
Show stopping, amazing

[Bridge]
Oh my god, no exaggeration
Boy, all this time was worth the waiting
I just shed a tear, I am so unprepared
You got the finest architecture
End of the rainbow-looking treasure
Such a sight to see
And it's all for me

[Chorus]
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Don't be a chicken, boy, stop acting like a bi-otch
I'ma peace out if you don't give me the payoff
C'mon, baby, let me see what you hiding underneath (Oh-oh)
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock? (Oh-oh-oh)
Whatcha waiting for, it's time for you to show it off (Oh-oh-oh)
Don't be a shy kind of guy, I bet it's beautiful
C'mon baby, let me see...

[Refrain]
I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock-cock
(I wanna see your)
Your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock, ooh
(I wanna see your)
I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock-cock
(I wanna see your)
(C'mon, baby, let me see what you hiding underneath)

[Intro]
Yeah-eh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I can feel a Phoenix inside of me
As I march alone to a different beat
Slowly swallowing down my fear
Yeah, yeah
I am ready for the road less traveled
Suiting up for my crowning battle
This test is my own cross to bear
But I will get there

[Pre-Chorus]
It's never easy to be chosen, never easy to be called
Standing on the frontline when the bombs start to fall
I can see the heavens, but I still hear the flames
Calling out my name

[Chorus]
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?

[Verse 2]
I can feel this light that's inside of me
Growing fast into a bolt of lightning
I know one spark will shock the world, yeah yeah
So I pray for favor like Esther
I need your strength to handle the pressure
I know there will be sacrifice
But that's the price

[Pre-Chorus]
It's never easy to be chosen, never easy to be called
Standing on the frontline when the bombs start to fall
I can see the heavens, but I still hear the flames
Calling out my name

[Chorus]
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?

[Refrain]
At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?
At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?

[Bridge]
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Don't let the greatness get you down
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Don't let the greatness get you down
Oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Chorus]
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?

[Refrain]
At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?
At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?
California Girls

[Intro: Katy Perry & Snoop Dogg]
Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey
Yeah, the one, uh huh
Baby, you're a California girl

Teenage Dream

[Verse: Katy Perry]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

[Bridge: Katy Perry]
I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
You...

California Girls

[Verse: Katy Perry]
I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh
The One That Got Away

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Interlude: Katy Perry]
The one, the one, the one

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away

Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)

[Verse: Katy Perry]
There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbie's on the barbeque
This a hickie or a bruise?

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

[Chorus​​: Katy Perry]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're going to stop-op, oh whoa

[Post-Chorus: Katy Perry]
But this Friday night, do it all again
This Friday night, do it all again

[Outro: Katy Perry]
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F

E.T

[Verse: Katy Perry]
You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your loving
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

Firework

[Verse: Katy Perry]
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
C'mon, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

[Outro: Katy Perry]
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

[Verse 1]
Salvatore, you can def be my baby blue
Be my mafiosi rock 'n' roll high
Back to Malibu in our trailer park for two
We're like Sid and Nancy loving the fight

[Pre-Chorus]
We got a jumper
Got a jumper
Got a jumper
Got a jumper
My man's crazy and his mind isn't right
But I like him, fact, I love him
I can't get e-enough of him
He knows only I can save him tonight

[Chorus]
I've been waiting on your love
Baby, for too long now, too long now
I thought that I could change you like the others
But I don't know how, don't know how
It's gonna backfire
It's gonna backfire, baby
Gonna backfire, gonna backfire, baby
Told you a million times before
Yes, I'm up for it a million more

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of fighting you
Seems like everything I do
Even when I win, I lose wit' you, man
And it's not somethin' you choose
You say trouble follows you
It's been like that since the day you began

[Pre-Chorus]
We got a jumper
Got a jumper
Got a jumper
Got a jumper
I know very well you're bringing me down
I will follow, I will follow
For a little piece of heaven
I am ready, I am willing to drown

[Chorus]
I've been waiting on your love
Baby, for too long now, too long now
I thought that I could change you like the others
But I don't know how, don't know how
It's gonna backfire
It's gonna backfire, baby
Gonna backfire, gonna backfire, baby
We've done it a million times before
Yes, I'm up for it a million more

[Bridge]
We're always taking trips downtown
Officer Brown's always coming around
Tapping on our windows, "Kids, come out
Ain't no way to live, let me show you how"
But we know we're not gonna change
Keep hustlin' every night and day

[Chorus]
I've been waiting on your love
Baby, for too long now, too long now
I thought that I could change you like the others
But I don't know how, don't know how
It's gonna backfire
It's gonna backfire, baby
Gonna backfire, gonna backfire, baby
Done it a million times before
And I'll run for it a million more

[Hook: Jay Rock]
We boys in the hood
Pocket full of dubs
Homies outta line
Clip full of slugs
Baby here's my number
If you tryna fuck, baby do your thang
Shake shake it up
Sick of watts you claim, Come and give it up
Baby I'm a player, Go and hit me up
Baby do your thang
Shake shake it up, shake shake it up, shake shake it up

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
You should already know what I came for
Once the neon light hit the Top Dawg logo
See my, chain hang out
See my, wrists hang out
See my, homies hang out
They, gang bang out
West coast my state, left coast my state, you state myspace, internet gangster
You know my name baby girl no stranger
Blue Bell jeans on low cut taper
No I can't save ya
Name that captain

[?] when I'm in the Aston, Martin
So awkward when I park it
Rev up your engines, sound like it farting
I'm in the club sitting with some foreign
She don't speak English words sound retarded
We go hard in that project apartment
Five minutes in Watts, get it started

[Hook: Jay Rock]
We boys in the hood
Pocket full of dubs
Homies outta line
Clip full of slugs
Baby here's my number
If you tryna fuck, baby do your thang
Shake shake it up
Sick of watts you claim, Come and give it up
Baby I'm a player, Go and hit me up
Baby do your thang
Shake shake it up, shake shake it up, shake shake it up

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Sit back relax I'mma give you a walk through, through the city of Watts, through the city of God
Where them bitches shaking that ass, deuce deuce in they bras
Where them niggas rockin' the flash, drinkin' liquor that’s hard
Where they keep the Glock in their pants, chopper's right in the car
And if you step up on the daily's you might leave with a scar
If your gang tight might leave with a broad and like two of her friends might enjoy a ménage
And that's night life, in Watts California
Parties ain't over till like six in the morning
This Hennessey's straight, gotta nigga zoning out
Take another swig then I'm rolling out
If you ain't banging better hold your mouth
Don't claim nothing that you know you're not
So just chill, grab your bitch because life's too short
Just stick to the script

[Hook: Jay Rock]
We boys in the hood
Pocket full of dubs
Homies outta line
Clip full of slugs
Baby here's my number
If you tryna fuck, baby do your thang
Shake shake it up
Sick of watts you claim, Come and give it up
Baby I'm a player, Go and hit me up
Baby do your thang
Shake shake it up, shake shake it up, shake shake it up

[Chorus]
You bit me, bit me
Bit me, oh
You bit me, bit me
And now I want more

[Verse 1]
I'm standing in the hall, I'm puking on the wall
It's all heading south to the Conger Hill
The bangers and the mash, the negatives for cash
You're either in the club, baby, or you're not
Whatever turns you on, whatever gets you up
Chief of police or vice chancellor
Lord and Lady blah-blah, the vicar and the judge
You're all dancing to my little red book

[Chorus]
Because you bit me, bit me
Bit me, oh
I got the poison, poison
And now I want more

[Verse 2]
If you are on the top, then it is a long drop
The pyramid is power, we're changing by the hour
If you are on the top, then it is a long drop
If you stare into the dark, the dark will stare back
Back into your soul

[Laughter]

[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 3]
I'm taking you down, I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down, when I go down
I'm taking you down, I'm taking you down
I'm standing in the hall, I'm puking on the wall

[Chorus]
Yeah, because you bit me, bit me
Bit me, oh
The poison, I got the poison
I got the poison now
Yeah, I got the poison

[Verse 1]
Appliances have gone berserk
I cannot keep up
Treading on people's toes
Snot-nosed little punk

[Chorus]
And I can't face the evening straight
You can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get
Relief, relief
Relief, relief

[Verse 2]
And if I'm gonna talk
I just wanna talk
Please don't interrupt
Just sit back and listen

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't face the evening straight
You can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get
Relief, relief
Relief, relief
Relief, relief

[Outro]
It's too much, too bright, too powerful
Too much, too bright, too powerful
Too much, too bright, too powerful
Too much, too bright, too powerful

[Verse 1]
There’s a little child running around this house
And he never leaves, he will never leave
And the fog comes up from the sewers
And glows, in the dark

[Verse 2]
Baby alligators in the sewers
Grow up fast, grow up fast
Anything you want, it can be done

[Outro]
How, did you go bad?
Did you go bad? Did you go bad?
Some things will never wash away
Did you go bad? Did you go bad?

[Verse 1]
Seen all the good things and bad
Running down the hill
All so battered and brought to the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
I am hungry again
I am drunk again
With all the money I owe to my friends

[Chorus]
When I'm like this
How can you be smiling, singing?
How can you be sure?
How can you be sure?

[Verse 2]
If you walk out the door
Will I see you again?
If so much of me lies in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
I am hungry again
I am drunk again
With all the money I owe to my friends

[Chorus]
When I'm like this
How can you be smiling, singing?
How can you be sure?
(I don't want you, I don't want you)
How can you be sure?
(I don't want you, I don't want you)
How can you be sure?
(I don't want you, I don't want you)
How can you be sure?
(I don't want you, I don't want you)

[Outro]
I don't want you
I don't want you anymore
I don't want you
I don't want you anymore

[Verse 1]
Bummed out again by your only business friend
The smell of fear is thicker than you think
Don't do it, don't jump
Changed shape to fit, in the end, you just feel sick
A million love songs under anaesthetic
Hey, don’t do it, don't jump

[Chorus]
Lewis, save yourself the pain
You'll never get there
Lewis, save yourself the pain
It never really mattered

[Verse 2]
We never noticed, we never understood
He just get crushed to fit, he never even smiled at the best
It's the best, it’s the best day of your life

[Chorus]
Lewis, save yourself the pain
You'll never get there
Lewis, save yourself the pain
It never really matters
No, I swear, I swear, I swear

[Bridge]
Oh, mistreated, a low corporate
Mistreated, a low corporate

[Outro]
I don't want to talk about it
I don't want to talk about it
I don't want to talk about Lewis, Lewis, Lewis
I don't want to talk about Lewis, Lewis, Lewis

[Verse 1]
I was born
For your magazine, for your magazine
I am trapped in the society page
Of your magazines, of your magazine
I don’t know what it means

[Verse 2]
Do you see light
At the end of the tunnel? At the end of the tunnel?
Do you see light
(These are things that get on my nerves)
At the end of the tunnel? At the end of the tunnel?
(You better start naming names)
(You better start naming names)
At the end of the tunnel?
(You better start naming names)
(You better start naming names)
Tunnel
(You better start naming names)
(You better start naming names)
Tunnel
(You better start naming names)
(You better start naming names)
Tunnel
(You better start naming names)
(You better start naming names)

[Verse 1]
I mashed up a coconut outside by the back wall
Shoot my clothes on eating up my mango
Daddy was home, huntin' up the wild boar
Get your mama, quick got the polo
We had no idea we were cookin' for commando
Everybody came in 4-wheeler truckloads
Big head with players on the down low
Black coffee and fill in the info

[Hook]
And now we really rock now, we're macho
And that's what we wanted all along
Hanging up like it's the laws of our ghetto
And now we see that things are not simple

[Verse 2]
I can't have videos made by Sony, yo
Screen films of Rocky and Rambo
Role models from Hollywood to jungle
We learned to battle using our heroes
Aviator shades, no winds with the gren-ade
Hittin' that, uh camouflage and band-aid
Homemade tin weapons that ricochet
When it's hot, we all make lemonade

[Hook]
And now we really rock now, we're macho
And that's what we wanted all along
Hanging up like it's the laws of our ghetto
And now we see that things are not simple

[Verse 3]
Picked out an idiom and got my uniform
Girl gladiator, step in the stadium
One next to chick now talkin' rebellion
Cyanide pill hangin' like medallion
Picked out an idiom and got my uniform
Girl gladiator, step in the stadium
One next to chick now talkin' rebellion
Cyanide pill hangin' like medallion

[Hook ]
And now we really rock now, we're macho
And that's what we wanted all along
Hanging up like it's the laws of our ghetto
And now we see that things are not simple

And now we really rock now, we're macho
And that's what we wanted all along
Hanging up like it's the laws of our ghetto
And now we see that things are not simple

[Outro]
Ooo nana Madia sani de papaiya suni de ma

[Hook]
And now we really rock now, we're macho
And that's what we wanted all along
Hanging up like it's the laws of our ghetto
And now we see that things are not simple

[Chorus]
Blow into this paper bag
Go home and stop grinning at everyone
Blow into this paper bag
Go home and stop grinning at everyone

[Verse 1]
It was nice when it lasted but now it’s gone
It was nice when it lasted but now it’s gone

[Refrain]
Blow into this paper bag

[Verse 2]
Take your armour off, you’re not under attack
Take your armour off, you’re not under attack
Come on, come on

[Chorus]
Blow into this paper bag
Go home and stop grinning at everyone
Blow into this paper bag
Go home and stop grinning at everyone

[Verse 3]
Like they were honeybees or a plague of rats
Take your armour off, you’re not under attack

[Refrain]
Blow into this paper bag
Blow into this paper bag

[Verse 1]
I'll drown my beliefs
To have your babies
I'll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet

[Chorus]
Just don't leave
Don't leave

[Verse 2]
I'm not living
I'm just killing time
Your tiny hands
Your crazy kitten smile

[Chorus]
Just don't leave
Don't leave

[Verse 3]
And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps

[Chorus]
Just don't leave
Don't leave

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1]
If you ever need me
Just tell me, and I’ll be there
‘Cause I was built for you
Yes, I was built to carry all your feelings

[Pre-Chorus]
‘Cause I won’t let them know
I won’t let you go, baby
I don’t care what your past is
I don’t need no answers
Just have faith in me

[Hook]
Don’t you know your secret’s safe with me?
(My heart it would beat)
All your worries can be put to, can be put to sleep
(My heart it would beat)
Don’t you know your secret’s safe with me?
(My heart it would beat)
All your worries can be put to sleep
(My heart it would beat)

[Verse 2]
No need to step back
Don’t be scared, I got you, you know that
I’m here when you’re sad
When all of your clouds turn black

[Pre-Chorus]
‘Cause I won’t let them know
I won’t let you go, baby
I don’t care what your past is
I don’t need no answers
Just have faith in me

[Hook]
Don’t you know your secret’s safe with me?
(My heart it would beat)
All your worries can be put to, can be put to sleep
(My heart it would beat)
Don’t you know your secret’s safe with me?
(My heart it would beat)
All your worries can be put to sleep
(My heart it would beat)

[Verse]
Rainy day, rain all day
Ain't no use in getting uptight
Just let it groove it's own way
Let it drain your worries away, yeah
Lay back and groove on a rainy day hey
Lay back and dream on a rainy day
Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Lay back, oh yeah!

[Chorus]
Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Lay back and dream on a rainy day
Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Lay back and dream on a rainy day
Lay back and, lay back, lay back, lay back and groove
Ooh, aah!
Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Lay back and dream on a rainy day
Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Lay back and dream on a rainy day
Lay back and, lay back, lay back, lay back and groove
Ooh, aah!

Lupe: “@DonaldGlover: Lupe fiasco a ho ass nigga And wen I see him I'mma smack him like da lil bitch he is”

Been there did not do that lol

[Verse 1]
The morning is dead, and the day is too
There's nothing left here to lead me but the velvet moon
All my loneliness I have felt today
It's a little more than enough to make a man throw himself away
And I continue to burn the Midnight Lamp, alone

[Verse 2]
Now the smiling portrait of you
Is still hanging on my frowning wall
It really doesn't, it really doesn't bother me too much at all
It's just the ever falling dust that makes it so hard for me to see
That forgotten earring laying on the floor
Facing coldly towards the door

[Chorus]
And I continue to burn the Midnight Lamp, all alone
Burn!
Yeah, yeah
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Loneliness is such a drag!

[Verse 3]
So here I sit to face that same old fireplace
Getting ready for the same old explosion
Going through my mind
And soon enough, the time will tell
About the circus in the wishing well
And someone who will buy and sell for me
Someone who will toll my bell

[Chorus]
And I continue to burn the Midnight Lamp, all alone
Burn!
Yeah, yeah
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Loneliness is such a drag!

[Intro: Aziz Ansari]
I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free, Randy

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (yeah)
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (2 Chainz)
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring, dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, "Baby girl, fall in line"
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga, God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Tru)

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 2: Drake]
I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
Goddamn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
Goddamn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
"You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next, but I’m about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever
It’s not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales
I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, goddamn!

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me—

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time (Time)
Man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro sh—, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...

[Verse 4: Drake]
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section
Like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
(No more free Randy) I’m blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
'Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then, man
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do
Before I start and jump into this review I want to inform you that I wasn't a Mac Miller fan before this album dropped. Mac Miller while being one of the most successful indie hip hop artists ever, lyrically he just didn't do it for me. He just kind of reminded me of everything I wasn't really feeling about mainstream hip hop these days. Then about a month or so before the release of his sophomore effort “Watching Movies With the Sound Off” he released a couple joints before that. My ears didn't really perk up to listen until I heard “The End Is Near” first because Ab-Soul is on it, second Mac produced the joint and thirdly lyrically Mac Miller had stepped his game up. I wasn't entirely sold but I was intrigued. Next day the video for “S.D.S” came out produced by FlyLo. Mac Miller once again came correct. Lastly I saw the tracklisting and guest features on this album and I knew I had to cop it. Let's see if “WMWTSO” was enough to transform me into a fan

As I stated before I wasn't too keen on Mac Miller's catalog before this, however once this album starts it immediately grabbed my attention from the beat and the dark lyrics. “The Star Room” is the first track on the album and it's filled with a Mac reflecting on his life and how it's changing. His new found success isn't all glory, glamour and fun times and it's evident this is causing him frustration. Everything from love, to drugs is covered in this song and it's a breathe of fresh air to hear from him

A couple tracks later we get “I Am Not Real” which features Earl Sweatshirt (unfortunately only in the form of a hook) but the darkness continues on this joint. Like in “The Star Room” Mac Miller talks about more specifically about the all the bad sides about the fame that he's garnered over the years. Gold diggers, fake friends considered acquaintances, pain, drugs and more. Hearing Mac take us into the other not so glamorous side of the music business. Mac is searching for answers to a lot of questions in this album in general and he's bringing us along for his journey through life

“I Am Who I Am (Killing Time)” has Mac Miller questioning being famous but this also questioning God and religion. He feels like God has blessed by becoming famous however at the same time he wonders why God gave it to him if he's sinning. He questions those who judge him for buying material things with the money that he's making now. He feels that he almost wasting away in the studio because he spends so much time in there. The second verse takes an even darker turn with the content

Forfeit in the war, he lays a sword down and walks away
Grabs a 40 from the corner store and begins to contemplate
Dealing with death like you work in the morgue aborsving the souls
Forgotten, he lost his way
Starring down that barrel, thinking not today

Now I'll be honest the middle of the album kind of falls off a little bit for me because he seemingly goes back to the old Mac Miller that I wasn't a fan off. With songs like “Red Dot Music” (with Action Bronson), “Gees” (with ScHoolboy Q) and “Watching Movies” old fans of Mac will be pleased to see that he is in original form here and I think that's a good thing for fans to see. There's definitely maturity on this album but he sticks to his roots too

“REMember” is one of my favorite songs on the record where Mac Miller is paying homage to a fallen friend. The first verse has him talking to his friend wishing he would come back. A strong line has Mac wishing his friend had a kid so Mac could tell him/her stories about their would be father. The second first has Mac Miller telling people not to take life for granted because it can be taken from you at any moment so cherish it

The questioning of all of life's most difficult questions continues with “Aquarium”. The first verse mostly is about religion and his wanting to search for a deeper purpose in his life than what he's managing now:

"I'll always wonder what happened 3000 years ago
I like to toy with the idea that we really know
Is what I do important in the grand scheme of things?
In my head these dreams are dreamt, trust me we are kings”
The second verse is the continued questioning on life's purpose and even brings the idea that in America it almost seems like our purpose is to make money and gaining knowledge. Throughout the entire record we're witnessing a 21 year old man question the world around him from everything he's given, to everything he's earned over the years

“WMWTSO” is easily Mac Miller's best effort. One part that I skipped on the album was its production which was extremely solid. One part that I see being overlooked is how well Larry Fisherman's (aka Mac Miller) beats were on this album. This album shows that he's really put in the work on the production side of his game. Even as a whole the guest producers on the album were solid and created a cohesive sounding album (the only beat I thought that didn't really fit in was “S.D.S” but even that doesn't matter because the beat was straight fire). Lyrically Mac Miller puts everything on the line, he's questioning a lot of things and dealing with a lot of pain too

For fans of Mac Miller you might not like the change his underwent as of late, but assuming that you're fans of anyone that's featured on the project you should enjoy what Mac Miller is offering with “WMWTSO”. All the features are on point and the diversity on this project whether it be production or lyrics is good to hear from him. I am officially a Mac Miller fan, “Born Sinner” and “Yeezus” may have come out on the same day but don't sleep on this album. What ever box you had Mac Miller in before this release I can guarantee you that he breaks that box wide open during this entire album

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care 'bout is money and the city that I'm from

Yeah, I said I’m on one, fuck it, I’m on one

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Sliding with some hoes, as long as that she's 18

[Verse 4: Meek Mill]
I don’t know what these haters be talking, I pop any chick that I want
Put your girl in the back of that ‘Bach, main two reasons she ain’t gone front

But my neck and wrist so stupid, and my pockets be on so dumb
Because I’m on one
Haters we never condone em
Penthouse full of some bad bitches, me and my homies gon show em something

Ridin round in this Lambo, goin ham dog on Collins
And I’m leaning off of that purple shit, so don’t judge me like your honor
I’m feeling so cold
Yeah we riding dirty but the whip clean
But think a couple years ago
I was in a cell when I was 18
And whats up with these new bitches, and why they all wanna fuck so easy
And whats up with these new niggas, and why they all wanna talk so greasy

[Verse 5: Tyga]
All these niggas stealing swag
I've been getting tats since I was fourteen
Tell my bitch throw it in the bag
Twenty-two for the Balmain jeans
I'm smoking these niggas they needing nicotine
Rat race, first place famous like a Kennedy
All my diamonds lemonade
Hearts stay below degrees
Too many bitches marry them all, #polygamy
Make a waterfall, Yosemite
Highest underrated nigga, I don't need you rating me
Sold out shows way before this shit was BET
Knocking at my front door, bitches trying to peek and see
Last Kings, YMCMB you know the team
Just counted fifty thou in my Waldorf suite
Man, this life's too fucking easy
Ferrari red all over, call it Santa bleeding

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care 'bout is money and the city that I'm from
I'mma sip until I feel it, I'mma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it, I’m on one
Yeah, I said I’m on one, fuck it, I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and I'mma get that shit
Cause I’m on one, I said, fuck it, I’m on one

She was a little girl, picked on in school
Yeah she had funny teeth, all the kids called her toothhead
Years later when her mom got sick
She did everything she could, but momma wasn’t rich
She didn’t stop, worked 10 different jobs, yeah
That put it her through community college
Waitress, retail, hot dog on a stick
Telling herself that it won’t end like this
Now she the boss, she the boss, she the boss
You see it round her neck yeah you know what it cost
Now she the one with the smile on her face
‘Cause no one gave it to her, yeah, she earned that feeling

[Hook - Robin Thicke ]
Come on, come on
Now you feelin like a pimp, you got everything you want no wonder
Come on, come on

[Verse 2 -Robin Thicke]
And now she want to find love if she can
Somebody who can hold umbrellas in the rain
But she’s a little hardcore with the pros, it could be goodbye goodbye
Before it’s hello, hello
Before you say a word you better have a read
Standing on a mine
You could end up ooh
I’m a sometimes
But she a lifestyle
I got a big hammer but baby’s a hard rock

[Hook - Robin Thicke ]
Come on, come on
Now you feelin like a pimp, you got everything you want no wonder

Where you at? She’s on top of it
Where you at? On top of it

[Verse 3 - Robin Thicke]
Now she well paid first class top grade
Go to sleep by her self only with the front page
Dreamin of the one thing she ain’t got yet
That’s somebody to hold when the sun sets
She starts taking them pills just to feel good
It’s hard enough to be what she once was, keep it real
But she remembers how tough it was to get here
She can’t be so hard on herself yeah
You need a good time baby girl let it go
You need a good time baby girl let it go
You’re still so young good times let it go
You’re still so young good times let it go

[Hook] x3
We came so close almost
But still that's no cigar
How could our hearts beat so close
When our minds so far apart
We came so close almost

[Verse 1]
Ain't a relationship great
Look what it turn to
Is this what seven years of dedication earn you
I thought you wanted me
But you just wanna be
Up in somebody VIP where all the suckers be
Poppin bottles, Puffin weed
Guess you had enough of me
Can't make you what you don't wanna be
Luckily I recognize lies you was tellin in advance
Get another chance you do the same shit again
You better get some plans
Buckin on the system
Wonder why I'm so distant
You don't listen
Either I'm the wrong man or you the wrong Mrs
It's time to say goodbye and blow kisses
Moah

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2]
Hey I drink some muddy water
Sleep on a hollow log
Before I stay and let somebody treat me like a dog
Showed you the writing on the wall
And you tryin to blame in on another broad (NAW)
Not one of us perfect
I ain't the only one that's hurtin
We both wrong and look beneath the surface
For certain
But still ain't workin
Happiness, we both deserve it
With that said it's time to close the curtains
What's the purpose of stickin around complainin
Bout some things that'll never change
Bout each other while we suffer
Falsify everythang
I understand the circumstances
Hell I own the situation
The fed case and all the jail time a nigga facin
But you stayed down and never gave up
Remember when we used to drop top and blaze up
But them days long gone for the moment
Guess love hurts sometimes don't it

[Hook] x3

[Verse 1]
The stars are aligning
The future is bright
When I thought I’d never make it through girl
You got me right
Everytime I see you walking by
I just want to chase you round the club just like it was the first time
I still get so excited baby
I just need a taste

[Hook]
Whenever I’m feeling low
Whenever I can’t let go
Whenever I want to party
You put your lovin on me
Whenever I’m feelin crazy
Whenever the world is hating
Whenever I’m hurting baby
You put your lovin on me

That’s all I wanna do
Put your lovin on
That’s all I need from you
Put your lovin on me
That’s all I wanna do
Put your lovin on
Put your lovin on
Put your lovin on me

[Verse 2]
Dangerous body
Dangerous face
Dangerous ‘cause everybody wants some
I can’t give her no space

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Take it off
Put it on me
Do what you want
Be what you want to be

Its on you
Set it free
Do what you want
Tell me what you want to
See

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I'm America's Sweetheart
Trying to get away
You make it hard to leave
But it's easier for me to stay
I am so afraid
And I've had it up to here
With the fighting, baby, we're
Not fooling anyone these days
I don't wanna stray
But boy, I'm so afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's not love that keeps me here
And it's not what you want to hear

[Chorus]
So I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
And I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
Thought that I could make you change
I'm so afraid

[Verse 2]
We were just teenagers when we fell in love
Driving in your fast car
Looking at the stars above
But it was not enough
You should never come between
A woman and her dream
And a man that never knew his place
There's no easy way
To come back from where you came

[Chorus]
So, baby, now I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
I-I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
Nothing in your heart, boy
I thought that I could make you change
I'm so afraid

[Bridge]
And it's not love, it's just the fear
That you've put down for all these years

[Chorus]
But I'm leaving now
I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
I am done being afraid
Oh, I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
I thought that I could make you change
I'm so afraid

[Outro]
Oh, it's not love that keeps me here
It's not love that keeps me here
I'm done being afraid
I'm done being afraid
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You my Axl Rose husband
Blue hydrangea
White Pontiac heaven
Me, your red, white and blue girl
Star-Spangled danger
You my heavy metal king, king

[Verse 2]
I said, "Daddy, I need you" (Yes)
Greenwich, I need you
Strangled up in ivy
I'm the garden of Eden
Lady Liberty
Teal with flame, I'm shinin'
Queen, queen

[Bridge]
You're my one king, Daddy
I'm your little queen, red, white and blue
You're my one king, Daddy
And I'm your little queen, red, white and blue
White and blue
White and blue
White and blue

[Verse 3]
Record executive
I need you to live, I
Someone come replace you
Should I happen to meet you
Downtown or see you
I would fall down dead
I'm bereaved by you
Bereaved by you

[Verse 4]
In blue denim, I meet you
Barefoot, I need you
Diamond horseshoe sparklin'
You're my king Jewish maven
Kids on vacation
Florida Keys are callin'
"Come back to me"
"Come back to me"

[Verse 1]
You're a song
Written by the hands of God
Don't get me wrong
'Cause this might sound to you a bit odd
But you own the place
Where all my thoughts go hiding
And right under your clothes
Is where I find them

[Chorus]
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

[Verse 2]
'Cause of you
I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you
I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone
When the party's over
We will still belong to each other

[Chorus]
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

[Chorus]
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl
For being such a, ah, ah

[Bridge]
I love you more than all that's on the planet
Movin', talkin', walkin', breathin'
You know it's true
Oh, baby, it's so funny
You almost don't believe it
As every voice is hanging from the silence
Lamps are hanging from the ceiling
Like a lady tied to her manners
I'm tied up to this feeling

[Chorus]
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

[Chorus]
Underneath your clothes
Whoa-oh-oh
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl
For being such a good girl

[Verse 1]
You have to swear you've got love to love me
Uh-uh, that will last forever
Uh-uh, we must have a story
Uh-uh, with a happy ending

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ahh, so don't ever go away, and never put aside
The things I'm gonna say, ‘cause these are rules for us

[Chorus]
Use your eyes only to look at me
Use your mouth only to kiss my lips
We are branches of the same old tree
You can laugh, only if you laugh with me
You can cry, only if you cry for me
Don't forget that you're condemned to me
Oh, can't you see?
You always were, you'll always be

[Verse 2]
You used to say I should see a doctor
Uh-uh, who would keep me busy
Uh-uh, ‘cause a jealous woman never makes it easy

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ahh, and you know I'll do for us whatever seems right
Ah-ah, but it may take awhile before I change the rules

[Chorus]
Use your eyes only to look at me
Use your mouth only to kiss my lips
We are branches of the same old tree
You can laugh only if you laugh with me
You can cry only if you cry for me
Don't forget that you're condemned to me
Oh, can't you see? You always were, you always were
Ohh, oh-oh-oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
So use your eyes only to look at me
Use your mouth only to kiss my lips
We are branches of the same old tree
You can laugh only if you laugh with me
You can cry only if you cry for me
Don't forget that you're condemned to me
Oh, can't you see? You always were, you'll always be
Ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1]
So I find a reason to shave my legs each single morning
So I count on someone Friday nights to take me dancing
And then to church on Sundays
To plant more dreams
And someday think of kids
Or maybe just to save a little money

[Chorus]
You're the one I need
The way back home is always long
But if you're close to me, I'm holding on
You're the one I need
My real life has just begun
'Cause there's nothing like your smile made of sun

[Interlude]
In a world full of strangers
You're the one I know

[Verse 2]
So I learned to cook and finally lose my kitchen phobia
So I've got the arms to cuddle in when there's a ghost or a muse
That brings insomnia
To buy more thongs
And write more happy songs
It always takes a little help from someone

[Chorus]
You're the one I need
The way back home is always long
But if you're close to me, I'm holding on
You're the one I need
My real life has just begun
'Cause there's nothing like your smile made of sun

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You're the one I need
The way back home is always long
But if you're close to me, I'm holding on
You're the one I need
My real life has just begun
'Cause there's nothing like your smile made of sun
You're the one I need
You're the one I need
With you, my real life has just begun
You're the one I need
You're the one I need
Nothing like your smile made of sun
Nothing like your love
Nothing like your love, ah
Nothing like your love

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna clear the cobwebs from my head
Time will bring them back, I bet
So if you hear me say that I believe in love
Don't make me feel ashamed
I used to sing the saddest songs
And in the meantime, roaches used to climb my door
Falling back down to the floor
I used to read survival guides
When my world was full of seven legged cats
But here I am with eight more lives

[Chorus]
I'm ready for the good times
I'm ready for the good times
Ready to get it on
I'm ready for the good times
I'm ready for the good times
Now that I'm not alone
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, you know it
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
You better not ignore it

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna look at fashion magazines
While someone does my nails
Sitting here watching other people live
Frozen by the fear to fail

[Bridge]
'Cause every day there's a war to fight
And if I win or lose - nevermind
As long as you're my shelter every night
I used to cry against a wall
But now I've got a shoulder that I can lean on
Swear to me you won't be gone

[Chorus]
I'm ready for the good times
I'm ready for the good times
Ready to get it on
I'm ready for the good times
I'm ready for the good times
Now that I'm not alone

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
'Cause every day there's a war to fight
And if I win or lose - nevermind
As long as you're my shelter every night
I used to cry against a wall
But now I've got a shoulder that I can lean on
Swear to me you won't be gone

[Chorus]
I'm ready for the good times
I'm ready for the good times
Ready to get it on
I'm ready for the good times
I'm ready for the good times
Now that I'm not alone
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, you know it
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
You better not ignore it

[Verse 1: Chris Brown, Keri Hilson]
Weak, I have been crying and crying for weeks
How'd I survive when I could barely speak
Barely eat, on my knees?
But that's the moment you came to me
I don't know what your love has done to me
Think I'm invincible I see through the me I used to be

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Keri Hilson, Both]
You changed my whole life
Don't know what you're doing to me with your love
I'm feeling all superhuman, you did that to me (Oh)
A superhuman heart beats in me
Nothing can stop me here with you
Superhuman
I feel so superhuman, superhuman
I feel so superhuman, superhuman

[Verse 2: Chris Brown, Keri Hilson]
Strong, since I've been flying and righting the wrongs
Feels almost like I had it all along, I can see tomorrow
But every problem is gone because
I flew everywhere with love inside of me
It's unbelievable to see how love could set me free

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Keri Hilson, Both]
You changed my whole life
Don't know what you're doing to me with your love (To me, oh-oh)
I'm feeling all superhuman, you did that to me
A superhuman heart beats in me
Nothing can stop me here with you
Superhuman
I feel so superhuman, superhuman
I feel so superhuman

[Bridge: Chris Brown Chris Brown & Keri Hilson]
It's not a bird, not a plane
It's my heart and it's going, gone away
My only weakness is you, only reason is you
Every minute with you I feel like I can do anything
Going, going I'm gone away in love

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Keri Hilson, Both]
You changed my whole life (Oh)
Don't know what you're doing to me with your love (To me, yeah, yeah)
I'm feeling all superhuman, you did that to me
A superhuman heart beats in me (Woah, oh)
Nothing can stop me here with you
Superhuman
Superhuman

[Verse 1]
Tell me lies, slap me on the face
Just improvise, do something really clever
That'll make me hate your name forever
You might swear you'd never touch a lady
Well, let me say, you're not too far from maybe
Every day you find new ways to hurt me

[Chorus]
But I can't help it if I'm just a fool
Always having my heart set on you
'Til the time you start changing the rules
I'll keep chasing the soles of your shoes
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, fool

[Verse 2]
God resigned from hearing my old story
Every night, I'm paying hell for glory
I'm embarrassed, but I'm much more sorry
All this pain begins to feel like pleasure
With my tears, you'd make a sea a desert
Salt my wounds and I’ll keep saying, "Thank you"

[Chorus]
But I can't help it if I'm just a fool
Always having my heart set on you
'Til the time you start changing the rules
I'll keep chasing the soles of your shoes
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, fool

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
But I can't help it if I'm just a fool
Always having my heart set on you
'Til the time you start changing the rules
I'll keep chasing the soles of your shoes
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, fool
I can't help it, baby, ah-ah, fool
I can't help it, baby, ah-ah, fool
I can't help it, baby, ah-ah, fool
I can't help it, baby, baby, ah-ah-ah-ah, fool
I'm a fool
I'm a fool

[Verse 1]
You're too far to bring you close
And too high to see below
Just hanging on your daily dose
I know you never needed anyone
But the rolling papers for your grass
How can you give what you don't have?

[Pre-Chorus]
You keep on aiming for the top
And quit before you sweat a drop
Feed your empty brain with your hydroponic pot
You start out playing with yourself
You get more fun within your shell
Nice to meet you, but I gotta go my way

[Chorus]
I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain
But you're so in love with yourself
If I say my heart is sore
Sounds like a cheap metaphor
So I won't repeat it no more

[Verse 2]
I'd rather eat my soup with a fork
Or drive a cab in New York
‘Cause to talk to you is harder work
So what's the point of wasting all my words
If it's just the same or even worse
Than reading poems to a horse? Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
You keep on aiming for the top
And quit before you sweat a drop
Feed your empty brain with your hydroponic pot
I bet you'll find someone like you
‘Cause there's a foot for every shoe
I wish you luck but, I've got other things to do

[Chorus]
I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain
But you're so in love with yourself
If I say my heart is sore
Sounds like a cheap metaphor
So I won't repeat it no more

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain
If I say my heart is sore
Sounds like a cheap metaphor
I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain
But you're so in love with yourself
If I say my heart is sore
Sounds like a cheap metaphor
So I won't repeat it no more

[Verse 1]
Oh, you know I have seen a sky without sun
A man with no nation
Saints captive in chains
A song with no name for lack of imagination
And I have seen darker than ebony
And now it seems, that I
Without your eyes, could never be

[Chorus]
My one desire, all I aspire
Is in your eyes forever to live
Traveled all over the seven oceans
There is nothing that I wouldn't give
Came from Bahrein, got to Beirut
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours
Came from Bahrein, got to Beirut
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours

[Verse 2]
Oh, you know I seen a woman of means
In rags and begging for pleasure
Crossed a river of salt just after I rode
A ship that's sunk in the desert
And I have seen darker than ebony
And now it seems, that I
Without your eyes, could never be

[Chorus]
My one desire, all I aspire
Is in your eyes forever to live
Traveled all over the seven oceans
There is nothing that I wouldn't give
Came from Bahrein, got to Beirut
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours
Came from Bahrein, got to Beirut
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
رَبُّ السَّماءِ, فيك الرجاءِ
في عينيها أرى حياتي
آتِي إِلَيْكَ مِنْ هَذا الكَوْنِ
أرجوك, رَبِّي, لَبِّي نِدائي
من البحرين إلى بيروت

[Chorus]
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours
My one desire, all I aspire
Is in your eyes forever to live
Traveled all over the seven oceans
There is nothing that I wouldn't give
Came from Bahrein, got to Beirut
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours

[Verse 1]
It's not her fault that she's so irresistible
But all the damage she's caused isn't fixable
Every twenty seconds you repeat her name
But when it comes to me, you don't care
If I'm alive or dead, so

[Chorus]
Objection!
I don't wanna be the exception
To get a bit of your attention
I love you for free and I'm not your mother
But you don't even bother
Objection!
I'm tired of this triangle
Got dizzy dancing tango
I'm falling apart in your hands again
No way, I've got to get away

[Verse 2]
Next to her cheap silicone, I look minimal
That's why in front of your eyes, I'm invisible
But you've got to know small things also count
Better put your feet on the ground
And see what it's about, so

[Chorus]
Objection!
I don't wanna be the exception
To get a bit of your attention
I love you for free and I'm not your mother
But you don't even bother
Objection!
The angles of this triangle
Got dizzy dancing tango
I'm falling apart in your hands again
No way, no, no, no, no

[Bridge]
I wish there was a chance for you and me
I wish you couldn't find a place to be
Away from here
This is pathetic and sardonic
It's sadistic and psychotic
Tango is not for three; was never meant to be
But you can try it, rehearse it or train like a horse
But don't you count on me
Oh, don't you count on me, boy

[Chorus]
Objection!
I don't wanna be the exception
To get a bit of your attention
I love you for free and I'm not your mother
But you don't even bother
Objection!
I'm tired of this triangle
Got dizzy dancing tango
I'm falling apart in your hands again
No way, I've got to get away

[Outro]
Get away, get away, get away
I'm falling apart in your hands again
Get away
I'm falling apart in your hands again
Get away, get away

[Intro]
Forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who have trespassed against us
Give us this day our daily bread
Daily bread, daily bread
In cello et in terra fiat voluntas tua
Gloria Spiritui Sancto

[Verse 1]
What language do you speak
If you speak at all?
Are you some kind of freak
Who lives to raise the ones who fall?
Hey, could you tell me why
The cat fights the dog?
Do you go to the Mosque
Or the Synagogue?

[Pre-Chorus]
And if our fates have all been wrapped around your finger
And if you wrote the script, then why the troublemakers?

[Chorus]
How do you do?
How does it feel to be so high?
And are you happy?
Do you ever cry? (I sometimes cry)
You've made mistakes
Well, that's OK 'cause we all have
But if I forgive yours, will you forgive mine?

[Verse 2]
Hey, do you feel our pain
And walk in our shoes?
Have you ever felt starved
Or is your belly always full?
How many people die
And hurt in your name?
Hey, does that make you proud
Or does it bring you shame?

[Pre-Chorus]
And if our fates have all been wrapped around your finger
And if you wrote the script, then why the troublemakers?

[Chorus]
How do you do?
How does it feel to be so high?
And are you happy? Do you ever cry? (I sometimes cry)
You've made mistakes
Well, that's OK 'cause we all have
But if I forgive yours, will you forgive mine?

[Bridge]
Forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who have trespassed against us
(Sameh Zoonoobee Allah)
Give us this day our daily bread (Mechila)
Daily bread Ya Allah (S'lach lanu)
Daily bread Ya Allah (S'lach lanu)
Forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who have trespassed against us
(Sameh Zoonoobee Allah)
Give us this day our daily bread (Mechila)
Daily bread (S'lach lanu)
Daily bread
Thine is the Kingdom and the Power and the Glory
Amen!

[Chorus]
How do you do?
How does it feel to be so high
And are you happy?
Do you ever cry? (I sometimes cry)
You've made mistakes
Well, that's OK 'cause we all have
And if I forgive yours
Will you forgive mine? (Will you forgive mine?)
How do you do?
How does it feel to be so high
And are you happy?
Do you ever cry? (I sometimes cry)
You've made mistakes
And that's OK 'cause we all have
But if I forgive yours
Will you forgive mine?

[Intro]
First floor (Ah)
Room sixteen (Ah)
Smells like danger (Let's go)
Even better (Let's go)
Set your goals (Ah)
Bless our souls (Ah)
I'm in trouble (Yes, I know)
But it feels like heaven (Hey!)

[Verse 1]
You were like one of those guys
The kind with the wandering eyes
But I said, "Hey, what the hell?
Once in my life, I'll take a ride on the wild side"
You were so full of yourself
But damn, were you cute as well
You liked my legs, I liked your moves
Anyone could tell, not hard to deny that

[Chorus]
Did it again now, I got it all wrong
But it felt so right, I can't believe it
And all the mistakes that went on for too long
Wish there was a way I could delete them
Eh, eh, eh, eh, ah, ah, ah, ah
Eh, eh, eh, eh, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Interlude]
Second night (Ah), in a row (Ah), back in trouble (Let's go)
I don't get it (Let's go)
Gotta keep it down (Ah)
'Cause the lobby called (Ah)
But we ignore them (Yes, I know)
'Cause it's getting better (Hey!)

[Verse 2]
When it comes to men it's known
That I end up choosing wrong
'Cause I always trip and fall
On the same old rock and repeat and go back
How blind a girl can be
To miss you hide your ring
Lied about everything
I'm so naive and I should have known that

[Chorus]
Did it again now, I got it all wrong
But it felt so right, I can't believe it
And all the mistakes that went on for too long
Wish there was a way I could delete them
Eh, eh, eh, eh, ah, ah, ah, ah
Eh, eh, eh, eh, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Bridge]
It may seem to you that I am in a place
Where I'm losing the direction of my life
But I'm sure that this is nothing but a phase
Right back at ya, 'cause I'll survive
It may seem to you that I am in a place
Where I'm losing the direction of my life
But I'm sure that this is nothing but a phase
Right back at ya, 'cause I'll survive

[Chorus]
Did it again now, I got it all wrong
But it felt so right, I can't believe it
And all the mistakes that went on for too long
Wish there was a way I could delete them
Did it again now, I got it all wrong
Eh, eh, eh, eh, ah, ah, ah, ah
Eh, eh, eh, eh, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 1]
She's got the kind of look that defies gravity
She's the greatest cook
And she's fat free (Fat free, fat free, fat free)
She's been to private school
And she speaks perfect French
She's got her perfect friends
Oh, isn't she cool?
She practices Tai Chi
She'd never lose her nerve
She's more than you deserve
She's just far better than me
Hey, hey

[Chorus]
So don't bother
I won't die of deception
I promise you won't ever see me cry
Don't feel sorry
And don't bother, I'll be fine
But she's waiting
The ring you gave to her will lose its shine
So don't bother, be unkind

[Verse 2]
I'm sure she doesn't know
How to touch you like I would
I beat her at that one good
Don't you think so?
She's almost six feet tall
She must think I'm a flea
I'm really a cat, you see
And it's not my last life at all
Hey, hey

[Chorus]
So don't bother
I won't die of deception
I promise you won't ever see me cry
Don't feel sorry
Don't bother, I'll be fine
But she's waiting
The ring you gave to her will lose its shine
So don't bother, be unkind

[Bridge]
For you, I'd give up all I own
And move to a communist country
If you came with me, of course
And I'd file my nails so they don't hurt you
And lose those pounds, learn about football
If it made you stay, but you won't, but you won't

[Chorus]
So don't bother
I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine
Promise you won't ever see me cry
And after all, I'm glad that I'm not your type
Promise you won't ever see me cry
Don't bother
I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine
Promise you won't ever see me cry
And after all, I'm glad that I'm not your type
Not your type, not your type, not your type
Promise you won't ever see me cry

[Verse 1: Shakira]
Who would've thought that you could hurt me?
The way you've done it
So deliberate, so determined
And since you have been gone
I bite my nails for days and hours
And question my own questions on and on

[Pre-Chorus: Shakira]
So tell me now, tell me now
Why you're so far away
When I'm still so close

[Chorus: Shakira]
You don't even know the meaning of the words "I'm sorry"
You said you would love me until you die
And as far as I know, you're still alive, baby
You don't even know the meaning of the words "I'm sorry"
I'm starting to believe it should be illegal
To deceive a woman's heart

[Verse 2: Shakira]
I tried so hard to be attentive
To all you wanted
Always supportive, always patient
What did I do wrong?
Been wondering for days and hours
It's clear, it isn't here where you belong

[Pre-Chorus: Shakira]
Anyhow, anyhow
I wish you both all the best
I hope you get along

[Chorus: Shakira]
You don't even know the meaning of the words "I'm sorry"
You said you would love me until you die
And as far as I know you're still alive, baby
You don't even know the meaning of the words "I'm sorry"
I'm starting to believe it should be illegal
To deceive a woman's heart

[Guitar Solo: Carlos Santana]

[Chorus: Shakira]
You don't even know the meaning of the words "I'm sorry"
You said you would love me until you die
And as far as I know you're still alive, baby
You don't even know the meaning of the words "I'm sorry"
I'm starting to believe it should be illegal
To deceive a woman's heart

[Outro: Shakira]
Open heart, open heart
It should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart
Open heart, open heart
It should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart

[Verse 1]
Who's to say that we always have to agree
I think we can both can take this one mistake
Like some kind of amnesty
Why to love and with such brutality?
We're compatible, maybe a bit too much
That's our ambiguity
I've cried a thousand storms
I've blown away the clouds
The heartbeat of the sun is racing mine
And listen how my heart is waiting

[Chorus]
This is the day and the time
I wanna believe that we may still have a chance
We took a leap in the dark
And I can see now
How shadows have turned to light

[Verse 2]
Well, we know how ephemeral are things
Disillusion takes what illusion gives
What's the use of make believe?
The needles of the clock
Are moving right to left
Pretend we never heard of things we said
Like we've been deaf
And start all over

[Chorus]
This is the day and the time
I wanna believe that we may still have a chance
We took a leap in the dark
And I can see now
How shadows have turned to light

[Bridge]
The heartbeat of the sun is racing mine
And listen how

[Chorus]
This is the day and the time
I wanna believe that we may still have a chance
We took a leap in the dark
And I can see now
How shadows have turned to light
The time

[Verse 1]
Hold me
Show me all the talent God has given you
I want us thinking outside the box (All night long)
Just keep on going
You've done good things for me
Though I'm not an easy girl to please
I'll never run out of faith in you (All night long)
Just keep on going

[Chorus]
Long time, baby, long time
That's the way I've loved you, baby
Long night, it's been a long night
I'm breaking the record, told ya
Long time, baby, long time
The minutes are eternal lately
Long night, it's been a long night
I can't wait to touch you, touch you

[Verse 2]
I wish I had longer legs
That I could fasten to your body
So you'd take me with you everywhere
And when you think I can take no more (All night long)
Just keep on going
If I let you have your way, don't think I'm weak
You got the stamina and the technique
So let those eloquent hands of yours (All night long)
Just keep on going

[Chorus]
Long time, baby, long time
That's the way I've loved you, baby
Long night, it's been a long night
I'm breaking the record, told ya
Long time, baby, long time
The minutes are eternal lately
Long night, it's been a long night
I can't wait to touch you, touch you

[Bridge]
This thing we've got's so rare
It's so good; it's not even fair
So how could anything compare to your way?
No way
How can you do me so much good?
I'm so happy, I should get sued
But nothing matters next to you
No way, no way

[Chorus]
Long time, long time
That's the way I've loved you, baby
Long night, it's been a long night
I'm breaking the record, told ya
Long time, baby, long time
The minutes are eternal lately
Long night, it's been a long night
I can't wait to touch you, touch you

[Intro]
La la la la la lei
La la lei
La la la la la la lei
La la lei

[Verse 1]
Why do all my friends now want to be your lovers?
Your family got bigger when they thought you were rich
And now like maniacs, they scratch your back
Even when it doesn't itch

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to figure it all
I want to figure it all out
I want to save you from
Save you from all the fame
Save you from the things that cause us pain

[Chorus]
'Cause it's an animal city
It's a cannibal world
So be obedient, don't argue
Some are ready to bite you
It's an animal city, it's a cannibal world
So be obedient, don't argue
Some are ready to rip you right off

[Verse 2]
They believe you now, have everything you wanted
And once you have become a star, you've got no right to bitch
But someday when you fail, they'll put you on sale
And buy you by the inch

[Pre-Chorus]
But you're the real deal
And "real" is your middle name
You know sometimes I feel
I gotta earn every breath you take, baby
Never mind the rules we break

[Chorus]
'Cause it's an animal city
It's a cannibal world
So be obedient, don't argue
Some are ready to bite you
It's an animal city, it's a cannibal world
So be obedient, don't argue
Some are ready to rip you right off

[Bridge]
With you, I feel safe
There's nothing to fear from us
Away from the fangs, the fangs of the world
I may be a coward, but you are brave
And nothing seems so dangerous

[Chorus]
'Cause it's an animal city
It's a cannibal world
So be obedient, don't argue
Some are ready to bite you
It's an animal city, it's a cannibal world
So be obedient, don't argue
Some are ready to rip you right off
Cannibal world
Cannibal world
Cannibal world
Cannibal world
So be obedient, don't argue
Some are ready to rip you right off

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time you and I
When we were dreamin' easy
Fresh as limes and happy as a Sunday sky
There was nothing we could sell or buy
'Cause all we really needed
Was our bare feet and a pair of wings to fly

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you think, darling?
Have we lived too much, too fast?
And have you
Have you felt melancholy, darling
Wishing that time hadn't passed?

[Chorus]
Can you tell me how it used to be?
Have we missed our chance?
Have we changed our hopes for fears
And our dreams for plans?
Can you tell me how it used to be
When we really cared
And when love was on our side, on our side?

[Verse 2]
I remember all the times before
When we could spend our living
Staring at the ceiling, lying on the floor
My vocabulary wasn't broad
I spoke so little English
And the word stress would
Sound like something odd

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you think, darling?
Have we lived too much, too fast?
And have you
Have you felt melancholy, darling
Wishing that time hadn't passed?

[Chorus]
Can you tell me how it used to be?
Have we missed our chance?
Have we changed our hopes for fears
And our dreams for plans?
Can you tell me how it used to be
When we really cared
And when love was on our side, on our side?

[Bridge]
What is your guess, darling?
Have I lived too much, too fast?
So if you, if you ever come and find me crying
Now you know, now you know why

[Chorus]
Can you tell me how I used to be?
Have I missed my chance?
Have I changed my hopes for fears
And my dreams for plans?
Can you tell me how it used to be
When we really cared
And when love was on our side, on our side?

[Verse 1]
Put your trust in me
I won't let you down
Don't delay the things
That you want right now

[Pre-Chorus]
Why wait for later?
Hey, don't you want some action?
I'm not a waiter
I like to make things happen
Something's coming on, coming on strong
Don't take too long
Don't you wanna know?
Baby, come home (Oh)

[Chorus]
One more night with you
I won't think it through
Time's money, but you knew
There's nothing in the world
You can think of that I won't do to you

[Verse 2]
Drowning in your sweat
Till I drench my clothes
You've seen nothing yet
Wait till you let go

[Pre-Chorus]
Why wait for later?
Obey my intuition
We're gonna be just fine
I've got a premonition
Something's coming on, coming on strong
Don't take too long
Don't you wanna know?
Baby, come home (Oh)

[Chorus]
One more night with you
I won't think it through
Time's money, but you knew
There's nothing in the world
You can think of that I won't do to you

[Bridge]
I'm gonna dance through the veil of your eyes
While you follow my steps in the sand
I see your fate in the palm of your hand
No one looks, no one hears us this time
It's only me and your conscience tonight
If there are no witnesses, there is no crime

[Pre-Chorus]
Why wait for later?
I'm not a waiter
Something's coming on, coming on strong
Don't take too long
Don't you wanna know?
Baby, come home

[Chorus]
One more night with you
I won't think it through
Time's money, but you knew
There's nothing in the world
You can think of that I won't do to—
One more night with you
I won't think it through
Time's money, but you knew
There's nothing in the world
You can think of that I won't do to you

[Outro]
You, you
You, you
You, you
You, you
You, you

[Verse 1]
Tell me all your wishes
I am here to make them true, don't wander
You don't have to rub a lamp
'Cause I'll take care of you
Nobody knows, nobody knows
Nobody knows, nobody knows

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what you think, I'm one of your kind
You know a girl like me is difficult to find
I bet you've never seen nothing like this before
I bet you've never met someone who loved you more
You know that I'm a witch and I can read your mind, boy
Where do I have to sign? I'm on a board

[Chorus]
My new resolution is to trust you
My business to love you until you've had it
I'm not gonna miss out on the good stuff
The grass is much greener with us on it

[Verse 2]
Better than to sail on the Mediterranean Sea
Better than to get a fancy Gucci dress for free
Don't think it over, think it over
Don't think it over, think it over

[Pre-Chorus]
Totally up to you what you do with me
I'm gonna make it up to us and you will see
Don't have to prove it, it is written in your eyes
Tonight you'll be the winner, I will be the prize
You know that I'm a witch and I can read your mind, boy
I know just what you want and I like that

[Chorus]
My new resolution is to trust you
My business to love you until you've had it
I'm not gonna miss out on the good stuff
The grass is much greener with us on it

[Bridge]
Watch my body get lower
As low as it can go
All the boys will follow
I'll show you something you don't know
Watch my body get lower
As low as it can go
All the boys will follow
I'll show you something you don't know
'Cause I know what you want and I like that

[Chorus]
My new resolution is to trust you
My business to love you until you've had it
I'm not gonna miss out on the good stuff
The grass is much greener with us on it
My new resolution is to trust you
My business to love you until you've had it
I'm not gonna miss out on the good stuff
The grass is much greener with us on it

[Verse 1]
I'd like to be the kind of dream you'd never share
To be your boss and to be your maid
Your shaving cream, your razor blade
The buttons of your shirt
Your favorite underwear
I'd like to be the only thing on Earth that makes you cry
The only thing that makes you happy
Soon you will see
That no one else but me can take you this high
And soon you'll make your last name mine

[Chorus]
Hey, you
Makin' an offer that no one could ever refuse
Don't play the adamant
Don't be so arrogant
Can't you see I've fallen for ya?
Hey, you
Makin' an offer that no one would dare to refuse
Don't play the adamant
Don't be so arrogant
Let me in, let me be your muse tonight
Tonight, tonight

[Verse 2]
I'd like to be the first white hair upon your head
To be your cherry pie, your daily bread
I'll cook for free, I'll make your bed
If I can know the things you've thought and never said
I'd like to be the owner of the zipper on your jeans
And that thing that makes you happy
I'd like to be the beginning, the end
And the in-between
And be your slave, and be your queen

[Chorus]
Hey, you
Makin' an offer that no one could ever refuse
Don't play the adamant
Don't be so arrogant
Can't you see I've fallen for ya?
Hey, you
Makin' an offer that no one would dare to refuse
Don't play the adamant
Don't be so arrogant
Let me in, let me be your muse tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Hey, you
Makin' an offer that no one could ever refuse
Don't play the adamant
Don't be so arrogant
Can't you see I've fallen for ya?
Hey, you
Makin' an offer that no one would ever refuse
Don't play the adamant
Don't be so arrogant
Let me in, let me be your muse tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Let me in, let me be your muse
Be your muse tonight

[Verse 1]
Tell me what's the use
Of a twenty-four inch waist
If you don't touch me?
Tell me, what's the use again
Of being on TV every day
If you don't watch me?

[Pre-Chorus]
This house is full of emptiness
My closet's full of dresses
That I'll never wear
My life is full of people
But you're my only friend
My best friend

[Chorus]
Hope it isn't too late to say "I love you"
Hope it isn't too late to say
That without you this place looks like London
It rains every day
Don't you know it, babe?
I'm only half a body
Without your embrace

[Verse 2]
Let me tell you why
My heart is an unfurnished room
Any suggestions?
Don't have to tell you more than that
'Cause no one knows me like you do
Without exception

[Pre-Chorus]
This house is full of emptiness
My closet's full of dresses
That I'll never wear
My life is full of people
But you're my only friend
My best friend

[Chorus]
Hope it isn't too late to say "I love you"
Hope it isn't too late to say
That without you this place looks like London
It rains every day
Don't you know it, babe?
I'm only half a body
Without your embrace
Hope it isn't too late to say "I love you"
Hope it isn't too late to say
That without you this place looks like London
It rains every day
Don't you know it, babe?
I'm only half a body
Without your embrace

[Verse 1]
Told you I felt lucky with my humble breasts
Well, I don't
Said that I was sure the world was gonna change
Well, I'm not
Before I didn't give a damn 'bout what they say
But I do
Promised that I'd never ever lie to you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But look at how
I'm takin' the make-up off my face
Before I forget my own features

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not here to let you down
But the costume makes the clown
That's just life's anatomy
Don't be so hard, don't be so hard on this
It's your turn now to cheat on me

[Verse 2]
The promises I made to you went down the sink
Really hope I haven't harmed your self esteem
I'm not a virgin, but I'm not the whore you think
And I don't always smell like strawberries and cream

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So look at how
I'm takin' the make-up off my face
Before I forget who I am now

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not here to let you down
But the costume makes the clown
It's just life's anatomy
Don't be so hard, don't be so hard on this
It's your turn now, your turn now

[Chorus]
I'm not here to let you down
But the costume makes the clown
It's just life's anatomy
Don't be so hard, don't be so hard on this
It's your turn now, your turn now
To cheat on me

[Intro: Shakira & Timbaland]
How you doing?
I'm Mr. Mos, I'm back
Tim, are you on it?
Tim, are you on it?
Give me some
Is this what you wanted?
Is this what you wanted? Oh

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'm, Wayne's world
I'm the cashier, I change girls
You can go up my crane, girl
And I'ma go down that drain, girl
Hey uh, midnight cowboy
My flow is a dog, down boy
Ha, and my girl is a queen
And she do what I say and I say what I mean
Then I give it to her uncut
Shakira swing them hips like nun-chucks
Now, give it to me
I want the best and the best things in life are free

[Chorus: Shakira, Lil Wayne & Timbaland]
You can have it all
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me)
Nothing too big or small
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me)

[Verse 2: Shakira]
What you get is exactly what you give
Never really know until you try
We're so ahead of this
Got this she-wolf appetite
That keeps me up all night
You know the way it works
Don't be afraid to ask
Aim high when the target is low
F-Y-I, I am ready to go
People say men are just like kids
Never saw a kid behave like this
What you give is exactly what you receive

[Pre-Chorus: Shakira]
So put me in a cage and lock me away
And I'll play the games that you want me to play

[Chorus: Shakira, Lil Wayne & Timbaland]
You can have it all
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me)
Nothing too big or small
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me)

[Breakdown: Shakira & Lil Wayne]
Hey, can we go by walking
Or do you prefer to fly?
All of the roads are open
In your mind, in your life
Give it up to me
Hey, can we go by walking
Or do you prefer to fly?
All of the roads are open
In your life, in your life
Give it up to me

[Bridge: Shakira & Timbaland, Shakira with Timbaland]
Hey, lil lady, what's your plan?
Say lil mama, come take a ride, jump in
Hey, there, baby, what's on your mind?
Don't need approval tonight, tonight (Tonight)
Give it up

[Chorus: Shakira, Lil Wayne & Timbaland]
You can have it all
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me)
Nothing too big or small
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me)
You can have it all
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me)
Nothing too big or small
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me)

[Intro]
Quand tu
Quand tu me prends dans tes bras
Quand je regarde dans tes yeux
Je vois qu'un Dieu existe
Ce n'est pas dur d'y croire

[Verse 1]
Before I met you, I wasn't terribly lucky
Every Prince Charming lost charm after twelve
But then you came and made the past look so funny
Put my old sadness to sleep on a shelf

[Verse 2]
If this was meant to be
Don't condemn me to be free
And even if we never marry
I will always love you, baby
Childishly

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause something
You've got something I can't resist
Things are what they will be
When I look into your eyes
They say to me that God still exists

[Chorus]
And there's something
You've got something I can't resist
Things are what they will be
When I look into your eyes
They say to me that God still exists
You make me believe
You make me believe

[Verse 3]
I love the temperature and smell of your body
The shape of your lips
The size of your nose
I love that everything you say is so funny
Plus you're the best kisser that I've ever known

[Verse 4]
You see the way I am
Without make-up, without clothes
And you accept me like nobody
And I will always love you, baby
With eyes closed

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause something
You've got something I can't resist
Things are what they will be
When I look into your eyes
They say to me that God still exists

[Chorus]
And there's something
You've got something I can't resist
Things are what they will be
When I look into your eyes
They say to me that God still exists
You make me believe
You make me believe

[Bridge]
Quand tu
Quand tu me prends dans tes bras
Quand je regarde dans tes yeux
Je vois qu'un Dieu existe
Ce n'est pas dur d'y croire

[Outro]
There's something
I believe
There's something
I believe
There's something
I believe
I do
You make me believe
Je te desire

Timor, Timor
Yale, Yale
East Timor, Timor
Timor, Timor
Timor, Timor

[Break]
Going on and on and on and on
This is going on and on and on and on now
Said it once and say it twice
I want to save your time
Safety, safety

[Verse 1]
It's alright, it's alright
'Cause the system never fails
The good guys are in power
And the bad guys are in jail
It's alright, it's alright
Just as long as we can vote
We live in democracy
And that's what we promote
Isn't it? Isn't it? (Ooh)
Isn't it? Isn't it? (Ooh)
It's alright, it's alright
If the news says half the truth
Hearing what we want's
The secret of eternal youth
It's alright, it's alright
If the planet split in three
'Cause I'll keep selling records
And you've got your MTV

[Chorus]
If we forget about them, don't worry
If they forget about us then hurry
How about the people who don't matter anymore?
East Timor, Timor, Timor

[Verse 2]
It's alright, it's alright
They don't show it all on TV
So we won't really know it
Just by watching *BC
It's alright, it's alright
For our flag, we die or kill
As long as we don't know it
We'd do it just to pay the bills

[Chorus]
If we forget about them, don't worry
If they forget about us then hurry
How about the people who don't matter anymore?
If we forget about them, don't worry
If they forget about us then hurry
How about the people who don't matter anymore?
East Timor, Timor, Timor

[Bridge]
Let's keep tanning while it's sunny
They'll risk our hides to make their money
Now don't you find that funny?

[Chorus]
If we forget about them
If they forget about us then hurry
How about the people who don't matter anymore?
If we forget about them, don't worry
If they forget about us then hurry
How about the people who don't matter anymore?
East Timor, Timor, Timor
East Timor, Timor, Timor
East Timor

[Verse 1]
Broke my heart on the road
Spent the weekends sewing the pieces back on
Friends and thoughts pass me by
Walking gets too boring when you learn how to fly
Not the homecoming kind
Take the top off, and who knows what you might find
Won't confess all my sins
You can bet all trying, but you can't always win

[Chorus]
‘Cause I'm a gypsy, are you coming with me?
I might steal your clothes and wear them if they fit me
Never made agreements just like a gypsy
And I won't back down ‘cause life's already bit me
And I won't cry, I'm too young to die if you're gonna quit me
‘Cause I'm a gypsy

[Refrain]
‘Cause I'm a gypsy

[Verse 2]
I can't hide what I've done
Scars remind me of just how far that I've come
To whom it may concern
Only run with scissors when you want to get hurt

[Chorus]
‘Cause I'm a gypsy, are you coming with me?
I might steal your clothes and wear them if they fit me
I don't make agreements, just like a gypsy
And I won't back down ‘cause life's already bit me
And I won't cry, I'm too young to die if you're gonna quit me
‘Cause I'm a gypsy

[Bridge]
And I say, hey you, you're no fool if you say "no"
Ain't it just the way life goes?
People fear what they don't know
And I say, hey you, you're no fool if you say "no"
Ain't it just the way life goes?
People fear what they don't know
Come along for the ride, oh yeah
Come along for the ride, ooo

[Chorus]
‘Cause I'm a gypsy, are you coming with me?
I might steal your clothes and wear them if they fit me
Never made agreements just like a gypsy
And I won't back down ‘cause life's already bit me
And I won't cry, I'm too young to die if you're gonna quit me
‘Cause I'm a gypsy

[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
You all ready for that 

[?] experience
We got it going on the floor, man
I see everybody on the floor getting their dance on
Get your two-step on
That's my girl, you gotta find the hope
Let's go!

[Verse 1: Shakira & (Wyclef Jean)]
Slow motion, blinds are see-through (Uh-huh)
Let your mind go, imagine that I kiss you
Turn off the lights and open up your eyes now
You can take a glimpse into my soul for tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Shakira & (Wyclef Jean)]
(Do you got the heat off, girl?) Yes, I do
(Can you turn up the temperature?) You bet I could
(Colombian with a swagger) Yes, I am
Whatever it takes to make this thing work, we're gonna
Yeah (Oh yeah), yeah
Whatever it takes to make this thing work, we're gonna

[Chorus: Shakira & (Wyclef Jean)]
There's a spy by my window (Yup)
I know it's you (Uh-huh)
You like to keep an eye on me (i do)
I know you like to keep an eye on me (Oh)
There's a spy by my window
I know it's you (It's me)
Won't you like to keep an eye on me? (Uh-huh)
I know you like to keep an eye on me (I do, girl)
Keep an eye on me (Uh-huh)
But if you want it, gotta let it be, oh-oh

[Verse 2: Shakira & (Wyclef Jean)]
I know you dream about me (Uh-huh)
And it turns me on to think about it
This is the finest game
It ain't even got a name
I just wanna see how far it takes us tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Shakira & (Wyclef Jean)]
(Do you got the music on, girl?) Yes, I do
(Can you get a little closer?) You bet I could
(Colombian with a swagger) Yes, I am
Whatever it takes to make this thing work, we're gonna
Yeah (Oh yeah), yeah
Whatever it takes to make this thing work, we're gonna
Yeah (Oh yeah), yeah
Whatever it takes to make this thing work, we're gonna

[Chorus: Shakira & (Wyclef Jean)]
There's a spy by my window (Yup)
I know it's you (That's me)
You like to keep an eye on me (I do)
I know you like to keep an eye on me (Yup)
There's a spy by my window (Uh-huh)
I know it's you (It's me)
Won't you like to keep an eye on me?
I know you like to keep an eye on me (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Keep an eye on me
But if you want it, gotta let it be, oh-oh

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean]
When the dog's away, that's when the cat's play (Yeah, yeah)
You'll be my girl, I'll be the spy
Like the James Bond flick, girl, I'm ready to ride (Ride, ride)
When the cat's away that's when the mouse play (yeah, yeah)
You'll be my girl, I'll be the spy
Like the James Bond flick, girl, I'm ready to die, die, die

[Chorus: Shakira & (Wyclef Jean)]
There's a spy by my window (Yup)
I know it's you
You like to keep an eye on me
I know you like to keep an eye on me
There's a spy by my window (Yup)
I know it's you (Yup)
Won't you like to keep an eye on me?
I know you like to keep an eye on me
Keep an eye on me
But if you want it, gotta let it be, oh-oh
(OK)

[Outro: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
Wyclef, AKA Mr. Bond
Lipstick's on, stockings up
Skirt's short, heels are high
Take your time, buckle up
Close your eyes and enjoy the ride
Close your eyes and enjoy the ride
Close your eyes
Close your eyes and enjoy the ride

[Verse 1]
I think you're livin' in denial
Oh, can't you see she's pretty wild?
And every night I pray that you don't knock her up
'Cause I still want to be the mother of your child
They say "L'amour est né à Paris"
So she's planned a little trip to France
While she's in anxious anticipation
I really hope you have a horrible vacation

[Verse 2]
And so you think of me when you arrive
Hope the French fleas eat you both alive
And your room smells
And the toilet doesn't flush
And the locals treat you mean
And the service takes too long

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm fragile
And you broke my heart in two
But you just smile
Like it's all the same to you, to you

[Chorus]
When you learn your lesson
Come back like a prodigal son
And read the big sign at the airport
"Bienvenue from hell, mon amour"
When you learn your lesson
Come back like a prodigal son
And read the big sign at the airport
"Bienvenue from hell, mon amour"

[Verse 3]
Where did you get the ability
To make fake promises to me?
You are exactly like a politician
Need everyone's approval just to see if you're doing right

[Verse 4]
And I hope you freeze under the Eiffel Tower
So you end up throwing in the towel
Hope you'll miss me
And someday you're gonna see
That I put my trust in you
But you turned your back to me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm fragile
And you broke my heart in two
But you just smile
Like it's all the same to you, to you

[Chorus]
When you learn your lesson
Come back like a prodigal son
And read the big sign at the airport
Bienvenue from hell, mon amour
When you learn your lesson
Come back like a prodigal son
And read the big sign at the airport
"Bienvenue from hell, mon amour"

[Breakdown]
What's your destination?
What's your destination?

[Chorus]
When you learn your lesson
Come back like a prodigal son
And read the big sign at the airport
"Bienvenue from hell, mon amour"
When you learn your lesson
Come back like a prodigal son
And read the big sign at the airport
"Bienvenue from hell, mon amour"
Mon amour, mon amour

[Outro]
Passengers with destination
Passengers with destination
Passengers with destination to hell
Please proceed to your gate, we are ready to board now

(Oh) Beyoncé, Beyoncé
(Oh) Shakira, Shakira
Hey!

[Verse 1: Beyoncé, Shakira]
He said I'm worth it, his one desire
I know things about 'em that you wouldn't want to read about
He kissed me, his one and only (Yes), beautiful liar
Tell me how you tolerate the things I just found out about

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé, Shakira]
You never know
Why are we the ones who suffer?
I have to let go
He won't be the one to cry

[Chorus: Beyoncé, Shakira, Both]
(Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
(Oh) Can't we laugh about it? (Ha, ha, ha!)
(Oh) It's not worth our time
(Oh) We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar

[Verse 2: Beyoncé, Shakira]
I trusted him, but when I followed you, I saw you together
I didn't know about you then 'till I saw you with him again
I walked in on your love scene, slow dancing
You stole everything, how can you say I did you wrong, yeah?

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé,  Shakira]
We'll never know
When the pain and heartbreak's over
I have to let go
The innocence is gone

[Chorus: Beyoncé, Shakira, Both]
(Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
(Oh) Can't we laugh about it? (Ha, ha, ha!)
(Oh) It's not worth our time
(Oh) We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar

[Bridge: Beyoncé, Shakira, Both]
Tell me how to forgive you (Ooh)
When it's me who's ashamed (Oh)
And I wish could free you
Of the hurt and the pain
But the answer is simple
He's the one to blame, hey!

[Break: Beyoncé]
(Ay) Beyoncé, Beyoncé
(Ay) Shakira, Shakira
(Oh) Beyoncé, Beyoncé
(Oh) Shakira, Shakira
Hey!

[Chorus: Beyoncé,  Shakira, Both]
(Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
(Oh) Can't we laugh about it? (Ha, ha, ha!)
(Oh) It's not worth our time
(Oh) We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, oh
(You know, I've never felt like this before) Oh, oh
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, oh
(This feels, like, so real) Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive, just one thought ain't close enough
You got me stressin', incessantly pressin' the issue
'Cause every moment gone, you know I miss you
I'm the question and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close, boy, 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken, I'm never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me callin' out for help

[Chorus]
S-O-S, please, someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are makin' this hard
I can't take it, see, it don't feel right
S-O-S, please, someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are makin' this hard
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night

[Post-Chorus]
This time, please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testin' me, but still, I'm losin' it
This time, please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losin' it

[Verse 2]
Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes, it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots and when I see you, it gets so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me (Uh-huh), you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight
I melt with you, you got me head over heels (Over heels)
Boy, you keep me hangin' on, the way you make me feel

[Chorus]
S-O-S, please, someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are makin' this hard (Y-O-U are)
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night

[Post-Chorus]
This time, please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it ('Cause you on my mind)
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testin' me, but still, I'm losin' it
This time, please, someone come and rescue me (Someone come and rescue me, yeah)
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losin' it

[Bridge]
Boy, you know you got me feelin' open
And boy, your love's enough with words unspoken
I said, boy, I'm tellin' you, you got me open
I don't know what to do, it's true
I'm goin' crazy over you, I'm beggin'

[Chorus]
S-O-S, please, someone help me (Somebody help me, yeah)
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are makin' this hard (Why you makin' this hard for me, baby?)
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night (Ooh)

[Post-Chorus]
This time, please, someone come and rescue me (Someone rescue me)
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testin' me, but still, I'm losin' it
This time, please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it (All of the time)
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losin' it (Best of me, I'm losin' it )

[Verse 1]
I don’t know what to say
Everything is wrong
I can’t believe that I was so blind
Once again I lost my way
I know that you’re gone
All I want is what I strived

I know I hurt you deep inside
Maybe you can’t forget the lies

But I can’t hide my tears
I don’t want to lose you
I know that in my heart
You still feel the same way too

I said so many things before
Never stopped to think
So please to try to understand

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I hurt you deep inside
(I know I hurt you deep inside)
Maybe you can’t forget the lies

[Chorus]
So I am here, all alone
I can’t let go
And the circles of my mind
And my heart’s spinning round like
I just made the bridges fall
I can’t go on
Without your love
I’m gone crazy
Never stopped loving you
But the writing's on the wall

[Verse 2]
I don’t want to cry anymore

The letters that I wrote
I could never send
I was just a fool, you see
I know you trusted me
I was just so weak
No I’m guilty for your pain

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So I am here, all alone
I can’t let go
And the circles of my mind
And my heart’s spinning round like
I just made the bridges fall

I can’t go on
Without your love
I’m gone crazy
Never stopped loving you
But the writing's on the wall

If you want me back in your life
I should be here if you want to try
Yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Oh why you look so sad
Tears are in your eyes
Come on and come to me now
Don’t be ashamed to cry
Let me see you through
Cause I’ve seen the dark side too

When the night falls on you
You don't know what to do
Nothing you confess
Could make me love you less

[Chorus]
I’ll stand by you
I’ll stand by you
Won’t let nobody hurt you
I’ll stand by you

[Verse 2]
So if you're mad get mad
Don’t hold it all inside
Come on and talk to me now
Hey, what you got to hide
I get angry too
Well I’m a lot like you
When you're standing at the crossroads
And don't know which path to choose
Let me come along
Cause even if you're wrong

[Chorus]
I’ll stand by you
I’ll stand by you
Won’t let nobody hurt you
I’ll stand by you
Take me in into you darkest hour
And I’ll never desert you
I’ll stand by you

[Bridge]
And when, when the night falls on you, baby
You feeling all alone
You won't be on your own

[Chorus]
I’ll stand by you
I’ll stand by you
Won’t let nobody hurt you
I’ll stand by you
Take me in into you darkest hour
And I’ll never desert you
I’ll stand by you
I’ll stand by you
I’ll stand by you
I’ll stand by you
I’ll stand by you
And I’ll never desert you
I’ll stand by you
I’ll stand by you
And I’ll never desert you
I’ll stand by you

Loca (Loca)
Loca
Dance or die
Loca (Loca)

[Verse 1: Shakira]
She's playin' dumb all the time, just to keep it fun
To get you on like, "Ahh!" Be careful, amigo
She's talking and walking just to wake you up
She'd die for your love, but your love's only mine, boy
Yo sigo tranquila, like I'm on a beach in Anguilla
Sippin' my Corona like it's nothin' goin' on
I ain't leavin' you alone, what is meant for me
No other girl is gonna take it, so give him up

[Chorus]
And I'm crazy, but you like it, loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain't easy, loca, loca, loca
I'm crazy but you like it, loca, loca, loca
Crazy but you like it

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
That girl is a nutter
Hot girl, I heat up when I touch her
Chica Caliente, got me rapping to merengue
I feel so el presidente
I'm runnin' shit and I'm lovin' it
She's got a mean lil' bopper, you should see what she does with it
She keeps it down low (Down low, down low)
I can never get enough, oh no, oh no
She gives me the runaround, but I stay chasin'
But I mean, yo, I'm in love with a crazy girl
But it's all good, and it's fine by me
Just as long as I hear her say, "Ay, papi"

[Chorus: Shakira, El Cata]
And I'm crazy, but you like it, loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain't easy, loca, loca, loca
I'm crazy but you like it, loca, loca, loca
Crazy but you like it (Loca, loca, loca)

[Interlude]
You're the one for me, and for her no more
Though you think she got it all, I got my kiki
You're the one for me, and for her no more
Though you think she got it all, I got my kiki

[Verse 3: Shakira, Dizzee Rascal & El Cata]
I guess she doesn't know the things that I’d do to please you
I take you to the malecón por el caminito
They saw your girlfriend looking for me with a rifle
'Cause, we’re dancin' Mambo, oh, what she don't allow it?
I really can't help it if I make the lady loca
I don't want no trouble, I just wanna hit the- ooh!
And I'm crazy, but you like it
'Cause the kinda girl like me, they're running out of in the market
(Shhh)

[Chorus]
And I'm crazy, but you like it, loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain't easy, loca, loca, loca
I'm crazy but you like it, loca, loca, loca
Crazy but you like it

[Pe-Chorus: Shakira & Dizzee Rascal]
¡Dios mío!
That girl is a (Loca)
That girl is a (Loca)
That girl is a (Loca)
It's a madness
Pure madness
Loca
That girl is a (Loca)
That girl is a (Loca)

[Interlude]
You're the one for me, and for her no more
Though you think she got it all, I got my kiki

[Chorus / Outro]
And I'm crazy, but you like it, loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain't easy, loca, loca, loca

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
This is my story, yeah, I'm from that Chi-town dirt
I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts
This is my story - money, cars, bad hoes
This is my story-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y
And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it
And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it

And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Came from humble beginnings now I'm cocky with my spending
They say "life is just a game" and I thank God that I'm winning
Models roll my indo, I beat the pussy, Django
Them niggas talking money, I got more digits in my gate code
She make a pole disappear like hocus pocus
You're ain't never gon' find another nigga this focused
I got every block, every street corners sold up
Whatever club represent my city, throw it up
I own the game, coach last player shown up
Okay, haters throw fitted never showed up

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
This is my story, yeah, I'm from that Chi-town dirt
I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, 2 Chainz...
Velcro, I'm sticking to it, hatin', I've been a victim to it
Your conversation is sanitation, ain't no hesitation when I finna do it
I stick it in (uh) switch it up and try to hit a friend (uh)
Live it up and count my dividends, roll, like cinnamon
Woah, big face Benjamin's
As she lookin' at me like ye'en ain't nothin' but a star
I looked at her like this ain't nonthing but a car
If you ride with them you ain't going that far
But if you ride with me, crib so big we can play hide-and-seek
You can confide to me, ride me like I ride the beat
Pilot seat, I need a co-pilot, kiss a ass in both mouths
Them talking both lips, what you know 'bout boat trips?
Drop her ass at the Chocolate Factory (yeah)
We did them 12 Play's (yeah)
And you know who you is girl
We been fuckin' since the 12th grade, goddamn

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
This is my story, yeah, I'm from that Chi-town dirt

And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Pull up to the club at about three
I'm killin' it, guilty no plea
I'm leaving out at 6 with a dime piece
By 9 o'clock, we on round three
I speak of rain they say I'm crazy like they didn't know
See I'm not crazy but my talent, man, got bipolar
Say she's a church girl but man she's blowing holy smokes
Showed her the Jesus piece now she got the Holy Ghost
They asked them in a interview, "why do he love these girls?"
The only thing he had to say was, "motherfuck the world!"

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
This is my story, yeah, I'm from that Chi-town dirt
I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts
This is my story - money, cars, bad hoes
This is my story-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y
And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it
And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it
And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it
And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it

[Verse 1]
There must have been an angel by my side
Something heavenly led me to you
Look at the sky
It's the colour of love
There must have been an angel by my side
Something heavenly came down from above
He led me to you
He led me to you

[Bridge]
He built a bridge to your heart
All the way
How many tonnes of love inside?
I can't say

[Verse 2]
When I was led to you
I knew you were the one for me
I swear the whole world could feel my heartbeat
When I lay eyes on you
I-I-I-I-I
You wrap me up in
The colour of love

[Chorus]
You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life
You gave me the kiss that's like
Kiss of life

[Saxophone Solo]

Wasn't it clear
From the start?
Look the sky is full of love
Yeah the sky is full of love

He built a bridge to your heart
All the way
How many tonnes of love inside?
I can't say

[Chorus]
You gave me the kiss of life

Giving me love, yeah

[Verse 1: Bret McKenzie]
Inner city life, inner city pressure
The concrete world is starting to get ya
The city is alive, the city is expanding
Living in the city can be demanding
You've pawned everything, everything you own
A toothbrush jar and a camera-phone
You don't know where you're going
You cross the street
You don't know why you did
You walk back across the street
Standing in the sitting room, totally skint
And your favorite jersey is covered in lint
You want to sit down, but you sold your chair
So you just stand there
(You just stand there)

[Verse 2: Jemaine Clement]
Counting coins on the counter of the 7/11
From a quarter past six 'til a quarter to seven
The manager, Bevin, starts to abuse me
"Hey man, I just want some muesli"
Neon signs, hidden messages
Questions, answers, fetishes
You know you're not in high finance
Considering secondhand underpants
Check your mind, how'd it get so bad?
What happened to those other underpants you had?
Look in your pockets, haven't found a cent yet
Landlord's on your balls, "Have you paid your rent yet?"

So you think, "Maybe you'll be a prostitute"
Just to pay for your lessons, you're learning the flute
Ladies wouldn't pay you very much for this
Looks like you'll never be a concert flutist

[Verse 4: Bret]
You don't measure up to the expectation
When you're unemployed there's no vacation
No one cares, no one sympathizes
You just stay at home and play synthesizers

[Verse 1]
Sell me candy like it’s summer when it’s melting in my hands
I know you’re around like the ice cream man
I can hear you calling, whisper something in my ear
You're sweet like sugar, tell me what I wanna hear
I’m weak by your touch and when it’s melting on my lips
I run through my body when you lick my fingertips
You’re selling me a fantasy that I wanna explore
It sounds so good, spoil me rotten to the core

[Chorus]
Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It’s destiny, just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What’s the charge? What’s the cost?
(I’m the daddy) You the boss

[Verse 2]
You could be a professional, boy, you make a sale
I try to resist, but every time I fail
The one temptation that I gotta endure
The running through my body, now you’re knocking at my door
A thin little kiss and your call is really sweet
But the shawty that you’re rocking is nothing like me
You’re selling me a fantasy that I wanna explore
It sounds so good, spoil me rotten to the core (You know)

[Chorus]
Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It’s destiny, just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What’s the charge? What’s the cost?
(I’m the daddy) You the boss

[Verse 3]
I wanna play, more than you know
So don’t you leave, and don’t you go
I want it all, until time falls
His arms, I want to roam
I wanna love, give him my trust
I wanna live, for both of us
I wanna breathe you, lay on your shoulder
I wanna warm you when nights get colder
I want love, love, love
I want love, love, love

[Chorus]
Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It’s destiny, just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What’s the charge? What’s the cost?
(I’m the daddy) You the boss
Scratch the nape, just like a snake
I will shake the scales and dry self I have been dragging
And I'll walk into the sun
And I won't bite my thumb
If the splendor ruptures, I'm gonna take it as it comes

[Chorus 1]
Lurch, murky depth can tear your heart cruel
Deep calls to deep, a chance to sift through
Harsh may burn you love to seek truth
Shed a new view

Lurch, murky depth can pull you under
Deep calls to deep raucous as thunder
Shake the wonder, prey to other
Oh, we melt hearts a flutter
Ahhhhhh..
Ahhhhhh...
Ahhhhhhhhhh...
Ahhhh...ahhhhhh..ahhhhhhhhhhh..
A new stain etches through the veins
A small grace bathed in old refrain
Stretch the frame a little further
This aria will play again
Come now shiver through the soft aching jasmine ribbon around your claws
Rambles through the heart eons that dart
But never part
Now I finish the morning spark

[Chorus 1]
Lurch, murky depth can tear your heart cruel
Deep calls to deep, a chance to sift through
Harsh may burn you love to seek truth
Shed a new view
Yiyayiyayahhh..
Ahhhh...
Ahhhhh...
Ahhhhhhhhh....ahhhhhhh...ahhhhhh..

My love, my love, my love

Scratch the nape, just like a snake
I will shake the scales and dry self I have been dragging
Malika, my soul sweetener
Malika, my soul sweetener
My soul sweetener, my soul sweetener
My soul sweetener

[Verse 1]
The mirror's image tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin'
Carryin' your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreamin'
Of bumpin' into you

[Chorus]
Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply
"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"
"High, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

[Verse 2]
Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite
I need a partner, well are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of makin' alright decisions
And having bad ideas

[Chorus]
Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply (Message, you reply)
"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"
(Why'd you only call me when you're)
"High, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

[Bridge]
And I can't see you here, wonder where I might
It sort of feels like I'm runnin' out of time
I haven't found all I was hopin' to find
You said you got to be up in the mornin'
Gonna have an early night
And you're startin' to bore me, baby
"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"

[Outro]
"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"
"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"
"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"
"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're (high)?"
I'm a buffalo soldier, a buffalo soldier
I walk around in this world with my gun out the houlster
All the way to my soldiers, but fuck it I hold up
Fuck the world for what it's worth until this bitch over
But I don't wanna grow up, but I only get older
The world getting colder, my heart is all froze up
I wear it on my sleeve, but i keep my sleeve's rolled up
I be on my work like the dealer is coked up
I been on the search for whoever is so tough
Forever is so much, I hope it don't slow up
I hope that it last you everyday like the sure one
And stand in that motherfucking heat 'til the storm come
I'm living like Bear Gryll's, Man VS Wild
Take no demands where I stand, no help planning it out
I do this shit for myself, can't understand it, then fuck you
Do what the fuck you want, cause either way they gon' judge you
Stay inside your lane and watch the stars from the sunroof
Believe it in your brain, it will possibly come true
Sound corny as fuck, but I ain't tellin' lie
I'm just telling you exactly what I see with my eye's
One of the illest alive, woooop

[Verse 1]
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away
By golly, what more can I say?
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day

[Verse 2]
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright
Man, that girl is out of sight
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night

[Bridge]
Well, ya' know that even before I learned her name
Ya' know I loved her just the same
And I tell ’em all, wherever I may go
Just so they’ll know, that she my little lady
And I love her so

[Verse 3]
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away
Turned my skies to blue from gray
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day

Love to spend the night with Peggy Day
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day

[Intro: Future]
It ain't nothin' for me to ball on you
It ain't nothin' for me to spoil you
If I adore you, I'ma give you that theory
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I wanna be where the commas will be
But I need a hood nigga with the llama degree
Get the limited edition, Audemars, it could be
In a pivotal position, gotta pardon the fee
'Cause he bought a couple bags and he sent a couple whips
And he took a couple trips, then it's dinner and a Myx
And he's never with no other chick, fronting like he's slick
'Cause it's levels to this shit, and she could never be Nic
Niggas be fallin' in love with this pussy
Mean stew chicken, and bake him a couple of cookies
Dick on veteran, ain't fucking with rookies
Saw the High School video now he wanna play hookie
Baddest bitch, I'm the catalyst
Ain't never been done, bitch I added this
Nah, I ain't gotta shoot, I got mad assists
'Bout to put a couple pieces on the mannequin
Got a big billboard out in Madison
At the Trump, and you bitches at the Radisson
Got the .22 on me, and it's thin
Shoot movies, Jennifer Aniston

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You decide you'll be mine you can come inside
You the type that can make me prioritize
Hittin' my phone, it's alright
Hittin' my phone, it's alright
You reply, what's your sign? You're a Gemini
You deny that you're shy, maybe we should slide?
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, baby

[Chorus: Future]
Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy
Buyin' purses too easy, payin' bills too easy
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy
Buyin' cars too easy, poppin' bottles too easy
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
Everything you do is brand new

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Make that bad bitch my shorty, hit the club, throw forty
My hat bent like 'Uhh!', my chain drip like water
Car paint like tar, I'ma sex her harder
Bitch let go my hand gave you the keys as soon as I bought it
Voom, voom, oh yeah, big bank, I'm too real
My money right in them boys you with be dead broke, two years
Checked it, look her, you ain't even know, big deal
On site, act right, I shop hard, pack light
That ho chick gets you no play, all I talk is cocaine
White tee and these rope chains, blow the roof back - Kurt Cobain
Phantom cost like four dollar, flo' seats, hoes holla
Underground with this pimp shit so smoke one for Port Arthur

[Chorus: Future]
Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy
Buyin' purses too easy, payin' bills too easy
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy
Buyin' cars too easy, poppin' bottles too easy
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
Everything you do is brand new

[Outro: DJ Khaled & (Future)]

[Intro]
Um......'Sup, cock fucking face niggas?
It's your boy Ace, man. Um.....
I'm in fucking Sacramento right now and shit, mom just moved
I've got nothing better to do out here, so I'm just gonna freestyle for you dick sucking motherfuckers, alright?
Ready? Who you with? Nah, I'm playing.......um.....
Alright, let's see.......
This some exclusive shit, nigga. Um.....
I'm really gonna freestyle, none of this shit written like these other
Motherfuckers do. Alright?

[Verse]
Free styling, and that nigga Wild N' Out, like Nick Cannon. Fuck on rock or bammin' Obama
I'mma fuckin' bomb ya. Have to be something with your mamma and Osama
Bin Laden, that nigga been hidin'. Probably been ridin' in the dirty
Eating on my dad's white stuff, like Mcflurry
Nigga's can't burn me. I am not a book, you can't learn me
But don't fuck me, you cannot yearn me. I am not a fucking check, you cannot earn me
What the fuck else rhymes with earn? Bernie
Bernie and irk, irk and Kirk, and Kirk is fucking Berk and Berk is fucking Bobby
Bobby's fucking auntie, Johnny. Johnny fucking nanny, auntie. Johnny's fucking Chuck, and Chuck is fucking Bobby
So, it's like a threesome, with eighteen more fucking people
I'm a fucking zero, your a fucking two plus eight, six. I can't count, that's why I won't amount to shit
But I got a big dick, and it's growing. And my fucking lyrics keep flowing
And my mother fucking spit keep getting on my fucking clothes and the camera
Lens. I am in the mother fucking camera bends
I don't make sense, but I could give a damn if your bitch is a man. If your mother fucking head hurt from working all day
If your momma's dead, she be sucking dick and fucking pussy blunt ashtrays with your uncle
Fuck 'em, fuck you. If you looking at this, fuck you
Here, you is a mother fucking queer
Shout out to Odd Future, Peas 'n Carrots. We gon sit down and say cheers. I just though of that right now
Actually, I thought about that two minutes ago. We can go find a ho, or a slut, or a bitch, open up her legs and probably bust a nut in her hair
Spit up on the lens, lens up on the spit. This camera's shit
Hopefully, some nigga's will get me a cannon
Back to my first line, bammin Obama. Fuck you and your fucking momma
And your momma's cousin, they be buzzing, they be smoking, and then they coke, and then they drink, and then they play Young dro in a Lincoln. I'm winking
I'm lying, and your bitch is lying. Because the bitch got shot, and her fucking mom's dying
No, she's not dying, I'm lying. Her fucking uncle bobby just got shot with a BB......Gun, nigga's better run
My dick's a gun, and it's about to cum. Blow you in your mouth, yeah, I blow it in your mouth
Get it? No, you don't. Yes, you will, no, I won't
Fuck, I'm running out of breath. Need a fucking, inhaler before I fucking, inhale ya
This shit is recording, now I gotta save you like I'm jesus Christ, but I'm not
And hopefully the nigga behind me don't have a knife. I'm home alone, and I got my own bone, this is my own song
Actually, I'm going home tonight. Actually, I'm lying, I ain't right. Yep, yeah, eah
No, I'm going theres, to the house

[Final verse]
I'm from Hawthorne, the dirty dirty. Where niggas get stabbed up, where niggas get rabbed up in rasbeads
And when I say rasbead, nigga's get raped. No homo, we're not fruity, we're not rasbead
We're the other b2k members. We're not fucking white winter, like December. We're low so, like fall in like September, or October, or November
I thought I told you, fuck. I'm sick of fucking rapping, I'm sick of fucking clapping, for you mother fuckers that's rapping
Saying that I freestyle, bring the pain. Nigga, this is not a freestyle. I'm not stupid, your not Lil Wayne
These nigga's say, fuck I'm not gonna get up into it. Because these wallet chain niggas gonna get me into it, and I'm a say screw it, but I'm not gonna chop
But I'm not Mike Jones, and I'm not Mike Jones, Mike Jones. Who? Shut the fuck up
Here's a dick, dad, you can suck up. But actually, I don't give a fuck up
I'mma a be a man about it and hopefully, suck it up. I'm talking about your dick, fuck it. You love it, no, you fucking hate it
And you fucking rate it, and degrade it, and discard it. Fuck it, I'll catch you niggas tomorrow
Odd Future. Happy Days. Bicano, and Casey Veggies. My nigga K Mac, shout to Left Brain, and my nigga Jerry, and my ex girlfriend, bitch buried. Shout out to Ology, teen blocks coming up
Cheers, busting in your ears

[Outro]
What else, did not fucking shout out? That's probably the only nigga's on MySpace I like
Oh, fuck it. The beat's coming bac- Nah, I'm playing, I'm so sick of this shit
I'll see ya'll nigga's later

[Intro: B.o.B]
Autotune! (8x)

[Hook: B.o.B]
Well, I was in the studio
But I couldn't hit the notes
I could've got a vocal coach
But I ain't want no vocal coach
Then someone showed me this plug-in
So you can't hear the notes I miss
So I don't need no vocalist
And now I got an instant hit

[Verse: B.o.B]
Wassup baby?
When I come through, I'm a boss
Everything I do I just floss
And you know what I'm doing
When I do it, everything I do is just real
And you know I ain't playing, I'm just saying man
Everything in my brain is playing
When I'm on the mic I'm blazing
Man who am I? Just like a super-saiyan
Man I'm just saying
When I'm in the booth man, I'm never, never playing
And let me just quit it
When I'm on the mic, these lyrics I kick it
And it's so exquisite
Man I divide up just like digits
May I get a witness
All up in church on sunday man, give it

[Hook: B.o.B]
Well, I was in the studio
But I couldn't hit the notes
I could've got a vocal coach
But I ain't want no vocal coach
Then someone showed me this plug-in
So you can't hear the notes I miss
So I don't need no vocalist
And now I got an instant hit

[Outro: B.o.B]
Thanks Autotune!

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you about a girl I know
She's my baby, and I love her so
And every morning when the sun comes up
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I love her so

[Verse 2]
When I call her on the telephone
She says, "Baby, I'm all alone"
Before the time I count from one to four
She'll be knocking on my door

[Verse 3]
Every evening when the sun goes down
And there ain't nobody else around
She kisses me and then she holds me tight
"Hey baby, everything's alright"
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I love her so
Hallelujah, I love her so
Hallelujah, I just love that chick so

[Verse 1]
Just wanna taste the kiss
And you the girl that's got my heart in this
And it's no way you can get away with it
You need to come sit down, listen to what I gotta say
I need one more fantasy
All I see is you've been dreamin'
Girl, you making sweet love to me
And I can't help that I'm impatient, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I'm right where I wanna be
Girl, we ain't never finished
I'm tryna make love for eternity
So baby, just sit me where you want me
Please fuck me forever
In the sheets, baby, pillow fight
We gon do it all night

[Chorus]
I'ma make you cry a little bit
Girl, I know that you're a freak
I'ma make you ride, hop on me (Hop on me)
Follow me, little lady, right to the fuckin' bedroom
Body rubbing all on me
When we in the bedroom
The way you do that, girl, you remind me of something
Let me sex you up, when we in the bedroom, sex you up

[Verse 2]
And girl, I only wanna love you, baby
So write your name on the dotted line
Girl if you shy, you don't have to be ashamed
Baby, I won't yell until you yell
Just lay your head down
I'ma put this love on you
I'ma show you just what you want me to
I'm not going nowhere, not going nowhere

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I'm right where I wanna be
Girl, we ain't never finished
I'm tryna make love for eternity
So baby, just sit me where you want me
Please fuck me forever
In the sheets, baby, pillow fight
We can do it all night

[Chorus]
I'ma make you cry a little bit
Girl, I know that you're a freak
I'ma make you ride, hop on me (Hop on me)
Follow me, little lady, right to the fuckin' bedroom (Follow me, follow me)
Body rubbing all on me
When we in the bedroom (When we in the bedroom)
The way you do that, girl, you remind me of something
Let me sex you up, when we in the bedroom, sex you up

[Bridge]
Girl, I'm sitting here, waiting alone for you
And you got what I need
Girl, I'ma take it slow, take it nice and slow
Come on baby
Your dreams will come true for the night
And we're on this magic mountain
I hope you're ready to climb

[Chorus]
I'ma make you cry a little bit
Girl, I know that you're a freak
I'ma make you ride, hop on me (Hop on me)
Follow me, little lady, right to the fuckin' bedroom
Body rubbing all on me
When we in the bedroom
The way you do that, girl, you remind me of something
Let me sex you up, when we in the bedroom, sex you up
i can’t save the world. my sun will die eventually. one convenient part of being creative and well-resourced in life though, is that you can make a point to never be bored. oh and you can seclude yourself from the voices of fools. if you love me… when i’m done, let me vibrate in peace.

[Verse 1]
There's no one inside
But you're free to relax
If you commit to this ride
There's no turning back
You've been here before
Remember these sheets?
This world's not for us
It's not what it seems

[Bridge]
You'll learn to love how to dream, dream
You'll learn to love how to dream, dream

[Verse 2]
There's no need to hide
Don't overreact
You said you've been to the sky
We'll go beyond that
You've been here before, girl
Remember these sheets
This world's not for us
It's not what it seems

[Bridge]
You'll learn to love how to dream, dream
You'll learn to love how to dream, dream
I could teach you to dream, oooh

[Hook]
We'll find our love in the sky
We'll find our love in the sky
We'll find our love in the sky
We'll find our love in the sky
We'll find our love in the sky
We'll find our love in the sky

[Verse 3]
How does it feel?
Do you feel like you did before?
Do you see the world getting small?
How does it feel, are you free?
As for me, I've been getting grown
As for me, I've been getting old
As for me, I’ve been flying around the world
I’ve been killing these shows
But I'm always getting high
Cause my confidence low
And I'm always in a rush
Ain't no time to fuck slow
And even if I try
It's not something I would know
But I'm sure I'll make you cum
Do it three times in a row
And I'm sure you would have left
Put that pussy in control
Got that pussy in control
I got it in control
Control, control, control

[Outro]

[Intro: Flo Rida]
Damn, that white girl got some ass!

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
I can't believe it
White girl got some ass, I wanna see it
Black girl got a ass, it ain't a secret
Baby, turn around, I wanna see it
Tryin' to see it, gotta see it
I wanna see that
Bubble yum bum
Badum-bum badum
Bubble yum bum
Badum-bum badum

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Ooh, I think I found one
Cause I got that fever, look
Britney got herself a round one
Ass like Serena, that's okay
Cause I love my stereotypes
My girls in twos
That maximum exposure Rosa
Know what I wanna do
Telling all the girls, all around the world
My last name must be Robbins
Cause I'm baskin' in these asses
All thirty-one flavors keep calling
My-my-my-my vanilla Cinderella
Love when I tell her "drop it"
My butter pecan Rican
But I-I love my chocolate

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
And I can't believe it
White girl got some ass, I wanna see it
Black girl got a ass, it ain't a secret
Baby, turn around, I wanna see it

She got that badonkadonk-a-donk-donkey
Thang so fat, thang so chunky
Call me Michael Jackson, he-he
Cause I love to play with monkeys
It's a Miami thing, that's right
We down for anything, that's right
You do everything, that's right
Flo Rida, Pitbull, and the gang
I'm off the chain-a-lang-lang-lang
Ustedes saben quien es quien
Mira esa gringa con toda esa nalga de dream
Como tu sabes estoy loco
Pero que bueno que era poco
Mami mueve los cocos
I don't care where you're from
As long as you got that bubble bum

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
And I can't believe it
White girl got some ass, I wanna see it
Black girl got a ass, it ain't a secret
Baby, turn around, I wanna see it
Tryin' to see it, gotta see it
I wanna see that

It's that ancient love
That you won't outgrow
It's the fee you pay
It's the debt you owe
It's that subtle way
That you throw me down
And I'm inches above
The dust on the ground

And I await your call
I await your crown
So let's change our roads
And twist the mould around
It's that subtle way
You throw me down
And I'm inches above
The dust on the ground

And always quiet
Always quiet now
And always silent
Always silent now
No I don't hide it
I don't hide it now
It's that ancient love
That just moves along
And there's an itch so slight
Even when you're gone
Well I met you right
But I kept you wrong
And I must wait until I've found the ground that you are walking on

And always quiet
Always quiet now
And always silent
Always silent now
No I don't hide it
I don't hide it now
No I don't hide it
I don't hide it now

[Verse]
I'm a little pea
I love the sky and the trees
I'm a teeny, tiny little ant
Checking out this and that
And I am nothing
Ah, so you have nothing to hide
And I'm a pacifist
So I can fuck your shit up
Oh yeah, I'm small
Oh yeah, I'm small

[Outro]
So fucking what?
So fucking what?
So fucking what?

[Verse]
London town, I came to shut it down
I'm the king of the underground they call me A$AP Rocky baby
Let's do it! Oh we 'bout to spit for real
I be that trill kid, that pretty mother fucka you know
Worry about who hot, talk about who hotter
Harlem globetrotter, his shirt stay Margia
Black harry potter, couldn't get with me like your father
Green coop looking like guava
Couldn't get with me, look its Spike Lee on the scene
And I'm balling out of my league
Camoflauge on cause I came up fly guys
So I do dirty money, hand sanitize fries
What's that you eating? Throw some salt on it
You know they like pigs throw the pork on it
And I see them in the road throw a fork on it
And I, rest in peace throw the corpse on it
I can floss on it word to ?
And I stick them in the gutter and I get at your lil brother
Never start a ? coming at your mother
And you know me and A$AP we gon' just ride for each other
What's up?
Like a goblin, tell them keep slobbin' on my knobbin'
I don't give a damn because I'm mobbin'
With my crew came down to London town, shut it down
Give me the crown I got the sound, whatever
I come through with the lever and I hit you with the mother effer
?
And you know I'm like a marksman with the Glock 10 and I put it to your cartman
And I bring it to your door, give it to you raw
ODB, shimmy shimmy shimmy ya ooh!
And my hat say "calm the f down"
Came to London town, came to shut it down
This is off of the tippity top and the dome and I'm comin'
Im creamin' and niggas know that I singin it and I come through in it
Got these niggas singing it oh!
No curses on the verses whats worse?
Put them in the hurst, bad bitch red skirt
You know that she flirt, I'm smoking on that purp
And I like that purple drank, I would put you in the dirt
Never talk never chirp, use a bird
Don't want it with me kick them chickens to the curb
Girls got nerve and the fiends got served
And you know the D's on me cause the D's got served, word? Ok
This is off of the top and
A$AP Rocky came off of the block
Bandana around my neck, money signs on the grinding
You already know Harlem world we shining
I day dream pretty women out in Beijing
Paris say ling hop up in the saline
I chase dreams, man white but the face green
Same thing everyday, everything green
F my reply, ? through the statements
Help me with my statements, I was saving in my savings
From a three bedroom shack I was raised in, the condos out in Jersey full of J. West paintings
Talk to the boy how you talk the lord, talk to these broads how I talk to my dog
? plates, Margiella rugs, my boys make smores out you marshmallow thugs
Hop up out of first class, hop into that E-Class
Cut raw cut school I ain't ever see class
If so I was cutting in my nigga Steve's class
School of hard knocks graduated with a G Pass
G Code, Street Code, Fake niggas, cheat codes
Niggas trying to turn fake shit green cheap gold
I don't know how they do it for the freak shows
But I ain't gonna be smoked, so we toast
A$AP, A$AP
Yo we could do this all day alright?
Yo I could do it all day I could keep going man
Let me know whats up
Keep doing your thing!
Yo I'm on to the next-ist, you looking at the bestest
Married to the game treat you niggas like my step-kids
Pull up in the Porsche, niggas feel nausea
Didn't write the rules but my status like the author
Just crashed the Range, so I pulled the Bent out
Probably getting brains, chilling in my penthouse
Slackin' on your mackin' and I'm bout to lay my pimp down
Christian Louis Vuitton red bottoms come in mens now
On to the next one, skinny jeans fitted
Pull up to these shows and these hoes know to get in
Said they like my fitted clothes down to my split ends
Little do she know I got a big ego
On the next and gotta order a protection
Killin' feelin' all these records so my charges is molesting
And assault with deadly weapons so these rappers feeling threatened
They the hip hop patron, I'm a hip hop felon

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
She's only eighteen, don't like the Rolling Stones
She took the short cut to being fully grown
She's got that mood ring, a little sister rose
The smell of Springsteen, a pair of pantyhose

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
This talking picture show is leaking from a silhouette
She said, “My man, you know, it's time to get your fingers wet”
Your hustle's busted when you can't afford a cigarette
The last I heard from you, you were screaming “Handle it!”

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Knock the world, right off its feet and straight onto its head
The book of love will long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you and what was said
Make a play for all the brightest minds, and light will shed

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
I heard some P-Funk out on the road again
To get your head shrunk, is what I recommend
It's in your bloodline, a perfect Frankenstein
Out on that lone pine, I'm going to make you mine

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
It's understood, you wrapped your voodoo right around my neck
You've got some glitter on your kitty at the discotheque
I put my loving in your oven not a head to check
The last I heard from you, you were screaming “Resurrect!”

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Knock the world, right off its feet and straight onto its head
The book of love will long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you and what was said
Make a play for all the brightest minds, and light will shed
(Uuh)

[Guitar Solo: John Frusciante, Anthony Kiedis]
Haha!

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Knock the world, right off its feet and straight onto its head
The book of love will long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you and what was said
Make a play for all the brightest minds, and light will shed

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Bells around St. Petersburg when I saw you
I hope I get what you deserve
And this is where I find—
Smoke surrounds your perfect face and I'm falling
Pushing a broom out into space
And this where I find a way

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
The Stadium Arcadium
A mirror to the moon (Mirror to the moon)
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming (Warming to you)
State of the art until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon (Before and after noon)
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming (Warming to you)
Pushing myself and, no, I don't mind asking now

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Alone inside my forest room and it's storming
I never thought I'd be in bloom, but this is where I start
(Derelict days, and the stereo plays for the all night crowd that it cannot phase)
And I'm calling
(Tedious weeds that the media breeds, but the animal gets what the animal needs)
And I'm sorry

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
The Stadium Arcadium
A mirror to the moon (Mirror to the moon)
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming (Warming to you)
State of the art until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon (Before and after noon)
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming (Warming to you)
Pushing myself and, no, I don't mind asking now

[Guitar Solo: John Frusciante]

[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
And this is where I find

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Rays of dust that wrap around your citizen
Kind enough to disavow, and this is where I stand

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
The Stadium Arcadium
A mirror to the moon (Mirror to the moon)
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming (Warming to you)
State of the art until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon (Before and after noon)
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming (Warming to you)
Pushing myself and, no, I don't mind asking

[Outro: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
The Stadium Arcadium
A mirror to the moon (Mirror to the moon)
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming (Warming to you)
State of the art until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon (Before and after noon)
Well I'm forming and I'm warming (Warming to you)
To you

(Yeah) Aw yeah

[Chorus]
I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane

[Post-Chorus]
Pleasure spiked with pain
That motherfucker's always spiked with pain

[Verse 1]
Looking in my own eyes, hey Lord
I can't find the love I want
Someone better slap me
Before I start to rust
Before I start to decompose
Looking in my rear-view mirror
Looking in my rear-view mirror
I can make it disappear
I can make it disappear, have no fear

[Chorus]
I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane

[Post-Chorus]
Pleasure spiked with pain
That motherfucker's always spiked with pain

[Verse 2]
Sitting in my kitchen, hey girl
I'm turning into dust again
My melancholy baby
The star of Mazzy must
Push her voice inside of me
I'm overcoming gravity
I'm overcoming gravity
It's easy when you're sad to be
It's easy when you're sad, sad like me

[Chorus]
I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane

[Post-Chorus]
Pleasure spiked with pain

[Bridge]
Just one note could make me float
Could make me float away
One note from the song she wrote
Could fuck me where I lay
Just one note could make me choke
One note, that's not a lie
Just one note could cut my throat
One note could make me die

[Chorus]
I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane

[Post-Chorus]
Pleasure spiked with pain

[Outro: Children]
(It's my aeroplane)
(It's my aeroplane)
(It's my aeroplane)

It's my aeroplane, it's my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane

Versace Versace Medusa head on me like I'm 'luminati
I'm gon' need 100 more bottles a rich nigga stepped in the party
Givenchy Givenchy Givenchy all black and I look like I'm Kanye
Stepping out the Murcielago the hoes they keep calling me Andre'
I'm smoking on loud, and I'm sipping on lean, and I'm bout to take flight
Bad bitch she ridin' with me and she having the time of her life
I walk in the store with 100 racks on me like boy what it do
I'm ridin' round town and smokin' on loud and my car got no roof
Size 32, I copped 'em in blue, Versace my shoe
Medusa my chain, it look so insane, I need everything new
I walk in the club they cut on this song that shit look like a zoo
I rock the Versace shirt once, and they Monkey-see Monkey-Doo
And when I come step on the scene, soulja boy fresher than you
Step through the door in Versace, me and all of my crew
I copped in red and in green, and then I went and copped it in blue
And Drake killed the Versace beat and Soulja boy came killed it too
I'm Gone

[Verse 1]
Annie laid her head down in the roses
She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons
In her long brown hair
I don't know, it must have been the roses
All I know is I could not leave her there

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know was I could not leave her there

[Verse 2]
Ten years the waves rolled the
Ships home from the sea
Thinking well how it may blow
In all good company
If I tell another what
Your own lips told to me
Let me lay neath the roses
Let my eyes no longer see

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know was I could not leave her there

[Verse 3]
One pane of glass in the window
No one is complaining though
Come in and shut the door
Faded is the crimson from the
Ribbons that she wore
And it's strange how no one
Comes round anymore

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know was I could not leave her there

[Verse 1]
Annie laid her head down in the roses
She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons
In her long brown hair
I don't know, it must have been the roses
All I know is I could not leave her there

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know was I could not leave her there

Mona Lisa, Lisa Moanin'
Got some drinks and some motherfucking reefer blowing
I tell her fuck with me and you could be something
Yo girl so bad I want the threesome
Threesome, trying to have a threesome
Look at my watch 'bout three somethin'
Threesome trying to have a threesome
Fuck with me and you could be something

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I believe in God and rubbers
Even if we sex you are not my lover
Hit you on the couch and not the covers
And if you bring you friend then we got to fuck her
That's what I'm down for no convo, my condo
And if I answer this phone call don't make a sound ho
My life is my odyssey my dogs to the right of me
I got the girl you can't lay a finger on right here massaging me
Like Yeah....I'm the nigga I know it, I'm the nigga I know it
My Momma say I'm a poet, you hating praying I blow it
But this the life I made though
I show a bad bitch what she made for

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Mona Lisa, Lisa Moanin'
Got some drinks and some motherfucking reefer blowing

Fuck with me and you could be something

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I'm eating lobster with my shrimp hand
Feeling on her with my pimp hand
I'm talking to her like her Daddy do
And bet she give me everything but attitude
Mathematical, radical
Twist my fingers up and rep my avenue
Penthouse altitude, being broke is not compatible
Get a fine girl, Patron that
Get a finer one, and then clone that
You cuff your wife like I want that
When I got freaky women tongue kissing
Marijuana lung lifting
Give long dick then I'm long distance
You in the club bromancing
I got her homancing
Face in my lap nose dancing
No pants screaming

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Mona Lisa, Lisa Moanin'
Got some drinks and some motherfucking reefer blowing
I tell her fuck with me and you could be something
Yo girl so bad I want the threesome

Fuck with me and you could be something

And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world
And I, just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl
And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything
No, no, no not anything and you

[Verse 1 : Big Sean]
Yeah, I got a brand new Benz
Crazy right, brand new Benz
Got less miles on it than I do friends
Remember when we laid at you and Paige’s crib
Was there so long I coulda paid rent
Remember when we couldn’t get shit?
Best thing bout being broke is you don’t spend shit
Remember that Christmas? We had a wish list
We couldn’t afford nothin' but we still get shit
Ironically those were the times I felt the richest
All those times that we spent by the pool girl
Was too broke to even take you to the zoo girl
Maybe its because I had you girl
Was thinking about when we went to London and Paris
And gave each other times that we cherished
Remember when you saw the Eiffel Tower
And you got so drunk threw up? Yup you were so embarrassed
See those are times I can’t let go, I can’t let go
Man I hate to see you single in the club looking for kisses and hugs
So you Sipping on XO til I snatch you up like “let’s go”

[Hook: Miguel & Big Sean]
And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world
And I, just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl
And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything
No, no, no not anything and you
Can't nobody do it like you do it, like you do it, like you do it, like you

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
My bad for those long long nights, long nights when I left you in the sheets
Sorry for when you had to cry yourself to sleep
Tried to count on me and I made you count sheep
Sorry when you put your faith in me I was unfaithful, disgraceful, distasteful
Yeah I know you’re not supposed to hate cake and eat too
Crazy how these hoes always kept my plate full
What about the emails you hacked in?
I know we hate to live in the past-tense
It’s been weird since I went out west and did an album with No I.D
And ain’t came back since
Now we the best in the city, I rep for the city
That’s about the time that you left for the city
You and all your girls moved to NY
I shoulda’ known now how you watch Sex And The City
I know we ain’t close but, I gotta focus on blowing up
I know I promised that I’d be there, and really did I ever show up?
I know I wasn’t honest to ya girl
Almost broke every promise to ya girl
Brought problems to your world
And you said “how could you just lie to me? I thought you’d die for me?”
I was scared you’d find somebody who would treat you like you supposed to
You the type niggas get close to, get close to, and then propose to
And when Thanksgiving come around
I ain't tryna bring hoes through to momma
So it’s back to the drama
“No I don’t know that number”
“Why the hell you text it?”
Heartbreak hotel man, with no exit just checked in
Young and living reckless

[Hook: Miguel & Big Sean]
And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world
And I, just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl
And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything
No, no, no not anything and you
Can't nobody do it like you do it, like you do it, like you do it, like you

[Outro: Miguel]
I can't imagine myself without you
I need a whole lot of help without you
Me and my granny both agreed
Damn you're such a G I’ll hold you down forever, B

[Hook: Miguel & Big Sean]
And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world
And I, just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl

No, no, no not anything and you
Can't nobody do it like you do it, like you do it, like you do it, like you

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
How about we pretend all these niggas not around
And get fucked up like we was out of town
Woah, then get fucked up and go get out of town
Swerve, swerve
And tell ourselves that one time doesn't count, tell me
How fucked up you down to get?
A pound? A zip? A thousand sips
Red cup yeah that college shit
Free liquor got it on scholarship
Bitch act like you don't know what's up
Act like it ain't my crew blowing up
Lose not to much champagne, no throwing up
One time for the set, please go throw it up
It's Finally Famous, overbooked, overpaid and overpriced
But don't get it twisted, that shit ain't happen overnight
Had dreams of balling now I'm NFLing
Let her spend the night, she feel like Cinderella
All she tell me is-

I know, I know, I know I'm the reason you get dressed up
I know, I know, I know I'm the reason you get messed up
Heart breaker, young heart breaker
When you get in the game I swear the whole world commentates you
But man, I don't give a fuck what they saying, I don't give a fuck about opinions
I don't give a fuck about feelings, I ain't no dentist, either I did, I do or I didn't
You could try to tell me how to live my life, I ain't hearing it
I must be doing something right if every mill comes with a spare I guess
Straight, straight, straight up out that dirt, but my t-shirt clean, ohh
Do it for the city, that's the 313
That's unnecessary, fuck her like she my secretary
Ass and face is hereditary, her momma, shit, legendary
You don't know what you do

Go, go, go, go. go

Ooh I wanna put the dogs on the head of this good motherfucker
Ooh now look at here baby
If the jaws of my pussy start to grippin' (mhm)
Don't pay that no mind, it's just that my pussy done got nervous
And a dick like that will make any pussy excited
Ooh shit, I could take a little bit more of this good motherfucker (oh my God, oh God, oh shit)
Baby, oh (oh, oh, oh sh-)

[Intro: Nas]
Sorry Sierra Leone, one day we'll right the wrongs

[Chorus: Big Sean & James Fauntleroy]
She tell me she love me
I'm everything that she want
Top floor, only way that we go
Diamonds and gold, Sierra Leone, Leone
Hotel look like Sierra Leone, Leone
Chain, ring look like Sierra Leone, Leone
And she don't ever tell me I'm wrong, I'm wrong
Cause she don't want to leave Sierra Leone, Leone

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Get to it, I be getting to it
Hella groovin', rooftop, better viewin'
Always hella coppin', no propellers, moving bank tellers
Movin', youngin', revenuin', mozzarella chewin', you know?
Lobster butter basted
I deserve every crumb tasted, road to riches one way and
Sunbathing, tongue tastin'
After that she wine tasting, Sean tastin'
You know? I gave her diamonds and gold
That's Sierra Leone, her friends like "Girl don't let go!"
So she ain't askin', she ain't whinin'
Complainin' or trippin', man I got her damn near strippin'
For the handbag livin', Saks Fifth'n, tag rippin'
No more tab splittin', cab gettin', who wants to go back to that livin'? Do yah?
So let's sex on the beach
Then the rest on the sheets for the rest of the week, 'til

[Chorus: Big Sean & James Fauntleroy]
She tell me she love me
I'm everything that she want
Top floor, only way that we go
Diamonds and gold, Sierra Leone, Leone
Hotel look like Sierra Leone, Leone
Chain, ring look like Sierra Leone, Leone
And she don't ever tell me I'm wrong, I'm wrong
Cause she don't want to leave Sierra Leone, Leone

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
What you know about wake up to fuckin' 'fore you even can stretch?
Yeah I'm on vacay and my dick still need a rest
I might get her on film, star and direct
Just might win an award if that shit hit the net
Oh, reclinin' in seats
Not liftin' a finger 'less I'm signin' receipts
Livin' life like I got a degree
Fuck it, I'm livin' life like I done got in the league
Look, my car look like it play for the Lakers
Credit card look like it play for the Raiders
I watch it play for the paper
Chandelier, marble floor on the feet
She said I'm a don, I gotta agree, I fuck her to sleep

[Chorus: Big Sean & James Fauntleroy]
She tell me she love me
I'm everything that she want
Top floor, only way that we go
Diamonds and gold, Sierra Leone, Leone
Hotel look like Sierra Leone, Leone
Chain, ring look like Sierra Leone, Leone
And she don't ever tell me I'm wrong, I'm wrong
Cause she don't want to leave Sierra Leone, Leone

[Greedy Ho's Skit]
Big Sean: I gotta take a shower, you so goddamn nasty, baby
*someone knocks at the door*
Big Sean: Hey, who is it?
His girl: Oh shit, it's just room service
Big Sean: Room service? Again?
His girl (to her friend): What about these rings? What are you looking for?
Big Sean: Hey can you grab me a towel?
Her friend: What about that phone?
*Big Sean singing*
His girl: Come on, lets get outta here
Big Sean: Yo! Yo! Hello? Bitch! What the fuck?

[Produced by Xaphoon Jones]

[Refrain 1]
Hella cheese, hella trees, LSD
Selling D, feeling like the 70s
Getting paid like we seventy

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Float around my town like it's the motherfucking seven seas
Hit the club, lose seven Gs, film it all on 7D's
Spilling liquor rest in peace, rest of my G's rest with a piece
Start the day dissecting weed, then strategize then rest my team
Same show, different seats, same game, different league
Living life I hope that everyone I love will get to see
Get to see, get to see, get to see, get to see
Living life I hope that everyone I love will get to see
Get to see, get to see, get to see, get to see
Bitch

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I was thinking about the ice that I put on, money that I've blown
Bitches that I know, everything that I've done wrong
All the licks I hit, all the bullets missed
Got my shit legit, a lot of people pissed, well
I got money coming through
Drugs and women coming too
Got my family living comfortable
Got me thinking I'm doing what I'm supposed to do
I'm doing what I'm supposed to do
I'm doing what I'm supposed to do

[Refrain 2]
Hella cheese, hella trees, LSD
Selling D, feeling like the 70s
Getting paid like we seventy
Use to roll around in that Toyota rolling seven deep, damn

[Outro: Big Sean]
Bitch
Bitch
I used to go out to parties
And stand around
Cause I was too nervous
To really get down
But my body yearned to be free
I got up on the floor and thought
Somebody could choose me
No more standin' there beside the walls
I done got myself together baby
And now I'm havin' a ball
As long as you're groovin'
There's always a chance
Somebody watches
Might wanna make romance

Move your body, ooo baby, you dance all night
To the groove and feel alright
Everybody's groovin' on like a fool
But if you see me spread out and let me in
Baby just party high and low
Let me step into your erotic zone
Move it up
Turn it 'round
Shake it down
OOWWWW

You can love me when you want to babe
This is such a groovy party baby
We're here face to face
Everybody's swingin'
This is such a groovy place
All the young ladies are so fine!
You're movin your body easy with no doubts
I know what you thinkin' baby
You wanna turn me out
Think I'm gonna let you do it babe

Keep on dancin'
You got to get it
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin' (You got to get it)
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin' (You got to get it)
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin' (You got to get it)
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin' (You got to get it)
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin' (You got to get it, oh darling)
Got to give it up
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh

[Instrumental Break]

If you want to dance some more
Dance some more
Feels so good - dancing
Oh yeah
It's so good
Lift up, baby - feels so good
Have mercy

Non-stop express party
Standing by
Get down

Non-stop, express - party y'all
Feels good, this trance, I've got to dance
Get down
Let's dance, let's shout
Get funky, what it's all about
Let's dance, let's shout
Get funky, what it's all about

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
They come from every state to find
Some dreams were meant to be declined
Tell the man, what did you have in mind?
“What have you come to do?”
No turning water into wine
No learning while you're in the line
I'll take you to the broken sign
You see, the lights are blue

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]
Come and get it, lost it at the city limit
Say goodbye, 'cause they will find a way to trim it
Everybody lookin' for a silly gimmick
Gotta get away, can't take it for another minute

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
This town is made of many things
Just look at what the current brings
So high, it's only promising
This place was made on you

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Tell me, baby, what's your story?
Where you come from and where you wanna go this time? Oh
Tell me, lover, are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh
Tell me, baby, what's your story?
Where do you come from and where you wanna go this time? Oh
You're so lovely, are you lonely?
Oh, giving up on the innocence you left behind

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Some claim to have the fortitude
Too shrewd to blow the interlude
Sustaining pain to set a mood
Step out to be renewed
I'll move you like a baritone
Jungle Brothers on the microphone
Getting over with an undertone
It's time to turn to stone

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]
Chitty-chitty, baby, when your nose is in the nitty-gritty
Life could be a little sweet, but life could be a little shitty
What a pity, Boston and a Kansas City
Looking for a hundred, but you only ever found a fifty

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Three fingers in the honeycomb
You ring just like a xylophone
Devoted to the chromosome
The day that you left home

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Tell me, baby, what's your story?
Where you come from and where you wanna go this time? Oh
Tell me, lover, are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh
Tell me, baby, what's your story?
Where you come from and where you wanna go this time? Oh
You're so lovely, are you lonely?
Oh, giving up on the innocence you left behind
(Behind!)

[Guitar Solo: John Frusciante]

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Tell me, baby, what's your story?
Where you come from and where you wanna go this time? Oh
Tell me, lover, are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh
Tell me, baby, what's your story?
Where you come from and where you wanna go this time? Oh
You're so lovely, are you lonely?
Oh, giving up on the innocence you left behind

[Verse 1]
I know that lately
Things haven't been so good
I always said
If I could ever help you I would
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, I love you
For a thousand years
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, I'm here
To wipe away the tears

[Chorus]
I will be your friend 'til the end of time
I will be your friend
I'm here to make you smile

[Verse 2]
When you're fallin' apart
I pick up each piece
Build a wall around your dreams
The punches to your heart
Melt away when you never thought they'd heal
So trust in me
These are the words I tattoo on you
If Hercules can pick you up
I will I really am true

[Chorus]
I will be your friend 'til the end of time
I will be your friend
I'm here to make you smile

[Bridge]
Ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh, I love you
For a thousand years
Ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh, I'm here
To wipe away the tears

[Verse 3]
You've got so much to give
I'll tell you (Just when you need to know)
Get out and live
Pick you up when you're feeling low
So here's my hand
Trust in me I really am true
You've got to understand
There's nothing
I wouldn't do

[Chorus]
I will be your friend until the end of time
I will be your friend
I'm here to make you smile

[Chorus]
I will be your friend until the end of time
I will be your friend
I'm here to make you smile

[Bridge]
You've got so much to give
Ooh, oh, oh, oh
Get out and live
Ooh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I will be your friend until the end of time
I will be your friend
I'm here to make you smile

[Outro]
The Punches to your heart (Ooh, ooh)
Take my hand
When your falling apart (Ooh, ooh)
Oh, you've got to understand
I will be your friend until the end of time
(verse 1)
I am the type of man
Who's born to win
That's my way, that
My sin

I'm the type of man they
Love to hate
'cause I'm so real and
They're so fake

I'm the type of man who
Gets knocked down
Then gets back up, i'm so
Proud

I'm the type of man who's
Here to stay
Live my life my own way

[Hook]
I am what i am , i am what i am
Yes i am, what i am (x2)
(verse 2)
I'm the type of man
Who's loves to fight
Not when wrong, just
When right

I'm the type of man
Who has to pray
Every night, every day

I'm the type of man
Who needs to be
All that i, i can be

I'm the type of man
Who works to live
Loves his wife and
Raise his kids

[hook]
I am what i am, i am what i am
Yes i am, what i am

I am what i am, i am what i am
Yes i am, what i am (x2)

[Verse 1]
If everything would just stop
Then maybe I could collect my thoughts
If everything would stand still
I could've hidden how lost I feel

[Pre-Chorus]
I should've said what I hear
I should've let myself fear
I should've made myself clear

[Chorus]
So this is how we fall apart
This is how the ending starts
And when we find we lost our marks
We fake what we don't know

[Verse 2]
I never asked to let go
I never thought I could sink so low
I never let myself down
Until the second I did right now

[Pre-Chorus]
I should've said what I hear
I should've let myself fear
I should've made myself clear

[Chorus]
So this is how we fall apart
This is how the ending starts
And when we find we lost our marks
We fake what we don't know

So this is how we fall apart
This is how the ending starts
'Cause when our heads betray our hearts
We fake what we don't know

[Bridge]
'Cause all we are is everything we've done
All we are is how quickly we run
And all we are
We are

[Interlude]
This is how we fall apart
But this is how beginnings start
Cause when our heads betray our hearts
We fake what we don't know
And if our doubt begins again
The answers find us in the end
So in the meantime, we'll pretend
And fake what we don't know

[Chorus]
This is how we fall apart
But this is how beginnings start
Cause when our heads betray our hearts
We fake what we don't know

And if our doubt begins again
The answers find us in the end
So in the meantime, we'll pretend
And fake what we don't know

[Verse 1]
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair
I wouldn’t be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere
You got something I want plenty of
Ooh, a little touch of your love

[Verse 2]
Hazel, stardust in your eye
You’re going somewhere and so am I
I’d give you the sky high above
Ooh, for a little touch of your love

[Bridge]
Oh no, I don’t need any reminder
To know how much I really care
But it’s just making me blinder and blinder
Because I’m up on a hill and still you’re not there

[Verse 3]
Hazel, you called and I came
Now don’t make me play this waiting game
You’ve got something I want plenty of
Ooh, a little touch of your love
SELF-SERVING, ARROGANT, PRETENTIOUS, CONTROLLING, STUBBORN, INCONSISTENT, MORALLY GREY… GORGEOUS, MODEST, COMPASSIONATE, GENIUS, HONEST, KIND, RELIABLE, RARE HUMAN BEING.

i’ll take the positive and not so positive adjectives about me in stride.

[Verse 1]
I once held her
In my arms
She said she would
Always stay
But I was cruel
I treated her like a fool
I threw it all away

[Verse 2]
Once I had mountains
In the palm of my hand
And rivers that ran through
Every day
But I must have been mad
I never knew what I had
Until I threw it all away

[Bridge]
Love is all there is
It makes the world go ’round
Love and only love
It can’t be denied
No matter what you think about it
You just won’t be able to do without it
Take a tip from one who’s tried

[Verse 3]
So if you find someone
Who gives you all of her love
Take it to your heart, don’t let it stray
For one thing for certain
You will surely be a-hurtin'
If you throw it all away
If you throw it all away

[Verse 1]
You got a lot of nerve
To say you are my friend
When I was down
You just stood there grinning

[Verse 2]
You got a lot of nerve
To say you got a helping hand to lend
You just want to be on
The side that’s winning

[Verse 3]
You say I let you down
You know it’s not like that
If you’re so hurt
Why then don’t you show it?

[Verse 4]
You say you lost your faith
But that’s not where it’s at
You had no faith to lose
And you know it

[Verse 5]
I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd
You’re in with

[Verse 6]
Do you take me for such a fool
To think I’d make contact
With the one who tries to hide
What he don’t know to begin with

[Verse 7]
You see me on the street
You always act surprised
You say “How are you? Good luck!”
But you don’t mean it

[Verse 8]
When you know as well as me
You’d rather see me paralyzed
Why don’t you just come out once
And scream it

[Verse 9]
No, I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief
Perhaps I’d rob them

[Verse 10]
And now I know you’re dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don’t you understand
It’s not my problem

[Verse 11]
I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment
I could be you

[Verse 12]
Yes, I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
You’d know what a drag it is
To see you
NO MATTER HOW DIM IT GETS WHEREVER I AM

I never quit working. I work in the dark cause work is light. I tell my work all my problems because it never gives answers i have already. It never edits without me. Doesn’t call me names. I give my work away, because it doesn’t cost me much. In fact i’m indebted. I work hard since life is hard. Death is a soft place, it can wait. But work ain’t love. And love ain’t work. For sure.
Is it rolling, Bob?

[Verse 1]
To be alone with you
Just you and me
Now won’t you tell me true
Ain’t that the way it oughta be?
To hold each other tight
The whole night through
Everything is always right
When I’m alone with you

[Verse 2]
To be alone with you
At the close of the day
With only you in view
While evening slips away
It only goes to show
That while life’s pleasures be few
The only one I know
Is when I’m alone with you

[Verse 3]
They say that nighttime is the right time
To be with the one you love
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day
But you’re always what I’m thinkin' of
I wish the night were here
Bringin' me all of your charms
When only you are near
To hold me in your arms

[Verse 4]
I’ll always thank the Lord
When my workin' day is through
I get my sweet reward
To be alone with you

[Verse 1]
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Whatever colors you have in your mind
I’ll show them to you and you’ll see them shine

[Verse 2]
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay
Stay with your man awhile
Until the break of day, let me see ya' make him smile
His clothes are dirty but his, his hands are clean
And you’re the best thing that he’s ever seen

[Verse 3]
Stay, lady, stay
Stay with your man awhile

[Bridge]
Why wait any longer for the world to begin
You can have your cake and eat it too
Why wait any longer for the one you love
When he’s standing in front of you

[Verse 4]
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay
Stay while the night is still ahead
I long to see you in the morning light
I long to reach for you in the night

[Outro]
Stay, lady, stay
Stay while the night is still ahead

[Verse 1]
One more night, the stars are in sight
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be
Oh, the moon is shinin' bright
Lighting everything in sight
But tonight no light will shine on me

[Verse 2]
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad I lost the only pal I had
I just could not be what she wanted me to be
I will turn my head up high
To that dark and rollin' sky
For tonight no light will shine on me

[Bridge]
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true
I had no idea what a woman in love would do

[Verse 3]
One more night, I will wait for the light
While the wind blows high above the tree
Oh, I miss my darlin' so
I didn't mean to see her go
But tonight no light will shine on me

[Verse 4]
One more night, the moon is shinin' bright
And the wind blows high above the tree
Oh, I miss that woman so
I didn't mean to see her go
But tonight no light will shine on me

[Verse 1]
I have heard rumors all over town
They say that you’re planning to put me down
All I'd like you to do
Is tell me that it isn’t true

[Verse 2]
They say that you’ve been seen with some other man
That he’s tall, dark and handsome, and you’re holdin' his hand
Darling, I’m a'countin’ on you
Tell me that it isn’t true

[Bridge]
To know that some other man is holdin' you tight
It hurts me all over, it doesn’t seem right

All of these awful things that I have heard
I don’t wanna believe them, all I want is your word
So darlin', you better come through
Tell me that it isn’t true
All of these awful things that I have heard
I don’t want to believe them, all I want is your word
So darlin', I'm countin' on you
Tell me that it isn’t true

[Verse 1]
Just like old Saxophone Joe
When he’s got the hogshead up on his toe
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie

[Verse 2]
Listen to the fiddler play
When he’s playin' 'til the break of day
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie

[Verse 3]
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime
What do I care?
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum
Call me for dinner, honey, I’ll be there

[Verse 4]
Saddle me up my big white goose
Tie me on her and turn her loose
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie

[Verse 5]
I don’t need much, that ain’t no lie
Ain’t runnin' any race
Give to me my country pie
I won’t throw it up in anybody’s face

[Verse 6]
Shake me up that old peach tree
A'Little Jack Horner got nothin’ on me
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie

[Verse 1]
Throw my ticket out the window
Throw my suitcase out there, too
Throw my troubles out the door
I don't need them anymore
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you

[Verse 2]
I should have left this town this morning
But it was more than I could do
Oh, your love comes on so strong
And I've waited all day long
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you

[Bridge]
Is it really any wonder
The love that a stranger might receive?
You cast your spell and I went under
I find it so difficult to leave

[Verse 3]
I can hear that whistle blowin'
I see that stationmaster too
If there's a poor boy on the street
Then let him have my seat
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you

[Verse 1]
Throw my ticket out the window
Throw my suitcase out there, too
Throw my troubles out the door
I don't need them anymore
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you

[Intro]
Yeah
I'm g-o-o-d
You feel me, yeah

[Verse 1]
Fresh fit new Chucks
I swear I feel like a million bucks
And them leather seats feel like plush
Four twelves make my shit go bump (go bump)
20 carrats got your bitch goin' nuts
Livin' like a star, so they get so struck
Far as rap, got this shit sowed up
Ridin' by myself couple sticks rolled up
On these frames, I done spent so much
Niggas wanna nip, so the fo-fifth on tuck
And just look, don't touch
I know you don't see this usually
But excuse me, these Gucci
Got a future so bright, you'll see
Man I'm this young, why is life so sweet
In my shoes, yeah, they might wanna be
The cameras right here and the lights on me
Let's go

[Hook]
I'm good
Livin' just the way I should
Most niggas ain't think I could
Look homie, I'm good
Doin' what I said I would
You try but to me, it ain't 'nothing to it
Cause lil homie, I'm good
Most niggas ain't think I could
But I'm livin' just the way I should
Yeah homie, I'm good
Yeah I'm good
Yeah I'm good
Yeah I'm good

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, more cars, more clothes
Get money, that's the life I chose
Chase money nigga, why chase hoes
They ain't even want me 'til my neck got froze
And the price got told
Stories by trips in the nice sized homes
It's a game, play the life I know
On the winnin' end wen the dice got rolled
Tall nigga so my flights got room
Small nigga so I always got goons
Say you get a lil' cash, that's cool
I probaly spent more than that on tattoos
I got the formula you need to find
My city on lock and the keys are mine
So you can go and keep your piece of mind
Cause I'm G, 2 Os, and a D with mine
Let's go

[Hook]

'Cause you are my superstar (Superstar, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm your number one fan, give me your autograph (Yeah, yeah)
Sign it right here on my heart
Girl, I'll be your groupie, baby (I'll be your groupie, baby)
'Cause you are my superstar
And as your number one fan
I'll do all that I can
To show you how super you are
All the tired horses in the sun
How'm I supposed to get any riding done? Hmm
All the tired horses in the sun
How'm I supposed to get any riding done? Hmm
All the tired horses in the sun
How'm I supposed to get any riding done? Hmm
All the tired horses in the sun

[Verse 1]
Alberta let your hair hang low
Alberta let your hair hang low
I'll give you more gold
Than your apron can hold
If you'd only let your hair hang low

[Verse 2]
Alberta what's on your mind
Alberta what's on your mind
You keep me worried and bothered
All of the time
Alberta what's on your mind

[Verse 3]
Alberta don't you treat me unkind
Alberta don't you treat me unkind
Oh my heart is so sad
Cause I want you so bad
Alberta don't you treat me unkind

[Verse 4]
Alberta let your hair hang low
Alberta let your hair hang low
I'll give you more gold
Than your apron can hold
If you'll only let your hair hang low

[Intro]
Went out last night to take a little round
I met my Little Sadie and I brought her down
I ran right home and I went to bed
With a forty-four smokeless under my head

[Verse 1]
I began to think what a deed I'd done
I grabbed my hat and I began to run
I made a good run but I ran too slow
They overtook me down in Jericho

[Verse 2]
Standing on a corner a ringing' my bell
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville
He said "Young man is your name Brown
Remember you blowed Sadie down?"

[Verse 3]
"Oh yes sir, my name is Lee
I murdered Little Sadie in the first degree
First degree and second degree
If you've got any papers will you serve them to me?"

[Verse 4]
Well they took me down town and they dressed me in black
They put me on a train and they sent me back
I had no one to go my bail
They crammed me back into the county jail

[Verse 5]
Oh, yes they did
The judge and the jury they took their stand
The judge had the papers in his right hand

Forty-one days, forty-one nights
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes
Oh, no!

[Outro]
Went out last night to take a little round
I met Little Sadie and I blowed her down
I ran right home and I went to bed
A forty-four smokeless under my head

[Verse 1]
What’s the matter with me
I don’t have much to say
Daylight sneaking through the window
And I’m still in this all-night café
Walking to and fro beneath the moon
Out to where the trucks are rolling slow
To sit down on this bank of sand
And watch the river flow

[Verse 2]
Wish I was back in the city
Instead of this old bank of sand
With the sun beating down over the chimney tops
And the one I love so close at hand
If I had wings and I could fly
I know where I would go
But right now I’ll just sit here so contentedly
And watch the river flow

[Chorus]
People disagreeing on all just about everything, yeah
Makes you stop and all wonder why
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street
Who just couldn’t help but cry
Oh, this old river keeps on rolling, though
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And as long as it does I’ll just sit here
And watch the river flow

[Chorus]
People disagreeing everywhere you look
Makes you want to stop and read a book
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street
That was really shook
But this old river keeps on rolling, though
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And as long as it does I’ll just sit here
And watch the river flow

[Outro]
Watch the river flow
Watching the river flow
Watching the river flow
But I’ll sit down on this bank of sand
And watch the river flow

[Verse 1]
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view
The fair fields all alone
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron
Where beauty and pleasure were known

[Verse 2]
I spied a fair maid at her labour
Which caused me to stay for a while
And I thought of a goddess to beauty
Bloomin' bright star of Bright Isle

[Verse 3]
I humbled myself to her beauty
"Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Are you from heaven descended
Abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"

[Verse 4]
"Young man, I will tell you a secret
It's true I'm a maid that is poor
And to part from my vows and my promise
Is more than my heart can endure

[Verse 5]
Therefore I remain at my service
And go through all my hardship and toil
And wait for the lad that has left me
All alone on the banks of Belle Isle."

[Verse 6]
"Young maiden I wish not to banter
It's true I come here in disguise
I came here to fulfill our last promise
And hope to give you a surprise

[Verse 7]
I've known you're a maid I love dearly
And you've been in my heart all the while
For me there is no other damsel
Than my blooming bright star of Belle Isle."

[Verse 1]
Since you’ve been gone
I’ve been walking around
With my head bowed down to my shoes
I’ve been living the blues
Ev’ry night without you

[Verse 2]
I don’t have to go far (Ah-ah)
To know where you are (Ah-ah)
Strangers all give me the news
I’ve been living the blues (Living the blues)
Ev’ry night without you

[Chorus]
I think that it’s best
I soon get some rest
And forget my pride
But I can’t deny
This feeling that I
Carry for you deep down inside

[Verse 3]
If you see me this way (Ah-ah)
You’d come back and you’d stay (Ah-ah)
Oh, how could you refuse
I’ve been living the blues (Living the blues)
Ev’ry night without you

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I think that it’s best
I soon get some rest
And forget my pride
But I can’t deny
This feeling that I
Carry for you deep down inside

[Verse 3]
If you see me this way
You’d come back and you’d stay
Oh, how could you refuse
I’ve been living the blues (Living the blues)
Ev’ry night without you

[Outro]
I’ve been living the blues (Living the blues)
Ev’ry night without you
I’ve been living the blues (Living the blues)
Ev’ry night without you

[Verse 1]
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil
Fill it with new made corn mash and never more you'll toil
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight

[Verse 2]
Build you a fire with hickory, hickory, ash and oak
Don't use no green or rotten wood, they'll get you by the smoke
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight

[Verse 3]
My daddy he made whiskey, my granddaddy he did too
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight
In the pale moonlight

[Verse 1]
Done laid around, done stayed around
This old town too long
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on
Done laid around, done stayed around
This old town too long
And it seems like I've got to travel on
And it seems like I've got to travel on

[Verse 2]
Papa writes to Johnny, "Johnny, can't you come home ?
Johnny, can't you come home ? Johnny, can't you come home ?"
Papa writes to Johnny, "Johnny, can't you come home ?"
Johnny's been out on the road too long
Done laid around, done stayed around
This old town too long
And it seems like I've got to travel on
And it seems like I've got to travel on

[Verse 3]
That silly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
Going home to stay, going home to stay
That silly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
And I feel like I just want to travel on
Done laid around, done stayed around
This old town too long
And it seems like I've got to travel on
And it seems like I've got to travel on

[Verse 4]
There's a lonesome freight at 6.08 coming through the town
I'll be homward bound, I'll be homeward bound
There's a lonesome freight at 6.08 coming through the town
And I feel like I just want to travel on
Done laid around, done stayed around
This old town too long
And it seems like I've got to travel on
And it seems like I've got to travel on

[Verse 1]
If not for you
Babe, I couldn’t find the door
Couldn’t even see the floor
I’d be sad and blue
If not for you

[Verse 2]
If not for you
Babe, I’d lay awake all night
Wait for the morning light
To shine in through
But it would not be new
If not for you

[Chorus]
If not for you, my sky would fall
Rain would gather too
Without your love, I’d be nowhere at all
I’d be lost if not for you
And you know it’s true

[Chorus]
If not for you, my sky would fall
Rain would gather too
Without your love, I’d be nowhere at all
Oh, what would I do
If not for you

[Verse 3]
If not for you
Winter would have no spring
Couldn’t hear the robin sing
I just wouldn’t have a clue
Anyway it wouldn’t ring true
If not for you
If not for you
If not for you
If not for you
If not for you

[Verse 1]
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration
The birdies were flying from tree to tree
There was little to say, there was no conversation
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree
And the locusts sang off in the distance
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me

[Verse 2]
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb
I was ready to leave, I was already walking
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
Oh, the locusts sang their high whining trill
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me

[Verse 3]
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading
The weather was hot, a-nearly 90 degrees
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn’t fall on me
Yeah, the locusts sang off in the distance
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me

[Verse 4]
I put down my robe, picked up my diploma
Took hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota
Sure was glad to get out of there alive
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
And the locusts sang with a high whining trill
Yeah, the locusts sang and they was singing for me
Singing for me, well, singing for me

[Intro]
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her

[Verse 1]
You think you know the smile on her lips
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her

[Verse 2]
You think you'll find heaven of bliss
In each caress, in each tender kiss
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her

[Verse 3]
You stole her love from me one day
You didn't care how it hurt me
But you can never steal away memories of what used to be

[Verse 4]
You think she's yours, to have and to hold
Someday you'll learn, when her love grows cold
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her

[Verse 1]
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains
We sit beside bridges and walk beside fountains
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream
Time passes slowly when you’re lost in a dream

[Verse 2]
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking
Stared out the window to the stars high above
Time passes slowly when you’re searching for love

[Break]
Ain’t no reason to go in a wagon to town
Ain’t no reason to go to the fair
Ain’t no reason to go up, ain’t no reason to go down
Ain’t no reason to go anywhere

[Verse 3]
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight
We stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Time passes slowly and fades away

[Verse 1]
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummer's shore in that good old golden days
They call me a bummer and a ginsot too, but what cares I for praise ?
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore, in the days of '49"

[Chorus]
In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49

[Verse 2]
My comrades they all loved me well, a jolly saucy crew
A few hard cases I will recall though they all were brave and true
Whatever the pitch they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine
Like good old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49

[Chorus]
In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49

[Verse 3]
There was New York Jake, the butcher boy, he was always getting tight
And every time that he'd get full he was spoiling for a fight
But Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49

[Chorus]
In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49

[Verse 4]
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same
He would ante up and draw his cards and he would you go a hatful blind
In the game with death Bill lost his breath, in the days of '49

[Chorus]
In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49

[Verse 5]
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo, I never will forget
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet
One day he fell in a prospect hole, in a roaring bad design
And in that hole he roared out his soul, in the days of '49

[Chorus]
In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49

[Verse 6]
Of the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
And I'm left alone in my misery like some poor wandering ghost
And I pass by from town to town, they call me a rambling sign
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer shore in the days of '49 "

[Chorus]
In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49

[Verse 1]
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go

[Verse 2]
Cut on runway number nine, big 707 set to go
I'm stuck here on the ground, where the cold winds blow
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
There she goes, my friend, she's rolling down at last

[Verse 3]
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time

[Verse 4]
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
Because I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunks as I might be
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain

[Verse 1]
I bless the day I found you
I want my arms around you
And so I beg you: let it be me

[Verse 2]
Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me

[Verse 3]
Each time we meet, love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love, what would life be?

[Verse 4]
So never leave me lonely
Tell me that you love me only
And say you'll always let it be me

[Intro]
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own

[Bridge]
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for someone I really could care for

[Verse 1]
And suddenly there appeared before me the only one my arms could ever hold
I heard someone whisper, "Please, adore me"
And when I looked my moon had turned to gold

[Verse 2]
Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own
Without a love of my own

[Verse 1]
I'm just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squadered my resistance
For a pocketful of numbles
Such are promises, all lies and jest
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest

[Verse 2]
When I left my home and family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared, laying low
Seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

[Verse 3]
Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare
There were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there

[Bridge]
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone, going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me
Going home

[Verse 4]
In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
And cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
"I am leaving, I am leaving"
But the fighter still remains

[Verse 1]
Everybody’s building the big ships and the boats
Some are building monuments
Others, jotting down notes
Ev’rybody’s in despair
Every girl and boy
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here
Ev’rybody’s gonna jump for joy
Come all without, come all within
You’ll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

[Verse 2]
I like to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet
But guarding fumes and making haste
It ain’t my cup of meat
Everybody’s neath the trees
Feeding pigeons on a limb
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here
All the pigeons gonna run to him
Come all without, come all within
You’ll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

[Verse 3]
A cat’s meow and a cow’s moo, I can recite them all
Just tell me where it hurts yuh, honey
And I’ll tell you who to call
Nobody can get no sleep
There’s someone on ev’ryone’s toes
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here
Ev’rybody’s gonna wanna doze
Come all without, come all within
You’ll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

[Verse 1]
Why must you always try to make me over ?
Take me as I am or let me go
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover
Take me as I am or let me go

[Verse 2]
You're trying to reshape me in a moment
In the image of someone you used to know
I won't be a stand-in for an old love
Take me as I am or let me go

[Verse 3]
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me
Take me as I am or let me go
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me
Take me as I am or let me go

[Verse 4]
You're trying to reshape me in a mould love
In the image of someone you used to know
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love
Take me as I am or let me go

[Intro]
These are the words of a frontier lad
Who lost his love when he turned bad

[Verse 1]
Take a message to Mary
But don't tell here where I am
Take a message to Mary
But don't say I'm in a jam
You can tell her that I had to see the world
Tell her that my ship set sail
You can say she'd better not wait for me
But don't tell her I'm in jail, oh don't tell her I'm in jail

[Verse 2]
Take a message to Mary
But don't tell her what I've done
Please, don't mention the stage coach
And the shot from a carried gun
You better tell her that I had to change my plans
And cancel out the wedding-day
But please, don't mention the lonely cell
Where I'm gonna pine away, until my dying-day

[Verse 3]
Take a message to Mary
But don't tell her all you know
My heart is aching for Mary
Lord know I miss her so
Just tell her that I went to Timbukto
Tell her I'm searching for gold
You can say she better find someone new
To cherish and to hold, oh Lord, this cell is so cold

[Verse 1]
So run here baby, put your little hands in mine
I've got something to tell you
I know you're gonna change your mind
When things go wrong, so wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Verse 2]
I want you, baby, just to understand
I don't wanna be your boss, babe
I just wanna be your man
When things go wrong, so wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Verse 3]
Now when you go home, you don't have to get along
Come back to me, baby
Where I live, that's where you belong
When things go wrong, so wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Verse 4]
I love you baby, and you know that it's true
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby
Nothing in this world is like you
When things go wrong, so wrong with you
It hurts me too
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Verse 5]
So run here baby, put your little hand in mine
I got something to tell you, baby
I know that will change your mind
When things go wrong, so wrong with you
Don't you know it, don't you know it hurts me too

[Intro]
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin ?
Who's gonna let it roll ?
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin ?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul ?

[Verse 1]
Oh look, he's driving a long, long time
There he still sits on top of the hill
Well aching and jumping with all laid down
With all of them ladies you know he's lonely still
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin ?
Who's gonna let it roll ?
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin ?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul ?

[Verse 2]
Well knee deep in number, heavy in toil
Mighty mockingbird he still has such a heavy load
Beneath his boundaries but more if I can tell
With all of these travelling but I'm still on that road
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin ?
Who's gonna let it roll ?
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin ?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul ?

[Verse 1]
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble
Ancient footprints are everywhere
You can almost think that you’re seeing double
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room
Where I’ve got me a date with Botticelli’s niece
She promised that she’d be right there with me
When I paint my masterpiece

[Verse 2]
Oh, the hours I’ve spent inside the Coliseum
Dodging lions and wasting time
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see them
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
Someday, everything is going to be smooth like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece

[Bridge]
Sailing 'round the world in a dirty gondola
Oh, to be back in the land of Coca-Cola

[Verse 3]
Well, I left Rome and landed in Brussels
On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling mussels
Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside
Newspapermen eating candy
Had to be held down by big police
Someday, everything is going to be different
When I paint my masterpiece

[Verse 1]
Alberta let your hair hang low
Alberta let your hair hang low
I'll give you more gold
Than your apron can hold
If you'd only let your hair hang low

[Verse 2]
Alberta what's on your mind
Alberta what's on your mind
You keep me worried and bothered
All of the time
Alberta what's on your mind

[Verse 3]
Alberta don't you treat me unkind
Alberta don't you treat me unkind
Oh my heart is so sad
Cause I want you so bad
Alberta don't you treat me unkind

[Verse 4]
Alberta let your hair hang low
Alberta let your hair hang low
I'll give you more gold
Than your apron can hold
If you'll only let your hair hang low

[Verse 1]
If today was not a crooked highway
If tonight was not a crooked trail
If tomorrow wasn’t such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to you at all
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
And if I could hear her heart a-softly pounding
Yes, and only if she was lying by me
Then I’d lie in my bed once again....

[Verse 2]
I can’t see my reflection in the waters
I can’t speak the sounds that show no pain
I can’t hear the echo of my footsteps
Or can’t remember the sound of my own name
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
And if I could hear her heart a-softly pounding
Yes, and only if she was lying by me
Then I’d lie in my bed once again...

[Verse 3]
There’s beauty in that silver, singing river
There’s beauty in the sunrise in the sky
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
That I remember in my true love’s eyes
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
And if I could hear her heart a-softly pounding
Yes, and only if she was lying by me
Then I’d lie in my bed once again...

[Verse 1]
Went to see the gypsy
Staying in a big hotel
He smiled when he saw me coming
And he said, “Well, well, well”
His room was dark and crowded
Lights were low and dim
“How are you?” he said to me
I said it back to him

[Verse 2]
I went down to the lobby
To make a small call out
A pretty dancing girl was there
And she began to shout
“Go on back to see the gypsy
He can move you from the rear
Drive you from your fear
Bring you through the mirror
He did it in Las Vegas
And he can do it here”

[Verse 3]
Outside the lights were shining
On the river of tears
I watched them from the distance
With music in my ears

[Verse 4]
I went back to see the gypsy
It was nearly early dawn
The gypsy’s door was open wide
But the gypsy was gone
And that pretty dancing girl
She could not be found
So I watched that sun come rising
From that little Minnesota town

[Verse 1]
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh darling
Winterlude by the road tonight
Tonight there will be no quarreling
Everything is gonna be all right
Oh, I see by the angel beside me
That love has a reason to shine
You’re the one I adore, come over here and give me more
Then Winterlude, this dude thinks you’re fine

[Verse 2]
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple
Winterlude by the corn in the field
Winterlude, let’s go down to the chapel
Then come back and cook up a meal
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens
By the sun, near the old crossroads sign
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold
Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine

[Verse 3]
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy
Winterlude by the telephone wire
Winterlude, it’s making me lazy
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire
The moonlight reflects from the window
Where the snowflakes, they cover the sand
Come out tonight, everything will be tight
Winterlude, this dude thinks you’re grand

[Verse 1]
They say every man must need protection
They say every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above the wall

[Chorus]
I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

[Verse 2]
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
There's a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him cry so loud
Calling out that he's been framed
Yeah

[Chorus]
I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

[Verse 1]
If dogs run free, then why not we
Across the swooping plain?
My ears hear a symphony
Of two mules, trains and rain
The best is always yet to come
That’s what they explain to me
Just do your thing, you’ll be king
If dogs run free

[Verse 2]
If dogs run free, why not me
Across the swamp of time?
My mind weaves a symphony
And tapestry of rhyme
Oh, winds which rush my tale to thee
So it may flow and be
To each his own, it’s all unknown
If dogs run free

[Verse 3]
If dogs run free, then what must be
Must be, and that is all
True love can make a blade of grass
Stand up straight and tall
In harmony with the cosmic sea
True love needs no company
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole
If dogs run free

[Verse 1]
Can’t you hear that rooster crowing?
Rabbit running down across the road
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through
So happy just to see you smile
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning
On this new morning with you

[Verse 2]
Can’t you hear that motor turning?
Automobile coming into style
Coming down the road for a country mile or two
So happy just to see you smile
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning
On this new morning with you

[Bridge]
The night passed away so quickly
It always does when you’re with me

[Verse 3]
Can’t you feel that sun a-shining?
Groundhog running by the country stream
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true
So happy just to be alive
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning
On this new morning with you

[Verse 4]
So happy just to be alive
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning
On this new morning with you
New morning
Three angels up above the street
Each one playing a horn
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out
They’ve been there since Christmas morn

The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash
Then a lady in a bright orange dress
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels
The Tenth Avenue bus going west

The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around
A man with a badge skips by
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work
Nobody stops to ask why

The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Where the angels stand high on their poles
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
In this concrete world full of souls

The angels play on their horns all day
The whole earth in progression seems to pass by
But does anyone hear the music they play
Does anyone even try?

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
In this desert, in darkness
Lying with the gun across his chest
Pretending he's heartless
As the fire flashes in the sky

He was fragile and frozen
When the bullet took away his friend
And now he's somehow more broken

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
He's pulling his weapon to his side
Loading it full of his goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

He's pulling his weapon to his side
Loading it full of his goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Sweating and shaking
Lying with her hands across her chest
She wakes with her cravings
As the fire flashes in her eye
She was fragile and frozen
When the needle took away her friend
But now she's somehow more broken

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
She's pulling her weapon to her side
Loading it full of her goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

She's pulling her weapon to her side
Loading it full of her goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

[Post-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
With every battle he's chosing
With every fight he's losing
His enemy's not far behind

With every promise she's broken
With every lie she's spoken
Her enemy's not far behind

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
It's your time
It's your time
It's your time
It's your time!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
He's pulling his weapon to his side
Loading it full of his goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

She's pulling her weapon to her side
Loading it full of her goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
With every battle he's chosing
With every fight he's losing
His enemy's not far behind

With every promise she's broken
With every lie she's spoken
Her enemy's not far behind

[Verse 1]
Sign on the window says “Lonely”
Sign on the door said “No company allowed”
Sign on the street says “Y’ don’t own me”
Sign on a porch says “three’s a crowd”
Sign on a porch says “three’s a crowd”

[Verse 2]
Her and her boyfriend went to California
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune
My best friend said, “Now didn't I warn you?
Brighton girls are like the moon
Brighton girls are like the moon”

[Break]
Looks like a-nothing but rain
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street
Hope that it don’t sleet

[Verse 3]
Build me a cabin in Utah
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout
Have a bunch of kids who call me “Pa”
That must be what it’s all about
That must be what it’s all about

[Verse 1]
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run
I’m looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun
One more weekend, one more weekend with you
One more weekend, one more weekend’ll do

[Verse 2]
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck
We’ll fly over the ocean just like you suspect
One more weekend, one more weekend with you
One more weekend, one more weekend’ll do

[Verse 3]
We’ll fly the night away
Hang out the whole next day
Things will be okay
You wait and see
We’ll go someplace unknown
Leave all the children home
Honey, why not go alone
Just you and me

[Verse 4]
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood
I’m happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good
One more weekend, one more weekend with you
One more weekend, one more weekend’ll do (yes, you will!)

[Verse 5]
Like a needle in a haystack, I’m gonna find you yet
You’re the sweetest gone mama that this boy’s ever gonna get
One more weekend, one more weekend with you
One more weekend, one more weekend’ll do

[Harmonizing]

[Verse 1]
The man in me will do nearly any task
And as for compensation, there’s little he would ask
Take a woman like you
To get through to the man in me

[Verse 2]
Storm clouds are raging all around my door
I think to myself I might not take it anymore
Take a woman like your kind
To find the man in me

[Verse 3]
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Just to know that you are near
Sets my heart a-reeling
From my toes up to my ears

[Verse 4]
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein’ seen
But that’s just because he doesn’t want to turn into some machine
Took a woman like you
To get through to the man in me

[Verse 1]
Father of night, Father of day
Father who taketh the darkness away
Father who teacheth the bird to fly
Builder of rainbows up in the sky
Father of loneliness and pain
Father of love and Father of rain

[Verse 2]
Father of day, Father of night
Father of black, Father of white
Father who build the mountain so high
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky
Father of time, Father of dreams
Father who turneth the rivers and streams

[Verse 3]
Father of grain, Father of wheat
Father of cold and Father of heat
Father of air and Father of trees
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories
Father of minutes, Father of days
Father of whom we most solemnly praise

[Intro]
Everybody get up, WOO!
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1]
If you can't hear what I'm trying to say
If you can't read from the same page
Maybe I'm going deaf
Maybe I'm going blind
Maybe I'm out of my mind

[Bridge]
Ok, now he was close
Tried to domesticate you
But you're an animal
Baby, it's in your nature
Just let me liberate you
You don't need no papers
That man is not your maker
And that's why I'm gon' take a

[Hook]
Good girl
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
You're a good girl
Can't let it get past me
You're far from plastic
Talk about getting blasted
I hate these blurred lines
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
But you're a good girl
The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead, get at me

[Verse 2]
What do they make dreams for
When you got them jeans on
What do we need steam for
You the hottest bitch in this place
I feel so lucky, you wanna hug me
What rhymes with hug me
Hey!

[Bridge]
Ok, now he was close
Tried to domesticate you
But you're an animal
Baby, it's in your nature
Just let me liberate you
You don't need no papers
That man is not your maker
And that's why I'm gon' take a

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Good girlfriends, I had a few
But the best girlfriend I ever had is you
I thank God for my blessings, it began with you
So I put a ring on it and I married you
Come on and take a ride with me on a avenue
If you see it and you want it, you can have it boo
You have these other girls getting mad at you
Cause you got brains, looks and attitude
Cause my skill line is getting blurrier
I come home to my own Miss America
I mean this ain’t no ordinary love
Go and bring it here to my girl, hurry up
I'm watching, I'm waiting and they not you, so they hating
They just angry cause you ain't basic
And I'mma give you a standing ovation

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
There’s guns across the river aimin’ at ya
Lawman on your trail, he’d like to catch ya
Bounty hunters, too, they’d like to get ya
Billy, they don’t like you to be so free

[Verse 2]
Campaign’ out all night on the veranda
Dealing’ cards ’till dawn in the hacienda
Up to Boot Hill they’d like to send ya
Billy, don’t you turn your back on me

[Verse 3]
Playing’ around with some sweet señorita
Into her dark hallway she will lead ya
In some lonesome shadows she will greet ya
Billy, you’re so far away from home

[Verse 4]
There’s eyes behind the mirrors in empty places
Bullet holes and scars between the spaces
There’s always one more notch and ten more paces
Billy, and you’re walking’ all alone

[Verse 5]
They say that Pat Garrett’s got your number
So sleep with one eye open when you slumber
Every little sound just might be thunder
Thunder from the barrel of his gun

[Verse 5]
Guitars will play your grand finale
Down in some Tularosa alley
Maybe in the Rio Pecos valley
Billy, you’re so far away from home

[Verse 6]
There’s always some new stranger sneakin’ glances
Some trigger-happy fool willin’ to take chances
And some old whore from San Pedro to make advances
Advances on your spirit and your soul

[Verse 7]
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down
They’ve hired Pat Garrett to force a showdown
Billy, don’t it make ya feel so low-down
To be shot down by the man who was your friend?

[Verse 8]
Hang on to your woman if you got one
Remember in El Paso, once, you shot one
She may have been a whore, but she was a hot one
Billy, you have been running’ for so long

[Verse 9]
Guitars will play your grand finale
Down in some Tularosa alley
Maybe in the Rio Pecos valley
Billy, you’re so far away from home

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Mama, take this badge off of me
I can’t use it anymore
It’s getting dark, too dark to see
I feel I’m knockin' upon heaven’s door

[Chorus]
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

[Verse 2]
Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can’t shoot them anymore
That long black cloud is coming down
I feel I’m knockin' on heaven’s door

[Chorus]
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
There's guns across the river about to pound you
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you
Billy, they don't like you to be so free

[Verse 2]
Camping out all night on the veranda
Walking in the streets down by the hacienda
Up to Boot Hill the like to send you
Billy, don't you turn your back on me

[Verse 3]
There's mills inside the minds of crazy faces
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases
There is always one more notch in four more aces
Billy, and you're playing all alone

[Verse 4]
Playing around with some sweet signorita
Into her dark chamber she will greet you
In the shadows of the maizes she will lead you
Billy, and you're going all alone

[Verse 5]
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number
So sleep with one eye open, when you wander
Every little sound just might be thunder
Thunder from the barrel of his gun

[Verse 6]
There's always another stranger sneaking glances
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances
Advances on your spirit and your soul

[Verse 7]
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down
So they've hired mister Garrett, he'll force you to slow down
Billy, don't let it make you feel so low down
To be hunted by the man who was your friend

[Verse 8]
So hang on to your woman, if you got one
Remember in El Paso once you shot one
I'll be in Santa Fe about one
Billy, you've been running for so long

[Verse 9]
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Way down in some Tularosa alley
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley
Billy, you're so far away from home
Billy, you're so far away from home
Spend the night with some sweet señorita
Into her dark hallway she will lead you
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you
Billy, you’re so doggone far away from home

They say that Pat Garrett’s got your number
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber
Every little sound just might be thunder
Thunder from the barrel of his gun

Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow
Spending the time that you borrow
Figuring a way to get back home

[Verse 1]
On a night like this
So glad you came around
Hold on to me so tight
And heat up some coffee grounds
We got much to talk about
And much to reminisce
It sure is right
On a night like this

[Verse 2]
On a night like this
So glad you’re here to stay
Hold on to me, pretty miss
And say you’ll never go away to stray
Run your fingers down my spine
Bring me a touch of bliss
It sure feels right
On a night like this

[Verse 3]
On a night like this
I can’t get any sleep
The air is so cold outside
And the snow’s so deep
Build a fire, throw on logs
And listen to it hiss
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn
On a night like this

[Verse 4]
Put your body next to mine
And keep me company
There is plenty a-room for all
So please don’t elbow me

[Verse 5]
Let the four winds blow
Around this old cabin door
If I’m not too far off
I think we did this once before
There’s more frost on the window glass
With each new tender kiss
But it sure feels right
On a night like this

[Verse 1]
I’ve just reached a place
Where the willow don’t bend
There’s not much more to be said
It’s the top of the end
I’m going
I’m going
I’m gone

[Verse 2]
I’m closing’ the book
On the pages and the text
And I don’t really care
Oooh, what happens next
I’m just going
I’m going
I’m gone

[Verse 3]
I been hanging on threads
I have been playing’ it straight
Now, I’ve just got to cut loose
Before it gets late
So I’m going
I’m going
I’m gone

[Bridge]
Grandma said, “Boy, go and follow your heart
And you’ll be fine at the end of the line
All that’s gold doesn't shine
Don’t you and your one true love ever part”

[Verse 4]
I been walking the road
I been living on the edge
Now, I’ve just got to go
Before I get to the ledge
So I’m going
I’m just going
I’m gone

[Verse 1]
Tough Mama
Meat shaking on your bones
I’m gonna go down to the river and get some stones
Sister’s on the highway with that steel-drivin’ crew
Papa’s in the big house, his working’ days are through
Tough Mama
Can I blow a little smoke on you?

[Verse 2]
Dark Beauty
Won’t you move over and give me some room?
It’s my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies
Dark Beauty
With that long night’s journey in your eyes

[Verse 3]
Sweet Goddess
Born of a blinding light and a changing wind
Now, don’t be modest, you know who you are and where you’ve been
Jack the Cowboy went up north
He’s buried in your past
The Lone Wolf went out drinking
That was over pretty fast
Sweet Goddess
Your perfect stranger’s comin’ on in at last

[Verse 4]
Silver Angel
With the badge of the lonesome road written on your sleeve
I’d be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch
Sweet Goddess
It must be time to carve another notch

[Verse 5]
I’m crestfallen
The world of illusion's at my door
I ain’t a-hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore
The prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight
I’ve gained some recognition but I lost my appetite
Sweet Beauty
Meet me at the border late tonight

[Verse 1]
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be
Something’ that crossed over from another century?

[Verse 2]
Thought I’d shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walk-in’ the hills of old Duluth
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black night and then there was Ruth
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth

[Verse 3]
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings
Don’t have to look no further, you’re the soul of many things
I could say that I’d be faithful, I could say it in one sweet, easy breath
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death

[Verse 4]
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace
I was in a whirlwind, now I’m in some better place
My hand’s on the sabre and you’ve picked up the baton
Something’ there is about you that I can’t quite put my finger on

[Verse 1]
I hate myself for loving’ you and the weakness that it showed
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel
I hate myself for loving’ you and I’m glad the curtain fell

[Verse 2]
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
And the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed?
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin

[Verse 3]
Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped
Like a slave in orbit, he’s beaten ’till he’s tame
All for a moment’s glory and it’s a dirty, rotten shame

[Verse 4]
There are those who worship loneliness, I’m not one of them
In this age of fiberglass I’m searching for a gem
The crystal ball up on the wall hasn’t shown me nothing yet
I’ve paid the price of solitude, but at least I’m out of debt

[Verse 5]
Can’t recall a useful thing you ever did for me
’Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees
We stared into each other’s eyes ’till one of us would break
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?

[Verse 6]
So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I’m at
I hate myself for loving’ you, but I should get over that
You angel, you
Your essence got me under your wing
The way you walk and the way you talk
I feel I could almost sing

You angel, you
You're as fine as anything's fine
I just walk and watch you talk
With your memory of my mind

You know I can't sleep at night for trying
Yes I never did feel this way before
Never did get up and walk the floor
If this is love then gimme more
And more and more and more and more

You angel, you
You're as fine as can be
The way you walk and the way you talk
Is the way it ought to be
And oh, I can't sleep at night for trying
Never did feel this way before
Never did get up and walk the floor
If this is love then gimme more
And more and more and more

You angel, you
You got me under your wing
The way you walk and the way you talk
I swear it would make me sing

[Verse 1]
Twilight on the frozen lake
North wind about to break
On footprints in the snow
Silence down below

[Verse 2]
You’re beautiful beyond words
You’re beautiful to me
You can make me cry
Never say goodbye

[Verse 3]
Time is all I have to give
You can have it if you choose
With me you can live
Never say goodbye

[Verse 4]
My dreams are made of iron and steel
With a big bouquet
Of roses hanging down
From the heavens to the ground

[Verse 5]
The crashing waves roll over me
As I stand upon the sand
Wait for you to come
And grab hold of my hand

[Verse 6]
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue
You’ll change your last name, too
You’ve turned your hair to brown
Love to see it hanging’ down

[Verse 1]
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love
I love you more than money and more than the stars above
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea
Love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me

[Verse 2]
Ever since you walked right in, the circle’s been complete
I’ve said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street
To the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun
I love you more than ever and I haven’t yet begun

[Verse 3]
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live
When I was deep in poverty you taught me how to give
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul

[Verse 4]
You gave me babies one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife
My thoughts of you don’t ever rest, they’d kill me if I lie
I’d sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die

[Verse 5]
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth
We’ll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth
What’s lost is lost, we can’t regain what went down in the flood
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood

[Verse 6]
It’s never been my duty to remake the world at large
Nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge
’Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn’t bend
And if there is eternity I’d love you there again

[Verse 7]
Oh, can’t you see that you were born to stand by my side
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride
You’re the other half of what I am, you’re the missing piece
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn’t cease

[Verse 8]
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see
Just being’ next to you is a natural thing for me
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on
‘Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone

[Verse 1]
I pulled into Nazareth, was feeling about half past dead;
I just need some place where I can lay my head
"Hey, mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?"
He just grinned and shook my hand, and "No!", was all he said

[Chorus]
Take a load off Fanny, take a load for free;
Take a load off Fanny, And (and) (and) you can put the load right on me

[Verse 2]
I picked up my bag, I went looking for a place to hide;
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walking side by side
I said, "Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown."
She said, "I gotta go, but m'friend can stick around."

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothing you can say
It's just ol' Luke, and Luke's waitin' on the Judgement Day
"Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?"
He said, "Do me a favor, son, woncha stay and keep Anna Lee company?"

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog
He said, "I will fix your rack, if you'll take Jack, my dog."
I said, "Wait a minute, Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man."
He said, "That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can."

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Catch a cannon ball now, t'take me down the line
My bag is sinking' low and I do believe it's time
To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I’ve seen love go by my door
It’s never been this close before
Never been so easy or so slow
I've been shooting in the dark too long
When something’s not right, it’s wrong
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Verse 2]
Dragon clouds so high above
I’ve only known careless love
It always just hit me from below
But this time 'round it’s more correct
Right on target, so direct
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Verse 3]
Purple clover, Queen Anne's lace
Crimson hair across your face
You could make me cry, if you don’t know
Can’t remember what I was thinking of
You might be spoilin’ me too much, love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Bridge 1]
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
Blue river running slow and lazy
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time

[Verse 4]
Situations have ended sad
Relationships have all been bad
Mine’ve been like Verlaine’s and Rimbaud
But there’s no way I can compare
All them scenes to this affair
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Bridge 2]
You're gonna make me wonder what I’m doin’
Staying far behind without you
You're gonna make me wonder what I’m sayin’
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to

[Verse 5]
I’ll look for you in old Honolulu
San Francisco or Ashtabula
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know
But I’ll see you in the sky above
In the tall grass, in the ones I love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Verse 1]
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha
Honey, we could be in Kansas
By time the snow begins to thaw

[Verse 2]
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
But you wouldn’t know it by me
Every day's been darkness since you been gone

[Verse 3]
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind
Well, I feel just like that rooster
Honey, ya treat me so unkind

[Verse 4]
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above
Well, you know I even outran the hound dogs
Honey, you know I've earned your love

[Verse 5]
Look at the sun sinking like a ship
Look at the sun sinking like a ship
Ain't that just like my heart, babe
When you kissed my lips?

[Verse 1]
The festival was over, and the boys were all planning for a fall
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down
Anyone with any sense had already left town
He was standing in the doorway looking like the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 2]
He moved across the mirrored room, “Set it up for everyone,” he said
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads
Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin
“Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?”
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 3]
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide
A gentle breeze was blowing, you could feel it from inside
Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 4]
Big Jim was no one’s fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine
He made his usual entrance looking so dandy and so fine
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 5]
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town
She slipped in through the side door looking like a queen without a crown
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear
“Sorry, darling, that I’m late,” but he didn't seem to hear
He was staring into space over at the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 6]
“I know I’ve seen that face somewhere,” Big Jim was thinking to himself
“Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody’s shelf”
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him
Staring at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 7]
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere
But she’d never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 8]
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined
The drilling in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind
It was known all around that Lily had Jim’s ring
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king
No, nothing ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 9]
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim’s wife
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died
She was gazing to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 10]
Lily took her dress off, buried it away
“Has your luck run out?” she laughed at him, “Well, I guess you must
Have known it would someday
Be careful not to touch the wall, there’s a brand-new coat of paint
I’m glad to see you’re still alive, you’re looking like a saint”
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 11]
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair
“There’s something funny going on,” he said, “I can just feel it in the air”
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge was drunk
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk
There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 12]
No one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
And Big Jim was standing there, ya couldn't say surprised
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes
She was with Big Jim but she was leaning to the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 13]
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
And cleaned out the bank safe, it’s said that they got off with quite a haul
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
For one more member who had business back in town
But they couldn't go no further without the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 14]
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink
The hanging judge was sober, he hadn't had a drink
The only person on the scene missing was the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 15]
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said, “Closed for repair”
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair
She was thinking ’bout her father, who she very rarely saw
Thinking ’bout Rosemary and thinking about the law
But most of all she was thinking ’bout the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 1]
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier
She left here last early Spring, is livin' there, I hear
Say for me that I'm all right though things get kind of slow
She might think that I've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so

[Verse 2]
We had a falling out, like lovers often will
And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill
And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart

[Verse 3]
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me
Always have respected her for doing what she did and gettin' free
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay

[Verse 4]
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft

[Verse 5]
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast
If she's passin' back this way, I'm not that hard to find
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time

[Verse 1]
Buckets of rain
Buckets of tears
Got all them buckets comin’ out of my ears
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand
You got all the love
Honey baby, I can stand

[Verse 2]
I been meek
And hard like an oak
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear
If you want me
Honey baby, I’ll be here

[Verse 3]
I like your smile
And your fingertips
I like the way that you move your hips
I like the cool way you look at me
Everything about you is bringing me misery

[Verse 4]
Little red wagon
Little red bike
I ain’t no monkey, but I know what I like
I like the way you love me strong and slow
I’m taking you with me
Honey baby, when I go

[Verse 5]
Life is sad
Life is a bust
All you can do is do what you must
You do what you must do, and you do it well
I do it for you
Honey baby, can’t you tell?

[Chorus]
I got a wife and five little chilling
I'm going to take a trip on the big McMillan
With Saro Jane
Saro Jane
I have nothing to do
But to set down and sing
And rock about my Saro Jane

[Verse 1]
The boiler busted and the whistle squall
The Captain has gone through the hole-in-the-wall
Oh Saro Jane
Saro Jane
I have nothing to do
But to set down and sing
And rock about my Saro Jane

[Verse 2]
The engine give a crack and the whistle gave a squall
The engineer gone to the hole-in-the-wall
Saro Jane
Saro Jane
I have nothing to do
But to set down and sing
And rock about my Saro Jane

[Verse 3]
Yankee built boats to shoot them Rebels
My gun's steady going to hold it level
Saro Jane
Saro Jane
But to set down and sing
And rock about my Saro Jane

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Broke my heart, lost my soul
Adios, mi corazón
Spanish is the loving tongue
Soft as music, light as spring
It was a girl I learned it from
Living down Sonora way
Well, I don't look much like a lover
Still I say her love words over
Mostly when I'm all alone
Mi amor, mi corazón

[Verse 2]
Haven't seen her since that night
I can't cross the line you know
They want me for a gambling fight
Like as not it's better so
Still I always kind of missed her
Since that last sad night I kissed her
Broke her heart, lost my own
Adios, mi corazón
Broke her heart, lost my own
Adios, mi corazón
Adios, mi corazón
Adios, mi corazón

[Verse 1]
Now and then there's a fool such as I
Pardon me if I'm sentimental, came to say goodbye
Don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should I cry
When you are gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I

[Verse 2]
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now you happened to be untrue
I am a fool but I love you, dear, yes I will until the day I die
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I

[Verse 3]
Pardon me if I'm sentimental, came to say goodbye
Don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should I cry
When you are gone, when you are gone, I will dream a little
I will dream as years go by
Now and then, now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I

[Verse 4]
Now and then there's a fool, a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through
I am a fool, yes, but I love you dear, I will love you dear
Till the day, till the day I die
Now and then, now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I

[Verse 1]
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
A pink hotel, a boutique and a swinging hot spot
Don't it always go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone ?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot

[Verse 2]
They took all the trees, they put them in a tree museum
They charged the people a dollar and a half just to see them
Don't it always go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone ?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot

[Verse 3]
Hey farmer, farmer, put away that D.D.T
Give me spots on my apples but leave me the birds and the bees, please
Don't it always go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone ?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot

[Verse 4]
Late last night I heard my screen door slam
A big yellow bulldozer took away my house and land
Don't it always go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone ?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot

[Verse 1]
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love, fare thee well but for a while
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann

[Verse 2]
Ten thousand miles away from home, ten thousand miles or more
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann

[Verse 3]
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high, she'll surely turn to white
If never I prove false to you
Let the day turn to night, my dear, Mary Ann

[Verse 4]
If I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
And a great big bowl for two to mix it in
I'd pour a drink for you my dear, Mary Ann
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you my dear, Mary Ann

[Verse 1]
Wise men say, only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay, will it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you ?

[Verse 2]
Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be
Take my hand, take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you

[Verse 1]
Gather round you people and a story I will tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona land
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Till their white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed
Now Ira's folks were hungry and their farms when crops of weeds
But when war came he volunteers and forgot, the white man's greed
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war

[Verse 2]
They started up Iwo Jima Hill, 250 men
But only 27 lived to walk back down that hill again
And when the fight was over and the old glory raised
One of the men who held it high was the Indian Ira Hayes
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war

[Verse 3]
Now Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand
But he was just a Pima Indian, no money crops, no chance
And at home nobody cared what Ira had done and the wind did the Indian's dance
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war

[Verse 4]
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone
He died drunk early one morning, alone in the land he had fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war

[Outro]
Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
I knew a man Bojangles and he'd dance for you in worn out shoes
Silver hair, ragged shirt and baggy pants, that old soft shoe
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he lightly touch down?
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance

I met him in a cell in New Orleans, I was down and out
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughing slapped his leg stale
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance

He said the name Bojangles and he danced a lick all across the cell
He grabbed his pants for a better stance
Oh, he jumped so high and he clicked up his heels
He let go laugh, he let go laugh, shook back his clothes all around
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance, yeah, dance

He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke with tears of 15 years of how his dog and him
Just traveled about
But his dog up and died, he up and died
And after 20 years he still grieves
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks
For drinks and tips
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars
Because I drinks a bit"
He shook his head, yes, he shook his head
I heard someone ask him, "Please ...
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance, dance
Mr. Bojangles, dance"

[Verse 1]
When first I came to Louisville, some pleasure there to find
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips, like arrows pierced my breast
And the name she bore was Flora, the lily of the west

[Verse 2]
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find
But she turned unto another man whose sore distressed my mind
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest
Then go, my lovely Flora, the lily of the west

[Verse 3]
Away down in yonder shady grove, a man of high degree
Conversing with my Flora there, it seemed so strange to me
And the answer that she gave to him it sore did me oppress
I was betrayed by Flora, the lily of the west

[Verse 4]
I stepped up my rival, dagger in my hand
I seized him by the collar, and body made him stand
Seeing mad by desperation I pierced him to the breast
All this for lovely Flora, the lily of the west

[Verse 5]
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the west

[Verse 1]
I laid on a dune, I looked at the sky
When the children were babies and played on the beach
You came up behind me, I saw you go by
You were always so close and still within reach

[Chorus]
Sara, Sara
Whatever made you want to change your mind?
Sara, Sara
So easy to look at, so hard to define

[Verse 2]
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand
They run to the water their buckets to fill
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
As they follow each other back up the hill

[Chorus]
Sara, Sara
Sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life
Sara, Sara
Radiant jewel, mystical wife

[Verse 3]
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White
You in the marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar

[Chorus]
Sara, oh Sara
It’s all so clear, I could never forget
Sara, oh Sara
Loving you is the one thing I’ll never regret

[Verse 4]
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells
I’d taken the cure and had just gotten through
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel
Writing “Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands” for you

[Chorus]
Sara, Sara
Wherever we travel we’re never apart
Sara, oh Sara
Beautiful lady, so dear to my heart

[Verse 5]
How did I meet you? I don’t know
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm

[Chorus]
Sara, oh Sara
Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress
Sara, oh Sara
You must forgive me my unworthiness

[Verse 6]
Now the beach is deserted except for some kelp
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore
You always responded when I needed your help
You give me a map and a key to your door

[Chorus]
Sara, oh Sara
Glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow
Sara, oh Sara
Don’t ever leave me, don’t ever go

[Verse 1]
Up on the white veranda
She wears a necktie and a Panama hat
Her passport shows a face
From another time and place
She looks nothing like that
And all the remnants of her recent past
Are scattered in the wild wind
She walks across the marble floor
Where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in
She smiles, walks the other way
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away
From Black Diamond Bay

[Verse 2]
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down
And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write
“Pardon, monsieur,” the desk clerk says
Carefully removes his fez
“Am I hearing you right?”
And as the yellow fog is lifting
The Greek is quickly heading for the second floor
She passes him on the spiral staircase
Thinking he’s the Soviet Ambassador
She starts to speak, but he walks away
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway
On Black Diamond Bay

[Verse 3]
A soldier sits beneath the fan
Doing business with a tiny man who sells him a ring
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out
The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout
“Can you see anything?”
Then the Greek appears on the second floor
In his bare feet with a rope around his neck
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle
Says, “Open up another deck”
But the dealer says, “Attendez-vous, s’il vous plait”
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away
From Black Diamond Bay

[Verse 4]
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh
As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough
He tried to grab the woman’s hand
Said, “Here’s a ring, it cost a grand”
She said, “That ain't enough”
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags
While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb
She passed the door that the Greek had locked
Where a handwritten sign read, “Do Not Disturb”
She knocked upon it anyway
As the sun went down and the music did play
On Black Diamond Bay

[Verse 5]
“I’ve got to talk to someone quick!”
But the Greek said, “Go away,” and he kicked the chair to the floor
He hung there from the chandelier
She cried, “Help, there’s danger near
Please open up the door!”
Then the volcano erupted
And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner
Thinking of forbidden love
But the desk clerk said, “It happens every day”
As the stars fell down and the fields burned away
On Black Diamond Bay

[Verse 6]
As the island slowly sank
The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room
The dealer said, “It’s too late now
You can take your money, but I don’t know how
You’ll spend it in the tomb”
The tiny man bit the soldier’s ear
As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew
While she’s out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her
“My darling, je vous aime beaucoup”
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away
From Black Diamond Bay

[Verse 7]
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A
Watching old Cronkite on the seven o’clock news
It seems there was an earthquake that
Left nothing but a Panama hat
And a pair of old Greek shoes
Didn’t seem like much was happening
So I turned it off and went to grab another beer
Seems like every time you turn around
There’s another hard-luck story that you’re going to hear
And there’s really nothing anyone can say
And I never did plan to go anyway
To Black Diamond Bay

[Verse 1]
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun
Dust on my face and my cape
Me and Magdalena on the run
I think this time we shall escape

Sold my guitar to the baker’s son
For a few crumbs and a place to hide
But I can get another one
And I’ll play for Magdalena as we ride

[Chorus]
No Ilores, mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango
Agarrame, mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango

[Verse 2]
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people
Hoof beats like castanets on stone
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple
Then I see the bloody face of Ramon
Was it me that shot him down in the Cantina
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena
The dogs are barking and what’s done is done

[Chorus]
No Ilores, mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango
Agarrame, mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango

[Verse 3]
In the corrida we’ll sit in the shade
And watch the young torero stand alone
We’ll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
When they rode with Villa into Torreón

Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
In the little church this side of town
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold
You’ll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown

The way is long but the end is near
Already the fiesta has begun
The face of God will appear
With His serpent eyes of obsidian

[Chorus]
No Ilores, mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango
Agarrame, mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango

[Verse 4]
Was that the thunder that I heard?
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain
Come sit by me, don’t say a word
Oh, can it be that I am slain?

Quick, Magdalena, take my gun
Look up in the hills, that flash of light
Aim well my little one
We may not make it through the night

[Chorus]
No Ilores, mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango
Agarrame, mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango

[Verse 1]
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion
Always on the outside of whatever side there was
When they asked him why it had to be that way, “Well,” he answered
“Just because”

Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last
They called Joe “Crazy,” the baby they called “Kid Blast”
Some say they lived off gambling and runnin’ numbers too
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue

[Chorus]
Joey, Joey
King of the streets, child of clay
Joey, Joey
What made them want to come and blow you away?

[Verse 2]
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof
The war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners
They stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs

The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim
“Let’s blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame”
But Joey stepped up, and he raised his hands, said, “We’re not those kind of men
It’s peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again”

[Chorus]
Joey, Joey
King of the streets, child of clay
Joey, Joey
What made them want to come and blow you away?

[Verse 3]
The police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith
They got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with
“What time is it?” said the judge to Joey when they met
“Five to ten,” said Joey. The judge says, “That’s exactly what you get”

He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike
His closest friends were black men because they seemed to understand
What it’s like to be in society with a shackle on your hand
When they let him out in ’71 he’d lost a little weight
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great
He tried to find the way back into the life he left behind
To the boss he said, “I have returned and now I want what’s mine”

[Chorus]
Joey, Joey
King of the streets, child of clay
Joey, Joey
What made them want to come and blow you away?

[Verse 4]
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun
“I’m around too many children,” he’d say, “they should never know of one”
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe
Emptied out the register, said, “Tell them it was Crazy Joe”

One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork
He pushed the table over to protect his family
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy

[Chorus]
Joey, Joey
King of the streets, child of clay
Joey, Joey
What made them want to come and blow you away?

[Verse 5]
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep
I heard his best friend Frankie say, “He is not dead, he’s just asleep”
Then I saw the old man’s limousine head back towards the grave
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save

The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born
And someday if God’s in heaven overlooking His preserve
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve

[Chorus]
Joey, Joey
King of the streets, child of clay
Joey, Joey
What made them want to come and blow you away?

[Verse 1]
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms
You should not treat me like a stranger
Our Father would not like the way that you act
And you must realize the danger

[Verse 2]
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you
And one deserving of affection?
And is our purpose not the same on this earth
To love and follow His direction?

[Verse 3]
We grew up together
From the cradle to the grave
We died and were reborn
And then mysteriously saved

[Verse 4]
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door
Don’t turn away, you’ll create sorrow
Time is an ocean but it ends at the shore
You may not see me tomorrow

[Verse 1]
Your breath is sweet
Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth
On the pillow where you lie
But I don't sense affection
No gratitude or love
Your loyalty is not to me
But to the stars above

[Chorus]
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below

[Verse 2]
Your daddy, he's an outlaw
And a wanderer by trade
He'll teach you how to pick and choose
And how to throw the blade
He oversees his kingdom
So no stranger does intrude
His voice, it trembles as he calls out
For another plate of food

[Chorus]
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below

[Verse 3]
Your sister sees the future
Like your mama and yourself
You've never learned to read or write
There's no books upon your shelf
And your pleasure knows no limits
Your voice is like a meadowlark
But your heart is like an ocean
Mysterious and dark

[Chorus]
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below

[Verse 1]
I like to spend some time in Mozambique
The sunny sky is aqua blue
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek
It’s very nice to stay a week or two
And maybe fall in love, just me and you

[Instrument Break]

[Verse 2]
There’s lot of pretty girls in Mozambique
And plenty time for good romance
And everybody likes to stop and speak
To give the special one you seek a chance
Or maybe say hello with just a glance

[Instrument Break]

[Verse 3]
Lying next to her by the ocean
Reaching out and touching her hand
Whispering your secret emotion
Magic in a magical land

[Verse 4]
And when it’s time for leaving Mozambique
To say goodbye to sand and sea
You turn around to take a final peek
And you see why it’s so unique to be
Among the lovely people living free
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique

[Instrument break]

[Verse 1]
I married Isis on the fifth day of May
But I could not hold on to her very long
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong

[Verse 2]
I came to a high place of darkness and light
Dividing line ran through the center of town
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down

[Verse 3]
A man in the corner approached me for a match
I knew right away, he was not ordinary
He said “Are you looking for something easy to catch?”
Said “I got no money”
He said “That ain't necessary”

[Verse 4]
We set out that night, for the cold in the North
I gave him my blanket, and he gave me his word
I said “Where are we going?” He said we’d be back by the fourth
I said “That’s the best news that I’ve ever heard”

[Verse 5]
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold
I was thinking about diamonds, and the world’s biggest necklace
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless

[Verse 6]
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
And things would be different the next time we wed
If I only could hang on and just be her friend
I still can’t remember all the best things she said

[Verse 7]
We came to the pyramids, all embedded in ice
He said “There’s a body I’m trying to find
If I carry it out it’ll bring a good price”
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind

[Verse 8]
The wind it was a-howlin', and the snow was outrageous
We chopped through the night
And we chopped through the dawn
When he died, I was hopin' that it wasn’t contagious
But I made up my mind that I had to go on

[Verse 9]
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I’d been had
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly
When I took up his offer I must have been mad

[Verse 10]
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside
Threw him down in the hole, and I put back the cover
I said a quick prayer, then I felt satisfied
Then I rode back to find Isis, just to tell her I love her

[Verse 11]
She was there, in the meadow, where the creek used to rise
Blinded by sleep, and in need of a bed
I came in from the East, with the sun in my eyes
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead

[Verse 12]
She said “Where you been?”
I said “No place special”
She said “You look different”
I said “Well... I guess”
She said “You been gone”
I said “That’s only natural”
She said “You going to stay?”
I said “If you want me to, yes"

[Verse 13]
Isis, oh, Isis, you mystical child
What drives me to you is what drives me insane
I still can remember the way that you smiled
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain

[Verse 1]
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer
She broke her leg and needed shooting
I swear it hurt me more than it could ever have hurted her

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wonder what’s going on with Miss X
Sometimes I wonder what’s going on with Miss X
She got such a sweet disposition
I never know what the poor girl’s gonna do to me next

[Verse 3]
I got a new pony, she knows how to fox-trot, lope and pace
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to fox-trot, lope and pace
She got great big hind legs
Long black shaggy hair hanging in her face

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 4]
Everybody says you’re using’ voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves
Oh well, everybody says you’re using’ voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves
Oh, baby, that god you been prayin’ to
Gonna given you back what you’re wishing’ on someone else

[Verse 5]
Come over here pony, I-hi want to climb up on top on you, well
Come over here pony, I wanna climb up one time on you
You’re oh so nasty and so bad
I swear I love you yes I do

[Verse 1]
In death, you face life with a child and a wife
Who sleep-walks through your dreams into walls
You’re a soldier of mercy, you’re cold and you curse
“He who cannot be trusted must fall”

[Verse 2]
Loneliness, tenderness, high society, notoriety
You fight for the throne and you travel alone
Unknown as you slowly sink
And there’s no time to think

[Verse 3]
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity
In secret, for pieces of change
The empress attracts you but oppression distracts you
And it makes you feel violent and strange

[Verse 4]
Memory, ecstasy, tyranny, hypocrisy
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss
In the valley of the missing link
And you have no time to think

[Verse 5]
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you
Her worst is better than best
I’ve seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes
And I feel so depressed

[Verse 6]
China doll, alcohol, duality, mortality
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you
Like the plague, with a dangerous wink
And there’s no time to think

[Verse 7]
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you
Where the lion lies down with the lamb
I’d have paid off the traitor and killed him much later
But that’s just the way that I am

[Verse 8]
Paradise, sacrifice, mortality, reality
But the magician is quicker and his game
Is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
And there’s no time to think

[Verse 9]
Anger and jealousy’s all that he sells us
He’s content when you’re under his thumb
Madmen oppose him, but your kindness throws him
To survive it you play deaf and dumb

[Verse 10]
Equality, liberty, humility, simplicity
You glance through the mirror and there’s eyes staring clear
At the back of your head as you drink
And there’s no time to think

[Verse 11]
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow
Will offer their heads for a prayer
You can’t find no salvation, you have no expectations
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere

[Verse 12]
Mercury, gravity, nobility, humility
You know you can’t keep her and the water gets deeper
That is leading you onto the brink
But there’s no time to think

[Verse 13]
You’ve murdered your vanity, buried your sanity
For pleasure you must now resist
Lovers obey you but they cannot sway you
They’re not even sure you exist

[Verse 14]
Socialism, hypnotism, patriotism, materialism
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws
And the sound of the keys as they clink
But there’s no time to think

[Verse 15]
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl
With the rose in her hair
Starlight in the East and you’re finally released
You’re stranded but with nothing to share

[Verse 16]
Loyalty, unity, epitome, rigidity
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille
’Neath the moon shining’ bloody and pink
And there’s no time to think

[Verse 17]
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you
But no, you will not be deceived
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt
You can give but you cannot receive

[Verse 18]
No time to choose when the truth must die
No time to lose or say goodbye
No time to prepare for the victim that’s there
No time to suffer or blink
And no time to think

[Verse 1]
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe
But you’re back where you belong
Go get me my pistol, babe
Honey, I can’t tell right from wrong

[Chorus]
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying
Baby, please stop crying
You know, I know, the sun will always shine
So baby, please stop crying ’cause it’s tearing up my mind

[Verse 2]
Go down to the river, babe
Honey, I will meet you there
Go down to the river, babe
Honey, I will pay your fare

[Chorus]
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying
Baby, please stop crying
You know, I know, the sun will always shine
So baby, please stop crying ’cause it’s tearing up my mind

[Verse 3]
If you’re looking for assistance, babe
Or if you just want some company
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to
Honey, come and see about me

[Chorus]
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying
Baby, please stop crying
You know, I know, the sun will always shine
So baby, please stop crying ’cause it’s tearing up my mind

[Verse 4]
You been hurt so many times
And I know what you’re thinking of
Well, I don’t have to be no doctor, babe
To see that you’re madly in love

[Chorus]
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying
Baby, please stop crying
You know, I know, the sun will always shine
So baby, please stop crying ’cause it’s tearing up my mind

[Verse 1]
Do you love me
Or are you just extending goodwill?
Do you need me half as bad as you say
Or are you just feeling guilt?

[Chorus 1]
I’ve been burned before and I know the score
So you won’t hear me complain
Will I be able to count on you
Or is your love in vain?

[Verse 2]
Are you so fast that you cannot see
That I must have solitude?
When I am in the darkness
Why do you intrude?

[Chorus 2]
Do you know my world, do you know my kind
Or must I explain?
Will you let me be myself
Or is your love in vain?

[Bridge]
Well I’ve been to the mountain and I’ve been in the wind
I’ve been in and out of happiness
I have dined with kings, I’ve been offered wings
And I’ve never been too impressed

[Verse 3]
All right, I’ll take a chance
I will fall in love with you
If I’m a fool you can have the night
You can have the morning too

[Chorus 3]
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow
Do you understand my pain?
Are you willing to risk it all
Or is your love in vain?

[Chorus 3]
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow
Do you understand my pain?
Are you willing to risk it all
Or is your love in vain?

[Verse 1]
I’m getting weary looking in my baby’s eyes
When she’s near me she’s so hard to recognize
I finally realize there’s no room for regret
True love, true love, true love tends to forget

[Verse 2]
Hold me, baby be near
You told me that you’d be sincere
Every day of the year’s like playing’ Russian roulette
True love, true love, true love tends to forget

[Chorus]
I was lying’ down in the reeds without any oxygen
I saw you in the wilderness among the men
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again
All you got to do is wait and I’ll tell you when

[Verse 3]
You’re a tearjerker, baby, but I’m under your spell
You’re a hard worker, baby, and I know you well
But this weekend in hell is making me sweat
True love, true love, true love tends to forget

[Chorus]
I was lying’ down in the reeds without any oxygen
I saw you in the wilderness among the men
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again
All you got to do is wait and I’ll tell you when

[Verse 4]
You belong to me, baby, without any doubt
Don’t forsake me, baby, don’t sell me out
Don’t keep me knocking’ about from Mexico to Tibet
True love, true love, true love tends to forget

[Verse 1]
I think we better talk this over
Maybe when we both get sober
You’ll understand I’m only a man
Doing’ the best that I can

[Verse 2]
This situation can only get rougher
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Let’s call it a day, go our own different ways
Before we decay

[Chorus 1]
You don’t have to be afraid of looking into my face
We’ve done nothing to each other time will not erase

[Verse 3]
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing
I took a chance, got caught in the trance
Of a downhill dance

[Verse 4]
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
I’m exiled, you can’t convert me
I’m lost in the haze of your delicate ways
With both eyes glazed

[Chorus 2]
You don’t have to yearn for love, you don’t have to be alone
Somewheres in this universe there’s a place that you can call home

[Verse 5]
I guess I’ll be leaving tomorrow
If I have to beg, steal or borrow
It’d be great to cross paths in a day and a half
Look at each other and laugh

[Verse 6]
But I don’t think it’s liable to happen
Like the sound of one hand clapping’
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept
’Neath the bed where we slept

[Verse 7]
Don’t think of me and fantasize on what we never had
Be grateful for what we’ve shared together and be glad
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Eventually we’ll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope

[Verse 8]
Oh, babe, time for a new transition
I wish I was a magician
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond
That we’ve both gone beyond

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Time - He's waiting in the wings
He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me, Boy
Time - He flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me, Boy
Time - In Quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time
The sniper in the brain
Regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain
And many other last names
Well, I look at my watch it says 9:25 and I think
"Oh God! I'm still alive."

[Chorus]
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
Li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li
Li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li
Li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li
Li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li

[Verse 2]
You - Are not a victim
You - Just scream with boredom!
You - Are not evicting time...

[Bowie breathing heavily]
Chimes - Goddamn, you're looking old
You'll freeze and catch a cold
'Cause you've left your coat behind
Take your time
Breaking up is hard
But keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams
I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind
But love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed
Your park was real and dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now
Smiling through this darkness
But all I have to give
Is guilt for dreaming

[Chorus]
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
Li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li
Li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li
Li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li
Li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li
Li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, yes, time!

[Verse 1]
There’s a long-distance train rolling through the rain
Tears on the letter I write
There’s a woman I long to touch and I miss her so much
But she’s drifting like a satellite

[Verse 2]
There’s a neon light ablaze in a green smoky haze
Laughter down on Elizabeth Street
And a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat

[Verse 3]
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise
But he practiced what he preached from the heart
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me
The time and the place that we'd part

[Verse 4]
There’s a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
And a longtime golden-haired stripper onstage
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page
Of a book that nobody can write
Oh, where are you tonight?

[Verse 5]
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure
To live it you had to explode
In that last hour of need, we entirely agreed
Sacrifice was the code of the road

[Verse 6]
I left town at dawn, with Marcel and St. John
Strong men belittled by doubt
I couldn’t tell her what my private thoughts were
But she had some way of finding them out

[Verse 7]
He took dead-center aim but he missed just the same
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
And discovered her invisible self

[Verse 8]
There’s a lion in the road, there’s a demon escaped
There’s a million dreams gone, there’s a landscape being raped
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape
I won’t but then again, maybe I might
Oh, if I could just find you tonight

[Verse 9]
I fought with my twin, that enemy within
’Til both of us fell by the way
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
While the law looks the other way

[Verse 10]
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes
The man you were lovin’ could never get clean
It felt out of place, my foot in his face
But he should-a stayed where his money was green

[Verse 11]
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
With the juice running down my leg
Then I dealt with your boss, who’d never known about loss
Who always was too proud to beg

[Verse 12]
There’s a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
And a pathway that leads up to the stars
If you don’t believe there’s a price for this sweet paradise
Just remind me to show you the scars

[Verse 13]
There’s a new day at dawn and I’ve finally arrived
If I’m there in the morning, baby, you’ll know I’ve survived
I can’t believe it, I can’t believe I’m alive
But without you it just doesn’t seem right
Oh, where are you tonight?

Ready to play with that spot that you tingle

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull]
Uh got a dingo, she’s a star, Ringo

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull]
She got me up like the Eiffel tower
No Paris, momma, you can fuck like the rabbits
But no diamonds, no carats
She asked if I was single, I said of course not
And she loved it
Next thing you know, we were both having fun in public

[Chorus: The Wanted]
All I wanna do is have some fun

It’s all I want
I got a feeling, that I’m not the only one
It’s all I want
And I got a feeling, that you’re gonna give me some
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling, that I’m not the only one
All I gotta do is take you home
I got a feeling, this party has just begun
It’s all I want (Want, want)
I got a feeling, that I’m not the only one
It’s all I want (Want, want)
And I got a feeling, that you’re gonna give me some
It’s all I want (Want, want)

[Outro: The Wanted & Pitbull]
Baby, it’s all I want
Baby, It’s all I want
It’s all I want
Baby, it’s all I want

[Verse 1]
I saw your face
Elegant and tired
Cut up from the chase
Still, I so admired

[Verse 2]
Bloodshot your smile
Delicate and wild
Give me she-wolf style
Rip right through me

[Pre-Chorus]
Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her, I've got her on my mind
Nothing better, the feelin' is so fine
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow

[Chorus]
(Ooh) Come on, baby, 'cause there's no name for
(Ooh-ooh) Give it up and I got what I came for
(Ooh-ooh) Universally speaking, I...
(Ooh) Take it back and you make me nervous
(Ooh-ooh) Nothing better than love and service
(Ooh-ooh) Universally speaking, I...
(Ahhh) Win in the long run

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I saw your crime
Dying to get high
Two of a kind
Beats all hands tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her, I've got her on my mind
All the better, to make it so fine
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow

[Chorus]
(Ooh) Come on, baby, 'cause there's no name for
(Ooh-ooh) Give it up and I got what I came for
(Ooh-ooh) Universally speaking, I...
(Ooh) Take it back and you make me nervous
(Ooh-ooh) Nothing better than love and service
(Ooh-ooh) Universally speaking, I...
(Ahhh) Win in the long run

[Bridge]
Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her, I've got her on my mind
Nothing better, the feelin' is so fine
Simply put I saw your love stream flow
Simply put I saw your love stream flow
Let's go

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
I'm an ocean in your bedroom
Make you feel warm, make you wanna resume
Now we know it all for sure

[Verse 2]
I'm a dance hall, dirty breakbeat
Make the snow fall up from underneath your feet
Not alone, I'll be there, tell me when you want to go

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I'm a meth lab, first rehab
Take it all off and step inside the running cab
There's a love that knows the way

[Verse 4]
I'm the rainbow in your jail cell
All the memories of everything you've ever smelled
Not alone, I'll be there, tell me when you want to go

[Chorus]
(So)
(Sideways fallin', more will be revealed, my friend)
(Sideways fallin')
Don't forget me, I can't hide it
(More will be revealed, my friend)
Come again, get me excited

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
I'm an inbred and a pothead
Two legs that you spread inside the tool shed
Now we know it all for sure

[Verse 6]
I could show you to the free field
Overcome and more will always be revealed
Not alone, I'll be there, tell me when you wanna go

[Chorus]
(So)
(Sideways fallin', more will be revealed, my friend)
(Sideways fallin')
Don't forget me, I can't hide it
(More will be revealed, my friend)
Come again, make me excited

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh)
(Sideways fallin', more will be revealed, my friend)
(Sideways fallin')
Don't forget me, I can't hide it
(More will be revealed, my friend)
There's a match, now let me light it

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 7]
I'm the bloodstain on your shirt sleeve
Comin' down and more are comin' to believe
Now we know it all for sure

[Verse 8]
Make the hair stand up on your arm
Teach you how to dance inside the funny farm
Not alone, I'll be there, tell me when you wanna go

[Outro]
I'll be there but tell me when you wanna go
Come again and tell me when you wanna go
More will be revealed, my friend

[Intro]
Finally Famous in this..

[Verse 1]
It's crazy how they think you got it all figured out
Just because your bank account gets all figured out
Next time somebody try and tell you how to run your shit
And they ain't major shit
Do yourself a favor: kick 'em out
Eat good and do that, you'll live a long life
I always say long days is better than long nights
At least in the day you've got shade
In the night its all shadows, don't get caught at wrong lights
I wish somebody would have told B.I.G. that before March 9th
I used to think there's no such things as wrong rights
'Till my stepbrother brought home them extra groceries
Extra cheese, now mom could make her special recipe
But I didn't know it was off of infested streets
Now he the reason I've got to walk with my little niece to go eat
I guess that's the hunger that got me out
At the top of hotel suites renting the lobbies out, you know?
Stuntin' like a bitch, prom night me out
And the girl I've wanted since ninth grade trying to route
That was back
When
I was seventeen
It's crazy though, cause even then I thought I had
It all figured out

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]

[Verse 2]
It's crazy how much that you can see with your eyes closed
'Specially if you've got a vision
Or how you could have everything
And still think about everything missing
Like I probably remember the times that I missed out on
More than the ones I lived
I probably remember the girls that I ain't have
More than the ones I did
But I remain a two timing, one girl on the way
Two lying and one bed-never too tired
Smoke so much I need two lighters
Shoppin overseas I do buy it, who higher?
They taught me that I had to dream, black history month
I wake up and treat the day like stack history month
I'm talkin' Malcolm Flex, Jessie Rackson
Front of the plane: I'm Rozay Parks
SUV swervin like it's O.J.'s car, oh
To me and my dogs is all gettin out
Somewhere in the club probably all liquored out
Finna take extra shots for my dogs missin' out
That keep remindin' me at the same time
That I still ain't got it all figured out
Fact, the only thing I really figured out
Is that I'll never have it all figured out, fuck
Even when your bank account is all figured out
Even when your bank account gets all figured out
Even when your best friend gets all triggered out
Even when it.. all of it... when you still ain't got....

[Outro]
Today I woke up and realized every day gets shorter
Every minute turns to the longest second, yet never ending
Age is nothing but a reminder and it doesn't tell you
How old or young minded someone is
Cause we all start at the same starting point of a woman's legs
But each have our own finish line
Understand it never ends, and the only way to be immortalized
Is to be remembered, hopefully from right than wrong
Better to be in the hall of fame than shame
Whether it exists for what you do or not
We create this world so we make what exists
It isn't about the award, it's about the award of being immortalized
And remembered for all the right reasons
Mistakes are forgotten, no footprints of any missteps
So when it's so late that it's early
And you need a drink even though the bar's closed
Remember why you do what you do
For the coldest drinks, the fastest cars, luxury
The adrenaline rush of creating what you think about
With who thinks about you:
Your family, your team
The joy of looking back and saying that you did it
Winning the game: hall of fame

[Verse 1]
How many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money I'd do things my way
Hmm, but little they know
Hmm, it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind

[Verse 2]
Hmm, once I was wading in fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life’s game
But suddenly it happened
Hmm, I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind

[Verse 3]
Hmm, when my life is over and my time has run out
My friends and my love ones
I'll leave there's no doubt
But one thing for certain
When it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind

[Verse 1]
I was blinded by the devil
Born already ruined
Stone-cold dead
As I stepped out of the womb
By His grace I have been touched
By His word I have been healed
By His hand I’ve been delivered
By His spirit I’ve been sealed

[Chorus]
I’ve been saved
By the blood of the lamb
Saved
By the blood of the lamb
Saved
Saved
And I’m so glad
Yes, I’m so glad
I’m so glad
So glad
I want to thank You, Lord
I just want to thank You, Lord
Thank You, Lord

[Verse 2]
By His truth I can be upright
By His strength I do endure
By His power I’ve been lifted
In His love I am secure
He bought me with a price
Freed me from the pit
Full of emptiness and wrath
And the fire that burns in it

[Chorus]
I’ve been saved
By the blood of the lamb
Saved
By the blood of the lamb
Saved
Saved
And I’m so glad
Yes, I’m so glad
I’m so glad
So glad
I want to thank You, Lord
I just want to thank You, Lord
Thank You, Lord

[Verse 3]
Nobody to rescue me
Nobody would dare
I was going down for the last time
But by His mercy I’ve been spared
Not by works
But by faith in Him who called
For so long I’ve been hindered
For so long I’ve been stalled

[Chorus]
I’ve been saved
By the blood of the lamb
Saved
By the blood of the lamb
Saved
Saved
And I’m so glad
Yes, I’m so glad
I’m so glad
So glad
I want to thank You, Lord
I just want to thank You, Lord
Thank You, Lord

[Verse 1]
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
Way up yonder, great will be her reward
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star
I know I can trust you to stay where you are

[Chorus]
And I just got to tell you
I do intend
To stay closer than any friend
I just got to thank you
Once again
For making your prayers known
Unto heaven for me
And to you, always, so grateful
I will forever be

[Verse 2]
I’ve been broken, shattered like an empty cup
I’m just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up
And I know He will do it ’cause He’s faithful and He’s true
He must have loved me so much to send me someone as fine as you

[Chorus]
And I just got to tell you
I do intend
To stay closer than any friend
I just got to thank you
Once again
For making your prayers known
Unto heaven for me
And to you, always, so grateful
I will forever be

[Verse 3]
Covenant woman, intimate little girl
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world
You know we are strangers in a land we’re passing through
I’ll always be right by your side, I’ve got a covenant too

[Chorus]
And I just got to tell you
I do intend
To stay closer than any friend
I just got to thank you
Once again
For making your prayers known
Unto heaven for me
And to you, always, so grateful
I will forever be

[Chorus]
You have given everything to me
What can I do for You?
You have given me eyes to see
What can I do for You?

[Verse 1]
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside
Filled up a hunger that had always been denied
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide
And You’ve chosen me to be among the few
What can I do for You?

[Chorus]
You have laid down Your life for me
What can I do for You?
You have explained every mystery
What can I do for You?

[Verse 2]
Soon as a man is born, you know the sparks begin to fly
He gets wise in his own eyes and he’s made to believe a lie
Who would deliver him from the death he’s bound to die?
Well, You’ve done it all and there’s no more anyone can pretend to do
What can I do for You?

[Chorus]
You have given all there is to give
What can I do for You?
You have given me life to live
How can I live for You?

[Verse 3]
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts
I don’t care how rough the road is, show me where it starts
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart
Well, I don’t deserve it but I sure did make it through
What can I do for You?

[Chorus]
Well, I’m hanging on to a solid rock
Made before the foundation of the world
And I won’t let go, and I can’t let go, won’t let go
And I can’t let go, won’t let go and I can’t let go no more

[Verse 1]
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated
For me He was rejected by a world that He created
Nations are angry, cursed are some
People are expecting a false peace to come

[Chorus]
Well, I’m hanging on to a solid rock
Made before the foundation of the world
And I won’t let go, and I can’t let go, won’t let go
And I can’t let go, won’t let go and I can’t let go no more

[Verse 2]
It’s the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it
Using all the devices under the sun
And He never give up ’til the battle’s lost or won

[Chorus]
Well, I’m hanging on to a solid rock
Made before the foundation of the world
And I won’t let go, and I can’t let go, won’t let go
And I can’t let go, won’t let go and I can’t let go no more

[Chorus]
Well I’m pressing on
Yes, I’m pressing on
Well I’m pressing on
To the higher calling of my Lord

[Verse 1]
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind
Say, “Prove to me that He is Lord, show me a sign”
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within
When what’s lost has been found, what’s to come has already been?

[Chorus]
Well I’m pressing on
Yes, I’m pressing on
Well I’m pressing on
To the higher calling of my Lord

[Verse 2]
Shake the dust off of your feet, don’t look back
Nothing now can hold you down, nothing that you lack
Temptation’s not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
Because he sinned I got no choice, it run in my vein

[Chorus]
Well I’m pressing on
Yes, I’m pressing on
Well I’m pressing on
To the higher calling of my Lord

[Verse 1]
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Did they know He was the Son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Did they hear when He told Peter, “Peter, put up your sword”?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?

[Verse 2]
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Nicodemus came at night so he wouldn’t be seen by men
Saying, “Master, tell me why a man must be born again”
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?

[Verse 3]
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
When He said, “Pick up your bed and walk, why must you criticize?
Same thing My Father do, I can do likewise”
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?

[Verse 4]
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?

[Verse 5]
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
He said, “All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth”
Did they know right then and there what the power was worth?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?

[Verse 1]
If you find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Guess I owe You some kind of apology
I’ve escaped death so many times, I know I’m only living
By the saving grace that’s over me

[Verse 2]
By this time I’d-a thought I would be sleeping
In a pine box for all eternity
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
For the saving grace that’s over me

[Verse 3]
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection
Wherever I am welcome is where I’ll be
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Is the saving grace that’s over me

[Verse 4]
Well, the devil’s shining light, it can be most blinding
But to search for love, that ain’t no more than vanity
As I look around this world all that I’m finding
Is the saving grace that’s over me

[Verse 5]
The wicked know no peace and you just can’t fake it
There’s only one road and it leads to Calvary
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I’ll make it
By the saving grace that’s over me

[Verse 1]
Come an' gather 'round friends
And I'll tell ya a tale
Of when the red iron ore pits ran a-plenty
But the cardboard filled windows
And old men on the benches
Tell you now that the whole town is empty

[Verse 2]
In the north end of town
My own children are grown
Well I was raised on the other
In the wee hours of youth
My mother took sick
And I was brought up by my brother

[Verse 3]
The iron ore poured
As the years passed the door
The drag lines and the shovels they was a-hummin'
'Til one day my brother
Failed to come home
The same as my father before him

[Verse 4]
Well a long winter's wait
From the winda' I watched
My friends they couldn'ta been kinder
And my schooling was cut
As I quit in the spring
To marry John Thomas, a miner

[Verse 5]
Oh the years passed again
And the givin' was good
With the lunch bucket filled every season
What with three babies born
The work was cut down
To a half a day's shift with no reason

[Verse 6]
Then the shaft was soon shut
And more work was cut
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
'Til a man come to speak
And he said in one week
That number eleven was closin'

[Verse 7]
They complained in the East
They're payin' too high
They say that your ore ain't worth a-diggin'
That it's much cheaper down
In the South American towns
Where the miners work almost for nothin'

[Verse 8]
So the minin' gates locked
And the red iron rotted
And the room smelled heavy from drinkin'
When the sad silent song
Made the hour twice as long
As I waited for the sun to go sinking

[Verse 9]
I lived by the window
As he talked to himself
This silence of tongues it was buildin'
'Til one morning's wake
The bed it was bare
And I's left alone with three children

[Verse 10]
The summer is gone
The ground's turning cold
The stores one by one they're a-foldin'
My children will go
As soon they grow
For there ain't nothin' here now to hold them

[Verse 1]
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do
Nobody in the world can get along with you
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den
I come home last night you wouldn't even let me in

[Verse 2]
Oh sometimes you're as sweet as anybody want to be
Oh when you get the crazy notion of jumping all over me
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied
When you give me the blues I want to lay down and die

[Harmonica bridge: 0:35 - 0:58]

[Verse 3]
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama
I helped you when you had no food to eat
Now you're the kind of woman that just don't understand
You're taking all my money and give it to another man

[Verse 4]
Well, you're that kind of woman makes a man lose his brains
You're that kind of woman drives a man insane
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied
You give me the blues, I want to lay down and die

[Verse 1]
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die
Well, I don't mind dying
But I hate to leave my children crying
Well, I look over yonder to that burying ground
Look over yonder to that burying ground
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down

[Verse 2]
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die
Well, I don't mind dying but
I hate to leave my children crying
There's a black smoke rising, Lord
It's rising up above my head, up above my head
There's a black smoke rising, Lord
It's rising up above my head, up above my head
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed

[Verse 3]
I'm walking kind of funny, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die
Yes I'm walking kind of funny, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die
Fixing to die, fixing to die
Well, I don't mind dying
But I hate to leave my children crying

[Intro]
I first heard this from Ric von Schmidt
He lives in Cambridge
Ric's a blues guitar player
I met him one day in the
Green pastures of Harvard University

[Chorus]
Baby, let me follow you down
Baby, let me follow you down
Well, I'll do anything in this God-almighty world
If you just let me follow you down

[Verse 1]
Can I come home with you?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-almighty world
If you just let me come home with you

[Chorus]
Baby, let me follow you down
Baby, let me follow you down
Well, I'll do anything in this God-almighty world
If you just let me follow you down

[Outro]
Yes, I'd do anything in this God-almighty world
If you just let me follow you down

[Additional Verses (1966 live version)]
I'll buy you a diamond ring
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown
Yes, I'll do anything in this god almighty world
If you just let me follow you down

I'll buy you rope and twine
Honey, just for you to climb
Yes, I'll do anything in this god almighty world
If you just once drive me out of my mind

Buy you a hoop and skirt
I'll buy you a velvet shirt
Yes, I'll do anything in this god almighty world
If you just don't make me hurt

[Chorus]
Well there's one kind of favor I'll ask for you
Well there's one kind of favor I'll ask for you
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask for you
You can see that my grave is kept clean

[Verse 1]
And there's two white horses following me
And there's two white horses following me
I got two white horses following me
Waiting on my burying ground

[Verse 2]
Did you ever hear that coffin sound
Did you ever hear that coffin sound
Did you ever hear that coffin sound
Means another poor boy is under the ground

[Verse 3]
Did you ever hear them church bells toll
Did you ever hear them church bells toll
Did you ever hear them church bells toll
Means another poor boy is dead and gone

[Verse 4]
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And I believe what the Bible told

[Chorus]
And there's one last favor I'll ask for you
And there's one last favor I'll ask for you
And just one last flavor I'll ask for you
You can see that my grave is kept clean

[Chorus]
I need a shot of love
I need a shot of love

[Verse 1]
Don’t need a shot of heroin to kill my disease
Don’t need a shot of turpentine, only bring me to my knees
Don’t need a shot of codeine to help me to repent
Don’t need a shot of whiskey, help me be president

[Chorus]
I need a shot of love
I need a shot of love

[Verse 2]
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it’s making me feel afraid
What I got ain’t painful, it’s just bound to kill me dead
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head

[Chorus]
I need a shot of love
I need a shot of love

[Verse 3]
I don’t need no alibi when I’m spending time with you
I’ve heard all of them rumors and you have heard them too
Don’t show me no picture show or give me no book to read
It don’t satisfy the hurt inside nor the habit that it feeds

[Chorus]
I need a shot of love
I need a shot of love

[Verse 4]
Why would I want to take your life?
You’ve only murdered my father, raped his wife
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends

[Chorus]
I need a shot of love
I need a shot of love

[Verse 5]
Don’t want to be with nobody tonight
Veronica not around nowhere, Mavis just ain’t right
There’s a man that hates me and he’s swift, smooth and near
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he’s here?

[Chorus]
I need a shot of love
I need a shot of love

[Verse 6]
What makes the wind want to blow tonight?
Don’t even feel like crossing the street and my car ain’t actin’ right
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away
My conscience is beginning to bother me today

[Chorus]
I need a shot of love
I need a shot of love

[Outro]
I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love
If you’re a doctor, I need a shot of love

[Verse 1]
Heart of mine be still
You can play with fire but you’ll get the bill
Don’t let her know
Don’t let her know that you love her
Don’t be a fool, don’t be blind
Heart of mine

[Verse 2]
Heart of mine go back home
You got no reason to wander, you got no reason to roam
Don’t let her see
Don’t let her see that you need her
Don’t put yourself over the line
Heart of mine

[Verse 3]
Heart of mine go back where you been
It’ll only be trouble for you if you let her in
Don’t let her hear
Don’t let her hear you want her
Don’t let her think you think she’s fine
Heart of mine

[Verse 4]
Heart of mine you know that she’ll never be true
She’ll only give to others the love that she’s gotten from you
Don’t let her know
Don’t let her know where you’re going
Don’t untie the ties that bind
Heart of mine

[Verse 5]
Heart of mine so malicious and so full of guile
Give you an inch and you’ll take a mile
Don’t let yourself fall
Don’t let yourself stumble
If you can’t do the time, don’t do the crime
Heart of mine

[Verse 1]
Go ahead and talk about him because he makes you doubt
Because he has denied himself the things that you can’t live without
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through

[Chorus]
He’s the property of Jesus
Resent him to the bone
You got something better
You’ve got a heart of stone

[Verse 2]
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street
Hope he falls upon himself, oh, won’t that be sweet
Because he can’t be exploited by superstition anymore
Because he can’t be bribed or bought by the things that you adore

[Chorus]
He’s the property of Jesus
Resent him to the bone
You got something better
You’ve got a heart of stone

[Verse 3]
When the whip that’s keeping you in line doesn’t make him jump
Say he’s hard-of-hearing, say that he’s a chump
Say he’s out of step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Because he doesn’t pay no tribute to the king that you serve

[Chorus]
He’s the property of Jesus
Resent him to the bone
You got something better
You’ve got a heart of stone

[Verse 4]
Say that he’s a loser ’cause he got no common sense
Because he don’t increase his worth at someone else’s expense
Because he’s not afraid of trying, ’cause he don’t look at you and smile
’Cause he doesn’t tell you jokes or fairy tales, say he’s got no style

[Chorus]
He’s the property of Jesus
Resent him to the bone
You got something better
You’ve got a heart of stone

[Verse 5]
You can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games
You think that when you rest at last you’ll go back from where you came
But you’ve picked up quite a story and you’ve changed since the womb
What happened to the real you, you’ve been captured but by whom?

[Chorus]
He’s the property of Jesus
Resent him to the bone
You got something better
You’ve got a heart of stone

[Verse 1]
Love that’s pure hopes all things
Believes all things, won’t pull no strings
Won’t sneak up into your room, tall, dark and handsome
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom

[Chorus]
You don’t want a love that’s pure
You want to drown love
You want a watered-down love

[Verse 2]
Love that’s pure, it don’t make no false claims
Intercedes for you ’stead of casting you blame
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression
Won’t write it up and make you sign a false confession

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Love that’s pure won’t lead you astray
Won’t hold you back, won’t mess up your day
Won’t pervert you, corrupt you with stupid wishes
It don’t make you envious, it don’t make you suspicious

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Love that’s pure ain’t no accident
Always on time, is always content
An eternal flame, quietly burning
Never needs to be proud, restlessly yearning

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild goose chase

[Chorus]
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the turning of the page
Curtain rising on a new age
See the groom still waiting at the altar

[Verse 2]
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
About the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be

[Chorus]
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the turning of the page
Curtain rising on a new age
See the groom still waiting at the altar

[Verse 3]
Don't know what I can say about Claudette that wouldn't come back to haunt me
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she began to want me
But I know God has mercy on them who are slandered and humiliated
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she’d only made me feel obligated

[Chorus]
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the turning of the page
Curtain rising on a new age
See the groom still waiting at the altar

[Verse 4]
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
I see people who are supposed to know better standing around like furniture
There's a wall between you and what you want and you got to leap it
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to
Keep it

[Chorus]
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the turning of the page
Curtain rising on a new age
See the groom still waiting at the altar

[Verse 5]
Cities on fire, phones out of order
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border
What can I say about Claudette?
Ain't seen her since January
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires

[Chorus]
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the turning of the page
Curtain rising on a new age
See the groom still waiting at the altar

[Verse 1]
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine
Never being able to separate the good from the bad
Ooh, I can’t stand it, I can’t stand it
It’s making me feel so sad

[Chorus]
Dead man, dead man
When will you arise?
Cobwebs in your mind
Dust upon your eyes

[Verse 2]
Satan got you by the heel, there’s a bird’s nest in your hair
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move
Ooh, I can’t stand it, I can’t stand it
What are you trying to prove?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you end up in
The race of the engine that overrules your heart
Ooh, I can’t stand it, I can’t stand it
Pretending that you’re so smart

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
What are you trying to overpower me with, the doctrine or the gun?
My back is already to the wall, where can I run?
The tuxedo that you’re wearing, the flower in your lapel
Ooh, I can’t stand it, I can’t stand it
You want to take me down to hell

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I was in your presence for an hour or so
Or was it a day? I truly don't know
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low
By that soft and shining sea
Did you respect me for what I did
Or for what I didn't do, or for keeping it hid?
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
Of everything you see?

[Chorus]
In the summertime, ah in the summertime
In the summertime, when you were with me

[Verse 2]
I got the heart and you got the blood
We cut through iron and we cut through mud
Then came the warning that was before the flood
That set everybody free
Fools they made a mock of sin
Our loyalty they tried to win
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
When they didn't want to know or see

[Chorus]
In the summertime, ah in the summertime
In the summertime, when you were with me

[Verse 3]
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs
Poverty and shame was theirs
But all that suffering was not to be compared
With the glory that is to be
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave
It's a part of me now, it’s been cherished and saved
It'll be with me unto the grave
And then unto eternity

[Chorus]
In the summertime, ah in the summertime
In the summertime, when you were with me

[Verse 1]
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm
You got your rabbit’s foot, you got your good-luck charm
But they can’t help you none when there’s trouble

[Chorus]
Trouble
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Nothing but trouble

[Verse 2]
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you’ll find trouble there
Revolution even ain’t no solution for trouble

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul
Persecution, execution, governments out of control
You can see the writing on the wall inviting trouble

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground
You ever feel like you’re never alone even when there’s nobody else around?
Since the beginning of the universe man’s been cursed by trouble

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Standing on the waters casting your bread
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing
Distant ships sailing into the mist
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing
Freedom just around the corner for you
But with the truth so far off, what good will it do?

[Chorus]
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman

[Verse 2]
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky
You rise up and say goodbye to no one
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
Both of their futures, so full of dread, you don't show one
Shedding off one more layer of skin
Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within

[Chorus]
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman

[Verse 3]
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream twister
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name

[Chorus]
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman

[Verse 4]
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers
In the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space
Half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face

[Chorus]
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman

[Verse 5]
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame
Preacherman seeks the same, who'll get there first is uncertain
Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in

[Chorus]
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman

[Verse 6]
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery grey
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat
Take the motherless children off the street
And place them at the feet of a harlot
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response

[Chorus]
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman

[Verse 1]
Well, the pressure’s down, the boss ain't here
He gone North, for a while
They say that vanity got the best of him
But he sure left here in style
By the way, that’s a cute hat
And that smile’s so hard to resist
But what’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?

[Verse 2]
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you
She wanted a whole man, not just a half
She used to call me sweet daddy when I was only a child
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear
It’s done with a flick of the wrist
What’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?

[Verse 3]
You know, a woman like you should be at home
That’s where you belong
Watching out for someone who loves you true
Who would never do you wrong
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Well, there’s no way to tell by that first kiss
What’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?

[Verse 4]
You know you can make a name for yourself
You can hear them tires squeal
You can be known as the most beautiful woman
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal

[Verse 5]
You know, news of you has come down the line
Even before you came in the door
They say in your father’s house, there’s many mansions
Each one of them got a fireproof floor
Snap out of it, baby, people are jealous of you
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss
What’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?

[Verse 6]
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey
Got to have done some evil deed
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed

[Verse 7]
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
To which a scoundrel clings
Steal a little and they throw you in jail
Steal a lot and they make you king
There’s only one step down from here, baby
It’s called the land of permanent bliss
What’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?

[Verse 1]
Well, the neighborhood bully, he’s just one man
His enemies say he’s on their land
They got him outnumbered about a million to one
He got no place to escape to, no place to run
He’s the neighborhood bully

[Verse 2]
The neighborhood bully just lives to survive
He’s criticized and condemned for being alive
He’s not supposed to fight back, he’s supposed to have thick skin
He’s supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in
He’s the neighborhood bully

[Verse 3]
The neighborhood bully been driven out of every land
He’s wandered the earth an exiled man
Seen his family scattered, his people hounded and torn
He’s always on trial for just being born
He’s the neighborhood bully

[Verse 4]
Well, he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, nobody was glad
The bombs were meant for him. He was supposed to feel bad
He’s the neighborhood bully

[Verse 5]
Well, the chances are against it and the odds are slim
That he’ll live by the rules that the world makes for him
Because there’s a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
And a license to kill him is given out to every maniac
He’s the neighborhood bully

[Verse 6]
He got no allies to really speak of
What he gets he must pay for, he don’t get it out of love
He buys obsolete weapons and he won’t be denied
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side
He’s the neighborhood bully

[Verse 7]
Well, he’s surrounded by pacifists who all want peace
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed must cease
Now, they wouldn’t hurt a fly. To hurt one they would weep
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep
He’s the neighborhood bully

[Verse 8]
Every empire that’s enslaved him is gone
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon
He’s made a garden of paradise in the desert sand
In bed with nobody, under no one’s command
He’s the neighborhood bully

[Verse 9]
Now his holiest books have been trampled upon
No contract he signed was worth what it was written on
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health
He’s the neighborhood bully

[Verse 10]
What’s anybody indebted to him for?
Nothing, they say. He just likes to cause war
Pride and prejudice and superstition indeed
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed
He’s the neighborhood bully

[Verse 11]
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Does he change the course of rivers? Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Neighborhood bully, standing on the hill
Running out the clock, time standing still
Neighborhood bully

[Verse 1]
Man thinks because he rules the earth he can do with it as he please
And if things don’t change soon, he will
Oh, man has invented his doom
First step was touching the moon

[Refrain]
Now, there’s a woman on my block
She just sit there as the night grows still
She say who going to take away his license to kill?

[Verse 2]
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
And they set him on a path where he’s bound to get ill
Then they bury him with stars
Sell his body like they do used cars

[Refrain]
Now, there’s a woman on my block
She just sits there facing the hill
She say who going to take away his license to kill?

[Verse 3]
Now, he’s hell-bent for destruction, he’s afraid and confused
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill
All he believes are his eyes
And his eyes, they just tell him lies

[Refrain]
But there’s a woman on my block
Sitting there in a cold chill
She say who going to take away his license to kill?

[Verse 4]
You may be a noisemaker, spirit maker
Heartbreaker, backbreaker
Leave no stone unturned
May be an actor in a plot
That might be all that you got
Till your error you clearly learn

[Verse 5]
Now he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And when he sees his reflection, he’s fulfilled
Oh, man is opposed to fair play
He wants it all and he wants it his way

[Refrain]
Now, there’s a woman on my block
She just sit there as the night grows still
She say who going to take away his license to kill?

[Verse 1]
Look out your window, baby, there’s a scene you’d like to catch
The band is playing “Dixie,” a man got his hand outstretched
Could be the Führer
Could be the local priest
You know sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

[Verse 2]
He got a sweet gift of gab, he got a harmonious tongue
He knows every song of love that ever has been sung
Good intentions can be evil
Both hands can be full of grease
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

[Verse 3]
Well, first he’s in the background, then he’s in the front
Both eyes are looking like they’re on a rabbit hunt
Nobody can see through him
No, not even the Chief of Police
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

[Verse 4]
Well, he catch you when you’re hoping for a glimpse of the sun
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton
He could be standing next to you
The person that you’d notice least
I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

[Verse 5]
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull
I can smell something cooking
I can tell there’s going to be a feast
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

[Verse 6]
He’s a great humanitarian, he’s a great philanthropist
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed
He’ll put both his arms around you
You can feel the tender touch of the beast
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

[Verse 7]
Well, the howling wolf will howl tonight, the king snake will crawl
Trees that’ve stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall
Want to get married? Do it now
Tomorrow all activity will cease
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

[Verse 8]
Somewhere Mama’s weeping for her blue-eyed boy
She’s holding them little white shoes and that little broken toy
And he’s following a star
The same one them three men followed from the East
I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

[Verse 1]
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore
My flashlight’s from Taiwan
My tablecloth’s from Malaysia
My belt buckle’s from the Amazon
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet
It was put together down in Argentina
By a guy making thirty cents a day

[Chorus]
Well, it’s sundown on the union
And what’s made in the U.S.A
Sure was a good idea
'Til greed got in the way

[Verse 2]
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
And the pearls are from Japan
Well, the dog collar’s from India
And the flower pot’s from Pakistan
All the furniture, it says “Made in Brazil”
Where a woman, she slaved for sure
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve
You know, that’s a lot of money to her

[Chorus]
Well, it’s sundown on the union
And what’s made in the U.S.A
Sure was a good idea
'Til greed got in the way

[Verse 3]
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work
I say, “Why you say that for
When nothing you got is U. S. made?”
They don’t make nothin’ here no more
You know, capitalism is above the law
It say, “It don’t count ’less it sells”
When it costs too much to build it at home
You just build it cheaper someplace else

[Chorus]
Well, it’s sundown on the union
And what’s made in the U.S.A
Sure was a good idea
'Til greed got in the way

[Verse 4]
Well, the job that you used to have
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador
The unions are big business, friend
And they’re going out like a dinosaur
They used to grow food in Kansas
Now they want to grow it on the moon and eat it raw
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Is going to be against the law

[Chorus]
Well, it’s sundown on the union
And what’s made in the U.S.A
Sure was a good idea
'Til greed got in the way

[Verse 5]
Democracy don’t rule the world
You’d better get that in your head
This world is ruled by violence
But I guess that’s better left unsaid
From Broadway to the Milky Way
That’s a lot of territory indeed
And a man’s going to do what he has to do
When he’s got a hungry mouth to feed

[Chorus]
Well, it’s sundown on the union
And what’s made in the U.S.A
Sure was a good idea
'Til greed got in the way

[Verse 1]
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams
In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams

[Chorus]
I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

[Verse 2]
Think I’ll go out and go for a walk
Not much happening here, nothing ever does
Besides, if she wakes up now, she’ll just want me to talk
I got nothing to say, specially about whatever was

[Chorus]
I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

[Verse 3]
Took an untrodden path once, where the swift don’t win the race
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth
Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice’s beautiful face
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth

[Chorus]
I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

[Verse 4]
Outside of two men on a train platform there’s nobody in sight
They’re waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track
The world could come to an end tonight, but that’s all right
She should still be there sleepin’ when I get back

[Chorus]
I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

[Verse 5]
Noontime, and I’m still pushing myself along the road, the darkest part
Into the narrow lanes, I can’t stumble or stay put
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I’m listening only to my heart
I’ve made shoes for everyone, even you, while I still go barefoot

[Chorus]
I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door
What is it that you’re trying to achieve, girl?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
Who’ve lost all ray of hope
You know, it's not even safe no more
In the palace of the Pope

[Chorus]
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
I just don’t think that I could handle it
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday’s just a memory
Tomorrow is never what it’s supposed to be
And I need you, yeah

[Verse 2]
Come over here from over there, girl
Sit down here, you can have my chair
I can’t see us goin' anywhere, girl
The only place open is a thousand miles away
And I can’t take you there
I wished I’d have been a doctor
Maybe I’d have saved some life that've been lost
Maybe I’d have done some good in the world
Instead of burning every bridge I crossed

[Chorus]
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
I just don’t think that I could handle it
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday’s just a memory
Tomorrow's never what it’s supposed to be
And I need you, ah, yeah

[Verse 3]
I ain't too good at conversation, girl
So you might not know exactly how I feel
But if I could I’d bring you to the mountain top, girl
And build you a house made out of stainless steel
But it’s like I’m stuck inside a painting
That’s a-hanging in the Louvre
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches
But I know that I can’t move

[Chorus]
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
I just don’t think that I could handle it
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday’s gone but the past live' on
Tomorrow's just one step beyond
And I need you, ah

[Bridge]
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
With their humorless smiles so easy to see through
Can they tell you what’s wrong from what’s right?
Oh, do you remember St. James Street
Where you blew Jackie P.’s mind?
You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
And laid his life on the line

[Verse 4]
Let’s try to get beneath the surface waste, girl
No more booby traps and bombs
No more decadence and charms
No more affection that’s misplaced, girl
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms
What about that millionaire
With the drumsticks in his pants?
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
When he played and we didn’t dance

[Chorus]
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
I just don’t think that I could handle it
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday is just a memory
Tomorrow's never what it’s supposed to be
And I need you
Yeah, you, ah
I need you

[Verse 1]
Well, I had to move fast
And I couldn’t with you around my neck
I said I’d send for you and I did
What did you expect?
My hands are sweating
And we haven’t even started yet
I’ll go along with the charade
Until I can think my way out
I know it was all a big joke
Whatever it was about
Someday maybe
I’ll remember to forget

[Verse 2]
I’m going to get my coat
I feel the breath of a storm
There’s something I’ve got to do tonight
You go inside and stay warm

[Chorus]
Has anybody seen my love?
Has anybody seen my love?
Has anybody seen my love?
I don’t know
Has anybody seen my love?

[Verse 3]
You want to talk to me
Go ahead and talk
Whatever you got to say to me
Won’t come as any shock
I must be guilty of something
You just whisper it into my ear
Madame Butterfly
She lulled me to sleep
In a town without pity
Where the water runs deep
She said, “Be easy, baby
There is nothing worth stealing in here”

[Verse  4]
You’re the one I’ve been looking for
You’re the one that’s got the key
But I can’t figure out whether I’m too good for you
Or you’re too good for me

[Chorus]
Has anybody seen my love?
Has anybody seen my love?
Has anybody seen my love?
I don’t know
Has anybody seen my love?

[Verse 5]
Well, they’re not showing any lights tonight
And there’s no moon
There’s just a hot-blooded singer
Singing “Memphis in June”
While they’re beating the devil out of a guy
Who’s wearing a powder-blue wig
Later he’ll be shot
For resisting arrest
I can still hear his voice crying
In the wilderness
What looks large from a distance
Close up is never that big

[Outro]
Never could learn to drink that blood
And call it wine
Never could learn to hold you, love
And call you mine

[Verse 1]
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down
But it looks like it don’t
I’d like to get you to change your mind
But it looks like you won’t

[Verse 2]
From now on I’ll be busy
I am not going to nowhere fast
I’m just glad it’s over
And I’m seeing the real you at last

[Verse 3]
Well, didn’t I risk my neck for you
Didn’t I take chances?
Didn’t I rise above it all for you
The most unfortunate circumstances?

[Verse 4]
Well, I have had some rotten nights
Didn’t think that they would pass
I’m just thankful and grateful
To be seeing the real you at last

[Verse 5]
I’m hungry and I’m irritable
And I’m tired of this bag of tricks
At one time there was nothing wrong with me
That you could not fix

[Verse 6]
Well, I sailed through the storm
Strapped to the mast
But the time has come
And I’m seeing the real you at last

[Verse 7]
When I met you, baby
You didn’t show no visible scars
You could ride like Annie Oakley
You could shoot like Belle Starr

[Verse 8]
Well, I don’t mind a reasonable amount of trouble
Trouble always comes to pass
But all I care about now
Is that I’m seeing the real you at last

[Verse 9]
Well, I’m going to quit this baby talk now
I guess I should have known
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles
I think maybe we’d better leave each other alone

[Verse 10]
Whatever you going to do
Please do it fast
I’m still trying to get used to
Seeing the real you at last

[Verse 1]
I'll remember you
When I've forgotten all the rest
You to me were true
You to me were the best
When there is no more
You cut to the core
Quicker than anyone I knew
When I'm all alone
In the great unknown
I'll remember you

[Verse 2]
I'll remember you
At the end of the trail
I had so much left to do
I had so little time to fail
There's some people that
You don't forget
Even though you've only seen 'em one time or two
When the roses fade
And I'm in the shade
I'll remember you

[Bridge]
Didn't I, didn't I try to love you?
Didn't I, didn't I try to care?
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
With the rain blowing in your hair?

[Verse 3]
I'll remember you
When the wind blows through the piney wood
It was you who came right through
It was you who understood
Though I'd never say
That I done it the way
That you'd have liked me to
In the end
My dear sweet friend
I'll remember you

[Verse 1]
Everybody wants to know why he couldn’t adjust
Adjust to what, a dream that bust?

[Chorus]
He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did

[Verse 2]
They said what’s up is down, they said what isn’t is
They put ideas in his head he thought were his

[Chorus]
He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did

[Verse 3]
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band
When he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand

[Chorus]
He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did

[Verse 4]
He went to church on Sunday, he was a Boy Scout
For his friends he would turn his pockets inside out

[Chorus]
He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did

[Verse 5]
They said, “Listen boy, you’re just a pup”
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up

They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills
A jeep to drive, blood to spill

They said “Congratulations, you got what it takes”
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes

[Chorus]
He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did

[Verse 6]
He bought the American dream but it put him in debt
The only game he could play was Russian roulette

He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread
Ate Burger Kings, he was well fed

He went to Hollywood to see Peter O’Toole
He stole a Rolls-Royce and drove it in a swimming pool

[Chorus]
He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did

[Verse 7]
He could’ve sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar
Could’ve been an accountant or a tennis star

He was wearing boxing gloves, took a dive one day
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay

His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans
They got to sleep together in a home they don’t own

[Chorus]
He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did

[Verse 8]
Well, everybody’s asking why he couldn’t adjust
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust

They took his head and turned it inside out
He never did know what it was all about

He had a steady job, he joined the choir
He never did plan to walk the high wire

[Chorus]
He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did

[Verse 1]
Now you’re here beside me, baby
You’re a living dream
And every time you get this close
It makes me want to scream
You touched me and you knew
That I was warm for you and then
I am never going to be the same again

[Verse 2]
Sorry if I hurt you, baby
Sorry if I did
Sorry if I touched the place
Where your secrets are hid
But you meant more than everything
And I could not pretend
I am never going to be the same again

[Verse 3]
You give me something to think about, baby
Every time I see you
Don’t worry, baby, I don’t mind leaving
I’d just like it to be my idea

[Verse 4]
You taught me how to love you, baby
You taught me, oh, so well
Now, I can’t go back to what was, baby
I can’t unring the bell
You took my reality
And cast it to the wind
And I am not going to be the same again

[Verse 1]
Come baby, find me, come baby, remind me of where I once begun
Come baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you’re the one
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors
But I will always be emotionally yours

[Verse 2]
Come baby, rock me, come baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart
Come baby, teach me, come baby, reach me, let the music start
I could be dreaming but I keep believing you’re the one I’m living for
And I will always be emotionally yours

[Verse 3]
It’s like my whole life never happened
When I see you, it’s as if I never had a thought
I know this dream, it might be crazy
But it’s the only one I’ve got

[Verse 4]
Come baby, shake me, come baby, take me, I would be satisfied
Come baby, hold me, come baby, help me, my arms are open wide
I could be unraveling wherever I’m traveling, even to foreign shores
But I will always be emotionally yours

[Verse 1]
Look out across the fields, see me returning
Smoke is in your eye, you draw a smile
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning
You’ve had time to think about it for a while

[Verse 2]
Well, I’ve walked two hundred miles, now look me over
It’s the end of the chase and the moon is high
It won’t matter who loves who
You’ll love me or I’ll love you
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling from the sky

[Verse 3]
I can see through your walls and I know you’re hurting
Sorrow covers you up like a cape
Only yesterday I know that you’ve been flirting
With disaster you somehow managed to escape

[Verse 4]
Well, I can’t provide for you no easy answers
Who are you that I should have to lie?
You’ll know all about it, love
It’ll fit you like a glove
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling from the sky

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
You must have been protecting someone last time I called
I’ve never asked you for nothing that you couldn’t deliver
I’ve never asked you to set yourself up for a fall

[Verse 6]
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness
For the love of a lousy buck, I’ve watched them die
Stick around, baby, we’re not through
Don’t look for me, I’ll see you
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling from the sky

[Verse 7]
In your teardrops, I can see my own reflection
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line
I don’t want to be a fool starving for affection
I don’t want to drown in someone else’s wine

[Verse 8]
For all eternity I think I will remember
That icy wind that’s howling in your eye
You will seek me and you’ll find me
In the wasteland of your mind
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling from the sky

[Verse 9]
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter
But you were gambling for support
This time tomorrow I’ll know you better
When my memory is not so short

[Verse 10]
This time I’m asking for freedom
Freedom from a world which you deny
And you’ll give it to me now
I’ll take it anyhow
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling from the sky

[Verse 1]
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Something is the matter, baby, there’s smoke in your hair
Are you still my friend, baby, show me a sign
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?

[Verse 2]
You’ve been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while
The truth that I’m seeking is in your missing file
What’s your position, baby, what’s going on?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?

[Verse 3]
I know everything about this place, or so it seems
Am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed
What’s happening, baby, to make you act so strange?

[Verse 4]
Something is burning, baby, here’s what I say
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn’t find you today
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue
Who is he, baby, and what’s he to you?

[Verse 5]
We’ve reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?

[Verse 6]
I can feel it in the night when I think of you
I can feel it in the light and it’s got to be true
You can’t live by bread alone, you won’t be satisfied
You can’t roll away the stone if your hands are tied

[Verse 7]
Got to start someplace, baby, can you explain?
Please don’t fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train
Answer me, baby, a casual look will do
Just what in the world has come over you?

[Verse 8]
I can feel it in the wind and it’s upside down
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town
I’ve had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve
I don’t want to see you bleed, I know what you need but it is not what you deserve

[Verse 9]
Something is burning, baby, something’s in flames
There’s a man going around calling names
Ring down when you’re ready, baby, I’m waiting for you
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do

[Verse 1]
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
And the midnight moon is on the riverside
They’re drinking up and walking
And it is time for me to slide
I live in another world
Where life and death are memorized
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
And all I see are dark eyes

[Verse 2]
A cock is crowing far away
And another soldier’s deep in prayer
Some mother’s child has gone astray
She can’t find him anywhere
But I can hear another drum
Beating for the dead that rise
Whom nature’s beast fears as they come
And all I see are dark eyes

[Verse 3]
They tell me to be discreet
For all intended purposes
They tell me revenge is sweet
And from where they stand, I’m sure it is
But I feel nothing for their game
Where beauty goes unrecognized
All I feel is heat and flame
And all I see are dark eyes

[Verse 4]
Oh, the French girl, she’s in paradise
And a drunken man is at the wheel
Hunger pays a heavy price
To the falling gods of speed and steel
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
And passion rules the arrow that flies
A million faces at my feet
But all I see are dark eyes

[Intro: Buju Banton]
Have ah piece of body wey every good gyal deserve
But I won't allow this girl to mess with my nerves
Blessed figure, not to mention the curves
Through the corner of her eyes she slowly observe (Sing out)

[Verse 1: John Legend]
Any time she come around
Something is about to go down (Go down)
Listen to the siren sound
Wake up, wake up right now
'Cause if I was to go to sleep
Might catch me dreaming of a way to creep
Trouble always seems to follow me
Oh, don't follow me now

[Pre-Chorus]
(Over and over and over again)
I tried to tell her no, no, no, I already have a friend
(Over and over she's reeling me in)
She said nobody has to know, but I've got to let her go

[Chorus]
So I had to walk on by (She can't be my lover)
She's flashing me them pretty brown eyes (She can't be my lover)
Though there's green grass on the other side (She can't be my lover)
All I can say is hi (She can't be my lover), listen, listen right now

[Verse 2: John Legend]
Any time she hear the beat
She be dancing right in front of me
Trying to lure me in-between the sheets
But I'm a man and I still get weak
But I'll be damned if I lose my girl (Girl)
But I'll be damned if I don't touch her (Touch her)
Curiosity, it killed the cat
Oh, and I don't want that, so

[Pre-Chorus]
(Over and over and over again)
Tried to tell her no, no, no, I already have a friend
(Over and over she's reeling me in)
She said nobody has to know, but I've got to let her go

[Chorus]
So I had to walk on by (She can't be my lover)
Flashing me them pretty brown eyes (She can't be my lover)
Though there's green grass on the other side (She can't be my lover)
All I can say is hi (She can't be my lover), listen, listen right now

[Verse 3: Buju Banton]
I couldn't let you pass even if I try
Have a bird in the hand, why chase one in the sky?
Sexy female refuse to comply
Plus she is an empress who want ah stand-by
Been receiving love but she can't satisfy
Would like to have my cake and even enjoy the pie
Politely decline like me shy
Honey say me soft, come on, give it a try
Look in ah me eyes with seductive eyes
Filled with deception, trouble and lies
And I don't want no more problems in-a me life
Asked me fi me number so that we could enjoy the night, she wanna come over

[Pre-Chorus]
(Over and over and over again)
Tried to tell her no, no, no, I already have a friend
(Over and over she's reeling me in)
Oh, nobody has to know, but I've got to let her go

[Chorus]
So I had to walk on by (She can't be my lover)
Flashing me them pretty brown eyes (She can't be my lover)
Though there's green grass on the other side (She can't be my lover)
All I can say is hi (She can't be my lover), listen, listen right now

[Outro]
Listen, listen right now
Listen, listen right now
Listen, listen right now
Listen, listen right now

[Verse 1]
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi
He would not bow down he would not fight
He knew the deal was down and dirty
And nothing wrong could make it right away
But he knew his duty and the prize he had to pay
Just another holy man who tried to be a friend
My God, they killed him

[Verse 2]
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia
By name of Martin Luther King
He shook the land like the rolling thunder
And made the bells of freedom ring today
With a dream of beauty that they could not burn away
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand
My God, they killed him

[Verse 3]
The only Son of God Almighty
The holy one called Jesus Christ
He healed the lame and fed the hungry
And for his love they took his life away
On the road to glory where the story never ends
Just the holy Son of Man we'll never understand
My God, they killed him

[Verse 4]
There was a man named Mahatma Gandi
A man named Martin Luther King
The only Son of God Almighty
The only one called Jesus Christ
On the road to glory where the story never ends
Just the holy Son of Man we'll never understand
My God, they killed him

[Verse 5]
There was a man named Mahatma Gandi
A man named Martin Luther King
The only Son of God Almighty
The only one called Jesus Christ
On the road to glory where the story never ends
Just the holy Son of Man we'll never understand
My God, they killed him

[Verse 1]
I didn’t know that you’d be leaving’
Or who you thought you were talking’ to
I figure maybe we’re even
Or maybe I’m one up on you

[Verse 2]
I send you all my money
Just like I did before
I tried to reach you honey
But you’re drifting too far from shore

[Chorus]
Drifting too far from shore
Drifting too far from shore
Drifting too far from shore
Drifting too far from shore

[Verse 3]
I ain’t gonna get lost in this current
I don’t like playing cat and mouse
No gentleman likes making love to a servant
Especially when he’s in his father’s house

[Verse 4]
I never could guess your weight, baby
Never needed to call you my whore
I always thought you were straight, baby
But you’re drifting too far from shore

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Well these times and these tunnels are haunted
The bottom of the barrel is too
I waited years sometimes for what I wanted
Everybody can’t be as lucky as you

[Verse 6]
Never no more do I wonder
Why you don’t never play with me anymore
At any moment you could go under
’Cause you’re drifting too far from shore

[Chorus]

[Verse 7]
You and me we had completeness
I give you all of what I could provide
We weren’t on the wrong side, sweetness
We were the wrong side

[Verse 8]
I’ve already ripped out the phones, honey
You can’t walk the streets in a war
I can finish this alone honey
You’re drifting too far from shore

[Verse 1]
As I travel down life's pathway
Know not what the years may hold
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder
Precious memories flood my soul

[Chorus]
Precious memories, how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold

[Verse 2]
Precious father, loving mother
Glide across the lonely years
And old homes scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appears

[Chorus]
Precious memories, how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold

[Verse 1]
Maybe someday you’ll be satisfied
When you’ve lost everything you’ll have nothing left to hide
When you’re through running over things like you’re walking ’across the tracks
Maybe you’ll beg me to take you back
Maybe someday you’ll find out everybody’s somebody’s fool
Maybe then you’ll realize what it would have taken to keep me cool
Maybe someday when you’re by yourself alone
You’ll know the love that I had for you have been never my own

[Verse 2]
Maybe someday you’ll have nowhere to turn
You’ll look back and wonder ’bout the bridges you have burned
You’ll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
And you’ll see you look much better with me than you do with him
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down
Maybe someday, you will understand
That something for nothing is everybody’s plan

[Verse 3]
Maybe someday you’ll remember what you felt
When there was blood on the moon in the cotton belt
When both of us, baby, we're going through some sort of a test
Neither one of us could do what we do best
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough
Maybe someday, you’ll believe me when I say
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way

[Verse 4]
Maybe someday you’ll hear a voice from on high
Saying’, “For whose sake did you live, for whose sake did you die?”
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn’t do
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you
Always was a sucker for the right cross
Never wanted to go home ’till the last cent was lost
Maybe someday you will look back and see
That I made it so easy for you to follow me

[Verse 5]
Maybe someday there’ll be nothing to tell
I’m just as happy as you, baby, I just can’t say it so well
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike
There’s no excuse for you to say that we don’t think alike
You said you were going’ to Frisco, stay a couple of months
I always like San Francisco, I was there for a party once
Maybe someday you’ll see that it’s true
There was no greater love than what I had for you

[Intro]
Don't ever try to change me
I been in this thing too long
There's nothing' you can say or do
To make me think I'm wrong

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm going' off to Libya
There's a guy I gotta see
He's been living there three years now
In an oil refinery
I've got my mind made up
Oh, I have got my mind made up

[Verse 2]
Call your Ma in Tallahassee
Tell her her baby's on the line
Tell her not to worry
Everything is gonna be fine

[Verse 3]
Well, I gave you all my money
All my connections, too
There ain't nothing' in this world, girl
You can say I didn't give to you
I've got my mind made up
I've got my mind made up

[Verse 4]
You will be alright, girl
Someone's watching' over you
He won't do nothing' to you
Baby that I wouldn't do

[Outro]
Well, if you don't want to see me
Look the other way
You don't have to feed me
I ain't your dog that's gone astray
I got my mind made up
I got my mind made up
I got my mind made up
I got my mind made up
I got my mind made up

[Intro]
Something’ about you that I can’t shake
Don’t know how much more of this I can take
Baby, I’m under your spell

[Verse 1]
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light
Baby, oh what a story I could tell

It’s been nice seeing you, you read me like a book
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look
Baby, I’ll be at the same hotel

[Verse 2]
I’d like to help you but I’m in a bit of a jam
I’ll call you tomorrow if there’s phones where I am
Baby, caught between heaven and hell

But I will be back, I will survive
You’ll never get rid of me as long as you’re alive
Baby, can’t you tell

[Bridge]
Well it’s four in the morning by the sound of the birds
I’m staring’ at your picture, I’m hearing’ your words
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell

[Verse 3]
Everywhere you go it’s enough to break hearts
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow
I trusted your baby, you can trust me now

[Verse 4]
Turn back baby, wipe your eye
Don’t think I’m leaving here without a kiss goodbye
Baby, is there anything left to tell?

I’ll see you later when I’m not so out of my head
Maybe next time I’ll let the dead bury the dead
Baby, what more can I tell?

[Outro]
Well the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed
Pray that I don’t die of thirst
Baby, two feet from the well

[Intro]
Ohh
Okay
Okay

[Intro]
Once you've had something, something so beautiful
You'll never be the same

[Verse 1]
I'm a wild child, bright child, knockin' at your door
You thought that you were done but now you want me even more
Dum dum
You want me even more
Dum dum

[Verse 2]
I'm a star child, big smile, living in L.A
I'm coming over, baby, you can't go to school today
Dum dum
Go to school today
Dum dum

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I belong to a bygone era
Like the Scarlett O'Hara of the downtown scene
'Cause I just wanna dream, I just wanna drink
I'm a pop-blues singer, fam-bam zinger
Mansfield ringer from the Hollywood silver screen, silver screen

[Chorus]
Once you've had something, something so beautiful
You'll never be the same
Once you've had a taste of living my way
You'll be forever changed

[Verse 3]
I'm a wild child, sky high, lyin' on your floor
I know I had a lot, but baby wants a little more
Dum dum
Want a little more
Dum dum

[Verse 4]
In my white mink, pink cigarettes from the store
We're making robberies from Tijuana to the shore
Dum dum
'Juana to the shore
Dum dum

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I belong to a bygone era
Like the Bugsy Malone of the deep Sahara
'Cause I'm on the scene, yeah, I'm on the scene
I'm a bad jazz singer, givin' you the finger
No matter what, you'll linger
'Cause you like me even when I'm mean, I'm the queen

[Chorus]
Once you've had something, something so beautiful
You'll never be the same
Once you've had a taste of living my way
You'll be forever changed
Once you've had something, something so beautiful
You'll never be the same
Once you've had a taste of living my way
You'll be forever changed
Well, she's got Jet Pilot eyes from her hips on down
All the bombardiers are trying to force her out of town
She's five feet nine and she carries a monkey wrench
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch
She got all the downtown boys, all at her command
But you've got to watch her closely cause she ain't no woman
She's a man

[Verse 1]
You will search, babe
At any cost
But how long, babe
Can you search for what is not lost?

Everybody will help you
Some people are very kind
But if I can save you any time
Come on, give it to me
I'll keep it with mine

[Verse 2]
I can't help it
If you might think I am odd
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are
But for what you're not

Everybody will help you
Discover what you set out to find
But if I can save you any time
Come on, give it to me
I'll keep it with mine

[Verse 3]
The train leaves
At half past ten
But it will be back
In the same old spot again

The conductor
He's still stuck on the line
And if I can save you any time
Come on, give it to me
I’ll keep it with mine

[Verse 1]
Bad news, bad news
Come to me where I sleep
Turn, turn, turn again
Sayin’ one of your friends
Is in trouble deep
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
Tell me the trouble
Tell once to my ear
Turn, turn, turn again
Joliet prison
And ninety-nine years
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

[Verse 2]
Oh what’s the charge
Of how this came to be
Turn, turn, turn again
Manslaughter
In the highest of degrees
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
I sat down and wrote
The best words I could write
Turn, turn, turn again
Explaining to the judge
I’d be there on Wednesday night
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

[Verse 3]
Without a reply
I left by the moon
Turn, turn, turn again
And was in his chambers
By the next afternoon
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
Could ya tell me the facts?
I said without fear
Turn, turn, turn again
That a friend of mine
Would get ninety-nine years
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

[Verse 4]
A crash on the highway
Flew the car to a field
Turn, turn, turn again
There was four persons killed
And he was at the wheel
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
But I knew him as good
As I’m knowing myself
Turn, turn, turn again
And he wouldn’t harm a life
That belonged to someone else
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

[Verse 5]
The judge spoke
Out of the side of his mouth
Turn, turn, turn again
Sayin’, “The witness who saw
He left little doubt”
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
That may be true
He’s got a sentence to serve
Turn, turn, turn again
But ninety-nine years
He just don’t deserve
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

[Verse 6]
Too late, too late
For his case it is sealed
Turn, turn, turn again
His sentence is passed
And it cannot be repealed
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
But he ain’t no criminal
And his crime it is none
Turn, turn, turn again
What happened to him
Could happen to anyone
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

[Verse 7]
And at that the judge jerked forward
And his face it did freeze
Turn, turn, turn again
Sayin’, “Could you kindly leave
My office now, please”
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
Well his eyes looked funny
And I stood up so slow
Turn, turn, turn again
With no other choice
Except for to go
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

[Verse 8]
I walked down the hallway
And I heard his door slam
Turn, turn, turn again
I walked down the courthouse stairs
And I did not understand
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
And I played my guitar
Through the night to the day
Turn, turn, turn again
And the only tune
My guitar could play
Was, “Oh the Cruel Rain
And the Wind”

[Verse 1]
I got mixed up confusion
Man, it’s a-killing me
Well, there’s too many people
And they’re all too hard to please

[Verse 2]
Well, my hat’s in my hand
Babe, I’m walking down the line
An’ I’m looking for a woman
Whose head’s mixed up like mine

[Verse 3]
Well, my head’s full of questions
My temperature’s rising fast
Well, I’m looking for some answers
But I don’t know who to ask

[Verse 4]
But I’m walking and wondering
And my poor feet don’t ever stop
Seeing my reflection
I’m hung over, hung down, hung up!

[Verse 1]
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost
From the city of seven hills near the place of the cross
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy
Told about Jesus, told about the rain
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
By a man who had been dying and disappeared so mysteriously

[Verse 2]
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far
Were we sniper bait? Did we follow a star?
To a hole in the wall wall to where the long arm of the law can not reach?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech

[Verse 3]
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
Bringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fire

[Verse 4]
She looked into my soul through the clothes that I wore
She said, “We got a mutual friend over by the door
And you know he’s got our best interest in mind”
He was well connected but her heart was a snare
And she had left him to die in there
There were payments due and he was a little behind

[Verse 5]
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head
Ceiling fan broken, there’s a heat in my bed
Street band playing “Nearer My God to Thee”
We met at the steeple where the mission bells ring
She said, “I know what you’re thinking, but there ain’t a thing
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree”

[Verse 6]
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
Bringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fire

[Verse 7]
Atlantic City by the cold grey sea
I hear a voice crying, “Daddy,” I always think it’s for me
But it’s only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call
Every new messenger brings evil report
’Bout armies on the march and time that is short
And famines and earthquakes and hatred written upon walls

[Verse 8]
Would I have married her? I don’t know, I suppose
She had bells in her braids and they hung to her toes
But I kept hearing my name and had to be moving on
I saw screws break loose, saw the devil pound tin
I saw a house in the country being torn from within
I heard my ancestors calling from the land far beyond

[Verse 9]
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
Bringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fire

[Verse 1]
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing
Now somebody’s got to show their hand, time is an enemy
I know you’re long gone, I guess it must be up to me

[Verse 2]
If I’d thought about it I never would’ve done it, I guess I would’ve let it slide
If I'd-a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me would’ve died
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me

[Verse 3]
Now the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom
I’ve only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume
In fourteen months I’ve only smiled once and I didn’t do it consciously
Somebody’s got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me

[Verse 4]
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch
I’d just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me

[Verse 5]
Now I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers’ club
I would’ve followed you in the door, but I didn’t have a ticket stub
So I waited all night ’til the break of day, hoping one of us could get free
When the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me

[Verse 6]
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
You looked a little burned out my friend, I thought it might be up to me

[Verse 7]
I met somebody face to face, I had to remove my hat
She’s everything I need and love, but I can’t be swayed by that
It frightens me, the awful truth, of how sweet life can be
But she ain’t goin' to make a move, I guess it must be up to me

[Verse 8]
Now we heard the Sermon on the Mount, and I knew it was too complex
It didn’t amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty
Somebody’s got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me

[Verse 9]
Dupree came in pimpin’ tonight to the Thunderbird Café
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way
Now I just can’t rest without you, love, I need your company
You ain’t goin' to cross the line, I guess it must be up to me

[Verse 10]
There’s a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle
She’s the one you been wondering about, but there’s really nothing much to tell
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is history
Somebody’s got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me

[Verse 11]
So go on boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don’t have all that much time
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain’t my property
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me

[Verse 12]
If we never meet again, baby, remember me
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you, free
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I want to leave my lonesome home
And sometimes I’m in the mood, I want to hear my milk cow moan
And sometimes I’m in the mood, I want to hit that highway road
But then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I said
Oh babe, I’m in the mood for you

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I’m in the mood, Lord, I had my overflowing fill
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I’m going to make out my final will
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I’m going to head for the walking hill
But then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I said
Oh babe, I’m in the mood for you

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I want to lay right down and die
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I want to climb up to the sky
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I’m going to laugh until I cry
But then again, I said again, I said again, I said
Oh babe, I’m in the mood for you

[Verse 4]
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I’m going to sleep in my pony’s stall
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I ain’t going to do nothing at all
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I want to fly like a cannonball
But then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I said
Oh babe, I’m in the mood for you

[Verse 5]
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I want to back up against the wall
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I want to run till I have to crawl
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I ain’t going to do nothing at all
But then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I said
Oh babe, I’m in the mood for you

[Verse 6]
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I want to change my house around
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I’m going to make a change in this here town
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I’m going to change the world around
But then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I said
Oh babe, I’m in the mood for you

[Verse 1]
Well, the rainman comes with his magic wand
And the judge says, “Mona can’t have no bond”
And the walls collide, Mona cries
And the rainman leaves in the Wolfman’s disguise

[Chorus]
I want to be your lover, baby, I want to be your man
I want to be your lover, baby
I don’t want to be hers, I want to be yours

[Verse 2]
Well, the undertaker in his midnight suit
Says to the masked man, “Ain’t you cute!”
Well, the mask man he gets up on the shelf
And he says, “You ain’t so bad yourself”

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well, jumping Judy can’t go no higher
She had bullets in her eyes, and they fire
Rasputin he’s so dignified
He touched the back of her head an’ he died

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass
Stretching out upon the grass
She gets all messed up and she faints
That’s ’cause she’s so obvious and you ain’t

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
In the night, where I live, there's
Strange force in your kiss, oh
All's divine in desire

With an ire of philosophy
Burning scrolls in the naked heat
Oh, how coy
Is your little boy—no!

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I know
It don't read that well, yeah

[Chorus 1]
I got (I got)
Buried (buried)
No, it won't be long
Before I rise in—

I got (I got)
Buried (buried)
No it won't be long, yeah...

[Verse 2]
In the night, where I live
Your children sway; they fuel the kitsch
Raise their glass to Soviet crimes
In the war and in shadows

I write in tongues of old
Fumes are falling, smelling burned
Like always
Yes, always. Now, hear!

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I know
It don't read that well
And I know
Only time will tell me

[Chorus 2]
I got (I got)
Buried (buried)
No, it won't be long
Before I rise in—

I got (I got)
Buried (buried)
No, it won't be long
Before I rise in song!

[Instrumental]

[Pre-Chorus 3]
And I know
It don't read that well, yeah!

[Chorus 3]
I got (I got)
Buried (buried)
No, it won't be long
Before I rise in—

I got (I got)
Woah, buried (buried)
But no!
'Cause I know I got you!

[Verse 1]
Say, the pressure’s plain to see yea
Written all over me babe
I need you day and night
Help me, sometimes when the world is fallin’ over me
Seems there’s nothing I can do to bring release
Say my love
Take me now
You’re my drug

[Hook]
Ooh pressure too thicke
When you move pressure moves with
Only you make me lose it
You got me so electrified
Ooh pressure movin
When you goove
Cuts right through my skin
Only you take it perfect
You got me so electrified

[Verse 2]
Say, I don’t wanna work no more I wanna play
People in my face don’t hear a word they say
Every thought, all my wants, your my drug
Let me, put you in my mouth I love the way you taste
I just wanna savour you till morning breaks
Hey my love, take me high, everything I do is for us

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Feel the pressure
Feel the pressure
Feel the pressure
Can you feel it baby

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Palm trees in black and white
Last thing I saw before I died
Palm trees in black and white
Was the last thing I saw before I died
Bright light, right man
Right mixture of cocaine and heroin

[Chorus]
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you, do you wanna?

[Verse 2]
Hair thinnin' in the wind
Cadillac convertible with him
All shot at 2 a.m.
You got the grin of a very old man

[Chorus]
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you, do you wanna?

[Verse 3]
Palm trees in black and white
You are a junkie on your window smilin' wide
Palm trees in black and white
Lean forward and you close your eyes
Last fight, fuck them
Last words before you went under again

[Chorus]
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you, do you, do you wanna?

[Outro]
Just do what you love
Just do what you can
Just do what you love
Just do what you can
Just do what you love
Do it better than
Just do what you love
Do it better than
(Do you wanna?
Do you, do you wanna?
Jump, jump, jump)

[Verse 1]
As I was out walking on a corner one day
I spied an old hobo, in a doorway he lay
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
And I guess he’d been there for the whole night or more

[Chorus]
Only a hobo, but one more is gone
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song
Leaving nobody to carry him home
Only a hobo, but one more is gone

[Verse 2]
A blanket of newspaper covered his head
As the curb was his pillow, the street was his bed
One look at his face showed the hard road he’d come
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down
To look up on the world from a hole in the ground
To wait for your future like a horse that’s gone lame
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?

[Chorus]

[Verse: Anthony Kiedis]
Life is my friend, rake it up to take it in
Wrap me in your cinnamon, especially in Michigan
Well, I could be your friend
White clouds, I'm in a mitten full of fisherman
C'mon, Huckleberry Finn, show me how to make her grin
Well, I'm in Michigan

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Cry me a future where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and tigers come running just to steal your luck
Uh-uck, uh-uck

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
(A rainy Lithuanian, who's dancing as an Indian)
(Painted in my tiger skin, especially in Michigan)
Double chins and bowling pins, unholy Presbyterians
Land is full of medicine, I find it when I'm slipping in
(The tainted new librarian, who fainted when she tucked you in)
Well, I'm in Michigan
(Let's float away like zeppelins on stoic gusts of Northern wind)

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]
Cry me a future where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and tigers come running just to steal your luck
Uh-uck, uh-uck
Out on the farm, we'll be swimming with the mother duck
Deep in the mitten
Where lions and tigers come running just to steal your luck
Uh-uck, uh-uck

[Guitar Solo: Omar Rodríguez-López]

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
Life is my friend, underwater violins
Order now from Ho Chi Min, a porcelain that comes in twins
(Throw me in the loony bin, 'cause I can take it on the chin)
When I’m in Michigan
(The cleavage of your pillow skin is moving like a violin)

[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Cry me a future where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and tigers come running just to steal your luck
Uh-uck, uh-uck

[Outro: Anthony Kiedis]
Out on the farm, we'll be swimming with the mother duck
Deep in the mitten
Where lions and tigers come running just to steal your luck
Uh-uck, uh-uck
Yeah

[Intro]
I have a poem here. It's not a poem, it's... This is the first concert I played alone in New York, really. An a fellow in Brooklyn State Hospital, his name is Woody Guthrie. But Woody is more than a folk singer. He's really something else more than a folk singer and there's this book coming out that's dedicated to him. And they asked me to write something about Woody, like what does Woody mean to you in 25 words. And I couldn't do it, I wrote out 5 pages and I have it here. I have it here by accident actually. But I'd like to say this out loud. So this is my feelings towards Woody Guthrie. Cannot really be told in how many records of his I buy, it's a lot more than that actually. So if you can roll along with this thing here this is called "Last Thoughts On Woody Guthrie"

[Verse 1]
When yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart or too dumb
When yer laggin' behind an' losing yer pace
In a slow-motion crawl of life's busy race
No matter what yer doing if you start givin' up
If the wine don't come to the top of yer cup
If the wind's got you sideways with one hand holdin' on
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone
And yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it
And the wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it
And yer sidewalk starts curlin' and the street gets too long
And you start walkin' backwards though you know its wrong
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away
And you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'
And yer rope is a-slidin' cause yer hands are a-drippin'
And yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Turn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys
And yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe's a-pourin'
And the lightnin's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashin'
And the windows are rattlin' and breakin' and the roof tops a-shakin'
And yer whole world's a-slamming  and banging
And yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm
And to yourself you sometimes say
"I never knew it was gonna be this way
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born"
And you start gettin' chills and yer jumping from sweat
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet
And yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air
And the whole world's a-watching with a window peek stare
And yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying
And yer heart feels sick like fish when they're frying
And yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet
And you need it badly but it lays on the street
And yer bell's bangin' loudly but you can't hear its beat
And you think yer ears might a been hurt
Or yer eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt
And you figured you failed in yesterdays rush
When you were faked out an' fooled while facing a four flush
And all the time you were holdin' three queens
And it's making you mad, it's makin' you mean
Like in the middle of Life magazine
Bouncin' around a pinball machine
And there's something on yer mind you wanna be saying
That somebody someplace oughta be hearin'
But it's trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed
And no matter how you try you just can't say it
And yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it
And yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head
And yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead
And the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth
And his jaws start closing with you underneath
And yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign
And you say to yourself just what am I doing
On this road I'm walkin', on this trail I'm turnin'
On this curve I'm hanging
On this pathway I'm strolling, in the space I'm taking
In this air I'm inhaling
Am I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard
Why am I walking, where am I running
What am I saying, what am I knowing
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm frailin'
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in the song I'm singin'
In the tune I'm humming, in the words I'm writin'
In the words that I'm thinking
In this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinkin'
Who am I helping, what am I breaking
What am I giving, what am I taking
But you try with your whole soul best
Never to think these thoughts and never to let
Them kind of thoughts gain ground
Or make yer heart pound
But then again you know when they're around
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
'Cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creeping
And you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping
And you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin'
And you can't remember for the best of yer thinking
If that was you in the dream that was screaming
And you know that it's something special you're needin'
And you know that there's no drug that'll do for the healin'
And no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding
And you need something special
Yeah, you need something special all right
You need a fast flying train on a tornado track
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back
You need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever
That knows yer troubles a hundred times over
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race
That won't laugh at yer looks
Your voice or your face
And by any number of bets in the book
Will be rolling long after the bubblegum craze
You need something to open up a new door
To show you something you seen before
But overlooked a hundred times or more
You need something to open your eyes
You need something to make it known
That it's you and no one else that owns
That spot that yer standing, that space that you're sitting
That the world ain't got you beat
That it ain't got you licked
It can't get you crazy no matter how many
Times you might get kicked
You need something special all right
You need something special to give you hope
But hope's just a word
That maybe you said or maybe you heard
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve

[Bridge]
But that's what you need man, and you need it bad
And yer trouble is you know it too good
'Cause you look an' you start getting the chills

[Verse 2]
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill
And it ain't on Macy's window sill
And it ain't on no rich kid's road map
And it ain't in no fat kid's fraternity house
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ
And it ain't on that dimlit stage
With that half-wit comedian on it
Ranting and raving and taking yer money
And you think it's funny
No you can't find it in no night club or no yacht club
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club
And sure as hell you're bound to tell
That no matter how hard you rub
You just ain't a-gonna find it on yer ticket stub
No, and it ain't in the rumors people're tellin' you
And it ain't in the pimple-lotion people are sellin' you
And it ain't in no cardboard-box house
Or down any movie star's blouse
And you can't find it on the golf course
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus
And it ain't in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothes
And it ain't in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons
And it ain't in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices
That come knockin' and tappin' in Christmas wrappin'
Sayin' ain't I pretty and ain't I cute and look at my skin
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry
When you can't even sense if they got any insides
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows
No you'll not now or no other day
Find it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache
And inside it the people made of molasses
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies
Who'd turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack
And before you can count from one to ten
Do it all over again but this time behind yer back
My friend
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl
And play games with each other in their sand-box world
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
That run around gallant
And make all rules for the ones that got talent
And it ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
And think they're foolin' you
The ones who jump on the wagon
Just for a while cause they know it's in style
To get their kicks, get out of it quick
And make all kinds of money and chicks
And you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat
Sayin', "Christ do I gotta be like that
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel
Good God Almighty
THAT STUFF AIN'T REAL"
No but that ain't yer game, it ain't yer race
You can't hear yer name, you can't see yer face
You gotta look some other place
And where do you look for this hope that yer seekin'
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burnin'
Where do you look for this oil well gushin'
Where do you look for this candle that's glowin'
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there
And out there somewhere
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways
You can touch and twist
And turn two kinds of doorknobs
You can either go to the church of your choice
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital
You'll find God in the church of your choice
You'll find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital

[Outro]
And though it's only my opinion
I may be right or wrong
You'll find them both
In the Grand Canyon
At sundown
Dis nigga, like he's so exclusive
Sometimes dreams, peace of paper I got reams
Where the D go?, Put that on a rose now you
Pronounce it hero, you see?
Lu see like La Brea & Pico, with binoculars on my peephole
I feel my best work was album zero
Now with Deniro its boo boo in my backyard and
Ben burnt down my gazebo that dinero's a casino
Wit spit in the sandwich of the police though
They ain't see the steel plate up under my seat though
Still play it like Shaquille but I can free throw
I ain't playing but I compete, I ain't a player but I'm complete
And that's the win win a mason mind can't sign if the pen's Templar
Night vision on white linen is still green
Peace of Paper I got reams, make it rain
To make em smile, now rake it into piles
And go buy ya self some style, prom night/cat walk
Prepared the suit for weeks, or effortless as a Parisian
Walking down the street, I ain't in it
I'm just walking round some beats
Tongue in cheek, just talking round some teeth
Neighborhood watching
Made of good options, mastermind times
Neighborhood hoodie take the hood shopping
Back track to the stolen plates
What's a closed wallet to an open safe
Say your grace
Peace of Paper/Cup of Jayzus what we writing?
These ain't entendres these are secret indictments
Litte secret excitements
For willing minds I'm feeling fine
Balling hard and killing rhymes
Knocking off bigs and stealing shines
Hey shawty is it a crime?
To DMV everytime until I give em license
They waiting on lines
Peace of Paper I'm Kerry James
Commissions fly as the Constitution as a plane
Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS what we doing?
Pizza Lasers/ Cup of Razors
What you choosing?
Choosy mothers choose the smoothest peanut butters
And more cognizant fathers do George Washington Carver
A break from the paper it means do you identify more
With what's being made or the maker?
I'm what's being chased
I'm not the chaser
Cup of JAYZUS Peace of Paper
Check it, now paper make a plane & paper make it rain
But how fly is paper plane in the rain?
I'm fly paper on the brain
This and two-ply paper just ain't the same
I do do it for the bottom
In the air is where I stop em
I threw words like 2 birds, that's Batman and Robin
To answer all your hunches that's just how I throw my punches
We must somehow become a family that's why I throw 'em in bunches
Mushroom clouds or on the flo' with the fungus
If you look em up and down
From the foot to where he put his crown
The slow Pan to understand is Shaq on the shoulders of Yao
Over and over for miles
Peace of Paper, Cup of JAYZUS made a movie
Thank God on Friday, then buy a ruby on Tuesday
A couple beats from Jay, a couple beats from Ye
& make Food for thought, that's a restaurant in a day!
It would behoove thee
The critics say that I fell off I acknowledge I slipped
But what do you call falling from space into a bottomless pit?
And not pit like how Lui Kang can knock Baraka off with a hit
Knock it off for a bit
What would be really funny if I blew up after Drizzy
And started from the bottomless back to the topless like a watcher of Strips
Peace of Paper, Cup of JAYZUS
Peace of Paper, Cup of JAYZUS, bout it, bout it
Don't let ya inner fears result in a outer coward
From baby showers to 80 flowers upon my coffin roof
The upper class glass is not filled up with the coughing proof
Be more P and step ya Yessirs Up
P-O-P! Jayzus a cup of Courage, I can't can't
Thats double negative it's 2 earls
They really nice but they'll never touch the cup its like I gave it to two girls
This my odd future out in front Supreme shop
Fly as Rick Ross at a Wing Stop
Thought Kick Push was about drugs
It's not but just to be super sure
But from your perspective it might seem
Like Supreme out in front of Odd Future Store
So that skaters and skiers
Nose grinders and grinding up
Nose powders with ether
Not an Earl diss either but he might think it be and be like
"Lu's new should be Mr.Pure 2positive Shakur and 2 be sure he's
Not that really nice, That 2 girls and cup line sucked
It really means he gave himself a cup twice"
You just witnessed a double, a probable Odd Future diss in the future
And me ghostwriting my own rebuttals
You can't do that with a single cup
You gone need a couple, again you got a double
Got my shot on the rocks, but don't stop, keep pouring til it's a puddle
Peace of Paper, Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS what's the drive?
Greatest Rapper Alive or Greatest Rapper That Died?
Then on judgement day they say the greatest rapper's revived
Oh look who's here the greatest rapper's arrived!!
At the birthday party the greatest rapper surprised!!!
Bumped into Doom the greatest rappers collide
Everybody dead but AZ the greatest rapper survived
I'm not the greatest rapper... the greatest rappers' a lie
Got the same points as Lux the greatest rappers a tie
Told Jean, Foxy, & Rah the greatest rapper's a girl
They said the greatest rapper's a guy
Phone rang it was Ghost he said "Kiss the greatest rapper... Goodbye!"
Chris said Common, Common said Kweli, Talib said I'm sure it's Mos Definitely!!
Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS
Smack might have the greatest but now I'm just playing favorites
Playing flavored to be reminiscent of Miles on smack playing faded
Peace of.... these niggas is nice
Knees like these niggas aight
Shins like listen to them, ankles like shins making sense
Feet like why you running behind these niggas
They still trying to step inside ya prints
Bear trap rap don't step inside the clinch
Where da at? Don't jeopardize a better stride for limps
I exercise at length so electrify the fence
Let me inside the danger room on level 5 with the weaponized defense
With an extra side of the next guy's petty exercise attempts
The ghost of my career, better than most of what they revere
I take my targets and throw them back on my spear
I'm outta here
Drogas
Shaka Zulu

[Verse 1: Drake]
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

[Chorus: Drake]
Just hold on, we're going home
Just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we're going home

[Verse 2: Drake]
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

[Chorus: Drake & Majid Al Maskati]
So just hold on, we're going home (Going home)
Just hold on, we're going home (Going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (Things alone)

[Bridge: Majid Al Maskati]
You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you everything I loved

You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Drake & Majid Al Maskati]

I know exactly who you could be

[Chorus: Drake & Majid Al Maskati]
Oh, just hold on, we're going home (Going home)
Just hold on, we're going home (Going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (Things alone)
Just hold on, we're going home (Going home)
Home (Going home)

[Outro: Majid Al Maskati]
Hold on
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Well, a young marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred
The man put us together, now, you wanna make it
Stick together
Come on, come on, stick together

[Verse 2]
You know, you made a vow, not to leave one another, never
Well, ya never miss you water till your well runs dry
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together
Come on, come on, stick together
We made a vow, not to leave one another, never

[Verse 3]
Well, ya never miss your water till your well runs dry
Come one, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together
Come on, come on, stick together
You know, we made a vow, not to leave one another, never

[Verse 4]
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy
Let's stick together
Come on, come on, stick together
You know, we made a vow, not to leave one another, never

[Verse 1]
When did you leave heaven?
How could they let you go?
How's every thing in heaven?
I'd like to know

[Verse 2]
Why did you trade heaven?
For all these earthly things?
Where on earth you hide halo?
Where did you lose your wings?

[Verse 3]
Have they missed you?
Can you get back in?
If I kiss you would it be a sin?
I am only human but you are so divine
When did you leave heaven angel mine?

[Verse 1]
Look who's back in town
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown
All you boys better run for cover
If you don't a-wanna be a broken hearted lover

[Verse 2]
See her in that very tight skirt
Got what it takes
Just to make you hurt
Don't be deceived by those big bright eyes
Prefer to treat her nasty and low down lies

[Pre-Chorus]
Makes no difference where she's been
I'm go in south and doing them things again
Bake in a hot tub, down the line
I'd rather see you ruin this a-heart of mine

[Chorus]
I'll go see them come down my way
Like a fool you're gonna hear me say
"I'll lay at your bed Sally Sue Brown
Please let me love you, baby
Don't put me down"

[Pre-Chorus]
Makes no difference where she's been
I'm go in south and doing them things again
Bake in a hot tub, down the line
I'd rather see you ruin this a-heart of mine

[Chorus]
I'll go see them come down my way
Like a fool you're gonna hear me say
"I'll lay at your bed Sally Sue Brown
Please let me love you, baby
Don't put me down"

[Verse 1]
When you’re sad and when you’re lonely
And you haven’t got a friend
Just remember that death is not the end
And all that you’ve held sacred
Falls down and does not mend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end

[Verse 2]
When you’re standing at the crossroads
That you cannot comprehend
Just remember that death is not the end
And all your dreams have vanished
And you don’t know what’s up the bend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end

[Verse 3]
When the storm clouds gather ’round you
And heavy rains descend
Just remember that death is not the end
And there’s no one there to comfort you
With a helping hand to lend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end

[Bridge]
Oh, the tree of life is growing
Where the spirit never dies
And the bright light of salvation shines
In dark and empty skies

[Verse 4]
When the cities are on fire
With the burning flesh of men
Just remember that death is not the end
And you search in vain to find
Just one law-abiding citizen
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end

[Verse 1]
I got to see you baby, I don’t care
It may be someplace, baby, you say where

[Chorus]
I had a dream about you, baby
Had a dream about you, baby
Late last night you come a-rolling across my mind

[Verse 2]
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk
You make me nervous when you start to talk

[Chorus]
I had a dream about you, baby
Had a dream about you, baby
Late last night you come a-rolling across my mind

[Verse 3]
Standing on the highway, you flag me down
Said, take me Daddy, to the nearest town

[Chorus]
I had a dream about you, baby
Had a dream about you, baby
Late last night you come a-rolling across my mind

[Bridge]
The joint is jumping
It’s really something
The beat is pumping
My heart is thumping
Spent my money on you honey
My limbs are shaking
My mind is breaking

[Verse 4]
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop
You make me so mad, I tell you to stop

[Chorus]
I had a dream about you, baby
Had a dream about you, baby
Late last night you come a-rolling across my mind

[Verse 5]
You wear a blue scarf upon your head
Wearing a long dress fire engine red

[Chorus]
I had a dream about you, baby
Had a dream about you, baby
Late last night you come a-rolling across my mind

[Verse 1]
The woman that I love she got a hook in her nose
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second hand clothes
She speaks with a stutter and she walks with a hop
I don't know why I love her but I just can't stop

[Chorus]
You know I love her
Yeah I love her
I'm in love with the Ugliest Girl in the World

[Verse 2]
If I ever lose her I will go insane
I go half crazy when she calls my name
When she says baby I l-l-love you
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The woman that I love she got two flat feet
Her knees knock together walking down the street
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed
She ain't much to look at but like I said

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own
When I get low she sets me on my feet
Got a five inch smile but her breath is sweet

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
The woman that I love she a got a prizefighter nose
Cauliflower ears and a run in her hose
She speaks with a stutter and she walks with a hop
I don't know why I love her but I just can't stop

[Verse 1]
Stake my future on a hell of a past
Looks like tomorrow is coming on fast
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got
Seen better times, but who has not?

[Chorus]
Silvio
Silver and gold
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
Silvio
I gotta go
Find out something only dead men know

[Verse 2]
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone
When I come knocking don't throw me no bone
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
If you don't like it you can leave me alone

[Verse 3]
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
From a clear blue sky and turn it off again
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain
And charm the whistle off an evening train

[Verse 4]
I give what I got until I got no more
I take what I get until I even the score
You know I love you and furthermore
When it's time to go you got an open door

[Verse 5]
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain
You give something up for everything you gain
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain
Pay for your ticket and don't complain

[Verse 6]
One of these days and it won't be long
Going down in the valley and sing my song
I will sing it loud and sing it strong
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong

[Chorus]
Silvio
Silver and gold
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
Silvio
I gotta go
Find out something only dead men know

[Verse 1]
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done
Instead of stopping when we could we went right on
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone

[Verse 2]
You belong to someone else, and I do too
It's just crazy bein' here with you
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
Ninety miles an hour down a dead end street

[Verse 3]
I didn't want to want you, but now I have no choice
It's too late to listen to that warning voice
All I hear is thunder of two hearts beat
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
Ninety miles an hour down a dead end street

[Verse 4]
You're not free to belong to me
And you know I could never be your own
Your lips on mine are like a sweet, sweet wine
But we're heading for a wall of stone

[Verse 5]
Warning signs are flashing every where, but we pay no heed
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a picking up speed
Disaster's getting closer every time we meet
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead end street

[Verse 1]
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you
Look away, you rolling river
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you
Look away. We're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

[Verse 2]
Now the Missouri is a mighty river
Look away, you rolling river
Indians camp along her border
Look away. We're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

[Verse 3]
Well a white man loved an Indian maiden
Look away, you rolling river
With notions his canoe was laden
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

[Verse 4]
Oh Shenandoah, I love your daughter
Look away, you rolling river
It was for her I'd cross the water
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

[Verse 5]
For seven long years I courted Sally
Look away, you rolling river
Seven more years I longed to have her
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

[Verse 6]
Well, it's fare-thee-well, my dear
I'm bound to leave you
Look away you rolling river
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

[Verse 1]
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Where in youth's early days I was happy and free
I looked for my friends but I never could find them
I found they were all rank strangers to me

[Chorus]
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger
No mother or dad not a friend could I see
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces
I found they were all rank strangers to me

[Verse 2]
They all moved away, said a voice of a stranger
"To that beautiful home by the bright crystal sea"
Some beautiful day I'll meet them in heaven
Where no one will be a stranger to me

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Come you ladies and you gentlemen, a-listen to my song
Sing it to you right, but you might think it’s wrong
Just a little glimpse of a story I’ll tell
’Bout an East Coast city that you all know well
It’s hard times in the city
Living’ down in New York town

[Verse 2]
Old New York City is a friendly old town
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down
There’s a-mighty many people all milling’ all around
They’ll kick you when you’re up and knock you when you’re down
It’s hard times in the city
Living’ down in New York town

[Verse 3]
Well, the weekend is strong and the rich and the poor
Get there together in roof an' no more
Crowdin' up 'bove and crowdin' down below
And someone disappears, you never even know
And it's hard times from the country, livin' down in New York town

[Verse 4]
It’s a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
To Rockefeller Plaza ’n’ the Empire State
Mister Empire sets up as high as a bird
Old Mister Rockefeller never says a word
It’s hard times from the country
Living’ down in New York town

[Verse 5]
Well, it’s up in the morning’ trying’ to find a job of work
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt
If you got a lot o’ money you can make yourself merry
If you only got a nickel, it’s the Staten Island Ferry
And it’s hard times in the city
Living’ down in New York town

[Verse 6]
Mister Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
And old Mister Minuet paid for his dream
Bought your city on a one-way track
’F I had my way I’d sell it right back
And it’s hard times in the city
Living’ down in New York town

[Verse 7]
I’ll take all the smog in Cal-i-for-ne-ay
’N’ every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
’N’ the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines
It’s all much cleaner than the New York kind
And it’s hard times in the city
Living’ down in New York town

[Verse 8]
So all you newsy people, spread the news around
You can listen to m’ story, listen to m’ song
You can step on my name, you can try ’n’ get me beat
When I leave New York, I’ll be standing’ on my feet
And it’s hard times in the city
Living’ down in New York town

[Verse 1]
We live in a political world
Love don’t have any place
We’re living in times where men commit crimes
And crime don’t have a face

[Verse 2]
We live in a political world
Icicles hanging down
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
Clouds cover up the ground

[Verse 3]
We live in a political world
Wisdom is thrown into jail
It rots in a cell, is misguided as hell
Leaving no one to pick up a trail

[Verse 4]
We live in a political world
Where mercy walks the plank
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
Up the steps into the nearest bank

[Verse 5]
We live in a political world
Where courage is a thing of the past
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted
The next day could be your last

[Verse 6]
We live in a political world
The one we can see and can feel
But there’s no one to check, it’s all a stacked deck
We all know for sure that it’s real

[Verse 7]
We live in a political world
In the cities of lonesome fear
Little by little you turn in the middle
But you’re never sure why you’re here

[Verse 8]
We live in a political world
Under the microscope
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there
You always got more than enough rope

[Verse 9]
We live in a political world
Turning and a-thrashing about
As soon as you’re awake, you’re trained to take
What looks like the easy way out

[Verse 10]
We live in a political world
Where peace is not welcome at all
It’s turned away from the door to wander some more
Or put up against the wall

[Verse 11]
We live in a political world
Everything is hers or his
Climb into the frame and shout God’s name
But you’re never sure what it is

[Verse 1]
Far away where the soft winds blow
Far away from it all
There is a place you go
Where teardrops fall

[Verse 2]
Far away in the stormy night
Far away and over the wall
You are there in the flickering light
Where teardrops fall

[Verse 3]
We banged the drum slowly
And played the fife lowly
You know the song in my heart
In the turning of twilight
In the shadows of moonlight
You can show me a new place to start

[Verse 4]
I’ve torn my clothes and I’ve drained the cup
Stripping away at it all
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Where teardrops fall

[Verse 5]
By rivers of blindness
In love and with kindness
We could hold up a toast if we meet
To the cutting of fences
To sharpen the senses
That linger in the fireball heat

[Verse 6]
Roses are red, violets are blue
And time is beginning to crawl
I just might have to come see you
Where teardrops fall

[Intro]
Broken lines, broken strings
Broken threads, broken springs
Broken idols, broken heads
People sleeping in broken beds
Ain’t no use jiving
Ain’t no use joking
Everything is broken

[Verse 1]
Broken bottles, broken plates
Broken switches, broken gates
Broken dishes, broken parts
Streets are filled with broken hearts
Broken words never meant to be spoken
Everything is broken

Seem like every time you stop and turn around
Something else just hit the ground

[Verse 2]
Broken cutters, broken saws
Broken buckles, broken laws
Broken bodies, broken bones
Broken voices on broken phones
Take a deep breath, feel like you’re choking
Everything is broken
Every time you leave and go off someplace
Things fall to pieces in my face

[Outro]
Broken hands on broken ploughs
Broken treaties, broken vows
Broken pipes, broken tools
People bending broken rules
Hound dog howling, bullfrog croaking
Everything is broken

[Verse 1]
Ring them bells, ye heathen
From the city that dreams
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries
’Cross the valleys and streams
For they’re deep and they’re wide
And the world’s on its side
And time is running backwards
And so is the bride

[Verse 2]
Ring them bells St. Peter
Where the four winds blow
Ring them bells with an iron hand
So the people will know
Oh, it’s rush hour now
On the wheel and the plow
And the sun is going down
Upon the sacred cow

[Verse 3]
Ring them bells Sweet Martha
For the poor man’s son
Ring them bells so the world will know
That God is one
Oh, the shepherd is asleep
Where the willows weep
And the mountains are filled
With lost sheep

[Verse 4]
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf
Ring them bells for all of us who are left
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Who will judge the many when the game is through
Ring them bells, for the time that flies
For the child that cries
When innocence dies

[Verse 5]
Ring them bells St. Catherine
From the top of the room
Ring them from the fortress
For the lilies that bloom
Oh, the lines are long
And the fighting is strong
And they’re breaking down the distance
Between right and wrong

[Verse 1]
Crickets are chirping, the water is high
There’s a soft cotton dress on the line hangin’ dry
Window wide open, African trees
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note
She gone with the man
In the long black coat

[Verse 2]
Somebody seen him hanging around
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask
Somebody said from the Bible he’d quote
There was dust on the man
In the long black coat

[Verse 3]
Preacher was a talkin’, there’s a sermon he gave
He said every man’s conscience is vile and depraved
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
When it’s you who must keep it satisfied
It ain’t easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat
She gave her heart to the man
In the long black coat

[Verse 4]
There are no mistakes in life some people say
It is true sometimes you can see it that way
But people don't live or die, people just float
She went with the man
In the long black coat

[Verse 5]
There’s smoke on the water, it’s been there since June
Tree trunks uprooted, 'neath the high crescent moon
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force
Somebody is out there beating a dead horse
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote
She gone with the man
In the long black coat

[Verse 1]
Most of the time
I’m clear focused all around
Most of the time
I can keep both feet on the ground
I can follow the path, I can read the signs
Stay right with it when the road unwinds
I can handle whatever I stumble upon
I don’t even notice she gone
Most of the time

[Verse 2]
Most of the time
It’s well understood
Most of the time
I wouldn’t change it if I could
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone
I can survive, I can endure
And I don’t even think about her
Most of the time

[Verse 3]
Most of the time
My head is on straight
Most of the time
I’m strong enough not to hate
I don’t build up illusion ’till it makes me sick
I ain’t afraid of confusion no matter how thick
I can smile in the face of mankind
Don’t even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Most of the time

[Bridge]
Most of the time
She ain’t even in my mind
I wouldn’t know her if I saw her
She’s that far behind
Most of the time
I can’t even be sure
If she was ever with me
Or if I was ever with her

[Verse 4]
Most of the time
I’m halfway content
Most of the time
I know exactly where it all went
I don’t cheat on myself, I don’t run and hide
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside
I don’t compromise and I don’t pretend
I don’t even care if I ever see her again
Most of the time

[Verse 1]
What good am I if I’m like all the rest
If I just turn away, when I see how you’re dressed
If I shut myself off so I can’t hear you cry
What good am I?

[Verse 2]
What good am I if I know and don’t do
If I see and don’t say, if I look right through you
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky
What good am I?

[Verse 3]
What good am I while you softly weep
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don’t try
What good am I?

[Verse 4]
What good am I then to others and me
If I’ve had every chance and yet still fail to see
If my hands are tied must I not wonder within
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?

[Verse 5]
What good am I if I say foolish things
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
And I just turn my back while you silently die
What good am I?

[Verse 1]
There’s a whole lot of people suffering tonight
From the disease of conceit
Whole lot of people struggling tonight
From the disease of conceit
Comes right down the highway
Straight down the line
Rips into your senses
Through your body and your mind
Nothing about it that’s sweet
The disease of conceit

[Verse 2]
There’s a whole lot of hearts breaking tonight
From the disease of conceit
Whole lot of hearts shaking tonight
From the disease of conceit
Steps into your room
Eats your soul
Over your senses
You have no control
Ain’t nothing too discreet
About the disease of conceit

[Verse 3]
There’s a whole lot of people dying tonight
From the disease of conceit
Whole lot of people crying tonight
From the disease of conceit
Comes right out of nowhere
And you’re down for the count
From the outside world
The pressure will mount
Turn you into a piece of meat
The disease of conceit

[Bridge]
Conceit is a disease
That the doctors got no cure
They’ve done a lot of research on it
But what it is, they’re still not sure

[Verse 4]
There’s a whole lot of people in trouble tonight
From the disease of conceit
Whole lot of people seeing double tonight
From the disease of conceit
Give ya delusions of grandeur
And a evil eye
Give you the idea that
You’re too good to die
Then they bury you from your head to your feet
From the disease of conceit

[Verse 1]
What was it you wanted?
Tell me again so I’ll know
What’s happening in there
What’s going on in your show
What was it you wanted
Could you say it again?
I’ll be back in a minute
You can get it together by then

[Verse 2]
What was it you wanted
You can tell me, I’m back
We can start it all over
Get it back on the track
You got my attention
Go ahead, speak
What was it you wanted
When you were kissing my cheek?

[Verse 3]
Was there somebody looking
When you give me that kiss
Someone there in the shadows
Someone that I might have missed?
Is there something you needed
Something I don’t understand
What was it you wanted
Do I have it here in my hand?

[Verse 4]
Whatever you wanted
Slipped out of my mind
Would you remind me again
If you’d be so kind
Has the record been breaking
Did the needle just skip
Is there somebody waiting
Was there a slip of the lip?

[Verse 5]
What was it you wanted
I ain’t keeping score
Are you the same person
That was here before?
Is it something important?
Maybe not
What was it you wanted?
Tell me again I forgot

[Verse 6]
Whatever you wanted
What could it be
Did somebody tell you
That you could get it from me
Is it something that comes natural
Is it easy to say
Why do you want it
Who are you anyway?

[Verse 7]
Is the scenery changing
Am I getting it wrong
Is the whole thing going backwards
Are they playing our song?
Where were you when it started
Do you want it for free
What was it you wanted
Are you talking to me?

[Verse 1]
Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of you
You were trying to break into another world
A world I never knew
I always kind of wondered
If you ever made it through
Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of you

[Verse 2]
Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of me
If I was still the same
If I ever became what you wanted me to be
Did I miss the mark or overstep the line
That only you could see?
Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of me

[Verse 3]
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
As the last fire truck from hell
Goes rolling by
All good people are praying
It’s the last temptation, the last account
The last time you might hear the sermon on the mount
The last radio is playing

[Verse 4]
Seen a shooting star tonight
Slip away
Tomorrow will be
Another day
Guess it’s too late to say the things to you
That you needed to hear me say
Seen a shooting star tonight
Slip away

[Verse 1]
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
And they lived in an alley under the red sky
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
And they lived in an alley under the red sky

[Verse 2]
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
One summer’s day he came passing by
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
And one day he came passing by

[Bridge]
Someday little girl, everything for you is gonna be new
Someday little girl, you’ll have a diamond as big as your shoe

[Verse 3]
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high
One day the little boy and the little girl were baked in a pie

[Bridge]
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town
This is the blind horse that leads you around

[Verse 4]
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly
The man in the moon went home and the river went dry

[Verse 1]
It’s unbelievable, it’s strange but true
It’s inconceivable it could happen to you
You go north and you go south
Just like bait in the fish’s mouth
You must be living’ in the shadow of some kind of evil star
It’s unbelievable it would get this far

[Verse 2]
It’s undeniable what they’d have you to think
It’s indescribable, it can drive you to drink
They said it was the land of milk and honey
Now they say it’s the land of money
Whoever thought they could ever make that stick
It’s unbelievable you can get this rich this quick

[Verse 3]
Every head is so dignified
Every moon is so sanctified
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you’re with me
All the silver, all the gold
All the sweethearts you can hold
That doesn’t come back with stories untold
Are hanging on a tree

[Verse 4]
It’s unbelievable like a lead balloon
It’s so impossible to even learn the tune
Kill that beast and feed that swine
Scale that wall and smoke that vine
Feed that horse and saddle up the drum
It’s unbelievable, the day would finally come

[Verse 5]
Once there was a man who had no eyes
Every lady in the land told him lies
He stood beneath the silver sky and his heart began to bleed
Every brain is civilized
Every nerve is analyzed
Everything is criticized when you are in need

[Verse 6]
It’s unbelievable, it’s fancy-free
So interchangeable, so delightful to see
Turn your back, wash your hands
There’s always someone who understands
It don’t matter no more what you got to say
It’s unbelievable it would go down this way

[Verse 1]
In the lonely night
In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light
You’re coming’ thru to me in black and white
When we were made of dreams

[Verse 2]
You’re blowing down the shaky street
You’re hearing my heart beat
In the record-breaking heat
Where we were born in time

[Verse 3]
Not one more night, not one more kiss
Not this time baby, no more of this
Takes too much skill, takes too much will
It’s revealing

[Verse 4]
You came, you saw, just like the law
You married young, just like your ma
You tried and tried, you made me slide
You left me reeling with this feeling

[Verse 5]
On the rising curve
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve
You won’t get anything you don’t deserve
Where we were born in time

[Verse 6]
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice
You hang the flame, you’ll pay the price
Oh babe, that fire

[Verse 7]
Is still smoking
You were snow, you were rain
You were striped, you were plain
Oh babe, truer words
Have not been spoken or broken

[Verse 8]
In the hills of mystery
In the foggy web of destiny
You can have what’s left of me
Where we were born in time

[Verse 1]
One time in London I’d gone out for a walk
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
’Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view
To anyone passing by, that’s who they’re talking to

[Verse 2]
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
About the T.V. god and all the pain that it invokes
“It’s too bright a light,” he said, “for anybody’s eyes
If you’ve never seen one it’s a blessing in disguise”

[Verse 3]
I moved in closer, got up on my toes
Two men in front of me were coming to blows
The man was saying something ’bout children when they’re young
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung

[Verse 4]
“The news of the day is on all the time
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free
Don’t let an egg get laid in it by something you can’t see”

[Verse 4]
“Pray for peace!” he said. You could feel it in the crowd
My thoughts began to wander. His voice was ringing loud
“It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on”

[Verse 5]
“It will lead you into some strange pursuits
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits
It will scramble up your head and drag your brain about
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out”

[Verse 6]
“It’s all been designed,” he said, “to make you lose your mind
And when you go back to find it, there’s nothing there to find
Every time you look at it, your situation’s worse
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse"

[Verse 7]
The crowd began to riot and they grabbed hold of the man
There was pushing, there was shoving and everybody ran
The T.V. crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me
Later on that evening, I watched it on T.V

The cat’s in the well, the wolf is looking down
The cat’s in the well, the wolf is looking down
He got his big bushy tail dragging all over the ground

[Verse 1]
The cat’s in the well, the gentle lady is asleep
Cat’s in the well, the gentle lady is asleep
She ain’t hearing a thing, the silence is a-stickin’ her deep

The cat’s in the well and grief is showing its face
The world’s being slaughtered and it’s such a bloody disgrace

[Verse 2]
The cat’s in the well, the horse is going bumpety bump
The cat’s in the well, and the horse is going bumpety bump
Back alley Sally is doing the American jump

The cat’s in the well, and Papa is reading the news
His hair’s falling out and all of his daughters need shoes

[Verse 3]
The cat’s in the well and the barn is full of bull
The cat’s in the well and the barn is full of bull
The night is so long and the table is oh, so full

The cat’s in the well and the servant is at the door
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war

[Outro]
The cat’s in the well, the leaves are starting to fall
The cat’s in the well, leaves are starting to fall
Goodnight, my love, may the Lord have mercy on us all

Ten thousand men on a hill
Ten thousand men on a hill

Drumming in the morning, in the evening they’ll be coming for you

Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom

[Outro]
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea!

It’s so sweet of you to be so nice to me

[Intro]
One by one, they followed the sun
One by one, until there were none
Two by two, to their lovers they flew
Two by two, into the foggy dew
Three by three, they danced on the sea
Four by four, they danced on the shore
Five by five, they tried to survive
Six by six, they were playing with tricks

[Verse 1]
How many paths did they try and fail?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
How much poison did they inhale?
How many black cats crossed their trail?

[Verse 2]
Seven by seven, they headed for heaven
Eight by eight, they got to the gate
Nine by nine, they drank the wine
Ten by ten, they drank it again

[Verse 3]
How many tomorrows have they given away?
How many compared to yesterday?
How many more without any reward?
How many more can they afford?

[Verse 4]
Two by two, they stepped into the ark
Two by two, they step in the dark
Three by three, they’re turning the key
Four by four, they turn it some more

[Outro]
One by one, they follow the sun
Two by two, to another rendezvous

[Intro]
God knows you ain’t pretty
God knows it’s true
God knows there ain’t anybody
Ever gonna take the place of you

[Verse 1]
God knows it’s a struggle
God knows it’s a crime
God knows there’s gonna be no more water
But fire next time

[Verse 2]
God don’t call it treason
God don’t call it wrong
It was supposed to last a season
But it’s been so strong for so long

[Verse 3]
God knows it’s fragile
God knows everything
God knows it could snap apart right now
Just like putting scissors to a string

[Verse 4]
God knows it’s terrifying
God sees it all unfold
There’s a million reasons for you to be crying
You been so bold and so cold

[Verse 5]
God knows that when you see it
God knows you’ve got to weep
God knows the secrets of your heart
He’ll tell them to you when you’re asleep

[Verse 6]
God knows there’s a river
God knows how to make it flow
God knows you ain’t gonna be taking
Nothing with you when you go

[Verse 7]
God knows there’s a purpose
God knows there’s a chance
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour
Of any circumstance

[Verse 8]
God knows there’s a heaven
God knows it’s out of sight
God knows we can get all the way from here to there
Even if we’ve got to walk a million miles by candlelight

Handy Dandy, controversy surrounds him
He been around the world and back again
Something in the moonlight still hounds him
Handy Dandy, just like sugar and candy

[Verse 1]
Handy Dandy, if every bone in his body was broken he would never admit it
He got an all-girl orchestra and when he says
“Strike up the band,” they hit it
Handy Dandy, Handy Dandy

[Verse 2]
You say, “What are ya made of?”
He says, “Can you repeat what you said?”
You’ll say, “What are you afraid of?”
He’ll say, “Nothin’! Neither ’live nor dead.”

[Verse 3]
Handy Dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money
He says, “Darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?”
She says, “You got all the time in the world, honey”
Handy Dandy, Handy Dandy

[Verse 4]
He’s got that clear crystal fountain
He’s got that soft silky skin
He’s got that fortress on the mountain
With no doors, no windows, no thieves can break in

[Verse 5]
Handy Dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy
He says, “Ya want a gun? I’ll give ya one.” She says, “Boy, you talking crazy”
Handy Dandy, just like sugar and candy
Handy Dandy, pour him another brandy

[Verse 6]
Handy Dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table, he says
“Okay, boys, I’ll see you tomorrow”
Handy Dandy, Handy Dandy, just like sugar and candy
Handy Dandy, just like sugar and candy

[Verse 1]
Well met, well met, my own true love
Well met, well met, cried she
I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
And it's all for the love of thee

[Verse 2]
I could have married a King's daughter there
She would have married me
But I have forsaken my King's daughter there
It's all for the love of thee

[Verse 3]
Well, if you could have married a King's daughter there
I'm sure you're the one to blame
For I am married to a house carpenter
And I'm sure he's a fine young man

[Verse 4]
Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
And come away with me
I'll take you where the green grass grows
On the shores of sunny Italy

[Verse 5]
So up she picked her babies three
And gave them kisses, one, two, three
Saying "take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
And keep him good company."

[Verse 6]
Well, they were sailing about two weeks
I'm sure it was not three
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck
Saying she wants company

[Verse 7]
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home?
Or are you weeping for your babies three?"
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter
I'm weeping for my babies three."

[Verse 8]
Oh what are those hills yonder, my love
They look as white as snow
Those are the hill of heaven, my love
You and I'll never know

[Verse 9]
Oh what are those hills yonder, my love
They look as dark as night
Those are the hills of hellfire my love
Where you and I will unite

[Verse 10]
Oh twice around went the gallant ship
I'm sure it was not three
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you can read out your Bible
You can fall down on your knees, pretty mama
And pray to the Lord
But it ain’t gonna do no good

[Chorus]
You’re gonna need
You’re gonna need my help someday
Well, if you can’t quit your sinning
Please quit your low down ways

[Verse 1]
Well, you can run down to the White House
You can gaze at the Capitol Dome, pretty mama
You can pound on the President’s gate
But you oughta know by now it’s gonna be too late

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Well, you can run down to the desert
Throw yourself on the burning sand
You can raise up your right hand, pretty mama
But you better understand you done lost your one good man

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And you can hitchhike on the highway
You can stand all alone by the side of the road
You can try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama
But you can’t ride in my car no more

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Intro]
The winter wind is a blowing strong
My hands have got no gloves
I wish to my soul that I could see
The girl I'm a-thinking of

[Verse 1]
Don't you remember me babe
I remember you quite well
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town
With a high sheriff on my trail

[Verse 2]
High sheriff on my trail, boys
High sheriff on my trail
All because I'm falling for
A curly-headed dark-eyed girl

[Verse 3]
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold black hair
And sandy colored skin
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips
When I'm out in the wind
When I'm out in the wind, babe
When I'm out in the wind
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth
When I'm out in the wind

[Verse 4]
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side
And tell you everything's alright
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long
And not just in the night
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side
Who's a-gonna be your man
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye
And hold your bad luck hand

[Verse 5]
Hold your bad luck hand, babe
Hold your bad luck hand
Who's a-gonna hold your hard luck hand
And who's a-gonna be your man

[Outro]
The winter wind is a blowing strong
My hands have got no gloves
I wish to my soul I could see
The girl I'm a-thinking of

[Chorus]
Well, I’m walking down the line
I’m walking down the line
An’ I’m walking down the line
My feet’ll be a-flying
To tell about my troubled mind

[Verse 1]
I got a heavy-headed gal
I got a heavy-headed gal
I got a heavy-headed gal
She ain’t a-feelin’ well
When she’s better only time will tell

[Chorus]
Well, I’m walking down the line
I’m walking down the line
An’ I’m walking down the line
My feet’ll be a-flying
To tell about my troubled mind

[Verse 2]
My money comes and goes
My money comes and goes
My money comes and goes
And rolls and flows and rolls and flows
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes

[Chorus]
Well, I’m walking down the line
I’m walking down the line
An’ I’m walking down the line
My feet’ll be a-flying
To tell about my troubled mind

[Verse 3]
I see the morning light
I see the morning light
Well, it’s not because
I’m an early riser
I didn’t go to sleep last night

[Chorus]
Well, I’m walking down the line
I’m walking down the line
An’ I’m walking down the line
My feet’ll be a-flying
To tell about my troubled mind

[Verse 4]
I got my walking shoes
I got my walking shoes
I got my walking shoes
An’ I ain’t a-gonna lose
I believe I got the walking blues

[Chorus]
Well, I’m walking down the line
I’m walking down the line
An’ I’m walking down the line
My feet’ll be a-flying
To tell about my troubled mind

[Verse 1]
Oh, the age of the inmates
I remember quite freely
No younger than twelve
No older ’n seventeen
Thrown in like bandits
And cast off like criminals
All inside the walls
On the grounds of Red Wing

[Verse 2]
From the dirty old mess hall
You march to the brick wall
Too weary to talk
And too tired to sing
And it’s all afternoon
You remember your hometown
All inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing

[Verse 3]
Oh, the gates are cast iron
And the walls are barbed wire
Stay far from the fence
With the ’lectricity sting
And it’s keep down your head
And stay in your number
All inside the grounds of
The walls of Red Wing

[Verse 4]
Oh, it’s fare thee well
To the deep hollow dungeon
Farewell to the boardwalk
That takes you to the screen
And farewell to the minutes
They threaten you with it
All inside the grounds of
The walls of Red Wing

[Verse 5]
It’s many a guard
That stands around smiling
Holding his club
Like he was a king
Hoping to get you
Behind the wood piling
All inside the grounds of
The walls of Red Wing

[Verse 6]
The night aimed shadows
Through the crossbar windows
And the wind punched hard
To make the wall-siding sing
It’s many a night
I pretended to be a-sleeping
All inside the grounds of
The walls of Red Wing

[Verse 7]
As the rain rattled heavy
On the bunkhouse shingles
And the sounds of the night
They made my ears ring
Till the keys of the guards
Clicked the tune of the morning
All inside the grounds of
The walls of Red Wing

[Verse 8]
Oh, some of us’ll end up
In St. Cloud Prison
And some of us’ll end up
To be lawyers and things
And some of us’ll stand
To meet you on your crossroads
From inside the grounds of
The walls of Red Wing

[Chorus]
Trails of troubles
Roads of battles
Paths of victory
I shall walk

[Verse 1]
The trail is dusty
And my road it might be rough
But the better roads are waiting
And boys it ain’t far off

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I walked down by the river
I turned my head up high
I saw that silver linin’
That was hanging in the sky

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The evening dusk was rolling
I was walking down the track
There was a one-way wind a-blowin’
And it was blowin’ at my back

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
The gravel road is bumpy
It’s a hard road to ride
But there’s a clearer road a-waitin’
With the cinders on the side

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
That evening train was rolling
The humming of its wheels
My eyes they saw a better day
As I looked across the fields

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
The trail is dusty
The road it might be rough
But the good road is a-waiting
And boys it ain’t far off

[Chorus]
That puts me in a stupor,
Kinda like saying I wanna see the young you in the future
Scratch that, to deepen the absurdity,
Certainly to remain young in the face of getting old requires plastic surgery
And I've never been 1 to fake it and give you young shit from an old ass nigga with a facelift
I still hip so if it ain't break, don't replace it
These the complexes of a complex nigga in the face of criticism so basic
When your basics are the basic mathematics of spaceships
And if I do dumb it down for dumb niggas or younger crowds...to pay rent
An old man with younger styles on some Jay shit
My old fans run around and trash my latest efforts at making records as watered down so go old,
But forgetters that Food & Liquor didn't go Gold.
I mean G is G
I don't do this shit for free, always for some freedom,
But niggas got lawyer fees in that Windy City where rapping is a breeze
A Twis-ta nig-ga you-so...cra-zy,
Would I do when they want that young Lu?
"Nigga tell em time machine or Fuck-You, Pay-Me

[Verse 1]
Come and listen for a moment, lads
And hear me tell my tale
How across the sea from England
I was condemned to sail
Now the jury found me guilty
Then says the judge, says he
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you
Across the stormy sea
But take a tip before you ship
To join the iron gang
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay
Or else you'll surely hang
Or else you'll surely hang," says he
"And after that, Jim Jones
It's high above on the gallows tree
The crows will pick your bones."

[Verse 2]
And our ship was high upon the sea
Then pirates came along
But the soldiers on our convict ship
Were full five hundred strong
For they opened fire and somehow drove
That pirate ship away
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship
Than gone to Botany Bay
With the storms ragin' round us
And the winds a-blowin' gale
I'd rather have drowned in misery
Than gone to New South Wales

[Verse 3]
Now it's day and night and the irons clang
And like poor galley slaves
We toil and toil, and when we die
Must fill dishonored graves
And it's by and by I'll slip my chains
Well, into the bush I'll go
And I'll join the bush rangers there
Jack Donohue and co
And some dark night, when everything
Is silent in the town
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all
I'll gun the flogger down
Oh, I'll give the law
A little shock
Remember what I say
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones
In chains to Botany Bay

[Verse 1]
Black Jack Davey come a-riden' on back
A-whistling loud and merry
Made the woods around him ring
And he charmed the heart of a lady
Charmed the heart of a lady

[Verse 2]
"How old are you, my pretty little miss
How old are you, my honey"
She answered to him with a lovin' smile
"I'll be sixteen come Sunday
Be sixteen come Sunday."

[Verse 3]
"Come and go with me, my pretty little miss
Come and go with me, my honey
Take you where the grass grows green
You never will want for money
You never will want for money

[Chorus]
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes
All made of Spanish leather
Get behind me on my horse
And we'll ride off together
We'll both go off together."

Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes
Made of Spanish leather
Got behind him on his horse
And they rode off together
They rode off together

[Verse 4]
At night the boss came home
Inquiring about this lady
The servant spoke before she thought
"She's been with Black Jack Davey
Rode off with Black Jack Davey."

[Verse 5]
"Well, saddle for me my coal black stud
He's speedier than the gray
I rode all day and I'll ride all night
And I'll overtake my lady
I'll bring back my lady."

[Verse 6]
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight
Till he came to a river raging
And there he spied his darling bride
In the arms of Black Jack Davey
Wrapped up with Black Jack Davey

[Chorus]
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes
All made of Spanish leather
Get behind me on my horse
And we'll ride off together
We'll both go off together."

Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes
Made of Spanish leather
Got behind him on his horse
And they rode off together
They rode off together

[Verse 7]
"Would you forsake your house and home
Would you forsake your baby?
Would you forsake your husband, too
To go with Black Jack Davey
Rode off with Black Jack Davey?"

[Verse 8]
"Well, I'll forsake my house and home
And I'll forsake my baby
I'll forsake my husband, too
For the love of Black Jack Davey
Ride off with Black Jack Davey."

[Verse 9]
"Last night I slept in a feather bed
Between my husband and baby
Tonight I lay on the river banks
In the arms of Black Jack Davey
Love my Black Jack Davey."

[Verse 1]
Well, it's all of fair and handsome girl
She's all in her tender years
She fell in love with a sailor boy
It's true she loved him well
For to go off to sea with him
Like she did not know how
She longed to see that seaport town
Of Canadee-i-o

[Verse 2]
So she bargained with the sailor boy
All for a piece of gold
Straightaway then he led her
Down into the hold
Sayin', "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes
Your jacket shall be blue
You'll see that seaport town
Of Canadee-i-o

[Verse 3]
Now, when the other sailors heard the news
Well, they fell into a rage
And with all the ship's company
They were willing to engage
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys
Overboard we'll throw her
She'll never see that seaport town
Called Canadee-i-o

[Verse 4]
Now, when the captain he heard the news
Well, he too fell in a rage
And with the whole ship's company
He was willing to engage
Sayin', "She'll stay in sailor's clothes
Her color shall be blue
She'll see that seaport town
Call Canadee-i-o

[Verse 5]
Now, when they come down to Canada
Scarcely 'bout half a year
She's married this bold captain
Who called her his dear
She's dressed in silks and satins now
She cuts a gallant show
Finest of the ladies
Down Canadee-i-o

[Verse 6]
Come, all you fair and tender girls
Wheresoever you may be
I'd have you to follow your own true love
Whene'er he goes to sea
For if the sailors prove false to you
Well, the captain, he might prove true
You'll see the honor I have gained
By the wearing of the blue

[Verse 1]
Was in the summer
One early fall
Just tryin' to find my
Little all and all
Now she's gone
An' I don't worry
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world

[Verse 2]
Was in the spring
One summer's day
Just when she left me
She gone to stay
Now she's gone
An' I don't worry
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world

[Verse 3]
Now don't come running
Holding up your hand
Can get me a woman
Quick as you can get a man
Now she's gone
An' I don't worry
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world

[Verse 4]
Happen for days
Didn't know your name
Oh, why should I worry
Or crave you in vain?
Now she's gone
An' I don't worry
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world

[Verse 5]
Went to the station
Down in the yard
Gonna get me a freight train
Work's done got hard
Now she's gone
An' I don't worry
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world

[Verse 6]
The lonesome days
They have gone by
Why should I beg you?
You said good-bye
Now she's gone
An' I don't worry
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world

[Verse 1]
Oh, where is little Maggie
Over yonder she stands
Rifle on her shoulder
Six-shooter in her hand

[Verse 2]
How can I ever stand it
Just to see them two blue eyes
Shining like some diamonds
Like some diamonds in the sky

[Verse 3]
Rather be in some lonely hollow
Where the sun don't ever shine
Than to see you be another man's darling
And to know that you'll never be mine

[Verse 4]
Well, it's march me away to the station
With my suitcase in my hand
Yes, march me away to the station
I'm off to some far-distant land

[Verse 5]
Sometimes I have a nickel
And sometimes I have a dime
Sometimes I have ten dollars
Just to pay for little Maggie's wine

[Verse 6]
Pretty flowers are made for blooming
Pretty stars are made to shine
Pretty girls are made for boy's love
Little Maggie was made for mine

[Verse 7]
Well, yonder stands little Maggie
With a dram glass in her hand
She's a drinking down her troubles
Over courting some other man

[Chorus]
Who killed Davey Moore?
Why, and what’s the reason for?

[Verse 1]
“Not I,” says the referee
“Don’t point your finger at me
I could’ve stopped it in the eighth
And maybe kept him from his fate
But the crowd would’ve booed, I’m sure
At not getting their money’s worth
It’s too bad he had to go
But there was a pressure on me too, you know
It wasn’t me that made him fall
No, you can’t blame me at all”

[Chorus]
Who killed Davey Moore?
Why, and what’s the reason for?

[Verse 2]
“Not us,” says the angry crowd
Whose screams filled the arena loud
“It’s too bad he died that night
But we just like to see a fight
We didn’t mean for him to meet his death
We just meant to see some sweat
There is nothing wrong in that
It wasn’t us that made him fall
No, you can’t blame us at all”

[Chorus]
Who killed Davey Moore?
Why, and what’s the reason for?

[Verse 3]
“Not me,” says his manager
Puffing on a big cigar
“It’s hard to say, it’s hard to tell
I always thought that he was well
It’s too bad for his wife an’ kids he’s dead
But if he was sick, he should’ve said
It wasn’t me that made him fall
No, you can’t blame me at all”

[Chorus]
Who killed Davey Moore?
Why, and what’s the reason for?

[Verse 4]
“Not me,” says the gambling man
With his ticket stub still in his hand
“It wasn’t me that knocked him down
My hands never touched him none
I didn’t commit no ugly sin
Anyway, I put money on him to win
It wasn’t me that made him fall
No, you can’t blame me at all”

[Chorus]
Who killed Davey Moore?
Why, and what’s the reason for?

[Verse 5]
“Not me,” says the boxing writer
Pounding print on his old typewriter
Saying, “Boxing is not to blame
There’s just as much danger in a football game”
Saying, “Fist fighting is here to stay
It’s just the old American way
It wasn’t me that made him fall
No, you can’t blame me at all”

[Chorus]
Who killed Davey Moore?
Why, and what’s the reason for?

[Verse 6]
“Not me,” says the man whose fists
Laid him low in a cloud of mist
Who came here from Cuba’s door
Where boxing is not allowed no more
“I hit him, yes, it’s true
But that’s what I am paid to do
Don’t say ‘murder,’ don’t say ‘kill’
It was destiny, it was God’s will”

[Chorus]
Who killed Davey Moore?
Why, and what’s the reason for?

[Verse 1]
Got a little girl, little and low
She used to love me but she don't no more
She gotta step it up and go-Yeah, go
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go

[Verse 2]
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs
Make a living by putting on airs
Gotta step it up and go-Yeah, man
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go

[Verse 3]
Front door shut, back door too
Blinds pulled down, what' cha gonna do?
Gotta step it up and go-Yeah, go
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go

[Verse 4]
Got a little girl, her name is Ball
Give a little bit, she took it all
I said step it up and go-Yeah, man
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go

[Verse 5]
Me an' my baby walking down the street
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police
Gotta step it up and go-Yeah, go
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go

[Verse 6]
Tell my woman I'll see her at home
Ain't no lovin' since she been gone
Gotta step it up and go-Yeah, go
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go

[Verse 7]
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more
Hear my gal call me and I got to go
Step it up and go-Yeah, man
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go

[Verse 1]
Tomorrow night, will you remember what you said to night?
Tomorrow night, will all the thrill be gone?
Tomorrow night, will it be just another memory
Or just another song, that's in my heart to linger on?

[Verse 2]
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast
And you willingly surrender to me, my darling will it last?
Tomorrow night, will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Tomorrow night, will you say those lovely things you said tonight?

[Verse 3]
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast
And you willingly surrender to me, my darling will it last?
Tomorrow night, will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Tomorrow night, will you say those lovely things you said tonight?

[Verse 1]
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride
As we went a-walking down by the seaside
Now mark what followed and what did betide
For it being on Christmas morning

[Verse 2]
Now, for recreation, we went on a tramp
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
And a little wee drummer intending to camp
For the day being pleasant and charming

[Verse 3]
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant he cried
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply
Intending no harm but meant to pass by
For it being on Christmas morning

[Verse 4]
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist
Ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust
And drink the king's health in the morning

[Verse 5]
For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
And he always is blessed with a charming young wife
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife
And he always lives pleasant and charming

[Verse 6]
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean
And sup on thin gruel in the morning."

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 7]
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
For you've only the lend of them, as I suppose
But you dare not change them one night, for you know
If you do, you'll be flogged in the morning

[Verse 8]
And although that we're single and free
We take great delight in our own company
We have no desire strange places to see
Although that your offers are charming

[Verse 9]
And we have no desire to take your advance
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France
Where we would get shot without warning."

[Verse 10]
"Oh no," says the Sergeant. "I'll have no such chat
And neither will I take it from snappy young brats
For if you insult me with one other word
I'll cut off your heads in the morning."

[Verse 11]
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs
And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head
And bid them take that as fair warning

[Verse 12]
And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides
We flung them as far as we could in the tide
"Now take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride
"And temper their edge in the morning!"

[Verse 13]
And the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll
And bade it a tedious returning

[Verse 14]
And we having no money, paid them off in cracks
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks
And left them for dead in the morning

[Verse 15]
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts
And bid them look sharp in the morning

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 16]
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride
As we went a-walking down by the seaside
Now mark what followed and what did betide
For it being on Christmas morning

[Verse 1]
I've been a moonshiner
For seventeen long years
I've spent all my money
On whiskey and beer
I go to some hollow
And sit at my still
And if whiskey dont kill me
Then I dont know what will

[Verse 2]
I go to some bar room
And drink with my friends
Where the women can't follow
And see what I spend
God bless them pretty women
I wish they was mine
Their breath is as sweet
The dew on the vine

[Verse 3]
Let me eat when I am hungry
Let me drink when I am dry
A dollar when I am hard up
Religion when I die
The whole world's a bottle
And life's but a dram
When the bottle gets empty
It sure ain't worth a damn

[Chorus]
You're going to quit me, baby
Good as I been to you, Lawd, Lawd
Good as I been to you, Lawd, Lawd
Good as I been to you

[Verse 1]
Give you my money, honey
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lawd, Lawd

[Chorus]
You're going to quit me, baby
Good as I been to you, Lawd, Lawd
Good as I been to you, Lawd, Lawd
Good as I been to you

[Verse 2]
Six months on the chain gang
Believe me, it is no fun, Lawd, Lawd

[Chorus]
You're going to quit me, baby
Good as I been to you, Lawd, Lawd
Good as I been to you, Lawd, Lawd
Good as I been to you

[Verse 3]
Jailhouse is no plaything
Believe me, is no lie, Lawd, Lawd

[Chorus]
You're going to quit me, baby
Good as I been to you, Lawd, Lawd
Good as I been to you, Lawd, Lawd
Good as I been to you

[Verse 1]
Old Reilly stole a stallion
But they caught him and they brought him back
And they laid him down on the Jailhouse ground
With an iron chain around his neck

[Verse 2]
Old Reilly’s daughter got a message
That her father was going’ to hang
She rode by night and came by morning
With gold and silver in her hand

[Verse 3]
When the judge he saw Reilly’s daughter
His old eyes deepened in his head
Saying, “Gold will never free your father
The price, my dear, is you instead”

[Verse 4]
“Oh I’m as good as dead,” cried Reilly
“It’s only you that he does crave
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all
Get on your horse and ride away”

[Verse 5]
“Oh father you will surely die
If I don’t take the chance to try
And pay the price and not take your advice
For that reason I will have to stay”

[Verse 6]
The gallows shadows shook the evening
In the night a hound dog bayed
In the night the grounds were groaning
In the night the price was paid

[Verse 7]
The next morning she had awoken
To know that the judge had never spoken
She saw that hangin’ branch a-bendin’
She saw her father’s body broken

[Verse 8]
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel:
That one doctor will not save him
That two healers will not heal him
That three eyes will not see him

[Verse 9]
That four ears will not hear him
That five walls will not hide him
That six diggers will not bury him
And that seven deaths shall never kill him

[Verse 1]
I sang the song slowly
As she stood in the shadows
She stepped to the light
As my silver strings spun
She called with her eyes
To the tune I’s a-playing
But the song it was long
And I’d only begun

[Verse 2]
Through a bullet of light
Her face was reflecting
The fast fading words
That rolled from my tongue
With a long-distance look
Her eyes was on fire
But the song it was long
And there was more to be sung

[Verse 3]
My eyes danced a circle
Across her clear outline
With her head tilted sideways
She called me again
As the tune drifted out
She breathed hard through the echo
But the song it was long
And it was far to the end

[Verse 4]
I glanced at my guitar
And played it pretending
That of all the eyes out there
I could see none
As her thoughts pounded hard
Like the pierce of an arrow
But the song it was long
And it had to get done

[Verse 5]
As the tune finally folded
I laid down the guitar
Then looked for the girl
Who’d stayed for so long
But her shadow was missing
For all of my searching
So I picked up my guitar
And began the next song

[Verse 1]
Now There's a man you'll hear about
Most anywhere you go
And his holdings are in Texas
And his name is Diamond Joe

[Verse 2]
And he carries all his money
In a diamond-studded jar
He never took much trouble
With the process of the law

[Verse 3]
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys
Did offer him my hand
He gave me a string of horses
So old they could not stand

[Verse 4]
And I nearly starved to death, boys
He did mistreat me so
And I never saved a dollar
In the pay of Diamond Joe

[Verse 5]
Now his bread it was corn dodger
And his meat you couldn't chaw
Nearly drove me crazy
With the wagging of his jaw

[Verse 6]
And the telling of his story
Mean to let you know
That there never was a rounder
That could lie like Diamond Joe

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 7]
Now, I tried three times to quit him
But he did argue so
I'm still punching cattle
In the pay of Diamond Joe

[Verse 8]
And when I'm called up yonder
And it's my time to go
Give my blankets to my buddies
Give the fleas to Diamond Joe

[Verse 1]
I'm walking through streets that are dead
Walking, walking with you in my head
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired
And the clouds are weeping

[Verse 2]
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile
While I was sleeping

[Chorus]
I’m sick of love
But I'm in the thick of it
This kind of love
I'm so sick of it

[Verse 3]
I see, I see lovers in the meadow
I see, I see silhouettes in the window
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on
To a shadow

[Chorus]
I'm sick of love
I hear the clock tick
This kind of love
I'm lovesick

[Verse 4]
Sometimes the silence can be like the thunder
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder
Could you ever be true? I think of you
And I wonder

[Chorus]
I'm sick of love
I wish I'd never met you
I'm sick of love
I'm trying to forget you

[Outro]
Just don’t know what to do
I'd give anything to be with you

[Verse 1]
Strange things have happened, like never before
My baby told me I would have to go
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

[Verse 2]
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home
No use in worrying, 'cause the world gone wrong
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

[Verse 3]
I told you, baby, right to your head
If I didn't leave you I would have to kill you dead
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

[Verse 4]
I tried to be loving and treat you kind
But it seems like you never right, you got no loyal mind
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

[Verse 5]
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind
Praise the Good Lord to get her out of your mind
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

[Verse 6]
Said, when you been good now, can't do no more
Just tell her kindly, "there is the front door."
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

[Verse 7]
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

[Verse 1]
"Get down, get down, Love Henry," she cried
"And stay all night with me
I have gold chains, and the finest I have
I'll apply them all to thee."

[Verse 2]
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Or stay all night with thee
Some pretty little girl in Cornersville
I love far better than thee."

[Verse 3]
He layed his head on a pillow of down
Kisses she gave him three
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
She murdered mortal he

[Interlude]

[Verse 4]
"Get well, get well, Love Henry, " She cried
"Get well, get well," said she
"Oh don't you see my own heart's blood
Come flowin' down so free?"

[Verse 5]
She took him by his long yellow hair
And also by his feet
She plunged him into well water, where
It runs both cold and deep

[Verse 6]
"Lie there, lie there, Love Henry," she cried
"'Til the flesh rots off your bones
Some pretty little girl in Cornersville
Will mourn for your return."

[Interlude]

[Verse 7]
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried
"And light on my right knee
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
And hung on a willow tree."

[Verse 8]
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down
And light on your right knee
A girl who would murder her own true love
Would kill a little birdlike me."

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning, feeling blue
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
I got blood in my eyes for you, babe
I don't care what in the world you do

[Verse 2]
I went back home, put on my tie
Going to get that girl that money that money will buy
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
I got blood in my eyes for you, babe
I don't care what in the world you do

[Verse 3]
She looked at me, begin to smile
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
Got blood in my eyes for you, babe
I don't care what in the world you do

[Verse 4]
No, no, mama, I can't wait
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
I got blood in my eyes for you, babe
I don't care what in the world you do

[Verse 5]
I tell you something, tell you the facts
You don't want me, give my money back
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
I got blood in my eyes for you, babe
I don't care what in the world you do

[Intro]
Listen to me, baby
There’s something you must see
I want to be with you, gal
If you want to be with me

[Chorus]
But if you got to go
It’s all right
But if you got to go, go now
Or else you got to stay all night

[Verse 1]
It am not that I’m questioning you
To take part in any quiz
It’s just that I have got no watch
And you keep asking me what time it is

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I am just a poor boy, baby
Looking to connect
But I certainly don’t want you thinking
That I have not got any respect

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You know I’d have nightmares
And a guilty conscience, too
If I kept you from anything
That you really wanted to do

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
It ain't that I’m wanting
Anything you never gave before
It’s just that I’ll be sleeping soon
It’ll be too dark for you to find the door

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents
See my hound dog bite a rabbit
And my football’s sitting on a barbed-wire fence

[Verse 2]
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet don’t walk so fast
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet don’t walk so fast
Well, this Arabian doctor came in, gave me a shot
But wouldn’t tell me if what I had would last

[Verse 3]
Well, this woman I’ve got, she’s filling me with her drive
Yes, this woman I’ve got, she’s thrilling me with her hive
She’s calling me Stan
Or else she calls me Mister Clive

[Verse 4]
Of course, you’re gonna think this song is a riff
I know you’re gonna think this song is a cliff
Unless you’ve been inside a tunnel
And fell down 69, 70 feet over a barbed-wire fence

[Outro]
All night!

[Verse 1]
I see you in the lonely place
How can you be so blind
You still regretting the love you left, left behind
Oh darling, I seen you go through the changes
Sitting alone each night
Are you expecting to find the love, love that's right

[Hook]
Darling open your eyes
Let me show you light
Girl you never find a love that's right
Darling open your eyes
Let me show you the light
Girl you think you're so wise, you're so wise

[Verse 2]
There are times when you need someone
I will be by your side
I'll take my chances before they pass, pass me by
Oh darling, there is a light that shines
Special for you and me
You need to look at the other side, you'll agree

[Outro]
Darling open your eyes
Let me show you light
Girl you never find a love that's right
Darling open your eyes
Let me show you light
You may never find a love that's right
Darling open your eyes
Let me show you light
You may never find a love that's right
Darling open your eyes
Let me show you the light
Girl you think you're so wise
You may never find a love that's right

[Verse 1]
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drivin' wheel
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drivin' wheel
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels

[Verse 2]
Been shooting craps and gambling, momma, and I done got broke
Been shooting craps and gambling, momma, and I done got broke
I done pawned my pistol, baby, my best clothes been sold

[Chorus]
Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lord
Lordy, Lord

[Verse 3]
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knees
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knees
I ain't cryin' for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please

[Verse 4]
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more
Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Can't you hear me, baby, rappin' on your door?
Can't you hear me, baby, rappin' on your door?
Now you hear me tappin', tappin' across your floor

[Verse 6]
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all
What make me love my woman, she can really do the Georgia Crawl

[Verse 7]
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell
If you're a real hot momma, come take away Daddy's weeping spell

[Verse 1]
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down
All the friends I ever had are gone

[Verse 2]
Delia's dear ol' mother took a trip out West
When she returned, little Delia gone to rest
All the friends I ever had are gone

[Verse 3]
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's momma moaned
Wouldn't have been so bad if the poor girl died at home
All the friends I ever had are gone

[Verse 4]
Curtis' looking high, Curtis' looking low
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel forty-four
All the friends I ever had are gone

[Verse 5]
High up on the housetops, high as I can see
Looking for them rounders, looking out for me
All the friends I ever had are gone

[Verse 6]
Men in Atlanta, tryin' to pass for white
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet out of sight
All the friends I ever had are gone

[Verse 7]
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
"All about them rounders, Judge, tryin' to cut me out."
All the friends I ever had are gone

[Verse 8]
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
All the friends I ever had are gone

[Verse 9]
Curtis' in the jail house, drinking from an old tin cup
Delia's in the graveyard, she ain't gettin' up
All the friends I ever had are gone

[Verse 10]
Delia, oh Delia, how can it be?
You loved all them rounders, never did love me
All the friends I ever had are gone

[Seal]
Come sweetly, stab me through the shadow of an open door
Wait quietly now, take us to the helplessness of it all
And I wonder as I watch you slip away somehow
Wonder if the only thing left is love
Wonder if I ever will wait

[Hook]
Will I ever love again?
Will I ever love again?

[John Legend]
Oh, lie to me
Lie to me, tell me I'm not wasting time
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, convince me you miss me
Your heart still beats as fast as mine
Tell me lies
We loved it, loved it even more than we knew
We lost it, and I don't even know what to do
Tell me what to do
Cause I wonder why it had to slip away somehow
I wonder if you'll ever wanna see me now
I wonder if I'll ever be the same

[Hook]
Will I ever love again?
Will I ever love again?

[Bridge]
Oh, you eyes haunt me, taunt me, pierce straight through my heart again
Will it ever end?
Cause I

[Seal + John Legend]
Wonder as I watch you slip away somehow
I wonder if you ever wanna see me now
I wonder if I'll ever wait

[Hook]
Will I ever love again?
Will I ever love again?

[Verse 1]
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
You've got my head spinnin', no kiddin'
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around
Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's under water, but I'm breathin' fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

[Bridge]
Give me all of you, oh
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

[Outro]
I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night
Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight
All about that John B. Stetson hat

[Verse 2]
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room, and he called for a glass of beer
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doin' here?"
"Waitin' for a train, please bring my woman home

[Verse 3]
"Stack-A-Lee, oh Stack-A-Lee. please don't take my life
Got three little children and a-weepin', lovin' wife
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."

[Verse 4]
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
All about that John B. Stetson hat

[Verse 5]
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead
All about that John B. Stetson hat

[Verse 6]
Sent for the doctor, well the doctor he did come
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?"
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."

[Verse 7]
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Taking him to the cemetery, buy they failed to bring him back
All about that John B. Stetson hat

[Verse 8]
Hawlin Alley, thought I heard the bulldogs bark
It must have been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail

[Verse 9]
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, and he jumped forty feet
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail

[Verse 10]
Well they got old Stack-A-Lee and they laid him right back in jail
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail
All about that John B. Stetson hat

[Verse 11]
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons began to creep."
All about that John B. Stetson hat

[Intro]
I... Yeah

[Verse 1]
You fix your make-up, just so
Guess you don't know, that you're beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes a half hour ago

[Pre-Chrous]
And if your mirror won't make it any clearer
I'll be the one to let you know

[Chrous]
Out of all the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars
You make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you

[Verse 2]
You stop the room when we walk in
The spotlight's on, everybody's staring
Tell all of these boys they're wasting their time
Stop standing in line, 'cause you're all mine

[Pre-Chrous]
And this evening I won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side

[Chrous]
Out of all the girls
You’re my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars
You make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world

[Bridge]
You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try
Oh, you don't have to try
Don't try, don't try
You don't have to try

[Chrous]
Oh, out of all the girls
You’re my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars
They don't shine brighter than you are
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
You and I

[Outro]
Nobody in the world tonight
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I

[Verse 1]
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy
His voice was low with pain
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine
If I ride back again
But if you ride back and I am left
You'll do as much for me
Mother, you know, must hear the news
So write to her tenderly

[Verse 2]
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint
Her fond face pale with woe
Her heart will be broken when I am gone
I'll see her soon, I know."
Just then the order came to charge
For an instance hand touched hand
They said, "Aye," and away they rode
That brave and devoted band

[Verse 3]
Straight was the track to the top of the hill
The rebels they shot and shelled
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
And guarded them as they fell
There soon came a horrible dying yell
From heights that they could not gain
And those whom doom and death had spared
Rode slowly back again

[Verse 4]
But among the dead that were left on the hill
Was the boy with the curly hair
The tall dark man who rode by his side
Lay dead beside him there
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
The words that her lover had said
Momma, you know, awaits the news
And she'll only know he's dead

[Verse 1]
The pawnbroker roared
Also, so, so did the landlord
The scene was so crazy, wasn’t it?
Both were so glad
To watch me destroy what I had
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn’t it?
Why didn’t you just leave me if you didn’t want to stay?
Why’d you have to treat me so bad?
Did it have to be that way?
Now you stand here expectin’ me to remember something’ you forgot to say
Yes, and you, I see you’re still with her, well
That’s fine ’cause she’s comin’ on so strange, can’t you tell?
Somebody had better explain
She’s got her iron chain
I’d do it, but I, I just can’t remember how
You talk to her
She’s your lover now

[Verse 2]
I already assumed
That we’re in the felony room
But I ain’t a judge, you don’t have to be nice to me
But please tell that
To your friend in the cowboy hat
You know he keeps on saying’ everything’ twice to me
You know I was straight with you
You know I’ve never tried to change you in any way
You know if you didn’t want to be with me
That you could, didn’t have to stay
Now you stand here sayin’ you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Yes, you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays, can’t you reach?
I see you kiss her on the cheek ev’rytime she gives a speech
With her picture books of the pyramid
And her postcards of Billy the Kid (why must everybody bow?)
You better talk to her ’bout it
You’re her lover now

[Verse 3]
Oh, everybody that cares
Is going up the castle stairs
But I’m not up in your castle, honey
It’s true, I just can’t recall
San Francisco at all
I can’t even remember El Paso, uh, honey
You never had to be faithful
I never wanted you to grieve
Oh, why was it so hard for you
If you didn’t want to be with me, just to leave?
Now you stand here while your finger’s going’ up my sleeve
An’ you, just what do you do anyway?
Ain’t there nothing’ you can say?
She’ll be standing’ on the bar soon
With a fish head and a harpoon
And a fake beard plastered on her brow
You’d better do something quick
She’s your lover now

[Verse 4]
Oh, why must I fall into this sadness?
Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Do you think I still got what you still got baby?
My voice is really warm
It's just there, it ain't got no form
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby
Ah, your mouth used to be so naked
Your eyes used to be so blue
Your hurts used to be so nameless
And your tears used to be so few
Now your mouth cries wolf
While... (What?)

[Verse 1]
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe
My woman needs it everyday
She promised this a-lad she’d stay
She’s rolling up a lotta bread to toss away

[Verse 2]
She’s in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe
Now she’s opened up an old maid’s home
She’s proud, but she needs to roam
She’s gonna write herself a roadside poem about Santa Fe

[Verse 3]
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe
Since I’m never gonna cease to roam
I’m never, ever far from home
But I’ll build a geodesic dome and sail away

[Verse 4]
Don’t feel bad, no, no, no, no, don’t feel bad
It’s the best food I’ve ever had
Makes me feel so glad
That she’s cooking in a homemade pad
She never caught a cold so bad when I’m away

[Verse 4]
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe
My shrimp boat’s in the bay
I won’t have my nature this way
And I’m leaning on the wheel each day to drift away from

[Verse 5]
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe
My sister looks good at home
She’s licking on an ice cream cone
She’s packin’ her big white comb
What does it weigh?
Barbershop flow call me Sweeny Todd
Hi girls lemme snip them bikinis off
Sorry, I can get little dumb after a blunts rolled
Calm down while I put this dick in your bum whole

[Chorus]
Wallflower, wallflower
Won’t you dance with me?
I’m sad and lonely too
Wallflower, wallflower
Won’t you dance with me?
I’m feeling’ in love with you

[Bridge]
Just like you, I’m wondering what I’m doing here
Just like you, I’m wondering what’s going on

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
And I know that you’re gonna be mine one of these days
Mine alone

[Chorus]

[Intro]
There’s nothing ’round here I believe in
’Cept you, yeah you
And there’s nothing to me that’s sacred
’Cept you, yeah you

[Verse 1]
You’re the one that reaches me
You’re the one that I admire
Every time we meet together
My soul feels like it’s on fire
Nothing matters to me
And there’s nothing I desire
’Cept you, yeah you

[Verse 2]
Nothing ’round here I care to try for
’Cept you, yeah you
Got nothing left to live or die for
’Cept you, yeah you

[Verse 3]
There’s a hymn I used to hear
In the churches all the time
Make me feel so good inside
So peaceful, so sublime
And there’s nothing to remind me of that
Old familiar chime
’Cept you, uh huh you

[Verse 4]
Used to play in the cemetery
Dance and sing and run when I was a child
Never seemed strange
But now I just pass mournfully by
That place where the bones of life are piled
I know something’ has changed
I’m a stranger here and no one sees me
’Cept you, yeah you

[Verse 5]
Nothing much matters or seems to please me
’Cept you, yeah you
Nothing hypnotizes me
Or holds me in a spell
Everything runs by me
Just like water from a well
Everybody wants my attention
Everybody’s got something to sell
’Cept you, yeah you

[Verse 1]
Well, I walked all night long
Hearin' them church bells tone
Yes, I walked all night long
Listen to them church bells tone
Either someone needing mercy
Or might be somethin' I've done wrong

[Verse 2]
Well, your friends come by for you
I don't know what to say
Well, your friends come by for you
I don't know what to say
I just can't face to tell 'em
Honey, you just went away

[Verse 3]
The children cry for mother
I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip"
Well, the children cry for mother
I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip"
Well, I walk on pins and needles
I hope my tongue don't slip

[Verse 4]
Well, I gaze at passing strangers
In case I might see you
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers
In case I might see you
But the sun goes around the heavens
And another day just drives on through

[Verse 5]
Way out in the distance
I know you're with some other man
Way out in the distance
I know you're with some other man
But that's alright, baby
You know I always understand

[Verse 6]
Call girls in the doorway
All givin' me the eye
Call girls in the doorway
All givin' me the eye
But my heart's just not in it
I might as well pass right on by

[Verse 7]
My ears are ringin'
Ringin' like empty shells
My ears are ringin'
Ringin' like empty shells
Well, it can't be no guitar player
It must be combat bells

[Verse 1]
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
And then I turn my head, for you’re approaching me
Moonlight on the water, fisherman’s daughter, floating in to my room
With a golden loom

[Verse 2]
First we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
And then the tears roll down, what a bitter taste
And then you drift away on a summer’s day where the wildflowers bloom
With your golden loom

[Verse 3]
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night
I see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil
But you’re gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
And your golden loom

[Verse 1]
Lazy stadium night
Catfish on the mound
“Strike three,” the umpire said
Batter have to go back and sit down

[Chorus]
Catfish, million-dollar-man
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can

[Verse 2]
Used to work on Mr. Finley’s farm
But the old man wouldn’t pay
So he packed his glove and took his arm
And one day he just ran away

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Come up where the Yankees are
Dress up in a pinstripe suit
Smoke a custom-made cigar
Wear an alligator boot

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Carolina born and bred
Love to hunt the little quail
Got a hundred-acre spread
Got some huntin’ dogs for sale

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Reggie Jackson at the plate
Seeing’ nothing’ but the curve
Swing too early or too late
Got to eat what Catfish serve

[Chorus]

[6Verse ]
Even Billy Martin grins
When the Fish is in the game
Every season twenty wins
Gonna make the Hall of Fame

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Seven days, seven more days she’ll be coming
I’ll be waiting at the station for her to arrive
Seven more days, all I gotta do is survive

[Verse 1]
She been gone ever since I been a child
Ever since I seen her smile, I ain’t forgotten her eyes
She had a face that could outshine the sun in the skies

I been good, I been good while I been waiting
Maybe guilty of hesitating, I just been holding on
Seven more days, all that’ll be gone

[Chorus]
There’s kissing in the valley
Thieving in the alley
Fighting every inch of the way
Trying to be tender
With somebody I remember
In a night that’s always brighter’n the day

[Verse 2]
Seven days, seven more days that are connected
Just like I expected, she’ll be coming on forth
My beautiful comrade from the north

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
You harbor resentment
You know there ain’t too much of a thrill
You wish for contentment
But you got an emptiness that can’t be filled
You’ve had enough of hatred
Your bones are breaking, can’t find nothing sacred

[Chorus]
Ye shall be changed, ye shall be changed
In a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
And ye shall be changed

[Verse 2]
Everything you’ve gotten
You’ve gotten by sweat, blood and muscle
From early in the morning ’till way past dark
All you ever do is hustle
All your loved ones have walked out the door
You’re not even sure ’bout your wife and kids no more, but

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The past don’t control you
But the future’s like a roulette wheel spinning
Deep down inside
You know you need a whole new beginning
Don’t have to go to Russia or Iran
Just surrender to God and He’ll move you right here where you stand, and

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
You drink bitter water
And you been eating the bread of sorrow
You can’t live for today
When all you’re ever thinking of is tomorrow
The path you’ve endured has been rough
When you’ve decided that you’ve had enough, then

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
Singing about conspiracy, wanted me to be afraid
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust
Suffered ridicule and wanting to give it all up in disgust

[Chorus]
But you changed my life
Came along in a time of strife
In hunger and need, you made my heart bleed
You changed my life

[Verse 2]
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end

[Chorus]
But you changed my life
Came along in a time of strife
In hunger and need, you made my heart bleed
You changed my life

[Verse 3]
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal
I do it myself, it's not so unreal
The call of the wild is forever at my door
Wants me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor

[Chorus]
But you changed my life
Came along in a time of strife
In hunger and need, you made my heart bleed
You changed my life

[Verse 4]
I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray
I was told i was looking good and to have a nice day
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite
Eating that absolute garbage while being so discreet

[Chorus]
But you changed my life
Came along in a time of strife
In hunger and need, you made my heart bleed
You changed my life

[Verse 5]
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm
While orphans of man danced to the beat of the palm
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass
In the world you had made they made you an outcast

[Chorus]
But you changed my life
Came along in a time of strife
In hunger and need, you made my heart bleed
You changed my life

[Verse 6]
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
Invading my privacy making my decisions for me
Holding me back, not letting me stand
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land

[Chorus]
But you changed my life
Came along in a time of strife
In hunger and need, you made my heart bleed
You changed my life

[Verse 7]
My Lord and my Savior, my companion, my friend
Heart fixer, mind regulator, true to the end
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy
What the world is set against but will never destroy

[Chorus]
But you changed my life
Came along in a time of strife
In hunger and need, you made my heart bleed
You changed my life

[Bridge - Lil Wayne]
So you didn't get drafted by the NBA, but you got drafted to defend your U.S.A
Now you got war on your mind, put you on front line and you will die, die, the American way

[Verse 1 - Gudda Gudda]
So I woke up at the crack of dawn, a lot going through my mind while I stretch and yawn
Its a love-hate thing, but my heart is torn, man, let me just speak about whats going on
Hey, Dear Mr. President, why you got our troops in the war and they fighting over shit thats irrelevant
While the crime rates spread like an infection, Im trying to duck jail and a lethal injection

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
Love, hate, size, race, crime, grace, lip injection, lethal injection
Breast reduction, police corruption, your assumption, economical destruction
Breast reduction, police corruption, your assumption, economical destruction
Love, hate, size, race, crime, grace, crime rate, lip injection, lethal injection
Lip injection, lethal injection, breast reduction, police corruption
Your assumption, economical destruction, breast reduction
Police corruption, your assumption, economical destruction

[Lil Wayne Scream]

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
What is your fucking problem, I'm from the fucking bottom
I got a bunch of problems, and can't nothing solve them
My room is full of demons, I ain't afraid of them
I hear them witches screaming, I raise a blade to them

[Hook - Lil Wayne]

[Bridge - Lil Wayne]

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
Question, what the fuck is you go do, when that new world come for you
When that new world come for you, revolution is never the solution
Prostitution, drug distribution, war contribution, all for the love of the constitution
Yeah

[Hook - Lil Wayne & Gudda Gudda]
Love, hate, size, race, grime, grace, lip injection, lethal injection
While the crime rates spread like an infection, Im trying to duck jail and a lethal injection
Love, hate, size, race, grime, grace, crime rate, lip injection, lethal injection
Lip injection, lethal injection, breast reduction, police corruption, your assumption
Economical destruction, breast reduction, police corruption, your assumption, economical destruction

[Verse 1]
Well, my heart’s in the Highlands gentle and fair
Honeysuckle bloomin' in the Wildwood air
Bluebells blazin' where the Aberdeen waters flow
Well my heart’s in the Highlands
I’m gonna go there when I feel good enough to go

[Verse 2]
Windows was shakin’ all night in my dreams
Everything was exactly the way that it seems
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page
Same ol’ rat race
Life in the same ol’ cage

[Verse 3]
I don’t want nothin' from anyone, ain’t that much to take
Wouldn’t know the difference between a real blonde and a fake
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery
I wish someone would come
And push back the clock for me

[Verse 4]
Well my heart’s in the Highlands wherever I roam
That’s where I’ll be when I get called home
The wind, it whispers to the buckeyed trees in rhyme
Well my heart’s in the Highlands
I can only get there one step at a time

[Verse 5]
I’m listenin' to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound
Someone’s always yellin' turn it down
Feel like I’m drifting
Drifting from scene to scene
I’m wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean?

[Verse 6]
Insanity is smashin' up against my soul
You could say I was on anything but a roll
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top
What would I do with it anyway?
Maybe take it to the pawn shop

[Verse 7]
My heart’s in the Highlands at the break of dawn
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan
Big white clouds like chariots that swing down low
Well my heart’s in the Highlands
Only place left to go

[Verse 8]
I’m in Boston town, in some restaurant
I got no idea what I want
Or maybe I do but I’m just really not sure
Waitress comes over
Nobody in the place but me and her

[Verse 9]
Well, it must be a holiday, there’s nobody around
She studies me closely as I sit down
She got a pretty face and long white shiny legs
I said "Tell me what I want"
She say, “You probably want hard boiled eggs”

[Verse 10]
I say "That's right: bring me some"
She says "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come”
Then she says, “I know you’re an artist, draw a picture of me”
I said, “I would if I could, but
I don’t do sketches from memory”

[Verse 11]
“Well,” she says, “I’m right here in front of you, or haven’t you looked?”
I say, “All right, I know, but I don’t have my drawing book”
She gives me a napkin, she say, “You can do it on that”
I say, “Yes I could, but
I don’t know where my pencil is at”

[Verse 12]
She pulls one out from behind her ear
She says, “All right now, go ahead, draw me, I’m standing right here”
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see
Well she takes the napkin and throws it back
And says, “That don’t look a thing like me”

[Verse 13]
I said, “Oh, kind Miss, it most certainly does”
She says, “You must be jokin',” I say, “I wish I was”
Then she says, “You don’t read women authors, do you?”
At least that’s what I think I hear her say
“Well,” I say, “how would you know? And what would it matter anyway?”

[Verse 14]
“Well,” she says, “you just don’t seem like you do”
I said, “You’re way wrong”
She says, “Which ones have you read then?” I say, “I read Erica Jong!”
She goes away for a minute
And I slide up out of my chair
I step outside back to the busy street but nobody’s going anywhere

[Verse 15]
Well, my heart’s in the Highlands with the horses and hounds
Way up in the border country, far from the towns
With the twang of the arrow and a snap of the bow
My heart’s in the Highlands
Can’t see any other way to go

[Verse 16]
Every day is the same thing out the door
Feel further away than ever before
Some things in life, it gets too late to learn
Well, I’m lost somewhere
I must have made a few bad turns

[Verse 17]
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes
They’re drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes
All the young men with their young women looking so good
Well, I’d trade places with any of them
In a minute, if I could

[Verse 18]
I’m crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog
Talking to myself in a monologue
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat
Somebody just asked me
If I registered to vote

[Verse 19]
The sun is beginning to shine on me
But it’s not like the sun that used to be
The party’s over and there’s less and less to say
I got new eyes
Everything looks far away

[Verse 20]
Well, my heart’s in the Highlands at the break of day
Over the hills and far away
There’s a way to get there and I’ll figure it out somehow
But I’m already there in my mind
And that’s good enough for now

[Verse 1]
For his age, he’s wise
He’s got his mother’s eyes
There’s gladness in his heart
He’s young and he’s wild
My only prayer is, if I can’t be there
Lord, protect my child

[Verse 2]
As his youth now unfolds
He is centuries old
Just to see him at play makes me smile
No matter what happens to me
No matter what my destiny
Lord, protect my child

[Verse 3]
The whole world is asleep
You can look at it and weep
Few things you find are worthwhile
And though I don’t ask for much
No material things to touch
Lord, protect my child

[Verse 4]
He’s young and on fire
Full of hope and desire
In a world that’s been raped and defiled
If I fall along the way
And can’t see another day
Lord, protect my child

[Verse 5]
There’ll be a time I hear tell
When all will be well
When God and man will be reconciled
But until men lose their chains
And righteousness reigns
Lord, protect my child

[Verse 1]
Lately I've been having evil dreams
I wake up in a cold blue glare
I run the tape back in my mind
Wonder if I took the wrong road somewhere
Searching for the truth the way God designed it
Well the real truth is that I might be afraid to find it

[Chorus]
Well, I need a woman, alright
Need a woman, every night
To be with me and know me as I am
Show me the kind of love that don't have to be condemned
And I want you to be that woman every day
Be that woman every way

[Verse 2]
Well I've had my eyes on you baby for five long years
Well you probably don't know me at all
But I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears
A tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near
There's always some new stranger in the night
To lend a sympathetic ear

[Chorus]
Well I need a woman to be my own
I need a woman that's mine alone
Seen you in the doorway, I seen you in the park
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark
And I want you to be that woman oh oh oh
Be that woman every way

[Verse 3]
You keep listening to something long enough
You just bound to believe that it's true
You know there's some things that you put out
It's gonna come back on you
That which is not permanent don't last
Whatever's waiting in the future
Could be what you're running from in the past

[Chorus]
Well I need a woman, oh pull up
Need a woman, drinking from the same cup
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend
Someone who don't make herself up to make every man her friend
And I want you to be that woman every day
Be that woman every way

[Verse 4]
Don't know what you got that I want
Don't know what I got to give
Don't know how much time I've got
Don't know how long I'll live
The rebellion in my soul, why was it created?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep me isolated

[Chorus]
But I need a woman, she ain't no crime
Need a woman, all the time
To see the promised land with me as the time goes by
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high
And I want you to be that woman, yes I do
Be that woman straight and true

[Verse 1]
Well, it’s always been my nature to take chances
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances
To the tune of a concertina

[Verse 2]
Blood dryin’ in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door
But whatever could it be, makes you think you’ve seen me before
Angelina

[Chorus]
Oh, Angelina
Oh, Angelina

[Verse 3]
His eyes were two slits make any snake proud
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Worshipping a god with the body of a woman well endowed
And the head of a hyena

[Verse 4]
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek
Angelina

[Chorus]
Oh, Angelina
Oh, Angelina

[Verse 5]
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode
The peaches they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road
With your subpoena

[Verse 6]
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame
I’ve tried my best to love you but I cannot play this game
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same
Angelina

[Chorus]
Oh, Angelina
Oh, Angelina

[Verse 7]
There’s a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone
Your servants are half dead, you’re down to the bone
Tell me, tall men, where would you like to be overthrown
Maybe down in Jerusalem or Argentina?

[Verse 8]
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold
He’s surrounded by God’s angels and she’s wearing’ a blindfold
And so are you, Angelina

[Chorus]
Oh, Angelina
Oh, Angelina

[Verse 9]
I see pieces of men marching; trying to take heaven by force
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse
In God’s truth tell me what you want and you’ll have it of course
Just step into the arena

[Verse 10]
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases
Pass the tree of smoke, pass the angel with four faces
Begging God for mercy and weeping’ in unholy places
Angelina

[Chorus]
Oh, Angelina
Oh, Angelina

[Verse 1]
They say, “Eat, drink and be merry
Take the bull by the horns”
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns
Everything looks a little far away to me

[Verse 2]
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap
Too much information about nothing
Too much educated rap
It’s just like you told me, just like you said it would be

[Verse 3]
The moon rising like wildfire
I feel the breath of a storm
Something I got to do tonight
You go inside and stay warm

[Chorus]
Someone’s got a hold of my heart
Someone’s got a hold of my heart
Someone’s got a hold of my heart
You
Yeah, you got a hold of my heart

[Verse 4]
Just got back from a city of flaming red skies
Everybody thinks with their stomach
There’s plenty of spies
Every street is crooked, they just wind around till they disappear

[Verse 5]
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Like an ancient river
So wide and deep
She said, “Be easy, baby, ain’t nothin’ worth stealing in here”

[Verse 6]
You’re the one I’ve been waiting for
You’re the one I desire
But you must first realize
I’m not another man for hire

[Chorus]

[Verse 7]
I can hear that hot-blooded singer
On the bandstand croon
Poisoned Love, Red Roses for a Blue Lady and Memphis in June
While they’re beating the devil out of a guy who’s wearing a powder blue wig

[Verse 8]
I been to Babylon
I gotta confess
I could still hear the voice crying in the wilderness
What looks large from a distance, close up is never that big
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Tell me--I’ve got to know
Tell me--tell me before I go
Does that flame still burn, Does that fire still glow
Or has it died out and melted like the snow
Tell me
Tell me

[Verse 2]
Tell me--what are you focused upon
Tell me--will it come to me after you're gone
Tell me quick with a glance or a sigh
Shall I hold you close or  let you go by
Tell me
Tell me

[Verse 3]
Is that the heat and the beat of your pulse that I feel
If it's not that then what are you tryin' to conceal
Do you have any secrets
That will only come out in time
Do you lay in your bed
Do you stare at the stars
Is your main friend someone who’s an old acquaintance of ours
Tell me
Tell me

[Verse 4]
Tell me--are those rock'n'roll dreams in your eyes
Tell me--behind what door your treasure lies
Ever gone broke in a big way
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say
Tell me
Tell me

[Verse 5]
Is this some kind of game that you’re playing’ with my heart
How deep must I go? When do I start?
Do you have any morals
Do you have any point of view
Is that a smile that I see on your face
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace
Tell me
Tell me

[Verse 6]
Tell me--is that man's name in your book
Tell me--will you go back and take another look
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies
Are you anybody's someone prays for or cries
Tell me
Tell me

[Verse 1]
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male
They sang “Danny Boy” at his funeral and the Lord’s Prayer
Preacher talking ’bout Christ betrayed
It’s like the earth just opened and swallowed him up
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up
Sooner or later you gonna meet them coming down

[Chorus]
Well, there ain’t no goin’ back
When your foot of pride come down
Ain’t no goin’ back

[Verse 2]
Hear ya got a brother named James, don’t forget faces or names
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed
He looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine
But he drinks, and drinks can be fixed
Sing me one more song, about ya love me to the moon and the stranger
And your fall-by-the sword love affair with Errol Flynn
In these times of compassion when conformity’s in fashion
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in

[Chorus]
Well, there ain’t no goin’ back
When your foot of pride come down
Ain’t no goin’ back

[Verse 3]
There’s a retired businessman named Red
Cast down from heaven and he’s out of his head
He feeds off of everyone that he can touch
He said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash
He’s not somebody that you play around with much
Miss Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is
She’ll do wondrous works with your fate
Feed you coconut bread
Spice buns in your bed
If you don’t mind sleeping with your head face down in a grave

[Chorus]
Well, there ain’t no goin’ back
When your foot of pride come down
Ain’t no goin’ back

[Verse 4]
Well, they’ll choose a man for you to meet tonight
You’ll play the fool and learn how to walk through the doors
How to enter into the gates of paradise
No, how to carry a burden too heavy to be yours
Yeah, from the stage they’ll be trying’ to get water out rocks
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in
Sing “Amazing Grace” all the way to the Swiss banks

[Chorus]
Well, there ain’t no goin’ back
When your foot of pride come down
Ain’t no goin’ back

[Verse 5]
They got some beautiful people out there, man
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue
They got mystery written all over their forehead
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young
They don’t believe in mercy
Judgement on them is something that you’ll never see
They can exalt you up or bring you down main route
Turn you into anything that they want you to be

[Chorus]
Well, there ain’t no goin’ back
When your foot of pride come down
Ain’t no goin’ back

[Verse 6]
Yes, I guess I loved him too
I can still see him in my mind climbin’ that hill
Did he make it to the top, well he probably did and dropped
Struck down by the strength of the will
Ain’t nothin’ left here partner, just the dust of a plague
That has left this whole town afraid
From now on, this’ll be where you’re from
Let the dead bury the dead. Your time will come
Let hot iron blow as he raised the shade

[Chorus]
Well, there ain’t no goin’ back
When your foot of pride come down
Ain’t no goin’ back

[Verse 1]
I was thinking of a series of dreams
Where nothing comes up to the top
Everything stays down where it’s wounded
And comes to a permanent stop
Wasn’t thinking of anything specific
Like in a dream, when someone wakes up and screams
Nothing too very scientific
Just thinking of a series of dreams

[Verse 2]
Thinking of a series of dreams
Where the time and the tempo fly
And there’s no exit in any direction
’Cept the one that you can’t see with your eyes
Wasn’t making any great connection
Wasn’t falling for any intricate scheme
Nothing that would pass inspection
Just thinking of a series of dreams

[Bridge]
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Into the path you are hurled
And the cards are no good that you’re holding
Unless they’re from another world

[Verse 3]
In one, numbers were burning
In another, I witnessed a crime
In one, I was running, and in another
All I seemed to be doing was climb
Wasn’t looking for any special assistance
Not going to any great extremes
I’d already gone the distance
Just thinking of a series of dreams

[Introduction: Amy Wallace]
Yes, he made the album of 2012. (Just ask him, he'll tell you.) But that was just the second biggest moment of Frank Ocean's year. Here, while wearing the sport coats of the season and surrounded by his whole Odd Future crew, the ascendant singer opens up to Amy Wallace about his crazy year—including the bomb he dropped on the hip-hop world.

If Frank Ocean wanted to play you a song, you'd drive across town in the pouring rain, right? That's how we've ended up at Jungle City, a sound studio in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. When we walk in, Ocean leading the way, Pharrell Williams turns down the music and greets him warmly. "Here you are," the prolific rapper and producer tells him. "You've walked in at the right time."

"Sweet," Ocean replies, picking up Pharrell's diamond-studded gold chain that sits—fat as a tow rope—at the edge of the mixing board. Ocean, dressed in a gray Supreme hoodie, jeans, and black Wallabees, smiles as he dons the weighty necklace—it jibes with the new Rolex on his left wrist, the Cartier Juste Un Clou bracelet on his right. In a bit, he'll Instagram a bejeweled portrait of himself, but first he unveils three new tracks, stored on his phone, that Pharrell pronounces "crazy, with a lot of comprehensive layers just sort of living harmoniously." When Ocean says he worries a rap number called "Blue Whale" is "risky because I'm rhyming," Pharrell shakes his head.

"That's not risky. That thought is dead," he says. "It's like, 'You know, I rhyme, too.' "

Turning to me, Pharrell says, "I always call him James Taylor. He's probably the closest thing to a writer's perfect exemplification of the unconscious. All the songs are like movies. All you need to do is close your eyes."

Now it's Pharrell's turn to spin a track-in-progress. They listen, bobbing their heads slightly, occasionally both bursting into song. When the room is quiet again, Ocean says the song "feels like a Rubik's Cube melodically. You want something emotionally rich on that, you know what I'm saying? But if I listen to it enough, I could map a way out." Before we exit, they agree Ocean will come back later this evening to work on it. Pharrell is attending the first show of Jay-Z's eight-night run at the brand-new Barclays Center in Brooklyn, but he says he'll come back, too. "Ain't no afterparty more important than this."

"Map a way out"—it's a phrase Ocean will use more than once during the next four hours as we talk about his life and especially his last few months. He's still just 25, but it feels like he packed ten years' worth of living into 2012 alone, releasing a heralded album, Channel Orange, in July and headlining Saturday Night Live's season premiere in September. Throughout this period he has also been handling the reverberations of something he revealed on Tumblr just before Channel Orange's debut: his memories of an intimate relationship with his first love, a man—a rare admission in the macho world of hip-hop and R&B.

It's important to Ocean to be the master of his own identity: Last year he changed his name from Lonny Breaux to Christopher Francis Ocean, drawing on Frank Sinatra and the original Ocean's 11 film for inspiration. And yet he admits that the failed relationship he mentioned on Tumblr sent him spinning out of control, rocking him even as it improved his musicality, transforming him from a man with skills to a skillful man with something he suddenly was burning to say. What was going through his mind this summer, he tells me, was something like this: "If I'm going to say this, I'm going to be better than all you pieces of shit. What you going to say now? You can't say, 'Oh, they're only listening to him because he said this.' No, they're listening to me because I'm gifted, and this project is brilliant."

[Interview:]
GQ: GQ: You were born in Long Beach, California, but moved to New Orleans at age 5. When is the first time you realized you wanted to write and perform music?
Frank Ocean: fo: I feel like I was writing as I was learning to talk. Writing was always a goto form of communication. And I knew I could sing from being in tune with the radio. I would listen to whatever my mom played in the car—the big divas: Whitney, Mariah, Celine, Anita Baker. Then I got exposed to Prince. I think it was "The Beautiful Ones." He was screaming at the end. And this lady who was playing it was saying, "Ain't no man scream like Prince." And I was like, "That's fucking awesome."
GQ: Your dad had left when you were 6, so your mom raised you on her own.
Frank Ocean: I haven't seen him since. And for a while, you know, we were not middle-class. We were poor. But my mom never accepted that. She worked hard to become a residential contractor—got her master's with honors at the University of New Orleans. I used to go to every class with her. Her father was my paternal figure. He'd had a really troubled life with crack, heroin, and alcohol and had kids he wasn't an ideal parent to. I was his second chance, and he gave it his best shot. My grandfather was smart and had a whole lot of pride. He didn't speak a terrible amount, but you could tell there was a ton on his mind—like a quiet acceptance of how life had turned out. He was a mentor at AA and NA, and I would go with him to meetings.

GQ: When did you start recording?
Frank Ocean: I booked my first studio at like 12 or 13. Somewhere in that season of my life, singing along with the radio became me wanting to be on radio, you know. And writing Langston Hughes replica poems became me wanting to write like Stevie Wonder. My dad had been a singer and keyboardist. So my mom was like, "You're going to follow that bum? Maybe you should just go to law school."

GQ: You stayed in New Orleans until after Katrina, then drove cross-country with just $1,100 in your pocket. What made you move to Los Angeles?
Frank Ocean: I had been putting together these demos that I was going to properly record in a real studio in L.A. So I saved up money doing Sheetrocking, and I drove out with my girlfriend at the time. I was only supposed to be there for six weeks. I don't feel like I ever made a conscious decision to stay six years. You just kind of roll. The first four and a half years was me in the studio every day, writing songs for other people. I had jobs, too—eleven jobs. I worked at Kinko's, Fatburger, Subway—I was a sandwich artist—and I was a claims processor at Allstate Insurance.

GQ: So how did you go from Fatburger to writing songs for Brandy and Justin Bieber and John Legend?
Frank Ocean: We're talking about hundreds of things that happened. One night, I went to a listening party just to pick up my backpack from a friend. Next thing I know, I'm in this studio, and everybody's putting their laptops on the pool table, playing songs through these big-ass speakers. It was crazy. And they wanted me to play, so I plugged in, and they were like, "Oh shit." There were producers there, and they said, "You should come up to the studio and write." So I did. I'd sit in those rooms for hours. But I wouldn't write any line that was as good as the lines being written in the rooms next to me. It was just like: I had to elevate. I was looking at it like an athlete then—like I just wanted to be better than everybody else. I hadn't gone through anything emotionally yet. I had never been in love. I had never been heartbroken. When that happened, that's really what changed everything. That turned me into a real artist. It made the difference between somebody hearing something of mine and being like, "Wow, this is a fresh approach," and somebody hearing something and crying, you know?

GQ: You're talking about the relationship you wrote about on your Tumblr page—the one that you likened to "being thrown from a cliff" when you were 19. How did that change your songwriting?
Frank Ocean: It became effortless. Like breathing. Because now I have something I really need to say. It was Mindfuck.net. It was a floodgate. It opened up the works.

GQ: Def Jam reportedly signed you as a recording artist in 2009 but didn't open up its checkbook at that point to help you record. The next year, you met Tyler, the Creator, and the other members of Odd Future. How important was that?
Frank Ocean: I was at a real dark time in my life when I met them. I was looking for just a reprieve. At 20 or 21, I had, I think, a couple hundred thousand dollars 

[from producing and songwriting], a nice car, a Beverly Hills apartment—and I was miserable. Because of the relationship in part and the heartbreak in part, and also just miserable because of like just carting that around. And here was this group of like-minded individuals whose irreverence made me revere. The do-it-yourself mentality of OF really rubbed off on me.

GQ: They inspired you to record your first album, Nostalgia, Ultra, on your own dime and release it for free, right? Def Jam had signed Lonny Breaux, then this Frank Ocean guy puts out an Internet sensation that makes a lot of best-albums lists. When they tried to sign you again, was it satisfying to say, "Oh, you already have"?
Frank Ocean: Yeah, I just told them, "Give me $1 million if you want the next album."

[Re-Introduction:]
It's still sprinkling a bit when we dive back into the hired Lexus and head across the East River to the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens. I've suggested it because I know Ocean's love of movies is so engulfing that they've become a part of his vocabulary. On his first album, he sampled some of the dialogue in Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, and he tells me he got the inspiration for his hit song "Super Rich Kids" from Steven Soderbergh's Traffic. He has said that he sees writing a song as making a photograph out of materials that aren't visible.

So it's no surprise when Ocean whips out his phone and starts taking pictures—of the Men in Black 3 monster exhibit, of the weird installation with beanbag chairs, even of the angular stairways. But the highlight is when we come upon a collection of vintage arcade games. Anyone who saw Ocean's performance on SNL has an inkling of his love of games. (He finished his set that night by retreating to play Galaga as John Mayer riffed on guitar.) Now, as he spots the original Pong, Super Breakout, Asteroids, Galaxian, Donkey Kong, and Frogger games, all in a row, he steps more quickly, as if greeting old friends.
This, I realize, is a sort of Frank Ocean version of heaven. Because these aren't just decommissioned museum pieces. You can buy tokens and actually play. I buy four, and he chooses Battle Zone, in which you try to sink things that appear on the horizon. His first game he scores 7,000 points, and the machine prompts him to type his initials in the winner's circle: CFO, in seventh place. His fourth game, he racks up 12,000 points—second place. But when I congratulate him, he points to the number one score: it's 12,000, too. "I'm the same as first place," says the man who must be better than all those other pieces of shit. And then we get back in the car.

[Interview:]
GQ: Is it true that you wrote the songs for Channel Orange in three weeks?
Frank Ocean: Yeah, then I worked on them for nine months—a typical gestation period.

GQ: You're something of a perfectionist, I gather.
Frank Ocean: John Mayer and I were talking in rehearsal before SNL, and he was like, "You love to take the hardest way. You don't always have to." But I don't know about that. It's like Billy Joel says in that song "Vienna." When the truth is told / That you can get what you want or you can just get old. We all know we have a finite period of time. I just feel if I'm going to be alive, I want to be challenged—to be as immortal as possible. The path to that isn't an easy way, but it's a rewarding way.

I never think about myself as an artist working in this time. I think about it in macro. I feel like Elton John just made "Tiny Dancer." He just made that shit like last night. Jimi Hendrix just burned his fucking guitar onstage. Right? Freddie Mercury just had the half mike stand in his hand in the fucking stadium. Prince was just on the mountain in "Under the Cherry Moon." And I was there. That's how I look at it. Like this shit just went down. You see the mastery that I'm surrounded by? How on earth am I going to take the easiest way? A friend of mine jokes that I have a painstaking royalty complex. Like maybe I was a duke in a past life. But all you have is 100 percent. Period.

GQ: Let's talk about your open letter on Tumblr. Posting that must've felt like the hardest way.
Frank Ocean: Yes, absolutely.

GQ: So why did you do it? Were some people raising questions about the male pronouns in a few of the songs?
Frank Ocean: I had Skyped into a listening session that Def Jam was hosting for Channel Orange, and one of the journalists, very harmlessly—quotation gestures in the air, "very harmlessly"—wrote a piece and mentioned that. I was just like, "Fuck it. Talk about it, don't talk about it—talk about this." No more mystery. Through with that.

GQ: You'd written the letter back in December, for inclusion in the liner notes. Were you afraid of the aftermath when you finally posted it in July?
Frank Ocean: The night I posted it, I cried like a fucking baby. It was like all the frequency just clicked to a change in my head. All the receptors were now receiving a different signal, and I was happy. I hadn't been happy in so long. I've been sad again since, but it's a totally different take on sad. There's just some magic in truth and honesty and openness.

GQ: Exactly how did your perspective change?
Frank Ocean: Whatever I said in that letter, before I posted it, seemed so huge. But when you come out the other side, now your brain—instead of receiving fear—sees "Oh, shit happened and nothing happened." Brain says, "Self, I'm fine." I look around, and I'm touching my fucking limbs, and I'm good. Before anybody called me and said congratulations or anything nice, it had already changed. It wasn't from outside. It was completely in here, in my head.

GQ: Did you worry it would derail your career?
Frank Ocean: I had those fears. In black music, we've got so many leaps and bounds to make with acceptance and tolerance in regard to that issue. It reflects something just ingrained, you know. When I was growing up, there was nobody in my family—not even my mother—who I could look to and be like, "I know you've never said anything homophobic." So, you know, you worry about people in the business who you've heard talk that way. Some of my heroes coming up talk recklessly like that. It's tempting to give those views and words—that ignorance—more attention than they deserve. Very tempting.
Some people said, "He's saying he fell in love with a guy for hype." As if that's the best hype you can get in hip-hop or black music. So I knew that if I was going to say what I said, it had to be in concert with one of the most brilliant pieces of art that has come out in my generation. And that's what I did. Why can I say that? Why I don't have to affect all this humility and shit is because I worked my ass off. I worked my face off. And the part that you love the most is the easiest part for me. So I'll do it again.

GQ: I'm sure if you'd wanted an excuse not to reveal the relationship, you could have found ten people in the industry who would have said, "Wait."
Frank Ocean: The pitch is, "You'll encounter less resistance in life if you say, 'No, I'm going to just keep dating girls.' " But then you're minimizing the resistance that you're feeling from yourself on the inside. There's so much upkeep on that shit. So much upkeep on a lie. But at least everybody else is cool with how you carry on with your life. That's what they say. But know what fear does to your strength. You don't even feel smart or capable. You just feel broken—and not just your heart. Just a broken person.

GQ: So do you consider yourself bisexual?
Frank Ocean: You can move to the next question. I'll respectfully say that life is dynamic and comes along with dynamic experiences, and the same sentiment that I have towards genres of music, I have towards a lot of labels and boxes and shit. I'm in this business to be creative—I'll even diminish it and say to be a content provider. One of the pieces of content that I'm for fuck sure not giving is porn videos. I'm not a centerfold. I'm not trying to sell you sex. People should pay attention to that in the letter: I didn't need to label it for it to have impact. Because people realize everything that I say is so relatable, because when you're talking about romantic love, both sides in all scenarios feel the same shit. As a writer, as a creator, I'm giving you my experiences. But just take what I give you. You ain't got to pry beyond that. I'm giving you what I feel like you can feel. The other shit, you can't feel. You can't feel a box. You can't feel a label. Don't get caught up in that shit. There's so much something in life. Don't get caught up in the nothing. That shit is nothing, you know? It's nothing. Vanish the fear.

As we make our way back from Astoria, Ocean tells me that he's got at least five projects in the works, among them a song he wrote for Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained; songs he's working on for Alicia Keys and Beyoncé; songs for his own third album; and a European tour, which he says he wants to model on Pink Floyd's The Wall tour. He's even thinking about maybe opening his own arcade (though later he'll post on Tumblr that this idea is "morphing").

He is considering buying a place in New York City. He needs a break from L.A.'s relentless sunshine, he says, and right now Manhattan is giving him exactly that: The rain is coming down in sheets. We pull up to his SoHo hotel, and he asks if we can idle while he runs in to get "studio-ready." A few minutes later, he emerges, laptop in hand. He's switched his contacts out for glasses and changed into what looks like board shorts and another Supreme hoodie, this one maroon. It's 9 p.m. on a Friday as we head back to Jungle City. Pharrell is out in Brooklyn, waiting for Jay-Z to take the stage. But not Ocean. He has a song to write.

[Verse 1]
Gon' walk down that dirt road, ’til someone lets me ride
Gon' walk down that dirt road, ’til someone lets me ride
If I can’t find my baby, I’m gonna run away and hide

[Verse 2]
Well, I've have been pacing around the room hoping maybe she’d come back
Pacing around the room hoping maybe she’d come back
Well, I have been praying for salvation laying ’round in a one-room country shack

[Verse 3]
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed
’Til there’s nothing left to see, ’til the chains have been shattered
And I’ve been freed

[Verse 4]
But I've been looking at my shadow, I been watching the colors up above
Looking at my shadow, watching the colors up above
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love

[Interlude]

[Verse 5]
Gon' walk on down that dirt road 'til everything becomes the same
Gon' walk down that dirt road 'til everything becomes the same
Well, I keep on walking 'til I hear her holler out my name

[Verse 1]
You took a part of me that I really miss
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this
You told yourself a lie, that’s all right mama I told myself one too
I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

[Verse 2]
You took the silver, you took the gold
You left me standing out in the cold
People ask about you, I didn’t tell them everything I knew
Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

[Verse 3]
I’m drifting in and out of dreamless sleep
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep
Did so many things I never did intend to do
Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

[Verse 4]
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low
I need every bit of it for the places that I go
Sometimes I wonder just what it’s all coming to
Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

[Verse 5]
Well, I don’t dare close my eyes and I don’t dare wink
Maybe in the next life I’ll be able to hear myself think
Feel like talking to somebody but I just don’t know who
Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

[Verse 6]
The last thing you said before you hit the street
“Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet”
I said, “That’s all right mama you  you do what you gotta do”
Well, I’m trying to get closer. I’m still a million miles from you

[Verse 7]
Rock me, pretty baby; rock me ’till everything gets real
Rock me for a little while; rock me ’till there’s nothing left to feel
And I’ll rock you too
I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

[Verse 8]
Well, there’s voices in the night trying to be heard
I’m sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word
I know plenty of people who would put me up for a day or two
Yes, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

[Verse 1]
The air is getting hotter
There’s a rumbling in the skies
I’ve been wading through the high muddy water
With the heat rising in my eyes
Every day your memory grows dimmer
It doesn’t haunt me like it did before
I’ve been walking through the middle of nowhere
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door

[Verse 2]
When I was in Missouri
They would not let me be
I had to leave there in a hurry
I only saw what they let me see
You broke a heart that loved you
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
I’ve been walking that lonesome valley
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door

[Verse 3]
People on the platforms
Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts a-beatin’
Like pendulums swinging on chains
When you think that you've lost everything
You find out you can always lose a little more
I’m just going down the road feeling bad
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door

[Verse 4]
I’m going down the river
Down to New Orleans
They tell me everything is gonna be all right
But I don’t know what “all right” even means
I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary-Jane
Miss Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore
I been all around the world, boys
Now I’m trying to get to heaven before they close the door

[Verse 5]
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
And relive my dreams
I’ll close my eyes and I wonder
If everything is as hollow as it seems
Some trains don't pull no gamblers
No midnight ramblers like they did before
I been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down
Now I’m trying to get to heaven before they close the door

[Verse 1]
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body’s tense
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence
I’ve been hit too hard, I’ve seen too much
Nothing can heal me now, but your touch
I don’t know what I’m gonna do
I was all right ’til I fell in love with you

[Verse 2]
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky
I thought it would rain but the clouds passed by
Now I feel like I’m coming to the end of my way
But I know God is my shield and he won’t lead me astray
Still I don’t know what I’m gonna do
I was all right ’til I fell in love with you

[Verse 3]
Boys in the street beginning to play
Girls like birds flying away
When I’m gone you will remember my name
I’m gonna win my way to wealth and fame
I don’t know what I’m gonna do
I was all right ’til I fell in love with you

[Verse 4]
Junk is piling up, taking up space
My eyes feel like they’re falling off my face
Sweat falling down, I’m staring at the floor
I’m thinking about that girl who won’t be back no more
I just don't know what to do
I was all right ’til I fell in love with you

[Verse 5]
Well, I’m tired of talking, I’m tired of trying to explain
My attempts to please you were all in vain
Tomorrow night before the sun goes down
If I’m still among the living, I’ll be Dixie bound
I just don’t know what I’m gonna do
I was all right ’til I fell in love with you

[Verse 1]
Shadows are falling
And I’ve been here all day
It’s too hot to sleep
And time is running away
Feel like my soul has
Turned into steel
I’ve still got the scars
That the sun didn’t heal
There’s not even room enough
To be anywhere

[Refrain]
It’s not dark yet
But it’s getting there

[Verse 2]
Well, my sense of humanity
Has gone down the drain
Behind every beautiful thing
There’s been some kind of pain
She wrote me a letter
And she wrote it so kind
She put down in writin'
What was in her mind
I just don’t see why I should even care

[Refrain]
It’s not dark yet
But it’s getting there

[Verse 3]
Well, I’ve been to London
And I’ve been to gay Paris
I’ve followed the river
And I got to the sea
I’ve been down on the bottom
Of a world full of lies
I ain’t looking for nothing
In anyone’s eyes
Sometimes my burden
Is more than I can bear

[Refrain]
It’s not dark yet
But it’s getting there

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 4]
I was born here and I’ll die here
Against my will
I know it looks like I’m moving
But I’m standing still
Every nerve in my body
Is so vacant and numb
I can’t even remember what it was
I came here to get away from
Don’t even hear a murmur of a prayer

[Refrain]
It’s not dark yet
But it’s getting there

[Verse 1]
I’m beginning to hear voices and there’s no one around
Well, I’m all used up and the fields have turned brown
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by
My love for her is taking such a long time to die

I’m waist deep, waist deep in the mist
It’s almost like, almost like I don’t exist
I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

[Verse 2]
The walls of pride are high and wide
Can’t see over to the other side
It’s such a sad thing to see beauty decay
It’s sadder still to feel your heart torn away

One look at you and I’m out of control
Like the universe has swallowed me whole
I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

[Verse 3]
There’s too many people, too many to recall
I thought some of ’m were friends of mine, I was wrong about ’m all
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside’s mud
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood
I found my world, found my world in you
But your love just hasn’t proved true
I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

[Verse 4]
Oh, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds
Reality has always had too many heads
Some things last longer than you think they will
There are some kind of things you can never kill

It’s you and you only I been thinking about
But you can’t see in and it’s hard lookin’ out
I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

[Verse 5]
Well the fat’s in the fire and the water’s in the tank
The whiskey’s in the jar and the money’s in the bank
I tried to love and protect you because I cared
I’m gonna remember forever the joy that we shared

Looking at you and I’m on my bended knee
You have no idea what you do to me
I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

[Verse 1]
I can’t wait, wait for you to change your mind
It’s late, I’m trying to walk the line
Well, it’s way past midnight and there are people all around
Some on their way up, some on their way down
The air burns and I’m trying to think straight
And I don’t know how much longer I can wait

[Verse 2]
I’m your man, I’m trying to recover the sweet love that we knew
You understand that my heart can’t go on beating without you
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I’m reeling from the blow
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so
I’m breathing hard, standing at the gate
But I don’t know how much longer I can wait

[Verse 3]
Skies are grey, I’m looking for anything that will bring a happy glow
Night or day, it doesn’t matter where I go anymore, I just go
If I ever saw you coming I don’t know what I would do
I’d like to think I could control myself, but it isn’t true
That’s how it is when things disintegrate
And I don’t know how much longer I can wait

[Bridge]
I’m doomed to love you, I’ve been rolling through stormy weather
I’m thinking of you and all the places we could roam together

[Verse 4]
It’s mighty funny, the end of time has just begun
Oh, honey, after all these years you’re still the one
While I’m strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate
But I don’t know how much longer I can wait

[Verse 1]
I like ‘em mad, bad baby, you could be the one
If you wanna get trashed and have fun
Throw me wholly in the sky like a pizza pie (Are you crazy?)
You take my whole world, baby, and twist it to the right
Throw me in the air and whoop like dynamite
Baby you know anytime you can swing by

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I like ‘em bad, boy
Wrong side of the track, boy, oh
You know I like ‘em bad boy, like you
(Like you, you know I do)
I like a man with kick, yeah
So come around and hit me up
No other man can lick me like you
(Like you, you know what you do)

[Chorus]
Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
I’m not gonna do it, baby (no way)
Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
You only show a little but you give me more
Behind, behind, behind
Behind closed doors
(No one can see us)
(I know you like me)

[Verse 2]
I see my best friends kissing
Touching all the time
But I don’t need no jet to write it in the sky
I see it in his eyes, I’m his cherry pie

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I like ‘em bad, boy
They think you make me sad, boy, no
The best I ever had, boy, it's you
(Like you, you know I do)
I want a man that's hot, yeah
To come around and rock me, yeah
No one can dirty talk me
(Like you, you know what you do)

[Chorus]
Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
I’m not gonna do it, baby (no way)
Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
You only shout a little but you give me more
Behind, behind, behind
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors

[Bridge]
Everybody's at the park tonight
Everybody's at the shore
Everybody's on the street tonight
What the hell would we do that for?
Everybody's at the park tonight
But we got fireworks galore, behind closed doors
Behind closed doors

[Chorus]
Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
I’m not gonna do it, baby (no way)
Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
You only shout a little but you give me more
Behind, behind, behind
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors

[Intro]
I killed my former and
Left her in the trunk on Highway 10
Put the knife under the hood
If you find it, send it straight to Hollywood
Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha-ha

Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha-ha

Aura-a-a-a, aura-a-a-a

[Verse 1]
I'm not a wandering slave, I am a woman of choice
My veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face
You ought to pity me 'cause was arranged one man to love
But in the bedroom, the size of him's more than enough

[Chorus]
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?
Behind the aura, behind the aura, behind the aura?

[Verse 2]
Enigma popstar is fun, she wear burqa for fashion
It's not a statement as much as just a move of passion
I may not walk on your street or shoot a gun on your soil
I hear you screaming, is it because of pleasure or toil?

[Bridge]
Dance, sex, art, pop, tech
Dance, sex, art, pop, tech

[Chorus]
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?
Behind the aura, behind the curtain, behind the burqa

[Outro]
ART-POP

[Intro]
With good understanding
And a lot of patience
You can make it, yes you can
Beyond your wildest dreams

[Verse 1]
Here we are in the prime of life
We're so ripe
Yeah the time's right
Here we go and we're high of expectations
Let's not waste them

[Hook]
Oh the sunshine in your eyes could break the ice
I can tell that you deserve the best in life
If I offer you the chance to live tonight
Then take it
We can make it

[Bridge]
Don't wait til tomorrow
Don't wait til tomorrow, let's go
Don't wait til tomorrow
We waited all our lives
Don't waste another day

[Verse 2]
Hesitation will only get you nowhere
Don't just stand there
Every moment is a gift
Here's your moment to live
Don't have no fear

[Hook]
Oh the sunshine in your eyes could break the ice
I can tell that you deserve the best in life
If I offer you the chance to live tonight
Then take it
We can make it

[Outro]
It's our time
It's our evening
Don't let it slip away
Tomorrow's too late
It's our night, please don't leave me
If you're lost I'll help you find your way
Your way to tomorrow
Oh don't you know we're gonna get together
Your way to tomorrow
Don't wait til tomorrow
Oh we're gonna get together

[Verse 1]
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore
His mama sure was proud of him!
He stood straight and tall in his uniform and all
His mama’s face broke out all in a grin

[Verse 2]
“Oh son, you look so fine, I’m glad you’re a son of mine
You make me proud to know you hold a gun
Do what the captain says, lots of medals you will get
And we’ll put them on the wall when you come home”

[Verse 3]
As that old train pulled out, John’s ma began to shout
Telling’ everyone in the neighborhood:
“That’s my son that’s about to go, he’s a soldier now, you know”
She made well sure her neighbors understood

[Verse 4]
She got a letter once in a while and her face broke into a smile
As she showed them to the people from next door
And she bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
And these things you called a good old-fashioned war
Oh! Good old-fashioned war!

[Verse 5]
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come
They ceased to come for about ten months or more
Then a letter finally came saying, “Go down and meet the train
Your son’s a-coming home from the war”

[Verse 6]
She smiled and went right down, she looked everywhere around
But she could not see her soldier son in sight
But as all the people passed, she saw her son at last
When she did she could hardly believe her eyes

[Verse 7]
Oh his face was all shot up and his hand was all blown off
And he wore a metal brace around his waist
He whispered kind of slow, in a voice she did not know
While she couldn’t even recognize his face!

Oh! Lord! Not even recognize his face

[Verse 8]
“Oh tell me, my darling son, pray tell me what they done
How is it you come to be this way?”
He tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly move
And the mother had to turn her face away

[Verse 9]
“Don’t you remember, Ma, when I went off to war
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
I was on the battleground, you were home. Acting proud
You wasn’t there standing in my shoes”

[Verse 10]
“Oh, and I thought when I was there, God, what am I doing here?
I’m a-tryin’ to kill somebody or die tryin’
But the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came close
And I saw that his face looked just like mine”

Oh! Lord! Just like mine!

[Verse 11]
“And I couldn’t help but think, through the thunder rolling and stink
That I was just a puppet in a play
And through the roar and smoke, this string is finally broke
And a cannon ball blew my eyes away”

[Verse 12]
As he turned away to walk, his Ma was still in shock
At seeing’ the metal brace that helped him stand
But as he turned to go, he called his mother close
And he dropped his medals down into her hand

[Produced by 88 Keys, Dave Tozer & Kanye West]

[Verse 1]
Broken hearts rain on our heads 'til it floods
But I won’t run, I’m with you, that’s enough
Kiss me now so you won’t run

[Hook]
Out of breath underwater
Girl you can hold on longer
Girl you can hold on longer
Girl you can hold on longer
Long as you want
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Love is an ocean
Swimming and try not to drown
Right in the waves
Praying we don’t go down
In the undertow I’ll pull you out

[Hook]
Out of breath underwater
Girl you can hold on longer
Girl you can hold on longer
Girl you can hold on longer
Long as you want
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Produced by The Runners & Co]

[Verse 1]
A little trouble in the city
Trouble in my home
She told me love don't live here anymore
I wanna run to the light
It's too dark in this part of night
I need somebody who can make it right

[Hook]
And it's on tonight
How about we go and save the night
I can see you want it and so do I
How about we go and save the night
Let's save the night

[Verse 2]
I'm not a one man band
I want to sing a duet
You and me would sound much better
You look so good in my bed
And if your gonna go out
You're gonna go out with a bang
Let's save the night I'll be your superman

[Hook]
And it's on tonight
How about we go and save the night
I can see you want it and so do I
How about we go and save the night
Let's save the night

[Bridge]
I see the night flashing before her eyes
Resuscitating bring it back to life

[Hook]
And it's on tonight
How about we go and save the night
I can see you want it and so do I
How about we go and save the night
Let's save the night

[Verse 1]
Baby, it seems the time is never right
You're goin' left and I'm goin' right
Its crazy
But I'm still waiting

[Pre-Chorus]
If I play my cards right
My lucks gonna strike
Until then there's a night
All I wanna do

[Chorus]
Is dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Like lovers do
And it might come true

[Bridge]
If I dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
It just might be the only time that I'm with you
When I dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream
Oh, I dream
Yes, I dream
Dream, dream
Dream, dream
They say that dreams they sometimes do come true

[Verse 2]
Your star shines so bright
You're the queen of my night
In the daytime not quite
But I'm so glad that I

[Chorus]
Can dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Like lovers do
And it might come true

[Outro]
If I dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
It just might be the only time that I'm with you
When I dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream
Of you

[Intro]
Yeah, you wanna be loved, yeah
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
You wanna be loved, yeah
Listen

[Verse 1]
Everywhere I go, everywhere I’ll be
I see lonely hearts and falling leaves
Where do those hearts go, do they find their match
Or do they drift away, it’s time to bring them back

[Hook 1]
They wanna be loved, they wanna be loved
Come on, it’s simple enough
They wanna be loved, yeah

They wanna be loved, they wanna be loved
A little piece to the heart
They wanna be loved

[Verse 2]
But everybody knows it don’t always last
But if I can’t have it for long, then I want it fast
Better love for now, than for never at all
So baby, if you’re down, give me a call!

[Hook 2]
I wanna be loved, I wanna be loved
Come on, it’s simple enough
I wanna be loved, yeah
Alright, c'mon

I wanna be loved, I wanna be loved
A little piece to the heart
I wanna be loved
Yeah

[Bridge]
La la la la
Yeah, don’t you wanna be loved
Yeah, sing for love, yeah!
Yeah, don’t you wanna be loved?

[Hook 3]
You wanna be loved, you wanna be loved
Come on, it’s simple enough
You wanna be loved, yeah
Alright
You wanna be loved, you wanna be loved
A little piece to the heart
You wanna be loved, oh yeah!

[Hook]
Our love's an asylum
Where you and I go
Our love's an asylum
Where we go, go, go, go crazy

[Verse 1]
In a state of madness
Wrapped up in your magic
Ecstatic, an addict
Oh we've landed
On another planet
And it feels like home here
We'll never go back there
Cause we're crazy
I'll go crazy with you
You're so crazy
I'll go crazy with you

[Hook]
Our love's an asylum
Where you and I go

Crazy - I'll do crazy with you
Let's go crazy, I'll go crazy with you

[Hook]
Our love's an asylum
Where you and I go
Our love's an asylum
Where we go, go, go, go crazy

[Verse 2]
Now we got time
Let's stay in
I'm sayin'

We'll light some candles with the lights off
So we can set the mood right off

[Hook]

I'm tryin' to get caught up in your love tonight
You can help me just breathe, breathe

[Verse 1]
Ol' black Bascom, doesn’t break no mirrors
Cold black water dog, make no tears
You say you love me with what may be love
Don’t you remember making baby love?
Got your steam drill bit and you're looking for some kid
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did
But I know that you know that I know that you show
Something is tearing up your mind

[Chorus]
Tell me, momma
Tell me, momma
Tell me, momma, what is it?
What's wrong with you this time?

[Verse 2]
Hey, John, come and get me some candy goods
Shucks, it sure feels like it's in the woods
Spend some time on your January trips
You got tombstone moose up and your grave-yard whips
If you're anxious to find out when your friendship's gonna end
Come on, baby, I'm your friend
And I know that you know that I know that you show
Something is tearing up your mind

[Chorus]
Tell me, momma
Tell me, momma
Tell me, momma, what is it?
What's wrong with you this time?

[Verse 3]
Oh, we bone the editor, can't get rid
But his painted sled, instead it's a bed
Yes, I see you on your window ledge
But I can't tell just how far away you are from the edge
And, anyway, you're just gonna make people jump and roar
Watcha wanna go and do that for?
For I know that you know that I know that you know
Something is tearing up your mind

[Chorus]
Tell me, momma
Tell me, momma
Tell me, momma, what is it?
What’s wrong with you this time?

[Intro]
Down low double life

[Verse 1]
1, 2 equals us, she, she and me, I fell in loves
How could something so right go so wrong
Just coming in on flight 412
But she was listening on the phone
I thought I had it all together
But I was wrong obviously
'Cause what was once done in the dark
Came to light eventually

[Chorus]
Living down low, down low
Living that double life
Living down low, down low
Living that double life
It ain't right

[Verse 2]
I don't believe the shit I did the night we were at your mom's
I got a page from out of town, lied and said it was my job
Grabbed my hat, coat, gloves and scarf
I told you that I would return
But by the look upon your face you had already discerned
You pulled me to the side and you begged for me to stay
But I was caught up in a life that forced me to walk away

[Chorus]
Living down low, down low
Living that double life
Living down low, down low
Living that double life
It ain't right

[Interlude]
Okay you, you're saying you came in and
And these two women they, they poured
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, it wasn't nothing like that
All I know is uh, I was asleep, they came in
Woke me up pourin' hot grits
And all kinds of shit on me man, okay beatin' me and shit
Hittin' me with all sorts of type shit (Damn)

[Verse 3]
With a cigar in my mouth over Vegas city lights
On a path way up the hill to be with my other wife
A rich nigga living strife going on like nothing's wrong
But that damn Caller ID is the reason for this song
So one called up the other while I was out playing some golf
Talking about my doggish ways and how I need to be droppped off

[Chorus]
Living down low, down low
Living that double life
Living down low, down low
Living that double life
It ain't right

[Bridge]
Now go ahead, shoot me now because I'm guilty as sin
Playin' Russian roulette with hearts not to mention the kids
Now every day I live I regret all that I did
Out smoking with friends as I reminisced

[Chorus]
Living down low, down low
Living that double life
Living down low, down low
Living that double life
It ain't right

[Outro]
I can't take it no more I've got to confess
See now, I don't know why
I thought that I could keep creeping
'Cause you see what goes around
Comes back on around and back on around
And back on around again, yes it does
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
In a state of shock that's what it left me
Take it from a man who knows
That three ain't company
No, no, no that's what I kept telling myself
Now I done lost the houses the kids and the dogs
Now I'm sleeping in my momma's house
And even she says, your sorry ass don't deserve no help
Must be because of what my old man did to her
Niggas
Rockland

[Verse 1]
The evening winds are still
I've lost the way and will
Can't tell you where they went
I just know what they meant
I'm always on my guard
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me

[Verse 2]
The friend you used to be
So near and dear to me
You slipped so far away
Where did we go a-stray
I pass the old schoolyard
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me

[Verse 3]
Ever since the day
The day you went away
I felt that emptiness so wide
I don't know what's wrong or right
I just know I need strength to fight
Strength to fight that world outside

[Verse 4]
Since we've been out of touch
I haven't felt that much
From day to barren day
My heart stays locked away
I walk the boulevard
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me

[Verse 5]
The sun is sinking low
I guess it's time to go
I feel a chilly breeze
In place of memories
My dreams are locked and barred
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me

[Verse 1]
Cut open my heart
Right at the scar
And loosen up
Gonna do what I'm told
Go where I'm told
And loosen up
Take a shot in the rain
One for the pain
And loosen up

[Chorus]
I tried all the way
Wait for me, wait for me
It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me

[Verse 2]
Going to soften the blow
Soften the blow
And give it up
I saw the surprise
The look in your eyes
I gave it up
Gonna be who I am
Be who I am
And give it up

[Chorus]
I tried all the way
Wait for me, wait for me
It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Bridge]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me

[Verse 1]
Bye and bye, I'm breathin' a lover's sigh
While I'm sittin' on my watch so I can be on time
I'm singin' love's praises with sugar-coated rhyme
Bye and bye, on you I'm casting my eye

[Verse 2]
I'm paintin' the town, swinging my partner around
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust
I'm watchin' the roads, I'm studying the dust
I'm paintin' the town
Making my last go-round

[Chorus]
Well, I'm scufflin' and I'm shufflin' and I'm walkin' on briars
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires

[Verse 3]
I'm rollin' slow
I'm doing all I know
I'm tellin' myself I found true happiness
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed
I'm rollin' slow
Goin' where the wild roses grow

[Chorus]
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past
You were my first love and you will be my last

[Verse 4]
Papa gone mad
Mamma, she's feeling sad
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war
Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can be

[Verse 1]
Well, today has been a sad ol' lonesome day
Yeah, today has been a sad ol' lonesome day
I'm just sitting here thinking
With my mind a million miles away

[Verse 2]
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor
When I left my long-time darling
She was standing in the door

[Verse 3]
Well, my Pa he died and left me; my brother got killed in the war
Well, my Pa he died and left me; my brother got killed in the war
My sister, she ran off and got married
Never was heard of anymore

[Verse 4]
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months
Don't know how it looked to other people
I never slept with her even once

[Verse 5]
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast
Funny, how the things you have the hardest time parting with
Are the things you need the least

[Verse 6]
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive
Setting my dial on the radio
I wish my mother was still alive

[Verse 7]
I seen your loverman coming, coming across the barren field
I see your loverman coming, coming 'cross the barren field
He not a gentleman at all, he rotten to the core
He's a coward and he steals

[Verse 8]
Well, my Captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled and he's skilled
My Captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled and he's skilled
He’s not sentimental, don’t bother him at all
How many of his pals have been killed

[Verse 9]
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was
Last night the wind was whispering something, I was trying to make out what it was
Yeah, I tell myself something's coming
But it never does

[Verse 10]
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd
I'm gonna teach peace to the conquered
I'm gonna tame the proud

[Verse 11]
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf
You're gonna need my help, sweetheart
You can't make love all by yourself

[Verse 1]
Down over the window
Comes the dazzling sunlit rays
Through the back alleys—through the blinds
Another one of them endless days

[Verse 2]
Honey bees are buzzing
Leaves begin to stir
I’m in love with my second cousin
I tell myself I could be happy forever with her

[Verse 3]
I keep listening for footsteps
But I ain’t hearing any
From the boat I fish for bullheads
I catch a lot, sometimes too many

[Verse 4]
A summer breeze is blowing
A squall is settin’ in
Sometimes it’s just plain stupid
To get into any kind of wind

[Verse 5]
The old men ’round here, sometimes they get
On bad terms with the younger men
But old, young, age don’t carry weight
It doesn’t matter in the end

[Verse 6]
One of the boss’ hangers-on
Comes to call at times you least expect
Try to bully ya—strong-arm you—inspire you with fear
It has the opposite effect

[Verse 7]
There’s a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town
The old one is long gone
Timber two-foot-six across
Burns with the bark still on

[Verse 8]
They say times are hard, if you don’t believe it
You can just follow your nose
It don’t bother me—times are hard everywhere
We’ll just have to see how it goes

[Verse 9]
My old man, he’s like some feudal lord
Got more lives than a cat
Never seen him quarrel with my mother even once
Things come alive or they fall flat

[Verse 10]
You can smell the pinewood burning
You can hear the school bell ring
Gotta get up near the teacher if you can
If you wanna learn anything

[Verse 11]
Romeo, he said to Juliet, “You got a poor complexion
It doesn’t give your appearance a very youthful touch!”
Juliet said back to Romeo, “Why don’t you just shove off
If it bothers you so much”

[Verse 12]
They all got out of here any way they could
The cold rain can give you the shivers
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee
All the rest of them rebel rivers

[Verse 13]
If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again
You do so at the peril of your own life
I’m not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound
I’ve seen enough heartaches and strife

[Verse 14]
My grandfather was a duck trapper
He could do it with just dragnets and ropes
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth
I don’t know if they had any dreams or hopes

[Verse 15]
I had them once though, I suppose, to go along
With all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all of the Christmas eves
I left all my dreams and hopes
Buried under tobacco leaves

[Verse 16]
It’s not always easy kicking someone out
Gotta wait a while—it can be an unpleasant task
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up
And tears or not, it’s too much to ask

[Verse 1]
The seasons they are turnin' and my sad heart is yearning
To hear again the songbird’s sweet melodious tone
Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone?

[Verse 2]
The dusky light, the day is losing, Orchids, Poppies, Black-eyed Susan
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone
Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone?

[Verse 3]
The air is thick and heavy all along the levy
Where the geese into the countryside have flown
Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone?

[Bridge]
Well, I’m preaching peace and harmony
The blessings of tranquility
Yet I know when the time is right to strike
I’ll take you cross the river dear
You’ve no need to linger here
I know the kinds of things you like

[Verse 4]
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs an’
The branches cast their shadows over stone
Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone?

[Verse 5]
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerades of birds and bees
The petals, pink and white, the wind has blown
Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone?

[Bridge]
The trailing moss and mystic glow
The purple blossoms soft as snow
My tears keep flowing to the sea
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief
It takes a thief to catch a thief
For whom does the bell toll for, love?
It tolls for you and me

[Verse 6]
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
The yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan
Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone?

[Verse 1]
A worried man with a worried mind
No one in front of me and nothing behind
There’s a woman on my lap and she’s drinking champagne
Got white skin, got assassin’s eyes
I’m looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies
I’m well dressed, waiting on the last train
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose
Any minute now I’m expecting all hell to break loose

[Chorus]
People are crazy and times are strange
I’m locked in tight, I’m out of range
I used to care, but things have changed

[Verse 2]
This place ain’t doing me any good
I’m in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag
Ain’t no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag
Only a fool in here would think he’s got anything to prove
Lot of water under the bridge; lot of other stuff, too
Don’t get up, gentlemen, I’m only passing through

[Chorus]
People are crazy and times are strange
I’m locked in tight, I’m out of range
I used to care, but things have changed

[Verse 3]
I’ve been walking forty miles of bad road
If the Bible is right, the world will explode
I’ve been trying to get as far away from myself as I can
Some things are too hot to touch
The human mind can only stand so much
You can’t win with a losing hand
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet
Putting her in a wheelbarrow and wheeling her down the street

[Chorus]
People are crazy and times are strange
I’m locked in tight, I’m out of range
I used to care, but things have changed

[Verse 4]
I hurt easy, I just don’t show it
You can hurt someone and not even know it
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity
Gonna get low down, gonna fly high
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
I’m in love with a woman who don’t even appeal to me
Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy, they jumped in the lake
I’m not that eager to make a mistake

[Chorus]
People are crazy and times are strange
I’m locked in tight, I’m out of range
I used to care, but things have changed

[Verse 1]
Well, I’m stranded in the city that never sleeps
Some of these women they just give me the creeps
I’m avoidin’ the Southside the best I can
These memories I got, they can strangle a man

[Verse 2]
Well I came ashore in the dead of the night
Lot of things can get in the way when you’re tryin’ to do what’s right
You don’t understand it—my feelings for you
You’d be honest with me if only you knew

[Verse 3]
I’m not sorry for nothin’ I’ve done
I’m glad I fought—I only wish we’d won
The Siamese twins are comin’ to town
People can’t wait—they’re gathered around

[Verse 4]
When I left my home the sky split open wide
I never wanted to go back there—I’d rather have died
You don’t understand it—my feelings for you
You’d be honest with me if only you knew

[Verse 5]
My woman got a face like a teddy bear
She’s tossin’ a baseball bat in the air
The meat is so tough you can’t cut it with a sword
I’m crashin’ my car, trunk first into the boards

[Verse 6]
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice
Well, I’ll sell it to ya at a reduced price
You don’t understand it—my feelings for you
You’d be honest with me, if only you knew

[Verse 7]
Some things are too terrible to be true
I won’t come here no more if it bothers you
The Southern Pacific leaving me at nine forty-five
I’m having a hard time believin’ some people were ever alive

[Verse 8]
I’m stark naked, but I don’t care
I’m going off into the woods, I’m huntin’ bare
You don’t understand it—my feelings for you
Well, you’d be honest with me if only you knew

[Verse 9]
I’m here to create the new imperial empire
I’m going to do whatever circumstances require
I care so much for you—didn’t think that I could
I can’t tell my heart that you’re no good

[Verse 10]
Well, my parents they warned me not to waste my years
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears
You don’t understand it—my feelings for you
Well, you’d be honest with me if only you knew

[Verse 1]
Man comes to the door, I say, “For whom are you looking?”
He says, “Your wife,” I say, “She’s busy in the kitchen cooking”
Poor boy, where you been?
I already told you, won’t tell you again

[Verse 2]
I say, “How much you want for that?” I go into the store
The man says, “Three dollars.” “All right,” I say, “Will you take four?”
Poor boy, never say die
Things will be all right by and by

[Verse 3]
Been working on the mainline, working like the devil
The game is the same, it’s just up on a different level
Poor boy, dressed in black
Police at your back

[Verse 4]
Poor boy in a red hot town
Out beyond the twinkling stars
Riding first-class trains, making the rounds
Trying to keep from falling between the cars

[Verse 5]
Othello told Desdemona, “I’m cold, cover me with a blanket
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?”
She said, “I gave it to you, you drank it”
Poor boy, laying them straight, picking up the cherries falling off the plate

[Verse 6]
Time and love has branded me with its claws
Had to go to Florida, dodging them Georgia laws
Poor boy, in the hotel called the Palace of Gloom
Calls down to room service, says send up a room

[Verse 7]
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer
My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor
He did a lot of nice things for me and I won’t forget him

[Verse 8]
All I know is that I’m thrilled by your kiss
I don’t know any more than this
Poor boy, picking up sticks
Build you a house out of mortar and bricks

[Verse 9]
Knocking on the door, I say, “Who is it and where are you from?”
Man says, “Freddy!” I say, “Freddy who?” He says, “Freddy or not here I come”
Poor boy beneath the stars that shine
Washing them dishes, feeding them swine

[Verse 1]
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith
A nasty, dirty, double-crossin’, backstabbin’ phony I didn’t wanna have to be dealin’ with
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile
Well, I cried for you, now it’s your turn to cry awhile

[Verse 2]
I don’t carry deadweight, I’m no flash in the pan
All right, I’ll set you straight, can’t you see I’m a union man?
I’m lettin’ the cat out of the cage, I’m keeping a low profile
Well, I cried for you, now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile

[Verse 3]
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt
But the Pennsylvania line’s in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile
Well, I cried for you, now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile

[Verse 4]
Last night ’cross the alley there was a pounding on the walls
It must have been Don Pasqualli makin’ a two A.M. booty call
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style
Well, I cried for you, now it’s your turn to cry awhile

[Verse 5]
I’m on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can’t control
Some people they ain’t human, they got no heart or soul
Well, I’m crying to the Lord, I’m tryin’ to be meek and mild
Yes, I cried for you, now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile

[Verse 6]
Well, there’s preachers in the pulpits and babies in the cribs
I’m longin’ for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs
I’m gonna buy me a barrel of whiskey, I’ll die before I turn senile
Well, I cried for you, now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile

[Verse 7]
Well, you bet on a horse and it ran on the wrong way
I always said you’d be sorry and today could be the day
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial
Well, I cried for you, now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile

[Verse 1]
I got my back to the sun ’cause the light is too intense
I can see what everybody in the world is up against
You can’t turn back, you can’t come back, sometimes we push too far
One day you’ll open up your eyes and you’ll see where we are

[Chorus]
Sugar Baby get on down the road
You ain’t got no brains, no how
You went years without me
Might as well keep going now

[Verse 2]
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide ’em bad enough
I’m staying with Aunt Sally, but you know, she’s not really my aunt
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of them you can’t

[Chorus]
Sugar Baby get on down the line
You ain’t got no brains, no how
You went years without me
You might as well keep going now

[Verse 3]
The ladies down in Darktown, they’re doing the Darktown Strut
You always got to be prepared but you never know for what
There ain’t no limit to the amount of trouble women bring
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love’s not an evil thing

[Chorus]
Sugar Baby, get on down the road
You ain’t got no brains, no how
You went years without me
You might as well keep going now

[Verse 4]
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst
Try to make things better for someone, sometimes, you just end up making it a thousand times worse

[Chorus]
Sugar Baby, get on down the road
You ain’t got no brains, no how
You went years without me
Might as well keep going now

[Verse 5]
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one
You got a way of tearing the world apart. Love, see what you done
Just as sure as we’re living, just as sure as you’re born
Look up, look up, seek your Maker,’fore Gabriel blows his horn

[Chorus]
Sugar Baby, get on down the line
You ain’t got no sense, no how
You went years without me
Might as well keep going now

[Intro: Drake]
Ho, yeah, uh huh
It's Trey Songz and uh, D-R-A-K-K-E
Ahahaha, the boys of summer are here man
Ayo Trey, I got something mean for this one boy

[Verse 1: Drake]
Chances are most of the days you was lying around
I made money thats why these girls eyeing me down
By nineteen I might seem destined for millions
Promoters on my ass so I'm guessing they filled in
I take cues from my big boy Popz
I'm the only young dude that the big boys watch
They getting foul on the star
But it's all eyes on me like I'm copying some vows for the bar
Get it?
Guess not
Picture me not strive
To land in the top ten slip in the top five
Same thing in the top four trust I'm hot boy
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me?
Nowadays I peak they interests
Especially when life's bringing them pain and lately they been stressed
Money making brothers should take notes
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat
Somebody get the waiter
They need a second plate a this knowledge
If you ain't got it you could catch it later
My money and love is separate before I commit to date her
I put a split in the middle and learn to separate her

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Ridin' low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
Girl that's how it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't 'bout the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It ain't about the rims on my truck (No)
Ain't about the ice on my watch (No)
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game (It's about the game)
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch (No)
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game (Bout the game, uh)

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
When you ask why I hustle in the streets that's just who I be
Yo, I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin' free
Ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury
But without it all I'm still about the game

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
The haters wanna hate, but it ain't no thing no
Because the ladies choose to love me (cause they love me for what I do)

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game
It ain't about the shoes that I've got
Ain't about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game
It ain't about the shoes that I've got
Ain't about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Ridin' low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
Girl that's how it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't 'bout the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
The haters wanna hate, but it ain't no thing no
Because the ladies choose to love me (cause they love me for what I do)

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Drake]
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game
It ain't about the shoes that I've got
Ain't about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game
It ain't about the shoes that I've got
Ain't about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game (Southern smoke)

[Verse 1]
Thunder on the mountain, fires on the moon
There's a ruckus in the alley and the sun will be here soon
Today's the day, gonna grab my trombone and blow
Well, there's hot stuff here and it's everywhere I go

[Verse 2]
I was thinking' 'bout Alicia Keys, couldn't keep from crying
When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line
I'm wondering where in the world Alicia Keys could be
I have been looking for her even clear through Tennessee

[Verse 3]
Feel like my soul is beginning to expand
Look into my heart and you will sort of understand
You brought me here, now you're trying to run me away
The writing's on the wall, come read it, come see what it say

[Verse 4]
Thunder on the mountain, rolling like a drum
Gonna sleep over there, that's where the music coming from
I don't need any guide, I already know the way
Remember this, I'm your servant both night and day

[Verse 5]
The pistols are poppin' and the power is down
I'd like to try something' but I'm so far from town
The sun keeps shining'
And the North Wind keeps picking up speed
Gonna forget about myself for a while, gonna go out and see what others need

[Verse 6]
I've been sitting down studying the art of love
I think it will fit me like a glove
I want some real good woman to do just what I say
Everybody got to wonder
What's the matter with this cruel world today

[Verse 7]
Thunder on the mountain rolling to the ground
Gonna get up in the morning walk the hard road down
Some sweet day I'll stand beside my king
I wouldn't betray your love or any other thing

[Verse 8]
Gonna raise me an army, some tough sons of bitches
I'll recruit my army from the orphanages
I been to St. Herman's church and I've said my religious vows
I've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows

[Verse 9]
I got the porkchops, she got the pie
She ain't no angel and neither am I
Shame on your greed, shame on your wicked schemes
I'll say this, I don't give a damn about your dreams

[Verse 10]
Thunder on the mountain heavy as can be
Mean old twister bearing down on me
All the ladies of Washington scrambling to get out of town
Looks like something bad gonna happen
Better roll your airplane down

[Verse 11]
Everybody's going and I want to go too
Don't wanna take a chance with somebody new
I did all I could and I did it right there and then
I've already confessed, no need to confess again

[Verse 12]
Gonna make a lot of money, gonna go up north
I'll plant and I'll harvest what the earth brings forth
The hammer's on the table, the pitchfork's on the shelf
For the love of God, you ought to take pity on yourself

[Verse 1]
Spirit on the water
Darkness on the face of the deep
I keep thinking about you baby
I can't hardly sleep

[Verse 2]
I'm traveling by land
Traveling through the dawn of day
You're always on my mind
I can't stay away

[Verse 3]
I'd forgotten about you
Then you turned up again
I always knew
That we were meant to be more than friends

[Verse 4]
When you are near
It's just as plain as it can be
I'm wild about you, gal
You ought to be a fool about me

[Verse 5]
Can't explain
The sources of this hidden pain
You burned your way into my heart
You got the key to my brain

[Verse 6]
I've been trampling through mud
Praying to the powers above
I'm sweating blood
You got a face that begs for love

[Verse 7]
Life without you
Doesn't mean a thing to me
If I can't have you
I'll throw my love into the deep blue sea

[Verse 8]
Sometimes I wonder
Why you can't treat me right
You do good all day
Then you do wrong all night

[Verse 9]
When you're with me
I'm a thousand times happier than I could ever say
What does it matter
What price I pay

[Verse 10]
They brag about your sugar
Brag about it all over town
Put some sugar in my bowl
I feel like laying down

[Verse 11]
I'm pale as a ghost
Holding a blossom on a stem
You ever seen a ghost? No
But you have heard of them

[Verse 12]
I see you there
I'm blinded by the colors I see
I take good care
Of what belongs to me

[Verse 13]
I hear your name
Ringing up and down the line
I'm saying it plain
These ties are strong enough to bind

[Verse 14]
Your sweet voice
Calls out from some old familiar shrine
I got no choice
Can't believe these things would ever fade from your mind

[Verse 15]
I could live forever
With you perfectly
You don't ever
Have to make a fuss over me

[Verse 16]
From East to West
Ever since the world began
I only mean it for the best
I want to be with you any way I can

[Verse 17]
I been in a brawl
Now I'm feeling the wall
I'm going away baby
I won't be back ‘till fall

[Verse 18]
High on the hill
You can carry all my thoughts with you
You've numbed my will
This love could tear me in two

[Verse 19]
I wanna be with you in paradise
And it seems so unfair
I can't go to paradise no more
I killed a man back there

[Verse 20]
You think I'm over the hill
You think I'm past my prime
Let me see what you got
We can have a whoppin' good time

[Chorus]
Everyone from home
Says that you're so cool
Come on, everybody
Do the boarding school
Everyone from town
Says that you're so cool
Come on, get down
Do the boarding school

[Verse 1]
L-L-Let's do drugs
Make love with our teachers
Come on, date a townie
Let his tattoo'd ass beat ya
I'm a fan of pro-ana nation
I do them drugs to stop the f-food cravings
If you wanna get high with me
I'm in the back doin' crack, drinkin' p-p-pepsi

[Chorus]
Everyone from home
Says that you're so cool
Come on, everybody
Do the boarding school
Everyone from town
Says that you're so cool
Come on, get down
Do the boarding school

[Verse 2]
Cheap trailer trash and everyone knows it
But she got a great ass and she knows how to show it
With American flags on each little finger
You're crashing on Wall Street
While I'm blowing up as a singer

[Verse 3]
If you wanna get that scholarship
Yale's not a problem, let's solve it
Educated in the language of doin' it
Get down like your tutor taught you to
And do it

[Chorus]
Everyone from home
Says that you're so cool
Come on, everybody
Do the boarding school
Everyone from town
Says that you're so cool
Come on, get down
Do the boarding school

[Verse 4]
If you wanna get that sugar cane
If you wanna be that pin-up queen
You can, you can
If you wanna do that south beach swing
Or go on a groove, vacationing
You can, you can, you can

[Bridge]
When they said prolific, they weren't kidding
You thought that I was just a calender kitten
But now you heard me purring, tiger, you're smitten
So let's begin to major in the art of sinnin'

[Chorus]
Everyone from home
Says that you're so cool
Come on, everybody
Do the boarding school
Everyone from town
Says that you're so cool
Come on, get down
Do the boarding school

[Outro]
Get down, get down

[Verse 1]
I rolled and I tumbled, I cried the whole night long
I rolled and I tumbled, I cried the whole night long
Woke up this morning', I must have bet my money wrong

[Verse 2]
I got troubles so hard, I can't stand the strain
I got troubles so hard, I just can't stand the strain
Some young lazy slut has charmed away my brains

[Verse 3]
The landscape is glowing', gleaming' in the golden light of day
The landscape is glowing', gleaming' in the gold light of day
I am not holding nothing' back now, I am not standing' in anybody's way

[Verse 4]
Well, I did all I know just to keep you off my mind
Well, I did all I know just to keep you off my mind
Well, I paid and I paid and my suffering' heart is always on the line

[Verse 5]
Well, I get up in the dawn and I go down and lay in the shade
I get up in the dawn and I go down and lay in the shade
I ain't nobody's house boy, I ain't nobody's well trained maid

[Verse 6]
I'm flat-out spent, this woman has been driving' me to tears
I'm flat-out spent, this woman she has been driving' me to tears
This woman so crazy, I swear I ain't gonna touch another one for years

[Verse 7]
Well, the warm weather is coming' and the buds are on the vine
The warm weather's comin', the buds are on the vine
Ain't nothing so depressing as trying to satisfy this woman of mine

[Verse 8]
I got up this morning', saw the rising sun return
Well, I got up this morning', seen the rising sun return
Sooner or later you too shall burn

[Verse 9]
The night's filled with shadows, the years are filled with early doom
The night's filled with shadows, the years are filled with early doom
I've been conjuring up all these long dead souls from their crumbling' tombs

[Verse 10]
Let's forgive each other darling', let's go down to the greenwood glen
Let's forgive each other darling', let's go down to the greenwood glen
Let's put our heads together, let's put old matters to an end

[Verse 11]
Now I rolled and I tumbled and I cried the whole night long
Ah, I rolled and I tumbled, I cried the whole night long
I woke up this morning, I think I must be traveling' wrong

[Verse 1]
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light
Where wisdom grows up in strife
My bewildering brain, toils in vain
Through the darkness on the pathways of life
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air
Tomorrow keeps turning around
We live and we die, we know not why
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down

[Verse 2]
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think
Far down the street we stray
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
Things I never meant nor wished to say
The midnight rain follows the train
We all wear the same thorny crown
Soul to soul, our shadows roll
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down

[Verse 3]
The moon gives light and shines by night
I scarcely feel the glow
We learn to live and then we forgive
O'er the road we're bound to go
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
That keep us so tightly bound
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down

[Verse 4]
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes
I followed the winding stream
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys
I know they're not what they seem
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
You'll never see me frown
I owe my heart to you, and that's saying' it true
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down

[Verse 1]
I don't care what you do, I don't care what you say
I don't care where you go or how long you stay
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

[Verse 2]
Well you take my money and you turn me out
You fill me up with nothing but self doubt
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me anymore

[Verse 3]
When I was young, driving was my crave
You drive me so hard, almost to the grave
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me anymore

[Verse 4]
I'm so hard pressed, my mind tied up in knots
I keep recycling the same old thoughts
Someday baby you ain't gonna worry po' me anymore

[Verse 5]
So many good things in life that I overlooked
I don't know what to do now, baby you got me so hooked
Someday baby you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

[Verse 6]
Well, I don't want to brag, I'm gonna ring your neck
When all else fails I'll make it a matter of self-respect
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

[Verse 7]
You can take your clothes put em in a sack
You goin' down the road, baby and you can't come back
Someday baby you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

[Verse 8]
I tried to be friendly, I tried to be kind
I'm gonna drive you from your home, just like I was driven from mine
Someday baby you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

[Verse 9]
Living this way ain't a natural thing to do
Why was I born to love you?
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

[Verse 1]
The jingle bells are jingling
The streets are white with snow
The happy crowds are mingling
But there's no one that I know

I'm sure that you'll forgive me
If I don't enthuse
I guess I got the Christmas blues

[Verse 2]
I've done my window shopping
There's not a store I missed
But what's the use of stoppin'
When there's no one on your list

You'll know the way I'm feeling
When you love and you lose
I guess I've got the Christmas blues

[Verse 3]
When somebody wants you
Somebody needs you
Christmas is a joy of joys
But friends, when you're lonely
You'll find that it's only
A thing for little girls and little boys

[Verse 4]
May all your days be merry
Your seasons full of cheer
But till it's January
I'll just go and disappear

[Verse 5]
Old Santa may have brought you
Some stars for your shoes
But Santa only brought me the blues
Those brightly packaged
Tinsel covered Christmas blues

[Verse 6]
Old Santa may have brought you
Some stars for your shoes
But Santa only brought me the blues
Those brightly packaged
Tinsel covered Christmas blues

[Verse 1]
Well you're coming down High Street, walking in the sun
You make the dead man rise, and holler she's the one
Jolene, Jolene
Baby, I am the king and you're the queen

[Verse 2]
Well it's a long old highway, don't ever end
I've got a Saturday night special, I'm back again
I'll sleep by your door, lay my life on the line
You probably don't know, but I'm going to make you mine
Jolene, Jolene
Baby, I am the king and you're the queen

[Verse 3]
I keep my hands in my pocket, I'm moving along
People think they know, but they're all wrong
You're something nice, I'm going to grab my dice
I can't say I haven't paid the price
Jolene, Jolene
Baby I am the king and you're the queen

[Verse 4]
Well I found out the hard way, I've had my fill
You can't find somebody with his back to a hill
Those big brown eyes, they set off a spark
When you hold me in your arms things don't look so dark
Jolene, Jolene
Baby I am the king and you're the queen

[Verse 1: Bob Dylan & Joan Baez]
The water is wide and I can't cross over
Build me wings and I could fly
Build me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row my love and I

[Verse 2: Bob Dylan & Joan Baez]
There is a ship and it sails on the sea
Loaded deep as deep can be
But not as deep as the love I'm in
I know not if I sink or swim

[Verse 3: Bob Dylan & Joan Baez]
I leaned my back up against an oak
Thinking it was a trusty tree
But first it bent and then it broke
Just like my own false love to me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5: Bob Dylan & Joan Baez]
Oh love is gentle, love is kind
Gay as a jewel when first it's new
But love grows old and waxes cold
And fades away like some morning dew

[Verse 6: Bob Dylan & Joan Baez]
The water is wide and I can't cross over
Neither have I wings that I could fly
Build me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row my love and I

[Hook]
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
I blow bands, I blow bands

[Verse 1]
I'm the man, I'm the man, my whole team blow bands
Blow bands, yeah, blow bands
I'm the man, I'm the man, I be rolling off them Xan's (off the Xan's)
I be rolling off them Xan's, I'm the man

[Hook]
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
Blowing bands, blowing bands, I'm the man
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
Blowing bands, go, go, go, I'm the man

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I cashed out this year (cash out)
The top on my car, it just disappeared (poof)
My engine sittin' in the rear (zoom)
If you ain't getting cash, fuck up outta here (go)
Young Soulja, this my year (what?)
Candy-paint the Range Rover and the (?)
Two chains got me feeling great
Hoppin' out the foreign whip to a new estate (damn)
My ring looking icy now
I'm hoppin' out the whip, they screamin Soulja on
Those bricks touch down, then they gone
If you need a verse nigga, hit me on my phone
They know that I'm the man, I'm the man
Blowing bands, blowing bands, blowing it like a fan
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
I'm blowing kush, sippin' lean, rolling off them Xan's

[Hook]
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
Blowing bands, blowing bands, I'm the man
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
Blowing bands, rolling off them Xan's
I'm the man, I'm the man (turn up)
I'm the man, I'm the man (x3)

[Verse 3]
Red bottom walking, I'm the man (red bottom)
Up inside the versace store, a whole lotta bag
A whole lotta Gucci (?) on the tag (damn)
Nigga need rags, you can add it to my tab
Rolling off of poper and she on the lower tap
Hoppin' out the foreign, you know Soulja get cash
I splash, in my whip there's dizzy da dash (x2)
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm blowing bands
Just like a copper
I'm in the club and my brother brought the chopper
I'm rolling off of bean, and a yopper
A yopper
I'm the man

[Verse 1: Joan Baez]
Don't sing love songs, you'll wake my mother
She's sleeping here, right by my side
And in her right hand, a silver dagger
She says that I can't be your bride

[Verse 2: Joan Baez]
All men are false, says my mother
They'll tell you wicked, loving lies
The very next evening, they'll court another
Leave you alone to pine and sigh

[Verse 3: Joan Baez]
My daddy is a handsome devil
He's got a chain five miles long
And on every link a heart does dangle
Of another maid he's loved and wronged

[Verse 4: Joan Baez]
Go court another tender maiden
And hope that she will be your wife
For I've been warned and I've decided
To sleep alone all of my life

[Verse 1]
How long can I stay in this nowhere café
Before night turns into day
I wonder why I'm so frightened of dawn
All I have and all I know
Is this dream of you
Which keeps me living on

[Verse 2]
There's a moment when all old things
Become new again
But that moment might have come and gone
All I have and all I know
Is this dream of you
Which keeps me living on

[Verse 3]
I look away, but I keep seeing it
I don't want to believe, but I keep believing it
Shadows dance upon the wall
Shadows that seem to know it all

[Verse 4]
Am I too blind to see, is my heart playing tricks on me
I'm lost in the crowd
All my tears are gone
All I have and all I know
Is this dream of you
Which keeps me living on

[Verse 5]
Everything I touch seems to disappear
Everywhere I turn you are always here
I'll run this race until my earthly death
I'll defend this place with my dying breath

[Verse 6]
From a cheerless room in a curtained gloom
I saw a star from heaven fall
I turned and looked again but it was gone
All I have and all I know
Is this dream of you
Which keeps me living on

[Verse 1]
Well I got trouble
Trouble's on my mind
Yep, when I got in trouble
Trouble's on my mind
Well, I'm going to forget my trouble
Leave my trouble behind, behind

[Verse 2]
I'm going to swing it up
Swing it down
Got the fever, then wham, wham wham!

[Verse 3]
Well, swing your troubles
Swing your troubles away
Yeah, well, swing baby
Swing your troubles today

[Outro]
Yea, yea, yea, yeah!
As I went walking that ribbon of highway
I saw above me that endless skyway
I saw below me that golden valley
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land, this land is my land
From California to the New York Island
From the redwood forest to the gulf stream waters
This land was made for you and me

I've roamed and rambled, and I've followed my footsteps
To the sunny bright sands of her diamond deserts
And all around me a voice came singing
Singing this land was made for you and me

This land is your land, this land is my land
From California to the New York Island
From the redwood forest to the gulf stream waters
This land was made for you and me

It was early one morning as I was strolling
The wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling
As the fog was lifting a voice come chanting
This land was made for you and me
This land is your land, this land is my land
From California to the New York Island
From the redwood forest to the gulf stream waters
This land was made for you and me

Nobody living can ever stop me
As I go walkin' my freedom highway
Nobody living can make me turn back
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land, this land is my land
From California to the New York Island
From the redwood forest to the gulf stream waters
This land was made for you and me

[Verse 1]
Sad I’m a-sittin’ on the railroad track
Watching’ that old smokestack
Train is a-leavin’ but it won’t be back

[Verse 2]
Years ago we hang around
Watching’ trains roll through the town
Now that train is a-graveyard bound

[Verse 3]
Where we go up in that North Country
Lakes and streams and mines so free
I had no better friend than he

[Verse 4]
Something happened to him that day
I thought I heard a stranger say
I hung my head and stole away

[Verse 5]
A diesel truck was headin’ down
Carryin' up a heavy load
Left him on a Utah road

[Verse 6]
They carried him back to his hometown
His mother cried, his sister moaned
Listening’ to them church bells tone

[Verse 7]
A diesel truck was rollin' slow
Pullin' down a heavy load
It left him on a Utah road

[Outro]
I-I sung the last verse for ya because I missed the words the first time I sung them about the truck

[Verse 1]
If I had wings
Like Noah's Dove
I’d fly the river
To the one I love
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

[Verse 2]
I had a man
Who was long and tall
Moved his body
Like a cannonball
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

[Verse 3]
Remember one evening
Was drizzling rain
And around my heart
I felt an aching pain
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

[Verse 4]
Once I wore
My apron low
Couldn’t keep you
Away from my door
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

[Verse 5]
Now my apron
Is up to my chin
You pass my door
But you never come in
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

[Verse 6]
Oh, mighty river
Runs muddy and wild
Can’t care the bloody
For my unborn child
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

[Verse 7]
Number 9 train
Won’t do no harm
Number 9 train
Take my poor baby home
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

[Verse 8]
Fastest man
I ever saw
Skipped Missouri
On the way to Arkansas
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

[Verse 1]
I’m a rambler, I’m a gambler
I’m a long way from my home
If the people don’t like me
They can leave me alone

[Verse 2]
Come sit down beside me
Come sit down right here
Come sit down, love, I want you
Love you boldly, so dear

[Verse 3]
When you get to Wyoming
A letter you’ll see
If you get into trouble
Just you write and tell me

[Verse 4]
For I once had a lover
Her age was sixteen
She’s a flower of velvet and the rose of Celine

[Verse 5]
Her parents was against me
Now she is the same
If I write on your book, love
Just you blot out my name

[Outro]
Oh there’s changes in the ocean
There’s changes in the sea
There’s changes in my true love
There's no change in me

[Chorus]
I was young when I left home
But I been out a-rambling around
And I never wrote a letter to my home
To my home, Lord, to my home
And I never wrote a letter to my home

[Verse 1]
It was just the other day
I was bringing home my pay
When I met an old friend I used to know

[Verse 2]
Said your mother’s dead and gone
Baby sister’s all gone wrong
And your daddy needs you home right away

[Verse 3]
Not a shirt on my back
Not a penny on my name
Well I can’t go home Thisaway
Thisaway, Lord, Lord, Lord
And I can’t go home Thisaway

[Verse 4]
If you miss the train I’m on
Count the days I’m gone
You will hear that whistle blow a hundred miles
A hundred miles, honey baby. Lord Lord Lord
And you’ll hear that whistle blow a hundred miles

[Verse 5]
I’m playing on a track
Ma would come and whoop me back
On them trestles down by old Jim McKay’s

[Verse 6]
When I pay the debt I owe
To the commissary store
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home
Go home, Lord Lord Lord
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home

[Verse 7]
Used to tell Ma sometimes
When I see them riding blinds
Going to make me a home out in the wind
In the wind, Lord in the wind
Make me a home out in the wind

[Verse 8]
I don’t like it in the wind
Want to go back home again
But I can’t go home Thisaway
Thisaway, Lord Lord Lord
And I can’t go home Thisaway

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Well, I’m going to get you Sally girl
I’m going to get you Sally girl
I’m going to get you Sally girl
I’m going to get you Sally gal

[Verse 2]
I’m just one of them rambling men
Ramblin’ since I don’t know when
Here I come and I’m a-gone again
Sally says I got no end

[Outro]
I’m going to get you Sally girl
I’m going to get you Sally girl
I’m going to get you Sally girl
I’m going to get you Sally girl

[Verse 1]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year
All our troubles will be out of sight

[Verse 2]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the yuletide gay
Next year
All our troubles will be miles away

[Verse 3]
Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us once more

[Verse 4]
Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then
We'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now

[Verse 2]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the yuletide gay
Next year
All our troubles will be miles away

[Verse 3]
Once again as in olden days
Happy gold days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us once more

[Verse 4]
Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star
Upon the highest bow
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
(Have yourself a merry little Christmas now)

[Intro]
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
Everybody saying this is a day only the Lord could make

[Verse 1]
Well I worked on the levee Mama, both night and day
Well I worked on the levee Mama, both night and day
I got to the river and I threw my clothes away

I paid my time and now I'm as good as new
I paid my time and now I'm as good as new
They can't take me back, not unless I want them to

[Verse 2]
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
Some of these people gonna strip you of all they can take

I can't stop here, I ain't ready to unload
I can't stop here, I ain't ready to unload
Riches and salvation can be waiting
Behind the next bend in the road

[Verse 3]
I picked you up from the gutter and this is the thanks I get
I picked you up from the gutter and this is the thanks I get
You say you want me to quit ya, I told you no, not just yet

I look in your eyes, I see nobody else but me
I look in your eyes, I see nobody other than me
I see all that I am and all I hope to be

[Verse 4]
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
Some of these people don't know which road to take

When I'm with you I forget I was ever blue
When I'm with you I forget I was ever blue
Without you there's no meaning in anything I do

[Verse 5]
Some people on the road carrying everything that they own
Some people on the road carrying everything that they own
Some people got barely enough skin to cover their bones

Put on your cat clothes, Mama, put on your evening dress
Put on your cat clothes, Mama, put on your evening dress
A few more years of hard work
Then there'll be a thousand years of happiness

[Verse 6]
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
I tried to get you to love me, but I won't repeat that mistake

If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
Plenty of cheap stuff out there still around that you take

[Verse 7]
I woke up this morning, butter and eggs in my bed
I woke up this morning, butter and eggs in my bed
I ain't got enough room to even raise my head

Come back, baby, say we never more will part
Come back, baby, say we never more will part
Don't be a stranger without a brain or heart

[Outro]
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
Some people still sleeping', some people are wide awake

[Verse 1]
There's an evening' haze settlin' over the town
Starlight by the edge of the creek
The buyin' power of the proletariat's gone down
Money's gettin' shallow and weak
The place I love best is a sweet memory
It's a new path that we trod
They say low wages are a reality
If we want to compete abroad

[Verse 2]
My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf
Come sit down on my knee
You are dearer to me than myself
As you yourself can see
I'm listening' to the steel rails hum
Got both eyes tight shut
Just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from
Creeping it's way into my gut

[Chorus]
Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues

[Verse 3]
Now, I'm sailing' on back, ready for the long haul
Tossed by the winds and the seas
I'll drag them all down to hell and I'll stand them at the wall
I'll sell them to their enemies
I'm trying' to feed my soul with thought
Gonna sleep off the rest of the day
Sometimes no one wants what we got
Sometimes you can't give it away

[Verse 4]
Now the place is ringed with countless foes
Some of them may be deaf and dumb
No man, no woman knows
The hour that sorrow will come
In the dark I hear the night birds call
I can hear a lover's breath
I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall
Sleep is like a temporary death

[Chorus]
Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues

[Verse 5]
Well, they burned my barn, they stole my horse
I can't save a dime
I got to be careful, I don't want to be forced
Into a life of continual crime
I can see for myself that the sun is sinking
How I wish you were here to see
Tell me now, am I wrong in thinking
That you have forgotten me?

[Verse 6]
Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret
They waste your nights and days
Them I will forget
But you I'll remember always
Old memories of you to me have clung
You've wounded me with words
Gonna have to straighten out your tongue
It's all true, everything you have heard

[Chorus]
Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues

[Verse 7]
In you, my friend, I find no blame
Wanna look in my eyes, please do
No one can ever claim
That I took up arms against you
All across the peaceful sacred fields
They will lay you low
They'll break your horns and slash you with steel
I say it so it must be so

[Verse 8]
Now I'm down on my luck and I'm black and blue
Gonna give you another chance
I'm all alone and I'm expecting you
To lead me off in a cheerful dance
Got a brand new suit and a brand new wife
I can live on rice and beans
Some people never worked a day in their life
Don't know what work even means

[Chorus]
Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues

[Intro]
Beyond the horizon, behind the sun
At the end of the rainbow life has only begun
In the long hours of twilight 'neath the stardust above
Beyond the horizon it is easy to love

[Verse 1]
My wretched heart's pounding
I felt an angel's kiss
My memories are drowning
In mortal bliss

Beyond the horizon, in the Springtime or Fall
Love waits forever for one and for all

[Verse 2]
Beyond the horizon across the divide
'Round about midnight, we'll be on the same side
Down in the valley the water runs cold
Beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul

[Verse 3]
I'm touched with desire
What don't I do?
I'll throw the logs on the fire
I'll build my world around you

Beyond the horizon, at the end of the game
Every step that you take, I'm walking the same

[Verse 4]
Beyond the horizon the night winds blow
The theme of a melody from many moons ago
The bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime
Beyond the horizon I found you just in time

[Verse 5]
It's dark and it's dreary
I ponder in vain
I'm weakened, I'm weary
My repentance is plain

Beyond the horizon o'er the treacherous sea
I still can't believe that you've set aside your love for me

[Verse 6]
Beyond the horizon, 'neath crimson skies
In the soft light of morning I'll follow you with my eyes
Through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone
Beyond the horizon right down to the bone

[Verse 7]
It's late in the season
Never knew, never cared
Whatever the reason
Someone's life has been spared

[Outro]
Beyond the horizon the sky is so blue
I've got more than a lifetime to live lovin' you

[Verse 1]
Lost John sitting on a railroad track
Something's out of whack
Blues this morning falling down like hail
Gonna leave a greasy trail

[Verse 2]
Gonna travel the world is what I'm gonna do
Then come back and see you
All I ever do is struggle and strive
If I don't do anybody any harm, I might make it back home alive

[Verse 3]
I'm the oldest son of a crazy man
I'm in a cowboy band
Got a pile of sins to pay for and I ain't got time to hide
I'd walk through a blazing fire, baby, if I knew you was on the other side

[Chorus]
Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore
And my happiness is o'er
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise
I loved you then and ever shall
But there's no one here left to tell
The world has gone black before my eyes

[Verse 4]
The world of research has gone berserk
Too much paperwork
Albert's in the graveyard, Frankie's raising hell
I'm beginning to believe what the scriptures tell

[Verse 5]
I'm going where the Southern crosses the Yellow Dog
Get away from these demagogues
And these bad luck women stick like glue
It's either one or the other or neither of the two

[Verse 6]
She says, "look out daddy, don't want you to tear your pants
You can get wrecked in this dance."
They say whiskey will kill ya, but I don't think it will
I'm riding with you to the top of the hill

[Chorus]
Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore
And my happiness is o'er
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise
I loved you then and ever shall
But there's no one here left to tell
The world has gone black before my eyes

[Verse 7]
Don't know why my baby never looked so good before
I don't have to wonder no more
She been cooking all day and it's gonna take me all night
I can't eat all that stuff in a single bite

[Verse 8]
The Judge is coming in, everybody rise
Lift up your eyes
You can do what you please, you don't need my advice
Before you call me any dirty names you better think twice

[Verse 9]
Getting light outside, the temperature dropped
I think the rain has stopped
I'm going to make you come to grips with fate
When I'm through with you, you'll learn to keep your business straight

[Chorus]
Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore
And my happiness is o'er
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise
I loved you then and ever shall
But there's no one here left to tell
The world has gone black before my eyes

[Verse 10]
The bright spark of the steady lights
Has dimmed my sights
When you're around all my grief gives 'way
A lifetime with you is like some heavenly day

[Verse 11]
Everything I've ever known to be right has been proven wrong
I'll be drifting along
The woman I'm a-loving, she rules my heart
No knife could ever cut our love apart

[Verse 12]
Today I'll stand in faith and raise
The voice of praise
The sun is strong, I'm standing in the light
I wish to God that it were night

[Chorus]
Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore
And my happiness is o'er
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise
I loved you then and ever shall
But there's no one here left to tell
The world has gone black before my eyes

[Verse 1]
As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden
The wounded flowers were danglin' from the vine
I was passin' by yon cool and crystal fountain
Someone hit me from behind

[Verse 2]
Ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
Through this weary world of woe
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
No one on earth would ever know

[Verse 3]
They say prayer has the power to help
So pray from the mother
In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell
I'm a'tryin' to love my neighbor and do good unto others
But oh, mother, things ain't goin' well

[Verse 4]
Ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
I'll burn that bridge before you can cross
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
They'll be no mercy for ya' once you've lost

[Verse 5]
Now I'm all worn down by weepin'
My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry
If I catch my opponents ever sleepin'
I'll just slaughter them where they lie

[Verse 6]
Ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
Through the world mysterious and vague
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Walkin' a'through the cities of the plague

[Verse 7]
Well, the whole world is filled with speculation
The whole wide world which people say is round
They will tear your mind away from contemplation
They will jump on your misfortune when you're down

[Verse 8]
Ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
Eatin' hog-eyed grease in a hog-eyed town
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Someday you'll be glad to have me around

[Verse 9]
They will crush you with wealth and power
Every wakin' moment you could crack
I'll make the most of one last extra hour
I'll avenge my father's death an' I'll step back

[Verse 10]
Ain't talkin', just walkin'
Hand me down my walkin' cane
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Got to get ya' out of my miserable brain

[Verse 11]
All o' my loyal and much-loved companions
They approve of me and share my code
I practice a faith that's been long abandoned
Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road

[Verse 12]
Ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
My mule is sick, my horse is blind
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Thinkin' ‘bout that gal I left behind

[Verse 13]
Well, it's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flyin'
Fame and honor never seem to fade
The fire gone out but the light is never dyin'
Who says I can't get heavenly aid?

[Verse 14]
Ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
Carryin' a dead man's shield
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
A'walkin' a'with a toothache in my heel

[Verse 15]
The sufferin' is unending
Every nook and cranny has its tears
I'm a'not playin', I'm not pretending
I'm not nursin' any superfluous fears

[Verse 16]
Ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
Walkin' ever since the other night
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Walkin' ‘til I'ma clean outta sight

[Verse 17]
As I walked out in the mystic garden
On a hot summer day, a hot summer lawn
"Excuse me, ma'am, I beg your pardon
There's no one here, the gardener is gone"

[Verse 18]
Ain't talkin', a'just a'walkin'
Up the road around the bend
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
In the last outback, at the world's end

[Verse 1]
Oh, well, I love ya pretty baby
You're the only love I've ever known
Just as long as you stay with me
The whole world is my throne

[Refrain]
Beyond here lies nothin
Nothin we can call our own

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm moving after midnight
Down boulevards of broken cars
Don't know what I'd do without it
Without this love that we call ours

[Refrain]
Beyond here lies nothin
Nothin but the moon and stars

[Verse 3]
Down every street there's a window
And every window made of glass
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby
For as long as love will last

[Refrain]
Beyond here lies nothin
But the mountains of the past

[Verse 4]
Well, my ship is in the harbor
And the sails are spread
Listen to me, pretty baby
Lay your hand upon my head

[Refrain]
Beyond here lies nothin
Nothin done, and nothin said

[Intro]
The light in this place is really bad
Like being at the bottom of a stream
Any minute now
I’m expecting to wake up from a dream

[Verse 1]
Means so much, the softest touch
By the grave of some child, who neither wept or smiled
I pondered my faith in the rain
I’ve been dreaming’ of you, that’s all I do
And it’s driving me insane

[Verse 2]
Somewhere dawn is breaking
Light is streaking across the floor
Church bells are ringing
I wonder who they’re ringing for

[Verse 3]
Travel under any star
You’ll see me wherever you are
The shadowy past is awake and so vast
I’m sleeping in the palace of pain
I’ve been dreaming’ of you, that’s all I do
But it’s driving me insane

[Verse 4]
Maybe they’ll get me, maybe they won’t
But whatever it won’t be tonight
I wish your hand was in mine right now
We could go where the moon is white

[Verse 5]
For years they had me locked in a cage
Then they threw me onto the stage
Some things just last longer than you thought they would
And they never, ever explain
I’ve been dreaming’ of you, that’s all I do
And it’s driving me insane

[Verse 6]
Well, I eat when I’m hungry, drink when I’m dry
Live my life on the square
Even if the flesh falls off my face
It won’t matter, long as you’re there

[Verse 7]
Feel like a ghost in love
Underneath the heavens above
Feel further away than I ever did before
Feel further than I can take
Dreaming’ of you is all I do
But it’s driving me insane

[Verse 8]
Everything in the way is so shiny today
A queer and unusual fall
Spirals of golden haze, here and there in a blaze
Like beams of light in the storm

[Verse 9]
Maybe you were here and maybe you weren’t
Maybe you touched somebody and got burnt
The silent sun has got me on the run
Burning a hole in my brain
I’m dreaming’ of you, that’s all I do
But it’s driving me insane

[Verse 1]
Well I wandered alone through a desert of stone
And I dreamt of my future wife
My sword's in my hand and I'm next in command
In this version of death called life
My plate and my cup are right straight up
I took a rose from the hand of a child
When I kiss your lips, the honey drips
But I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

[Verse 2]
Every day we meet on any old street
And you're in your girlish prime
The short and the tall are coming to the ball
I go there all the time
Behind every tree, there's something to see
The river is wider than a mile
I tried you twice, you can't be nice
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

[Verse 3]
Here come the nurse with money in her purse
Here come the ladies and men
You push it all in and you've no chance to win
You play 'em on down to the end
I'm laying in the sand getting a sunshine tan
Moving along riding in style
From my toes to my head, you knock me dead
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

[Verse 4]
I count the years and I shed no tears
I'm blinded to what might have been
Nature's voice makes my heart rejoice
Play me the wild song of the wind
I found hopeless love in the room above
When the sun and the weather were mild
You're as fine as wine, I ain't handing you no line
But I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

[Verse 5]
All the merry little elves can go hang themselves
My faith is as cold as can be
I'm stacked high to the roof and I'm not without proof
If you don't believe me, come see
You think I'm blue, I think so too
In my words, you'll find no guile
The game's gotten old, the deck's gone cold
And I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

[Outro]
The game's gotten old, the deck's gone cold
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

[Verse 1]
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer
Are pulling on the reins

Bells are ringing, children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings, say your prayers
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

[Verse 2]
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus lane
He's got a bag that is filled with toys
For boys and girls again

Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle
What a beautiful sight
So jump in bed, cover your head
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

[Verse 3]
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
He doesn't care if you're rich or poor
For he loves you just the same

Santa Claus knows that we're God's children
That makes everything right
Fill your hearts with the Christmas cheer
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

[Verse 4]
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
He'll come around when the chimes ring out
When it's Christmas morn again

Peace on earth will come to all
If we just follow the light
Fill your hearts with Christmas cheer
'Cause Santa Clause comes tonight

[Outro]
Peace on earth will come to all
If we just follow the light
Let's give thanks to the Lord above
'Cause Santa Clause comes tonight
'Cause Santa Clause comes tonight
Let's give thanks to the Lord above
'Cause Santa Clause comes tonight
Tonight, tonight

[Verse 1]
Said the night wind to the little lamb
"Do you see what I see?
Way up in the sky, little lamb
Do you see what I see?
A star, a star, dancin' in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite"

[Verse 2]
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
"Do you hear what I hear?
Ringin' through the sky, shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear?
A song, a song, high above the tree
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea"

[Verse 3]
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
"Do you know what I know?
In your palace warm, mighty king
Do you know what I know?
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold
Let us bring Him silver and gold
Let us bring Him silver and gold"

[Verse 4]
Said the king to the people everywhere
"Listen to what I say
Pray for peace, people everywhere
Listen to what I say
A Child, a Child, sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light"

[Intro]
(Wonderland)
(Winter wonderland)
(Wonderland)

[Verse 1]
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

[Verse 2]
Gone away is a bluebird
In his place is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

[Verse 3]
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?" We'll say, "No, man"
But you can do the job when you're in town

[Verse 4]
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

[Verse 5]
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kids all knock him down

[Verse 6]
When it snows, ain't it thrillin'
Though your nose gets a chillin'
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland
(Ooh)

[Verse 1]
Hark! The herald angels sing
"Glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled

Joyful, all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic host proclaim
"Christ is born in Bethlehem!"
Hark! The herald angels sing
"Glory to the newborn King!"

[Verse 2]
Hark! The herald angels sing
"Glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled

Joyful, all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic host proclaim
"Christ is born in Bethlehem!"
Hark! The herald angels sing
"Glory to the newborn King!"

[Verse 1]
I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

[Verse 2]
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

[Verse 3]
I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

[Verse 4]
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

[Verse 1]
Come they told me, pa rum pum pum pum
A new born King to see, pa rum pum pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pum pum pum
To lay before the King, pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
And so to honor Him, pa rum pum pum pum
When we come

[Verse 2]
Little baby, pa rum pum pum pum
I am a poor boy too, pa rum pum pum pum
I have no gift to bring, pa rum pum pum pum
That's fit to give a King, pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Shall I play for you, pa rum pum pum
On my drum
On my drum

[Verse 3]
Mary nodded, pa rum pum pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pum pum pum
I played my drum for Him, pa rum pum pum
I played my best for Him, pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Then He smiled at me, pa rum pum pum pum
Me and my drum
Me and my drum

[Verse 1]
Well I didn't come here to deal with a dog gone thing
I just came here to hear the drummer's cymbal ring
There is no way you can put me down
I just want to say that Hell's my wife's home town

[Verse 2]
Well there's reasons for that and reasons for this
I can't think of any just now, but I know they exist
I'm sitting in the sun till my skin turns brown
I just want to say that Hell's my wife's home town
Home town, home town

[Verse 3]
She can make you steal, make you rob
Give you the hives, make you lose your job
Make things bad, she can make things worse
She got stuff more potent than a gypsy curse

[Verse 4]
One of these days, I'll end up on the run
I'm pretty sure, she'll make me kill someone
I'm going inside, roll the shutters down
I just want to say that Hell's my wife's home town

[Verse 5]
Well there's plenty to remember, plenty to forget
I still can remember the day we met
I lost my reason long ago
My love for her is all I know

[Verse 6]
State gone broke, the county's dry
Don't be looking at me, with that evil eye
Keep on walking don't be hanging around
I'm telling you again that Hell's my wife's home town
Home town, home town

[Verse 1]
If you ever go to Houston
Better walk right
Keep your hands in your pockets
And your gun-belt tight
You'll be asking for trouble
If you're looking for a fight
If you ever go to Houston
Boy, you better walk right

[Verse 2]
If you're ever down there
On Bagby and Lamar
You better watch out for
The man with the shining star
Better know where you're going
Or stay where you are
If you're ever down there
On Bagby and Lamar

[Verse 3]
I know these streets
I've been here before
I nearly got killed here
During the Mexican war
Something always
Keeps me coming back for more
I know these streets
I've been here before

[Verse 4]
If you ever go to Dallas
Say hello to Mary Anne
Say I'm still pulling on the trigger
Hanging on the best I can
If you see her sister Lucy
Say I'm sorry I'm not there
Tell her other sister Betsy
To pray the sinner's prayer

[Verse 5]
I got a restless fever
Burning in my brain
Got to keep riding forward
Can't spoil the game
The same way I leave here
Will be the way that I came
Got a restless fever
Burning in my brain

[Verse 6]
Mr. Policeman
Can you help me find my girl
Last time I saw her
Was at the Magnolia Hotel
If you help me find her
You can be my pal
Mr. Policeman
Can you help me find my girl

[Verse 7]
If you ever go to Austin
Fort Worth or San Antone
Find the bar rooms I got lost in
And send my memories home
Put my tears in a bottle
Screw the top on tight
If you ever go to Houston
You better walk right

[Verse 1]
Adeste fideles, laeti triumphantes
Venite, venite in Bethlehem
Natum videte
Regem angelorum

Venite, adoremus
Venite, adoremus
Venite, adoramus
Dominum

[Verse 2]
O' come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
Oo come ye, o' come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of angels

O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ, the Lord

[Verse 3]
Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation
Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above
Glory to God
In the highest

O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ, the Lord

[Verse 1]
Forgetful heart
Lost your power of recall
Every little detail
You don't remember at all
The times we knew
Who would remember better than you

[Verse 2]
Forgetful heart
We laughed and had a good time you and I
It's been so long
Now you're content to let the days go by
When you were there
You were the answer to my prayer

[Verse 3]
Forgetful heart
We loved with all the love that life can give
What can I say
Without you it's so hard to live
Can't take much more
Why can't we love like we did before

[Verse 4]
Forgetful heart
Like a walking shadow in my brain
All night long
I lay awake and listen to the sound of pain
The door has closed forevermore
If indeed there ever was a door

[Verse 1]
I get the blues for you, baby, when I look up at the sun
I get the blues for you, baby, when I look up at the sun
Come back here, we can have some real fun

[Verse 2]
Well, it's early in the evening, and everything is still
Well, it's early in the evening, and everything is still
One more time, I'm walking up on heartbreak hill

[Chorus]
Shake, shake, mama; like a ship going out to sea
Shake, shake, mama; like a ship going out to sea
You took all my money and you give it to Richard Lee

[Verse 4]
Down by the river, Judge Simpson walking around
Down by the river, Judge Simpson walking around
Nothing shocks me more than that old clown

[Verse 5]
Some of you women, you really know your stuff
Some of you women, you really know your stuff
But your clothes are all torn
And your language is a little too rough

[Chorus]
Shake, shake, mama; shake it 'til the break of day
Shake, shake, mama
